    "postText": "I am currently taking home ~$1200 every other week after taxes and 12% into my Roth 401k. My rent + utilities comes out to $1000-$1050 per month. No kids. No other loans or large recurring expenses besides normal food/gas/etc. 33/M. Insurance would be $130/mo.\n\nI've been riding out an old 99 Mercury beater car. The engine gave out and the cost to repair far exceeds the value of the car. I wanted to get something that was nicer for once. The most I've ever spent on a car was $6000.\n\nIt's this a bad idea? I used to be a mechanic (no access to a lift and limited tools now) so routine maintenance and minor repairs I can take care of.\n\nEdit: actual biweekly take home pay is $1322. The amount financed is $16000 (after the down payment) @7% APR over 48 months",

            "comment": "Do you have any savings or emergency fund? Is the $400/month car payment before or after a down payment? How long is the financing for? $2400/month- $1200 (rent, utilities, insurance) would leave $1200 for the month BEFORE the car payment and food, gas, etc so $800 after. I would say it's too much if you don't have any savings in case any emergencies arise, but that's just me. If you feel like you can make it work and don't feel like it would cause you to be tight with your budget, then go for it if the car will last you at least 5-10 years.",

If you don't *want* to, fine, but there are ways to adjust to this.\n\nOne thing you should think about is that that three-mile commute is absolutely going to destroy any car you get. That is hands down the worst thing you can do to an engine: frequent, short trips. If you're a mechanic, you know this. So either get a beater, knowing that you're destroying the car anyway, or get an e-bike or something for your three-mile commute and *rent* cars for your occasional trips to visit friends. People constantly over-buy cars for occasional use, when the prudent thing to do is to buy for your most frequent use.",

Don\u2019t know if this is available to you where you live but what I did was donate plasma twice a week. It paid out $115 per week or $460 a month and there was usually bonuses for hitting consecutive donations that would always push that to about 500+ per month. For roughly 12 hours of donating per month, it covered my needs. \n\nLook into a second source of income such as that. If you\u2019re in a good area, you can also use that new car to deliver for doordash(my bro does this and makes 100+ almost daily.) or drive for car share like Uber/Lyft. \n\nWouldn\u2019t take much extra work to get you the $400 plus gas and you can work on your own time. \n\nIdeally, if your job allows it, pick up OT to cover that $400 car payment.",

I know many will say Toyota or Honda but there is a large premium for those vehicles. For the fusion avoid the ones (after 2016?) Which had the water intrusion issues. If you need a truck (not want) then there is nothing cheap. Even the beaters have stupid prices right now. Unfortunately you are in the market when prices are still inflated and interest rates are high.\n\nI have been in your spot and I went ahead and bought the car but I had a job with a state government that was stable and not going anywhere. I didn't have much choice as I needed something reliable and wouldn't cost me a ton in upkeep or fuel. It worked out okay but you do have to watch expenses. If it is possible in your area, be on the lookout for higher paying positions.\n\nIf you can put a bit more down, you can get the payments down substantially. I'm not going to pretend there are a lot of options out there in the market as there are not. I have been looking for a bit now and there is nothing decent in my area under 18k. Under that you get into vehicles with 200k+ miles and/or have been in one or more accidents.",

After that, the next 5 years included moving 3 times to different places in the city, changing jobs twice, travel, good 3 year bout with depression, etc.  \n\nI still had to put cash into the vehicle too for tires, suspension, body repair, glass replacement..... I regretted buying it but I was able to get 35% back on it when I sold it a year ago. \n\nIf I could go back in time, I probably would get a similar vehicle but pass up on the higher trim level for something a bit more basic.  You don't need leather seats, GPS Navigation (phone nav is better than automaker software now), multimedia, upgraded sound system, bigger rims...... In the end it all becomes outdated and the true value of your car after 10 years old is how much mileage you put on it.\n\nMy advice is that life comes at you fast and when it rains it pours.

I'm in my 40's and I've never owned a \"new\" car. And frankly, I'm okay with that. As long as it's only a couple of years old and freshly detailed, it feels new.

Fuck that. If you can purchase something that will improve your quality of life and that you\u2019ll enjoy it, without overstretching your income and stressing yourself out, do it.\n\nWhat vehicle are you looking at, by the way? Your budget would snag you a mid-2000s Lexus LS if you wanted a big, comfy, quiet, luxury cruiser that\u2019s incredibly well-built. When the occasional maintenance item or repair does come up, you\u2019ll be able to DIY it. Worth considering!",

I would find it really hard to budget the rest of my expenses with just 35% left (really 23% after your Roth contribution), which in your case is about $840 ($552 after Roth).

I understand and even agree with dumping the Mercury, you're your own hero for sticking it out this long. \n\nDo you know your 3-bureau FICO? That rate is not good. Just cherry picking some examples, NavyFederal has 72 months at 5.04%. A regional CU from my hometown has 60 months at 5.5%. \n\nIf you're buying a used car that isn't a 40K mile 2 year old Camry or similar Honda, I'm genuinely concerned you're going to end up in another mechanic scenario before your note is even paid off. \n\nWhen finances are relatively tight but your overall spending habits are in control, I'd take the long note with high confidence over the short one with limited confidence. I assume as with the Mercury, your goal is to buy this vehicle and \"drive the wheels off\" as they say - make damn sure you're getting something that matches your goal.",

You can work easier toward paying it off earlier as well and have the wiggle room to pay less if times get tough. 250 is easier to swing than 400.\n\nI think you can find a decent Toyota Corolla or comparably reliable vehicle in that range.",

In our household, we drive a 2005 Civic and 2010 Town and Country, and we plan for routine maintenance, and at least one $500-1000+ repair per vehicle each year. We just spent around $900 for suspension repairs on the van. I hate when the repair jobs pop up, but I really love not making payments for car loans each month.

Think about it, if you make 80k a year, which is 28k-ish more than the median from 25-34. You still wouldn\u2019t be able to afford a base Hybrid Camry. With 5k down payment, and a 60 months loan at 4% that would cost you 547$ a month WITHOUT insurance. Yes, Americans spent a lot of money on cars, but you might enjoy your car, and people don\u2019t account for that. I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable paying that amount of money if with your take home salary, but according to the 10% rule you also wouldn\u2019t be able to do it with an 80k salary, honestly if you want the car, have savings, and the money leftover from the month, go for it",

Do you get enjoyment out of driving? As long as you can save reasonably and pay for necessary items I don\u2019t see why not. If your not a \u201ccar\u201d person and get no pleasure from it I wouldn\u2019t recommend it.\n\nFor example when I was taking home about 3k a month I got a 530 car payment, was it higher than most recommend? Sure, but I enjoyed that car so much, I didn\u2019t spend much on other activities because part of the car payment was my \u201cfun money\u201d budget. You just have to be aware you can have it all, so while having the $400 payment you may need to sacrifice on eating out; traveling; etc\u2026only you know your interests and wants.",

            "comment": "I'm gonna be the guy that says yes, although my one caveat is, would you have an appropriate emergency fund after the fact?\n\nMy financials are almost identical to yours, and I just bought a brand new base model civic.\n\nI've driven junkers all my life as that was always by far the most economical decision, but with used car prices completely whack these days, I went for the new option. My original plan was to spend 10-15k cash on a lightly used vehicle but that option is completely nonsensical in 2023. That amount now gets you an 8 year old car with nearly 100k miles on it...\n\nI have been saving cash while I drove my $3000 junker for the past 2 years (the junkers been in use for about 5). It had started developing moderate mechanical issues so i decided now was the time. I saved 20000 in less than 2 years, and put 10000 down, financing 17000 at 3.9% over 48mo (even with an 800 credit score they offered me 14% apr LOL. I convinced my mother to cosign as we are on great terms and I've always had terrific financials). With how much I save I am likely to simply pay off the rest of the loan in the next 1-2 years, resulting in interest only costing me &lt;500. Although securing the low apr has me not sweating a damn thing.\n\nMy plan was to take my time to purchase a new vehicle, but I noticed MSRP on reliable economy cars is set to skyrocket for 2024 models. CVT impreza, Corolla, and civic are all going up by about 2k MSRP into 2024, so I decided to snatch something up. \n\nI was tired of doing my own mechanic work and just wanted the peace of mind of driving a car I never have to fucking worry about for the next 20 years of my life. I will still likely do my oil changes at least :). Sinking my hard earned cash that was saved specifically for this use case feels like a perfectly sane financial decision, even IF we ultimately aren't making that much money. If you're able to do all of your own work on your car when it comes to it down the line then that's just more money in the bank.\n\nI wanted something nice for once. I literally eat chicken rice and beans. \n\nIf you have a decent chunk of cash in the bank after your down payment, and you're sure your spare income can cover payments no prob, then you sound a lot like me and I think you'll do just fine.",

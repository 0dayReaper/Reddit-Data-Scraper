    "postText": "A while back someone via reddit contacted me via chat and we started talking. I was of course apprehensive because I did not initiate the contact. Very quickly into the conversation, she unprompted sent me a picture of herself. Very attractive Asian woman, but an appropriate picture, not xxx rated. I initially thought it was a bot but still don't think it was. She kept trying to get me to use WhatsApp. Before I could even think of downloading the app, her acct was either banned or deleted.\n\nFast forward months later:\nI received a text message from someone asking for another person. I replied back she had the wrong number and person. She then continued the conversation for some reason and once again, unprompted, sent a G Rated photo. Once again, a very attractive Asian woman.\nOut of nothing but boredom I continued the conversation. She then wanted to continue on WhatsApp. Once again I was bored so I tried the app. I point blank asked if she was selling something or doing onlyfans or something. She got offended. I still continued the conversation.\n\nAs far as I can tell, she's not a bot. I think I would notice. However, it's clear that there's about to be a scam going on. What can I expect?",

You see it as a boredom cure; they see you as a mark. \n\nEnd the convos, block, don\u2019t participate in a conversation like that again.\n\nOh, and yes she\u2019s either a bit or a man sitting behind a computer in a room filled with other men doing the same thing.",

Tone can be difficult to convey over text.\n\nYou are exhibiting vulnerable tendencies towards being a victim of scammers.\n\nYou will eventually be sent some sob story and asked to transact some sort of financially related materials.\n\nPictures being G rated are meaningless.\n\nFriend... I urge caution and recognition of your vulnerability. Scammers feed off of trusting and kind folks.  There is nothing to be gained by any further interaction. \n\nIn general, be wary of *any* messages sent to you privately from anyone you do not actually know.  In fact, stick to prioritizing interacting with people you know and tune out any internet strangers (including me).",

It\u2019s safe to assume you are not talking to whoever is in the picture. \n\n**Please** cut off communication with this person entirely. They are going to try to guilt you into continuing communication because they probably send out tens of thousands of messages to random accounts.\n\nGetting you to go to another app makes you more \u201cinvested\u201d in the interaction and its an **app that money can be sent over**. This is all part of the manipulation and scam.",

They'll eventually sob story getting money out of you via guilt trip.\n\nI got the text version of this, the person didn't initially start with anything but exceptional English and real replies so I also humored it, but I used fake personal information, the only real thing was the phone number. Inside 2 weeks of talking, their texting devolved into what could only be believed to be poor use of Google translate, but they made it a point to tell me their father was a prolific businessman in another country, they owned their own company in one state, lived in another state, but couldn't use their cell phone at work so they wanted me on WhatsApp. After pointing out scammers use WA, they said \"what have I given you that would make you think I'm like that?\" to act like I had offended them, then ghosted.\n\nThey build rapport that they are someone with trusting, via good looks and money, then try to trick you into sending money because they \"clearly\" are well off in life, just ran into an emergency where they can't access vast fortunes but they'll get you back, promises.",

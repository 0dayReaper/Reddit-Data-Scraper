There is also if you want to do international, usually something like 20% is advised.   \n  \nSo if following the above, it would something like look like:  \n  \n\u2022 60% Large Cap EQ Index  \n\u2022 15% Mid Cap EQ Index  \n\u2022 5% Small Cap EQ Index  \n\u2022 20% Non US Equity Index  \n  \nWell, I rounded to nicer numbers.  \n  \nThough I personally only do I think 10% in total international market (I do some in a semi-conductor fund and whatnot that include international companies though).",

If we look at VT (Vanguard\u2019s World fund, its 60/40 for US/International) it\u2019s 10yr is +8.26%, if we look at FSKAX (Fidelity\u2019s US Total) it\u2019s 10yr is 11.36%  \n  \nAssuming $10k/yr, here is how much that would be for 10yrs (well, you have fees and whatnot, but close enough):    \n  \nFidelity 2040: $143k  \nVT: $147k  \nFSKAX: $170k",

Also depending on your income\\\\match etc...  I would probably put in up to the company match or so and do the rest in a Roth IRA if that's available to you. so you have some pre and post tax dollars working for you.",

    "postText": "In my credit card's April-May billing cycle, I spent **$770** eating out as *one person.* I decided to track my spending in this area by putting all my meals I've been eating out on a credit card used only for that purpose. I looked at the end of the month and was absolutely dumbfounded at the amount of money I was spending eating out. I thought it might be $300ish dollars! \n\nAnyway, I paid off the credit card (angrily) and made a vow I would eat at home at every possible meal I could for the foreseeable future. I've spent about $70 a week on groceries, (was about $50/week prior) so plus $42, I went from and $1000/mo food expense (how the ever living hell was I making ends meet with this?) to $322/mo. And the kicker is I still have tons of food leftover at the end of the week. The only two meals I bought this month were a BK chicken sandwich while I was on the road and a birthday meal for someone. \n\nIt feels awesome to have a 70% reduction in spending in this area just due to self control. \n\nI'm planning on using this self control in other areas. Next one is booze and cigarettes. Then my shitty habit of mobile game micro transactions. \n\nSometimes I don't know how I've made it this far without being broke.",

            "comment": "That is amazing! Dining out can add up so fast. I recently started budgeting more strictly and it's really satisfying to only spend money at restaurants when it's necessary or is really worth it. Not spending $12 on a sandwich at lunch when I could just bring one from home makes me feel so in control of my life haha.\n\nThat said, sometimes dining out is worth a little money. Once you feel like you're in control of your spending I hope you let yourself indulge from time to time! ",

There's a lot of healthy recipes out the for them and all you have to do is through all the ingredients into the crockpot and turn it on for a few hour. Here's a really really easy healthy recipe that I enjoy. \n\nEasy lentil tacos\n1 cup dry lentils (brown ones)\n1 cup dry\u00a0 brown rice\n4\u00a0 cups water\n4\u00a0\u00a0 beef bouillon cubes (or chicken, vegetable)\n4\u00a0 teaspoons chili powder\n1\u00a0 teaspoon cumin\n2\u00a0 teaspoons onion powder\n1\u20442 teaspoon garlic powder\nThrough all ingredients into crockpot for a few hours until done\nGoes good with some saut\u00e9ed peppers and onions. Easy to do as well just cut them up and throw in a pan with some oil and cook till the onions are nice and golden. \n\nThrough out your junk food. I mean literally, if you want to get serious go into your kitchen and go through your cabinets and just start throwing shit out. It's a waste of money I know but you have to start some where. Then go to the store and start with just buying fruits and vegetables the kind that you don't need to cook. Also try to buy fresh only. Frozen peas and corn is fine but the bigger stuff like broccoli and green bell peppers I prefer fresh. You don't have to eat all the veggies raw either you could steam them and add some seasonings to them thats easy to do and hard to fuck up. Can also get some chicken breasts fresh or frozen and pan fry or grill them with your veggies. Breakfast is also an easy thing to do. Egg sandwiches simple and fast so stock up on that stuff. \n\nI've kind of gone with a more\u200b vegetarian diet but you don't have to. I'm only eating meat about 2 or 3 days out of the week. But I was also 280 at 24 so I need a big change now I'm done to 235 and falling.\n\nFinally the biggest thing for me was portion control. You know how on the nutrition labels they say \"based on a 2000 calorie a day diet\" yeah I did that, less actually. You can still have some of your favorite junk food but just check the label to see what a serving is and follow it. For me it's oreos, could eat a whole pack in one sitting if I wanted to but I checked the label and it's two per serving at 110 cal. So I just did that only had two per day. \n\nThis will be hard at first but once your past the 2-3 week mark it's a lot easier. \n\nPS. Sorry for the long post. ",

( My opinion, obviously) I would recommend starting with maybe breaded cutlets and chicken parms or meatball parm or normal pasta, some sloppy joe or anything you would enjoy making and eating. Then once you are able to cut fast food out  from your diet entirely slowly start making meals healthy. Maybe drop the breadcrumbs on your cutlet, start subbing pasta for wheat pasta, start swapping out the bread on sandwiches for some veggies, swap out beef for turkey....etc. Slow and steady wins the race my friend.\nSource: Experience",

(I get my cows by the half or whole with others so mah steak is cheap). For a family of three we usually spend less than $75 a month eating out. We do *maybe* one sit down dinner, usually when visiting family an hour away, or hit up some cheap fast food out of necessity. We usually spend $350 or less a month in groceries. I know people I work with that spend probably $200 a month eating out for lunch. Only lunch. Then bitch about being broke. Learn to cook! It's cheaper AND healthier. ",

Just try and reduce total spending by concentrating on not eating out.  This will encourage habit formation when it comes to food.  After that, you can move on to booze, cigs, and in-app purchases.

I read about people getting grumpy when they quit - I had full blown withdrawal.  Headaches, nausea, extreme drowsiness, complete inability to focus on anything.  And that was like, 3-4 hours after quitting.  \n\nI started taking Chantix in late March and my smoking gradually went from 22-30 cigarettes a day to about 7-10 with absolutely no effort on my part.  Then last month I was just like, \"Yeah, I'm done,\" quit on May 12th.  I live with my fiance who smokes and there has been no temptation to start smoking again.  \n\nI've also had zero side effects except for vivid dreams.  I know it gives a lot of people nightmares but mine are just really boring but vivid, like last night I dreamed our apartment complex had a garden and the whole dream was me weeding row after row of vegetables.  \n\nI hate to sound like a Chantix commercial but it has seriously been a miracle for me.  It was also free with my insurance which was nice.  I've also only been smoke free for like 5 weeks so take this glowing recommendation with a grain of salt.  It's hard for me to imagine taking up smoking again but who knows.",

Vaping was the only thing that worked to help me quit smoking, and I tried the gum, the patch, etc.  Prior attempts made it 5-6 months before I was back on the tobacco sticks.  But I'm 6.5 years  off tobacco now with vaping.  I do still vape, but it costs me all of $35/mo (I don't personally mind the nicotine addiction, thought that's also significantly reduced now, too -- I'm of the mind that addictions that harm no one are harmless, and in that respect nicotine without the burning plant matter is no more harmful than caffeine without the sugar).",

Guy looked at me like I was an idiot and acted like he couldn't help me because I didn't know what I wanted.\n\nI just imagine going into a vape shop now for legit vape stuff and I don't know anything about it and being looked at like a stupid idiot again. \n\nI know it's so incredibly dumb, but that's been my only hold back to vaping.",

You guys must be wasting some of those groceries and then eating out instead\n\n1.) Grocery: You need to examine your grocery receipts and then track how much grocery food waste you have.  Can you use more coupons or buy items when they are on sale?  Also, where are you shopping?\n\n2.) Eating out: Then look at how frequently you eat out and how expensive those places are. Can you cook more at home to replace eating out as much?  Maybe cook meals that last 2 nights or use crockpots more",

But I used to teach cooking classes so I know how to cook/ shop and I hold back unless company, kids or a holiday is coming. We average $125 every other week. I'll buy a chicken, roast it and then eat a stew, tacos or chicken and rice the next couple days. I hate it that people are hatin' on you for your expenses but kids food budgets can get high. ",

Some areas have MUCH higher cost of food and teenagers eat more than a small child. I'm a family of 4 and since my baby started eating really food budget has gone up. Also has special lactose free  milk needs. With dining out toiletries and grocery we spend about 1k a month. If I had two teenagers I can see it going up a lot. We also try to eat low carb which can add to cost. ",

You can also do crockpot meals where you drop everything in before work and it'll be ready when you get home. Basically you either find meals you can make quickly so things like hamburger helpers and box mixes that cook in thirty minutes and just need meat added, or you cook in advance. I usually alternate between the two depending on how stressed I am with work.",

Food delivery for that same distance should not cost *more* than this, if anything it should cost less due to the comparative value of the cargo.\n\nWhat most people don't get is that not only are you paying such a high fee, but the restaurant paid a hefty fee as well, ranging from 9%-24% (ChowNow on the low side, Amazon, UberEats on the high sides.  Between what you as a customer pay and what the restaurant pays, it's going to be around 5x what that Uber ride would have cost you.\n\nRestaurants have delivered forever without having to charge fees like this.  Dominos does it all day for $3.00 + tip opportunity.  It's going to take a company that puts this control back into the hands of the restaurant.",

Apples and oranges are the most common fruit. Strawberries making an occasional appearance.\n\n4. Cereal in the morning. Exclusively so.\n\nThat's most of it.

He then pointed out how much I was spending. My jaw dropped at how much I spent. So he took me to the grocery store that weekend and I spent $45 on food that lasted me the following week. The thought of not wanting to spend money on fast food resulted in weight-loss and saving up for big purchases (gaming PC, paying off my motorcycle, etc). Now I just cook my own meals for the week and eat a big meal at my favorite restaurant on Sundays for $30. ",

I saw that you wrote hat most of the money was spent on fast food and Uber Eats, but a lot of people also go out with friends for food. How have you mitigated this? (Inviting people over for meals is fun and cheaper, but it's still an extra expense and can be time consuming for you and friends!)",

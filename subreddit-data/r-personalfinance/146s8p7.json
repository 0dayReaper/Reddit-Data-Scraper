    "postText": "The typical advice seems to be to try to max all tax advantaged accounts prior to personal brokerage but there seems to be flaws in this if you want to retire way earlier than 60. For example if you would like to live off of $50-60k in todays dollars and you\u2019re investing ~$60k/yr, at certain institutions you\u2019ll be able to put almost this entire sum of money into tax advantages accounts Roth(6.5k) 403b(22.5k) 457(22.5k) HSA(3.85k) for a total of 55.35k. \n\nThe problem I foresee is if all this will be penalized prior to 59.5 how do you survive till that age if you retire at say 45? You\u2019ll have a loaded 59.5 retirement but not much in the years from 45-59.5 that most would argue are much more valuable. Is there something I\u2019m not understanding or is it just that the typical advice doesn\u2019t make sense in my circumstances?",

A \"Roth conversion\" ladder is just a straightforward application of Roth conversions. The US government created Roth contributions and Roth conversions specifically because they *want* people to get the income taxes from retirement contributions sooner. Why would they penalize people for doing exactly what they want?\n\nAlso, if they did close those \"loops\", your worst-case option is just paying the 10% early withdrawal penalty to get that money out before age 59.5. Which is not that big a deal. You'd have to be *really* confident that those other techniques will cease to exist before you forgo real tax savings to avoid a theoretical future 10% tax penalty.",

Additionally, that HSA can be distributed anytime (save up those receipts).\n\nAnd then there's the 72t rule which has already been highlighted to you.",

You could do that every year for 15 years at 6% assumed growth and not have that level of savings. \n\nYou should also have considerable savings outside of tax-advantaged accounts.",

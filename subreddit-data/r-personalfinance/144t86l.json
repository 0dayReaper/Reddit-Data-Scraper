    "postText": "I\u2019m looking into moving in with my sister who is a few years older than me. It works out great for both of us because I\u2019m ready to move out of my parents house and she could use a little help with bills. What is a fair percentage of the housing costs I should pay her in rent each month? Not sure if I should shoot for 50-50 or if it\u2019s fair for me to pay more like 40-60 or 30-70 since she is the one that will be left with a paid off house in the end. Just a rough estimate of her mortgage, power, and water is probably around $1500 a month.",

I rented a room from a college friend who had her own house and she arranged a price that was somewhat proportional to the size of my room. For that roommate, she thought of my rent as \"bonus money\" and took care of the utilities herself rather than clearly dividing them with me. What has your sister proposed? It's really gonna depend on how much she's expecting you to help out and don't worry about changing the agreement down the line if you revisit it and find the price off.",

            "comment": "&gt;What is a fair percentage of the housing costs\n\nThat isn't relevant. What matters is what she could get if she rented it to someone else. So find out how much rentals are going for in the area.\n\nAnother reason housing cost isn't relevant is that probably she doesn't know what that is. Sure, she knows what her mortgage note is but that isn't the total cost. There's other stuff like property taxes, any maintenance work that has to be done, saving up money for a roof replacement in 20 years, that sort of thing.\n\nNonetheless, a fair rate should start by looking at rental rates in your area.",

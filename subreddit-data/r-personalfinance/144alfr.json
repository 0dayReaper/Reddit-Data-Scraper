    "postText": "I am selling my car via Craigslist and the Buyer is purchasing with a loan from a local Credit Union in Washington State. \n\nWhen I went to the Bank to prove I was the title owner and it was a kosher deal, the \"People Coordinator\" handling the transaction did not seem knowledgeable about the paperwork. He tried to make me sign a power of attorney over to the bank for the car for the title. \n\nWhen I looked on the WA DOL website, it stated that as the Seller, I only needed to sign the Title and Report of Sale.\n\nQuestions:\n1. Who is the Buyer on the Report of Sale (Bank or person taking the loan)? \n2. It is my understanding that once I file the report of Sale then I am no longer the owner of the car, so why would I need to sign the Power of Attorney to the bank? Why wouldn't the person buying the car sign it?",

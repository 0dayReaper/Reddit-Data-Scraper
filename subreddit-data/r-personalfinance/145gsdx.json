    "postText": "Hi r/personalfinance, here because I guess my parents and education taught me nothing about finances and I desperately need more informed input. I (24F) am a non-traditional medical school applicant, first-generation college student, and am missing four undergraduate courses because I didn't know I wanted to be a doctor until my gap year after undergrad. I make about 2.5K a month as a part-time personal trainer while also juggling Medical Assistant school (which I got all 4K of it paid for through a grant program) and have 1K in a high-yield savings account (Ally). I also use Acorns for my Roth IRA (sitting at $900) and Investment Portfolio (sitting at $950) (just spare change accumulating- contributing only $10 a week to each) but if I should reconsider doing this, I did it to feel better about contributing to my financial future with the realization that having no adult job and being a student it's quite difficult. I also do side jobs and make an additional \\~$500/mo. I also have good credit, and use less than 3% of my available credit. My monthly expenses:\n\ncar insurance: $198\n\nrent/utilites: $950 (I have a roommate and just live in an expensive city, I regret this, but my lease isn't up until Feb 2024)\n\ngroceries: $480 - I 90% of the time eat at home bc my roommate and I meal prep, rarely eat out and if I do, partner often covers it as he understands my situation and he's financially very secure with a fantastic 200K job :')\n\npersonal things/gas/oil change/randoms: $300-ish (yoga classes, car maintenance just little things that add up)\n\nMy dilemma: I need to go back to take a few undergrad classes, but just found out an advisor **did NOT TELL ME** that a non-degree seeker like myself would not qualify for Federal Loans (for which I qualify, need-based) to pay for my tuition of 4K that I JUST PAID. I only have 7.5K in loans from undergrad, no interest, that I don't need to make payments on until later this year because I was able to work my ass off for scholarships, etc. I have no credit card debt, as I pay it off each month. My options are third-party loans (terrified of these APR%) or to withdraw from all of my classes to receive a portion of that money back and basically regroup. Y'all, I'm having breakdowns about this, and just so bummed that I was led here with no support and under false pretenses. Any guidance or thoughts/comments would be so appreciated on how I can remedy this unfortunate potential loss of 4K that I literally do NOT have.\n\nP.S. any financial guidance on how to prepare for medical school applications (multiple thousands in investment \\*cries\\*) and also taking out massive loans for med school are welcome, as it's in my future and I have zero people in my life to help me understand what steps I need to be taking to set myself up for success.",

            "comment": "As someone who knows many doctors. Please consider the financial ramifications of medical school itself. Many doctors I know who have now graduated medical school find themselves in hundreds of thousands of debt. You cannot discharge this debt if you leave school early. Additionally in a health care system that no longer compensated physicians fairly, you will feel trapped doing work that may no longer be meaningful. I\u2019m glad your thinking about finances so soon in your career, however medicine has changed even in the last decade so much. Best of luck!",

It\u2019s not something I super recommend, but you could open a new card with 0.0% promo APR and pay it off over a few months. Just make sure you actually pay it off (and don\u2019t employ this tactic in the future!). \n\nTax-wise, you just need to rollover the money from your Roth to another Roth. Brokerage doesn\u2019t matter as much. You\u2019ll likely just be selling at a loss. The market has not been great in general, so even once you switch it likely won\u2019t go up a ton, but I don\u2019t recommend keeping it in Acorns.",

            "comment": "I know that when my son got poor counseling on which courses would transfer and had to take a different physics class (they were wrong again) in the summer to stay on schedule he was told that there was no Financial Aid for summer classes period. \n\nCan you take out a personal loan just to get this done. \n\nHow will you finance medical school? I don't know how it 'works' but do know that a lot of people went to Medical Schools in other countries because it was cheaper, often in English. I believe there are still some in the Dominican Republic for instance, maybe Costa Rica?\n\nI'm a Retired RN, but with elderly parents where I unfortunately spent a lot of time talking to doctors, nurses in hospitals and various facilities in recent years. The changes in the last 10-20 yrs are really shocking. I use to recommend to everyone how great nursing was, not anymore.\n\nThese Health Care Systems are taking over the landscape, hospitals no longer compete for staff or best doctors except for specialists. Primary doctors no longer seem to visit their patients or even check in on their patients. I've been told they have little to no authority within these 'systems' over the care of their own patients.\n\nAlthough 'Intensivists' have been a thing for a long time in Critical Care Units they were specifically hired for particular units and were there to assist the doctors when they were not there. So when I worked in Open Heart for example we were pretty autonomous but the intensivist from the Coronary Care Unit was there every day making rounds, reading charts and if we needed something. Consistency of care. There was no such thing on the regular floors.\n\nNOW they have Hospitalists, I talked to a few when my parents were in. They will tell you they rotate every 7 days and are responsible for 30 patients each. However my Mom was there for a week and she had 3 different doctors in that time. None of them knew her information or history. I kept a notebook of all doctor's orders, all tests, labs scheduled, her medications etc. Every day it was the same thing and I had to repeat everything, essentially give them report on what was going on with her rather than them giving me an update.\n\nMy son's GF is a 2nd yr resident, applying for Fellowships for next year. If she doesn't get one she will need to go to work and start as a Hospitalist, likely the night shift. The pay starts at $185K, if she finds a Fellowship the pay after finishing would be shy of $300K. Now she's here on a J? Visa, she went to medical school elsewhere, but in order to stay here when finished she will have to work in some underserved area in the US for 3 yrs before she is granted residency. She does get paid now $60K. She looked like death a couple of weeks ago in the middle of a week of 12hr night shifts. It's a rough/rough road to hoe, that takes years and years. \n\nNursing is not as bad, Nurse Practitioners make pretty good money and can be essentially like Primary Care physicians under the license of a doctor. I myself have been seeing one for over 20 yrs, she's much better than the doctor she works under. There are also different specialties they can choose to practice which long term makes nursing more interesting and always has to me. Over 2 decades plus I moved around every 3 years or so, from OB/GYN, to oncology, to Open Heart, to NICU, various management roles, ultimately to Executive Director of a large Home Health Agency. There are lower levels and steps to take to get where you ultimately want to be. Some hospitals have tuition reimbursement as well.",

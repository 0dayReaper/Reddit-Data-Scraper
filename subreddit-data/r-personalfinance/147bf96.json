I invest about 50% of my post tax income.\n\nI need to buy a replacement truck. It's our 3rd vehicle. Currently driving a 2005 Dodge RAM 1500 with oodles of engine problems at 150k miles. I just use it for house work like lumber, landscaping, etc. Thinking about getting a fishing boat in the future which would involve driving 3-5 hours each way some weekends and what I have now I just would not trust to not leave me stranded hours from home with a boat in tow.\n\nA r[eliable 4x4 truck under 70k miles](https://www.autotrader.com/cars-for-sale/vehicledetails.xhtml?listingId=684085220&amp;allListingType=all-cars&amp;bodyStyleSubtypeCodes=FULLSIZE_EXTEND%2BCOMPACT_EXTEND&amp;city=Arlington&amp;driveGroup=AWD4WD&amp;isNewSearch=false&amp;makeCodeList=FORD&amp;marketExtension=include&amp;maxMileage=75000&amp;maxPrice=40000&amp;modelCodeList=F150PICKUP&amp;numRecords=25&amp;referrer=%2Fcars-for-sale%2Fall-cars%2Fawd-4wd%2Fford%2Ff150%2Farlington-tx%3FbodyStyleSubtypeCodes%3DFULLSIZE_EXTEND%252BCOMPACT_EXTEND%26isNewSearch%3Dfalse%26marketExtension%3Dinclude%26maxMileage%3D75000%26maxPrice%3D40000%26numRecords%3D25%26searchRadius%3D50%26showAccelerateBanner%3Dfalse%26sortBy%3Drelevance%26zip%3D76006&amp;searchRadius=50&amp;showAccelerateBanner=false&amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;state=TX&amp;zip=76006&amp;clickType=spotlight) is going to run me $30k-35k. A new truck is going to run me $45-50k but there's 0% interest for 36 months on right now at Ford.\n\nIf I buy used, I'll pay cash because screw 7.9%. If I buy new I can do 0% and put an extra $30k into my mortgage. I don't need to buy now, but I'm trying to find the smartest path to upgrade within the next 6-12 months. If it's 0% for 36, I should take the offer at Ford now prob, if it's the used route then I should wait til the fall to let prices drop a bit more on used?",

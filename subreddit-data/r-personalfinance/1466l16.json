So yeah, I bet your boss could afford to pay you more, as you assumed.",

Your standard pool store that also does cleaning (Pinch A Penny is popular) charges $160/mo for their top-level service (weekly vacuuming &amp; filter cleaning) for an average sized pool, not sure about bigger pools or their lower services.  \n  \nSo customers essentially pay about $25/visit.  \n  \nHis YTD gross is high though as that includes his equipment purchases for the customers who reimburse him (an automatic pool sweep for instance is in most of his accounts, and the unit he usually gets for them is $300, plus filters/floaters/etc.).",

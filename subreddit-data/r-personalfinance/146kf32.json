    "postText": "With the indexation already past, it\u2019s probably a bit late to look at this more in-depth but I\u2019m curious to know how much of an impact of it would have on mortgage rates / borrowing power etc. \n\nI have about 30k in HECS, and I\u2019m just letting that same amount sit in savings. I am investing but not with the 30k that this would be used for. Does anyone have a spreadsheet/calculator that would be good to determine the difference between saving, paying it off and the impact that has on trying to buy a investment property?\n\nI\u2019ve always thought of it as a huge opportunity cost but at the same time, it\u2019s towards a deposit and in the meantime only used in a savings account.",

                    "comment": "You say realistically there's little to calculate but I guess it's more for peace of mind in that case. To me, there are a few factors in play here.   \n1. Debt is debt, no matter how small. Even 1-3% can affect future goals and such should be considered. So knowing how \"cheap\" this debt really is, would help.  \n2. Savings gets taxed at about 30%. Meaning that my interest rate isn't really what I think it is since I assume that gets taxed. Eg. current rate is 4.75%, reduced down to 3.4% or something like that  \n3. Opportunity cost - In terms of deposits, mortgage rates, how do banks consider HECS in the calculation of repayments, interest rates and borrowing power? Would I be able to get more by having the deposit cash, or will I have more borrowing power if I paid off HECS debt. This is the real question I'm asking",

                            "comment": "I got a mortgage with a full slate of outstanding HECS debt so it factors in very little - there's no pressure whatsoever on these loans and the repayment stipends are small. Effectively, it looks like a marginally lower pay packet on their end. There's no pressure on this debt at all and no interest - it's variably adjusted for inflation but in my experience that's pretty modest. My partner's a CA and before I was paying it off through my professional salary, we were better off putting the money into high-yield savings until we had our deposit ready. And then, paying down the mortgage was far better value.\n\nFor context we bought our apartment in 2008. I finally made my last HECS payment at some point during COVID I think.",

                                    "comment": "I think that makes sense. pardon me if I misunderstand anything, it's all relatively new to me. But I understand HECS debt from a lender's perspective, they consider it as reducing my payable income, would that be right? Since it's reducing a small margin of my income, about 5% or less depending on income.   \nI guess the difference of 30k later on would outweight the benefits of having 15k (potentially saved from HECS paid off) and $0 towards deposit. These are not calculated values but just as a overall idea. And like you said, there's the money that would be paid towards a mortgage would also incur less interest on a much higher debt.",

    "postText": "Hi folks!\n\nThrowaway because I don't want people knowing us learning more about our finances.\n\nWe are in the process of purchasing a home with a whopping 9% APR. The reason that the rate is so high is we are both on F-1 visas which is not eligible for most lenders. Other than that, we satisfy all the criteria including excellent credit and income. No other debts, and we're doing good financially.\n\nObviously, such a loan does not make sense under normal circumstances. However, we will receive some family money within the next year that we'd be able to pay this off almost entirely. Also, we'll be on another type of visa that's eligible for most conventional loans in 6 months. So, even if we may decide not to pay off, we can refinance approximately in 6 months.\n\nThe reason we want to buy now is that we don't want to move again. We moved cross-country twice in 5 years, and this is going to be the third time. We're pretty tired of it. This is the location we'll spend a longer time. So, we thought we take the loan, pay the high interest rate for a couple months, and then pay it off.\n\nThe rental rates vs the mortgage payment with this high interest rate is almost quite similar. With this high interest rate, we will not be making almost any payment towards the principal in the first year. However, after purchasing, we will also be able to renovate some of the thing we want to renovate. We just thought, instead of renting something and then moving again when we buy, we take the high interest mortgage and then at least we settle in the house we want to settle. Once we receive our money, we pay it off and move on.\n\nDoes that make sense to you good folks of r/personalfinance? Anyone has some ideas that we could be missing out?",

            "comment": "Is the mortgage payment the same as the rental payment if you include closing costs and repairs?\n\n- Closing costs can be a big chunk of money, and don\u2019t make sense for a short-term purchase. \n\n- For repairs, the general recommendation is to plan to spend 1% of the house\u2019s purchase price, annually. If your house is $250,000, $2,500 annually. This is on the conservative side.\n\nAs always, the NYTimes rent or buy calculator is a good thing to check.",

                    "comment": "These are good points, thanks! So, if we buy after renting a year, we'll still have to take on some mortgage and there will still be closing costs involved. We will be able to fully pay cash in two years, and in one year we'll be able to do something like 70% down instead of 30% down. Also, once we buy a house, we plan to spend a very long time in this house. So, it's not a short-term purchase in that sense. Maybe our closing costs would be lower with a higher down payment next year though, so running some simulations would indeed be a good idea!\n\nRepairs are a good point, too. We're only looking into newer houses and we have a great inspector but we recognize those don't guarantee a trouble free house.\n\nCounter to this, we're worried with a potential drop in interest rates starting in 2024, demand for housing can go up again. The house is in a high appreciation area with no more land to build new houses, and if demand increases for housing once again, we're worried we wouldn't be able to purchase cash and and we'd have to take on a mortgage again.",

If you two are high earners with in-demand jobs, that may be no issue. If the house is very affordable and you have jobs that are very steady, also another great possibility. So basically\u2026hard to tell. Buy the house you want to buy and need. Don\u2019t try to time the market.",

Start building equity then refinance when you're able to get a better rate. \n\nBest thing you can do is pay down the principle as fast as you can so the interest matters even less. Putting 20% down to not have to pay for mortgage insurance is the quickest way to save a lot of money. If you can't put that much down, every month put extra towards your principle and you will save tens of thousands of dollars over the course of your loan. 100$ a month on a 300k loan will shave 7 years and upwards of 60k off.",

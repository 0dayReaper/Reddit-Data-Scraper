    "postText": "So I have managed to climb my out of all credit card debt - I do have some remaining balances on credit cards on a 0% APR period and the card will be paid in full by the time the interest starts accruing. \n\nThat essentially leaves me starting on even ground for the first time, with the exception of money that I owe on taxes. I owe nearly $5k federal and several grand to state, although I\u2019m not sure of the exact amount. \n\nI have 3k in an HYSA and would feel more comfortable with about 8k as a safety net in a VHCOL area, but I do have a lot of job security. \n\nI have $0 in retirement savings at this time. My 401k match will not kick in for about 6 months. \n\nMy question is, do I start to prioritize paying down the debt on taxes owed? I have them on a payment plan and it doesn\u2019t seem to accrue much interest (at least compared to cc), so I was hoping to build more savings, but would it make more sense to pay this off and then start contributing to a retirement plan? Should I divide the available funds and contribute a smaller amount to both? For reference I am 30f and only recently learned anything about managing my personal finances, so I have some catching up to do.",

I would say just continue to follow the payment plans and use anything left to build up your savings. Once you have your $8k cushion, increase your 401k contribution.",

Or it depends?\n-\tcurrently contributing $150 out of each paycheck, but I don't see employer contribution at all. Is it because it is hidden? Or employer will contribute in lump sum by early next year?\n-\twhat does waiting period mean? been with the company for over a year, and only start to be eligible for the retirement plan after the first year, is this the waiting period? If so, shouldn't I see the employer contribution? Or it means employer contribution will come only after 1 year of being eligible for the plan?\n-\tcan I rollover the plan to IRA just like 401k?\n\nI know I can ask the HR for all the questions but it is wife's employer and wife's financial knowledge is no more than a high-schooler. She asked them 4 times yet still can't answer any of the question.",

It's not a match, but it is a employer contribution. \n\n&gt; google page says employer contribution for profit sharing is immediately vested, is it true for all 401k profit sharing plan? Or it depends?\n\nDepends. I believe there can be profit sharing plans that are *not* 401k plans. But 401k plans can definitely have vesting periods. \n\n&gt; currently contributing $150 out of each paycheck, but I don't see employer contribution at all. Is it because it is hidden? Or employer will contribute in lump sum by early next year?\n\nThere is no employer match. Once a year, they put 7.5% of her compensation in the account. Her contributions have no connection to this. \n\n&gt; what does waiting period mean? been with the company for over a year, and only start to be eligible for the retirement plan after the first year, is this the waiting period?\n\nSounds like it.\n\n&gt; If so, shouldn't I see the employer contribution? \n\nHas she met the requirements you mentioned?\n\n&gt; Or it means employer contribution will come only after 1 year of being eligible for the plan?\n\nSounds like she has to be there for 1 year before she can participate at all. \n\n&gt; can I rollover the plan to IRA just like 401k?\n\nSure, once she leaves the job.",

There's just a 1-year waiting period. Your daughter should find out the vesting schedule as well. If it's immediately vested that's way better than most employer match plans out there.",

She will likely get profit share the first year, but it\u2019s not vested, meaning if she leaves she can\u2019t keep the money the employer contributed. Let\u2019s say she started in June 2022 and makes $150/ month contributions. Feb 2023 the company paid her $3000 profit share. If she quit in May 2023, she would only have what she contributed in the account (~$1650). But after her one year anniversary, she\u2019s vested and keeps all $4600 and will receive all future profit shares vested right away.",

    "postText": "I have about $500,000 of debt. \nDebt breakdown:\n- 110k is credit card debt, ranging from 15-28% APR.\n- 235k is unsecured personal loans, ranging from 15-34%.\n- 155k is student loans. I have just graduated and will start paying these back in 6 months. \n\nMy monthly payment towards these debts is around $13k. The age of each debt range from 7 years old to as recent as 10 months. \n\nI pay $6850/month in rent and have found a new apartment for much less but have another year left in my current lease and my landlord isn\u2019t letting me out. \n\nI am 26 and I earn $335,000/yr gross\n\nI have about $50,000 in real estate and long term investments (I Bonds, CDs, etc) which can take quite a while to cash out if needed. I have 2 months worth of rent and utility in short term investments ($20,000) that I can liquidate with a few days notice. \n\nI have $110,000 in my 401k\n\nI do not have any other assets.\n\nI have let it get too far and really need to take a hard look in the mirror and cut this out, and I\u2019m considering my first option as don\u2019t buy anything except the bare necessities and take out a loan from my 401k to attack my highest interest debts (401k borrowing max of 50k to pay off 50k 34% APR debt). Focus on paying that off and snowballing the rest of my way through my debt, while trying very hard to move out to a 5k lesser apartment. Hopefully my plan is in three years, I\u2019ll have no debt, no loans, and a much more controlled spending habits. \n\nIs there any major pitfalls that come with a 401k loan in this circumstance, anything I may be missing, or anything I should do prior to a 401k loan?\n\nThanks for your help!",

The typical use case - high volumes of money spent on flights and the like that's then immediately reimbursed by work - is also used by people wanting to juke their limits to be much higher. It's pretty easy to get a high limit *relatively* quickly (I know AmEx touts \"no limit\", but that's not reality) on the charge cards if you know how to scale your purchases - and more critically, pay them off immediately.\n\nAmEx does have good risk modeling (and I'm an unabashed fan), but there is certainly a flaw there.",

You could also break the lease.  Landlords typically have a duty to mitigate losses by marketing and renting to someone else.  You may have to pay several months rent even though you aren't living there, but you likely will not have to stay in the lease for a whole year.  Probably worth talking to a local attorney about",

If u will physically destroy, delete numbers from all IOS wallet and saved credit card it will help to prevent from meaningless and momentary craving to purschase some BS.\n2. Extra money from step 1 try put to another credits.\n3. Cash out from all investments and pay your loan UNLESS U MAIKING for example 30% APR ON cd that honestly is impossible.\nI did the same literally couple days ago. Paid 150k CC. I did 500k last year and this year minus 40k, it was super painful.",

Keep only one months' expenses as a buffer.\n\nIf your credit score is good enough, look for 0% balance transfer cards for the credit card debt.

You shoyld be making short or anyterm investments at all...nothing is going to make more than those intetest rates are costing you\n\nMaking $335k gross immediately after school pretty dam impressive but renting for $6850 when you have $500k in high interest debt is extremely wasteful bot sure what led you to do that.  You dont need a $6850 rent place.\n\nId stop the wheeling and dealing, put down this gucci crap you seem to be doing take a hard look in the mirror, take the debt seriously and pay it off with your impressive income over the next several years.  No investments, no $6850/mo rent apartment, no o fancy cars or whatever else you have going on to do that.",

Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors.\n\nCut out all vacations. Sell things you don't use anymore. Start a side hustle. Take on a temp part time job if you need to.\n\nWith your salary, you shouldn't have debt.

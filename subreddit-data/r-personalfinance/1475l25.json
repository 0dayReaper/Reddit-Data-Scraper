A hidden camera to collect pin \n4. A shimmer that is inside the card slot\n\nI seen a post talking about using a wireless device/method to get peoples card info/pin. For example said device was simply placed near the atm and recorded information wirelessly by hacking into the atm.",

Essentially the skimmer is a low power Bluetooth enabled device either inside the card reader or fitted on the outside disguised as an \"official part\" that collects the card information and transmits to a remote user/and server. I use mine on every gas pump/ATM/etc. NFC/near field communications is a different ballgame.",

Then the person tells you that you have to use the Tap function of the card on the ATM.  The issue is that if you do not manually *end* the transaction, the ATM allows additional withdrawals to occur (seems like poor design to me).  So after you walk away, the malicious actor withdraws more money.\n\n* https://www.10tv.com/article/money/consumer/consumer-warning-atm-tap-to-withdraw/530-4c6ee4d7-178d-43d9-a2f3-16a01e185129\n\n\nAn internet search reveals other ways.\n\n* https://www.livemint.com/news/india/atm-fraud-alert-debit-card-scam-credit-card-fraud-atm-machine-11682840589796.html\n* https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2019/05/everything-you-need-to-know-about-atm-attacks-and-fraud-part-1",

I seen someone talking about a wireless device placed near the atm was able to extract information wirelessly. When I look this topic up I cannot find any information on it though! So must not be a thing right?",

But there are always people inventing new ways to steal, so anything could happen some day, so there's no way to say definitively those are the only 5 ways possible.  No sense worrying about something that some dastardly person might invent someday far off in the future.",

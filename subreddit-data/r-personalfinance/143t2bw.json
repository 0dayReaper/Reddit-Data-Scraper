    "postText": "I finished paying off $12,000 in credit card debt last month, but I'm wondering if there anyone has any useful critiques of the plan I've come up with moving forward.\n\nI'm 24, and make about $4200 post-tax every month, but this is going up by about 8% in the next few months. \n\nI live at home. My fixed expenses (before my wants and any savings) are around $1200, but I'd like to be out and on my own in the next year or two. I don't mind it for now. Also, my car is old, somewhat reliable, and completely necessary to get to work and earn an income.\n\nI have been paying 10% of my gross income into a pension since I was 21. My total contributions amount to about $13,000. I have access to a 457(b), but no employer match, and I haven't put anything into it yet. It has some good offerings of low-fee, broad-based ETFs.\n\n**Accounts:** \n\n$1,200 in my high yield checking/savings,\n\n$830 in a Fidelity Roth IRA, \n\n$0 in Fidelity CMA (to be used for sinking funds/job loss fund)\n\n$300 emergency cash\n\n$150 in a brick and mortar bank just to have access to those services\n\n**Debt:**\n\n$18,700 total in federal student loans:\n\n* \\~ $3,800 @ 5.05%\n* \\~ $7,500 @ 4.53%\n* \\~ $3,750 @ 4.45%\n* \\~ $3,750 @ 2.75%\n\nThe minimum payment when payments resume is \\~ $180 / month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy plan is as follows:\n\n1. Max Roth IRA and continue to do so every year moving forward.\n2. Save a month's pay in my checking (4.2% APY) as a buffer\n3. Contribute to sinking funds and save for moving out\n4. Contribute any upcoming raises to my 457(b) and live off / save the money I currently make, perhaps contribute more when I have a cushion built\n\nDoes this make sense? With the loans being federal, and my interest rate essentially matching SPAXX or even my online checking account, doesn't it make sense to just pay the minimum? As long as I have enough cushion in my savings, holding the student loan balance doesn't bother me psychologically. I'd feel much better having access to more liquid cash than having the debt paid off but I am not sure if there is something I am missing here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks in advance",

It's not difficult to get a 5% return from banks or money market funds.\n\nAlso, if you do need to borrow in the immediate future, the rate will be much higher than the ones you currently have (particularly the loan @ 2.75%).",

Instead of that becoming fun money you take the amount you were paying pit it all ro whatever investments emergency fund ect you want. You won't miss  you'll be used to living like that and you'll be debt free pay it off for the peace of mind loans intrest ate not going to get forgivin and the loan holders are probably going to sue for all the back interest saying the gov never had the ability to say interest on pvt loans is uncollectible. \n\nLooking forward you pay them off you dont have to worry. You dont donethjng happens and in the future you cant pay them or you accure intreast. Slow wins the race pay the debt off first.",

    "postText": "Companies like National Debt Relief and Americor keep reaching out to me with debt consolidation offers. (Btw, both of those get an A+ from the BBB. Does that mean anything?)\n\nThese companies always say my credit score will decrease for a while, but would recover later.\n\nA lot of the debt came from job losses, medical bills, and unexpected events. But I expect to keep my job now and I actually make enough to cover my monthly credit payments, housing, food, gas, and everything else, and have plenty of cash left over. In addition to that, I make enough to pay greater than the minimum monthly amount, and have a few hundred dollars left over each month... the debt would be gone in 3 years.\n\nOtoh, going with the consolidators would mean greater monthly savings for me, which I could invest into my dreams and goals. Like getting married, for instance lol\n\nI just wanted to know what you guys and girls would do in this situation? Can consolidators ever be trusted?",

These consolidation companies will charge you extra money to do something you could yourself. They also have a history of missing payments to individual creditors.\n\nI would recommend a few things. First, setup a budget so you know where every dollar is going. Second, establish a $1000 emergency fund so next time you can use this instead of racking up more credit card debt. Third, use the snowball or Avalanche method to pay off your debts. Lay out each debt and list the amount owed and interest rate.\n\nFor Avalanche (mathematically best choice since it saves the the most money) means you make minimum payments towards all debts and throw everything else at the account with the highest interest rate. Once that account is paid off/closed, throw everything at next highest interest rate. Repeat until all is paid off.\n\nFor snowball (psychologically more satisfying, some people are more successful with this method since they get more \"wins\" and feel that paying off their debt is manageable and accomplishable), pay minimums for all accounts and throw everything else at the account with the lowest balance. Once that is paid off, move to account with next highest balance.",

It\u2019s up to you to analyze your finances to make sure it makes sense for you.  Look at the costs for consolidation,  look at the interest rates.  Are you losing student loan forgiveness if you consolidate?  Will your monthly payments go up or down?   Some loans allow income based repayment, will this new loan mess with that?  If the numbers add up then it makes sense.",

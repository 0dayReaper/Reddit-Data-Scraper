    "postText": "Hi! I\u2019m going to have some additional questions I\u2019m sure but my credit card debt has snowballed - I wouldn\u2019t mind paying the minimum payments for a long time but I may be getting laid off from my job and unemployment wouldn\u2019t cover the payments. If I got a personal loan to pay off my credit card bills, would that affect my credit? Would it increase my credit score because my credit utilization has gone down? Also, are pre approval numbers accurate? Discover gave me pre approval for 20.99% - this isn\u2019t good but my credit score is around 660 right now so it\u2019s probably the best I can do. If this is accurate, my payment would be around $550 a month instead of the $750 I pay for my cards now. Also, I know I need to change my spending habits - I\u2019m planning this for a worst case scenario situation.\n\nThanks!",

You didn\u2019t list current apr so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s around 27%?",

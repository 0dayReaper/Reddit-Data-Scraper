    "postText": "I imagine the answer to my question is something like \u201c#theeconomy\u201d, but I want to make sure I\u2019m doing what I need to do and am asking for suggestions. I spent most of my life paying out of pocket for what I needed. I made it until my late 30s before I needed to get my first loan. I needed to purchase a car. I was told by lenders that being this old without ever having a loan was a red flag. I shopped around but the best interest rate I could land on an auto loan was 9%. At the time my credits score was 709. I decided to buy a cheaper vehicle that I wasn\u2019t a fan of and build my credit score and payment history on a loan. This month I decided I wanted to buy a new car that I prefer. I had the car assessed and it has a $4,500 trade-in value after payoff of the loan. I still owe $11,000 on the loan. My credit score improved slightly to 714. On credit file is says I have perfect payment history and have never had a late payment. But the interest rate I have been offered for a new loan (with a similar vehicle purchase prices of the one I bought last year) is 13%. I feel like the rug has been pulled out from under me, now I am less able to buy the car I want even though I took advice to \u201cbuild\u201d my credit worthiness by taking out this loan last year. What am I doing wrong?",

You do not need to pay interest on a loan to build credit. Get a credit card, use it for regular monthly expenses, and pay off the statement balance in full each month, thus avoiding paying interest. That is all you need to do in order to build credit.",

Because I have a mid700s FICO and could get an unsecured personal loan at rates around what you\u2019re getting quoted for a loan secured by a vehicle.\n\nShop around. Work on building a credit history, and in six months you\u2019ll be better off.",

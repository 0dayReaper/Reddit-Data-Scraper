    "postText": "I dont know if this is the right place to post this.\n\nMy girlfriend applied to a job at a place called HCI group. Within one conversation online they hired her, and said they will send her a check for $4,000 to buy necessary equipment like software. \n\nThis morning, she received an overnight check from Patelco Credit Union for $4,415.\n\nMy dad used to tell me \"If it seems too good to be true, it is\". And this seems like one of those things. Does anyone have any info on HCI Group, Patelco Credit Union, company scams where they send you a cashiers and rush you? \n\n**Edit** Email she just received:\n\nYou're to deposit the check to your account and scan and email the atm deposit slip to me on ( redacted ) once done for confirmation, no need to send the slip to any other email address or email any worker that you got the package even if a note came with the check, have already contacted them they just want to make sure you get it, so you email the slip to my email address only, thanks\nNOTE: Make sure it's an atm deposit because atm is 24 hours service and funds availability, you need to order the equipment tomorrow once the full funds are available so that you can receive the Equipment by next tomorrow and get started.\n\nyou only need to take your atm card with the check to your bank's atm machine then deposit it into your bank account okay ? you will see the option when you get to the atm\n\n**Edit 2** Just talked to Patelco. A check for $4,415 was never issued from their company. Sending Patelco a picture of the check since they said its a fraud, and then shredding that son of a b. I've read all your comments by the way! We're just figuring out how to respond to a very needy spammer.\n\n**Edit 3** Scammers are angry at our non-responsiveness. They threatened us by saying \"you better cash in that check or their agents will find you\". I promptly told them to fuck off and blocked them. Patelco was very happy we called them, since now they know their company is being used for scams.\n\n**Edit 4** Just wanted to do another quick edit. My girlfriend received this job offer from her schools job network. She goes to a small, expensive private college and she got hit with this fraud through a secure network that needs to be approved by the school first. Always be on the lookout for scam. \n\n**Edit 5** We did NOT shred the check. We decided against it and are going to report it. \n\n**Edit 6** Blowing up much further than I expected this too. /u/iac74205 said I could report it to the postal inspectors if it came by USPS. It came by FedEx, is there a postal inspector for that?\n\n**Edit 7** We've contacted the school once to report the scam! My girlfriend is taking a shower and right afterwards shes A: Reporting it to the FBI and B: demanding that the school sends out an email blast to all of the students going there. \n\n**Edit 8** I said it in a comment below, but I just wanted to thank all of you for all of your advice. I've read every comment and we have a ton on our plate to take care of. The users of /r/personalfinance rock!\n\n**Edit 9** Reported it to the school, this was their message: \n\nHi Girlfriend,\n\nThank you for sending over this information.  We have flagged this employer in Handshake as fraudulent and have removed them as an approved employer as well.  I know that REDACTED, our Office Manager, has already created a warning in the system for them, and I will do the same with the information you have sent to me.  I will also discuss with our Directors about any further steps that need to be taken.\n\nThank you so much for reporting this!  Please let me know if you have any other concerns.\n\n**Edit 10** Using edits to answer FAQ's now. She did not give any information besides what would be on a resume. Work history, name, etc. She did NOT give bank account details or her SS number.\n\n**Edit 11** Just in case someone wanted to see what the fake check and the letter she was send looks like, [here you go](http://imgur.com/a/lfw0M)\n\n**Edit 12** I just wanted to confirm this, both Patelco and HCI are legitimet companies. We called Patelco and they have their fraud working on it. We didn't call HCI but I've had enough messages saying they've worked from HCI I believe its legit. I think this guy was just using the names to sound legit.\n\n**Edit 13** Ladies and Gentlemen, I need to give a shout out to /u/dotonfire /u/Kell_Naranek and /u/meanreds . They pointed out that the signature is Thomas Jeffersons. The dead are rising, and they're scamming /s\n\n**Gilded edit 14** I was just given gold. As much as I appreciate someone thinking a thread for asking advice is good enough to pay real money too, its unneccessary! If you are really feeling charitable, consider giving to a charity. Personally, I suggest [Doctors Without Borders](https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/onetime.cfm?source=ADD1600U0V53&amp;amp;utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;amp;utm_expid=7773760-9.T4pemk1yTFeOymrJr_YtIQ.0&amp;amp;utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F) or [PACER](https://pacer.ejoinme.org/MyPages/DonateToTheNationalBullyingPreventionCenter/tabid/229451/Default.aspx) . Use it for something more important than bragging rights.\n\n**Final Edit 15** Final edit unless there's anything super important that happens. Everythings been reported to the proper agencies, like the FBI. Hopefully we find this guy or get a response.\n\nNothing on our end was lost and we took all security percautions so we're safe. Thank you everyone for the advice and help! \n\n**Final Edit 15.2** For some reason I can't see this post on Reddit anymore besides direct link? Anyways, school sent out an email blast for other students safety. **[MAKE SURE TO REPORT FRAUD TO PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP PREVENT IT](http://imgur.com/gallery/mS8n0)**\n\n**Final Edit 15.3** I told my dad this got tons of upvotes. He replied with \"awesome\". Finally my dad is proud",

            "comment": "This is a common scam.\n\nWhat will happen is that she will cash it and three days later the check will \"clear\". Your girlfriend will believe that the money is free to use and will send moneygrams or the like to the places her \"boss\" tells her to, while keeping the agreed upon fee for herself.\n\nSometime later the bank will let her know that the check was a fraud. See, when a check \"clears\" after three days, that doesn't mean it can't still turn out to be a fake check. But your girlfriend has already sent the money out and only has a small portion of it left. Now she will find herself in debt to the bank.\n\nDon't cash the check. Discontinue contact with these scammers.\n\nEdit: I wanted to clarify what \"clears\" means, since there a lot of questions on it. When I wrote that OP would have seen the check \"clear\", clear was in quotes because the assumption is that if the funds are available that the check has cleared, but that isn't true. So it hasn't actually cleared.\n\nBanks will make funds available to you because there is both federal law the mandates this as well as a courtesy to you so you don't wait weeks for a check's funds to become available to you and upend your life, since most checks are not fraudulent and the money is needed.\n\nJust because a check's funds have become available does NOT mean that the check has fully cleared the bank. Most people do not realize it and think a check has \"cleared\" after at most 3 days. Scammers know both when checks actually clear and what the popular public perception of when they clear is and they use that knowledge to prey upon people.\n\nThey also know to use out of state or even foreign bank accounts as the supposed \"source\" of the bad check they send you since they know that local banks that run through the local Federal Reserve will be able to actually clear and verify a check relatively quickly, but it takes longer for non local banks. Checks are sent to [clearinghouses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_House_Interbank_Payments_System) in order to be processed and are not cleared by one bank calling the other bank for every single check to see if it is valid. All of this is to say that a check goes through several steps that take time in order to figure out if it can actually be collected upon. \n\nChecks are vulnerable to this sort of fraud which is why the [Comptroller of the Currency](https://www.helpwithmybank.gov/get-answers/bank-accounts/forgery-and-fraud/faq-banking-fraud-01.html) says:\n\n&gt; It's an example of why you should never accept a check from someone you don't know.\n\nChecks are an exercise of trust between you and the person giving the check and between you and your bank. Unfortunately for you, your bank can unwind a bad check and take their money back. If you have already turned that bad check into cash and sent it off via irreversible means like Western Union or giftcards then you are left holding the bag and the scammer keeps your money.\n\nAnd for those wondering what happens if you deposit the check and don't send anything to the scammer, well, the answer is only bad things. You don't keep any money (since there was no *real* money sent to you to begin with) and it is likely the bank will shut down your account for cashing fraudulent checks. They may also give you a black mark in the ChexSystems that banks use to vet customers before opening accounts for them. So you may find yourself hard pressed to be able to open a new bank account. So if you suspect that a check is a fraud, do NOT deposit it!",

Through a commercial entity such as UPS or FedEx it is generally a civil matter for theft of services, and it's up to them to pursue it with whichever law enforcement agency it might fall under, which they probably will not bother with.  You could report it to local law enforcement, and they MIGHT deal with the Feds if it was sent interstate, but it's all up to the PD what they will do.\n\n",

Maybe, just maybe, it's real, you think. You need to use this as a lesson in scams and start going through the most common scams out there to educate yourself. Anytime you come across this again - and there are always scams right around the next corner - stop and think to yourself if you are trying to get something for (practically) nothing.

Because you didn't lose any money, you didn't defraud the bank, you didn't cause any distress to the banking system, so this will be pretty much a non-priority to them. \n\nI tell you this because many people who fall victim to this sort of scam often want to go and get revenge for being duped and are often even more brought down and humiliated by the lack of any police response. But, if you know you will be able to take non-responses, go ahead and report it to the police. The USPS also has a reporting feature and you can report it to them as well, since this counts as mail fraud. I believe the FTC also has a reporting feature as well. Just depends on how far you want to take it.",

This was implemented to prevent banks sitting on people's deposits for weeks while collecting interest (back when interest rates were high).\n\nAn unintended consequence of this is that this scam is aided by clearing checks before the funds are made fully good.  Often scammers will exploit this by finding banks who would take as long as possible to process checks presented to them.  For instance, my (US-based) office once got a scam check supposedly drawn on Scotiabank of Canada for someone supposedly in the same state as us.  Naturally it would take quite a while for a Canadian bank to clear such a check even if legit, which is what the scammers are counting on.",

That's not a valid cheque so we're not doing that.\" At which point, the depositor's bank goes, \"Oops, your cheque didn't clear afterall. We're going to need those funds back.\"\n\nEdit: It's actually pretty common for banks to basically float you a no interest loan on partial amounts from cheque deposits. Hell, I even had a Credit Union who would give me the funds for my paycheck about 2 days before my employer sent it out since it was direct deposit. It's basically a courtesy so that if the depositor is tight on funds, they have access to at least some of it to tide them over until the bank can actually complete the transfer.",

[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jefferson,_Thomas_(signature_on_check\\).jpg) blows my mind.  1809, and the only real difference is the lack of a serial number)\n\nWhen you deposit a cheque, and your bank makes the funds available to you near-immediately - they're fronting you that money because they trust that your account isn't regularly shady.\n\nIf your bank could query the issuing bank to say \"does this account have sufficient funds for this\" .. there's still no evidence that this account(-holder) actually issued the cheque.  It's just layers of trusting normality until someone asks where that four grand went from their account.\n\nIt blows my mind that cheques still exist in 2017.  They're a promissory instrument that depends entirely on trusting promises.  If you don't trust someone to say \"I'll pay you back, honestly\", a cheque in their name is just the same promise dressed up in sheep's clothing.",

The downside is the bank wasted a little bit of time vs just telling the customer the check was garbage. \n\nHere is reference to the process on a banking forum:\nhttps://www.bankersonline.com/forum/ubbthreads.php/topics/279169/re-sending-a-check-for-collection\n\nAnother response that some banks use when customers attempt to negotiate checks like this is to immediately call the police, and report that the customer has been the victim of a crime. While the customer is still there.\n\nThis can be effective in helping even the most gullible or stubborn customers become aware that they are being scammed.

When the bank considers the funds available (usually on the next business day), but before the bank is informed the cheque is bad, the paper hanger then withdraws the funds in cash. The offender knows the cheque will bounce, and the resulting account will be in debt, but the offender will abandon the account and take the cash.\n\n&gt;Such crimes are often used by petty criminals to obtain funds through a quick embezzlement, and are frequently conducted using a fictitious or stolen identity in order to hide that of the real offender.\n\n&gt;This form of fraud is the basis for the Nigerian cheque scam and other similar schemes; however, in these cases, the victim will be the one accused of committing such crimes, and will be left to prove his/her innocence.",

To overturn an account closure due to fraud (I know this was a scam, but the bank will see this as a customer depositing a fraudulent check and according to the deposit account agreement the account owner assumes all responsibility with the deposited item) it will take the involvement of a lot of people, most likely including an \"override\" from a market director.  For a 17 year old with anywhere from $0 maybe $800 in the bank, this is very unlikely.  And from the bank's perspective, who is to say that if the customer has already accidentally been duped in to depositing a fake check that he won't accidentally do it again?  It's a risk to the bank, unfortunately that's just the way it is.",

One month later, after supplying my defense with all of the texts and emails, all charges were dropped and sealed. That was a very scary ordeal and a lesson to never use Craig's List for employment.

The guy claimed to be a part of some company that essentially buys old pianos and refurbishes them and resells them, so he already had a moving company lined up to pick it up. She was to cash the check to pay the moving company when they arrived to pick up the piano. So in the end, she would be in debt to the bank, and lose an entire piano.\n\nI probably messed up some details, but that's the gist of it. I hate these sorts of scams when it all seems legit on the surface, but it boils down to a bad check\n\nEdit: a word, and just to clarify this is what would have happened, if she had went through with the transaction.

About 10 years back I got a less than professional call from someone with a heavy mexican accent telling me I won the prize at Sam Goody's (I had put in my info/address for a contest in their store, lesson learned).  Somehow they pulled out my info and wanted me to come down right now. \n\nSensing something was off, I called the store manager, they hadn't finished the contest.  I live in a remote area, they wouldn't find my house if they tried, but I saw someone in a few streets over in a van casing houses, got their license # and called the police.   Police being the police never told me whether they caught them but that was a scam 10 years ago and now they are doing things like getting account #'s for legitimate company orders, PO's.  It's scary, everyone is effected, and at one time or another you will encounter this, always be suspicious.  Last one I had was someone calling stating they were with the Veteran's Administration wanting to do a survey, from a phone #844 which is known to be linked to fraud.  \n\nNever trust anyone, sadly this is where we are right now in the world.

            "comment": "Similar thing happened to my boyfriend last summer. He responded to a job listing of a business executive looking to hire an assistant and was hired within 24 hours. The guy mailed my bf a check for $4k saying he was out of the country and needed my bf to buy a bunch of expensive artwork and supplies for him and drop it off at a specified address. He also said my bf was free to keep whatever was leftover as his initial fee.\n\n\nLuckily my BF caught on quickly that this must be a scam, a quick google search for check scams and check frauds showed this was fairly common. The scammer expects you to cash the bad check and use that money to buy them goods, then sometime later the check bounces and you owe all that money back to the bank while the scammer gets off scott free with the valuables. \n\n\nMy BF didn't report it but he kept the check and straight up stopped responding to the guy. When my bf stopped responding the scammer also started getting more insistent and angry until he blocked him. The check looked pretty real so I wouldn't be surprised if there are plenty who do fall for it. Good for you for being skeptical! Trust your gut.",

It was for the wrong amount by 2 grand and they said I could keep the difference for accepting packages on their behalf and \"paying some bills.\"\n\nSomething felt sketchy so I contacted the bank it was drawn from and they told me it sounded \"very suspicious.\" in an email after I weirdly enough had to leave my information in a voicemail.\n\nI went to the cops, explained what happened and they took copies of my emails and the texts. They said nothing could be done about it but having it on record would save me a hassle if a package of drugs or stolen goods showed up at my house and another agency was tracking the package. Apparently some of these scams use individuals to launder the source of stolen goods and drug shipments.\n\nI told the guy I went to the cops and he flipped his shit on me, coming within an inch of violating the law by implying \"things happen to liars\" but it wasn't enough for the police to act.\n\nThe next day their website was gone. The *bank* website was gone as well telling me they set up a fucking fake bank website to field calls and questions from dumb saps like myself. The company website was gone. Only the number was still active.\n\nI got drunk that weekend and Lobster Trapped the phone number.

Thankfully I didn't go through with it, but it took me longer to understand what was happening than I'd like to admit.\n\nSome red flags to look out for:  \n1. Poor grammar. A lot of these emails are sloppy in sentence structure/don't capitalize things.  \n2. If they are responding to a post you put up, they tend to ask questions that are already in the post.  \n3. They send cheques that aren't in their name (mine told me her financier was sending me the cheque, which was super sketchy).  \n4. They use language to make you rush through the process. My scammer said things like \"due to limited time\", your own scammer threatened your girlfriend with agents finding her (what the fuck?).  \n5. When they send (or claim to send) the cheque, they may then claim to have \"accidentally\" sent you more than the agreed upon amount. They will then ask you to wire transfer the excess to some random account. This way, when the cheque is found out to have been a fraud and is withdrawn, they will also have received more money from you. My scammer sent me a USPS tracking number, but I never even got a cheque, but they asked me to wire transfer the extra amount before I even received it.  \n\nEither way, it's great that you went with your gut and at least asked other opinions so you didn't fall for this bullshit.\n\nEdited for formatting.",

If you want to apply for a job here you almost always have to give your bank account information. No serious line of work pays their employees with checks. Everything is handled through your bank account. From your salary or welfare or pension, to all your regular expenses like insurances, rent, downpayments...up to tax returns. Checks are almost non-existent. The thing about bank transfer is: once you transfer money to a different account, it is almost impossible to get it back. A scam like op witnessed wouldn't work that way.\nOn the other hand, if someone withdraws money from your account (your provider draws the monthly fee for your mobile phone for example) you actually can revoke these.

Even if you work for what seems like a legit business, and they are paying you, as soon as they ask you to use a personal account for something other than direct deposit of a paycheck, travel expense reimbursement, or bonus that is a major red flag that some type of fraud is underway.",

    "postText": "To make this easy: You've got 20k to invest in a brokerage account. 10k into VTI. 10K into VXUS. Wait six months, a year, pick your time-frame, dividends reinvested. You've now got 11K into VTI. 9K into VXUS. You decide you just want to roll the whole thing into VT. You sell both. The capital gains offset the loss? What does that look like on a 1099 for tax time?",

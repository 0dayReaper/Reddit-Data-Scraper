If they had a higher deduction and got the money earlier, they would have spent it on something small and would not have the money to make a larger purchase. For some, paying extra money in taxes is like having the government be their piggy bank of sorts. \n\n\nYou are right. It is best to be financially prudent, save money well, and optimize deductions. Unfortunately, very few Americans are financially prudent. Most spend too much. Most save too little. And most don't have adequate savings to retire at a reasonable age. Paying too much in taxes is not optimal. It is not quite as bad as failing to save 15% or more of your income towards retirement, but optimally your tax refund or additional tax liability would be minimal when you do taxes. ",

Overpaying taxes by $20 per month or per biweekly period is not a big deal. Having a refund of $2,000 is a much bigger deal as you are effectively giving the government a $2000 loan for free. \n\nWith that said, paying too much in taxes and getting a refund at the end of the year is a fairly small mistake. If you are saving well otherwise, the consequences are relatively minor and not worth stressing about. We don't always optimize all our financial decisions. As long as you are generally making good decisions, you can choose the piece of mind route. Even $2,000 worth of money not getting interest for a year is not a significant difference. 1% of $2,000 is $20. 10% is $200. The opportunity cost of the $2000 likely falls somewhere in between at maybe $50 to $100 (or much less if it would just be in a bank account). \n\nTLDR: Don't sweat the refund if it gives you peace of mind. It is a relatively small thing for optimizing finances and not as important as having a good budget and saving well, which you indicate you currently do. ",

They have to do most of the work anyway (calculating what people owe), so their marginal cost to issue a refund is probably relatively small. There's going to be a break-point where they lose money, but your refund would have to be pretty small to hit it, maybe below $75? (Assume a $.47 stamp with a bit added on for an envelope and check, though many people cost less by doing it electronically). Maybe double that in practice, as most people don't pay all their taxes at the beginning of the year, which reduces interest? The numbers are pretty speculative, as I'm not acquainted with the IRS's finances.",

I also have sufficient savings to pay any outstanding taxes without much trouble. I prefer optimizing my tax payments because it allows me to invest more money. \n\nI usually invest all my unused money every few months. This usually gets rolled into a non-retirement investment fund as my retirement investments are automatic each month. My returns vary as my non-retirement investments are usually in stocks and I gain or lose money based on how the market does. In the last few years, the returns have been much more than 5%. \n\nWith that said, we are talking very small numbers here and peace of mind is important. Big changes like saving more and spending less can make or break your finances. Small changes like optimizing a refund makes little difference and you can be very successful without worrying about it. \n\n",

I'm an RN, I had a full time job where I was making $4200/month gross and then I picked up a per diem position elsewhere where I made $33/hour with unpredictable hours cause it was per diem. I did that for about a year. I increased the amount that was taken out of my paycheck in my primary full time position and I did the normal deduction from my per diem position (where they call you in when they need you), but not enough was taken out and I owed $950. So yeah, the following year, I had more taken out and then I actually had to quit that per diem job less than half way through the year, and I got a return. So I think it's good to have that amount to fall back on in case your income becomes wonky. Like maybe you have to go on unemployment, or disability, or maybe you get a new job where you make a lot more money, or a second job, etc. Obviously if you have a steady job with a predictable income, it's good to make it so you're not giving the govt an interest free loan, but I think it's good to have that safety net.",

I've never seen him go out and make a major purchase with it.

I do get a little sad if I actually owe money for taxes at the end of the year though.

That's something you learn in the most basic microeconomics 101 course. Taxation is always a big gaping hole or a net loss to the economy.\n\nEDIT: Also, cutting *corporate income tax* is a GIGANTIC economic stimulus. It means corporations have less of a reason to ship jobs overseas. They can also pursue riskier projects with tighter profit margins, which result in more innovation / new products that wouldn't have been innovated otherwise. When they perform the calculation to whether it's worth it to ship jobs away, suddenly the corporate income tax taking a giant bite out of their profits isn't part of the equation, which makes things much riskier for corps who want to ship jobs away. The practice is less likely to be profitable.\n\nCorporate income tax is double taxation and part of the reason the USA loses jobs and capital. The best tax policy is to cut corporate tax down to zero and put that tax burden on the top X% of private earners. \n\nSource: See points #6 and #7 here. \nhttp://money.cnn.com/2014/08/14/news/economy/corporate-taxes-inversion/",

The issue in my situation is that I often work side jobs, sometimes 1099 and sometimes w4. For me, tax time often ends up with me owing. Due to a lot of changes in my career, my dad stopped advising me to try and keep working deductions for now and just using my additional federal withholding at my regular job to offset the tax liability from other jobs. Now ideally I would track it throughout the year, and save my estimated taxes, and earn interest on that money in the meantime. But given what interest rates are, the lost opportunity of earning interest is not much compared to the security of knowing that while most often I will owe on state, I have that interest free savings account with the bank of Uncle Sam to offset what I pay out of my regular savings. I guess this is a niche situation but it works for me because I don't have to worry about it. This is probably the last year I do it this way as my income has gone up and I am doing less side work.",

Since I make enough in freelance work for it to be non-negligible, I find it easier to just have more withheld from my primary employment so it comes out in the wash in the end.\n\nSince I can't accurately predict my liability a year in advance (and doing taxes once a year is bad enough I don't want to try to keep track of it on a regular basis throughout the year), I'd rather pay more in tax and roll over the refund into my IRA than end up with a liability at the end of the year and a lack of funds to cover it (or needing to take funds out of savings) in the case of simultaneous rainy-day expenses.\n\nBut yeah, I also agree with many people that having the government stop me from spending my money is helpful.\n\n**TL;DR** Multiple sources of (unpredictable) income and making my life more convenient.",

You are taxed as if you are going to earn over the threshold. I believe it's around \u00a310k, if you earn less you pay no tax. \n\nWhen you factor in work and education in for the average 19-22 old, it's fair to say most would be around that threshold. Missing out on/doing a few shifts in a bar/retail environment could literally tip the balance between whether or not you receive one.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, the excitement is there because it's unexpected money. You wake up to that letter off HMRC \"Hey, we owe you money, get online and it can be in your account ASAP.\" and it justs makes you happy. \n\nGiven the scarcity of money for many young people in education or shitty low level part-time work, it offers a welcome respite from the struggle, and a chance to improve your quality of life, or get something new &amp; shiny.\n\nHope that gives you another perspective. \n\nEdit: Grammar",

Having a sizeable check to pay off credit cards from the holidays or just blow in general can be attractive to people in that category. \n\nPersonally I don't like the idea of getting a large tax return. I admit when I was in my teens I enjoyed it but now that I've learned more about the financial world I rather not get anything. The money you get back in a tax return could have been setting in an investment portfolio making you money for months before you ever get it back from the government. The more money you get back on your return the more profit potential you've lost out on throughout the whole year. \n\nOn a side note I don't necessarily blame the American population for being that way. My fiance and myself had a discussion last night about how little our education system prepares us for the financial world. I graduated high school in 2008, so relatively recently, I wasn't taught about anything as simple as a 401k and the massive power of investing early in life. It was barely touched on in college and that was only by a teacher that genuinely cared about the future of his students. ",

Even if they didn't like that the majority don't know how they could adjust and monitor their withholding to come out about even, and if they have an idea they are afraid to do so because they are intimidated by the system and calculations.\n\nI worked at an tax service that did individual returns a few years ago and the majority of our returns were relatively simple returns that people could easily have prepared themselves.  But they didn't understand how taxes worked and they didn't want to understand.  I've tried to explain to people how they could increase or decrease their withholding but so many couldn't even understand why they'd want to or that doing so might impact their paycheck or their refund.\n\nYou'd be amazed how many people who've increased their earnings are upset can't comprehend why their refund didn't increase in proportion to their earnings.  They get angry at the preparer, don't understand the system and don't want to learn about how taxes work.",

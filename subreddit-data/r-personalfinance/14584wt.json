    "postText": "Hi everybody. I'm currently in salary talks with my employer. I've had two offer which were both too low for me and a conversation with my manager inbetween receiving these offers. I now have the option of talking to my manager's manager and the HR manager. I already gave my manager all my reasons and both her and the HR manager said they are reasonable and understandable. \nBefore I ask thesse questions to my manager, I was hoping for input from more experienced people on the outside: How should I approach this talk with the senior manager and HR manager? Should I be more specific with my arguments (which already were very specific) even if HR manager know them?",

Your Manager might literally have popped her head into HR and went \"hey my employee wants a raise, can you shoot them something\" and that's it. Go in, make the same arguments you made your Manager and see what happens. No matter what they offer, understand this is your last offer and say thank you and you appreciate their time and consideration. If they don't offer what you want you leave. That's all there is to it. Many companies are constrained on what they can offer employees and this is a big part of why people job hop.",

I think it's a better investment overall, given that if you are willing to save receipts until retirement it's got more tax advantages than 401k or Roth 401k.   I might be missing something.",

We're taking it as a given that we can stockpile receipts indefinitely to justify tax-free withdrawals. You may find that that is no longer the case by the time you retire. Over decades, tax policy and IRS guidelines change. If legislators come to believe that HSAs are being widely used for avoiding taxes for the middle and upper middle class, rather than boosting incentives for health savings, they may change the law and not grandfather anyone in\n* State law variance. If you are one of the 15% of the labor force that live in California or New Jersey, your HSA contributions are not deductible, and capital gains are taxed. Other states may change their tax policies in the future. Meaning you may be socking away investments in an HSA expecting them to be fully capital gains tax free like your 401k including at the state level, but when you retire you may find that's no longer true\n* Distorted health decision-making. If we recommend prioritizing contributing to an HSA over other retirement savings steps, some readers may be likely to choose a high-deductible health plan so that they are eligible, even if it's not the right coverage for their needs",

You\u2019re also tying your ESPP income with your employment so if your company has a downturn, you risk layoffs and a hit to your ESPP balance (I\u2019ve seen this happen at the company I just left.)\n\nESPP also is not tax-advantaged like retirement accounts. \n\nI would personally prioritize your retirement but not leave ESPP on the table. I would personally keep the ESPP and sell it exactly at 1 year to hit long-term taxes, hoping it does appreciate during that time. \n\nSay I planned to put money into all the above, I\u2019d do 401k match, max HSA, put an amount into the ESPP to your comfort level (perhaps 5% of income) with the intent of it being mid-term available money, not immediate nor held long-term, then max IRA then 401k if possible. \n\nIf you invest non-retirement currently outside the ESPP I would probably put no more than 40% of that money into the ESPP, to not double up too much on the same source. People sometimes go hard on the ESPP, then the company tanks. But 15% is a good discount. \n\nThese are all random numbers that fit my risk profile.\n\nThe ideal long term play would be to max everything retirement first. However, I personally want some non-retirement so I can fund that trip to Japan I\u2019ve been saving up for for a few years, get a nice car, whatever $10-30k thing I\u2019m thinking of from a portion of those stocks I\u2019ve been buying for the last 8 years without touching my emergency fund.",

    "postText": "I went out to dinner on Saturday night. After splitting the check with my girlfriend, the bill came to $19. Used one of my credit cards, left a tip, kept my receipt and walked out. That charge had been pending until today where it posted as a $228 charge. It would have been easy enough to slip buy if I didn't check my accounts often, but I knew something was wrong right away.\n\nCalled the restaurant, explained the situation, gave them the order number and table number, sent them a photo of my receipt and it's being corrected. So this is a friendly reminder to monitor your accounts and keep your receipts often!",

About 15 minutes after a man runs in, literally in tears, hysterically crying. We made eye contact right away, and his expression just told me everything I needed to know that he owned the bag. He just looked at me and softy asked \"did you find it\" and right away we both knew what we were talking about. I handed him the bag and I felt my self being able to breath again. ",

I called the pharmacy and gave them the guys name and asked them to contact him and tell him I had his pills.  He came in and was kind of rude, like I'm the one that made him drop his script. This is not at all like 25k, but as a newly recovering pill addict I was really proud of myself for not pocketing the bottle and pretending like it didn't happen. \n\nEdit- Gold! Thank you!

Guy walks into coffee shop looking stressed wearing what he said he'd wear I approach him with a smile and hand him his phone and he just snatched it out of my hand and walks out looking annoyed. It was so rude, not even a thanks!! He acted like I stole his phone for fun or something. ",

Whenever my parents cooked something I hated (which happened a lot back then) I would pocket the food so it looked like I ate it, then get rid of the evidence later. My parents were huge subscribers to the \"If you don't like what I'm cooking, don't eat\" as well as the \"Clean your plate\" philosophies. Throwing food away was a HUGE crime in our household, practically tantamount to punching a baby in the face. \n\nI think that's enough backstory. \n\nI left my breakfast of scrambled eggs in my jacket pocket once and forgot about them. Later that day, I realized my jacket was missing. My mom and I had gone grocery shopping earlier that day, so we headed there to see if they had the jacket. Customer service asked what color the jacket was and we told them. The lady then said, \"Oh! The jacket with scrambled eggs in the pocket!\" and returned the jacket... along with a little plastic Ziploc sandwich baggy full of my breakfast. \n\nAnd since this is reddit, there may be a question about whether they made me eat the eggs and the answer is no. No, I did not have to eat the linty scrambled eggs. I did have to submit to what was basically a TSA-level search of my person post meal for a long while, though.\n\nAs payback, I have found some dead bugs in one of my kid's jeans pocket before. He was planning to keep them as pets but it didn't work out.\n\nI realize none of this is as heartwarming as your story, it just reminded me of that time. ",

I used to work at an airport, and we'd have passengers with $10,000+ in cash on a fairly regular basis. \n\nPeople who are stressed out or have a lot on their mind, good or bad, can easily forget things they don't usually carry and don't have on their automatic mental checklist. We had all sorts of things left behind at the airport by travelers, laptops from the banking and defense industries, personal technology worth thousands, and on one occasion, a $12,000 cashiers check, for example. You never know what's on another person's mind, and the more unusual the thing they're carrying, the more likely there's something particularly unique or stressful about their situation which can cause the forgetfulness. Something like a bereavement can utterly destroy a person's ability to think at the exact same moment they're handling all sorts of stressful affairs, and potentially inheriting a large quantity of money.",

If you were carrying $25k in cash that's probably the only thing you'd think about the entire time it was in your possession. In his case he took home the week's worth of cash on Sunday to get it ready to deposit on Monday. He'd been doing this every Sunday for around 10 years. It had long since become routine.\n\nOne time he needed to stop at Walmart for a few things on his way home and, tired and overworked, he inadvertently left the cash bag in the cart when he pushed it into the cart corral after unloading his cart into his car. He didn't notice until he got home and went to grab the bag to bring it inside. It was probably twenty minutes that that bag full of cash sat in the cart in the parking lot of walmart before he returned and luckily it was still there waiting for him.\n\nI think he was a bit more diligent from then on.

They were a older couple and I got their things and handed it to them. The woman paid me. I went in and got her change only for her to tell me she had given me more money than she actually had. \n\nI told her she only gave me $10. not $20 Change. She wouldn\u2019t listen so my mom went and gave her the money because she wouldn\u2019t leave our drive thru.  we did call the non-emergency number to have them escort her and her car out but the police didn\u2019t come in time. (They said they would have arrested her and towed her car lol) \n\nAnyways like a few days later I guess she was in church and she opened her wallet to find her missing $20 there. She came back and gave us our money back and apologized. Told my mom to tell me she was sorry for being so rude to me. It\u2019s the first time a customer has ever been so damn honest. ",

When we had an overage like this (greater than $5-10, or anything a penny or two to either side of a bill denomination), we'd take up to an hour during close to try and rectify the error. Whether we discovered the source or not, we'd set the overage aside in the safe.\n\nIf we never figured out what it was for, we'd use it to offset shorts. But when we figured out what it was from, we'd either contact the person (if we have their info), or set it aside with their receipt in an envelope in case they came back.\n\nThat $100 was probably sitting in an envelope the entire time waiting for him.\n\nNot to say what they did wasn't honorable or good, but it seems in line with the pretty standard practice I've seen in food and retail.",

I have them at $10 to catch most transactions, but let the small charges to not bother me. \n\nSo I agree, check if your credit card has a mobile app as it adds a good real time double check on activity. The one thing is it would not catch a restaurant screwing up a tip. So you would probably still need to double check activity which is also easy using the app.\n\nEdit: several people have asked where the setting is. Hopefully this helps.\n\nChase Android app: left hand menu -&gt; alerts -&gt; manage alerts\n\nThen you can manage alerts per card by clicking the (+) in the top right\n\nCiti Android app: left hand menu -&gt; settings -&gt; Account Alerts -&gt; Set up new Notification",

This helps for two reasons: one, if a waiter/waitress fudges the tip line, I know that's not what I gave them and can call the restaurant to discuss it. Two, I sometimes just don't remember what I paid. I might have spent more than I meant to and see the charge and have some sticker shock, but with the receipt, I can say \"oh, no, that's right, that's just more than I remembered\". Without the receipt, I'm calling the restaurant to contest what they charged, which is a hassle for all involved and honestly kind of makes me look like a fool.",

There have been many times where I've worked (use to wait tables) and the customer, while kind and generous, has the most atrocious hand writing or tallies the total wrong. Therefore even if the tip line clearly states 20.00, if the tip line does not agree with the total, we go with the lesser tip value. Shitty, but any  restaurant has its fair share of credit card charge backs and we try to avoid that as much as possible.\n\nOP's case sounds purely like a mistake and yes, the server should have recognized the tip amount when he/she cashed out. But there is a chance that the server did his/her report and didn't receive his/her tips in hand and therefore, didn't really care to look.\n\nEdit: I think my state law says to go by the total. You can check for sure. But all restaurants I know will ask 'what the total says' and then ultimately go with the lesser value to 'play it safe'. I understand this is r/personalfinance and people are hyperaware of finances but restaurants will generally look after customers because they cannot afford to lose you. ",

Every system is different but generally, your receipt has a reference number and has identifying details with it to help aid your server and restaurant. (Table #, order #, last 4 of credit card and issuer)\n\nYour subtotal should pop up when a server looks into the system. It's the server's job to manually enter the tip based on credit card receipts which is why it's a big deal to sign your receipts and not take them. If a cash tip is given, the tip is '0' and the total is the subtotal post tax. (Whatever the customer paid) If you don't leave a tip at all and write 20.00 as your total, your server will enter '0' as your tip. Cash tips are reported manually whereas credit tips are already in the system and if you plan on getting them, you better claim them.",

If there are humans involved there is always the possibility of human error. **I've been the guy who made the error**, although I was a retail clerk not a waiter. I charged a customer $22.50 when it should have been $2.50. Unfortunately, he discovered it before I did. From his reaction, he thought I was trying to cheat him and my employer lost his business.

I started scraping together cash to pay (asking my friends for some which was really hard to do) and I decided to take a quick gander at my checking account. This was an early time of mobile banking so there was no app, but I flagged the server and asked for a manager so I could show what had been done. Sure enough, I had a charge for about 80 dollars that had come through from Movie Tavern. In the server\u2019s haste (and darkness of the theater), I had been charged for someone else\u2019s night out.\n\nI was as nice as possible about it, but the charge had sent my account into the negative, which is why when they swiped my card for my actual bill, it didn\u2019t go through.

If you remember what day they were there they should be able to pull that receipt for you. Mine let's me search any name, check total, etc so it wouldn't matter. \n\nThe restaurant should correct the issue, they don't want a bunch of complaints through the bank. If they don't comply then talk to your bank. \n\nWhen you tell the bank you didn't spend that money, or as much money, the burden falls on the restaurant to produce a receipt in a certain time-frame. If they do not then you are refunded your money.

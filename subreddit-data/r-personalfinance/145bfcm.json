    "postText": "Between poor decisions, hours cut due to the pandemic, and just being down on our luck, my family and I have found ourselves absolutely drowning in debt and bills. On paper, we make a lot of money, but we are spending way more than we are bringing in. After taxes, health insurance, FSA, etc. we bring home a little over $7,100 monthly. Last month, we spent over $9,100. Holy shit.\n\nHere is a breakdown of our May finances:\n\n|Daycare|$2,235|\n|:-|:-|\n|Rent|$2,056|\n|Debt|$1,800|\n|Car|$1,500|\n|Groceries|$560|\n|Utilities|$341|\n|Food|$290|\n|Entertainment|$160|\n\n**Daycare** \u2013\u00a0We just put a deposit down at a daycare that is $1,450/mo and will switch in August. The current tuition is about $450/wk, and it's over 35 minutes away one way (near my husband's old job). When we were planning for our kid, MIL committed to two days a week, my husband was off one day during the week, so we initially only needed care 2 days a week. This was discussed many times throughout the pregnancy. Since I've given birth, she's only visited *maybe* once a month, never to really help out \u2013\u00a0just to see the baby. We started off with a part-time nanny that didn't work out. I tried working remotely while caring for our baby, but I felt I was neglecting both him and my job equally. Daycares in our area have a 2+ year waitlist and usually require a deposit of at least $3,000. Also, daycare was on my credit card which as of now has been maxed out and over the limit.\n\n**Car** \u2013\u00a0We used to be a one-car family ($560/mo in car payments), but right before I gave birth my husband was absolutely panicking about me not having a car for emergencies with the baby while he was at work. He worked in sales and was consistently in the top 2 salesmen, so at the time it was feasible to get a second car, albeit not the one he chose. He ended up leasing one (trust me, this was a very sore subject in our relationship for a while) and now trading it in would land us in so much negative equity. I got in an accident a couple weeks ago (not at fault), so now the value on the other financed vehicle dropped. This bucket also includes replenishment for tolls which I've now removed from autopay.\n\n**Debt** \u2013\u00a0Yep. It's a big one. We lived in a state with a slightly lower cost of living, and my husband's employment was severely affected by the pandemic. We accumulated a lot of debt. Some of this is furniture that has no interest, but a large chunk is credit card / personal loan debt meant to keep us afloat. The personal loan initially was to consolidate student loans and a much smaller credit card debt.\n\n**Groceries** \u2013 This includes baby and pet supplies. We only shop at cheaper grocery stores like Aldi.\n\n**Food** \u2013\u00a0We absolutely need to get better at just cooking. We just feel like we're hardly surviving with the sleepless nights and long workdays.\n\n**Entertainment** \u2013 Normally this is only $24 for streaming services, but we did celebrate my first Mother's Day.\n\nLike I said, I do acknowledge that a lot of this is consequences of poor decision making. In January, we had a pretty solid snowball debt payoff plan, we deleted our food delivery apps, and we really tried to cut down on spending. We don't go out and try our best to keep our spending to a minimum. Unfortunately, the economy hit car sales pretty hard and while my husband was consistently a top performer across multiple dealerships it was still not enough. He finally got a job with much better hours and consistent pay. But in the last two weeks alone, we've had to pay for bed bug treatments, emergency vet bills, and the insurance deductible from the accident (not at fault and the other party has insurance, but they went through mine first then are pursuing his? Idk it's all been a headache). And yeah, as you can guess, the credit card became the emergency fund.\n\nSo \u2013\u00a0what's the next step here? Another personal loan? Credit card balance transfer (no idea how that works)? We're trying to sell as much as we can but that's just a temporary fix.",

If you're underwater, yeah, you may have to borrow a bit more to get out of the hole, but this is not sustainable. That's 20k you're going to spend this year on car payments.\n\nYou're at the stage where you start making decisions or they start getting made for you (IE, missed car or rent payments yield reposessions or evictions).\n\nSomebody needs to take a second job while the other parent's at home to get the debt cleared.",

The best way for you to dig yourself out of this hole is for one of you to work overtime (if your job pays for OT) at your current job or to do some gig work at other times. You'll also get $800/month in relief soon with the reduced childcare expenses (and you'll free up some of your time there).\n\nIt was definitely the right decision not to split your attention between your job and parenting duties. You can do both well at separate times of the day, but not at the same time. I have the luxury of being able to work from home when the childcare is unavailable, but I can only do it during the baby's naps (and when my wife gets home from the hospital).",

It's also the going rate for our area give or take maybe $150, but anything much lower than that would be in a pretty bad area.\n\n&gt;Car : Instead of \"trading in\" : can you go back to being a one-car family.

But you have to stop adding to the debt; every month that you spend more than you bring in adds to the debt.\n\nI am looking at applying for a personal loan at a credit union vs. 0% balance transfer (Credit Karma says I have good odds of getting approved for the balance transfer but again not super familiar with how that all works). Right now the only thing adding to the debt is daycare. So if we free up debt payments then we can use cash to pay for daycare.\n\nThank you so much!",

It's at 700 which I never thought I'd see it.  \n\nIncome 143K per year (last 2 years)\n\nI have some bad debt from bad credit decisions in my past.  Not current cards...I have those all paid off and keep a low if any balance.\n\nI have a vehicle with 20K left ($562/month) 18%\nI have a vehicle with 18K left ($462/month) 14%\nI have a personal loan at 12K ($400/month) 22%\n\nI have been \"pre-qualified\" for a Home Equity loan at 8% for $50K to wipe all that high interest debt off. Payment at $400/mo. Instead of 4\n$1400+/Month.  We would certainly use the additional disposable income to pay the equity loan faster but also build a savings and take care of minor upgrades. \n\nMy home has a lot of equity, but we only needed 50K. We have $130K.  \n\nMy SNAG.\nI have a debt that is 6 months away from being past that statute of limitations (6years) and 18 months from falling off my credit. (7years)  I have fought this debt in court.  The debtor voluntarily dismissed without prejudice after my evidence was presented 4 years ago but still on my credit because instead of letting a judge make the decision and dismiss with prejudice, the creditor dropped it. It stayed put on my report with a note that I dispute it.\n\n Lender wants that paid before we close.  It's for $5000.  I really don't want to open an old debt that's almost out of my life at this point.  \n\nWhat's the best course of action here for us?",

Then spend another 6-9 months saving up for the improvements you mention.\n\nSome napkin math. A 50K loan with 8% interest paid at $400 a month is roughly a 20 year loan with 50K of interest over the life of the loan if you pay minimums.\n\nAren\u2019t HELOC\u2019s variable? If the interest rate goes up the deal gets worse.",

You didn\u2019t mention if you hired one for court but if you haven\u2019t sought counsel over this issue on your credit report they might be able to help.\n\nYour lender should also be trying to contact the credit bureau if they really want your business. I had a similar issue with settling debt and the creditor never showed the balance cleared from my report. My lender for my home loan sent all the documents to the bureau and got it removed.",

    "postText": "Folks,\n\nThis subreddit will be participating in the protest against Reddit's planned changes to its API. Communities of users, moderators, and developers have pleaded with Reddit to change course, but to no avail. We remain dedicated to our mission of helping people with their finances, but we cannot passively observe as these impending changes undermine our community and Reddit as a platform. We are compelled to take a stand, but we also want to ensure that people with time-sensitive financial questions can still find help.\n\nDuring the two-day protest which will start June 12th at 7 AM EDT:\n\n1. New submissions to the subreddit will be disabled.\n2. The [PF wiki](/r/personalfinance/wiki/index) will remain accessible, and we encourage everyone to refer to it for any questions.\n3. The weekday help thread will remain open. If your question is not urgent, please consider waiting until after the protest.\n4. We urge everyone who shares these concerns to raise them with Reddit respectfully. For more information, read the announcements on /r/Save3rdPartyApps and /r/ModCoord.\n\nWe are protesting because Reddit has failed to:\n\n1. **Dedicate sufficient time and effort to discussion and negotiation between Reddit and third-party apps, coupled with an unreasonable schedule for unreasonable changes.** We believe a solution can be found that preserves the openness of Reddit while addressing concerns about costs and control over ads in third-party apps.\n\n2. **Consider the value of Reddit users, developers, and moderators in decision-making regarding the API and third-party apps.** The significant contributions of these groups have been overlooked despite being freely provided to Reddit. We believe Reddit should continue to support third-party apps and freely-accessible external APIs to enhance community support and problem-solving capabilities.\n\n3. **Provide better support for accessibility in Reddit development.** We are concerned that without dedicated individuals and teams focusing on accessibility, it will continue to be neglected.\n\n4. **Work with developers and moderators to solve the challenges faced by communities on Reddit, especially increasing difficulties with abuse such as spam, scammers, and hate.** We oppose forcing communities into closed ecosystems that make it difficult to maintain healthy communities. The pattern of implementing detrimental changes without proper communication and consultation also needs to be halted.\n\nWe want to emphasize that this protest is driven by our subreddit and its community. We have received only respectful support for joining the broader protest in our modmail, and our moderation team has voted in favor of participating. We firmly believe that this protest is a direct result of Reddit mishandling these issues and failing to address everyone's concerns.\n\nIf you have any comments or feedback, this thread is open for comments from anyone with at least +10 subreddit comment karma.\n\nThank you for your understanding and support.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe /r/personalfinance moderation team",

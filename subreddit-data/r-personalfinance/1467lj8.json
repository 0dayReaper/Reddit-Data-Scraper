    "postText": "They are local parking tickets from the town i live in California. They sent me the collections letters this morning. Theres 2 for $75 and 1 for $94 totaling $244. All from 2022. The vehicle was totaled and taken by insurance last october so I am no longer in possession of the vehicle. \n\nShould I pay them? I feel like theres not much they can do to me now and the amount is so small that I dont think they can even add it to my credit report, but im not 100% sure. Any advice helps thanks guys. Do you think the amount will go up if I just ignore?",

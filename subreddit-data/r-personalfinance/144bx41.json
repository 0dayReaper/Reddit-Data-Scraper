    "postText": "Good morning, I was reading \"I will teach you to be rich\" by Ramit Sethi and it got me ready to take action with my debt. After reading the first chapter about credit cards, I had a clear plan in my head on how I want to tackle it but I'm unsure if it's something that will help me or hurt me, so I was hoping I could get your feedback. \n\nJust for my current financial background: \n\nI am basically teetering on my credit limit for my 1 credit card at 7K and I have just a few hundred owed on my other at a limit of $1,500. I also have private student loan's that I got down to about 39K. I was also thinking of going back to school which would ultimately add to my debt.....but I want to decimate my credit card debt once and for all.\n\nMy Idea:\n\nI called my loan financer and found out that I am allowed 48 months of deferment once I get approved in order to go to school. To my understanding, I also get about 12 months of deferment if I come into financial hardships. Before I start the process of getting school stuff together, I was thinking of calling to defer my loans temporarily for a few months so that I can dump all money towards my credit cards. Once done, I want to resume my student loans and start dumping all my money to my student loans. I understand that I need to get my mentality straight about how I think about money or else my credit card debt will come back and I am already making strides to correcting my bad behavior.   \nConclusion:\n\nI am itching to implement this right away but I figured I would pick the brains of people who are smarter than me to see if this an actual viable option or if this is a fruitless attempt. What are your thoughts on this? Thank you for your time :)",

            "comment": "If you can get a deferment, it\u2019s probably not a bad idea because the cc interest is almost certainly higher than the student loan interest, just be aware that those student loans will probably still be accruing interest while deferred. So you\u2019ll be coming back to a bigger balance on them than before.\n\nStill, it\u2019s probably a good way to free up some money each month by paying off the cards so that you can come back and hit the student loans with everything that you\u2019d normally be paying toward them + what you would pay toward the cards.",

    "postText": "I'm attempting to recharacterize my 2023 contributions so far to a Vanguard Roth IRA due to expected AGI increases this year.\n\nI found the process on the Vanguard site for completing a recharacterization, and it asks you which assets you want to recharacterize from. I have a single TDF, so I choose that, and enter a dollar amount equal to my 2023 contributions so far.\n\nIt seems to indicate it will \"transfer in kind\":\n\n&gt;*All recharacterizations will be completed in kind. You can reallocate your investments once the recharacterization is complete.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;*Important: Your recharacterized assets will be transferred in kind to the receiving IRA.*  \n&gt;  \n&gt;*Shares from your brokerage account settlement fund will be liquidated and transferred in cash.*\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know we're trying to avoid any earnings on this money while it moves back to Traditional until I do the Convert to Roth step.\n\nIf these assets transfer in-kind, the market is going to open the next day and do *something*, so I may have gains here. Again I understand we're trying to avoid this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, would it be better for me to sell that much in TDF holdings first so that's available in the cash settlement fund, then select the cash settlement fund as the source for the recharacterization?",

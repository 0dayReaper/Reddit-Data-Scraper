    "postText": "Single. \n\nIncome: ~$170k/yr\n\nDebt (includes mortgage): $2000/month \n\n401k: $80k in target retirement date fund. I contribute about 20% of my paycheck. Employer match is 3%. Effectively maxing out the allocation. \n\nSavings: About $7k in my checking account. No other real liquidity outside of these funds. \n\nI feel like I'm too low on cash and always stretched thin because of my large 401k allocation. Good news is I own my house and have very low mortgage payments since the loan amount is quite low. I would likely want to save for another down-payment and buy a house in the 450-500k range. What can I do to reach this goal?\n\nEdit:\n\nInvestments: \n\n$2500 in equities. I contribute $150 everyday to my recurring investment. \n\n$2000 in crypto. $150/week recurring investment.",

In your position, I would dial back the retirement contributions and build up a good solid 6 months of savings in an HYSA, more if you're looking to buy a house. I would not be putting one nickel into crypto.",

I personally don't endorse crypto, but that's just me.\n\n- We have no indication of your spending otherwise, such as food, hobbies, other cost of living, etc.\n\nBut most importantly, you're in a great place. Even if we assume the worst case scenario in every facet, your income is seemingly able to comfortably garnish your investments, debt, and living, and future new house. Definitely still be smart with your money, but as boring as it sounds, I think you've just hit a point where it's time to grind the wealth accumulation until you're ready to retire.",

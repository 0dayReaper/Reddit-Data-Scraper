    "postText": "many employers try to motivate or manage employees with non monetary factors like telling you the work you do is \"meaningful\" but if you're in a job where you're really only in it for the money (say, you're an analyst of some sort or a project manager or an in-house counsel) , should you be transparent about this? I mean, if I wanted \"meaningful work\" , I'd be in nursing or video games development. \n\nbeing transparent may help signal to your employer that they should give better increments but I have a vague sense that it helps everybody to maintain the charade that we can be motivated by things other than money. I just can't quite articulate why. any thoughts?",

You can probably get away with this when you're in college working a part-time retail job, but employers expect you to take your job seriously as you get older.\n\nThey will see that you aren't motivated to perform your job well. Sure, many people get their jobs for monetary gain, but I've seen more people get fired for admitting they hated their job or were only there for the money in my career for technology. They're usually the easiest to let go or to be laid off first, because they're sometimes the laziest employees. \n\nEdit: Taking a job just for the money without liking the environment, coworkers, your responsibilities, or what you're doing is a quick way to burn out.\n\nIf you're not happy with your job, you're not working in the right role. You need to try another type of role at the same company that fits you better by talking about that to your employer. Or just find another job.",

The only things that would truly motivate me are either more money or more time off. \n\nThen again I'm really good at my job and it is a very specialized field. Those afford me the luxury of not having to sugar coat it at all. I also have 0 desire to be in a managerial position so it helps if they know I'm not a pep talker.",

(although you might think that this obviously tells him/her very clearly what you want)\n\nYou have to find a way to politely (and somewhat obliquely) communicate that you need to feel rewarded while doing rewarding work.   \n\nIf you communicate a pure money motivation in an industry where the employer does not have the ability to incentivize you directly and frequently through money, they will take your outright admission of money motivation to be a sign that you will jump ship at any opportunity where someone else pays you more.",

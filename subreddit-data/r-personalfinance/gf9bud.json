    "postText": "I see pet ownership discussed here a good bit. As someone who loves animals, I understand the reasoning for wanting a pet. I also understand the work and funds it takes to appropriately take care of a pet. Here are the direct costs (6.75% tax included) that I paid from May 5th 2019 - May 5th 2020\n\nFood/Treats:  $672\n\nVet/meds: $488 (everything routine outside of allergic reaction with bees)\n\nToys: $136\n\nBoarding: $465\n\nAir Conditioning Cord she chewed: $220\n\nPet insurance: $420\n\n**Total: $2,401 or $200/mo**\n\nI love my dog. She is an amazing companion, she is the protector of my wife and daughter when I am away, she is just an amazing animal. I am in a spot where I can afford to have and enjoy her. Some of these expenses will fluctuate over time, however when people say a dog is a car payment, they are right. Some years it'll be a used civic payment, other years it can be a new BMW payment or higher. Make a sound financial decision for you, your family, and the animal.\n\nedit: I do all grooming myself",

We have two cats, one never scratched the furniture and constantly used the poles, the other always went for the top of the couch arms but I never saw use poles. One day I had the ah-hah moment and realized that cat who used our couch liked scratching the couch while standing on top of it and scratching underneath herself, which is a totally different pose from standing upright and scratching a pole. Bought her a flat cardboard scratcher and almost over night she took to it. We still can't get her entirely off the couch, but it's dropped by 90%. So I think some cats like a different pose/angle when they go for a scratch and you need a toy to suit it.",

Figured if I could find a half and half mix I would get a large gentle loving newfy with the health of a husky. Two years later I realized I suck at genetics because I got a very large oaf that drools, destroys, sheds and talks back every chance he gets. I will say that he is great with children though and gentle as could be",

When I was a vet tech we saw a Great Dane in kidney failure from eating grapes he got into and had an elderly client with a small dog who fed it grapes regularly (we could not persuade her to stop, we tried every time they came in) and it was fine. \n\nBecause of this vets recommend that any dog who eats any number of grapes or raisins be made to vomit or hospitalized on IV fluids for a day or two to protect their kidneys.\n\nOn the subject of people foods dogs can\u2019t eat, onions and garlic are also bad for dogs and cats because they can cause anemia.\n\nEdit: finished a sentence",

It was very difficult for us to find a place that would accept a big dog when we were moving.

Plus our dog has a vendetta against carpets so we had to find somewhere with hard wood. I don\u2019t regret getting her at all and to me it\u2019s worth it, but we had to pass up on a lot of really great places because we wanted her to have a good quality of life.

For now though, my hedgehog is a perfect apartment pet. I don't have to walk him outside to go to the bathroom, he's quiet, pretty low-maintenance and cheap to feed, and most apartments consider them \"small pets\" that don't require any kind of special deposit or pet rent.

So for my roommates' sake that means I take a walk every morning at 6am. In the colder months she gets another 30 min run later in the day. She is chill for the entire day after that walk. My point is there's a lot of physical responsibility for certain breeds outside of the $$ responsibility. I have been fortunate where she is very affordable but requires a large amount of time in the way of daily exercise.",

I love my dogs, but they are definitely a lot of work compared to most breeds and the amount of people that buy them based purely off their looks infuriates me. I have two, and I will say having 2 makes it easier for me, since I have a yard they can run around in together haha. The amount of hair I\u2019m cleaning every few days is ridiculous. Luckily during the summer months it doesn\u2019t take long to tire them out. And during the winter they go on runs with me up to 15 miles. A high velocity dryer was also the greatest investment for blowing out their coats! When people inquire about my dogs and I discuss the amount of a work a husky takes, most seem to change their mind pretty quick lol. I wouldn\u2019t trade them for anything though. I couldn\u2019t imagine having another breed at this point \ud83d\ude43",

With my health issues and work commitments that just isn't going to happen every single day. Instead i typically get Mastiff mixes.

When she cant find her toys shes chewing on boxes and ripping up and down the side of the computer chair that she has totally destroyed. \n\nThis is my first kitten,  I adopted the other 2 when they were about 3-4. I knew she was going to be active but I really didnt realize what tyrant she was going to be.\n\nThat being said my kitten experience has been a thousand times easier and less destructive than with puppies.

They really can be a very low maintenance pet.\n\nOn the other hand, my brother's cats are like having human toddlers. You have to constantly prevent them from breaking the house or killing themselves and they want constant attention. Even just trying to sleep at night, they're crying at the door because they know you're in there and want to see you. We've had to babysit them a few times when he's gone on trips and it is quite stressful.\n\nSo it can definitely run the spectrum.",

However, my wife works for a specialist veterinary hospital and the stories I hear...  There are too many people that have pets that are disposable.  Many times it's because they haven't been properly cared for, have never received checkups or teeth cleanings, etc.  Or, they've had their health deteriorate over time because the owner didn't want to spend any money on the animal.  My main point was own a pet responsibly.  Don't get a pet if you're not prepared to care for it.  I honestly do appreciate your comment, though.  I am an animal lover and tend to get a little too passionate when people aren't as screwy as me.  You're absolutely right.  There are exceptions.",

A friend of mine lived on the fourth floor of an apartment building where it was probably a 5 minute walk just to get outside. \n\nHer roommate bought a puppy, a larger breed. Not only is the dog stuck in their 600 square foot apartment all day when she's gone, but the roommate won't even take it outside to use the bathroom. \n\nInstead, she bought one of those \"puppy mats\" and keeps it on their tiny balcony so the dog can use the bathroom. When she's not home, it just goes on the floor. \n\nMy friend even called the shelter she got the dog from and they refused to do anything about it. \n\nIt infuriates me to no end that she could be so inconsiderate and irresponsible. If you're going to buy an animal, please, please, also consider the animal in that decision.",

The first we paid over $10k in six months because no dog insurance. The next two both had insurance with 90% reimbursement rates, and have saved us $25k ALREADY.  One dog passed , but the remaining one has a $450/month injection covered 90% by insurance, already had two ACLs fixed plus physical therapy (8000 combined)  and --as of this week-- a new bone cancer diagnosis. This will run 5-10k to treat, regardless of which modality we decide on. Our total insurance deductible for that dog is $1500/year. Insurance will have easily paid out 5x more than our deductibles over the like of the dog. It is amazing not having to think about whether a treatment or procedure can be afforded, and only considering what is best for the dog. I'll never have a dog without insurance again.\n\nEdited to add: another nice feature is that many vets can direct bill the insurance policy, so you don't even have to front the $5-10k for surgery, you just pay your 10% copay and move on.  One of the surgery centers we use has a full-time insurance coordinator on staff!",

Disc removal by specialist dog neurologist, followed by house spider bite that caused necrosis of the arm. She died on the table during debridement at 3 years old.  Second dog was an Eskland , developed intestinal cancer AND and auto-immune disease at the same time (8 years old) that caused his body to attack his own red blood cells, starving him of oxygen (all work performed in Atlanta, insured).   Third dog is a Saint Bernard that's about to turn 7. ACL torn and then miniscus tear in same leg several months apart. 10 physical therapy sessions, cold laser,   underwater treadmill at a dedicated dog rehab facility in Atlanta. Three years later this same dog now has a diagnosis of osteosarcoma as of this week.  Can the local vet amputate a limb with good results? Probably. But when there's a certified canine orthopedic surgeon available at another specialty facility within driving distance that costs more than the local vet, I'm going to the specialist every time, especially with an  insurance company that always pays. My poor dogs really have been unlucky, and we've gotten them from incredibly reputable breeders.",

I have a $500 deductible and after that they pay back 90% of the cost associated with care. Like if my dog got cancer and required $10,000 worth of surgery or whatever. I would pay a small portion between the deductible and 10%. This is basically so I wouldn't have to drain our efund. As much as I love the dog, if something happened and we didn't have the insurance I don't think I could justify coming out of pocket an insane amount to save her. I can justify the insurance.",

It is for emergencies and accidents only, so all of our regular vet appts (about $260/year for all 3 of my pets) and preventative meds for our dog (about $200) are out of pocket, which is fine.\n\nMy husband got injured and we STUPIDLY left out a bottle of ibuprofen, and my dog ate 27 of the 600 mg tablets while we were out of the house for 45 mins. The vet bills were $6300. We have a $500 deductible with 80% reimbursement, and we got back around $4600 after we submitted everything. We have submitted smaller claims in the past that have always gone towards the deductible. I will NEVER not have pet insurance, it is so worth it. We obviously weren't anticipating that emergency and we could give her everything she needed without going in to debt. Every pet owner should have a policy. We pay $20/per cat and $25 for my dog, so only $65 per month. It's already more than paid for itself. I am also very pleased with their customer service.",

If it's not for \"you\" (you being anyone reading this), I totally understand that everyone has their own risk model, but 100% I have \"made money\" on all my pet insurance policies, even the ones I have paid for the pets since they were itty bitties. Some people will say, \"well I just put the money aside and have it in savings,\" and that is great but chemo isn't the $6k you'd put away in savings over a 10yr lifespan of a dog - it's like $30K+ if you actually do enough to extend the dog's quality of life. \n\nDo you have a dog with a penchant for eating socks? That's a $500 ultra sound to confirm whether the intestines can pass it properly every time they make a poor eating choice - probably once a year? - , and that is before any other tests or emergency vet bills and on top of general annual care.\n\nIt's also SO NICE to be able to just be like \"yeah, run the extra blood panel to be sure everything is ok\" because it ONLY COSTS ME $8 on top of the monthly bill I already pay, so it just liberates us to really up the quality of vet care. Also, there's the intrinsic benefit that vets love us because they can really practice good medicine without feeling like it's ruining our bank account.\n\nWe have a debatably crazy number of fur kids (5), and all but one has pet insurance. and I have 0 regret about that monthly bill because it has come in handy for all of them, less the accidental kitten we have had for less than a month lol and that's more because he hasn't had time to do anything dumb. lololol\n\nPS - the one doesn't have insurance b/c he is our oldest kitty and has cerebellar hypoplasia and a host of other established issues, so when pet insurance became a thing he was way beyond getting coverage, lol. I wish we had it for him though!",

So many people think they can afford to have a dog because they can afford the food, which is just flat-out untrue. \n\nAnother scenario to think about is when (not if, when) your animal(s) start to have health problems or become ill. Last year, both my parrot and one of my two dogs had a tumor. Both animals needed surgery to remove the tumor, follow-up care, and my dog needed cancer treatment and medications. Last year, just these services cost me more than $4,000 out of pocket, in addition to the day-to-day costs you mention above. \n\nMy animals are too old for vet insurance, so that wasn't an option either, and vet insurance wasn't really much of a thing when I got them over 10 years ago. When you make a commitment to an animal, that also includes when they are sick and old. And it is your responsibility to provide them with needed medical care, so long as their prognosis and quality of life support the procedures/medications/treatments. \n\nI know people who couldn't have afforded the bills and would have put both animals down. I am happy to report that both my bird and my dog are doing well. Their quality of life is the same as before and they are symptom-free for the past year+.",

It's not meant to pay every cent of every medical related expense that you have.\n\nThink of how your car insurance does not pay for most car repairs or maintenance...\n\nThe same is true there.",

            "comment": "For anyone considering getting a dog, be aware of what the OFA is, and what proper health testing is (not just \u201cthis dog was checked by a vet\u201d, there are specific tests recommended for each breed, and results are posted in a publicly available database). Dogs who complete recommended health testing are given a CHIC number. \n\nBuying a dog from a breeder doing this gives you less likelihood of spending a fortune on vet bills down the road. Take hip dysplasia for instance\u2014if you know that for 5 generations back the parents of your dog have had excellent hip x rays, your chances of a dog with hip dysplasia are low. While some will argue shelter dogs are healthier, things like hip dysplasia are common in a lot of breeds, and no one is checking shelter dog parents for these things. You might spend more up front to get a dog with health tested parents, but you will likely save in the long run. That being said, responsible rescue is excellent as well, just consider pet insurance if you don\u2019t know the dogs background.\n\n[Here is a guide ](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/wiki/identifying_a_responsible_breeder?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app) to identifying a responsible breeder.\n\nAnd [here](https://www.ofa.org/browse-by-breed) is where you can see the recommended tests for each breed. \n\nAlso, if you want to save money, I highly recommend avoiding getting into dog sports...",

We do crystal litter which is pricey but we like it better and we get some of the higher tier foods (FROMM and Royal Canin). We also have have to get Lysine and Cosequin as they are seniors and that stuff costs a fortune.\n\nWe also do a water fountain dish which needs regular filter replacement and calming collars (helpful with multiple cats) so those do run up the price a bit. \n\nThe vet visits for seniors really add up, they get regular teeth cleaning, 2 checkups and multiple urinalysis and blood tests each year. We use Banfield so the costs are predictable each month but its still costly.",

So when I file a schedule C, is there some threshold I need to cross in order to itemize? Or is the standard deduction only applicable to certain schedules (A for example). Cause I only make maybe 4k a year atm, it's a small side business. \n\nAlso, if you have a regular job too and file a 1040 anyways, can you combine that amount, and your gross amount via side job and deduct expenses on schedule C after? Or is it not combinable into one form?",

Income for Form 1040 comes in many different forms...W2 jobs, interest/dividends, capital gains/losses, self-employment business profit/loss.  You file one Form 1040 with various schedules on where your income comes from, and that provide IRS the details they need to understand your income-earning activities.\n\n**As a business**, you calculate income as gross sales less expenses (postage, supplies, your shelves, etc.).  There is no threshold, and there's no concept of itemizing.  You can only deduct business expenses on Schedule C.  This is reported as income by completing Schedule C, and the net side gig profit from that schedule ends up flowing onto Schedule 1, Line 3 and then ultimately into taxable income on Form 1040, Line 8.  \n\n**As an individual**, you report W2 income on Line 1a of Form 1040.  You still get to exempt from income the greater of your itemized deductions (total from Schedule A) or the standard exemption.  Schedule A deductions apply to you as an individual, and includes things like property taxes, mortgage interest, charitable gifts, etc.",

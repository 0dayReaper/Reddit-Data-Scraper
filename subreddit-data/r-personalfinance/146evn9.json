    "postText": "I cannot find the answer to this question. I have $300,000 parked in a cash reserve Vanguard Federal Money Market Account, probably until next Spring. Earrnings are paid monthly. Is this fund similar to a mutual fund where I become liable for Federal Income tax when I take a distribution, or will I be hit with a tax bill for 2023 on the earnings even if I do not withdraw themin 2023? Thanks!",

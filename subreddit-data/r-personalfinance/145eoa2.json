    "postText": "Hello everyone, looking for advice as I'm starting dental school with a financial terrible position. I have  6K in CC debt (1500 on discover IT, 0% for 15 months) (4200 on BoA cash rewards). Currently at 681 FICO and I'd like to maintain this or increase it during my 4 years in dental school so it's easier for me to secure any loans I may need afterwards. \n\nI'm going to be taking out extra loans my first year just to pay off the 4200 on the cash rewards card this August since the interest has been brutal and I'll be making minimum payments on the discover card until the intro APR ends and then I'll pay whatever is left the following year.\n\nCurrently have 3 credit cards. I've paid the highest interest one through discover and closed that one, I've also paid off my chase freedom card but haven't closed it yet. Debating on whether I should or not. Also should I close my cash rewards card after I pay it off? Or would this hurt me? I figure, I can't build or maintain this credit score without any credit cards, but I'm not too fond of using them after all this. \n\nAny suggestions? I can always keep one open with the best rewards and get gas/food on it and pay it off monthly. Is that my best bet? \n\nSorry for the long ass post, thanks everyone.",

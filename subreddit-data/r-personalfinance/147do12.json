For context I currently have almost none, I am a Uni student (Highschool Teacher) in 18 months my salary will be 55k US a year. \n\nI live in Australia but i converted the likely figures that I might receive into US dollars. Also I have no issues around affording rent (share house), a good car, no debts.\n\nWhat would you do if you received each of these, in my position.",

    "postText": "Hi,\n\nI recently bought my first car at the end of 2022. I have been insured under my parents as a secondary driver for their cars since I was first licensed at 16, but I started my own insurance plan after the car purchase. I tried getting quotes at all of the major insurance companies, but only Geico and State Farm were able to give me a quote (auto+renters). Both drivers are clean drivers, no accidents or traffic violations.\n\nResidence: \n\n* Queens, NY\n\nDrivers:\n\n* Primary: 25M\n* Fiance: 25F\n\nCar: \n\n* 2023 BMW M3 xDrive Competition\n\nCurrent State Farm insurance:\n\n* $427/month\n   * Increased from $380/month after first 6 months.\n* 300k/300k coverage\n\nGeico Quote:\n\n* $690/month\n* Similar coverage\n\nI'm not sure what is causing my rates to be so high, besides the fact the car is expensive. I don't mind paying extra, but other owners of this vehicle have much lower rates. I assume they are married/homeowners, which lead to lower rates. My employer has discounts with Travelers, Farmers, and Liberty Mutual, but they don't insure my vehicle.\n\n* Do others in a similar situation pay comparable rates?\n* Anything actionable to get lower rates?\n\nFeedback appreciated, thank you.",

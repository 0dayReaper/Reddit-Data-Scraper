    "postText": "I live in ILLINOIS, So recently I just got fired for a very stupid reason at my job. I have a 2014 Chevy Cruze LS that I still owe $10,000 on. I bought the car for $15,000 in November 2022, with a 17% APR (I\u2019m 21 male), insurances want to charge me over $250 a month for full coverage never been in an accident, I lost my job and I cannot afford this. I was pulled over a month ago for not having insurance so I have until June 15th to make a decision on what should I do before I pay for insurance or just sell it. I was offered by my brother in law $4000 to buy my car ( could talk him up to give $5000 instead) and he\u2019ll take over the car note. I have a car my dad could\u2019ve sold me for $2,000 it\u2019s a Saturn so I could potentially buy it. What should I do please let me know smart options on what I should do ?l",

It's the bank's car, and you can't sell a car you don't own.\n\nAny deal you try to make selling or trading this vehicle has to pay off the loan in full before the bank will release the title.\n\nWhat you need to do is get a job and pay your bills, and not drive the car until you get insurance, which you need to reinstate ASAP.\n\nThe bank can and will repossess the car the moment they find out you've been driving **their car** around uninsured.",

Usually not.\n\nWhen you buy a GM vehicle it is usually financed through GMAC - a bank that has little to do with GM and nothing to do with a dealership.\n\nI would reject the BIL offer. Right now dealerships are looking for well-maintained used cars. If this is the route you are thinking of going I would talk to a dealership about buying your (technically the bank's) car. You would have to pay the bank the difference.\n\n17% - is this for real?!? Did you mean 7% (which is still high)?",

I would shop the rate to see if anyone can offer something better. \n\nSo let\u2019s say all in you\u2019re at $700/m high but not crazy. It\u2019s better to keep the note and it it off at least as far as your credit is concerned. Btw I\u2019m amazed the bank financing car hasn\u2019t harassed you for no insurance. \n\nSelling to someone and letting them keep paying the note is risky. Because if they stop paying, it they wreck the car etc, it\u2019s all on you",

Next go find a job as soon as you can. But if you don\u2019t have that much saved up and you really want to get rid of it then by all means sell it it to your brother in law. If that\u2019s the case He would need to get a loan from a bank or credit union. His lender or you can get a payoff quote from your lender. Then his lender payoffs your lender which can take up to 30 days so you would still be responsible for the car payment until the loan is payed off/ transferred of ownership. i did it with my old car. I owed like 8k on it. Car max bought it for 6k, so I had negative equity. I put up the 2k to finish paying off the loan. I believe it took about 3 weeks to clear on my wells Fargo account. it also depends how much your brother in law lender is willing to loan him for the car. if you have negative equity then you will have to put the rest to finish the loan. Ex. You\u2019re wanting to sell your financed car for 13k because that\u2019s how much you owe hypothetically. His lender will only loan him 10k then you would have to put up the 3k to finish the loan. but I\u2019m positive you can go find a job soon just talk with your lender and work something out. You want to avoid repossession at all costs. My brother went through that.",

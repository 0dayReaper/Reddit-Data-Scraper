    "postText": "I just got a new job and I'm trying to decide which plan would be better. This is my first time enrolling in my own medical insurance, so I'm not sure which one to choose. I have a herniated disc in my neck so I would like to see chiropractors and get physical therapy a few times a year. The details of the plans are as follows:\n\nPPO\n\nDeductible: 500/in; 2000/out\n\nOut of Pocket: 1500/in; 6000/out\n\nCo-insurance: 20%/in; 50%/ out\n\nSemi-monthly contribution: 177.50\n\n\nHDHP\n\nDeductible: 3000/in; 6000/out\n\nOut of Pocket: 4000/12500\n\nCo-insurance: 0%/in; 30%/out\n\nSemi-monthly contribution: 217",

If yes, the HDHP will cost you more money before you even incur any health care expenses, and you'll pay a much higher deductible. The only real benefit would be access to a HSA, but at the cost of paying more.",

It's an awesome retirement savings vehicle:  untaxed going in, grows tax free, untaxed coming out.\n\nI pay all my expenses directly and let my HSA grow.  I save all the receipts and will start turning them in during retirement for income.",

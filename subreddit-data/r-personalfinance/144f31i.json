    "postText": "I'm in a desperate situation after making a number of poor decisions in unfortunate circumstances. I was doing the best I could with what I had to work with, but now I have to handle the fallout. I do not have any safety nets, anyone to fall back on, and I do not qualify for any assistance programs I can find so I'm just hoping someone here will know something I don't.  I make right around $40k at my current day job, and I'm looking for a second job. Net income is $1,015 bi-weekly. My spouse just graduated and is doing gigs here and there while applying for any position hiring. \n\nI have an unfinished home with no electric, plumbing, insulation, heat/AC (not really safe to live in) with a revolving line of credit construction loan. The payment on the construction loan (interest only) is about $700/mo. right now. I have two used cars with upside down loans and a total payment of $950/mo. with $370/mo. insurance. I rent an office I had to get when my employer moved us to remote short notice and I couldn't get adequate internet where I was living. The office rent is $787/mo. and the contract states the total contract amount must be paid in full in the event of early termination.  I have a phone bill of $121.22/mo. for two lines, and I can probably cut that in half downgrading my service. We have about $4,000 in credit card debt, and about $26k in federal student loan debt. And I just took a $1k loan from my 401(k) so that I could make ends meet for one more month while I try to find a way to recover. In addition to this there are a few pet expenses, gas from gigs/job hunting, and enough groceries to get by. There is no current housing expense listed as we are, for all intents and purposes, homeless at this point. \n\nWith al of that being said I do currently have decent credit. I have a 730 credit score and I have never missed a payment. My parents were obsessed with Dave Ramsey so I did not learn a lot about responsible debt, but I did learn not to miss a payment and I have always managed to do whatever it took (within the law) to make ends meet. I'm jut at a loss for what to do to limit the fallout here other than hoping we each have 2 jobs within the week in this job market.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Currently homeless with a large amount of upside down secured debts and a negative cashflow. What options do I have to mitigate the losses?",

I could probably sell it in a few months at what I paid for it and take a $40k loss. I'm pursuing a case against an unlicensed contractor for ~$40k, but that could take years to get sorted out if we even get paid.",

It seems petty dire.. but it's good that you and your spouse are looking for gigs and jobs\n\nI'd call car insurance companies in your area to compare costs, (make sure the coverage is the same so you're not comparing apples to oranges). Possibly consider a higher deductible to see how much you can save. If you and your spouse don't have a lot of assets, and depending on your risk tolerance, maybe consider bare minimum auto insurance that meets the car loan requirements for the time being. Bear in mind that can be financially risky if a collision happens\n\nAre there any paid house-sitting /pet sitting gigs in your area that you might be able to take on?",

I had a lower car insurance rate and the same coverage with another local company until the car was totalled in a flood and they dropped us. This was the next cheapest option with a company I trusted. I don't think I can handle the risk of lowering coverage at this time as everything seems to be going just absolutely wrong. Minimum card payments are $70, $71, and $40.\nFood is mostly food pantry, and Soylent and a few fast food gift cards I've had laying around.",

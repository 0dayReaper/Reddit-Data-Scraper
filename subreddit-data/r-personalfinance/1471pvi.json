    "postText": "I want to pay my house off in 10 years. The loan originated in 2006 at $57,000, and refinanced in 2012 around $55,000. In 2022, loan balance is right back up to $55,000+ with the covid repayment plan. I want to be done with them asap. Loan maturity date is now 2063. Still hoping it's discovered in the next few years that this is illegal, but anyway...\n\nI have recently started paying $300 extra toward principle each month, but maybe savings makes more sense. The loan rate is 3.875, and current balance is about $53,800. I'm thinking at the very least I'll break even on interest, allowing me to pay off with a lump sum in 10 years. Also, having money available in an emergency would be nice. \n\nI am currently renting the house to short term contract workers, so right now that's taking care of the mortgage payment and a little cushion if anything needs repair. I am a traveling musician with a poverty level income and just a grand in the bank, so I want to do the right thing with any extra. It's hard to say if $300/month is sustainable, so it's made me feel like I'm at least accomplishing something seeing the loan balance go down. Routine deposits into a savings account would probably be the best route, but only if I can guarantee the routine. Just kill me if I'm still paying on this mortgage at 80+ years old.\n\nObviously an emergency fund should be priority, but I also just wanted to see if a few bits of wisdom/advice come out of this that I wouldn't have considered. Thanks!",

This is especially important on a rental. \n\nYour top priority should be an emergency fund then a home repair fund. \n\nSomeone can probably chime in on conventional wisdom for rental properties - x months of mortgage payments, lawyer fees, etc. You're playing with fire without those safeguards.",

Doesn't sound like much, but unless there's a catastrophe that insurance *should* cover, I don't anticipate anything going horribly wrong. Also have a credit card just in case. I also don't anticipate issues with the tenants, who have background checks done 4 times a year, and only 3 month leases. I rent this way #1 to avoid the hassle that can easily come with long-term tenants (experience from years ago), and #2 so that we can have our furnished home with utilities already set up to come back to if we want/need.",

Did I read it correctly, $56,000 for 40 years at 3.875%? Over pay principal, when you can. It shouldn't be hard to get that paid off in less than 10 years -- especially since your earning potential should, in theory, increase with time. 3.875% isn't expense, even if you can't do it in 10.",

Sorry, I obviously don\u2019t know much about the industry in general and especially *your* niche inside of it\n\nBut increasing your income should be top priority in my opinion. More firepower makes it all easier. And if extra hours means extra money, well, you\u2019re not getting any younger\n\nYou\u2019re at 57 total years on a $57k mortgage. Knock that thing out of here. At the rate you\u2019re currently going, a couple hours per night every other day doing rideshare or delivery would mark a significant improvement\n\nBuild a legit emergency fund first and then you can really throw every extra penny at the mortgage without fear of running out. If paying off the mortgage is what you want to do. Even HYSAs are offering more than your current rate, however",

I, personally, wouldn't even invite the complication into my life. Let's say you're getting 4.5%, and your fed+state taxes are 15%, that leaves you with 3.825% interest after taxes... less than if you'd just paid toward the mortgage. A lot of financial maneuvers that are generally a good idea, are just not worthwhile once you factor in taxes. Many people \\*don't\\* remember to factor in taxes, or do it incorrectly.",

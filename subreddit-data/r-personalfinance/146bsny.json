Transfer balance from one of the credit card with highest APR which is $4K\n2. Pay minimum balance every month on the credit card and the rest goes to citi simplicity.\n3. after paying off city simpliticy, will transfer balance the next high APR debt and follow #2 until promo expire and apply for a new transfer balance card.\n4. I already disabled all my credit card and cut down all vacations and expenses as much I can.  Wife doesn't know I carry these debt.\n\nWould you think this is a good approach for the moment?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "\\#3 read terms: usually it says \"0% APR for X months on balances transferred within 30/60/90 days\"\n\nNo big deal, just apply for new card at that time. Actually you could try now for 2nd bank ASAP before citi new account shows on credit report. Don't close accounts, keep them $0 balance that will help with credit scores and options as you continue your journey.\n\n\\#2 do apposite, pay most to cards with interest and take advantage of your 0% APR.\n\nEvery $100 you pay you your 0% APR saves you $0 in interest while every $100 to your 25% balance saves you $2 a month in interest. Next month your interest and minimum payment is $2 less, but if you ignore that and keep paying more that is how you solve your debt issue.",

That's what gets you",

In 18 months you'll be in the clear and good to go again. Don't sweat it you can handle this. But stop doing stuff on the slide and lying to your wife. That's not cool",

Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors.",

    "postText": "I looked in the post history and see some helpful posts but my brain needs a clear plan in order to function. I want to stop using my debit card for everything and start using credit cards in order to reap the benefits. Currently, we have $3500 across all credit cards (had a few bigger purchases recently, this is not our normal spending pattern). I understand I have to pay these off first or else I will be accruing interest rates out the wazoo. The plan I was thinking was:\n\n1. Pay off balances on cards\n2. Review benefits for each card (i.e. if one has the most cash back for gas, use that card for gas)\n3. Use cards for every day purchases\n4. Pay off balance in full every month\n\nDoes this sound reasonable? Things like our mortgage are debited right out of our bank (our mortgage lender is our credit union) so obviously that wouldn't be on a card. But should I pay our utilities on cards too? Right now all of our monthly bills are on auto-draft. Do I start by just using credit cards for gas, groceries, etc.?\n\nAppreciate any help or suggestions!\n\nETA: Thanks everyone for the input! This is super helpful in helping me make a plan. Currently I am focused on paying down our balances so we don't wind up in this position again in the future. Then I'd like to ideally be using our credit cards for more everyday purchases and paying it off frequently! ",

You can either throw the entire rebate each month towards your balance or you can let the points build until you use them towards a moderate/larger purchase that you wouldn't have gotten otherwise but either way, it's effectively still savings. Looking at it as \"free money\" is exactly what credit card companies want you to do. They want you to develop a mindset of \"if I spend more, I get more points which equal more money\" and hope that it results in higher balances that you can't feasibly pay off entirely each month and they can start charging interest on the remainder.",

And this way, the 1% does reduce the monthly bill even just a little bit. What's important is to stick to the regular expenses and not be blinded by cashback.",

Thanks for the info!\n\nI'd instead encourage you to set up a High Yield savings account that you consider to be \"already spent\" money... That way you can earn up to 45 days of interest on the same money for \"free.\"\n\nIf you average a monthly bill of $2,000, and the interest rate is 3% - that is an additional $30/year you can make in interest! (I divided $2,000 /2 for \"average daily balance\" for my calculation - and only calculated simple interest to simplify this example)",

There\u2019s a big misunderstanding that one needs to pay off their balance in full each month (\u201cdon\u2019t carry a balance\u201d), but in reality one only needs to pay of the STATEMENT balance (charges from previous cycle) in full each month. This is confusing and may look wrong/make one think they\u2019ll have to pay interest, but you won\u2019t. It\u2019s kinda similar to paying a utility bill. For example, when you pay for May electric usage on June 15th (arbitrary date chosen), you\u2019ve already started accruing usage for the month of June, but you don\u2019t need to pay it immediately. You only pay for the previous \u201ccycle\u201d which is the May balance. Then once July comes along, you\u2019re only paying for June. In a sense, you always owe SOMETHING. This is why when you move you end up with partial bills to pay off.\n\nI really enjoy using YNAB because it helps visualize setting money aside for full credit card balance making the actual number in my checking account irrelevant.",

With no use at all, from time to time they will close your card out if it isn't being used.  But as long as you are using it occasionally, it's unlikely to get closed.  \n\nAnd $0 balance when they report doesn't hurt you.  If it's a brand new card, I'd wait until a statement comes out showing a balance, at least once, because otherwise I'm not sure the credit rating companies get it into their system, but once it is there, you don't need to worry.",

Luckily I don\u2019t keep much more than to pay my bills in there and have most in savings, but still hurt while I waited to get a new card and everything figured out. Took about a week to get access to my money.

My debit card never gets used other than the occasional atm withdrawal and never online. \n\nWorks well for me, but I am very fiscally responsible.

If you are spending every day on your card, your balance will never go to $0 even if you pay the full amount every month. The balance you owe to \"pay in full\" and not get charged interest is whatever you spent the previous month. However that amount stays on your balance until the due date on top of what you're spending this month. That might not align with the day your balance gets reported to credit agencies.\nThis is why some folks are recommending paying it off weekly to keep the overall and high watermark balances low to make it look better on a credit report. \nMy credit report shows I owe a few thousand on a card, but I've been paying it off every month and haven't been charged interest in years. To get it to zero or close, you'd have to manually send a payment for the current balance and almost no company has that as an option for automatic monthly payments. Usually it's just \"previous statement balance\". Also if you plan to pay more often than once per month, check the terms on the card to see if there is a limit. Some banks only allow X payments per month (I've seen 4 on one card).",

It's like having reddit upvotes. You can get a bunch of them, but you can't spend them anywhere.\n\nThere's also a psychology to something where you have to hit thresholds to get the benefit. You might start to use it as an excuse to soften the blow from making a large purchase.\n\nI'd just use a card that is going to give you cash back or credit to use for arbitrary purchases (I use the Amazon card, and I usually have a balance of points that I can use to buy.. anything.)\n\nThe main reason to use credit cards IMO is the _security_ advantages (also some benefits from making major purchases, such as rental car coverage, extended appliance warranties, etc -- know what those are and use the cards appropriately for those exceptions). The \"reward points\" are just gravy.\n\nAnd to answer your question directly, no, I don't think you should switch back and forth any more frequently than once a year. You need a full year (or several) to see what your spending habits and expense cycles look like. Switching between cards will add variables into the equation and hide changes in spending habits from you.",

Be sure you have the will power to pay off every card at the end of the months.\n\nRight now Americans are carrying approximately 1 trillion in credit card debt.\n\nAll those freebies and perks that are offered by cc are to entice you to buy, go into debt, and owe them interest.\n\nI do carry a mortgage, but that is the only debt I have. My car was bought with cash. I planned ahead, saved and purchased when it was time.\n\nI have a few credit cards. The two major ones I use about once a year to keep them active. If I use my Talbots card in the store, I whip out my debit card and tell them I want to pay off my balance. If it is an online purchase, as soon as the package arrives and I know I am keeping it I pay off the total. My credit score is 820\n\nMy younger sister and her husband do what you are suggesting. They are incredibly disciplined and have it set up with their bank to pay off the balance of the cc in full at the end of the month.\n\nBest of luck",

I have a 4k monthly budget on my card for all things needed including subscriptions and utilities and day care yada yada. On the 30th of every month I pay it off. Also the balance on it helps me know what I have left in the budget for each month. I don\u2019t have to wonder what I\u2019ve spent this month and figure out how my budget is doing. I just look at the balance and know I have X dollars left for groceries or fun or whatever. Plus I get like $150 cash back a month that\u2019s around 2k a year",

The only way I've been successful at using credit cards regularly and ensuring I've not over spent is to use YNAB (you need a budget) for budgeting. The way it handles credit cards within the budget is very helpful. Since I started using it, I now know I always have enough cash on hand to fully pay my credit cards. To the point of even putting them on auto pay for the statement balance, which I never thought was possible for me, but it is with  YNAB!",

However I'm finding that in today's society, they can be put to good use.  Im essentially using my cards in place of my debit cards, a little more security, with all the scams,  theft of financial information on the rise, this is one way to add that extra barrier of protection of your actual financial liquid assets you have at the bank. The less exposure to your bank account numbers and debit card access the better. On top of that, you get   cash back benefits or travel points for spending money you normally would otherwise,  so credit cards  do have their good points but I'm also making sure all balances are paid in full each cycle, I do not want to carry any debt. Use cards wisely and you can make it work for you.  The problem I see is there's this push to make us debtors, be conscientious and responsible, you get rewarded with a higher credit limit, a temptation to spend even more and get into debt.  I don't spend any more than I normally would, I probably won't get a credit line increase as often as a result, but that's a good thing as I do not want to live beyond my means.",

    "postText": "Hi, \n\nI have been working hard to educate myself about retirement, investing, etc (lots of Bogle, then critiques of Bogle, etc) and I'm at this overwhelming point of analysis paralysis. Every time I think I find a financial strategy, there's something else, and now it's been almost a year and I've made very few financial moves for fear of messing it all up. I need help figuring out what to do with the money me and my husband have been dutifully saving for years, how to live &amp; retire well, and how to make sure my 3 year old's life is taken care of.\n\nHusband and I are mid 30s. Husband makes 130k (plus RSUs), me part time 30k. We both have 401k's. I was thinking of opening a Roth IRA for myself--better to dump the whole 6,500 at a certain time? Trickle it through the year? I could do either. The goal is to have a good amount of money for retirement without living so far below our means that we don't enjoy life when we're younger. \n\nWe very recently put 75k each (150k total) in high yield savings accounts (4.6) right now. This was supposed to be saved for a down payment for a bigger house, but rates are awful and I'm balking at buying. We pay 1500/mo right now but a bigger house would be 3500-4000 a month, which just seems insane to me. No debt outside mortgage, but we plan to buy a new 50k SUV soon and will have a monthly payment on that. While we figure the new house part out I was thinking some of this sitting cash should be invested in an index fund or similar for my son? Don't think I'm interested in an account that can only be accessed for school needs. \n\nWe want to retire at 65 at the latest. We want our son to have plenty of money for house/car/life/imminent world collapse. We want to go on vacations and have relatively nice things in the meantime before we die. \n\nThis all sounds pretty damn basic but somehow it's the most complicated thing to me. What accounts would you be putting money into in this scenario? I'm happy to elaborate or give more exact numbers if someone could please break down how they would get on the right path.",

            "comment": "You should be skeptical of any critiques of Jack Bogle. Most active funds do not beat their benchmark over the long term, that\u2019s a fact. So index fund investing is a great (and simple) way to invest.\n\nStatistically, lump sum has a slight edge over DCA. But practically, most people simply have to DCA due to our income limitations. DCA can also help the psychological analysis paralysis factor. But both are better than sitting on your hands for sure, which you\u2019re realizing. \n\nFollow the wiki and prime directive for most of your questions in terms of where to prioritize saving, investing etc. \n\nIn terms of investing, there\u2019s an even simpler option than index funds: target date fund. It\u2019s like autopilot for your investing. Choose the fund with the year closest to when you turn 65 and it will do all the investing and rebalancing for you\n\nMany TDFs like the vanguard TDF use index funds within the TDF, just the fund will manage it all for you instead of you choosing how much US, international, bond, etc.",

            "comment": "Two popular resources are:\n\n* Ramit Sethi's book, *I Will Teach You To Be Rich* and\n* JL Collin's *The Simple Path to Wealth* \n\nI prefer Ramit Sethi because it's a bit more comprehensive, but the advice is similar. **I found after reading this that all of the complicated stuff became much simpler**, which is why I recommend it for you. It also has the same philosophy that saving for retirement and enjoying your life now (living your \"rich life\") needs to be balanced.\n\nAnother popular resource which I strongly recommend you follow is the Prime Directive here on the r/personalfinance wiki. It's a step by step guide for the recommended way for saving for retirement.\n\nRegarding the specific advice for the SUV and house, the general advice is that any money you want to save for a short term goal should be in a HYSA. Anything longer term - at least several years out - you should put in an index fund. Since your house is a \"may buy soon\", I would keep it in the HYSA.",

            "comment": "Do you have a 529 account for college savings for your son?  If not, it\u2019s wise to open one if college is likely in the future for him. Also, I believe that when it comes time for college assets held by the child are weighted higher than assets held by parents for financial aid so if you set up funds in his name that could be counterproductive for aid. It might be better to simply earmark funds that are in your name to give to him at a later age. This also leaves the money available to you should you ever need it in a pinch. \n\nThe Roth may not be terribly beneficial since you would fall into the married 22% tax bracket, so unless you think you\u2019ll make a whole lot more by retirement age it\u2019s probably a wash at best, and you could possibly be paying more now than in retirement. Taxes aren\u2019t my wheelhouse but you could possibly benefit from filing separate because of the income imbalance and in the possibly you would benefit from a Roth since you could file in the 12% single bracket. \n\nThough $150,000 in a HYSA is probably somewhat illogical I would leave it be if you do plant to buy a new house in the short-term. At least I would but I\u2019m on the conservative side. \n\nTake all of this advice with a grain of salt. Also, see if you can find a fee based financial planner that will look at your entire situation and put together a roadmap for you. Some will do this for a fee without managing your assets.",

The PF flow chart breaks it all down for you in step-by-step instructions.\n\nYou can open a Roth IRA today with Vanguard  and invest in a target date fund (TDF) corresponds to the closest year you will turn 65.

    "postText": "Firstly, so sorry if this isn't the right place to ask..I was unsure where to ask.\n\nMy parents house was recently hit by hail/wind storm and their insurance is accepting a full roof replacement.  I don't remember exactly figures but say insurance gave them $16k &amp; withheld $2k as deductible so net of $14k. We tried negotiating with the roofing company to just take the $14k and not charge us an extra for the deductible, however he said that's insurance fraud and bla bla so we accepted to pay him the deductible.\n\nHowever, now we're talking to a few family friends and some are saying they just gave the roofing company the insurance check and it was just that, they paid nothing out of pocket. Now I'm feeling a little upset/sad at myself that I got my parents to send them the deductible without doing any research on if it is the norm or not. I hate thinking that my parents got scammed even though it's a reputable roofing company that my neighbor even used and I thought they did a good job.",

They also mentioned that it's probably going to cost a bit more than $16k and they'll bill the insurance for that excess amount.\n\nEdit: now that I think about it though, maybe they communicated on the back end with insurance. Idk",

If the roofer charges too much, insurance calls them out and says here's what we'll pay. Etc.\n\nOn the flip side, if while repairing, there is actual additional damage found, roofers submit a supplement estimate to insurance and wait for approval. Your parents payment to the roofers is the deductible and insurance covers the rest. \n\nOften times, Roofers say they'll do the whole roof to warrant all the work done to cover it, but that doesn't mean insurance covers a new roof. It's recommended vs required. Insurance is only required to make whole what was lost... Only if damage is extensive enough or spread out across enough of the entire roof will that justify a whole replacement. Also, depending on the insurance company, they might only pay ACV which means it's replacement cost minus depreciation (Actual Cash Value). Some will cover RC up to half life or the first 10 years, etc. State farm is the only company I know to have full RC on the life of the roof.",

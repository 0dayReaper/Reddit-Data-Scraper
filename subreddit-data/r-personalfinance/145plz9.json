    "postText": "I got a 25,000$ bonus and have 9,000$ of credit card debt. I\u2019m also about to move out from my parents house. \n\nI plan to pay off my whole credit card and use some remaining money to move. I will be debt free aside from student loans.\n\nWith the rest of the money, should I..?\n\n1. Put it in my credit unit savings account. It currently has 5k and makes $8-9 a month in dividend payments. It\u2019s based on a percentage of my account and that percentage has grown each month.\n\n2. Invest in my IRA which gets dividends auto reinvested but pay a lot less. Sometimes like $.50 or less per month. \n\nI feel like this is dumb but I don\u2019t want to do the wrong thing.",

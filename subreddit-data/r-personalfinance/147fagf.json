I see Enterprise offers specific waivers, but I can't tell if insurance is already included. Does anyone know if insurance is included, if I should go through a third party, and/or the add on waivers are needed?\n\nEdit: I don't own a car/car insurance.",

Basically, it's just collision, not liability. Typically, they will NOT cover damage you cause to any other vehicles or property. \n\nOP - if you don't have private car insurance, get insurance through Enterprise.",

Also will it cover me in other states or countries?  The rental insurance provided by my credit card definitely will.  I decline additional coverage from the company and just use my credit card's policy as my insurance.  It covers up to $75k so that will completely replace any car I have.",

It will float over to a rental. \n\nThat being said you will have to pay a deductible (rental cars damage waiver will cover that). \n\nI would call your company youre insured with, to ask for verification that you have full coverage, and it floats over to a car rental.\n\nUsually if its cheap, I just get the rental car insurance anyway.

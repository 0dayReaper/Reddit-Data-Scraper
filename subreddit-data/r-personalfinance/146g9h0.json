The \"college portfolio\" appears to be 20% cash, 65% bonds, and only 15% stock. That's because they're assuming that your child will be needing that money fairly soon. Depending on when you actually expect that money to be needed, that may be too conservative or it might not be. If they need it within the next couple years, then yeah it probably shouldn't be in SPYD, you could lose 50% of it if a recession comes and there would be no time for it to come back.",

If so, unlikely \n\nIf the procedure financed in 2022 was actually performed in 2022, then it is not going to be considered eligible for reimbursement from a 2023 FSA account.  Considering we're already in June, you've probably already passed your claims cut off date for the 2022 account, but if you happen to have any funds left from your 2022 FSA, it wouldn't hurt to check with your admin to see if they would consider it.",

            "comment": "Probably not, but it could be worth asking your particular FSA provider.  Plans can vary, and yours might be different from a typical one.\n\nIn general, FSA reimbursements can only be done against expenses incurred within its plan year,.  This is based on the date you actually received the medical care, not when you got the bill(s).  FSAs occasionally have a \"grace period\" where a service done in February 2023 is eligible to be reimbursed using 2022 FSA funds.  Since we're in June, this would probably only apply if your plan year started in March or later.  Most plans reset January 1st, but there are exceptions.\n\nAFAIK, any payment plan where you continue payment for last year's expense into this year doesn't change the service date for purposes of FSA eligibility.",

            "comment": "A loan modification is usually because you\u2019re unable to pay the mortgage as agreed, and is a deal negotiated with the lender aimed at not having to foreclose under the theory that getting something is better than nothing.  It nearly always significantly hurts your credit.\n\nNot as bad as for foreclosure, but usually comes with significant negative credit consequences.\n\nA refinance is something you can do unilaterally (a modification requires agreement) for any reason you want without consequence.",

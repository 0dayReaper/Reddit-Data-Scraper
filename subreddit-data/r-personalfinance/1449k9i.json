    "postText": "I am very novice to anything regarding finances. I have been flat broke most of my life, basically raised in absolute poverty where even food was not secure, and all my skills are centered around how to survive on minimum budget, no budget.\nHowever, after a ton of post secondary education and a few years of full time work plus a side hussle,, I am now in a different position. I feel that I have non of the skills relevant to living in a middle class life.\n\nMy first question is, how do I decide on what to pay off first. My credit cards are all zeroed with no debts. I have student loans, a mortgage, and some loans from relatives that I kept a detailed records of hoping to pay off someday. Do I pay them off individually then move on to next, do I pay them off gradually all at the same time, do I invest my money and pay minimum of all debts for now?",

Then when family is paid off focus on the the student loans and then your 401k/ mortgage. All depending what your interest rate is on mortgage, if it\u2019s 3% or less I wouldn\u2019t be in a huge rush to pay it off, depending on your age.",

            "comment": "Student loans and mortgage depend on the interest rate and tax situation. Generally, you pay off the higher interest rate first. If the interest rates are low (as student loans and mortgages often are), it might be a good idea to invest or do something else with your money rather than making more than the minimum payment.\n\nFamily loans are different. It depends on expectations. And I imagine that these people might appreciate being paid back in a lump sum for simplicity rather than in installments. Maybe start a savings account where you save up enough money to pay people back. Even if they didn't ask for it, consider giving them \"interest\" on top of what they lent you, if you think it's appropriate (e.g. you are now in a financially stronger position than they are). There's a good chance some people will refuse repayment. Ask them if they'd like you to do something else with the money instead (e.g. charity). It'll be more of a social thing than a financial thing.",

    "postText": "\nHello all, \n\nI recently made my first auto payment on 6/9 on a new-used vehicle. My payment amount is $496 and I paid $1100. I asked for the excess to go towards the principle of the loan. \n\nLogging into my account today I see that my financed amount lowered from $23,345.23 to $22,667.93. \n\nAdditionally, my next payment is scheduled for August 10, even though I am scheduled to pay monthly, so my next payment should actually be ~July 10.\n\nDoes this seem right? Did my payment actually go towards the principle and I assume they just counted the overpayment as my July payment? \n\nI\u2019m planning to pay ~$1100 monthly until paid off. \n\nThanks",

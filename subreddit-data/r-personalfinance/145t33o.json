    "postText": "Basically the title. In 2017, I went to an outpatient treatment; insurance covered part of the cost, but an extension of treatment was-- unbeknownst to me at the time-- was not covered and the approximate payment at that time was about $2.4k. Being severely depressed, I was not aware of the charges and a family member that was helping me pay was also unaware. I was not a minor at the time of treatment.\n\nNow my current debt (my bank app says 'closed' and 'in collections'- I could not find any evidence that the agency tried to contact me in the past several years due to several factors) is standing at about $4.5k including interest; the hospital offered to settle it down to \\~$3.3k, but I'm worried that the charges will tank my credit. Family member advises not to pay as it will majorly impact my credit, but they also are not very credit-smart. Hospital also offered an application to see if I qualify for debt write-off if I make under a certain amount per month for the last three months. Any help is very much appreciated!",

I went to outpatient in 2016 and it was gonna cost me an outrageous amount of money but the hospital I was at had a program that covered the costs. Even if you have to earn less and bide your time for 3 months, it'll be better than owing a bunch and having bills in collections",

Would paying the hospital directly impact my credit directly  (they seem amenable to it, even though it also seems they handed the bill off to a debt-collector)? Definitely agree that just paying it off be better than still owing.",

It would be awful to refresh the date on that debt by making a payment.\n\nMost medical debt is non-collectible after 3 to 5 years. Tell the collection company to pound sand then let the debt drop off your credit report after 7 years.",

            "comment": "My wife was charged $8k for a basic colonoscopy (not joking). After months of negotiating, they lowered the cost a little bit, but they refused to reduce the charge to a competitive level based on research. I asked for justification for their non-competitive pricing, and after six weeks they came back with nothing more than marketing blather. Eventually we applied for financial assistance, and they wiped out all payments for a six-month period.\n\nI hated that route, but I had put in a good faith effort to negotiate a fair price with them. But instead of getting our final offer (around $3k), they got almost nothing from us.\n\nIn my research, I discovered that hospitals are just about the most predatory entities in the US. Not just ours, but many similar hospital networks across the country are bleeding people dry. Transparency was supposed to be fixed by legislation, but most hospitals are still not in compliance. People trust that hospitals will always do things in our best interest, but it's simply not true for many of them.\n\nKeep fighting.",

They didn't seem to care about that information.\n\nThey offered an immediate 15% \"uninsured\" discount. I wasn't technically uninsured, but my coverage was paltry.\n\nThey wouldn't move any further off that amount. They offered a payment plan with no interest, but the procedure was still insanely overpriced.",

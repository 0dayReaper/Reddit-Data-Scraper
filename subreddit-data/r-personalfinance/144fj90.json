    "postText": "Hello everybody, \n\nI\u2019m currently in the process of enrolling for my Masters Program in Finance. \n\nThe total estimated tuition cost will be 25k over a 2 year period. \n\nI currently have a car loan that is 5.8 APR with a balance of $22400\n\nI have a brokerage account with savings of $24,800 and it\u2019s sitting as cash at the moment. I have already paid the taxes and whatnot. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if it would be better to pay off the car loan and have about $8k in savings leftover. Or hold the cash in a Money Market Fund and use it to pay for my tuition over the next few years. \n\nI bring home about $3k a month after taxes. \n\nSo I can manage the car payment with budgeting.",

So I would keep $12k in saving for this, plus maybe $6k for an emergency fund.  Take the rest and pay towards the car. \n\nContinue to save and make sure you have the next $12k for tuition by next summer.  Take any extra savings and put it towards the car loan.  You probably will be paying off the car pretty soon.  Congrats.",

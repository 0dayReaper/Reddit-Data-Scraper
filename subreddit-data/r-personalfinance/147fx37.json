You don't need a new truck at 18.   Save some money and buy an old truck and work on your credit history another way.",

Or you can take the hit with a higher interest loan by going it alone then refinance at a better rate once you've built up your credit profile.\n\nHowever, at 18, you should look at buying a low cost older truck that's in good shape.  For example, I'm eyeballing a 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 SLT 5.7L Hemi for $2750.  It has 210K miles on it and has no rust.  This would be the prefect vehicle for my 18 year old son.  Actually, I'll probably take it and he can drive my 2002 Ram 1500 with the 4.7L.",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m currently a resident but will be moving to another state for an attending position. My salary will significantly increase and I\u2019ve found a home I\u2019d like to purchase (whose mortgage I\u2019d only be able to afford on the new job\u2019s salary). The developer has their own mortgage company that I\u2019m going through and they\u2019ve set a close date for 6/14. However, the underwriter is saying my medical license for the state I\u2019m moving to is required for approval of my loan, which is the only thing left. I applied for my license back in February, but this process is slow. Many people have said it could take 6 months. My job start date isn\u2019t until September so it shouldn\u2019t be a problem on that end, but it seems to be a problem on the loan end. I have my training license for my current state and no outstanding records that should preclude approval of the license. I have called and emailed my reviewer multiple times but I haven\u2019t gotten a response. I am confident my license will be approved just doubt any time soon. Anyone here have thoughts on what to do or how to get around this predicament? Do underwriters really need proof of my medical license? Thanks for any and all advice.",

Most likely their \"preferred lender\" is a smaller outfit with more strict standards for credit underwriting reasons (also potentially owned by the developers themselves).\n\nYou can potentially get a more favorable arrangement elsewhere. Possibly someplace that would be willing to accept your offer letter from your new position as evidence enough of income. Maybe not, but it's your right as a borrower to consider other arrangements.",

            "comment": "1) I would shop around for other mortgages, don't be stuck the the developers. Some banks have special programs for physicians, as you loan risk is significantly lower than most. These will generally be easier to work with, although you may not necessarily get the best rate. I used one when graduating residency and moving to a new city,and the main thing they needed was my offer letter from the hospital I was going to be working at.\n\n \n2) assuming your new position is with a hospital system of some sort and not a private practice group, they may have some resources to aid you. I did not know about it at the time, so didn't help me, but I discovered later that my hospital system actually guarantee a certain amount to the banks to help you get a mortgage.",

I\u2019m an NP and have had a job offer since early February but I\u2019m still waiting to be fully credentialed and I can\u2019t start my job until I\u2019m verified by most of the major payers. One lender I spoke with said that I must start working before our closing date whereas a different lender just said I have to complete all pre-employment requirements. Did your lender have any concerns about you starting your job a few months from now due to the large discrepancy in incomes?",

            "comment": "Been in the mortgage industry for 7 years. Unfortunately, you're going to have a tough time getting around this one assuming that you're not using a niche lender program with a profession specific program. Every lender can have their own UW guidelines, but the majority have very similar guidelines. From how I understand your scenario, you have an accepted employment contract as an attending but have not received a paycheck.  One of the requirements for that scenario is typically that your employment contract be non-contingent or that all contingencies for your employment have been met. The satisfaction of all contingencies would have to be verified by your employer. It is not unreasonable for underwriting to want to see confirmation that you are able to work at this higher paying position as you admittedly cannot afford the mortgage without it. All that being said, there are profession specific mortgage programs out there and a lot of them have lender specific guidelines. No two mortgage shops are the same. Hope that helps and good luck getting the license!",

You should have your short term savings (say 3 months expenses worth) available in cash or cash equivalents. But longer than that you're going to want to have stored in low-risk investments. So while owning short and mid term treasuries for example might be a drag in the short term you'll appreciate it next time the S&amp;P takes a 44% drop like it did in 2008. The last thing you want to do is be forced to sell in the middle of a dip due to income needs. It's also worth noting a market decline is exactly when you're most likely to need to withdraw money from being laid off.",

I'd also recommend keeping your insurance deductible(s) on top of that, in case an emergency happens where you are out of work for several months + have to pay your deductible. It's important to have a good sum of liquid cash.\n\nThe average CPI (inflation rate) over the past 10 years in the US is 1.77%. There are a few options out there for savings accounts that match that average CPI by within 0.5%, so at least you don't lose much from the money just depreciating in value. You're probably not going to find anything that'll meet or beat inflation though in a savings account outside of the very odd credit union, but you can get close with Ally (1.25% APR for savings) or Redneck Bank (yes, it's a real bank, 2% APR for checking which beats the average CPI).",

I keep about $6-8k in liquid cash available and often think about what a waste that is. I cannot think of a case where I would need to produce more than that much cash on demand in under 48 hours. I have a very high credit limit in case of a true emergency, and can have my life savings in my bank account 48-72 hours if needed, so I really don't see the need for so much liquid cash in a savings account.

There is no adding interest that day, it'd be a pending transaction and account will not be allowed to close.  Or it hit that morning and became a posted transaction depending on how the bank does it (refund fees are immediate posts at SWIM's work and can be closed that day). OR a banker just gave you all cash to drop to zero with intent to close the next day and forgets to.  That's likely 99% of the time SWIM's personal 10 year experience. People close accounts because they don't have the same titling (closing a business account, the owner may not have accounts else where to deposit),  or someone actually asks for cash and they are willing to take someone's word of 4 month experience to remember to close an account, because they desperately need funds available (cash) before next business day or longer.  \n\nAlways get proof don't just trust someone.  Get a cashiers check when closed and sign the debit form closing it through their teller system.  Literally if you are just given cash, it's a pending transaction *even though it's cash*, and a banker physically cannot close it by regulation....\n\nEdit: already too long but feeling like educating those that may not know what I think is seemingly F'd up and counter-intuitive? You can't just remove someone from an account even if they want to be taken off. If your mom opened your first checking account with you because you needed an adult to obtain it, you cannot remove her even if she comes in, completely willing to.  You can get in the biggest fight with your spouse/family member, can't remove them, but can close the account and open a new one without their name as a signer, with the same money/check produced at closing.  Death and sometimes divorce are the only ways to remove someone, yet just one owner can decide to close the account without the other signer present.  This will always baffle SWIM even in the industry...  okay done. ",

People were pushed to open accounts and incentivized, this is why you have that \"scandal\" of fake accounts being open a few months back in Wells Fargo and BoA. Corporate doesn't give a shit about your low earners, they care more about small business and the few clients with lots of cash sitting around.  \n\ni remember we had to go around auditing performance and some overzealous branches that opened up brand new accounts for all their family members/friends, that inflated the supposed pool of potential customers and when they couldn't produce investments or long term saving accounts a few heads got chopped, some branches got closed down, staff got downsized, etc. ",

I never used the checking account. No charges were ever incurred for my checking account which heald a  balance of $25, the amount required to set it up. Now my savings account had a minimum balance of $300. Even if I withdrew one penny below that amount, and then immediately added finds to the account in excess of the $300 minimum, I incurred a $5 fee. On top of that I couldn't go into a branch office and make a transaction with a teller more than 3x per month or else I incurred another $5 fee. \n\nNow I was a member of BoA for almost 10 years. For the most part I didn't have a problem, but being a broke college student, I didn't alway have the $300 minimum. So one day I  finally got fed up enough, paid off my credit card I had with BoA amd closed all  my accounts. I triple checked to make sure I had no debts owed to the bank.\n\nSo 1 year later, I am surprised to get a letter in the mail from none other than Bank of America. They were charging me $60 for not having the minimum balance in the accounts I closed the year before.\n\nNever responded to the letter and never heard from BoA again. They are a terrible bank and I would never recommend that any one use them.\n\nFast forward several years. My credit union expanded, and opened new branches near me. Never been charged a dime.

Awesome. I like USAA b/c it's all online banking, I can get cash from any ATMs, and they give me back my fees up to 10 withdrawals a month. I only pull out cash once a month (if that!). I can deposit checks from my phone too. oh and excellent customer service - never had any issues and they're actually nice.",

Somebody screwed up with a check and following the check incident they refuse to cash any check without my dad coming in to verify the check. He spoke to them but they didn't want to hear about it. Tell them fine and walks across the street to another bank explains the situation and sets up all the appropriate accounts. He then walked back across the street and requested cashier's checks for the full balance of each account. They kind of freaked out and after speaking to the manager and threatening that he would call the police if they didn't release the money that was his they finally gave him the checks. He walked back across the street and deposited them into the new accounts. Moral of the story is that all banks are pretty much the same and you should use one that treats you right.",

For our home loan, they only required 10% down for no PMI, even on a jumbo loan like ours (live in CA, all homes are jumbo), that saved us $359 a month in PMI!!!

I'll be damned if you're going to give him less than what he deserves. The bank didn't organize my garage, this gentleman did, and you're going to honor this contract I have with him by paying the full amount of this check.\n\n&gt;*Mr. X, it's bank policy to charge non customers for cashing a check.*\n\n&gt;Fine. I'll withdraw all my money and take it elsewhere. My first withdraw will be $500 cash, so I can pay this gentleman for the work he performed. I'll take the rest in a cashier's  check. \n\nIt was like $300,000. He was that livid and he ignored managers and supervisors who begged him not to close his accounts. He left just enough in to cover any payments that hadn't cleared. \n\nLPT: Yes, it's important to find out what your bank offers you as an account holder, but you also need to find out how your bank treats those that you do business with. They may be paying less to your customers than what you intended. ",

You didnt *cash* the check, you *deposited* the check. There is a difference between cashing a check and depositing one. \n\nAlso, we typically only hold checks if the balance in your account is lower than the amount of the check. Even then, it\u2019s only a day or two(excluding weekends and holidays). If the check bounces, then we just need to make sure you have enough to cover it. \n\nEDIT: Obviously every bank and account is different. Same goes for ATM/mobile deposits. Some people get their funds right away without issue. Congratulations, you probably manage you\u2019re money very well! My bank will usually make $400 available right away and the rest tomorrow morning. There are also many people who come in to the bank with a personal check for $1980 and an average daily balance of $50 and expect all of the funds right away. Sorry, we just want to protect your money and ours. If that check bounces, you now have negative $1930 and ~~a ton~~ of overdraft fees. \n\nEDIT 2: Sorry, i misspoke. There would only be one overdraft fee in this scenario. Lol",

So I walked into one of these partner credit unions the teller was processing the check and then started to tell me that depending on my credit union it may not be available, stopped mid sentence, and said it's all there.\n\nIt's totally worth it to bank with these guys despite how far away they are. I also haven't been charged an overdraft fee. Ever. They just turn off the account until money is back in the account.",

I work at a credit union. Standard hold is 5 business days, but I rarely actually hold any of the funds, because I either have a relationship with the member, or they have regular direct deposits/have been a member for years/maintain good balances. We check this criteria constantly to prevent losses, because we accept the blame for any losses incurred as a result of us waiving the standard hold time.",

Eventually I started getting electronic statements only.\n\n  \nI was content with BOA for so long, I never really looked around to see what benefits other banks and credit unions offered. But making me pay for statements got me looking.  Not long after that I joined a credit union, and closed my BOA accounts I had for 30+ years.  And the credit union sends paper statements.   \n\nHope it was worth it for BOA to get a couple months of $3 fees before they lost me as a customer.  ",

Here's what happened to me over the course of a few years until I took my business to Ally.\n\n* Sign up for a free checking account. They're called free because there is no fees, no minimums, no requirements at all. You sign a CONTRACT which stipulates to their rules (nevermind that they can break their own rules whenever they want).\n\n* They change the rules and start charging a fee. I call for an explanation, which is that now the account isn't called \"Free Checking\" that's been discontinued. Now I must agree to \"Online Checking\" - sign another contract which stipulates their new rules. For online checking you can't use a teller or be caught dead or alive inside a branch (even to use a \"FREE PERSONAL BANKER\" which are the people at the desks). They'll even charge you a fee if you come inside and say \"Hey, your ATM just ate my card and I don't have access to my money.\"\n\n* They change the rules again and start charging a fee. I call for an explanation. Now the excuse is that in order to avoid a fee for \"Online Banking\" you must have at least two direct deposits a month into EACH account. So I do that, to avoid the fee.\n\n* They start charging a fee again. I call for an explanation. This time it's just an error since I'm complying with their 3rd rule changes.\n\n* They start charging a fee again. Again, it's just an \"error\" wink wink. I start wondering how many customers that are complying with their rules just don't even notice or call them on their \"error\" which nets them MILLIONS of cash. When I person takes money they aren't entitled to, it's called stealing. When a multinational, multi-billion dollar company does the same thing, it's called an \"error\" wink wink.\n\n* They start charging a fee again. I call for an explanation. Which is that now, even though I originally signed up for a FREE checking account, agreed to conduct my business online only, added direct deposits of paychecks, and have NEVER had an overdraft in my life, I must maintain a daily average balance of (whatever it was at the time). I then explain the purpose of a zero interest checking account, which is to have as little money in it as possible to cover the checks, and transfer the rest of the money to an account which bares interest (Savings, CDs) or invest in securities. I also mention that I have tens of thousands of dollars in a BOA savings account. The response from BOA was basically 'tough shit, take or leave it' so I closed all of my accounts and opened new ones at Ally.\n\nCouldn't be happier with Ally. Not having a branch has never been a problem (thanks for BOA training me during the \"Online Banking\" phase, ha). Ally also has better interest rates on checking and savings than basically everyone else.\n\nTLDR: Fuck BOA, they change their \"rules\" to screw over their customers all the time. When you repeatedly catch them stealing money, because you are in fact complying with their latest set of rules, they'll refund the money and claim it was an \"error.\"",

Technically you have to open a linked brokerage account with it, but you don't actually have to fund that account. I only use the checking account, and it is so awesome.

No fees for anything, they reimburse the ATM fees that other banks impose to use theirs, fantastic customer service, no problem with slow deposits or anything like that. The handful of times I've accidentally overdrafted due to timing of bills or whatever, I just call them up and be like \"oops my bad\" and there's never been a fee yet. Literally the only possible downside is there's no local branch, but I haven't really ever needed one.",

Headed over and set her up with my bank. \n\nNext month rolls around, and she gets a $10.00 statement from BofA. We take it in, and are told that it was probably mailed prior to us cancelling, so we could ignore it. So we did, until next month another statement arrived, this time with a late fee. \n\nThat started seven months of back and forth with the bank, a notary service (to send a certified fax of our receipt of payment), and the threat of legal action against us for being \u201cbelligerent non-payers\u201d, or something like that. We stood our ground when the branch manager suggested we just put the $10 again to clear up the problem. Only after we sat down with someone from their legal department and informed them of our extreme displeasure with being harassed (we did our research, and they were pushing the legal limits with the calls and letters) did they actually stop. We had the proof that we had paid, from the receipt, to the cameras showing us there, to the teller remembering us (surprised they agreed to say they did). All over ten freaking dollars. \n\nSo yeah, they\u2019re Bank of Ass to us. ",

They are requiring you to have online access to maintain your accounts, as soon NOTHING will be able to be done in a branch.  The model is to have only ATMs at various locations.  They have specific branches to handle high end customers (Multi-million) and only at those will there be actual people.  They are currently intentionally under staffing so that it will be slow at the branch to 'train' its customers to bank online.  When you go to a teller or personal banker (they keep changing the titles of their employees) any work they do on your account is actually them pulling up your online account and getting the online department to do the work.  Did you know that soon you will not be able to deposit cash into any account that you do not sign on and never if you personally do not have an account there?  No going to the bank to pay your rent into your landlord's account, etc...CASH will not be good at a BANK.  You will only be able to deposit the cash into your own account and TRANSFER to another account.  I do not understand how these places stay in business.  They are still forcing ridiculous sales numbers on their employees, then immediately ignoring those accounts because those types of accounts are not what they wish to service.

While it is true the competitive landscape is changing in favor of a lower cost online platform, calling the branch model a MLM scheme is bit out of touch.\n\nThe old model of retail banking is dying and has been dying for some time. A bank doesn't need a branch on every corner to service its retail customers and an increasing amount of consumer transactions are being done via cashless processes (credit, debit, venmo, online transfers, e-checks, etc). As a result banks are evolving to compete in this new landscape -- if they don't, they will continue to carry high fixed costs while seeing customers flee to online focused banks that can offer better rates as a result of having a lower cost platform. Banks are increasingly closing brick &amp; mortar branches as opposed to opening new ones, and laying off branch staff as volumes decline.\n\nWhile my banking experience falls outside of the retail side of banking, I'd bet dollars to donuts the limits on which type of \"stranger\" accounts cash can be deposited into has to do with regulatory compliance and wanting to improve the paper trail of cash transfers and deposits to combat money laundering, terrorism financing, etc.\n\nCredit unions are fine, but let's arrive at that conclusion with reasonable logic.

Here's what happened to me over the course of a few years until I took my business to Ally.\n\n* Sign up for a free checking account. They're called free because there is no fees, no minimums, no requirements at all. You sign a CONTRACT which stipulates to their rules (nevermind that they can break their own rules whenever they want).\n\n* They change the rules and start charging a fee. I call for an explanation, which is that now the account isn't called \"Free Checking\" that's been discontinued. Now I must agree to \"Online Checking\" - sign another contract which stipulates their new rules. For online checking you can't use a teller or be caught dead or alive inside a branch (even to use a \"FREE PERSONAL BANKER\" which are the people at the desks). They'll even charge you a fee if you come inside and say \"Hey, your ATM just ate my card and I don't have access to my money.\"\n\n* They change the rules again and start charging a fee. I call for an explanation. Now the excuse is that in order to avoid a fee for \"Online Banking\" you must have at least two direct deposits a month into EACH account. So I do that, to avoid the fee.\n\n* They start charging a fee again. I call for an explanation. This time it's just an error since I'm complying with their 3rd rule changes.\n\n* They start charging a fee again. Again, it's just an \"error\" wink wink. I start wondering how many customers that are complying with their rules just don't even notice or call them on their \"error\" which nets them MILLIONS of cash. When I person takes money they aren't entitled to, it's called stealing. When a multinational, multi-billion dollar company does the same thing, it's called an \"error\" wink wink.\n\n* They start charging a fee again. I call for an explanation. Which is that now, even though I originally signed up for a FREE checking account, agreed to conduct my business online only, added direct deposits of paychecks, and have NEVER had an overdraft in my life, I must maintain a daily average balance of (whatever it was at the time). I then explain the purpose of a zero interest checking account, which is to have as little money in it as possible to cover the checks, and transfer the rest of the money to an account which bares interest (Savings, CDs) or invest in securities. I also mention that I have tens of thousands of dollars in a BOA savings account. The response from BOA was basically 'tough shit, take or leave it' so I closed all of my accounts and opened new ones at Ally.\n\nCouldn't be happier with Ally. Not having a branch has never been a problem (thanks for BOA training me during the \"Online Banking\" phase, ha). Ally also has better interest rates on checking and savings than basically everyone else.\n\nTLDR: Fuck BOA, they change their \"rules\" to screw over their customers all the time. When you repeatedly catch them stealing money, because you are in fact complying with their latest set of rules, they'll refund the money and claim it was an \"error.\"",

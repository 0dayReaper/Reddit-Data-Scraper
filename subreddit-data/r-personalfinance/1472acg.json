    "postText": "I'm a college student interning in Washington for the summer. My permanent residence is in Connecticut but I go to school out of state. I know Washington has no income tax, but Connecticut does. However, Connecticut's residency requirements state the following:\n\n&gt;Under this two-part test, an individual is a resident of this state for a particular tax year if he or she meets either of the following conditions:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;1. was domiciled in Connecticut for the entire tax year, subject to certain exceptions described below; or  \n&gt;  \n&gt;2. was not domiciled in Connecticut but maintained a \u201cpermanent place of abode\u201d here during the entire year and spent more than 183 days here during the year (CGS \u00a7 12-701(1); Conn. Agencies Regs. \u00a7 12-701(a)(1)-1)\n\nSource: [https://www.cga.ct.gov/2020/rpt/pdf/2020-R-0039.pdf](https://www.cga.ct.gov/2020/rpt/pdf/2020-R-0039.pdf) \n\nWashington's residency requirements are as follows:\n\n&gt;The Department of Revenue presumes that a person is a resident of this state if he or she does any of the following:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\\- Maintains a residence in Washington for personal use;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;...\n\nAlthough my permanent residence is in Connecticut, for the 2023 tax year I will live in Connecticut for at total of 4 months which is less than the 183 days. I do have proof that I resided in other states, mainly my leases for both my college apartment and my internship housing.\n\nI want to know if I still have to pay state taxes on my internship income in Connecticut, or if because I can show that I did not live in Connecticut for more than 183 days, I don't need to pay state taxes on my internship income for Connecticut. Thanks.",

    "postText": "I happened upon this article about a driver talking about how much he makes driving for Uber and Lyft: https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-lyft-driver-how-much-money-2019-10#when-it-was-all-said-and-done-i-ended-the-week-making-25734-in-a-little-less-than-14-hours-on-the-job-8\n\nIn short, he says he made $257 over 13.75 hours of work, for almost $19 an hour. He later mentions expenses (like gas) but as an afterthought, not including it in the hourly wage.\n\nThe federal mileage rate is $0.58 per mile. This represents the actual cost to you and your car per mile driven. The driver drove 291 miles for the work he mentioned, which translates into expenses of $169. \n\nThis means his profit is only $88, for an hourly rate of $6.40. Yet reading the article, it all sounds super positive and awesome and gives the impression that it's a great side-gig. No, all you're doing is turning vehicle depreciation into cash.",

            "comment": "I rode with an Older gentlemen about a year ago in a Lyft. He said he is retired and lives with one of his kids and watches his Grandson all week. He said he drove for Lyft just to get out of the house, interact with some other adults and make a little extra but he was comfortably retired. He told me confidently he nets about $6 USD an hour after all factors considered which seemed pretty spot on. I have asked a lot of drivers if they make good money and most seem to think they do or they are just too embarrassed to admit they don't",

It\u2019s really interesting every time I go there, there\u2019s always a new story from an Uber driver. There\u2019s been quite a few people who use the Uber to lobby on whatever issue or company they run. \n\nLast time I was there I had an older guy who was retired and had been doing it for a year or two but it was all so he could get food recommendations. Then he was starting this food map and review system based on passengers stories. Since there\u2019s all the embassy people in DC he would get all their favorite food places for wherever they were from. You\u2019d be able to ask for Bulgiagrian recommendations and he\u2019d have them based on real Bulgiagrians advice. Really great idea, not scalable at all. \n\nEverywhere else I\u2019ve been it\u2019s always just a way to make some money.",

He says something like 90% of his passengers ask him if he drives for Lyft full time then, after he explains that he's a financial advisor who drives for them in his free time, something like 90% of them start asking him questions.  By the time he gets to the destination he's pretty much had an initial appointment with them, hands them his card, and tells them to give them a call if they still have any questions.  He says a good amount of them do.",

Since you drive it for work, especially if you register a corporation and have that own the car you can basically pay all car expenses with untaxed money. You can write off car depreciation, fuel, cleaning, mechanic fees, etc. If you are in high tax bracket and it is luxury car the tax savings can add up",

As the other commenter indicated, one of Uber's primary selling points at first was no tip required. What happened in practice, though, is that some people tipped anyway and some drivers adopted a quid-pro-quo system for giving the rider a 5 star rating in the app in exchange for a tip ($5 for 5). Lyft also offered tipping as an option from day one, so eventually Uber bowed to the inevitable.\n\nIf I understand the model correctly, the passenger still receives one charge to their card just like before, but the amount that you tip theoretically goes straight to the driver, as does their cut of the normal rate that Uber charged you. I haven't used the app much in the past couple years, though, so that may have changed.",

It has all sorts of quirks but the A/C blows cold and the engine runs strong, and it has a relatively new clutch in it (oh yeah, it's a manual too). I work in a well-paid profession and some of the guys at work drive absurdly expensive vehicles. I saw an Aston Martin in the parking lot last Friday. Anyway my point is that if people looked at depreciation as a check they had to write each year, they'd make different choices when buying cars I think.",

The one thing that always cracked me up was that it had steering wheel controls for cruise control and the radio. But I guess they were still hawking the analog technology in the late 90s because if you hit the volume up or down on the steering wheel it actually, mechanically turned the volume knob on the dash accordingly.",

According to Android stats I usually average 6-8 hours a day doing various things on my phone. Work, personal, navigation, games... its used constantly. That makes it more used than my gaming PC, kitchen, mattress, my car... heck if you exclude sleeping I use it more than my apartment (which is more than a new iPhone, every month :( ).\n\nIt's close to 3 years old now (Google Pixel XL) and still runs great. I think it was $850 new. I also drop it frequently enough that I need a new otter box case about once a year... Never had it break, no screen scratches, nothing. It's solid, there's no bullshit, it just works. A phone is not a place to save money if you're going to use it.",

You buy a car for a specific niche demographic, but there's no demand (this is in Denver, so a big city with quite a bit of disposable income flying around) he also told me he lives in Castle Rock, which is a town south of Denver, so he doesn't even have the advantage of being close to his first few rides.  \n\nI was also in a brand new Audi A8 one time and it has these fancy door latches and the driver was like, \"wait I'll get out and let you out and close the door, the sensors are expensive and break easily if you slam the door shut.\"  I'm like Good luck with that buddy.",

            "comment": "I'm an Uber driver. I am part of a community of Uber/Lyft drivers that you can find over at UberPeople.net. Yes you are correct, there are many drivers who do NOT understand the true cost of driving for these companies.\n\nUber and Lyft have been advertising that drivers can make $30 or something per hour with them. That's bullshit. First of all, you can never guarantee that amount because earning money here relies on having passengers. You don't get paid by the hour. You get paid PER MILE and a little per minute. For example, here in LA/OC California, the rates in majority of the places are 60 CENTS PER MILE, 20 CENTS PER MINUTE for Uber (and it keeps getting lower each year). Lyft, from what I've heard from Lyft drivers, is just 30 CENTS PER MILE. Second, serious drivers have to take into consideration the cost of GAS. Here, it's over $4/gallon now!!! Let's say you need to put gas in your car every day and get it to full tank. You're gonna spend $30 to $40 a day at the current prices. Now let's say you start driving passengers around and for that day you made $100. Well guess what, you have to deduct $30 or $40 from that to see how much you probably really made (taxes, depreciation, and other costs not yet included!). So suddenly, you'll see you actually just made only around $60! If you drive Uber full time, you're pretty much guaranteed to have to go to the maintenance shop monthly at around $100 to $120 per visit, not counting the extra costs of whatever they find that you'll need to have fixed!\n\nTips, those are things you shouldn't be counting on as a driver because there is no guarantee you'll receive any. Besides, depending on your market, majority of your passengers might not tip no matter how great your service is or how clean and awesome your car is. \n\nAnother thing that makes it hard to make money with Uber is the lack of information you receive as a driver, regarding the ride request you're receiving. All you really get is the location of where you're supposed to pick up your passenger and their name (whatever name they made up, it can be as ridiculous as Mickey Mouse). The destination will be revealed once you actually have the passenger in the car and you start the trip. Now most recently, Uber started giving us drivers \"ranks\". There are \"Pro\" drivers, \"Gold\" drivers, and \"Diamond\" drivers. Pro drivers are your standard drivers who have medium to low Acceptance Ratings (as in they don't accept all ride requests given to them) and moderate to huge Cancellation Ratings (as in they cancel ride requests for varying reasons). These are your \"smart\" Uber drivers (and I'll explain in a bit why). \"Gold\" drivers are the ones with high Acceptance Ratings and low Cancellation Ratings. These drivers basically accept almost all rides and rarely cancel requests. \"Diamond\" drivers pretty much are near perfect when it comes to having extremely high Acceptance Ratings and almost non-existent cancellation ratings. The higher your rank, the more \"perks\" you get from your Uber Debit Card like 5% gas discounts and the like (which might turn into a credit card later). For Gold and Diamond drivers, they also get information on the general direction of where a ride request is going before they accept the ride, information that is not given to normal Pro drivers. So if that's the case, then why did I say the \"Pro\" drivers are the smart ones?\n\nIn order to make money with Uber, you have to be very picky about which ride requests you take. For example, if you are a Pro driver, you don't get information on the general direction a ride request is going when it pops up on your phone. What you see is where the request is coming from, how many miles it is away from you. For me personally (as well as other drivers), we accept ride requests that are just 3 miles away or less. Why? For each ride, you have a Minimum Fare (it's around $2.40). At 60 cents per mile and 20 cents per minute, you can earn $2.40 after around 3 or 4 miles of driving. If your ride request comes from 3 miles or 4 miles away, you pick up your passenger, and you find out that they're just traveling less than a mile away (or worse, just block away to the nearest liquor store), then you just wasted your gas, time, and money. You are NOT PAID while you're on your way to the passenger, so the 3 or 4 miles you drove to get to them doesn't count! In short, you drove 3 or 4 miles for this person, picked them up, and then dropped them off just a block away, and you only earned the minimum fare of $2.40 due to how short the trip was. Now let's see an alternate scenario. Let's say you received a ride request and it's just less than a mile away from you. Even if it's just a trip to the next block, you'll get the $2.40 minimum fare. So if we compare it, first trip example took a total of 3 or 4 miles plus an extra block to earn $2.40. In the second example, you only drove a total of less than 1 mile plus a block to earn $2.40. Second trip wins because you wasted less time, less gas.\n\nAnother way of making money as an Uber driver now is simply cancelling on passengers who don't show up on time in order to receive a Cancellation Fee ($3.75). Let's say you arrive at the spot on the gps that is where you're supposed to pick up your passenger. A timer shows up, usually 6 minutes in total, that you have to wait for the passenger. If they don't show up in that time, then you have the option of simply cancelling the ride to collect the Cancellation Fee. Drivers are not required to keep waiting on passengers who still haven't shown up after the time limit expires. Drivers who do that are just too kindhearted. If you notice nowadays, especially here in California, there are a lot more cancelled rides unlike before. Reason for this is that drivers have realized that there's no incentive for waiting on passengers beyond the time limit. Let me share my own personal experience. One time I was waiting on a passenger. The time limit already expired. Still, I thought I'd give the passenger an extra 5 minutes. Still no passenger, I even texted and called but there was no reply. Finally the passenger showed up. Guess how short the ride was? Just to two blocks down the road! I only earned $2.75 to $3.00 from that, most of the money came from the waiting time fee, which is just around 12 cents a minute.  Had I cancelled right after the time limit expired, then I would've had gotten MORE money, $3.75. \n\nThere are a lot of other strategies on how to make money with Uber, most of them are dependent on your specific market. Different territory, different pay rates per mile/time, different features you can use, different population. \n\nAnyway go on UberPeople.net if you want to learn more about the problems of rideshare drivers. Don't be surprised if you find that majority of drivers hate Uber. I definitely don't have any loyalty to that company and the moment I have the opportunity to switch to another job, I'd abandon it faster than a warp speeding Enterprise.\n\nOh yeah, according to Uber, [\"drivers aren't essential\"](https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/uber-drivers-ab5-tony-west-ride-share-business-california/), I think this will make people more understanding as to why Uber drivers feel the way they do towards the company.",

                            "comment": "For taxes, if you're an \"independent contractor\" rideshare driver, you can tally up your total miles traveled while working and you can use that to get a huge tax deduction. \n\nThere are two ways you can choose to pay taxes, and you can only pick one of them. First is by using the total miles you traveled to reduce your taxes (there's some computation involved here that I have forgotten how to explain). Second is by recording all the costs of things you use to operate, but not counting the miles. So that includes your cellphone, the bills for the phone, the car washes, the money you spend on gas, and other things you buy. The thing is, all of those costs combined don't compare to the amount of tax deductions you'll get from what the total miles can offer you. Anyway, the best way as a rideshare driver to avoid paying too much taxes is by picking the total miles method.\n\nWhen you use the Uber driver app, it records the total miles you move, but only when you're ONLINE. This is why you need another program or method to record your actual miles per day. For me, I use a program called Stride Tax to record my real working miles.\n\nWorking miles include the time when you turn off the Uber driver app so that you won't get passengers when you're trying to escape a terrible, heavy traffic area (if you can't even get out of traffic, even if someone requests a ride it'll take too long to get to them or you won't be able to me, they'd just cancel and you won't get a cancellation fee because you did not travel a significant distance towards the passenger). Events at stadiums or concerts, they might seem like good ways to get passengers at increased pay rates (surges, it used to be a multiplier system like 1.5x pay increase or higher, but just recently, Uber downgraded it to a crappy flat rate that is randomly determined. Imagine picking up a passenger from a heavy traffic event, you travel 10 miles, and you only make an extra $3 as a bonus on top of your normal 60 cents per mile rate, when before, that same 10 mile ride during a 2X surge would net you around $25 to $30), but again, there's no guarantee that you'll get any meaningful rides that are at least 10 miles or more. This is why Uber drivers go offline to escape a bad traffic situation and go online elsewhere. It's part of the strategy.\n\nSo anyway, the total working miles (both with Uber driver app active and inactive) do total to massive amounts at the end of the year, and that's how most Uber drivers don't pay that much taxes or sometimes, none at all. Anyway it's hard to explain since I just let my tax preparer do the work lol! But that's basically the idea, your miles help you reduce your taxes.\n\nFrom my personal experience, I actually ended up accidentally paying more taxes so they had to give me back around $300. \n\nAs for people skipping taxes, I don't think that's such a smart idea, especially since simply working in this kind of business already pretty much guarantees you won't pay that much taxes or any at all. Skipping taxes is just inviting potential trouble from Uncle Sam's sticky hands. If you go on UberPeople.net, you'll find that people actually pay taxes there. There's even a tax subforum for drivers who have questions about this sort of thing. \n\nI think those who skip paying taxes while working this job are probably new and they don't know yet how your miles you work are the tax killers.",

I think Uber or the theory of ride sharing to be more precise was based on the idea that someone is already driving from point a to point b and their car is empty.  So lets utilize that empty space and have them pick someone up on their way.  This model makes sense because the person driving already has a sunken cost, it does not cost them anything more to pick up a passenger and drop them off along the way they were already going.  This would allow Uber rides to be super cheap.  \n\nAnd for the person driving to make 100% profit.",

Didn\u2019t turn off meter, but told me he did. I sat there there and watched it run up.    \n\n2) Yelled (really started yelling as soon as I got in) at me because his operator told him I was on a different corner. \n\n3) Said he took credit card. Got to destination and credit card system was \u201dbroken\u201d.   \n\n\n4) Asked operator to verify I would get a taxi with a working credit card reader before sending car since I had no cash. Driver said he takes credit card. Got to destination, driver then says he misunderstood and credit card reader is broken. Wife said, \u201cI\u2019m going to try anyway\u201d. It worked fine. Yelled at me when I didn\u2019t give him a tip.    \n\n5) Driver took the really long way to airport. Clicked off meter as we arrived and told me a price $5 higher than what was last displayed.      \n\n\n\u2014\u2014   \n\n\nMy last 25 Uber/Lyfts:  \nNever had an issue. One driver offered to give me a couple of dollars when she accidentally missed my turn. \n\nThe taxi cab industry can\u2019t die off soon enough as far as I\u2019m concerned. I\u2019d gladly pay a little more not to have a fight every single ride.",

He scoffs, starts arguing with me over paying cash which I finally do with the requirement that I get a receipt.  He agrees, forgets the receipt 10 seconds later after I hand him cash and hands me a blank piece of paper then says, \"Fill out whatever you want\".  Dude I'm expensing this, I need some sort of legit records not something that looks like I'm trying to scam my company.

They are keeping drivers and passengers accountable with a global ranking system, and they offer a globally consistent experience.\n\nIt's more than that.\n\nThere's a significant quality control advantage to Uber.  If a cabbie smells/drives like a maniac/plays bad music at an obnoxious volume, I have little recourse as a passenger.  Most cities have a complaint line, but I have to go out of my way to call and it's unclear if the city will actually do anything (based on how many terrible cabbies there are, my guess is most cities don't do anything). With Uber, I give feedback easily through the app and Uber is able to manage their drivers.  Maybe anecdotal, but I've had way, way fewer bad experiences with Uber drivers than cabs.\n\nThere's also a huge benefit for personal safety.  If I were a 120 pound woman, I'd be very reluctant to get into a strange cab at 2 am.  With Uber, you know who the driver is and (more importantly) if something happens to you there's an electronic record of you getting into that specific Uber.\n\nAnd even if the cost isn't lower, having the predictability is really nice for longer trips.",

Makes me wonder how many drivers have the correct insurance. \n\nDo either company check the insurance coverage of their drivers?",

I drive Uber/Lyft in my free time since I wasn\u2019t doing much else and am usually between $30-$40/hour before expenses. After expenses and taxes I\u2019m usually more about the $20 range. If you can show me a job that I can work whenever I have free time (not on anyone else\u2019s schedule) that I can earn $20/hr after taxes that requires extremely minimal effort then I might switch but for now it\u2019s an easy way to pick up a few hundred bucks a month.",

            "comment": "I'm going to give the internet my secret to how I use and drive for Uber/Lyft.\n\nI use it on my commute home using destination mode. I don't stay out late, change routes, or chase surges. I just flip on the app and make my way home. Here's how I justify it:\n\n1. I'm already headed in the direction anyway, so my time and mileage is consider sunk cost.\n2. The slight detour that I'll usually incur, which would be due to taking an early exit into a housing development that I would have otherwise driven right past is what I'll use to calculate $/hr revenue. On the days I get rides, it's $10-$15 for  every 10 minutes added to my drive home, that equates to an effective $60-$90/hr range. (I'll get to wear/tear, taxes)\n3. I only do it on my way home. You never know how much of a detour the ride might take you. I don't have to be \"on-time\" in getting home. It is not worth it to be late to my job so I never do it on my way to work.\n4. Most people requesting rides at 5pm rush hour are not the rowdy type pax stories you read about. They're just trying to get home too. I've had zero issues with passengers in the 3 years I've been doing this.\n5. Weather and events: The trains are down? A conference in town? Surge rates bring my rate to 2x-3x what I usually make to $120-$180/hr. More than what I make at my desk.\n6. This is my second favorite reason: I deduct the miles on my tax return. I like to look around and imagine I'm the only guy sitting in miserable traffic with the commute considered a taxable expense! Given that some days I get no rides, I actually filed a loss on my 2017 and 2018 taxes, further reducing my taxable income. Double win!\n7. This is my favorite reason I driver for Uber: I get to chat about finances with strangers. I'm a 9-5 white collar professional pulling in 6 figs. I dress sharp, drive a nice/clean car. Naturally people are curious as to why I drive for uber. I subscribe to FIRE. I spread the word. As you can expect when I talk about this topic, it blows many people's minds. It's a 15-20 minute conversation between 2 strangers so I tell them everything: My story, my track to retire early, and how I'm doing it. This conversation not only helps pass the time, but it inspires many people. This usually turns into receiving a nice tip at the end of the ride. Some even ask if I'm single ;)",

I asked him how he meant and he brought up surge pricing. He said nowadays, drivers don't get the difference between normal price and surge price, they get a pitiful \"bonus\" instead while Uber pockets the rest.\n\nUber's entire justification for charging 2-4x as much for rides used to be that the drivers benefited and would be more likely to be available during peak hours. Now what's the justification? It just screws over riders and drivers alike.",

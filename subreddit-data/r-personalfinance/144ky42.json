    "postText": "Hiii everyone!\n\nI graduated in May 2022, I have a job working in tech sales. My base salary is 63k (my base salary + bonus is about 83k). I budget based on my base salary. \n\nI\u2019ve saved up about 30k so far and I\u2019m wondering if I should spend $20,500 to pay my student debt off. I don\u2019t make any payments right now, but payments will start in September. The $9,500 left over would be my emergency fund (I only need 10k for a 6month emergency fund). \n\nThe alternative is to take 20k and use it as a down payment on property to eventually turn it into rental property.\n\nCurious to hear what others would do?",

How far into the future do you plan to make it into a rental property? any specifics on what you expect it to cash flow as?",

I\u2019m also first gen so I don\u2019t have any financial help from my parents/family. \n\n1. The loans are direct subsidized loans, so no interest has been accumulating and it doesn\u2019t show what the future interest would be. \n2. I plan to do a FHA loan so technically I\u2019ll have to live in the property for at least a year\n3. No specs on cash flow yet - I\u2019m still looking for the property, but I\u2019m targeting the property close to the University.",

You should try to put a portion or at least the $20,500 of the money down on the student loan debt before the Covid-19 freeze is lifted later this year.\n\nThen try to keep around $10,000 for the 6 month emergency fund if you don't have any savings aside from the money mentioned in your original post.",

This will allow you to obtain a favorable mortgage rate from your lender in the future and frees up more cash for your monthly budget.",

    "postText": "Hello, I am looking to lease a Toyota. I am self employed. I earn around 88k a year. My rent cost me around 1300 and I have paid it consistently for 3 years. I have a credit score of 710. My credit card limit is 19K and my line of credit has a limit of 5K. I do not have a previous auto loan or any other loans. The car I am looking to lease is 70K and I can put down 12-13k down as a down payment. I understand putting down money for a lease is frowned upon but I don\u2019t think I have any chance of getting approved without it and I am looking to buy it outright once the lease ends. The car right now is advertised with an interest rate of 7.4 if leasing. \n\nDo I have a good chance of getting approved? I am in Canada by the way. Also, is a lease easier to get approved then financing?",

            "comment": "It seems like your credit score is decent and you have a good chance of getting approved.\n\nHowever, I'd like to point out one thing that will probably be an obstacle, which is your self-employment. The auto insurance company will probably want extensive proof of your employment through bank statements, direct deposits you pay to yourself, proof of consistent salary, and basically anything that proves you are, indeed, employed.\n\nMy mother is self-employed and had issues with this when trying to be approved for a house. I know this isn't the same as getting approved for an auto loan, but it will definitely be a question that comes up. A lot of people can put down on their applications that they're self-employed when they're \"in between jobs\". I'm not saying you're doing this, but it may be what the auto company will think unless you're able to prove your self-employment and business ownership. All they want to know is if you can pay the balance of the loan each month so they don't have to repossess the car in the future.",

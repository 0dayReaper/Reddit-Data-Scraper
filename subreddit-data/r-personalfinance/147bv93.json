    "postText": "Background: \n*22yo male just graduated college with a business degree debt free\n*Opened a brick and mortar business off of saved liquid assets in 2021 while going to school full time\n*Currently seeking a sales role with base salary and comission after college while running business\n\nFinancials:\n*Net worth is around 15k, all cash no debt\n*Currently budget month to month for business and personal\n\nSituation: \nAt this point it will be year 2 of running my brick and mortar storefront. I pay rent utilities inventory etc but lose money month to month (i am still personally able to be in a \u201cpersonal net profit\u201d because i do side jobs that pay me the money that exceeds any loss from my business). I lose about 500-1000$ from my biz every month (no loans or anything this is off of cashflow and personal funds). Sales are 1000-1500/mo and have been for 2 years (ik its pathetic).My lease ends next year this time of year and will mark year 3 of running my business. \n\nI know this is ultimately up to me and my persistence but my question is should i keep running my business? This question seems rhetorical given my background. I know generally most businesses dont really blossom till years 5-10 but the business has been stagnant for me. Some days i feel motivated and remember the vision i wanted for this when i started and then some days im just like fuck this shit. I also have a dilemma: i have desires to start other ventures like content creation and personal training and enjoy that a lot more than what im currently doing. I could do that while running my biz and working a full time job but it would be a lot to manage. \n\nWhats keeping me from quitting is:\n*afraid of letting myself and supporters down\n*letting 3 years of work go to waste\n* someone could do what i do and execute it better\n\nWhy i want to quit:\n*my networth would be a lot higher from not losing so much money from the biz and deovting time else where\n*life would be alot better with doing what i want (whats your take on doing things for the vision vs doing things you love for money?)\n*i would have saved a lot of years of my youth to live my life (i know as an entreprneur you dont get to live this luxury)\n\nThere are 2 types of responses i know i will receive: the \u201cyoure an entreprener this is how youre supposed to feel and it should make or brake you plus youre in a good fiancial situation\u201d or the \u201cif it doesnt make you happy, just quit, its not worth wasting your youth if you think you\u2019ll fail\u201d\n\nIf you could, to elaborate on your statement whatever type it is like above and go in depth would be very much appreciated and please share your personal experiences thanks!",

As mentioned a lot of companies dont really blossom until years 3-5 but i feel as if im living a \u201cfalse hope\u201d continuing to run this and no growth in revenue. I\u2019ll take this into consideration",

You need a clear idea of what's going to happen over the next few years in terms of the growth you expect and what you can do to instigate the growth etc. Just sitting there losing money on the assumption the business will grow is just throwing money away.",

I rely most of my business to come from social media and betting on posts to become viral but i stopped paying for promotions to save money short term (which isnt the right thing to do.) I will start ramping up the promotions but ill see how sales will go regardless on if im losing money or not. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to add?",

They run a martial arts company and another a wine tasting company. When you run the promotions try and figure out what business you get from it and how profitable it is. Then you can see what return you get on your investment, if you're not making money from paying for social media promotions don't do them or at least change your strategy.\n\nDon't get dragged into one of those toxic positivity, motivational or entrepreneurial mindsets. Even if you love your business and it's what you want to do you can only keep running it if it makes money. Embrace being critical and strategic with your thinking.  Ignore the \"youre an entreprener this is how youre supposed to feel and it should make or brake you plus youre in a good fiancial situation\u201d advice. It's bull shit and you know it. Your business needs to start making money or you can't keep running no amount of entrepreneurial sprit and positive thinking can change that fact.",

I\u2019ve tracked ROI on the promos and its a net loss but im betting on the exposure long term.. Otherwise im sure look back at your responses from time to time as my lease ends in a year. Much love, thank you",

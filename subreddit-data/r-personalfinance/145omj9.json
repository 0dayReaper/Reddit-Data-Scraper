Anything I can do to get the tax benefits I\u2019d normally get from 401k contributions?\n\nTIA!",

On the bright side, 1/2 of it i~~s deductible~~ **can be used as an adjustment** on the 1040.\n\nThere's a difference here, because deductible is typically for itemized deductions or business expenses. An adjustment will reduce your AGI (Adjusted Gross Income).",

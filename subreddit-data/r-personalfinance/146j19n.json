I\u2019m concerned that my mother could transfer my earnings to another account, preventing me from accessing the money. \n\nI want to know if it\u2019s possible to withdraw all of my money at and put it in another bank account to keep it safe or if there\u2019s anything I can do. This money can make or break my plans to leave, Any tips are appreciated!",

Pick anything and you can always move it again to something better. For now it\u2019s about separating from the joint. \n\nUnder 18 his hands are tired unless knows another dependable adult. \n\nPersonally I\u2019d take out all of my money and keep it out of the banks until you\u2019re 18.

One day she wants to take me shopping, going to buy me shoes or somesuch.  Ok fine.  We get to the shopping mall and she needs to go to the bank first.  As soon as we get to the teller's window, she's now requesting the teller to pull up my account and provide a balance.  I'm like \"hell no, this isn't happening.\"  She starts telling the woman she's my mother, our names, we used to have a joint account and she needs to see my new account details.  I'm telling her I'm not giving her permission to access my account, and the teller isn't going to help her.\n\nThe *teller* then pipes in with \"Ok, so I have the details up, what did you need to know?\"  \n\nI straight up lost my shit, and told the teller I *very explicitly* just stated I *DID NOT* want my manipulative and invasive mother to know *anything* about my account, what the actual *fuck* did she think she was doing, and if she gave my mother one single scrap of information about my account, I'd make damn sure she was fired.  I spoke to the manager to have a notation on my account (that the manager assured me wasn't necessary because no teller will give out details to anyone who isn't the account holder *despite a teller literally minutes earlier nearly doing exactly that)* that under no circumstances was [mother's name] to be allowed information regarding the account.  Ended up pulling my funds and opening an account with a different bank because I just couldn't trust that my mother wouldn't talk her way around the next teller.\n\nTL:DR - Despite bank policies, manipulative people can and will talk their way around some people, I personally have no faith an account with the same bank is secure from determined immediate family.",

Specifically his two daughters. Who I could tell by the birthdates provided were both over 18. It was no problem. No prescriptions to pick up. So I wonder what he thought he even knew that made him check. I just assumed the worst and it made me cringe.\n\nPharmacies always surprise me though. With all the HIPAA stuff everywhere else in medicine, it makes no sense to me. Like, I can always just walk in and pick up my wife's stuff. Absolutely no problem. No documentation I need to provide or anything. We even have different last names. I just give a birthdate and name and I can pay and walk out with it. Blows my mind.",

Especially if the minimum balance is low, you might want to leave that in there to avoid dealing with the penalties.\n\nI'd be a little worried about trying to open a new account online and transfer the money. That might work absolutely fine, but sometimes there is a waiting period of a few days to get those connections setup for a new account, and it sounds like that timeline may not be appropriate.\n\nOne option to consider is to go to the bank and ask for a cashier's check payable to yourself. There may be a fee for this (you can ask!) but it's perfectly normal to do. You can then walk that check straight over to another bank to deposit. (It does mean you're walking around with a very valuable and irreplaceable piece of paper, though.)",

But I worked back office for a credit union for several years, most of that being the person primarily responsible for ETF processing.\n\nA stop payment can absolutely be placed on a cashier's check within 90 days.  A cashier's check is not guaranteed funds, that would be a certified check. You are correct regarding the funds being pulled from the personal account into an internal general ledger account, but the depositing institution will still place a hold on the funds because the funds are not guaranteed. And that's because, yes, a stop payment can be placed on outstanding cashier's checks. I personally processed multiple stop payment orders on cashier's checks and money orders; the process is different from stop payments on personal checks, but we can verify on the spot whether the check has cleared. If it has not cleared, we can place a stop payment and if/when the check comes in, it will be returned as payment stopped.\n\nAgain, fully understand that rules can be different at different institutions; but where I worked, this is how we operated. A member can walk into any branch, or call, and request a stop payment be placed on a cashier's check. We can verify the check was created via withdrawal from their account, they pay the stop payment fee, and place a stop payment on the account in our system. They could do this same day, if they wanted to (usually due to lost/stolen).\n\nEdit to add: Yes, a dispute can be filed on cashier's checks. If a member issued a cashier's check and it cleared but the member did not get credit, we had the power to return the item and credit the member back. Again, lengthier process, but absolutely possible.",

I work very closely with our various payment operations departments on a daily basis.\n\nWhat you are saying is technically correct, but those scenarios are only for extenuating circumstances like a processing error at one of the institutions or verified fraud. OP isn't going to have to worry about a fraud claim, and the likelihood of a processing error resulting in the need to put a stop payment on an outstanding check is so close to zero that it isn't worth giving OP the anxiety that it might even happen.\n\nAnd yes, cashier's checks are most certainly guaranteed. They're signed by the institution, while certified checks are signed by the customer. This is why Reg CC mandates the first 5525 be released even when a 9 day new account hold would apply.\n\n&gt;where I worked, this is how we operated. A member can walk into any branch, or call, and request a stop payment be placed on a cashier's check. We can verify the check was created via withdrawal from their account, they pay the stop payment fee, and place a stop payment on the account in our system. They could do this same day, if they wanted to (usually due to lost/stolen).\n\nIt has been a long time since I've worked in the branch and had to do compliance training for that, but IIRC that scenario would be out of compliance until after 90 days for a cashier's check. It might be like Reg D where the institution can choose not to enforce it. Unless a BofA employee chimes in otherwise, I'm going to believe their branch and call center staff don't have the ability to put a stop on a cashier's check, only mark it requested for review and processing to the back office department responsible for it, and that BofA would not allow an early stop payment.",

I strongly second the recommendations that you move it to an entirely different bank, but I'll add a few tips on *how* to do that...\n\nPlan to withdraw your funds and open your new account all in the same day. Walk into your current bank and withdraw cash or a cashier's check in your name. Even if you don't already have your new account, take that straight to your preferred new bank. Note that for many banks in the US, if you walk in personally with proper ID, you only have to be over 13 years old to open an account by yourself (check the rules for the particular bank you choose). Besides the speed, an advantage of withdrawing cash from the current account is that it cannot be reversed, whereas there's a chance an ACH transfer could be if your mother claims fraud.\n\nEven if you're sure all the money in the current account is yours, consider leaving the minimum amount necessary to avoid fees. If the account falls below that level, the bank may automatically alert all the account holders, which means your mother would find out right away. Plus, she could claim you're responsible for those fees. Losing the minimum balance amount might be worth saving yourself the hassle of added conflict.\n\nGood luck!",

My father and stepmother drained my account days before my 18th birthday claiming (to only me and my mother) that the almost 20k was for their expenses for raising me the times they had custody. If your parents are worrying you, protect yourself and your assets before they are no longer yours. My parents pulled that out and left me sleeping on park benches and couches for several months while I worked multiple jobs through my last year of highschool. I know not everyone has to distrust their family, but some folks have these situations, and if that's you, the. It's up to you and only you to protect yourself.",

    "postText": "help! \n\ni opened my very first and only credit card 18 months ago, and i have been using it sparingly and for emergencies all while making the minimum (if not slightly over minimum) payment every month. i don\u2019t have a very high limit, but i have almost reached it and the interest kicks in this month and i completely didn\u2019t realize it. \n\nmy job does not pay me enough for all my other bills plus the interest i\u2019m about to deal with. i have been actively looking for a second job for the last month or so, long before i realized the bit about the interest. \n\nwhat can i do? i\u2019ve tried raising the limit temporarily until i can pay it off in full but it won\u2019t budge. i\u2019ve been denied a personal loan.\n\nhas anyone had experience with balance transfers or getting themselves out of similar situations? i don\u2019t have anyone else to ask as my parents are terrible with money and everyone else is smarter than to let themselves be put in a similar situation as me.\n\ni don\u2019t have enough to pay it off in full or make a payment including the interest in it. i live paycheck to paycheck right now, i didn\u2019t when i opened the card.\n\ni\u2019m trying to tie loose ends and lower other monthly payments such as my car payment and car insurance.",

Unless you are able to increase your income(either with a second job or gig work or selling stuff on eBay, etc), that means slashing your spending.\n\nAlso, I would recommend that you completely stop using the card for anything and cut it up. Since you weren't aware that interest was going to begin to accrue, you should avoid credit cards entirely until you have a better understanding of financial matters. You can always open a different card later once tour finances are in order.",

Refinancing and loan consolidation may not be available to you at this time.\n\nTry using either the Avalanche or the Snowball method to bring down your debt. There are YouTube videos that have extensive information on these two methods. Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors.\n\nIn the future, use only no annual fee credit cards that offer points or cash back. Use them only for essential items. ALWAYS pay off the balance every month and you should be good building up your credit history. Stay disciplined and live within your means.",

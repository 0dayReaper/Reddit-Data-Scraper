    "postText": "Hey all, literally just found this sub so excuse me if I\u2019m doing anything wrong. \n\nLong story short, my mom hijacked my credit as soon as I was 18. Maxed out some credit cards, left me with $5000+ in collections, and put me on a mortgage she failed to pay. And I\u2019m only 21 now, so I haven\u2019t had much time to dig myself out of that grave. Sitting at about 600 credit. \n\nHowever, being a dumb 19 year old, I went and got a decent car. 2018, $30k+ loan with $1750 down. Monthly payment is $640, with 18% interest. And believe it or not, I signed on making $12/hr. \n\nNow, I have an apartment and other life concerns. I make decent money. About $50k, with a promotion coming soon that will double it. However, I just want out of this. $640 every month is a lot, with rent and insurance and everything. I haven\u2019t been able to pay on time in months, but have been able to pay within 30 days. I just want the car gone, but I still need a decent car for my job. \n\nMy 20 day payoff is ~$25k. A few dealers and KBB have valued it between $14-16k in its current condition\u2026 so I can\u2019t just sell it and wait to get a beater. So I was thinking of just trading for a $15k car, and hoping they either will finance my negative equity or something. I only have $1000 in my savings. But I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s even a thing. What is my best bet to get rid of this? My biggest goal is to get out of this car, and get down to a $10-15k loan that I can throw extra money at when I get promoted. Get it paid off within a year or two, and just save money as much as I can.",

If so, this is fraud and you're gonna have to 1) report to the police and 2) report the fraud to your creditors and provide the police report. \n\nIf fraud truly did occur, then the steps above should be taken... it will help get you off the hook for debt that you never took out. Your credit will be better.\n\n&gt;My 20 day payoff is ~$25k.

The LTV (loan to value of car) once you roll in the negative equity will be way too high (~166%).\n\nGiven your credit situation, you're gonna have a tough time easily getting out of this. You're gonna have to do a combo of a few things. 1) Pay down the debt as quickly as possible, making extra payments towards the principal. 2) You should raise income/cut expenses to free up cash to make extra payments. 3) Look into KBB for private party sale, as you'll get more back than selling to a dealer.",

And they always pay the best price in my experience, they don't fuck around with negotiating, the computer tells them what to pay, that's what they pay, and it's more than fair, especially if they let you roll the negative equity into your new note.   And I am a lot older than you so it's only natural that I would earn a good chunk more than you do, and in 23 years I have never bought a car with a sticker price over 22.5.  Acura TL Type S, BMW340I, two loaded Tundras, and I focus on older cars with 1 owner and 100k or less on them, and 1 owner is key and can always be found, because if the 1st owner sold it at 80k, and the buyer just sold it at 100k, why did he bail after only 20k?  And I don't want to have to wonder about unknowable shit like that.  And in your situation with negative equity I would buy a 10k Corolla, miles almost don't matter, and the nice thing about Toyota's is you can call any dealer with the VIN and if it has ever been dealer serviced they can look it up nationwide.  And not everyone goes to the dealer, but smart Toyota owners do, because it is a myth that they are always the most expensive, because they measure how long a task will take down to the minute, so if takes 18 minutes then you pay for 18 minutes of tech. time, they don't round up.  A lot of people just ignore service intervals, and then they're surprised when a bunch of shit breaks all at once, and by then the repair cost is out of reach, well out of reach in a lot of cases, so a lot of times they have no choice but to just trade it in.  And you might get away with doing it again, but after that nobody will take your car on trade because you are going to be so far underwater they won't touch it.  And your next stop is most likely going to be bankruptcy court, because the interest will go up every time you do this, and before long you are past the tipping point and there is just no way you will ever pay it off, so if you continue to pay it you are literally throwing your money away, because it won't make any difference in the outcome.  And 7 years is plenty of time to rebuild your credit, and it happens faster than most people think, because as Kevin O'Leary on Shark Tank said, \"The system is designed to separate you from your money.\"  So the system wants you out there spending again, not stuck in 500 credit score hell.   But if you made 7 years of payments on a car you're going to lose anyway just think of how much money that is and it's a no brainer.  But until then, Carmax is your best bet.",

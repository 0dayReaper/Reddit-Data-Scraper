    "postText": "Im 25. Recently got a promotion and have extra income. Im getting pretty comfortable and want to take my investment portfolio more seriously. I want to get out of robinhood and move to another platform. Im thinking of making reoccurring investments (probably monthly, maybe biweekly depending if apps have an auto investing feature) into a diverse range of stocks/funds (dividend, gross, ETF\u2019s). From what Ive been reading, people seem to generally think I couldnt go wrong with vanguard or fidelity as a platform. Ill do more research into each later today, but wanted to hear what everyones opinions/experiences/recommendations are with them or maybe a different platform.",

Well, you might want to go with Fidelity because Vanguard doesn't offer that.\n\nOr you already have checking and a HYSA with [Ally.com](https://Ally.com) and a CD ladder there, so is having your Roth on a second platform better than Ally because all you ever choose is VTI+VXUS as your portfolio?  Ally's UI is maybe more appealing than others and the charge for transactions is no different, so why complicate things?\n\nIt's really up to you what appeals.",

I do want to raise one point that at Fidelity, you can choose a money market fund as your core position (where your uninvested cash stays) and current yield is high 4.x%. This way, you will stay assured that none of your money is idle. I don't know Vanguard or Schwab but assume they do the same. Some brokers (eg Merrill Lynch) do not have this, and the yield on their core position is low. You have to explicitly buy into high yield fund and sell it when you want the money to invest other things. This make a big difference in the long run.",

I recently made the decision to consolidate at Fidelity and use them for checking, savings, taxable brokerage, Roth IRA, solo 401K, HSA, 529 plan and 2% cashback Visa card.  In contrast Schwab lacks a HSA and 2% Visa.  Another plus for Fidelity is they also auto sweep uninvested cash into SPAXX in their brokerage accounts whereas with Schwab you have to manually buy it.  Furthermore Fidelity will auto-sells your MMFs when there is not enough cash whereas you have to manually do that at Schwab, though you could use margin if you overdraft.  Fidelity also let\u2019s you buy fractional shares on any equity whereas you\u2019re limited to only the S&amp;P 500 as Schwab.  Since I like to buy ETFs in my taxable brokerage Fidelity made more sense.\n\nI will say that I think Schwab\u2019s website and app are better and their customer support is stellar.  I also like that I can easily cancel auto-roll CDs and T-Bills at Schwab at anytime whereas I think you have to wait until they are about to mature at Fidelity.",

    "postText": "Weird thing happened to me recently...\n\nI received a call from visa asking if I had recently made some large purchases . I replied \"no I haven't \". \n\n\n**The charges:**\n\n\n$5000 ( triggered fraud alert)\n\n\n$800 (went through, iPhone on contract maybe?)\n\n\n$800 (went through)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bank then told me someone just called them pretending to be me and my card was compromised.\n\nA week later I get two packages in the mail. I open them up, Two 256gb iPhone X's. One silver, one black.\n\n**I'm guessing this is what happened:**\n\n1) The fraudsters were testing the waters with the iPhones before they made the big purchase.\n\n2) They were hoping to intercept the package .\n\n3) They just messed up.\n\n\n\nAnyone have this happen to them? \n\n**Edit :**\n\n- Yes the charges were reversed.\n\n- I still have the phones\n\n- I'm going to contact visa about what to do.\n\n- I don't have kids \n\n- Not on any medications / wasn't drunk \n\n- Getting a lot of messages about people wanting to buy them. Im going to try and return them. They're not for sale :P \n\n- I don't need legal troubles. I highly doubt they won't come looking for these phones. \n\n- My apartment doesn't have gas. (carbon monoxide poisoning)\n\n- What the frick?\n\n\n\n**Wow front page! , Thanks everyone for all of the responses. Helps a ton!**\n\n\n**Update 3:00pm PST:** Talked with visa &amp; credit security agent. They told me they don't deal with the packages / returns and that I should contact the merchant/cell phone provider. I am going to be contacting the credit bureau in the morning as well.\n \n\n**Update 4:00pm PST:** Currently on the phone with cell phone provider. Closing any accounts the fraudsters may have opened.\n\n\n**Update 4:30pm PST:** Talked to the cell phone provider. No account was created under my name and they can't trace this purchase to me because I don't have an account. They told me I should just wait and see if they contact me again. They said they can't accept any returns because I need an account number (which i don't have).\n\n**Update 5:00pm PST:** Just realized something... the address it was sent to is a number off. My address ends in a 2, the slip ends in a 4. It does have my name on it etc. It got to my house because the delivery guys know our last name most likely. The plot thickens. I do have new neighbours , but I don't think they could pull this off. Super strange. \n\n**Update 6:00pm PST:** Just checked, the address ending in 4 isn't the new neighbours, they're my other neighbours, and they're pretty old.  I don't think I'm going to get much more info on this. I'm thinking I'll wait for a while before I consider the phones mine. I don't want to open it and then get charged for it. They may even be deactivated from Apples side anyways. I'll open one after one month. \n \n**Update 6:17pm PST:** Proof https://imgur.com/a/lVKWF\n\n**Update (next day) 12:20pm PST:** \nI just called credit bureaus. The fraudsters tried to make cell phone accounts in my name. For some reason the cell phone provider couldn't find my name on file.  It's officially identity fraud at this point, and there will be an investigation. If anyone is in Canada and this has happened to you, please call your bank as well as the following numbers.\n\n**Equifax**\n\n1-866-205-0681\n\n**Trans Union**\n\n1-800-663-9980\n\n**Canadian Anti Fraud Centre**\n\n1-888-495-8501\n\n\nFunny thing just happened. Trans union gave me the Canadian anti fraud number, and I mistyped it. I typed 800 instead of 888 and it went to a sex line. For a second I thought I had been elaborately scammed and all of the people were it on it, then I realized the mistake. \n\n\n\n\n\n*As crappy as this situation is for my identity. Reddit has made it pretty fun. Thanks again*\n\n",

            "comment": "I work at a Hotel and we frequently receive packages for guests. Recently, starting in 2017, these packages for guests were picking up their packages then canceling their reservation. We wised up and required a check-in for all packages.\n\nThis continued until after black Friday when we received three packages, all the same type of box, for three different people, all made their reservation for the same day. That's a little weird. We were contacted by the state police because one of the packages was for him.\n\nApparently someone stole the police man's credit card and ordered this package, an iPhone X, then got it delivered to the Hotel and made a reservation to pick it up. This someone would also have a fake ID to provide at check-in.\n\nWhen we told him there were two others, it made things really interesting for a police investigation. The state police came by and picked up the packages, and Fed-Ex, also aware of the scam, came by to pick up the packages, but we told them we didn't have access to the packages.\n\nThe plan was to let the three reservations check-in and have the police arrest them for fraud. They never checked-in.",

First we get an email confirming her reservation for a hotel in Indianapolis on her Hiton Honors account.  She called the hotel and asked about it - but they didn't seem too bothered - we figured someone just keyed in their Honors number incorrectly.  A few days later she received an email receipt for the stay.  We laughed it off.\n\nThen - a week or two later - she gets an email from ATT confirming her order for an iPhone X - scheduled to be delivered to a Doubletree (Hilton) in Roswell, GA.  She chased it with ATT fraud division and was able to get the orders canceled.  As best as we can tell, they did not use her credit card or account to pay for it.  \n\nShe also filed a report with both our local city (also ATL metro area) and Roswell.  One of the cops told her the same thing had happened to him and he went over to try and catch the person. ",

I too got around a 1000 spam emails.  Bestbuy was pathetic in helping in stopping the package,  i called them even before the order was shipped,  they said they can't cancel the order because the system doesn't allow it, how can a system be built without having an option to cancel even for the customer service representative.  They said i don't have to worry and but guess what the package was out for delivery to fraudster's address and i had to push bestbuy to call fedex to intercept the package. They could have just stopped the shipping of the package in their warehouse itself. \n\nFew things i couldn't understand \n1. How did fraudster got hold of my email and password \n2. Why i received so many spam emails, maybe they had a script to run against every website to check if that password worked or maybe to throw you off track so that you don't read the order email if your order email was buried between those spam emails ?\n3. Fraudster ordered the phone to a address in the same city , i did looked the address using google earth and area seemed to be decent neighborhood.  ",

Also I'm pretty sure Apple has insurance that covers these sorts of things from their end so the two phones have already been written off.",

He called Dell to tell them 'yeah, just send me some return shipping labels', they said they would but never did, so 8 months later, we sold 2 of them for $1000 each and he kept one.\n\nAnother one which is my favorite: I was contracted to install all the computers &amp; POS systems for a fitness company. They needed me to hire out 7 other techs to assist. Took me a while, but I found them eventually, and we were lined up for the work. I get a shipment of ALL sorts of things, computers, scanners, cameras.....it took up an entire room in my house for over a month.\n\nA week before the job, I called just to confirm the time that they wanted it installed, and they said 'oh, yeah.....we went with another vendor - please mail back the equipment we sent'......I said 'nope, but if you want to send someone to pick it up, its obviously yours, but i am not carrying any of it anywhere.'\n\nNobody ever came, so I sold it for lets just say a lot of money.",

You'll want to figure out what there process is for reclaiming goods from the vendor and get proof that those phones made it back to them when the time comes. \n\nThe whole thing sounds like a pain in the ass though.

When they came, they accidentally filled it full, then billed me for 150 extra gallons. I told them no, I had no intention of paying for that, and that I couldn't, and to come take it back.

Spoke to merchant account bank fraud center and they do not investigate under a certain dollar amount. Thieves know this and order just under the threshold. The merchant loses every time. Fraud center person then told me how he just dealt with a merchant that that got charge backed about $30,000 spanning multiple smaller dollar orders. He said likely it will put the merchant out of business. I felt relieved we only lost $50.00 but I feel terrible for those that lose so much more.",

So you give them back to UPS thinking you're done and they end up with the phones.  \n\nMake sure the keep a copy of any return labels.  I work for UPS, if it goes through us there is a detachable piece at the bottom of call tags that has a copy of the tracking # and some other info.  At least that way if it goes missing you can use the tracking # to find out where it was delivered.  ",

If they reverse the charges, whoever sold the iPhone is going to come after their money. If your credit card is eating the cost, they may want the merchandise.\n\nI don't know exactly how it is supposed to work, but I would call your credit card company and ask, and then get the next step in writing (either explicit permission to keep them or instructions on returning). If you are returning, try to get your credit card to pay for shipping (shipping label?) and make sure the packages are tracked and insured.",

They can direct you from there on how to secure your information.\n\nOdds are the fraudster either A.) intended to intercept the package. B.) used your correct address so the purchase looked legit, then were going to plan to change the address either with UPS or the vendor later on. C.) the merchant contacted the bank and the bank provided a change of address (from fraud address to legit address).

The weird part is the postal code was wrong and the street address was our address except translated into french and the return address was a jumbled mess of symbols.  We couldn't get ahold of who ever sent it so we just kept it, it was a weird vacuum coffee maker.  It makes good coffee but is a bitch to clean so maybe it was a curse.",

After that, they went to the gas station and spent over $180. My credit union didn't want to refund anything because it was local. I had a ton of overdrafts. Had to file a police report. It was way more difficult than it needed to be. ",

Ordered two Microsoft surface tablets to my house, then attempted to order 9 more sent to a different address. Credit card company caught the second transaction and called me, cancelling both, but the order for the two to my house still showed up. They are trying to avoid detection by the merchants who will not generally let you ship your first order to a different address than your billing address for something that large, but the second one can go through.",

We called the bank and disputed it, and they reversed the charge and sent us a new card - not a huge deal, Chase has a great fraud team and we got the new card maybe a week later.\n\nA few days after we disputed the charge, though, we got a package delivered...addressed to someone with a very Thai-sounding name but our mailing address, containing a pair of very nice Adidas sneakers. According to the receipt, we only received part of what he\u2019d purchased (the amount we disputed was for more like three pairs of shoes at that price).\n\nCalled Adidas customer service, explained the situation, asked if we could return the shoes - not for a refund, we\u2019d gotten that, just because they\u2019re technically stolen, and also too small for either of us to wear. The rep told us that there was no need to return them, that the fact that it was fraud meant the loss was already covered by the company, so we could give them away if we wanted. Gave them to a friend to give to her tween nephew; he got some very flashy sneakers for his birthday. It was super weird, though, that Fraud Guy had part of his shoe order sent to us.",

I hopped online and sure enough dude spent 700 dollars on a phone. Now this is the fun part, this guy called the next day and tried to say the phone he ordered got sent to our house. My hubby took the call, but said I think you need to talk to my wife. I let him know he was full of shit, and we were keeping the phone. He got mad, and we laughed at him. Got our accounts locked down, and I sold the phone to my dad. Worked out well for us thankfully. \n\nEdit: The company that sold the phone wouldn\u2019t refund until we sent the phone back, our credit union wanted us to hang on to it. So my dad just said he would buy it from us and that was it. ",

(Our credit card company was a huge help in this and made the whole situation disappear)\n\nThey also ordered stuff from amazon. (It was around Christmas so it may have been multiple people stealing out identity? Not really sure) But either way they ordered a GoPro kit with a bunch of accessories. Around $650. A few weeks go by and the whole situation is behind us we wont be charged anything and we get new cards and what not. We get an email for shipping confirmation of the GoPro. That day another email replies to that email and we see it too from what has to be assumed as the person who stole our identity. They were asking the shipping address be changed. We realized the order was still shipping to our home address and the company replied saying they cannot do that. We were told not to worry about the whole situation by the credit card company. \n\nFast forward and the darn thing actually shows up. We contact the card company and they tell us basically it is ours that they handled it. So lucky kid me I got a free Go Pro because someone stole our credit card. \n\nMaybe another month after that Amazon suspended our account. It took us forever to get our account back but eventually the issue was solved and I live on with a Go Pro. Still feel kinda guilty that I got this thing for free.",

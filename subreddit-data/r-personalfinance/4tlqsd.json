    "postText": "Yes, it's me....back with a second installment in our series, ELI22.  This assumes you read [ELI18](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tfc76/eli18_personal_finance_tips_for_young_adults_us/) ( even the links...you'll learn 10X more from the links!) and have done  things pertaining to your situation.  \n\nThe \"22\" here  means you're done with full-time education, have a career with meaningful income, and are responsible for your own support.  Some people start this at 18, some at 26; age is not important.  Specifics pertain to the US in some cases.  This assumes you are a single childless renter employee; [ELI30](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4uoycd/eli30_personal_finance_tips_for_thirtysomething/) will cover marriage, home ownership, and children.\n\nYou have money now, congratulations!  Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) excellent summary of how to handle it.  Here's a [ginormous flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/1rPEkGQ.png) showing what to do first: bills? loans?  investments?  Good self-study!  We'll highlight three Big Ideas to get you started.\n\n- **Taxes**. Your employee income is taxed / withheld like so: 7.5% of the first $118K goes to [social security/medicare taxes](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc751.html). (We hope you will benefit in the future, too!)  Then your income is taxed at [higher rates](http://taxfoundation.org/article/2016-tax-brackets) as you make more.  Assuming no special deductions, 0% for the first 10K due to standardish deductions.  Then 10% of the next 9K, 15% of the next 28K, and then 25% tax rate kicks in; this is your rate from 48K  to 102K gross income, so a popular rate.  (It's only 28% up to 200K, as well.)  This is your tax bracket / marginal tax rate.  (Most states also have state income taxes of ~6%ish but they vary a lot.)  Higher brackets only affect your additional income; [you always come out ahead](http://blog.taxact.com/how-tax-brackets-work/) even if more income means a new top tax bracket.   You reduce your taxes with credits and [deductions](http://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/personal-income-taxes/tax-deductions.htm).  Big Idea 1 is: [reduce your current taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes) by making less of your income  taxable.\n\n- **Debt**.  You borrow money now so you can spend it, yay!  But then you have to pay it back, and typically pay back more than you borrowed, boo!  You've lost money as a result.  The extra amount you repay is determined by the [interest rate](http://banking.about.com/od/loans/a/Calculate-Interest-You-Pay.htm); the annual rate is called APR.  \n3% APR student loan?  You'll pay $30 annual interest on $1000.  Not bad.  \n12% APR car loan?  You'll pay $120.  Not good.  \n  23.9% APR credit card?  You'll pay $239.  Yikes!  (Never do this!)\nYou repay the money you borrowed, too; that's called principal.  The longer you take to repay the loan,  the smaller each payment, but the more interest you'll then pay.  It's a tradeoff.  Big Idea 2 is: [reduce the amount of interest you pay](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt) by getting lower interest rates, and avoiding / quickly repaying higher interest debt.\n\n- **Investing**.  In ELI18, I noted bank interest won't make you rich.  The good news in ELI22 is: investments can make you  [current millionaire rich](http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/save-million-calculator.aspx).  The catch is: it takes decades, and you must regularly invest significant sums.  This why you start at 22!  The ELI22  introduction to investments is based on the [Target Date Fund](http://www.finra.org/investors/target-date-funds-find-right-target-you), wherein you buy shares of a mostly stock-based index  fund  designed to be worth a lot more when you retire at a target date 40+ years in the future.  Historically, these accounts gain about [6% annually](http://www.thesimpledollar.com/where-does-7-come-from-when-it-comes-to-long-term-stock-returns/) after inflation, though it varies significantly year to year.  Your money doubles every 12 years, and goes up by 10X in 40 years.  (All numbers are  after taking inflation into account.)  So that $5000 you put aside at 22 could easily be worth $50,000 of today's dollars at 65.  (But, there could be years where you temporarily [lose 10%, 20%, even 30%](http://www.finra.org/investors/reality-investment-risk) of your savings.  Do not panic!  It will come back eventually.)  Big Idea 3 is: invest early and often for your future, especially your retirement.  \n\nGot the the Big Ideas now?   Good!  Let's see how we combine them for some meaningful benefits for your ~22-year-old self.\n\n- Retirement contributions. You are going to retire someday.  Invest and perhaps reduce current taxes by letting your employer contribute a percent of each paycheck to your [401k account](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k) (or similar things with different names for government employers).  A recommended investment percentage is 10%, but it's up to you; more is better, the annual maximum is $18,000.  The cardinal rule is [Take The Match](https://www.smart401k.com/resource-center/retirement-investing-basics/company-match) if you have one.  A typical employer adds 3% of your salary when you contribute 6%, so that's like Free Money.  Take The Match.  (Your actual match depends on your employer's rules.) The  money is invested for you, available penalty-free when you retire after age 59.5 (usually.)  If you change jobs, the money can go  with you.  A 401k can only invest in what your employer offers.   Most employers have target date funds, so choosing one is an easy decision.  If you need or want to, you can sometimes achieve an  even better result by picking other available choices.\n\n- \"What do you mean 'perhaps reduce current taxes'?\"  Retirement savings are wery wery complicated.  (Thank your  congresspeople.) A \"traditional\" 401k reduces your current taxes because it exempts your contributions from your taxable income.  You pay taxes when you take the money out, deferring the taxes, but you still pay something.  If you would prefer, you can reverse this if your employer offers a \"Roth\" option.  In that case, you pax taxes on your 401k contributions , but no taxes when you take the money out.  The best [choice](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional) is complex; for those below the 25% bracket, Roth is usually better.  \n\n- Yet more retirement options: IRAs.  [Individual Retirement Accounts](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/iras) are do-it-yourself 401ks.  You set up an account with a company like Vanguard, Schwab or Fidelity, and give them up to $5500 annually to invest for you.   You have more investment choices, target date funds plus other options.   Depending on your income level and whether you have an employer 401k, you open a traditional or Roth IRA, with tax treatment equivalent to the previously described 401k types.  IRAs are your go-to option if you have no employer 401k, but you still may (and even should) want to use an IRA, especially a Roth IRA, even if you have one.  You can  tap IRA and  401k resources before retirement for certain allowable reasons, though it's not usually recommended because you lose future gains and might owe current taxes.  A Roth IRA is the best choice for raidable retirement savings because contributions can be taken out at any time without taxes or penalties.\n\nOK.  That was a lot of information!  Ready to repay [student loans](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/studentloans)?  Let's find out:  \n\n-  If you do have student loans, the interest rate clock is ticking.  Loans are typically 10 year repayment, so you'll owe about 1% of the loan balance each month for ten years.   \nIf you owe $20,000, that's $200/month.  Like a car payment.  Not terrible.   \nIf you owe $100,000, that will be $1000/month.  Like a mortgage payment, only without the house.  Not fun to pay.  \nYou have to pay these back unless you get them forgiven.  You have [several approaches](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans) available for repayment:\n\n- Pay them back on schedule.  It sounds crazy, but it just might work!   If your income supports it, pay the minimum on low-interest (&lt;~4%) loans.  If you have even more income, repay them faster with extra payments, especially on higher interest loans,  and save by paying less interest than you would over time.  This is your primary option on private loans.   If you have high-interest private loans, look into [refinancing](https://studentloanhero.com/refinance-and-consolidate-student-loans-0042/) them; if you have good income and credit, you'll qualify for lower interest rates.  \n\n- If you have a lot of federal loans but  little income, look into [reduced payment plans](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven) like Income-Based Repayment (IBR) and Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) plans.  You'll pay less (even nothing) each month, based on your current income, but you'll pay longer, and ultimately pay more over time in many cases.  \n\n- If you are really in a deep hole, maybe over $100K federal with only $40K annual income, give a special look into [Public Service Loan Forgiveness](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service) (PSLF).  This program allows you to work for ten years in public service, make minimal payments, then your unpaid balance is magically forgiven, which is a really sweet deal if you can get it.  (This differs from forgiveness programs for IBR/PAYE that will charge you taxes on any amount forgiven in the future.)\n\nEnough about  student loans.  Let's wrap up with a few other topics of general interest to 22 year olds:\n\n- Grad school can be a good idea, but can also be a very expensive idea.  If you are sure this is for you, try to get someone else to pay for it, whether the school via scholarships / stipends, or your employer, if they do education reimbursement.  Med school is worth the money no matter who pays.   Law school and MBA return on investment is iffier these days.  Going to grad school because you are not sure what else to do is probably a big mistake, especially so if you have to pay for it.\n\n- You may be responsible for your [health insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance).  (You could be on your parents' plan until age 26 in many cases, though that may cost them something.) If your employer will pay for it, that's your best option.  They may offer a lower-premium [High Deductible Health Plan](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2014/11/10/should-you-roll-the-dice-on-a-high-deductible-health-plan) (HDHP), where you pay routine costs, but insurance kicks in for major expenses.  This is a good choice if you have good health and make few claims.  You  should take advantage of a [Healthcare Savings Account](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/health/what-is-an-hsa/) (HSA) with an HDHP.  This lets you deduct contributions to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses, with  other unique features that make them attractive.  You can contribute $3350 annually to your HSA.  Some employers pay some of this for you as more free money.   \n\n- If your employer doesn't offer health insurance and you can't use your parents' plan, you'll want to get an individual plan such as those found on [healthcare.gov](http://healthcare.gov).  You can only sign up at certain times, including open enrollment  in November / December.  If you don't have health insurance of some form, you could [pay a penalty](https://www.healthcare.gov/fees/fee-for-not-being-covered/) of up to ~$2000 at tax time, unless you have an [exemption](https://www.healthcare.gov/health-coverage-exemptions/exemptions-from-the-fee/).  \n\n- With more income, you can rent a nicer place within the same 30% of takehome guideline.  You may not even want a roommate!  Of course, any money you spend on housing is money you don't have for other things.  Living with your parents is still a viable option if you want to save, e.g. to pay down student loans.   Please make sure you have renter's insurance, it's well worth the small cost.   (Note that we assume you are not yet ready to buy a house; you may not yet be sure where you  want to live long-term, have limited work history, or have insufficient down payment.) \n\n- You can also afford a nicer car, since you have better credit, and  lower insurance rates.  (You don't have to upgrade your car, and you'll save money if you don't.)  Paying cash is still an option, but if you qualify for a 2% car loan, consider taking it to free your money for purposes like retirement investments and loan repayments.  A good target price is perhaps $15K, with a $10K loan, which works out to 4 years at $220/month.  Your total cost-of-car would be about $5K annually.  Selling your old car privately should get you 20% more than you would by trading it in to a dealer.  \n\n- With more expenses, budgeting becomes much more important.  You'll want to have a bigger emergency fund; we recommend at least three months' expenses, to cover that bad day when you lose your job and your car breaks.   With more expenses to track, look into a program like [You Need a Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (ynab) or [Mint](https://www.mint.com/) to help keep track of where your money is, and where it needs to be in the future.  Look for ways to economize where you can, whether by cheaper cell-phone plans, learning to cook so you want to eat at home, or taking advantage of employee discounts.  \n\n- While you don't have a lot of tax deductions yet outside of retirement / HSA savings, take a look at possible [tax breaks](http://blogs.hrblock.com/2013/04/08/twenty-somethings-dont-overlook-these-tax-deductions/) for student loan interest, moving expenses associated with a job change, and certain tuition expenses ([American Opportunity Tax Credit](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/aotc)).  You don't have to itemize to take advantage of these, but income limits apply in some cases.\n\nWhew!  That was a long one.  I think that does it for this week.

And even if you're overfunding your account and have already maxed out all other tax-advantaged investment vehicles, whole life *probably* has no advantages over buying term life and investing on your own.\n\nWhole life (outside of overfunding tax advantages) isn't anything special - it's literally backed by term life. The reason your fees go up as you get older is because your term life is getting more expensive. You would be better off in nearly all situations buying term life for your entire life and investing in a low-fee index fund with the remainder. Your family would be equally secure and you'd have even *more* money saved away.",

I'm 28 and have enough life insurance to pay off my loans, put me in the ground with a wake and funeral (stupid expensive btw), with enough left over to put my little bro through grad school and pay off a chunk of my parents mortgage. It costs pennies because I got it when I was 23 and in great shape. Life insurance isn't nearly as pointless or as much a \"scam\" as this subreddit leads everyone to believe. ",

Those types of markets are cut throat and many people find that while they can easily sell their home, beating out investors for a slightly large one in the area is extremely difficult. We bought a three bedroom even though there is only two of us. This is not because we are prematurely attempting to solve the issue of having children but because we believe we would be priced out of a similarly sized home in this area in 5-10 years. This area is the best for our degrees. We might not have children but buying a smaller home after we choose not to is far easier than buying a larger one if we did. ",

I thought it was exactly what I wanted out of a house.\n\nWe lived there for ten years but kind of wanted to move on after five, when we realized that we were better suited to living in the city.  We couldn't move though because we didn't have enough equity to sell the house without incurring debt to pay a realtor, and we had no money for a down payment on a new house.  It didn't help that we spent $100 in tolls each month and 30 minutes each way to drive into town to do the things we wanted to do in the evenings and weekends.\n\nWhen we were finally able to move, we chose a two bedroom 1000 sq ft home in the city.  When we had a kid, we added 600 sq ft later.  Where we live now is a much better fit to the person I turned out to be.  Had I been willing to rent longer, saved for a bigger down payment, and not bought a home when I did, I could have bought into this neighborhood five years earlier and $150k cheaper than I eventually did.",

Basically, don't overspend on a home, whether in purchase price or renovations. You want to be able to easily pay down your loan as quickly as possible as to gain as much equity as possible. Negotiate sales commissions up front (hard to do) and ask for a realtor who will only take the same percentage of what your house has appreciated. ",

Conversely, in a traditional you pay the tax when you take the money out and in a Roth you pay no tax when you take the money out.\n\nAt a basic level Roth is more advantageous if you're younger and make less money since you are most likely at an equal or lower tax bracket than you will be than when you retire (Pay tax at 15%, take it out tax free when your other income is taxed at 20%). Traditional is better if you start saving for retirement later in life because you expect to take the money out at a lower bracket than when you put it in (defer tax when you're in a 28% bracket and pay tax when you're in a 20% bracket)",

                            "comment": "They're honestly relatively straightforward. A mortgage is a loan to you. Because it's a lot of money, the bank will require collateral--something that they get if you don't make your payments on time. In the case of a mortgage, the house itself serves as that collateral: a lot of people think that the bank owns the house when you have a mortgage on it, they don't, you do. But if you don't make your mortgage payments, the bank will take the house away from you (foreclosure).\n\nBecause the house itself is the collateral, the bank has a big risk that something bad will happen to the house (e.g. it burns down), so that if you default on your loan they can't recoup their losses by taking ownership of it. To mitigate this, banks require you to get homeowners insurance when you get a mortgage. That way, if something happens to the home, the bank won't lose all the money they loaned you. If the house is located in a floodplain, you'll likely also need to buy flood insurance.\n\nBanks charge a premium for loaning you money--they're not charities. This is in the form of interest, or a proportion of the amount outstanding added to your payment each month. If you make payments ahead of time, your outstanding loan amount goes down, causing the interest to decrease. Long term, making early payments can save tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nEven with a house as collateral, banks don't like foreclosures. As such, they charge more (a higher interest rate) for people who are more likely to default. A lot determines this, one of the biggest factors being your credit score. A high credit score indicates a reliable individual who is unlikely to default, so results in a lower rate.\n\nAnother factor that determines interest rate is the term (the length of the loan). Longer loans represent greater uncertainty from the banks perspective, so the interest rate is going to be higher to compensate for this. Adjustable rate mortgages also reduce the bank's risk, as they can adjust the rate to reflect the current market interest rates. Because of this, adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) will be slightly cheaper, but also riskier for the borrower. You also have the ability to decrease the interest by buying \"points\". This is when a borrower pays the bank money in exchange for a lower interest rate.\n\nBanks want to see that you have a down payment (it correlates with financial stability, reduces their risk exposure in the event of foreclosure, and incentivizes you to make your payments by having a larger equity stake in the house). If you don't have at least a 20% down payment, the bank will make you buy insurance in case you default (PMI--private mortgage insurance). Until you pay off 20% of the house's value, you also have to pay for this insurance. This is why you really want to have at least a 20% down payment--you'll have another cost if you don't.\n\nFinally, the US government wants people to own homes. To encourage this, they let you deduct your mortgage interest on your taxes (you don't pay taxes on an amount of your income equal to the amount you paid in mortgage interest). This deduction is one of the strongest reasons for home ownership being financially beneficial in the US.\n\nI think that hits all the major points. There's some simplification, but it's reasonably accurate.",

Emergency Fund\n2. 401(k) to meet employer match\n3. IRA (Roth/Trad)\n4. Maximize 401(k)\n5. Tax advantaged/efficient investment brokerage account\n\nFor a Vanguard IRA, I would get into a mutual fund (typically $1,000-$3,000 initial investment required) and then your monthly contributions will be no fee trades after that. If you're dealing in ETF's or stocks, pay close attention to the fees per trade. As the old adage goes - \"The only things you can control when it comes to investing are emotions, taxes, and fees.\" \n\nGood luck! \n\nedit: spelling",

The major risk you have when you have while renting is that someone will hurt themselves and sue you, or you accidentally cause damage to other people stuff (you flood your apartment and it leaks into the neighbors). It is very cheap (~10/month) to get a lot of coverage, everyone should have it even if they don't have any of their own stuff to cover. ",

If you try to shift it to your landlord, they'll simply point at the statement in the lease regarding insurance and the judge will agree they notified you.\n\nThe landlords insurance will cover it, but they'll also get it back from your by garnishing your wages for the next decade.",

Co-op's are technically owned by the people who buy their plans, so they will either 1. Spend all profits on better care for members 2. Return your percentage of profits to you. Buy insurance from a co-op! That way your money won't make some insurance company's shareholders rich. \n\nEvery state having a Co-op in their insurance market was the compromise for the single-payer progressives. However, some Republicans talked it down to have states \"opt in\", and surprise only the bluer states opted in. \n\nHere is a partial list of ACA coops: \n\nEverspring Health\n\nKentucky Health Cooperative\n\nEvergreen Health Cooperative\n\nConsumers Mutual Health Insurance of Michigan\n\nHealth Republic Insurance - New York, New Jersey, Oregon\n\nNevada Health CO-OP - Nevada",

Don't be too proud to drive for Uber, or pickup house painting jobs on Craigslist.  \n- Live a little.  Enjoy yourself without overspending.  This is the time to explore the world, go out and get drunk sometimes.  Just don't do it on credit.  Do it with money you earned.  You won't ever be 22 again.  \n- Be realistic about your earning capacity.  If you are a social worker, this is as good as it gets.  Start saving for retirement.  If you are entry level IT/Finance/Consulting, then your income will rise.  Start investing a little, but you could earn multiples of your current income within years.",

I can see multiple comments in this thread alone about saving now and getting on a career path to earn big money so you can go travelling later. Not everyone just wants to make lots of money. I'm passionate about my career but I'll never earn a 6 figure salary so I might as well learn to have (responsible) fun on my budget *now*, instead of waiting for a payday that will never come.",

It's easy when you start making a steady salary to sign-up for small expenses like this because they seem negligible, but if you think about the math this way:\n\nNow lets say you have these three expenses:\n\n+$12 Netflix subscription\n\n+$35 Gym Membership\n\n+$9 Spotify subscription\n\n= $56 a month = $672 a year. That seems like a lot more now, doesn't it?\n\nEnjoy yourself, but just be mindful!\n",

Unless you are really broke its something worth investing in. Don't discourage people from getting gym memberships.\n\nSpotify on the other hand is money that probably shouldn't be spent if you are trying to save, since it has a free option with ads. But unless you are on a tight budget it can be well worth it if you listen to a lot of music.\n\n\nAnyways, yes you're right to watch the small recurring expenses that add up, but I think your examples could be better since at least two of them are well worth it for most people.  Birchbox, Dollar shave club, and cable might be better examples of unnecessary subscriptions to watch out for.",

            "comment": "Thank you - this will help a lot of people.  I hope you won't mind me adding a couple of notes of my own.\n\nOne of the questions I get asked the most is, should I contribute more to my retirement or pay down my debt?  The answer is:  it depends (of course).  The way to figure that out, though, is to look at returns - what will give you the best return on your money?\n\n* The best return you will ever get is a company match on retirement, so if you can at all afford it, contribute enough to your retirement to get the full match.  It's often 1-for-1, which is fantastic, as that's a return of 100%; but even if it's 2-for-1, that's a 50% return, which is amazing.  Take the full match on retirement!\n* The next best return is almost certainly paying down credit card debt.  At 20%+, it's far more than you would make by investing in the stock market - and it's a guaranteed return, unlike the markets.  Likewise 10%+ auto loans and high interest rate private student loans.\n* Past that, very low interest rate loans for *necessities* - say, less than 5% rate on a student loan or a home - are not terribly high priority.  I'd probably still pay them off first, but putting more money toward retirement while some student loans are still outstanding is an OK decision.\n\nA couple of other random points:\n\n* The real cost of graduate school isn't just the student loans, it's how much income you forgo.  A Masters is two to three years, a PhD is five years plus, with little or no income.  Add up how much you *aren't* making in that time, add on top of that the student loans, and ask yourself if it's worth it.\n* I'm not a fan of loans for cars.  If you can't afford it cash, you probably can't afford it on credit.  A car loan (for a very affordable car) is justifiable if you absolutely need a car to get to and from work and you don't have one, otherwise save up your money.  Would you really trade $20k or $30k in cash for a car?  If not, why would you borrow the same amount for the same thing?",

    "postText": "Help me understand the \"FDIC covers you up to $250k\" rule?\n\nI'm talking to Fidelity about opening a 4-CD ladder totaling $100k across all 4 CDs (their rates seems higher than everyone else's at the moment - 5.35% for 3, 6, and 9 month CDs)\n\nThing is, I also have my 401K account and a pension fund at Fidelity, and the sum of all 3 accounts would be in the $1.5 million dollar range.\n\nI thought that FDIC protection only covered me for $250k per *institution*? But the Fidelity rep says, no, FDIC insurance covers $250k per *bank*, and since my CD, 401k, and pension funds are split up across multiple banks (even though they are all accessed through Fidelity), all the money still receives FDIC protection.\n\nPlus, he continued, Fidelity apparently has they own individual insurance over and above FDIC that protects account holders for funds well into the millions.\n\nDoes all that sound correct? Or is the rep feeding me a line?",

Fidelity is just acting as an intermediary.  Your FDIC coverage comes from the specific bank you buy the CD from.",

            "comment": "FDIC only applies to cash and cash equivalent accounts - meaning savings and checkings accounts, money market accounts, and CDs.\n\nYour 401k and pension fund are (hopefully) invested in equities and bonds, not cash. So FDIC doesn't apply to them. Which makes sense - investments, unlike cash, can and do decline in value all the time. If your rep said that FDIC covers them, he's completely mistaken.\n\nInvestment accounts do have something called SIPC insurance. That protects you from fraud or theft and things like that. If your broker says you have 100 shares of XYZ, you aren't going to check your accounts one day and only see 95 shares. But the value of the XYZ can (and very often does) go down.",

    "postText": "I know I still have work to do but I wanted to share my small success story and some gratitude to this sub for helping me get my finances back on track. \n\nIn late 2013 I was out of work for several months due to an illness, and just a few weeks after I returned to work my husband was laid off. I had a small emergency fund but medical bills and keeping the rent paid on time meant that I was left with some sizable amounts of debt, some of which went to collections. I ignored my credit through 2014 and 2015, since I honestly didn't know how to fix it. \n\nThen I found this subreddit. I read every post that seemed at all relevant to my situation, and read all of the amazing information provided here. Towards the end of 2016 I finally decided that I was ready to fix my situation and get back on track. \n\nIn October I signed up for Credit Karma. My credit score was a dismal 590. I thought it was insurmountable, but I took it one step at a time. I treated it like a game -- every Sunday I would log on to CK (as well as several other score providers) to see how many points I \"earned\" that week. \n\nTo start, I found a few old collections accounts that were either inaccurate or were being reported past my state's statute of limitations, and disputed them. To my surprise, the very next week every single one of them had been removed from my report. There is still one small $200 collection account on my report (one that wasn't disputed because I legitimately owe it), which I plan on tackling next. \n\nI now make a good salary but frequently found myself low on funds at the end of the month, due to poor budgeting. I signed up for Mint and monitored all of my spending to see where my money was going. I cut cable, stopped eating out so much, and cut some other unnecessary expenses. Coupled with taking on some extra side work on evenings and weekends when I could, I was able to put over $1,000 a month into savings, when previously I struggled to save even 1/10 of that. \n\nNext, I tackled my credit card debt. I started with about $2,800 in credit card debt, which isn't very much but my utilization was near 90%. Every extra dollar I had went to those two cards until they were paid off. I paid off the lowest balance first, since the interest rates were the same for both cards. Seeing that first $0 balance reported to my credit report was really nice. Once my utilization was under 50% I called CapitalOne and requested a credit line increase, which they provided, taking my utilization down to 31%. I continued paying down my debt aggressively and now have 0% utilization across both cards. It took about 6 weeks to pay these off due to my new aggressive budgeting strategy. \n\nFinally, I called my credit union (car loan) and asked them if they would be willing to remove any of the late payments that were reported during my unemployment, because it can't hurt to ask. To my surprise, they listened to me, saw that my payments had been current since I started working again, and removed 3 late payments from my report as a \"good will\" adjustment. I still have 3 late payments reported, but 3 is better than 6. \n\nToday when I logged in to Credit Karma my score was 663. All of my credit card debt is paid off, my car loan will be paid off in 3-4 months and I was able to replenish my emergency fund *and* start saving towards a down payment for a house. \n\nSeriously cannot thank this sub enough. I've never posted here before but I must have read every single post here over the past 3-4 months, and just wanted you to know that I'm grateful to those of you who take the time to answer questions and help people get their lives back on track. \n\nHappy New Year! \n\n**A small edit since this post got a little more attention than I anticipated! (Wow,  thanks everyone :))** \n\nFirst, I have gotten some PMs and comments assuming that this post was some sort of ad for CK, and I assure you it isn't (lol). Credit Karma was one of several score services I utilized, and I initially signed up since I saw it mentioned so frequently on this sub. I mentioned it by name simply because it was the service I used (&amp; continue to use) most frequently. I've also received some messages from people who, for some reason, don't believe that my post is true, and that was certainly unexpected. If the mods are amenable I would be happy to post screenshots with personal information redacted. The purpose of this post was to remind everyone that a series of seemingly small steps forward can make a bigger difference in a smaller amount of time than you might expect. \n\nI also appreciate the advice to check my \"real\" FICO score. I did that this morning and to my delight it was actually 667, so a couple points higher than my CK score :) \n\nI'm very humbled to hear that my story was inspirational to some of you, and wish everyone great success in the new year!

It was amazing. 10 years later I've managed to stay out of trouble because of it, with a perfect credit history. I think I've paid about $15 in total credit card interest in my entire life. \n\nThe most useful advice my teacher gave us was to ALWAYS CALL the people you're dealing with. They're surprisingly helpful. Any time something fell through the cracks and I missed a payment or anything like that, a quick polite call usually got it all sorted out. CC companies have refunded me interest and late payment fees more often than not. And a call after getting rejected for a card has always resulted in me eventually getting it. ",

Terrible, just as I had figured. I've gotten a few secured credit cards in the past but defaulted on them all. I owe t-mobile something from Dec 2014 and my old college something from June 2012.\n\nBoth make no sense to me as ive been with Verizon for 4+ years and I very distinctly remember my grandmother paying my last semesters tuiton. It could be a parking ticket which would be kind of laughable.\n\nI'm calling both collection companies tomorrow to figure what I owe and going to my bank to look into the possibility another credit card. I will only use it for small purchases that I already have the money to pay for.\n\nI guess this could be my 2017 resolution - to get back into financial shape.

So, I think this leads to a relevant question....with all this confusion how do you know how you stand?\n\nSimple....look at your score drift. CK actually does a great job, and even includes a full report so you can spot for errors, collections, etc.... Exactly what the OP did.  \n\nSource: I work in the industry.",

I guess it's just whoever is evaluating your credit, that's why there are so many different scores for the same person.\n\nHowever, I don't understand how there can be several different FICO scores as well.  Since they are just a single company, how can there be so many different scores?",

The \"FICO x.0\" (like FICO 7.0, 8.0, 9.0) score is pretty general.  FICO 8.0 is most commonly used, but FICO 9.0 came out recently.  9.0 includes changes to the formula, like medical debt in collections will weigh differently than other types of debt in collections.  \n\nBut everyone isn't going to immediately start using 9.0.  Lenders have to pay to get the scores and if FICO 8.0 has been working fine for them, why change to something else?  There are lenders still using older score models for just that reason.  \n\nThen FICO also has score models for more specific purposes, like FICO Bankcard Score X is used more often for credit card decisions and FICO Auto Score X is used more often for auto lending, etc.  And again, each of those will have older versions out there as well.  FICO Bankcard Score 9.0 and FICO Auto Score 9.0 were also released recently.  \n\n[FICO lists the most commonly used scoring models on their website](http://www.myfico.com/credit-education/credit-score-versions/).",

My accounts with Citi and Discover use an actual FICO score, which is almost always ~20-40 points higher than the VantageScore 3.0 that Capital One uses (or the TransUnion New Account Model that they used to use).\n\nScores differ because they use different formulae that weight the various factors, like your available credit, utilization, payment history, account age, recent inquiries, etc., differently. One scoring method might not weight recent inquiries and new accounts all that heavily, while another might lower your score more with those kinds of factors.\n\nIt's a bit opaque because a given formula for a particular score is usually considered a trade secret/proprietary information.",

Maybe you were late on a payment to a company but that company only reported it to TransUnion and not to Experian.  \n\nSo the lender is paying for both the score model and the credit bureau.  The score you're paying for is probably FICO 8.0 (you'd have to check though) and you're getting it through Experian.  Your lender might be using FICO 8.0 through TransUnion, but they could also be using any number of credit models as mentioned in the linked comment.  \n\n&gt; Do they typically use the lowest of the 3 credit boroughs for mortgage loans?  \n\nI don't know what is typical.

Good luck to you.  ",

I told him that if he wanted any future with me (read: marriage) he'd get his shit together, because I wasn't about to jeopardize my near perfect credit (half joking, ha). He enlisted the help of a low-cost attorney for a few more difficult items on his report, but took care of the rest himself. Even discovered that his brother had done some shady shit in his name at some point. His score jumped 100 points the first year, from 550 to 650, and now his score is in the low-mid 700s. It can totally be done, and it's SO important for your financial health. Like anything, it takes some work, patience, and negotiation in some cases, but it's totally doable! I totally commend you (and my lovely fianc\u00e9) for getting it done! Bravo!",

Having your car loan run out might actually hurt your upward credit-mobility. And the difference between a 700 and 750 credit score when buying a house is huge, in terms of interest (and the money you'll ultimately pay for the house, since interest racks up). The advice I've heard, that my friends/parents have personally experienced, is that having a small balance (10-25%) on your CC is a way to improve your score faster. My dad recommends doing that for 2-3 months before you buy a house to juice your score a bit. It's dumb, but apparently, it works. I wouldn't recommend it, however, if it would be morally damaging. That's more important in the long-run.",

And why it is so important?\n\nIs it from 0 to 1000 or what?\n\nAs european, all this sounds so alien to me.\n\nWhy americans use credit cards so much, and so many of them? Living over their limits?\n\nHere where I live, I dont know a single person that uses credit card. Just bank/visa(debit/electron) cards that removes balance from account, cant go under 0.\n\nIt just sounds crazy to get in dept without a reason other than buying shit with credit card.\n\nMaybe it is because of your bad social security? I mean here unemployed gets rent+400-500\u20ac/month and if you had a work, then even 1000-2000\u20ac/month for 500 days before dropping to basic income. And healthcare/education is free/almost free(max some hundred euros a year)\n\nOnly idiots and addicts get in dept by small things, excluding house/car depts of course.",

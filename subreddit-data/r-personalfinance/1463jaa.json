    "postText": "The usual recommendation for making after-tax (non-Roth) 401K contributions is to first max out your regular (Roth+traditional) 401K contribution limit of $22500, before making additional after-tax contributions.\n\nI have searched everywhere but haven't found definitive answer on whether this recommendation is actually a requirement. That is, is it required to first reach the regular $22,500 limit before making additional after-tax contributions? In the extreme, am I allowed to make $0 contribution to traditional and Roth 401K, and then make $1,000 contribution to my after-tax 401K alone?\n\nNote: this is not a question about whether or not the above makes financial sense, it is just a question of whether it is possible/allowed.",

For the tax-free one, I personally prefer a Roth-IRA to a Roth-401K but my income exceeds the Roth-IRA contribution limit, so mega-backdoor is the only route, which requires some after-tax 401K contributions. I could do regular backdoor contributions from traditional IRA to Roth IRA but that has a smaller limit (6500) and comes with more stress (pro-rata rule, bookkeeping, etc)",

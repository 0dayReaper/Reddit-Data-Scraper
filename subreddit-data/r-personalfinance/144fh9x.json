Tell them that you can't afford it, that you'll probably have to declare bankruptcy but ask what's the minimum to clear it with them. Then slap it on a 0% introductory rate card (or put it on an existing card then 0% balance transfer card) and pay to down as fast as you can while on 0%.\n\nFYI, I've actually been able to settle directly with the hospital for less but usually once it's with collections, they often won't speak with you anymore and just say you need to deal with collections.",

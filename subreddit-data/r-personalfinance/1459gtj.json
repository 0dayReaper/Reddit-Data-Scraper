    "postText": "TLDR - just looking for affirmation from those who may have been behind where retirement advisors said that they needed to be (or currently are), advice for how much they ultimately had to adjust their retirement plans, anecdotes as to whether they actually closed (or expect to close) the gap, etc.\n\n\nSo, as I inch towards 40 in a little over three months, I'm reminded of the \"rule of thumb\" saying I should ideally be at about 3x my income in my 401k (which I've always generalized as \"in retirement accounts\").\n\nCurrently I'm nowhere near that - I'm more like 1.3x based on my income and current account balances. I'll be the first to admit I mismanaged saving in my younger years. 3% contribution in the wrong funds working at a job with no matching program, a year in my early 30s where I had to take a pay cut and contributed $0 to any retirement account, a withdrawal from a Roth IRA during a layoff, etc. \n\nI *think* I'm on the right track now - depending how you factor my bonus in and including my current employer match, I'm putting around 21% of my gross pay into some retirement account (401k, HSA, Roth IRA). I've been at that level for the last 2-3 years and keep trying to incrementally bump it up as my pay rises, expenses drop, etc. But I'm obviously still behind.\n\nI think I've mentally come to terms with the fact I won't retire by/before 65. At least not without a surprise windfall or committing myself to some degree of frugality in retirement. But I'm feeling the \"I'm so behind\" more acutely today for some reason. Was hoping to get thoughts, anecdotes, advice etc. from the community. Were/are there others who found themselves behind and have been trying to reverse it? Did you get (or do you expect to get) caught up, and what kind of excess contributions to savings did it take to get there? If you never got as caught up as you'd like (or don't think you will), how has it impacted your retirement plans?",

I save what I can and dont sacrifice my lifestyle to catch up to some made up benchmark.  25 year asset projections are almost meaningless to try to pin a target, and most of the benchmarks want you to have way more assets than you actually need to retire.\n\nI just DCA about 2k a month and let it build. every year I increase the amount a little. maybe Ill do 2500/month next year. but thats what I can afford, no one is telling me to put x in now to reach y target later.",

            "comment": "literally me today! 35 years old, looking at my retirement funds at 1.1x my current salary and wondering how in hell I'm going to save 2x my salary in the next five years??? You have a few reasons you haven't saved as much, but I feel like I've nearly maxed my 401K match and annual limit each year and I'm still nowhere close to 3x. I track my monthly budget strictly, and even with 50% going to retirement/savings/long term investments, I get to 2.5x my salary at 40 at best.  And all the savings now means no room for a big purchase either - no car, no home, no awesome boat to live on. I'm wondering what the hell I'm missing with compounding interest (where are people even getting this), how much return they're making on investments (lol my retirement fund is -8% in the last three years just kill me now), or annual raises (LOL this year sucked total ass). Future promotions are definitely possible but feels too risky to bank on.\n\nAnyways, definitely in the same boat as you feeling like I'm behind and wondering just how much I'll have to pay for it in 30 years....",

    "postText": "Going through a divorce. Spouse agreed to $100K buyout on $230K equity. We refi'd a few years ago at 2.25%. if I refi now with $100K cashout now for thier buyout, it'll be at 6%. Spouse may agree to stay on the loan for another year as they aren't going to purchase a home here, if I take out a $100K HELOC. Hoping the interest rates will come back down next year so I can do a cash out refi to cover the HELOC. Don't know if it'll save me all that much. Spouse and I have agreed that we want the kids to say in this house.  Therefore, we aren't selling the house. Which is the better of the two evils? I don't have enough retirement or other sources to give them in lieu of the equity. Thanks.",

            "comment": "No one knows what interest rates are really going to do in the next year.  Meanwhile, your HELOC rate is going to be really bad, so your blended rate over the next year could be pretty bad anyway, and then you'd have to refinance anyway.  \n  \nUnfortunately, 2.25% is likely a once-in-a-lifetime rate, and there's really no way to get your ex off the mortgage without losing it.",

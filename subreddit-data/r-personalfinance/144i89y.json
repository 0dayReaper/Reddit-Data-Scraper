    "postText": "I recently saw a post about someone asking some questions about their student loans, so I thought I'd ask for some advice as well. I just graduated university and have around $53k in student debt. $15k of that is non-interest federal debt. I have enough money to pay off my $38k student debt that has interest, completely off, but it would leave me with &gt;$5K in my account. Should I pay that off completely and start from scratch? ",

            "comment": "Let me ask a few clarifying questions.\n\nWhat are the interest rates on your student loans? How much cash would you have left over after paying them off? How much do you make and what is your monthly take home? \n\nHigh interest debt, which I\u2019m assuming your private loans are, should be treated like an emergency. You\u2019re paying so much in interest per month that is just flushing down the toilet.\n\nIf you are concerned about your savings dipping consider that the monthly payments you\u2019re making to your loans will now be directed back into your savings. I would pay them off immediately and then put every penny back into reestablishing a 3 month emergency fund and then bankroll after that into retirement savings.\n\nFollow the r/personalfinance flow sheet and you\u2019ll be good",

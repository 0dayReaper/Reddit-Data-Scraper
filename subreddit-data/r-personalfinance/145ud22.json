    "postText": "I got a job that has offices across the country. I get to chose which office I will eventually reside in. \n\nRight now my options are between: Portland, Seattle and Austin surrounding areas. My salary will not change per location, it will be set at $140,000 with $15,000 in relocation assistance.\n\nI am based in the center of California currently.\n\nWhat would be the best place to reside? I understand Austin has a lower cost of living than Seattle but when looking at apartments and homes near the office location it is right in the middle of downtown where apartments are all the same cost as Seattle\n\nThe Portland apartments of the same quality are roughly $500 cheaper per month.\n\nI really prefer the Seattle but if I am saving a decent amount of money I would take Portland. \n\nFor Austin I would need to save a lot of money to even consider moving there. \n\nWhat would be the estimated COL differences between all three locations? Given all expenses are the same. Rent in Austin and Seattle are similar. Rent near Portland is $500 cheaper.",

The commute can be a bitch on office days but you have no income tax on WFH days.\n\nAnd, this may get the reply deleted, but you need to consider things *beyond* COL. You need to consider QOL. When comparing the *states*, not just the cities, \u2026 one of these things is not like the others.",

We live in the Seattle area and had to make a similar decision (although much easier because it was Seattle or SF Bay Area and when comp was the same it was a no brained). \n\nAre you into the outdoors? Seattle is great for hiking, boating, hiking. Yes it rains a lot in winter but it's not a hard rain and typically not all day. It never gets too incredibly cold (compared to a lot of places) but compared to Austin and where you are now of course it will be cold for you.\n\nAustin is a cool city but in the middle of a red state, so if that bothers you, you won't be able to get away. Seattle and Portland are very liberal. Austin won't have the winters but summer will be miserable and too hot to do much outside. \n\nWe have only visited Portland but were not impressed. Very run down and sad.",

Sure there is no income tax, but that average 3% property tax gets you.  Even in the burbs modest houses are going for 500,000, and that doesn't even speak to in the city itself.  That can easily run you over a million bucks.  So just have to factor in what your state income tax might be vs 15K - 30K a year in property tax alone.",

Seattle is a location with nice weather, nice mountains and nature, and close to Canada for Vancouver trips. And you get to stay west coast. Austin gets way too hot and the cost of living there is higher than you would expect. Also it's Texas and unless you're right leaning, don't go there.",

    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI ran up $5,000 on a Citi credit card and have not been paying back the last few months. I am now in a better financial position over the last month and went to go pay the monthly payment (as part of the hardship payment plan I was on) and all back pay (which was about $825) and it now shows that my minimum payment due is the full amount, but it won't let me pay it on the site. It is showing as being charged off this month on my Experian report.\n\nI will be able to pay the $5,000 off in full by mid-July 2023, so I just want to pay this off and get out from under it.\n\nDo the below steps seem in line with what to expect? Am I missing anything.\n\n1. Calling Citi to see if debt has been sent to collections\n2. If it is, I'll wait for collections to reach out with a letter in the mail. If Citi still has it I'll try to work something out with them\n3. I'll send a debt validation request via USPS certified mail for proof of debt that should come with the agreement between Citi and the collections agency\n   1. Using a draft letter like on here: [https://www.crediful.com/debt-validation-letter/](https://www.crediful.com/debt-validation-letter/)\n4. Once I receive all the above info back from collections, I'll call the creditor to see if they will give a settlement offer.\n5. Whatever agreed upon amount is made, I'll ask them to send me the payment agreement.\n6. Once I make sure the payment agreement is accurate, I sign the agreement and send a cashier's check certified mail via USPS with a Return Receipt along with the agreement.\n\nThroughout this process document who I speak to and when, copy all documents that were sent to and from me, and keep a copy of the cashier's check clearance as proof of payment.\n\nThank you for any help in advance.",

If it is forwarded to collections make sure they tell you who owns the debt (they should up front but this isn't always the case). I also would shy away from acknowledging the debt off the bat, make sure you keep and read any documents sent to you as you generally have a window to dispute that you may be able to leverage for time.",

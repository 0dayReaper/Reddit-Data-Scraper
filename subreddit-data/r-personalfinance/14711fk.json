    "postText": "Hi. I have have been dealing with a lot of medical issues for the past year and a half or so. I have insurance through my employer, but I\u2019m still paying way too much in my opinion on medical bills. My husband is on my employer\u2019s plan with me, so we have a family plan. It appears that we BOTH must meet our \u201cindividual\u201d deductible before the \u201cfamily\u201d deductible is met and things start to really be paid by insurance, so I don\u2019t think I am really seeing much benefit because he hasn\u2019t met his individual deductible yet even though I have met mine by about 4 times.\n\n(1). It seems to me that it would be extremely cheaper for us to be on separate insurance plans, especially because we plan to have a baby next year. That will be a lot of medical bills for me and he likely won\u2019t meet his individual deductible again, so I\u2019ll just have to keep paying and paying regardless of meeting my individual deductible. He thinks it\u2019s weird and uncommon for spouses to not share an insurance plan though. Ugh.\n\n(2).  How can I make sure I am not being screwed on all these medical bills? So many come from so many different directions. My EOB from my insurance (Blue Cross Blue Shield) just lists general service like \u201coffice visit,\u201d \u201coutpatient services\u201d, etc. I feel like I could very easily be taken advantage of here and not even know. \n\nAny advice is appreciated.",

However, the family deductible limit is going to be higher than each individual limit.    If that is not happening, you need to fight it.\n\nKeep in mind it resets every year,  so that might be happening to you. I posted this before, but I have hit the out of pocket maximum in May, and it reset on June 1, so I paid the out of pocket maximum again in June.    (that was 12k + 12k, in two months).",

What is your individual deductible and what is the family deductible? Are you sure there is an embedded individual deductible even though you have a family insurance plan?",

Transparency is nil despite legislation that was *supposed* to fix it.\n\nSo you're right to be wary.\n\nThere are websites that help you find the average price for various procedures. Make sure you have the billing codes and then run a Search.\n\nSome hospitals are very willing to put you on a no-interest billing plan. Some better providers will also allow you to negotiate lower bills (although the fact that it already ran through insurance decreases that likelihood).\n\nWe recently dealt with a health network that tried to rob us blind. We put forth a completely fair offer, which they consistently refused. So we went through their financial assistance office (as a last resort), and they got virtually NOTHING from us.\n\nFight back. It's the only way things will change.",

With a family plan there is typically a out of pocket max for individuals and then a family out of pocket max (usually 2x or so the individual max). \n\nOnce an individual's max threshold is reaches during the policy year, more charges from them should be covered. Once the family max is met, everyone should be fully covered.\n\nKeep in mind, there is in network and out of network. That will be billed differently. These all reset with every policy year.",

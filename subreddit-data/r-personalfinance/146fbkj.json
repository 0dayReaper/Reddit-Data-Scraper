It\u2019s hard for me to get super excited about how much I might have in 38 years when it\u2019s so far away. I\u2019m currently 27 year olds been investing 2 years constantly. So even tho I haven\u2019t maxed my 401k I want to start also investing in a Index fund 250$ a months that\u2019s something I can get excited about maybe in 20 years I could take some money out that index fund and put a down payment on Lotus car or small luxury good is this wrong ? To Put 20% in my 401k and know I can never touch it until 59 1/2 years old is tough .. \nthanks",

You should just consider that a part of living: some money goes to taxes, some money goes to prepare for retirement.  Then I would look at your other goals and think about how much and how soon you want each of them, and thus how much money should go to each of them. And understand that if you want the house the most, then maybe you won't invest a lot for the medium term goals (at least not right now). Or if you want to spend a lot of money on your life now, again, there will be less left to pay off your car. \n\nPersonal finance is personal, these are all goals you can have with your money, and it's up to you to decide how you use your money to get where you want to be.",

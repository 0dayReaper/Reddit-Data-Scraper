    "postText": "Does anyone remember MS Money around 2005.\n\nYou could input your bills, input your income, and it would graph your existence into forever.\n\nI loved that feature but they removed it from the product and then of course killed it all together.\n\nHas anyone found that feature elsewhere? It didnt need to tie into online banking, you just input your bills amount and due dates along with expected incomes on their dates, it was awesome.\n\nI loved that i could always see where i would be if i could keep things in perspective.\n\nI dont really have a problem with budgeting anymore, but i still miss that feature.\n\nEDIT: I am absolutely amazed how many people are still using 20 year old software for their finances. I thought id be lucky if people remembered it, let alone so many using it!\n\nThanks for the replies and be safe with your finances! I wish good fortune on everyone. ",

I set up a new system for a relative who had Money on his XP machine and insisted I carry it over to his new 7 machine (well, \"new\" over like 10 years ago).  Not sure what I did but I copied some \"Document\" files over and got it to load up when I reinstalled that same old version of Money.  He since upgraded to Windows 10 and I think it's still working but I know he might ask for an upgrade sometime in the near future.  I'm not sure if those files are kept on a Cloud or stored locally but hopefully I'll figure it out again as it's been so long.",

You also get the \"probability\" of meeting those goals based on assumptions you enter.\n\nAll the majors offer such tools. (Vanguar, Fidelity)",

I gave it a field for confirmation code, and had image upload capability, and checkbox for tax deductible?  then during tax season I could click a button and have it output a nice report with photos in it in PDF form I could give to my tax accountant.  but I got lazy and stopped using it and now I don't even know if I have that code anywhere, or if I even own that domain name anymore haha.  but it was easy to create, so I'd imagine someone surely has made a free tool like this.  if not, this is your chance!  (jokes aside, this makes me curious how well chat GPT would do at designing one)",

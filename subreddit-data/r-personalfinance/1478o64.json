    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI have a traditional IRA from a job I worked at for less than a year over 12 years ago. I forgot about it for years and once I realized I still had it, I started making small contributions to it so at the very least I wasn't just draining the money on maintenance fees, since that was all I could afford and it certainly seemed like a better option than cashing it out. Currently I'm contributing $10 a month and the balance is around $2k.\n\nA year ago I started a new job and now have a 403(b) that I am contributing 8% to with a 4% employer match. I also have a HDHP and an HSA that I contribute $80 a month to.\n\nFor reference I am married, filing separately (for student loan IDR reasons) and make about $48k annually before taxes. I have been sloppy with finances in the past, but am really trying to be more savvy about where my money lands to make it work for me. I've done some research on what I could do with this money but I can't really decide where it would suit me best.\n\nWith all this in mind, what would be the best case for this small amount of money in the traditional IRA?\n\nShould I:\n\n* Keep the traditional IRA open and continue to make small contributions (no change)\n* Roll over to a Roth IRA and make the same amount of contributions (some folks have told me there are more benefits to a Roth IRA)\n* Use the one time penalty free roll over option from the IRA to my HSA, and close the IRA\n* Roll over the IRA to my 403(b)\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

For starters you can just keep saving them receipts and when the time comes the outlays you can document are tax free. They are also not subject to minimum mandatory distribution rules.\n\nIf I were you I would double down on contributing to it. You could also open a separate Roth IRA account.",

For most people Roth is probably going to be worse than traditional in straight taxes, although a change in tax code could change the calculations. But a Roth IRA versus traditional IRA has additional considerations, like your income and what you can deduct, and whether you\u2019ll need to do backdoor Roth conversions in the future.",

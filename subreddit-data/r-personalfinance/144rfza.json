I'll try to list the relevant stats that I have in front of me:\n\n\nCC Debt: $4100\nCC Usage: 92%\n\nIncome: $4600/month\n\nRent: $1000/month ($2,000 split with my fiance)\n\nExpenses: $1,000/month\n\n\nI'm just going to freely admit that I am awful with money and trying to get better. I have a  perfect payment history but have a credit score of 553. My biggest impacts listed on Experian are my:\n\nInquiries: 10 in the last 2 years\n\nCredit Usage: 92%\n\nNew Accounts: 10 in the last 2 years\n\n\nI do have student loans that total around $300k which are about to kick in, so I'm really trying to buckle down and prepare for the shellacking.",

Kill those credit card balances, you are getting charged like 25% more then likely, that shit eats your ability to make any financial progress\u2026 get rid of those high Apr balances like yesterday.\n\nYou want your utilization to be below 35% for a big credit score boost, then under 7% for the best boost.\n\nIf you use a credit card use it for the cashback exclusively and pay it off every month.",

I\u2019m a person with Cerebral Palsy and receive government assistance but I have my own business, budget well, save well, and have a great credit score.  I\u2019m 33 years old currently.\n\nI\u2019m wanting to go from financial dependence to financial independence. I\u2019m a bit nervous because I\u2019ve received assistance for a long time and to go without that \u201csafety net\u201d is a little scary. That said, let\u2019s push on\u2026\n\n1. How do I safely and successfully transition from going from assistance to successfully financially thriving? \n\n2. Are there any recommended classes, books, or other resources that you would recommend? I\u2019ve purchased investing courses on Udemy. \n\nI believe I really can become financially independent, I just need some support. \n\nThank you in advance for your advice, suggestions, and energy. \u263a\ufe0f",

How do they reach their target audience? What ways can you improve on what they are offering? \n\nUdemy probably has several classes on entrepreneurship in general, as well as social media marketing which would probably be very helpful for you. YouTube of course will also have lots of videos about running a business. You also want to look for knowledge specific to the industry your businesses in and the product or service you're selling and  become an expert in it. Find a CPA who specializes in small businesses.\n\nYou got this!",

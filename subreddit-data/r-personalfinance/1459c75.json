    "postText": "I received a paper I Bond from my tax returns back in April and mailed it in on April 11th for conversion. I had read that it took about 30 to 35 days for processing.  And whether calendar days or business days, we are outside that window, so I just called Treasury Direct for assistance. \n\nThey told me that the bond was received a few days after I mailed it \u2014 it would have been nice if they provided any sort of acknowledgment of that online \u2014 and it is currently taking about 20 weeks to process. \n\nI\u2019m posting this for anyone else who is waiting.",

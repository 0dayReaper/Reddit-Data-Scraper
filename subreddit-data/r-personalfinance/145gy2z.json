    "postText": "I'm in a weird situation and want to know if it's me who is wrong or I am missing something with my lender. I'm a first-time home buyer, buying in a tough time, seeking to make the best decisions I can financially while trying to learn.\n\nA quick brief summary; my credit is 670, my fiance is 800, and we make around 200k a year with 75k in savings. We want to purchase our first home in Florida, where I moved to for work, and she's currently still in Minnesota because she has a good stable job.\n\nWith my fiance in Minnesota and me being in Florida, I have to be the primary resident and she has to be qualified as a Non - Occupant Co-Borrower or move within 60 days to be primary. With her job, we don't want to give that up right now so Non-Occupant is the only option.\n\nWe were \"tentatively\" preapproved for an FHA loan stating they couldn't give me a conventional due to my credit score. Later on, we were denied the FHA when sent to underwriting stating that since we aren't married we don't qualify for anything through FHA. I explained we have been living together up to this point, I moved for my job and have had a joint bank account for over 10 years. This doesn't make sense because I read online that domestic partnerships count if outside of blood.\n\nI got back a passive-aggressive email about how he's been a broker for over 25 years and my only option is to put the whole house in my fiance's name as a secondary home/investment but we would have to put 25% down. Domestic partnerships only are for people that live tother.\n\nI did my own research and according to FHA guidelines with Fannie Mae under Chapter 2 of 4155.1 it states co-borrowers can be blood or also \"unrelated individuals who can document evidence of a longstanding substantial family-type relationship not arising out of the loan transaction\". Am I crazy or do we not fall into that category?\n\nI emailed back asking what my minimum credit score would need to be to qualify for conventional instead if we can't do FHA since it's more restrictive. He stated well it's only 640 but without 20% down the mortgage insurance is \"off the charts\" until I hit 740.\n\nNow my issue in this entire ordeal is he stated my only option is to put 25% down as a secondary home purchase in my fiance's name. Now after I started asking questions contrary to my initial denial, he's stating it's only 640 which I'm above but the reason he didn't give that option is because the PMI is crazy since I'm not at 740.\n\nAt a bare minimum, going the conventional route, If I put 20% down there wouldn't be PMI so that's a nonfactor and that is still 5% less than me having to put 25% down as a secondary home, not to mention cheaper interest rates.\n\nAm I missing something? Why don't I qualify for FHA and why are they only giving me the secondary home option? I want to try a new lender but if I'm just wrong, which I could be; I don't want to keep having my credit pulled and dinged as it's not great the way it is but also this doesn't seem right to me.",

You're getting bounced on account of the broker not wanting to get your file kicked back under review if he can't adequately substantiate the relationship between you and spouse, which given the fraud in 2008, is somewhat understandable.",

I\u2019m assuming you guys lived together in MN, but MN doesn\u2019t recognize domestic partnerships. So that\u2019s a no go. It also doesn\u2019t matter in terms of getting an FHA loan. \n\nThe big thing is that this isn\u2019t going to be her primary residence, which it would need to be for both of you to purchase this together with an FHA loan.",

            "comment": "Hi! The 4155 is outdated and is no longer the correct resource for FHA guidelines. The 4000.1 is the most up-to-date version of the handbook. \n\nNon-occupant coborrowers have to be family members or you're limited to 75% LTV. This is on page 180 of the 4000.1, found here:\n\nhttps://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/OCHCO/documents/4000.1hsgh-011823.pdf\n\nFHA's definition of Family Member can be found in the glossary, located here:\n\nhttps://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/OCHCO/documents/4000.1hsgh-glossary-011823.pdf\n\nUnfortunately, there's no \"family-like relationship\" option in that definition and can't really say you're \"domestic partners\" if you aren't living together. \n\nWith that said, second homes only require 10% down on a conventional loan. I'm not sure why they would tell you that would require such a large down payment. If you did your initial credit pull in the last 45 days, it won't hurt your score additionally to have it pulled for another mortgage inquiry if you did want to shop options. Good luck :)",

I called my realtor and she told me that it don't make sense because she just dealt with a client who only did 10%, I called rocket mortgage and explained the situation and they told me my situation wouldn't be a problem. It just seems that everywhere I go, everyone is telling me what I've read online but the lender itself, and thats what makes this confusing.\n\nI asked the lender why I needed to do 25% and he stated it was a recent change that made it 25% on secondary homes. I want to trust they know what they are doing as he put it, hes been doing it for 25 years but I also keep getting very conflicting answers. I wanted to work with these people because they are local to me but I also am getting a weird feeling that something just isn't right.",

It's possible he's being honest and that's the situation, but possible he isn't. Rates are tough right now on non-owner occupied homes; we've had situations where borrowers couldn't put 10% down not because it isn't allowed, but because the pricing is so wack that it would cost too many points to get to a rate that's on our rate sheet (and there are legal limits to points and fees that can be paid). That could maybe be it, but he doesn't want to try to explain it? Not sure. It does sound like you're not getting a lot of transparency in the whole situation, though, which would put me off as well. I would definitely not work with a lender that made me feel that way. \n\nI will say that Rocket is not typically great with pricing but they do a good job of hiding it in their fees, so definitely shop around with more than them.",

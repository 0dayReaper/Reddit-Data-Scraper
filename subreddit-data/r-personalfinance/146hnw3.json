The website instantly declined the transaction saying the card was declined. I paid with a different card, my bank card. Both payments ended up going through. \n\nI had written proof from the vendor stating they couldn't locate the payment from the apple card and only had payment from my bank card. The vendor said they couldn't refund it because they couldn't find it. I sent apple card the screen shots of the account only being funded through my bank card, my bank statement showing the matching charge and date, and the receipt showing my bank card payment.  I lost the case, they stated the vendor said I received the service I paid for.  I contacted Apple again and they said they would reopen the case. I contacted the vendor and they said they would note in my account they do not have payment from the apple card. They also told me to take a screenshot of our chat stating they do not have the payment. So far Apple card has only sent me one email telling me they do not need anything at this time, which is unfortunate because I want to send them that screen shot. I have a feeling I am going to lose because they won't actual do what they are supposed to.",

If you want to win you will probably need to reopen the dispute multiple times. \n\nMy experience with Apple card chargebacks has been mediocre, I only use it for small day to day stuff and nothing that I might ever need to chargeback.

    "postText": "So I'm a pretty international guy. Do a lot of traveling around the world, I take full advantage of the Foreign Earned Income Credit. \n\nAs such, I have a $10.700 Tax return this year. Had 2 accountants look at it. All on the up and up. \n\nWell, instead of a deposit... I guess the IRS /MAILED/ a check to my apartment on file, which was in Glasgow. So that's fun. I do have my best-friend living in that house, so he'll do anything I need which is nice, but not sure how much that helps.  \n\nNow I have an issue where my only bank (Wells Fargo, which I don't use anymore but I keep open just in case) is VERY much a US Bank. They won't let me sign over the check and mail it to anybody to deposit for me because it's too much. I have to be in-branch. There are no branches I can go to outside the US. I did ask. \n\nSo really, I'm looking for ideas. Here are the possibilites I've explored. \n\n1. MobileDeposit with WellsFargo ... NOPE! 5k Limit. \n2. MobileDeposit with Paypal ... NOPE! 5k Limit. \n3. Call up wells fargo and see what my options are.. (Well, they can mail out a mail-in-deposit slip which will take about 45 days to get the monies. Not a great option but we'll see) \n4. Mail the check to the US and have my sister (who is on my account) deposit it. NOPE! Wells Said they need me. \n5. Same thing but with anybody else. NOPE! See #3\n6. Open up a bank account with a better bank. .. KINDA? I applied to open with HSBC and JUST got \"We declined because we couldn't verify your identity\" so I'll be calling their customer service tomorrow. I did confirm with them that they have a 25k limit for mobile deposit. So the plan would be to have best-friend login to my HSBC app and mobile deposit it. \n7. Have the IRS put a stop-payment on it and just deposit into my account NOPE! My tax people ([myexpattaxes.com](https://myexpattaxes.com)) said they couldn't ask for that. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSoo... I'm kinda up a creek here. Anybody have ideas?",

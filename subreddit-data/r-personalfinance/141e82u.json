    "postText": "I'm not even a little interested in getting one, I'm just curious after talking about the Dave Ramsay lawsuit. I've always been on the side of \"only scams\", but my mom does go down for a week with her tennis buddies every year and stays in her friend's timeshare. They've been doing it for nearly two decades, so I guess it's working out.\n\nOn the other side, my in-laws own like a square foot of Florida swamp because they bought into a timeshare that was never actually developed. (See: swamp.) That's more of what I think of when I think of them, or those scammy high-pressure tactics where they lock you in a room and don't let you out until you buy in, and then it turns out you can never get dates during vacation season so you just pay for nothing.\n\nAnd then of course the double-scammed, first they get a terrible timeshare, then good ol' Dave sends them to a company that just takes more money for doing more nothing and they're still in their contract and they've also ruined their credit and emptied their bank accounts.\n\nEdit: Seems like a lot of people are bringing up option 3, \"not a scam, just not good value for the cost unless you fit a particular niche demographic\" which, fair. I'm not in that demo, so I hadn't thought about it.",

I suffer from severe anxiety and having a consistent, and high quality, place to stay on vacation makes a WORLD of difference in my ability to handle vacations without having panic attacks. Compared to paying for a room of that quality on property it has definitely saved us a lot of money as well. It's paid off, just maintenance fee's, and we use it every other year or so which works out perfectly.\n\nSo point is, buy it because it makes vacationing more relaxing for you, not to make money (or even save money necessarily).",

Our math balanced out at year 5 based on the fact that we would be going annually regardless (we run with a team) and the discounts for being a DVC member. The one year we couldn\u2019t go, we rented our points for 2x our dues. So for us, it makes sense. I also like that DVC isn\u2019t open ended. We CAN renew when the building contract is up, but we don\u2019t have to. Should we want to offload them for whatever reason, we could, relatively easily, and break even.\n\nThe flip side is growing up we had rando time shares because my mom was a weirdo. I think we ended up with 4 weeks across 3 different places. One of the places, we went to annually as a summer vacation, but the rest just sat there unused. The dues were insane and none of the kids wanted them when my mom died. I think our stepdad ended up giving them back to the property owner, but still having to pay a certain number of years of dues while giving them up. It was absolutely ridiculous. It was never worth trying to trade in the weeks, either, because they weren\u2019t worth anything outside of their home resorts.\n\nBasically, if you plan to go to the same place all the time and can\u2019t get a house there (or don\u2019t want to), it can be worth it. If not, it\u2019s a wasteland for your income.",

Some purchase 'scratch and dent' time shares at a massive discount on ebay and vacation for only the cost of maintenance fees.  Others are masters of utilizing the various points programs.  \n\nFrom what I've seen on tugBBS (https://tugbbs.com/forums/), these people vacation at the same time every year in the same location for **many** years (think disney every week 30 or something similar) or are semi-retired, early retired, or child free.  \n\nThis is a very tiny subset of the population and most people should stay far away without doing a ton of homework and being *very* realistic about their needs/goals for vacations",

It's a nice perk if you have decided you are definitely going to do a Disney vacation every year, but if you haven't, the potential to get a free/cheap upgraded room isn't really a factor. \n\nI, as a person, am meh on Disney. I have no real problem with them, but I'm not enough of a fan to exclusively vacation at Disney and nowhere else. If I'm thinking about my travel plans for the next 30 vacations I take, \"if you buy a Disney timeshare you could get a free room upgrade\" isn't even part of the conversation. I'm comparing that teensy bit of irrelevant noise to bigger questions like \"what's my bucket list?\", \"Do I want the flexibility to go anywhere or the practicality of having a pre-booked plan in place year after year?\", \"What kinds of vacations will I typically be taking in the future?\", etc.\n\nI get that, if you are a Disney mega-fan and you already know you will be taking 30 years of vacations at Disney properties, the ability to get a few perks out of the deal might be a nice bonus. But it's not a real reason to buy or not buy a timeshare, generally.\n\nA timeshare only makes sense if you already know you are absolutely dead set on vacationing at the same place, in the same context, every year, for the long term. And there's nothing wrong with that! But it applies to very, very few situations. And even in those situations, you sacrifice a lot of potential flexibility for the perception of a couple of \"money saving\" perks.",

The way DVC works is you buy a bunch of points and you can use them every year. You can also save points for a year and borrow points from the following year.  So we have enough points that we can take a week long trip to Disney World every 3 years and the two years in between those we can take 2 or 3 day trip to Disneyland. That is possible because we can drive to Disneyland in about 5 or 6 hours. The other thing with DVC, they partner with another timeshare company (for the life of me I cant think of the name at the moment) but we had a bunch of points left from 2020/21 when everything was shutdown. We used our points to spend a week at a fantastic lodge in New Hampshire for a week last year. One of the benefits of the DVC membership is that if we have ANY problems we call DVC and they take care of us. We've called to get last minute reservations and high end restaurants in WDW or Disneyland.\n\nDVC is like any other timeshare. They are expensive and require yearly  fees (ours are around $1000 a year) and you have to know all that going in. You have to be able to afford it and use it. You have to know that you're in it for the long haul DVC is the only one that I know of where Disney will offer first right of refusal if you want to sell so they keep the prices level. Hilton is not going to offer that you are stuck. \n\nAs a family we are Disney fans, we planned for our kids and our grand kids to use our DVC. We knew what we were getting into by buying into it. We researched it and decided it was worth it to us.  We use it ALL THE TIME. Whenever we can. \n\nYMMV. But anyone considering ANY timeshare should do their research! Getting pressure sales on the Vegas strip (I've been there) is not the way to do business.",

They make their *real* money from you in their parks.\n\nDisney has never tried to make a business out of their huge network of hotels. They make a profit, but they really earn it through your park visits.\n\nOther timeshares don't have that. Or they'll have a resort bar and restaurant. And maybe deals with local attractions or beaches.\n\nBut nothing, absolutely nothing, competes with Disney's profit margins on their parks.\n\nIf you're a dyed-in-the-wool Disney family, DCA can legit be worth it.",

It backs up the previous person\u2019s point that timeshares make sense for people who do the same vacation (or at least, same type of vacation) over and over. Another example, my sister is a beach addict and she has a timeshare in a network of Caribbean beach resorts that she\u2019s been very happy with. But, *all* her vacations are always about flying south and sitting in a beach chair drinking daiquiris, lol. (well, and swimming, gotta give her credit, she really does love being in the ocean). She never wants to do anything else - hates the thought of going to a national park or a foreign city. Me, I loved my one trip to Disneyland and my two beach trips with my sister, but can\u2019t imagine locking myself in to have either of those things be the ONLY, or almost only, vacation I take. My dream vacation list is stuff like New Zealand, South Africa\u2019s national parks, Alaska, the Oregon coast, Amsterdam, Prague, Costa Rica - all over the place, a mix of different activities &amp; interests. I wanna play drums in Brazil\u2019s Carnaval parades one year and the next year be hiking the Arctic tundra, and the year after that be biking around a European city. No timeshare is gonna let me do that (even the flexible ones that have networks of resorts with a point system tend to all be similar types of destinations - like, all beaches). I don\u2019t really like being in resorts anyway because one thing I love about traveling is being really immersed in a new culture and trying to learn the language. Timeshares can work out great for a certain segment of the population, but they\u2019re definitely not for everybody.",

The toughest part is getting up early a couple of months ahead of time to make dining reservations.

There are some people who go to the resorts and don't even go to the parks.

Plus the resorts have options from studios to multiple bedrooms with kitchens/kitchenettes (which seems to be the main reason why people prefer Airbnb over hotels). Obviously not the typical timeshare experience but it can make sense with a not scammy company and right circumstances. I sat through a time share presentation once in my early 20s for the gifts they give you in exchange for your time. Never again, I don\u2019t care what they offer us. Only half of the group were old enough to purchase but nowhere near financially able to do so. Yet they kept trying to tell us how it would work whenever we questioned the affordability.",

There is not any effective friction to keep those costs of growing well above inflation, so once you\u2019ve had it for 20 years, the maintenance fees cost more than paying cash to rent a comparable condo for the same time period. \n\nMy parents ran into this with a timeshare they had for a long time with the largest US time share company. For 4 weeks of time share they were paying over $6000 a year in maintenance, and looking at stepping away from their jobs in retirement they didn\u2019t have that $6000 to commit every single year either, so they eventually paid a lawyer to get them out of their contract surrendering it for nothing in return. Some years they might be willing to spend $5-6000 on a monthly condo rental but as an ongoing liability it would have been a disaster in retirement for them.",

Units don't really appreciate much, but they hold their value if you do want to sell one and maintenance fees are reasonable. If you can't go units rent out for \\~3x the maintenance fee.

Personally I didn\u2019t grow up like that - and my family also appreciated the flexibility to NOT take a vacation to save money, or to downsize the vacay. When my dad had money/career issues for a while when I was in middle school our only family vacations were staying with our grandparents and doing local day trips from their house. But tbh I remember those fondly! We went to a new (to us) zoo, new park and new library, new aquarium, all kinds of takeout food, and slept in a familiar environment. If we\u2019d been locked into a timeshare I\u2019m sure my parents would have struggled more. We were otherwise affluent (my dad was an MD) but he did have issues finding a job he was happy with for a while and I think switched jobs a few times for a stretch. A timeshare is risky to me from that perspective - life throws a lot of surprises at you and it removes your flexibility to scale your vacations down and cut expenses (like the maintenance plan).",

If you move cross-country, you can probably find a Disney property that still works for you, for example. \n\nIf Disney were to go into a brand slump, close resorts, etc. this would basically be like any other timeshare but without the scam contract element of it.",

Yes. But not really a \u201cscam,\u201d with a few exceptions. I would put it in the same category as buying a boat: worth it if you _really_ love boating, but most boat purchasers vastly overestimate how often they\u2019ll want to go boating 5 years after they buy a boat.",

Except that among the population discussed, the overall value of the financial arrangement isn't really a factor. \n\nI think for a lot of affluent resort travelers, they opt to buy into a timeshare more for \"that's how we've always done it\" reasons and not out of some kind of intrinsic value or that the arrangement is a good use of funds.\n\nMost people are rich because they have a lot of money, not because they are frugal.",

It was a higher end resort north of San Diego, where he lives. At first I thought it was weird he had a time share for somewhere close to where he lives, but when he explained it made sense. \n\nFirstly he bought it on the secondary market for next to nothing like a lot of people here are suggesting, he did not buy it directly from the property. So it didn't actually cost him much, he just pays the annual fees. Secondly, he rarely uses it himself. Instead he usually gives it away to friends or family members who want to come visit, or rents it out if nobody wants to use it. He is a very generous person so this is a way for him to treat those he cares about, plus give some incentive for people to come visit him :-) He does not have a big house for hosting people, so it's really nice to put people up in a 2BR condo that's fully furnished with a kitchen and everything where everyone can still have their own space when they want. Lastly, and critically, one of the perks is that the timeshare entitles him to use the resort pool and gym whenever he wants, all year! This is probably worthless for most people who live far away from the resort, but for him the resort is only about 15 minutes away so he actually uses it all the time. He goes there regularly to swim laps, use the gym equipment (which is pretty good, not a shitty cheap hotel gym), and there's a kids water park with fountains and a few small water slides etc which he brings his grandkids to during the summer.",

I guess if you know you want to go to Las Vegas every year, at the same time of year, in the same part of town, same basic setup, and you know you like **that one particular** resort, it could be a good thing to do? \n\nBut otherwise it's not really any different than just going on Expedia or Priceline or whatever, booking the dates you want, and having your pick of options. It's not only unlikely to be cheaper, but it's likely to be more expensive, because you don't have the flexibility to catch a surprise deal or economize if you want to do things a little more affordably this year.",

Similarly, if you want to take a vacation that costs more than the points you have available, you can borrow points from your future balance to fund your trip.\n\nClubPoints, the currency you\u2019ll receive as a Hilton Grand Vacation Club owner, isn't inherently usable at Hilton hotels. As we mentioned above, you can redeem these at different Hilton Grand Vacation Club properties or exchange them for RCI-redeemable points.\n\nHowever, it is also possible to convert your ClubPoints directly into Hilton Honors points. You may want to do this if you\u2019re looking at a location where there isn\u2019t a Hilton Grand Vacation resort, or if you aren\u2019t able to use your ClubPoints before they expire.\n\nIf Vegas isn\u2019t your style, how about a tropical vacation? The Grand Waikikian by Hilton Grand Vacations Club in Honolulu is an all-suite resort located near the beach. Or, if you\u2019re looking for something a little closer to home, you could opt for the Hilton Grand Vacations at Anderson Ocean Club in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.\n\n\nAll of this is to say that there are plenty of options for using ClubPoints. If you\u2019re feeling especially adventurous, you may even decide to redeem points for a trip to the Galapagos, rent an RV for a cross-country tour or embark on a whitewater rafting trip.\n\nhttps://www.nerdwallet.com/article/travel/is-hilton-grand-vacation-club-worth-it",

I seriously looked into the Disney program several years ago.  \n  \n- They are a big and generally popular corporation, with desirable properties.  \n- You aren't completely tied to one property at one resort.  Or at least you don't *have* to be.  \n- If I have the money to vacation every year for 20 years, and I commit ahead of time to do so with you (vs Universal or Six Flags or non-theme park vacations), I should receive a discount vs the cost of a separate private booking each year.  Make sense, right?  Buy in bulk and save.  \n  \nWhile it's hard to really explore the costs and shifting rules of a time share, I did my best, and what I found was that it wasn't any cheaper to use DVC vs buying separately.  Even buying DVC points to use someone else's time share at the same property seemed to be about the same cost, and I have the flexibility to just *not* do that some years.  \n  \nDo your own research on DVC, and see if the math works out now, for you.  If there's *ever* going to be a timeshare that makes sense financially, I think it would have to be Disney's.  So, if you find there's doesn't, you can be assured none do.",

Eventually, timeshares added options to change locations.  Then, they added a point system to make them sound even more enticing.  All the while, a timeshare is based on one thing, a contract.  A legally binding contract.  This is where greedy, slimy companies came into the business.  They could charge any amount they wanted, legally, if they worded the contract well.  Timeshares are now something I do not recommend anyone touch with a 10 foot pole.  Even Dave Ramsey was scammed by one of the companies that were supposed to help get rid of them for you.

Lot of the times (especially if hotel franchises are involved) it's no longer \"same time at this place every year.\" Each year you get a certain amount of points. You're (in theory) free to use them to book wherever they take those points, which is actually more flexible than your traditional timeshares. You, however, need to pay the maintenance fee each year for your account, and also need to pay booking fee for every time you book a place... or at least that was how I was explained from Holiday Inn and Hilton.\n\nI suspect it is worth it in that case if:\n\n* You have a lot of options for vacations if you bought a timeshare for that certain franchise, or at least you like the place enough to come back every year\n* You're buying it young enough to take advantage of it for decades\n* Cost of booking and maintenance cost do not change significantly enough to stop it from being a deal\n\nPersonally, I don't think I can handle the thought of having to take a vacation at the same place year after year. Vacation is a lot more whimsical endeavor for me, which does not really match what the timeshares are trying to sell me.",

They can also generally increase costs as high as they want as often as they want, and you'll be forced to pay or be put into collections. There's no guarantee you'll even get to use the timeshare when you want to use it. In many states the timeshare will also be something your children inherit, fucking them over with the same burden, for life.\n\nThey are always a scam. Never, ever buy one and convince anyone that ever considers one to not buy one.",

They lie for a living and they astroturf.\n\nSome people are talking about buying free timeshares. There's no such thing because you have to pay maintenance fees and can only stop if you sell it. Someone else is selling it for free because they want to escape the fees. You'll regret it.\n\nIf it seems too good to be true, it is!",

For instance I got an offer in the mail for a 5 night, 6 day vacation in Maui for $699 including $75 meal voucher on site and a rental car for the entire time. All I had to do was go to a 90 minute information meeting on timeshares. The deal was killer, I mean just the car rental alone was worth almost $400.  So me and the wife went.  Nice place. When it was time to do the talk I was told this could be mine EVERY YEAR for only $30,000 and $1500 yearly maintenance fee. I pulled out my cellphone and showed him the exact same timeshare for sale on ebay for $399.  Said I wasn't interested, but if I was I would buy the one on ebay for $399.  But thanks for the nice vacation.",

It's the same people every year, so it's like a big vacation family. The prime weeks are priced according to resale market demand, namely ~$20-30k per unit/week. If I want to sell my title, I can do so through a normal quitclaim deed. Not a scam. Annual maintenance fee applies and is not a gotcha.",

My \"timeshare\" is also considered a \"vacation membership\" I'm not locked into a lifetime contract, its 5 years, total package was about 7.5k.  It all comes down to whether you use it or not.  If you enjoy going to the same place and you go there frequently, the package pays for itself.  If you want to go to different places, and do not travel frequently, it will not be worth it to you.  Simply do the math, and understand the fine print.  We go twice a year and save roughly 2k per year on vacation costs using the membership, so after 5 years we save 2.5k. Even if we broke even, it would still be worth it, because we like the place, and get many other benefits being members vs paying full price w/ no member benefits.",

On the other hand $7500 split across 5 years of use doesn't actually sound like good value unless you're going for a lot of nights across that time. Like for 3-4 weeks out of the year x 5 years, that's amazing. But for 1 week a year that's basically... staying in a resort in Playa Del Carmen for a week every year, booked in advance. Which is fine! But not exactly a deal.",

The maintenance fees he pays every year are $750 (and increasing, plus has occasional assessments). The cost to \u2018buy\u2019 the week from the company is $8k. And we would still pay the $750/ month. So in order to break even we would need to go 11 years in a row times to break even, more or less. \n\nWe have gone for 9 years and have no plan in stopping. But we value our options- we didn\u2019t go in 2020 because Covid, we may not go next year due to family events, and we just moved 800 miles south so it\u2019s now a flight + a drive rather than just a drive. We aren\u2019t roped into going for the rest of our lives as our circumstances in life change. \n\nMy partners family owns a bunch of Wyndham points. They use them, and probably get decent value off it. But the couple times we have gone with them they get constantly harassed about buying more, attending seminars and sales pitches. The lady at the check in desk was relentless and was basically holding our keys hostage until we signed up for a session. When we didn\u2019t show- we got calls, emails, texts. Someone knocked on the door and used the ruse- we didn\u2019t know if you were dead! Really bothers me that our vacation starts with and constant has this adversarial element of sales pitches. I just want to relax!",

            "comment": "My wife and I bought a timeshare recently.  Ours is a points based plan with access to 65 different resorts and anytime we want to use them, so lots of flexibility.  The point value of a resort is based on 2 things, the amenities of the resort and the demand.  As DINKs, we have flexibility to travel during off-peak season.  Overall, the value is OK if we use it smartly.  The value to me is it makes vacation planning so much easier.  My wife is very indecisive and frugal, bordering on cheap.  Now I can point to the planning book and a calendar and say \"we have 8,000 points to spend, pick what you want\" lol",

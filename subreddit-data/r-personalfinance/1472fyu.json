    "postText": "This last November I bought my first car. 2023 Toyota Camry. At the time my credit was mid 600\u2019s and my payment has been $618 /mo at 9.99% APR as a first time car buyer. \n\nnow my credit is 755 and I have been on time, even currently ahead on my payments. \n\nI\u2019ve been receiving letters in the mail from private financial institutions offering me better APR and lower monthly payments. I assume it works that they pay Toyota Financial for the price of my car and take on the debt. Then I make the payments directly to the company.  \n\nIs it better to refinance with Toyota directly? Or go with one of these private companies?\n\nWhen I got the car with Toyota I may have fibbed about my source of income and amount of income. Obviously making the payments has been no problem. My main concern with going with one of these private financial companies is they will look into my bank account and source of income more in-depth my then Toyota did.",

You may get better rates than the ones advertised to you.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand that you probably needed a car, but the concern about overreporting your income to secure the loan is probably a sign that a significant portion of your income is going toward your $618 per month car payment.",

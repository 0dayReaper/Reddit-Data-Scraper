    "postText": "I just graduated school and am setting myself for my first place. I live in Chicago, and just started a job that pays $75k. I have 3 apartment choices and am trying to narrow it down. I need to stay in South Loop and be within walking distance of W Roosevelt Rd (recurring weekly appointments in the area). I don't have a car, and have a small amount of debt left from school ($20k). I work form home mostly, but am sometimes required to go into office. I cook most of the time and don't go out often. \n\nAll apartments have similar basics but the amenities and apartment view changes. All prices have utilities added in but not any concessions.\n\nApt #1 - $2171- no moving costs 700sqft\n10 min walk to the nearest train and 20-min to the closest grocery store. This is fine in the warm months but awful in the cold.\n\nApt # 2 - $2354 + moving costs (20 mins away walking) 600 sqft\n3-min walk to train, 2- min walk to grocery store. \n27 floor unit with view of lake + better amenity spaces \n\nApt # 3 $2300 + moving costs 690sqft\n5- mins walk to train 4- min walk to grocery store. 25th floor unit, partially obstructed view and view of south loop below. Top notch amenities including a 360 view of Chicago on rooftop.\n\nI know the common advice is to keep closer to 30% of your income. I plan on moving out of the US in the next couple years and chose the expensive apartment because I'd like to enjoy it while I'm young and have no responsibilities. Any advice?\n\n (Side note: I'm slightly pressured to not make a bad financial decision because I'm fresh out of school and work in finance--it wouldn't look the best.)",

While lower is of course better, if you can make one of these work, you can make any of them work.\n\nIgnore rooftop views.  You\u2019ll go up there once within a week of moving in and won\u2019t ever go again.",

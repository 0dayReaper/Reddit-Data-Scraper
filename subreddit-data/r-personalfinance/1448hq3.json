    "postText": "Married, 42 and 41 years old. Three kids, no college savings. \n\nWe make $180k a year combined. Live in a HCOL area with approx $215k home equity. \n\nNo cash savings. Like zero. \n\n$40k in credit cards due to recent home renovation that went over budget. Also have a $215k HELOC maxed out that we used for the renovation. \n\nOur only retirement savings is $67k in a Fidelity account. Everything\u2019s paused due to our high credit card debt. \n\nWe budget but it feels impossible to set aside extra money every month. We have two kids in orthodontia which is a huge expense plus the kids are so expensive in general. \n\nI am expecting a bonus in September (have gotten one every year) that would be around $7k after taxes. \n\nAre we a total mess?  Average? What advice would you give someone like us?\n\nEDIT: thanks so everyone who responded. It was a much needed reality check. My husband is also following the thread. I am realizing that our budget is sloppy and needs to cleaned up. I am feeling hopeful we can get out of this over the next few years.",

That\u2019s insane. \n\nYou need to look at where your money is going, and find ways to both reduce the outflow and probably increase income. 180k joint in a HCOL area doesn\u2019t go that far.",

Now, you get to trim the heck out of that lifestyle to pay off your debt.   \n\nYes, it'll take years.   In the meantime, you have a nice home to enjoy.  Cut out EVERY bit of 'comfort' and fluff in your spending - and start paying off those debts.   Free time?   That should be fed to a side hustle.  You and the spouse.   \n\nDo not count on bonuses -- that's just vaporware until it shows up in your bank account.  Maybe use that to put into a RothIRA.

Add some amounts (like kid sports, eating out, etc.) as a separate fixed category. No one has a quarter of their take home in misc, especially with no savings.\n\nYou seem to be working backwards - allocating money in categories and spending as much as that category allows, instead of only allocating the money you can afford in that category and keeping it as low as possible. Easy mistake to make, but deadly and not at all sustainable.\n\nI would also start by adding a category with 10% of your take home as savings, making sure it feeds into another, untouchable account directly from payroll. If you can afford 25% for misc, you can afford 10% for savings (especially if you don\u2019t even see it).\n\nAnd for heaven\u2019s sake - stop with the home improvement. If you don\u2019t have the money in your bank, you can\u2019t afford the upgraded home. If ANY of your misc is going to more home improvement, immediately cut it out. You\u2019ve spent more on improvements than most people\u2019s mortgages, and you can\u2019t blame that on how expensive the kids are. (Meant with love, but oh my gosh just stop.)",

One of you saying \"emergency, this debt is sinking us!\" and the other saying \"No, we can't cut that, we deserve the nice shiny thing\" is a recipe for deeper debt, frustration, and resentment.\n\nThe good news is that your income is high enough to kill the credit card debt pretty quickly.  Based on the figures you posted in a comment, I figure you can dredge up $3k/month towards your credit cards (with a fair amount of sacrifices).  Assuming the bonus comes through, you could kill that credit card debt in a year, then pause and reassess.",

Or do you want to model what you should be doing with your budget, treating your earnings with respect, spending responsibly with money after it is earned rather than buying yesterday with tomorrow's hours?   You are teaching your children every day.  What lessons do you want them to learn from you?\n\nThe bright side to all of this is that you posted.  So you recognize some of this consumerism lifestyle is toxic.  And at the very least, you aren't comfortable with this.   So make weekly family business budget and finance meetings - come up with a plan, change it as you need to for progress, find a way to track your total picture.  Maybe even bring the kids into the discussion.  If they want to go to college, they can get jobs.   They can learn from your wins and losses.  They can do better.  And you will, too.",

I wouldn't blame the kids so much as you spent a quarter million dollars of money you didn't have on a renovation -- $8K of orthodonture is a pittance by comparison.\n\nDo you spend 25-30% of your take home on debt service?\n\nYou appear to be below the median net worth for your age, and have about 14% the retirement savings that you would normally expect a couple with your income to have. So, it's a bit of a mess.\n\nThe good thing is that you've recognized that you're in a bad spot and can budget to get yourself on track. You didn't give details for your budget.\n\nYou need to hunker down and pay off debt quickly. First order of business is credit card debt: stop using the cards (take them out of your wallet and off your phone). Spend every dollar you can on this debt. Completely forgo discretionary spending of any kind until it is paid. Pay the minimum on the HELOC each month while you pay off the credit card. You can pay off that debt in 12 months if you pay about $3600 per month to the credit card.\n\nOnce the high interest credit card is paid, you can focus on the HELOC and salvaging your retirement savings. Start by allocating 15% of your gross income to retirement savings. I'm guessing the rate on your HELOC is 8%? In which case, you can pay it down in 10 years if you pay $2600 / month.\n\nIt's not going to be pleasant digging yourself out, but it's possible.\n\nAny money you have left over put towards retirement to try and catch up. I don't think there's much you can do about the kids' college savings at this point.",

Not saying that is impossible but just wanting to make sure I understood that right.\n\nI mean yeah that is a big problem. You didnt mention your APR on the credit card or HELOC but I'm guessing in the 20s for the credit card and probably pretty high on the HELOC too with the rise in interest rates.\n\nYou clearly need a budget.  You say you have one but you didn't paste it in here so haven't seen it.  Do you have cars?  Do you need them?  Do you eat out?  I mean its time to start cutting deep in ways that will probably make you uncomfortable.  The good news here is your joint income even in an HCOL is pretty good so you should be able to dig yourself out if you can just live like you made 120k instead and just pile everything into that debt.  \n\n\nIf your decision to do that renovation when you did is any indication of your spending habits there will be plenty to cut.",

Regardless of if it\u2019s at a typical or low credit card rate, try to pay that off ASAP only letting medical priorities or your kids needs take precedent. College savings are nice, but they should not be your top savings priority. Like on an airplane, \u201cput your mask on first before helping your children\u201d. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot of details needed to answer your question, and I would highly recommend working with a CFP to develop a detailed action plan. Recommendations or opinions require a ton of information. I\u2019m a CPA and CFP and would not feel good providing more advice than what I gave above. Honest professionals can be found through NAPFA.com or at XYPlanningnetwork.com, both sites have search directories. \n\nI have relatives who lots all their savings and incurred debt in their mid-forties and are thriving today (15 years later) after sending kids off to college. It only made sense for them to pay for their third kid\u2019s education, but intentionally never promised it would happen. All the kids understand that life sometimes isn\u2019t fair and they appreciate the honest communication from their parents about what was going on at the time now that the kids are grown. \n\nTLDR there\u2019s a lot of time ahead for you and you will have time to recoup funds after kids are off and grown. Focus on paying down the Cc debt and taking care of your kids health. Work with a fee-only advisor who is a CFP to get you solid actionable advice for your particular situation.",

    "postText": "My wife and I have accumulated around $30k in cc debt. This was a combination of renovating our home, college expenses, car expenses, eating out, pet hospital visits. We don't spend like that anymore and we are trying to tackle this mountain of debt. In the last 2 years, I went from $46k to $75k in salary. My wife makes about $42k. We bought our home in 2019 at $240k and our loan balance is around $210k. Today the home is worth over $300k. What are the best options to tackle this? HELOC or debt consolidation? I have about $15k I can withdraw tax free from retirement but that is a last resort. \n\nVisa - $12k at approx 15 percent\n\nDiscover - $5k at approx 20 percent\n\nBest Buy - $1.5k financed until August 2023 then interest kicks in. \n\nBalance transfer card 0 percent until 2025 - $6k\n\nMastercard - $7k at approx 20 percent\n\nAny advice?\n\nThanks!",

            "comment": "Mathematically, the lowest interest options for refinancing are always the best. If you can get a HELOC at, say, 7%, you could clear out all the CC debt with the home equity you have (I wouldn't clear the balance transfer card though).\n\nPsychologically, the risk is that you just run up the credit cards again while not paying off the HELOC quickly enough. So yes, get a HELOC and pay off the cards, but then budget so that you can pay off the HELOC before too long too.",

Many banks offer option to do a line and then fix all of a portion of that line. I agree, it is likely you can run up the cards again so having in a locked rate and fixed payment scheduled would be best.",

And pay down highest interest to lowest interest and in that order. If you can live like your prior salary for a time being. You can get that down to zero. And then treat your credit card as a debit card. If you can\u2019t pay it off, you can\u2019t afford it.",

Neither do nonprofits but they still need to remain solvent and can't ignore market behavior. \n\nI don't think the increase in graduate school interest rates is due to risk necessarily. It's due to the fact that attending graduate school increases the undergraduate deferment period, increasing the value of the subsidy and decreasing the value of the loan as an asset. So in the interest of responsible program administration they make up for that difference in the form of increased interest rates.",

They have the incentive to be competitive. \n\nThe argument against that is, \"well then why don't they (private orgs) offer a lower rate on student loans than the government!?\"\n\n\nBecause it's a poor investment to give a teenager tens (or hundreds) of thousands of dollars with zero collateral. The realistic interest rate would be far higher. Since the government is the only org providing the loans, and without and scrutiny, colleges can continue to charge whatever they want.",

For undergraduate, for example, the first 2 years, 50% of the cost, is mainly the same general education classes that most degrees have in common. It's the last 2-3 years that get into specialized courses, and even then you will be taking an advanced programming course with an advanced communications course or something. It's not like you get out of college and they assign you the interest rate based on your degree, you are signing up for these loans semester by semester so it would be nearly impossible to discriminate. \n\nAlso, those worthless degrees people like to stereotype aren't nearly as common as you would think. The most common bachelor's degrees given out these days are business and healthcare, that makes up 30% of graduates. Gender studies or ethnic studies accounted for just 0.4% of degrees in 2017. The issue isn't people getting worthless degrees, the issue is a flood of federal money going into our colleges without any kind of price control, so colleges can inflate their prices without consequence.",

    "postText": "Hi. I recently visited my bank to ask about getting started on buying a house since I know next to nothing on how to actually start that process. During that chat, I was encouraged to finance some things between now and when I'm actually ready to get pre-approved/make offers or whatever.\n\nI didn't really understand what counts or doesn't. The bank employee told me something like a car would count but rent doesn't even though it's a reoccurring payment.  I don't need or want a car so he said something like \"people finance all sorts of things\" and mentioned TVs, sound systems, laptops, etc. He also said it would need to be at least $1000 purchase and I have to make sure whoever I finance it through has to report to credit bureaus or something like that.\n\nWhich brings me to the phone. I don't need a new phone but I use it for everything so wouldn't mind upgrading. I'm looking at buying the Pixel Fold and financing it. I can afford it, that's not a problem. But after talking to a few more people I'm not sure anymore. Is it better to just save money? Do I really need to finance 3 big purchases before I can buy a house? Should I get this phone, and how do I know if it will even count in the eyes of the bank? \n\nAny help or explanations would be appreciated. Sorry if any terms are confusing or misused, I barely know what I'm talking about :/",

Your best bet is a credit card you use for everyday living expenses that you pay in full each month. Don't buy anything needlessly since its stilly you'd need to do that to secure a mortgage.",

But it wouldn't be advisable to just take needless loans. Open a another credit card and split your expenses and at the same time decrease your credit usage %. I'd also talk with another bank to get a 2nd opinion.",

An installment loan is different than a revolving credit line. That's why \"finance a thing and make monthly payments\" might be very different than \"have more credit cards\".\n\nAdding a card might help with utilization, though.",

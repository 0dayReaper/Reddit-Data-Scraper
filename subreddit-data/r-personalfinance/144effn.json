Offer one is $93k per annum, 22 paid days annual leave, 50 miles every day round trip, no WFH.\n\nOffer two is $83k per annum, 32 paid days annual leave, 7,5miles round trip to office. Hybrid work policy. 2 days in office 3 days at home.\n\nBoth have same career progression and opportunities as in same or related industry. Limited bonus in each so should not be considered and similar perks.\n\nWhich is more financially lucrative?",

The $10k salary probably outpaces the cost of the added daily commute.  But personally, I'd put a premium to having a fraction of the drive, and only having to make it 2 days a week.  Also, 10 more paid days off are big.",

Which works out to almost 60 working days over the course of a year (480/8=60).  So the commute alone is probably worth about 25% of your salary in time alone.  Not to mention wear and tear on your vehicle.\n\nRoughly 26,000 miles is pretty significant and the cost of that could be 0.2 to 0.8 dollars per mile in physical costs.  So that works out to a minimum of $5200 with a maximum of $10,000+.\n\nThe time alone makes job 2 worth it.  Wear and tear on a vehicle definitely makes it worth it.",

That frees up your weekend time to do other things that don\u2019t tether you to the house. Also, those 3 WFH days mean an extra hour of sleep 3 days a week as you can pretty much just roll out of bed and sign in. You don\u2019t need to get all dressed up &amp; presentable, eat breakfast and drive to work. You can just roll out of bed pour yourself a bowl of cereal and sit down and start working.",

I work on projects all over the place.  Sometimes purely from home. Sometimes 2 hours each way. They have never raised or lowered my rates because I am working on a different project. They typically carry a standard usage rate like 12k miles unless you are telling them that it's parked in storage and not driven at all.  There are many factors that play into insurance costs, and the only time you'd get significant savings as you're implying, is if you tell them you're car is being stored. It's nominal, at best\n\nCar insurance isn't a factor to make this decision on. At all.\n\nSource:\n\nThose driving over 30k miles pay 1 to 3% more on average. At say,  $100 per month, you're paying $12 to $36 more the entire year.  This is less than a tank of gas.

Option 1 is $4,861/year. That's just gas; no oil changes, windshield rock chips, tires, etc. \n\nAnother metric you can consider is the federal IRS rate for commuting; 65.5 cents per mile. 100 miles a day is $17,030 annually at that rate. \n\nPlus 50 miles is like an hour commute. Additionally, you're not getting paid to lose 2 hours a day commuting. 2 hours x 260 working days is 520 hours of commuting. Option 1 is paying $$44.7/hour, so that's about $25,000 of uncompensated time you're shorting yourself. If that 93k offer went up to a minimum of $120k, only then I'd consider it. $125k is probably fair to cover the cost of the wear and tear on a car. \n\nThis process is how I break every single job offer down lol.

For example, while you don't get paid to drive, isn't that time worth something to you? How about the hassle/expense of owning and operating (wear and tear) on a vehicle? The 2023 (per the IRS) mileage reimbursement rate appears to be $0.655/mile. Even if both roles had you commuting every day, that's still a difference of 42.5 miles each way. There are several factors/modifications, but simple math here (5 work days a week, 52 weeks a year, 42.5 miles round trip): That's an extra $7,238 that the IRS would argue you should be paid. \n\nAnd I'm completely ignoring the extra two weeks you get as compensated time off on a year.\n\nEdit: Missed the fact OP had already figured as round trip.

That is at a rate of $.61 per mile which includes gas, insurance, depreciation on the car, and repairs.  Offer 1 you're looking at $480 give or take.  So round off, you will have $7,500 more in expenses by going with offer 1.  Meaning, the true difference between offer 1 and 2 is $2,500.  Which is more financially lucrative? From just that alone, offer 1.   \n\n\nHowever, $2,500 is such a small amount that the benefit of not driving all the time and work from home, and extra days off makes offer 2 the clear choice.  Additionally, Offer 1 may actually be less lucrative depending on things like health insurance premiums, employer retirement contribution, and other benefits not listed in your consideration.  If childcare is a factor now or in the future, those three days work from home can be a significant savings as well if you can reduce childcare costs.  WFH makes like 100x easier.  Me personally, there is no fucking way I'd go for offer 1 just to make an extra $2,500 bucks.",

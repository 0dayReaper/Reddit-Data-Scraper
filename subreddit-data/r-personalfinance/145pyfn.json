    "postText": "Divorced 10 years ago, child/spousal support was financially devastating, and the ex kept the house (I signed a quit-claim and stayed on the mortgage; clearly a terrible decision, but she was unable to refinance). \n\n  \nShe failed to make payments, keeping my credit score pegged in the low 600s (sometimes lower).  She recently paid off the unpaid balance on the mortgage (close to 100k, despite the fact that she has reported making $15k per year for the last 4 years), and I can now finally start rebuilding without that $100k in debt and her missed payments hurting my credit.\n\nThanks to my family helping with a down payment, my current wife and I were able to purchase  a home based on her income only (approx 40k/yr).  Over the past 10 years I've accrued $19k in high-interest credit card debt (average 25%).  We bought well (a fixer upper, on which I've done a ton of work), financed at 2.85%, and have close to six figures in equity.  I have stable employment and recently picked up a side job that will bring in about $1500 extra per month.  I'll also be picking up close to $800/month from the child support relief.\n\nI'd like to take out a HELOC to wipe out the credit card debt.  Assuming the rate would be 8-10%, I'd be saving over 50% on interest.  I'd use all of my side income and the child support 'gains' to attack the debt and get it paid off in under 2 years. My wife is risk averse when it comes to the house, and doesn't love the idea, but is willing to do it because she sees how stressful the debt is to me.\n\n2 questions:\n\n1) Is it a terrible idea?\n\n2) I hate dealing with banks in their branches (find the experience gross).  Is there a decent, trustworthy option to get a HELOC online?  Is 8-10% a reasonable guess on rate?\n\nThanks in advance!",

There are online options as well, but I prefer to bank local when it comes to lines of credit.  Customer service is generally better. \n\nJust make sure what have what got you here taken care of before you refinance your debt into a HELOC.  It\u2019s a tool to save interest - not a tool to spend less.",

            "comment": "Usually that is a terrible idea because most people that accumulate CC debt and take more credit end up with more debt.  Honestly the best solution is to hit the debt with everything you got. With just the child support payment and what you were paying on the debt before you can kill half of it in a single year. It would also work on the saving discipline; once the debt is gone $10k a year towards debt can then turn into $10k a year towards wealth building.\n\nIs it one card or multiple? If multiple you basically hit them one at a time; pay the minimum in the rest and kill the smallest one first, move down the line with the rest.",

            "comment": "Way too much risk. If you can pay this off in two years doing the HELOC, you can probably pay it off in two years plus one month. \n\nThe risk is if you are unable to pay the debt, nothing happens to you. Your credit will be screwed but you're not going to buy anything with no money. If they sue you, you have no money. However, if you are unable to pay the HELOC, you may lose your home. All this risk for a couple months more of payments. I don't think the reward is worth the risk.",

If you and your wife are committed to sharing your finances then it might be worth looking at getting a joint credit card with a low or zero interest rate offer. You will probably have to pay a transfer fee but it\u2019s usually around 3% and you get the benefit of paying this debt off in 12 to 18 months. As long as you don\u2019t rack up any more debt, you can pay off 19000 dollars in less then 9 months if you\u2019re putting 2,300 dollars in every month. If that isn\u2019t feasible then the best financial move is getting a HELOC. Stow away your credit cards unless you have the means and the mindset of paying off your credit card every month.",

Or is it pretty much the same thing?  \n\n\nAlso, does this mean I can make my own person 401k now somehow?",

It's cheaper for an employer to offer a SIMPLE than a 401k and thats likely way they switched.\n\nYou should have significantly more investment options \n\nHere is a rundown of different rules that apply to SIMPLE's\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/simple-ira-withdrawal-and-transfer-rules",

It\u2019s a pretty common thing for your typical scam advisors (Raymond James, Edward Jones, etc) to push business owners to let them admin a Simple IRA. They will pretty much eliminate all the employer-paid admin fees, instead each employee will be paying a unreasonably high admin fee. Raymond James does not even have a client-facing investment portal, and has no auto-investment features. So you have to bug your advisor to make investments for you each payday. \n\nYour employer can also go with someone like Fidelity or Schwab who can admin the plan with no fees. At least that\u2019s what I recall that both those brokerages will admin with no fees, and you get access to their excellent fund options.",

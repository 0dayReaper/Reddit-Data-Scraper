    "postText": "Hey everyone so my wife and I are looking at houses and have really seriously been considering some homes we have looked at. We found a new construction that we really loved and want to know if it is affordable.\n\nI (26m) currently make $72k with a 5% bonus based on company/individual performance. My wife (24f) starts as a school counselor (just graduated in May) in August making $55k with another $4k bonus for coaching for a total of $59k. She also coaches volleyball on the side and does private lessons and camps which earns around another $5-6k on the conservative side. I am assuming Total Household income come mid august will be around $135k to be on the safer side. My wife\u2019s health insurance is at no cost to us (employer paid) so that will save a lot when looking at take home pay. I\u2019ve read countless times about the 28% rule of thumb for what we can afford. Using this rule we could afford a mortgage inclusive of taxes, insurance etc of $3,150/month. \n\nThe house we were looking at was about $420k and would be pretty close to the $3,150 mortgage. This seems like a lot given our age and first home and really first big purchase. My wife wants to get something that we can start a family together and won\u2019t outgrow after a few kids. With house prices like they are this seems hard to obtain without spending into the $400k figure for a house. We live in the Minneapolis area where homes around the twin cities and suburbs are not cheap. We are looking farther away from the cities to be able to get more house for our money. \n\nWe have enough in savings to put 5% down so around $21k and would be able to cover closing costs out of pocket as well assuming a 3% closing cost. After this we would have around 3 months expenses in our accounts for our emergency fund. \n\nFrom my math we would be paying around $3100 for the mortgage and would be left with around $4000-4500 in any given month for all other expenses. We have only $250 a month in other debts for my wife\u2019s student loans that will start up again eventually. \n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated! It\u2019s our first big purchase and being first time homebuyers makes us both a little nervous but also excited to start a family. Thanks!\n\nEdit: Additional Info - Our rent for a small one bedroom apartment in the suburbs will be increasing to $1600/month. This has really got us to start thinking about purchasing a house.",

You can see all over TikTok many inspectors going around new constructions which have so many issues.  \n  \nA rule of thumb is just a helpful guide if your other expenses aren\u2019t large (or can be cut back), you can have a well funded emergency fund / savings (which will have to be increase as homes need maintenance/repairs), and you can contribute a good amount towards retirement, then you\u2019re golden. I don\u2019t see car debt in your post, if none then that\u2019s a higher % you can afford for housing.  \n  \nDue note that just 5% down I believe means that the MIP charge on a FHA loan never goes away (unless refinanced).",

It's kind of insane and you can easily spend thousands in the first year just for basic stuff. I'd say your over shooting by about 100K. If you want a 400k+ house, you need more then 5% down (try 20%) and a good sized emergency fund for issues that are going to happen. \n\nIt's okay to start humble and work your way up responsibly, instead your setting yourself up for failure by stretching your way into a home most people take 10- 20 years to comfortable afford. You want to have healthy cushion for vacations, children/child care and life problems that always come up.",

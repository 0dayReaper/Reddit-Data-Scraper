    "postText": "Cross posted on financial planning- \n\nI (36NB) am in need of some financial guidance and support as I navigate through a series of significant life changes. As an adult, I find myself feeling lost and unsure about how to handle everything that's been happening. In the past three months alone, my life has been moving at lightning speed, and I could really use some advice.\n\nHere's a brief summary of my situation: I have been living in a manufactured home with my two teenagers (12&amp;16) and partner (37NB). Unfortunately, the park where our home was located is undergoing gentrification, forcing us to move. We managed to find temporary accommodation in an Airbnb, which we have been staying in for the past 90 days as my Grandpa was going to let us live in one of his homes but unfortunately he passed away before changing the trust, making it irrevocable. This just added to the stress. However, this week, we will be signing papers to purchase the home as we're buying is from my family's trust since that was stipulated in the document. The cost of the home is $10,000, which will be deducted from my payment in the trust. As a result, my annual expenses for owning the home will include $1,350 in taxes and approximately $1,500 to $2,000 for homeowners insurance. \n\nAs you can imagine my cortisol levels navigating the last three months has been WILD. \n\nCurrently, I earn $52,000 per year, but I have zero savings due to the impact of Covid-19. My partner is in the process of applying for VADisability, which is expected to provide an additional $30,000 per year once approved but also brings in 45k from their job. On top of that, I have accumulated $10,000 in debt from personal loans and credit cards during the pandemic, as well as $26,000 in auto loans for our two cars. \n\nAdditionally, I will soon have around $230,000 in pure equity, which is quite unexpected and overwhelming.\n\nRecently, someone suggested a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) as a good option to pay off all my debts and make necessary improvements to the house. I discovered that my credit union offers HELOCs, and I plan to visit them in the coming weeks to discuss it further.\n\nWhile I recognize how fortunate I am to be in this situation, I can't help but feel overwhelmed. Within just three months, I've lost my previous home, believed I would be moving into this new home as planned with my grandfather, but his passing complicated matters due to the irrevocable nature of the trust. Now, instead of merely living in the house, I will be its owner.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any guidance or advice you can offer me because as previously stated I have no clue what I\u2019m doing, \n\nThank you all in advance for your support.",

If you will have no mortgage/rent payment and earning 56k+ what your partner brings, I would make a tight budget and see if you can make good progress on these debts. Let things settle down a bit before you decide whether to take out a loan. Good luck!",

                            "comment": "That's great wrt income: 97k combined household salaries + 30k from your partner's VADisability = 127k annual income. That's great with no mortgage, and it should be quick to get rid of these debts if you make a budget and stay focused. Debt repayment is manageable with that income. Just list the debts in either avalanche or snowflake order and get going on paying them off one by one. It's actually satisfying to pay off debt once you get into it. I personally am against taking out unnecessary loans just because you can; it's a risk of getting deeper into debt/overspending, which is always a risk when you are overwhelmed. I'd talk to your partner asap to get on the same page about your plan for debt repayment, etc.\n\nThis sub has great guides for debt repayment and budgeting. Lots of great info here. Good luck!",

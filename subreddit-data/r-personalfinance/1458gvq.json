    "postText": "I have the opportunity to purchase a house severely under market value. I would most likely rent this house out. I would need to take mortgage on the house, and would need to spend most of my cash on the down payment and to make it livable again. \n\nOption 2) I have a couple that would love to purchase the house as an investment property. They have offered me a huge lump sum of cash (100ish k) to for the rights to purchase this property for the price I could get it. (long story on why I'm able to get it at this price)\n\nDo I invest long term but burn up 70% of my liquidity/cash savings (not 401k) or do I take the cash now? \n\nI could rent the house and get about $500-$800 on top of my mortgage. \n\nAppreciate any and all help.",

Think about what if it takes 6 months to get the work done to make it livable? That can EASILY happen. Permit delays etc. can take months. For that time you are paying the mortgage, paying for repairs, paying taxes and income is zero.\n\nOnly advice is to negotiate on option 2. If they offered 100k cash, that means 150 is on the table.",

    "postText": "My credit score is currently 731, which is good. But my wife and I are looking to get a new house in a couple years. She is the only one on the current mortgage (my credit score used to be absolute shit and we bought it before we were married) and we both want us to be on the next one so I would like to get my credit score up into the 800s if possible.\n\nCurrent income is approximately $42K a year if tips are good. I owe $4300 on a student loan and $1300 on a store credit account. I have a credit limit of about $25K on three cards. Car is currently paid off and working fine.\n\nAny tips?",

If you have more than 10% utilization or too many accounts reporting balance it'll drop your scores.\n\nYou can pay early to get lower balance reported. Most banks only report your statement balance once a month. Of course this only boost credit scores short term, what you want to do is ask each of your accounts for a limit increase once or twice a year.\n\nAlso is there anything negative left over on your credit reports, such as late payments or collection account (even if paid in full)?",

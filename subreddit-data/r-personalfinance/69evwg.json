    "postText": "My wife and I were looking at getting a bearded dragon for our son for his birthday. A young beardie is only about $60. So we set aside $200 in our budget counting on buying a reptile aquarium and some incidentals. \n\nThen we learned it needs expensive UV bulbs that last about 6 months and are about $40 each. Also the electricity cost the run this heat 24 hours can be a drain on the electric bill. \n\nAlso the beardie needs to go to the vet every 6 months for a checkup. And finally, food. They have a very diverse diet and can eat up to $15 per week in foods. So I did a total cost analysis for a beardie that lives 12 years and it turned out to be a whopping $10,000 \n\nLife pro tip, do a total cost analysis on pets before deciding to purchase. Even free pets are absurdly expensive. In 12 years both of my kids are going to be in college and I will desperately need $10,000 then. I will not need an aging lizard.\n\nEdit: For everyone giving me shit about my poor son, don't pity him. First he didn't know about the beardie. Second we are taking that $200 and taking him to an amusement park. He's fine. \n\nEdit 2: This post is not about \"don't buy pets, they're expensive.\" The post is about \"make sure you're aware of the full cost of something before making a decision.\" Yes we have kids and dogs. Yes they're more expensive than lizards, but for us well worth the cost. A reptile, not so much. \n\nEdit 3: Thank you all for the \"you're way overestimating\" and the \"you're way underestimating\" posts. The accuracy of the cost really isn't the issue. The issue is we were expecting something minimal and almost made a big mistake. The point is, we did the research and it was way more than we were expecting and wanting to pay. To us, it wasn't worth it. We have other pets. We aren't frugal, but we are smart with our money. I am simply encouraging others to do cost analysis. And at the end of the day if a bearded dragon is worth 10k to you, awesome! Do it. ",

She melts my heart.  \n\nRodents, on the other hand, seem to hate attention and are naturally nocturnal. Unless they're rats but even then they're constantly pissing and pooping.\n\nI hate crickets with a burning passion, she only gets super worms (which I'm in the process of breeding). ",

They're hardy, so they'll live longer than a lot of other fish if kept in a bowl, but the ammonia destroys their gills and slime coat.  Same with bettas.  \n\nYou can also teach goldfish to do tricks so they can definitely be more fun than a lot of other small pets.  \n\nThe cheapest way to keep fish is to get a plain tank, a decent filter, and then research everything carefully.  A lot of fish die because of things fish owners do that *seem* like they make sense, like changing the filter media.",

I have multiple bearded dragons, and take care of tons of them at work. Every dragon is different  and they all have their own awesome personalities. I have some that perk up the minute I walk in the room, who scratch at the glass to be let out and who love to cuddle and snuggle while I watch tv. One even goes on hunger strikes if not cuddled often enough. They recognize people and react differently to them, and I've seen them show some interesting problem solving abilities too.\n\nWhile some are cuddly, others are less social, and while dragons dont have the same level of bonding/loyalty and neediness that a dog has, they're not just barely more than a living ornament. The big personalities they have in such small bodies are one of the reasons they're my favorite pet. ",

For instance, it is totally valid to forego treatment for cancer when your pet is diagnosed. Treat for pain management and just let your pet enjoy the end of his/her days. It's also valid to give it a shot and treat for cancer to try to beat it. This is the outrageously more expensive approach, but some people go for it.",

The other needs to be swaddled in a towel and given a dozen treats during the course of it. Some kitties dont need their nails trimmed but mine are indoor and i swear the scratching posts just sharpen those bad boys. On another note if you cant trim your cats nails but it needs to be done bring them to a groomer and request it. Anyone that believes in declawing is a monster and shouldnt get a cat if they arent prepared to deal with kitty needs.\n\nEdit: I'm getting too many responces and I just dont feel like arguing over weither your furniture or cats happiness is more important. Declawing is ok in very rare circumstances if it's effecting your cats health or its litterally a choice between declawing or having to give up your loved pet because of lease conditions. If its to save your furniture, dont own a cat. IMO that reasoning is shallow and pisses me off.\n\nAt the end of the day I encourage anybody considering declawing to educate yourself independantly and think about the needs of your pet that can't communicate those needs to you. Personally I wouldnt cut my fingers off, so I wouldnt do it to my cat. /rant",

A week later, 2000 crickets are dead and/or stink like hell.\n\nThere is good news.  Look into Dubia Roaches.  $100 or so to start a colony and we never had to by the bastard proteins again.  They're easy to care for, breed like mad, live forever (2 years!) and are healthier anyways. ",

Price for the Beardie is right and starting up costs are correct. \n\nI have had to buy two uva/uvb bulbs at 10 dollars each in the past year and a half.\n\nI buy his basking bulbs at the dollar store, because they are the same exact bulbs at the pet store for a difference of 12 dollars. Those last me for four months, so 3 dollars a year.\n\nHis night basking light is 10 dollars and I've bought those twice in the last year and a half.\n\nSo in 18 months, I've spent a total of 43 dollars, which comes out to 2.38 a month for lighting.\n\nMy electricity bill has not increased due to his lights, I'm not sure why you would think bulbs like that would cause significant increases. \n\nYes you can take your Beardie to a vet, but I've never taken him to the vet and he is healthy and fine. That being said I have never seen someone do six month check ups on a Beardie.\n\nAs an adult Beardie, I spend 16 dollars a month on his food. I get his super worms at a discount at a locally owned pet store and I buy bulk turnip greens, which is kept right last a hell of a long time. I spend 10 dollars on his worms and a 1.50 a week on his greens. If I buy different veggies for me, he will get them. However, others have mentioned breeding your insects especially Dubias (which I'm going to do to cut down on the already low cost). I hope you didn't count what a young Beardie costs in food for your analysis throughout those ten years. Adults eat more veggies than proteins, which is a lower cost. \n\nCalcium for dusting is like seven bucks, I've bought one jar that has lasted me the entire time he's been with me. \n\nAs a young Beardie, he will need more food which is a higher cost, but if that bothers you perhaps look into adopting an adult Beardie, which is lower cost and easier to maintain. \n\nbulk options when I did this, you can buy online through a variety of sites and even Amazon. DO NOT BUY BULK CRICKETS. Honestly just avoid crickets, they're disgusting and die like crazy. \n\nFinally, a pet is going to cost you money and the happiness and the responsibility that a child will learn from a pet outweighs monetary factors I believe. You may believe differently. Now I'm not saying if you are not financially able to, to get one, but man Beardies are fantastic pets. \n\nEdit: grammar ",

Not only does it get you a great pet but you get an established animal past some if the trickier stages of care and if you only have it for 6 years instead if 12 your costs are essentially halved (assuming bearded dragons don't tend to develop expensive end of life conditions). Heck  if you adopt directly from the previous owner you can often get the entire set up for a fraction of the price.  When I was looking for a new rabbit hutch the best priced hutches usually said rabbit included.  I paid a little extra for one that came without a new friend.  ",

But the rest of those costs seem very high. \n\nA roach colony also will help reduce feeding costs significantly and it is far easier to setup and maintain then you might think, but it would probably over produce if you are just feeding one animal.  \n\nI would bet we were well under $200 year for the beardies (we already had the cages, and we had the roach colony for feeders.)  Our other expenses were superworms or waxworms for occasional treats, vitamin supplement dust for the feeder roaches, electricity, and the heat lamp which lasted 2-4 times as long as the UV bulb.  ",

The idea that they need to go to the vet every six months is absurd. The only thing I regularly spend money on is vitamin and calcium powder.

            "comment": "My sister has a bearded dragon. I maintain two leopard geckos myself. I know for a fact that the Light bulbs are not $40 a piece. I buy bulbs from my local pet store that cost around $10-12 a piece when you buy a multi-pack. Also, I have never heard of a lizard going to a vet every six months for a checkup. My Geckos are about 9 years old and my sisters Bearded Dragon is about 7 years old, neither have ever seen a vet. Food can get costly, however the nice part about the variety that a bearded dragon will eat means you don't always need to buy the items on the expensive end of the spectrum. Crickets are about ten cents a piece and the bearded dragon usually goes through 100 every two weeks, on top of that it eats mostly Kale, Greens, Squash, Zucchini, or Bell Peppers. In the colder months it seems to crave more vegetables and less crickets, lowering the cost of feeding that much more. I am not saying that the bearded dragon experience is for everyone, but it is definitely not as bad as you are making it sound. The best advice I could give is to go for the 50 Gal tank right away. My sister went through multiple sizes as the lizard was growing, which seemed like a waste of money. ",

It's not like it is outside all day interacting with a ton of different other animals or diseases. And if it lasts a good 10 years by itself, is it really worth going in every 6 months?\n\nShe no longer has the dragon and I think gave it to someone else. lt sounds like they are very resilient creatures.",

            "comment": "&gt;They have a very diverse diet and can eat up to $15 per week in foods\n\nAs a bearded dragon owner, I'd like to know where you're coming up with this figure. For example, my wife and I feed ours a diet of turnip greens, squash, and papaya with crickets and mealworms being offered occasionally and we don't spend anywhere near $60/mo feeding ours:\n\nWe generally keep squash on hand for our own consumption. No added cost there.\n\nTurnip greens run $0.98 / bunch here at nearly every grocery store. Rinsed and properly stored, a bunch will last 3 weeks. Even figuring a band new bunch every week for lizard food, it's still less than $5/ month added cost.\n\nLikewise, a whole papaya can last upwards of a month if properly prepared, and in our area costs around $3/ each. \n\nLive crickets run around $0.14/each out here as well. A bag of 10 lasts us about a week, but varies on how often we offer them to our beardie. Even figuring 5 crickets daily puts the cost at around $20/month. \n\nTotal added food cost for beardie ownership ends up being $20+$3+$5, or $28 per month, less than half of the $60/month ($9,360 of the $10k+ over 12 yrs) you had figured. Point is, there's a lot of overlap between beardie and human food in terms of what both species can safely consume, and utilizing that overlap is common sense. Simply changing to over to a different smartphone carrier can save this much, as can skipping McDonald's (or any other fast food) for the family one night a month, or brown-bagging your lunch twice a week.\n\n&gt;The accuracy of the cost really isn't the issue. The issue is we were expecting something minimal and almost made a big mistake.\n\nSo far, you're overestimating food cost of the animal by 50%. I realize prices fluctuate based on location and sloppy math is great for keeping finances in check, but please be realistic. FWIW, electricity costs of the animal, when figuring $0.11/kWh with 2x 40w bulbs, only equal to an additional $6.34/mo. Cutting a morning trip to Starbuck's once a month can cover that easily, as would ordering off the dollar menu instead of getting a regular menu combo, or skipping the soda machine every other day.\n\nPoint is, after doing the cost analysis, did you see where you could use your money more efficiently to obtain this pet (without much, if any, impact on your quality of life) or did you simply leave it at that?\n\nI agree with you in that you should **always** do a long-term cost analysis to determine if the payoff is worth the price. I do not, however, agree with you in the apparent importance of accuracy in these estimates.",

            "comment": "Good for you - too many people buy Beardies without the knowledge or intent to take care of them properly. Just want to point a few things out for other people reading- \n\n- Their UV bulbs should *not* be on 24 hours. That is very bad for them - they need night time just like anyone else. If your house gets too cold, you should look into an alternative heating solution that doesn't require light, or just don't get one at all.\n\n- The easiest way to save costs is to breed Dubia roaches at home. Most people, understandably, are not willing to do this! So what they do instead is feed them over-priced crickets from a pet store. This is terrible. For one, crickets are not nutritious, they are mostly made of chitin and very little substance. They also die quickly, which smells terrible and can cause health problems for your lizard if you're feeding it out of a collapsed colony. They also cannot be contained, so they'll hop all over the cage which can make a mess, and they will bite your lizard at night. Dubia Roaches are easy to maintain, they don't smell, they are sanitary, they can't re-produce if they get lose in your house, they don't die easily, and they are very nutritious. If you are not breeding your own roaches - $15/week is not realistic. Think $5/day if you're buying roaches. \n\n- Lastly, there are additional costs that aren't quite as significant but can still add up. You need to coat their food in 2 different kinds of vitamins, for example. And on top of the UV bulbs, you need heat bulbs 12 hours a day which cost $15-$25 and need to be replaced every 4 months. ",

So instead of posting those requirements and getting called out on their severely inadequate policies, some companies give more reasonable restrictions and then silently truncate and sanitize your passwords after you've entered them.\n\nYou might think your password is Sup3rsTr0gP@$$worD!, but entering supr3rst will work just fine too. \n\n",

When creating your account you might type Sup3rsTr0gP@$$worD!, and the password textbox would stop after 10 characters, at Sup3rsTr0g.  It was a small textbox, though, so hard to tell no more \u2022 's were getting entered.  When logging in the password textbox had no character limit, so if you typed Sup3rsTr0gP@$$worD! that's what was sent.  Sup3rsTr0gP@$$worD! is not Sup3rsTr0g, so invalid password.  \n\nI've seen other sites (including a financial institution) only let you enter valid characters when creating the password, but lets you enter anything when trying to log in.  This specific site doesn't allow periods for some reason, so if you change your password to Sup3rsTr0.gP@$$worD! you probably wont notice no \u2022 was added when you entered the period.  There was no notice saying an invalid character was added, it was just skipped and saved as Sup3rsTr0gP@$$worD!.  Try to log in with Sup3rsTr0.gP@$$worD! and it fails.  \n\nBrilliant!",

It asked me for to create a password whilst I was working on setting up Outlook for business, and I used KeePass like I normally do, not making it anything special because I was probably going to change it later.\n\nEverything set up, I go to log in, and it doesn't let me.\n\nGetting super frustrated I go through everything I can think of to get this working. Then I notice *on a different part of their site* it mentions that the password is limited to 16 characters. So I try the first 16 characters of my KeePass password only... and it works.\n\nWell I thought, when I pasted in the KeePass password, it only accepted the first 16 characters, maybe I just didn't notice. Nope, it let you put in 20 characters +, then just truncated it down to 16\n\nHere is an article about the 16 character limit\n\nhttps://community.spiceworks.com/topic/581383-office-365-password-length-really-limited-to-16-characters",

A new password implementation of 16 characters? No. They break the 16 characters into two sets of 8 and authenticate each set separately as two distinct passwords.\n\nAt first blush it seems fine but it's not. It turns out that each password take slightly longer to authenticate if it's incorrect than if it is correct or something like that, so if the auth attempt fails slightly faster than usual then you know you either have the first or last 8 correct. \n\nThis makes brute force and variations like rainbows like a square root faster (don't quote me on the math, it's a lot fucking faster)",

When you've been with a company for 20 years you can start throwing the word \"loyalty\" around and it seems to scare the shit out of WF bankers. At this point, any issue we run into with them can be solved with \"I don't understand, other banks do this and we have been with you guys for over 20 years.\" \n\nIt's a horrible song and dance to go thru, but it gets results and I don't know enough about other banks to know if switching is worth it.

Because password strength is mostly a factor of length, and to lesser extent character class complexity.\n\n* The 6 character minimum is considered extremely insecure,  and has been for many years now. Susceptible to brute force attacks.\n\n* The parts about repeating characters, or sequential characters is considered harmful. Because policy on permutations or repetitions only makes sense when passwords are very short in length. However, it's been successfully argued (and now established) that character sequences is good password security. That is because a malicious observer watching somebody type their password might not see the quick double stroke of a single key. In other words it helps thwart shoulder surfing password thieves. With sufficiently long passwords there is no reason to disallow any permutation or repetition, which goes back to the reason these kind of rules are considered harmful.\n\n* The parts about \"may contain special chars\" is actually fine, but only for sufficiently long passwords. For example, if your password is 20 characters long, and a verse from your favorite song (a phrase).... it might as well be all lower case characters because at that point adding character complexity only nominally improves overall security. However it's again worth pointing out that a 6 character password with full alpha, number &amp; special chars.... can be cracked in a very short time, so in this case it's a shallow comfort one is permitted to use special chars on short passwords.\n  \n\n  \nYour best chances here are to got with 14 characters, all lower case is fine because \n    \n    26^14 == 64,509,974,703,297,150,976\n\nThat's acceptable, and can only improve with more character classes like numbers or special chars.

            "comment": "Okay there seems to be a lot of FUD going on around this thread. I'm not a computer security expert, but I know a fair bit about common practices. People have some wrong ideas about password strength and the complexity vs. length debate is misguided in many places. I won't pretend to know exactly what Wells Fargo does, but there are a few things I want to say. \n\n**1. ALWAYS TURN ON 2-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION FOR ANYTHING YOU CARE ABOUT**\n\nThat is all. It is really not acceptable today to not enable 2FA. ESPECIALLY FOR BANKS.\n\n**2. Avoid SMS/Call based 2FA as much as possible**\n\nSMS/Call based 2FA has been ***repeatedly*** been proven insecure many times. It is actually pretty well documented how people do this. First, they call up your service provider since they can tell that by your number. Then they use various social engineering tactics to get your phone number rerouted. Check these out if you want to learn more : [1](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/06/14/deray-mckessons-twitter-account-hacked-with-just-his-name-and-four-digits/) [2](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/how-a-hacker-can-take-over-your-life-by-hijacking-your-phone-number) \n\n**3. SMS/Call based 2FA is better than no 2FA**\n\nJust because there's only SMS 2FA avaliable doesn't mean you shouldn't use it. It is better than nothing. Wells Fargo actually requires you to buy a $25 dollar 2FA device if you want to avoid SMS/Call 2FA, otherwise you'll have to settle for SMS/Call 2FA. That's fine, go ahead and do that.\n\n**4. Your password must be long first then complex**\n\nThe length of your password is a much bigger deal than if lowercase/uppercase is taken as the same. It has to do with the number of tries the attacker has to make before they get in. \n\nNow, I'll try to explain what that meant. Having a very complex password comprised of alphanumeric and special characters with 10 character (ex: b+(8Y@={V/ ) requires 94^10 guesses (lowercase+uppercase+numbers+special character raised to number of characters). This amounts to 5.386151141\u00d710\u00b9\u2079 guesses. Now, lets say your bank *only allows lower case* and you use 15 characters (a phrase which you can remember, ex: unclejohnschips) it amounts to 26^15 which is 1.677259342\u00d710\u00b2\u00b9 guesses. That's 5 more characters than your previous password but about 2 orders of magnitude higher. There's a caveat though if you choose common phrases. There are 'dictionary attacks' possible, which means if you use common words, like 'uncle' 'john' 'chips' they can be used from a list of words to guess, which reduces effective security level. Coming to our next point...\n\n**5. Choose an effective password**\n\nThe approach in the picture I linked isn't the greatest, because common words shouldn't be used. We'll have to modify the same concept in choosing a good password. Now here are my tips to choosing a password. \n\na) Don't choose English\n\nAvoid the English language when your are choosing a password. Use *any* other language possible. This is because there are many tools available to break passwords using the English language because it has become the de facto language of the internet. Choose French, or Hawaiian, or Klingon for all I care, avoid the English language. I will chose a spanish phrase for this example - holasenorcarlos - now this is 15 characters. This is already stronger than our complex password 'b^(8Y@*{V/' going by the number of guesses. Now to make this stronger....  \n\nb) Insert Numbers, special characters strategically. \n\nNow that you've avoided the major hurdle of not using the English language, you've done a great job. Next, start replacing a few characters with numbers. Like this:\n\nh0las3norcar1os\n\nMy reasoning for choosing those numbers should be pretty straight forward. I choose zero for 'O', one for 'L', 3 for 'E \n5 for 'S', etc. because they look similar. A good way to do this is one number per word so you don't get confused. Now you've increased the security level from 26^15 to 36^15. Then start inserting special characters.  \n\n    #0las3nor(ar1os \n    \nHere '#' looks like 'H', and ( looks like 'C' so I replaced that. Alternatively, @ looks like 'a' and '$' looks like S. Now, I've introduced two special characters effectively moving the security level from 36^15 to 68^15 characters. \n\nIf you noticed, I never talked about using capital letters. That would move this much higher to aboout 94^15. We've already reached a high level of security so that won't even matter.\n\n**6. Don't reuse passwords**\n\nThis is actually one of the biggest causes for your getting your accounts compromised. I assume many people have a good password that they use for *everything*. I know this because I used to do that. Don't do this because lets say one website messes up and your passwords are known, now they have your email, which you presumably use for other things, and then your password. So now they can use this combo against common services to see if you have an account there and get in. That's how it happens. \n\n------------------------\n\nTo all the people who will inevitably recommend using password managers, here's my reasoning. You shouldn't store two accounts' passwords in your password manager. One is your main financial account, the second is your main email account password. You never know when you will have access to your password manager and when you wouldn't. Just remember a minimum of two passwords.\n\nComing to password managers, the best password manager is offline, in your brain. The second best place is on a piece of paper in a secure place. Today, password managers are very broken, and the thing is we might *never know* if they are currently broken or not. \n\n**Having said that, we must be pragmatic, and you can't remember all the passwords for all your accounts. So use a password manager, for all your accounts, except your main bank account and your mail email account.** \n\nI would say choose a password manger which is no where near your browser. This means ***no lastpass***. And no to any kind of browser based password manager which automatically fills in passwords for you. This is very, very bad. I can link to a bunch of lastpass exploits that could give away ALL your passwords. And we  don't know if there are any bugs that are known to hackers and are being exploited. What should you use? Use [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/). It will be a PAIN IN THE ASS to use that compared to lastpass, but you will have the confidence a browser/exntension bug won't fuck you over. \n\nNow that we got all that out of the way, go to this website : https://twofactorauth.org/ and start signing up for 2FA **right now**. And choose a good password, slowly start replacing all your password everytime your visit an  important website. It will be hard, but it will be worth it. \n\nEDIT: Changed to say that password manager should be used, **but not for your two most important accounts** - your main bank account and your main email account.",

Is it the best practice from a public perspective? No, but it isn't something that is immediately terrible (unless WF is storing the hashes unsalted. In that case it's pretty bad.)\n\nI'll pose this question, what's the difference between a 10 character case sensitive complex password and an 8 character password that is not case sensitive if I'm trying to guess an accounts password through the logon page and it locks me out after 5 invalid attempts?

We're worried about when (not if) someone gets into the DB, steals Wells Fargo's (hopefully hashed) database of passwords, and begins cracking.  Passwords comprised of two long-ish words and a number (Dave'sPassword1, B@NK_spr1ng_2017) are going to fall in the first few hours.  \n\nIf they're stored plaintext, game over.  If the DB hashes are unsalted and use a weak hash like md5, every 8-10 password can be precomputed and tested in hours or days.  If they're salted, a rainbow table won't work but it will still go pretty quickly as long as the hash is a weak one like md5.  If they're salted and hashed with a deliberately slow hash like bcrypt, 8-10 will do as long as the bank *knows* about the breach -- but if they don't, then when the first passwords start to fall over weeks later, yours will be one of the canaries in the coal mine.  \n\n",

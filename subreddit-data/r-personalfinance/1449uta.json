            "comment": " Your numbers here are very hard to follow and contradicotry.  For PP 1500, you say \"9,000 for family maximum Annual out of pocket 13,500 for family\"  Is it 9k or 13.5k?  For HDHP you so Coinsurance is 7,500, but coinsurince should be a percentage.  \n\nSee [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health\\_insurance/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance/) for an explanation of these terms.",

                            "comment": "One way to look at these is to compare Deductibe+Premium-HSA Contribution across them and also compare OOP Max + Premium - HSA\n\nWith PPO705, you are paying over $3k more per year for coverage.  So you would need to be using a lot of medical care, and coming close to the OOP Maximum every year, in order for that to be a good option. \n\nWith the HDHP you not only pay $1k less than the PPO 1500 but you get $1000 into your HSA to cover your first $1000 of healthcare expenses, plus the benefit of tax deductions on your HSA if you contribute more to the HSA yourself.   So given that the deductible is only $1,500 more, it is likely your best option.  Just take the $40 per paycheck you are saving every two weeks and stick it in your HSA (plus more if you can afford to do so) to cover the deductible.",

            "comment": "I pretty much think of it like this. \nThe higher the premium, the safer you are from major expenses.  When kids are younger and may need trips to the emergency room or you may have a birth this is your best bet. If you can afford it, that is.  If your budget doesn't have a ton of wiggle room then I actually like the HSA plans as the next option.  Because you always get free money from your employer and some of the savings you get with a low premium you can put in the HSA tax-free which will be available for years to come. If you can avoid emergency room visits and you just go to the wellness checks and everyone stays healthy you end up doing pretty well in this scenario.   \n\nI have raised four kids and we usually do the HSA most years.  However if there was an ongoing medical issue I would opt for the higher premium because consistent visits are hard to pay with a high deductible.",

If you pay a high premium(cost per check), your deductible will be lower.  If you pay a low premium, your deductible will be higher.  \nWhen you go to the doctor the charges can be pretty high just a simple doctor's visit is usually about $200 billed to the insurance.   In the 750 plan you have a copay set up. This means that if you go to the doctor you will only pay $25 because that's your copay.   However additional tests or services may be charged.   The payments that you make on the bill will start to be deducted from your deductible.  So eventually if you used a lot of doctors bills and exceeded the $2k deductible, your insurance company will start taking over and pay more for bills.  The smaller copays are nice if you have to consistently go to the doctor throughout the month.  But keep in mind in this setup you are paying more initially every paycheck for this coverage. It would also be nice for a year that you know you have a big medical event.  \n\nOn the HSA plan the deductible is much higher.  When you go to the doctor or emergency room and they send the bill for $200, $500.. whatever it is, since there's no copay on this plan, you end up paying the billed charges.  You can pay the bill with your HSA account.  Its basically a bank account for healthcare.  Your employer is going to put $1,000 into it and you can also opt to put money in to it too.  The money goes in there without taxes so you're saving like 20%.  The benefit of this type of account is if you barely go to the doctor during the year, your premium is low so you never paid a lot for the health insurance.   If you have to go to the doctor a few times for minor things, it's probably covered by the $1,000 and any money you contributed .  However the downfall is if you do need a significant service that cost $5,000.\n For example. You will be billed the $5,000 until your deductible is used up.  Once the deductible is used up then the insurance company takes over and pays for any additional charges.",

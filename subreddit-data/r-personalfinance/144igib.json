    "postText": "I recently joined and have been reading a bunch of posts and am trying to build up a better knowledge/education of finances, so I\u2019m looking forwarded to some good help and information! \n\nI currently have 40k in savings and I\u2019m just curious how best to utilize it. I\u2019m debating between 3 options, really. \n\nSome background: I\u2019m 29 and I just recently graduated with my masters, and am earning about $220k/year with the wife\u2019s salary included. I have $170k in student debts (entirely from the master program) interest free until the Supreme Court makes a decision this fall. I signed the loans at around 5%, although I need to confirm this. So option 1 is to make a massive payment towards these loans. It would drastically cut down on the total interest I would pay, as well as allow me to pay it off sooner. Otherwise the current plan is to have it paid off in 10 years using minimum payments (maybe sooner with extra payments). \n\nOption 2: Investing. We both really want to build up some kind of passive income, ideally through real estate. We live in a very low cost of living area, so entry costs into, say, a duplex or 4-plex, is relatively lower here. But I know several other investment opportunities exist, many, I\u2019m sure, I\u2019m unaware of. Our thought process is using the money for something like this would allow us to pay off the student loans faster by using the profits from the rentals/investment. Once the loan is paid off we then have extra money every month to continue to roll into future investments or simply use for fun. We figure starting sooner is better than later. \n\nOption 3: Putting 3 months worth of expenses into an HYSA. I know I know, what am I thinking considering the other options without an emergency fund. But I have excellent short term and long term disability plans through my company. So my thought process is that although I understand the immense importance of an emergency fund, diverting these funds elsewhere can save us money, or even make us money. Meanwhile, we could then start putting some money away into an emergency fund. \n\nOther potentially pertinent information is that my employer offers a 401k that I\u2019m currently contributing the minimum amount to get 100% match, as well as an HSA that I\u2019m maxing out. They also offer a 403 (b) that they don\u2019t recommend contributing too, as well as a 457 (b) that I\u2019m not contributing to because there isn\u2019t a match. \n\nI\u2019m still learning the best way to attack things. I\u2019ve checked out the flow sheet and I know that says option 3 should be the first thing I do, but I\u2019m just curious what everyone else thinks.",

            "comment": "My understanding is that the proposed student loan forgiveness would only forgive up to 20K of your 170k in loans.  Frankly, I've not paid a lot of attention to the proposal.  I think you're stuck with a lot in student loans you'll need to pay off whether the supreme court sides with the Biden plan or not.  Now if somebody does forgiveness \"right\"-- to include it properly in the budget and to pass legislation through Congress -- then maybe they'll forgive more than 20k.  But I'm unaware of any effort towards that.\n\nSo.  In my opinion you need to plan to pay off the entire 170k...and you can adjust the plan if SC sides with Biden, and you can adjust if Congress actually does something about it.  I like 10 years.  But what does that do for your other familial plans?\n\nYou need at least 3 months in a bank account for an emergency fund.  I'd really much rather see 6 months.  HYSA is fine for that.  But that's not the point.  And you getting injured isn't the point.  I'm approaching 59 1/2 quickly now (I'm within a thousand days of that momentus date), and I've seen a lot in my career.  You don't know what will transpire in the next 30 years that might result in you losing your job.  I've survived mass layoffs undertaken by my employer several times in the past 35 years.  The most agregious was my first...it made the newspapers because one of the people being laid off wasn't in the layoff meeting because his wife was in the hospital in active labor.\n\nHaving an income stream from rental homes might help with that...  but you're a long way from that level of income stream.\n\nOur investing has been 100% in mutual funds...both inside my 401k (where I started), and outside.  Oh...except my gambling account where we gamble on more crazy investments that occasionally pay off.  But I call it my gambling account for a reason.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for all the great info! To clarify, I\u2019m not relying on the actual 20k of debt forgiveness, strictly speaking, I was only saying that the loans are all frozen, so they\u2019re interest free right now, and have been since before I started my masters. So I currently don\u2019t owe anything in interest. I have the option to use the federal governments PSLF program, but if I decide to pay them off myself my salary should allow a fairly aggressive payoff.\n\nThank you for pointing out the possibility of layoffs. To be honest I\u2019m not considering that when I\u2019m looking at an emergency fund due to a fairly stable career choice, although I guess it\u2019s always a possibility and something that should be planned for. \n\nAnd out of genuine curiosity, why would I be a \u201clong way off\u201d of rental income stream? Obviously it wouldn\u2019t be thousands of dollars a month right off the bat, but ideally it would be a property with a fairly positive ROI allowing for at least a few hundred dollars. Maybe I just misunderstand the process though. I\u2019m willing to admit I\u2019m fairly ignorant on this stuff, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here though. \n\nAgain, I appreciate your comment! Lots of good info!",

He's a rabid anti-debt radio personal finance guy that I enjoy listening to, but I don't actually do what he says.  He'd tell you to not buy a piece of property (other than your primary residence) until you can pay cash for it.\n\nPretty rabid, huh?\n\nWhat's rent on a house you might buy around your neck of the woods?  For even numbers, lets say 2k/month.  That's 24k/year.  You're not living off of 24k per year, especially after you set aside for taxes and maintenance.  I've never been a landlord, so I don't really know what those set asides are.  Lets call the net 12k/year.  Four houses is equivalent to a net pay of $23 an hour.\n\n4 houses.  That's why it would take a while.",

I have some friends who swear by him and I like some of his stuff, but I don\u2019t do what he says either lol. \n\nYa those numbers make sense. Again this would just be to provide some external cash flow while keeping my day job. The obvious goal would be to amass enough properties to get close to a livable wage by the time I retire in 30-35 years.",

You can tone that down to ~1 month and the rest into investments. Most investments are pretty liquid in a one month period anyway, and you basically lose out on 2 months of cash per year at some lower yield for almost no benefit. That could be a few hundred or a thousand dollars a year in missed investment earnings, which is money that isn't snowballing for the next 40 years. The time to maximize is now.\n\n \nWait till interest payments start, get that money into an investment option (or housing), and then reassess.",

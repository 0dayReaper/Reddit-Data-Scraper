    "postText": "I know this is a vague question and can vary based on where you're at, but what would you consider a \"good\" budget for 2 adults and 2 toddlers? I'm not in a big city and am closer to \"middle of nowhere\" so relatively low-to-average COL.\n\nMy budget is horrible, probably spending $1200+/month on restaurant/fast food and $500+/month at walmart. I'm trying to drastically cut down the fast food which is an obvious need, but I'm struggling so hard with estimating a grocery budget, particularly with my kids snacking and my wife's junk foods.",

We wfh so do not eat lunch out and kids eat at daycare. Our groceries include things like toilet paper, cleaning supplies, etc.\n\nI'd say we are low, but I'd say your eating out budget is very high.",

Look at your past.\n\nOr start today.  Start writing down *everything* that is being spent on.\n\nOnce you have this data, you and SO can then decide how to reallocate.\n\nBe realistic with yourselves.  Hold each other accountable.\n\nThis is how you come up with a \"good\" budget for your family.",

We clearly aren't doing a good job and probably need outside comparisons to make that more obvious, otherwise we might take our completely absurd budget and shrink it by a small amount and suddenly think we've figured it out.",

Do you find yourself throwing things out?\n\nBut really, $500/mo is perfectly reasonable. Your problem is the restaurant spending, if you want to cut your food budget. Try setting some rules (say, Friday and every other Saturday only for getting restaurant food?) re-assess in a month.",

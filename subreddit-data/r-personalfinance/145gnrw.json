I am reading that those who are \"covered by a retirement plan at work\" may not be eligible to make tax-deductible contributions.\n\nMy employer does provide the option of having a 401k. If I do not open a 401k account, am I still considered \"covered\" for these tax purposes?",

Now these may be less than optimal and laden with fees, etc. But there may also be very good choices, perhaps institutional classes of broad market index funds with very low fees that an individual investor wouldn't qualify for. So I recommend that you investigate the options available in *your* 401k to see if any may be good for you.\n\nThen another issue is, as the other commenter explained, having a preexisting traditional IRA balance makes it difficult or impossible to perform the backdoor Roth IRA maneuver. So that's a concern if you expect your income to rise to that level.\n\nAs to your last question, I've seen anecdotes of people whose employers contribute to their 401(k)s regardless of whether the employee does or not. But it's quite rare.",

It's essentially a way to funnel more money beyond the 22.5k 'limit' by contributing after tax money in your 401k and converting to a roth account. Details here: [https://www.madfientist.com/after-tax-contributions/](https://www.madfientist.com/after-tax-contributions/)\n\nOtherwise I'd continue saving in CDs/HYSA for real estate. Idk where you live but I assume 70k is not sufficient for a downpayment otherwise you would've bought already? I would also not bet on a crash in most markets - in fact I would bet that the bottom was \\~1-2 months ago. My personal conviction on real estate is that appreciation will be far lower for the next \\~1 year (or more if recession) but you will not see a 'crash' akin to 2008.",

Alliant seems to be nice (and was suggested by a friend), and SoFi has a deal with 4.3% at the moment but its unclear how long that will last. Recommendations for institutions are also welcome, but I will be doing my own research regardless.\n\nAlthough in the past I have favored brick-and-mortar banks, I am not against an online account as long as it is FDIC insured, as it seems these have higher APY than my local banks. I currently live in New Jersey.\n\nThanks!",

My question is \u2013should I sell off everything I have in the brokerage fund to pay for the down payment now? Should I sell off $100K, use that for the down payment, and sell a little of the stocks/bonds each year to put towards the mortgage and not face large cap gains taxes all in one year?  Should I try to wait for an opportune moment for either the stocks or bonds to go high and sell? (I doubt the last one but it\u2019s worth asking). I heard that you\u2019re not supposed to make large financial transactions close to the time you buy (is that true?).  I don\u2019t have any debt and am saving the max for retirement each year.",

If the penalty is 9 months of interest and you withdraw the entire amount now, you lose all 9 months of interest which is about $2,108 if my math is right.

Your Roth IRA provides tax diversity in retirement, you can withdraw contributions anytime, and for moderate to high incomes, it\u2019s a relatively small percentage to contribute to that bucket. Remember that you can backdoor money into your Roth IRA when you are over the income limit. Going traditional 401k lowers your tax bill today, which will save most people tax money in the long run, though exceptions exist. If you are not maxing an employer match on 401k, you need to do that immediately. That\u2019s free money you\u2019re not taking, or in other words, a chunk of your compensation package you\u2019re giving up. \n\nMoney in one place is only a benefit if you require the simplicity, or you plan to retire before 59.5 and want to use the rule of 55 to withdraw from 401k earlier, because that rule applies to the funds associated with the employer you separate from. (With regard to your question, remember that you can withdraw Roth IRA contributions anytime, so you don\u2019t have to worry about age of retirement for that portion.) If your holdings are the same in each account, all else being equal, your returns are the same whether you have one account or many. A return percentage on ten $1 bills is exactly the same as on one $10 bill.",

    "postText": "I signed up for a Maid cleaning service where they give you something like a 70% discount on their normal service as long as you pay a small recurring monthly fee. The catch is, per the fine print, you need to stay subscribed for 1 year or more before you cancel, or else you need to pay the full price of every cleaning you had while under the recurring discount. Did the math and it would be cheaper to just wait it out for a year (but still a few extra hundred dollars I'd rather not pay). It's a shady scam, they know what they're doing.\n\nI cancelled my credit card recently because it was stolen and was going through all of my subscription services to replace the card, but I was thinking- does it count as \"cancelling\" the service if my card is no longer valid? Or is my credit card being invalid going to end up with them ringing me up for the full cleaning fees that would normally come up if I cancel?\n\nI'm thinking, they'll no longer have my a valid credit card number, but surely they have my address and other information. I'm not sure if they're legally entitled to force me to pay for this or if cancelling my credit card is just a loophole to get out of this fine-print-trap they put me in.",

Get the cheaper price with a one year contract, or the more expensive price without it.\n\nNo, cancelling your credit card will not save you.  You\u2019ll still get billed.  If you don\u2019t pay, best case is that it gets sent to collections and destroys your credit.  Worst case is that plus getting sued.",

This is an extremely common incentive.  After a year you will be so accustomed to having the service that you might auto-renew at full price.\n\nCell phone, cable etc. often have deals like this.  The difference is, you've decided maid service is optional.",

    "postText": "Sometime last year I went on my first international trip to the Netherlands for a work trip. I was uncertain if I needed physical money or not since I was going to a different town (not Amsterdam), so it was hard to see how things looked.\n\nI withdrew 50 euros from an ATM in an airport since this was last minute and got a singular 50 euro bill.\n\nAlthough at the time it felt good to have something just in case I needed it, I found out that the work trip we went to was isolated enough that we didn\u2019t need physical cash. \n\nOur next trip there is Spring 2024 and that\u2019s if I decide to go. It would be cool to have a smaller bill (whatever the equivalent to $1 is) as a memento, but I figured that I need to find the best course of action to cut my losses for this 50.\n\nIs it best to go to a currency exchange, hold the euro until things get better with the dollar or is there a different place to go to?",

You will likely get $45ish after fees. \n\nIf you need the money sure. If your going back to Europe it likely will be more economical to just hold it till 2024 and use it then.",

Or a drink one evening. Take a train ride or do some sightseeing.\n\nOn a trip - you WILL have some expenses. It's cheaper to pay with cash than to put it on a credit card that will at minimum incur a forex conversion charge.\n\nBank rates for conversions lose money because of the conversion costs and fees.",

It\u2019s one of those work festival type situations in a festival area where most of the things from lodging to food is free. There is a \u201cconvenience store\u201d where we can buy extra things, but they accepted mobile pay.\n\nStill, based off of most responses here, it sounds like if I\u2019m not strapped on cash, it\u2019s best to keep it as an emergency rather than losing money on exchanging it back. Or as you and others say, if I find myself in the situation, just use it as gift/meal money if I\u2019m not in that specific area.",

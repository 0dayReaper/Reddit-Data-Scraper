I\u2019m making about 39k salary, after taxes my paychecks are about 1,100(paid every other week) so the average income per month is 2,200(before bills)\n\nI have been around people who aren\u2019t smart with money so I would really appreciate anyone who could give me advice.\n\nI have a Robin Hood account and would be interested in investing or setting up a IRA/ROTH IRA but I really don\u2019t know what they are besides you save money.",

Next go through the wiki and figure out what you are saving for and where you want to save it. It will vary based on your personal factors.",

You can only contribute 6.5k a year. Put as much as you can in it a year, don't feel bad if you don't max out - just try your best.",

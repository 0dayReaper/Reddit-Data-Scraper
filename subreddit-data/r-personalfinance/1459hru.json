    "postText": "So my fianc\u00e9 and I are planning our wedding and I wanted to save some more money. I thought refinancing my car would be a good start. I\u2019ve got a credit score at 751 and no other debit. \n\nCurrently I\u2019m paying $542.76 a month at 5.15% over 60 months. I have around 2 1/2-3 years left on the payment of $17,746.24. \n\nWith my current bank, I got an offer to refinance for $350.16 a month at 6.84% over 60 months. \n\nI\u2019m thinking maybe trying to lower to 48 months and see what offer I get there. The monthly payment is very tempting, but do you guys think it\u2019s worth \u201crestarting\u201d my loan with a higher interest rate?\n\nThank you in advance!",

So you want to pay even more for your car in the long run, in order to set aside money right now for a party (wedding)?\n\nMy opinion?  Sell the car and get something less expensive if you cannot afford the car payment along with your lifestyle choices.",

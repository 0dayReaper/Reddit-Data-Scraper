    "postText": "Seeking advice on a fair and ethical solution for all parties involved. Background: Parents in need due to economic collapse in Country X.\n\nFather wants to establish consistent residency in Canada.\n\nCurrent situation:\n\n* Child 1 no longer able to host parents due to continuous conflicts with my parents.\n* Child 2 lives abroad but needs Canadian residency for children.\n* Child 3 has a good income and visits Canada frequently.\n* Child 4 (me) has the means to purchase a condo in Canada.\n\nProposed resolution: Purchase a 3-bedroom condo for parents and Child 2. Loan and down payment covered by me, with contributions to mortgage payments from Child 2.\n\nChild 1 suggests involving all children in down payment to reduce loan and share gains upon selling. Unsure of fair percentage split.\n\nAlso considering involving Child 2's partner for equity. Alternately, proceed with current plan, sharing expenses among Child 2, myself, and our father. Concerns include high monthly payments and fairness to Child 2. Emotional factors and past financial assistance from family complicate decision. Seeking guidance and considering rental potential for long-term financial goals.\n\n**Option 1**: Involve all children in down payment and share gains\n\n* All three children contribute to the down payment thus reducing the loan amount and monthly payments (note: this is additional to the 20% down payment I would be contributing)\n* A legal agreement is considered to outline the distribution of gains upon selling the property.\n* Concerns about fairness arise, as Child 2 would benefit the most but Child 1 and Child 3 would also have access to the residence.\n* The specific percentage allocation for each child is unclear. What would be fair?\n\n**Option 2**: Involve Child 2's partner for equity\n\n\\- Child 2's partner contributes to the down payment, making the arrangement more equitable between Child 2 and myself.\n\n\\- The property remains solely in my name.\n\n\\- The percentage of down payment contribution by Child 2's partner is undecided. 50%-50% if down payment is equivalent to mine?\n\n**Option 3:** Proceed as planned, sharing expenses among Child 2, myself, and our father\n\n\\- Stick with the original plan of me covering the down payment and loan, while Child 2 and our father contribute to monthly expenses.\n\n\\- Child 1 and Child 3 are not directly involved financially.\n\n\\- The concern remains about fairness to Child 2, who would benefit from the property the most.\n\n\\- Ethical obligation to allocate a % of gains to Child 2 with agreement to help with monthly mortgage. What would be fair?\n\n**Additional considerations:**\\- Emotional factors, such as past financial assistance and conflicts within the family, add complexity to the decision-making process.- The high monthly payments and my current financial commitments for the next two years create a burden.- The potential rental income from the property is appealing for long-term financial goals.- Child 3's emotional volatility and historical reluctance to support the purchase influence the decision-making process.",

            "comment": "You've not provided anywhere near enough information to even begin to consider this.\n\nHow old are the parents, and do they have any income or any resources to put toward the condo? Will they live there for free for the rest of their lives, or will they contribute any amount toward the down payment, the monthly payments, and/or the ongoing expenses (taxes, insurance, maintenance, etc.)? If the children don't buy this condo, where would the parents live and how what would they live on?\n\nWhy does Child 2 not stand on his own two feet and get his own place that he pays for with his own money? Does Child 2 have any income, or will Child 2 have income after moving to Canada? Are the parents infirm and Child 2 will be caregiver of the parents? Does Child 2 *want* to live with the parents? Forever, or for some more limited period of time? Does Child 2's partner have any desire to participate in this family scheme?\n\nWhat are the respective financial situations of the various children and parents? Does each child have sufficient income and/or resources to put toward the down payment or the monthly expenses without endangering their own financial health? Does each of the children already have their own home, so that having a mortgage on the condo wouldn't interfere with their ability to purchase their own home? Do any of the children besides #2 have a spouse who might have an objection to making such a big financial commitment to support their parents-in-law?\n\nIf the goal is for the 4 children to join together to provide a place for the parents to live for free, the easiest and simplest way would be for each child to contribute 25% of the down payment, pay 25% of the mortgage, and pay 25% of other condo-related costs. And all 4 children would be on the mortgage and the deed. Then after parents are gone, sell it and each child gets 25% of the gain. \n\nOr, if the children don't all have enough to pay 25% each, assign out percentages according to financial ability, keep that percentage consistent across the down payment, the mortgage payments, and other expenses, and divvy out the gains at the end according to those percentages. (For example, Child 1 pays 15% of everything, Child 2 pays 40 percent of everything, Child 3 pays 35 percent of everything, and Child 4 pays 10% of everything, and each child gets that percent of the gain at the end when the condo is eventually sold.)\n\nIf there are other goals in addition to that goal, please clarify what those goals are.",

    "postText": "I want to pur 6k into a Roth IRA account. But, I\u2019m not sure if I should go to a bank or use a diy platform.\n\nI think if I go to the bank they are just going to be condescending and persnickety towards me because it would be my first time. I don\u2019t know if I can trust someone else like that.\n\nOn the other hand , the diy platforms are a bit arduous to research and ascertain which is best.\n\nI essentially, have a few large cap, mid cap, and very few small cap companies in mind. A few S&amp;P 500 ETF\u2019s investments in mind like VOO. Or perhaps CEF\u2019s instead.\n\nI want to put 6k in a roth. Then divide the rest into an investment portfolio of mostly dividend investments + CD LADDERS + a couple HYSA\u2019s. \n\nAn advisor who in actually willing to discuss and not just throw orders and opinion at me would be great. But, I\u2019m realizing is probably highly unrealistic.",

Once you get a more interesting amount of money (say, high five-figs or six-figs), it gets a lot more important to make sure you understand your allocation and make a strategy for it.",

            "comment": "OP, you are kinda all over the map here.  You don't know what you want to do (too many 'options' so you might want to spend a little more time learning and narrowing your focus.\n\nE.g., if I wanted one place to have all of my accounts, I'd probably choose a tool like [Ally.com](https://Ally.com).    I can have my HYSA, build a CD ladder and open/fund/invest in a RothIRA.  One HYSA, one ladder of five 60mo certs or whatever count you like.\n\nIf I didn't like the idea of everything in one spot, there's really no need to have multiple HYSA or CD banks, but if you want to separate your investing/retirement from your emergency fund, open a RothIRA with Vanguard or Fidelity.   If you want a HSA because you have a qualified HDHP, then open that in Fidelity.    What to invest in?  KISS has meaning here.  If one backtests all of these different choices, you'll find a broad collection of different sectors in different funds yields no better and often worse performance than something simply like a 60/40 mix of VTI and VXUS.   As you get older, you might want to adjust by adding in AGG or something similiar.   3 funds, no nightmares.\n\nMore complexity does not mean more profitability.   No advisor is going to do better, unless they remind you to look at your income, your workplace opprotunities for tax-advantaged accounts, your debt load that should be minimal, a 529 for kids, proper budgeting...   good luck finding anyone less than a CFP who will do the whole taco for you.   You can do it.  Read the wiki.",

To be blunt, nothing about your situation and needs is unique, complicated, or special in any way. If anything, you've artificially over-complicated things by focusing on dividend stocks and multiple HYSAs for some reason.\n\nRead the wiki, pick a major brokerage, and get on with your plan.",

            "comment": "Investing in individual stocks is not advised. I've played that game and lost a fair amount of money. Spread your risk in low cost index funds.\n\nCEFs are really only for investors in or nearing the distribution phase of life, i.e. they need investment income to live off of. Some CEFs (and MLPs) can throw off income that is immediately taxable *even if held in a retirement account.* CEF distributions often include return of principal, which will complicate your tax returns, and which *reduce* your cost basis for capital gains tax purposes. Hold the fund long enough and your cost basis can drop below zero, which means if you ever sell, you owe CG taxes on the entire proceeds of the sale... at that point the only strategy is to hold the shares, and let your heirs inherit a stepped-up basis when you die.\n\nIn a brokerage account, you want to buy US Treasuries (highly liquid) instead of CDs (highly illiquid). And brokerages don't offer HYSAs, but the have a variety of money market mutual funds which, for the past couple of years, are yielding more than HYSAs.\n\nStart out simple: Open an account at Schwab, Fidelity, or Vanguard. Open a Roth IRA (you can contribute $6500/year) and invest in a target date index fund, and open a taxable brokerage account and invest in a broad market ETF (for tax efficiency).\n\nTarget date index funds (2055): SWYNX FDEWX VFFVX \n\nBroad market ETFs: SCHB VOO VTI VT",

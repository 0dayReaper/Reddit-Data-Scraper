    "postText": "In august 2022 I bought a GV70 2023. Cost was 55k plus nyc taxes. Total was roughly 60k. I put down 20k and financed around $40,300 at 4.29% interest. \n\nI did get some damage on the car. I hit a dog that ran into the street. Repair cost $1700. The damage was only to bumper and molding/fendor. \n\nAfter driving it for a while with a baby, I\u2019m finding that the size of the car is a bit smaller than I\u2019d like. I wanted to bump up to a gv80 that would fit better for my family needs. Let\u2019s assume the GV80 is around the same price point. \n\nSo here I am, asking you fine people how I can go about this, and how I can calculate how much money I would \u2018lose\u2019 if I followed through. \n\nHousehold income is 180k. Savings per month after every thing is paid is around 5k. Will be close to 6k savings/month in a month or so.",

Even if you finance with a relatively low interest rate, you're throwing away thousands of dollars that you don't need to.",

The reason I\u2019m considering a trade in is because if/when I have a second baby things might get a little too tight. I know trade in not ideal for sure but wanted to hash out my options.",

I wouldn't upgrade just because there *might* be another baby at some cloudy date many months or even years down the road.\n\nBe honest with yourself, and maybe you already are: Do you just want a shiny good-smelling new vehicle? Or is it really, truly a matter of utility? I mean, you don't have to answer to anybody here, but at least answer that for yourself.",

My last car is 14 years now and still going but i hated driving it (sequoia). Which is why I went small. But went a little too small. Another person showed me how much I can end up losing and I think it\u2019s best to just keep it and buy a second car when the time comes.",

You need to price out how much you could trade in or sell the current car for. It\u2019s typically more lucrative to sell private party it\u2019s just a pain.",

Look up your payoff notice from lender. \n\nhttps://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/financial/amortization-schedule-calculator.php\n\nYou\u2019ll have to figure out what your trade in value is, maybe $45k? \n\nSo you\u2019ll net $10k, \u201c$8,300\u201d after the the repair. Complete guess but after 10 months of owning the car nets you a $12,000 loss.",

For example it seems like there's only 0.3 inches more front legroom and only 1.5 inches more rear legroom in the larger car, despite having a much larger footprint. \n\nSource: https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/compare/Genesis-GV80-vs-Genesis-GV70_d3038_d3163",

But it\u2019s not worth losing 5-10k if the stroller will not be used more than another 2 years. Another concern is when we have a second child, we\u2019ll be back to limited trunk space. Another redditor suggested to just save for a second bigger car. We\u2019ll need one eventually so I think I\u2019ve got a decision",

If you're putting the seats down then yeah, it's significantly more, but with 2 kids you won't be putting the seats down and have kids inside at the same time.",

    "postText": "My mother is 81 and in great health. (Walks every day, rides a small motorcycle around town sharp as a tack) \n\nBut as she's getting older I'm wondering what I should do about our house.\n\nWe bought it 15 years ago and at the time we needed to both be on the title and loan to qualify (it is a USDA loan). Since then my mom has been  just moseying around living her life riding her motorcycle but I have paid for all of the housing costs. Bought the house for 300k it's probably worth 800k now, owe about 200k. \n\nAs she gets older I'm worried about medical expenses and how that might impact the house that we all live in. If something happens and there is a long expensive medical saga that drags on for years, is there a possibility the creditors will take my house ? Beyond our home she has no other assets and is on social security and is on some version old people insurance. Not sure about the plan but it's probably the cheapest one. \n\nWe all live together and I have no problem taking care of mom but I'm just wondering if there is a way I should be protecting myself that I don't know about?\n\nTldr-moms getting old. If she racks up an unpayable amount of medical bills can can creditors take the house we jointly own ? \n\nIf so is there anything I can do ? \n\nThanks!",

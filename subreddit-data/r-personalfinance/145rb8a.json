    "postText": "I (18M) am going to a private college (Franklin and Marshall) at the end of this summer to study biology with a likely path of chemical engineering to become a medical pathologist/life scientist of some sort. My parents barely made only a middle class income and I was paid nothing, so I will have to hardly take out loans for the first two years of schooling. \n\nHowever, my mom keeps getting raises and my stepfather just got a cushy job with the TSA, and I just got a well paying summer job. This will likely put our total income at around 90-100k+ during my 4th and possibly 3rd year of college. This means I will likely not qualify for as much grants, even though my parents have around 75-170k in total debt combined. \n\nI'm moving out of state in several months and my mother has said that aside from the occasional thing I will not be getting supported. I've tried to broach the subject of loans with my parents but they just tell me to \"do what you have to\" and that since I'm pursuing medicine I can pay it back anyways. They also told me that people are naturally born with debt and I will have to take out loans regardless of if I gt college or not. Some part of me wants to broach the subject with them again when they start making good money, but I know that it is unlikely they will give me anything. \n\nI'm not sure what I am going to do when my 3rd-5th years of college roll around. I fear I'll have to drop out to not be in permanent lifelong debt or I'll have to work 2-3+ jobs to stay afloat. I do not want that for my future, and I would rather not end up having either possibility come about. \n\nThankfully, I recieved a merit scholarship that will cover 1/3 of my costs, but after my parents new income is put on tax returns I'll likely be paying around 20-40k a year after my sophomore year of college. My community college also gave me a full tuition scholarship, which means it would be mostly free for me, but my parents already payed the enrollment deposit for the out of state school and are saying I have to go there now. \n\nI feel extremely scared for my future and I would appreciate any advice given to me at this point in time. I really want to go out of state but I'm scared at the prospect of having to drop out. \n\nTl;dr: Parents make too much money for financial aid 3rd/4th year + of college, feeling extremely worried I'll have to take on 40k+ in loans. Looking for advice.",

The fact you've ignored my questions about what appears to be the actual cost of attending isn't a great sign, as it appears you are greatly underestimating the costs for just undergrad, on top of zero mention of med school costs. On the US side, this debt appears to be backloaded, so you have years before this becomes a significant issue. That's a good amount of time to recognize the issue and course correct.",

However, since I am working a summer job I'm likely only going to have to take out the 3k subsidized loan in my package (I will be making around 5-8k during the summer). I also got a textbook scholarship that will cover a bit of my textbook expenditures.

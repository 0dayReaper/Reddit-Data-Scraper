    "postText": "I just received a bill out of nowhere for \"services\" provided more than a year ago. The amount the hospital is demanding does not square up with any of my insurance EOBs. I, frankly, thought I was done paying these f\\*$&amp;ers, but apparently not.\n\nWhat, if anything, should I do? I can afford to pay this bill if I have to, but I really thought I was done with everything. Now, I'm dreading the next mystery bill. When will it finally be over?",

Out of network is a whole other story but if they are in network they have a contract with insurance to only bill you correct amount once it's processed by insurance.",

I know from my EOBs and previous bills that I paid that some was in network and some was out of network but covered by my insurance. The bill stems from my child's birth, which involved a less-than-consensual cesarean and my placenta being sent off for lab testing without my being asked or giving consent for the testing. But I've gotten bills previously for this, and I paid my portions and hit my out-of-pocket max last year, so I don't know why I'm getting more bills now.",

It's possible they are late charges, meaning the amount of the bill changed, and the provider hasn't billed the insurance for the additional charges. The provider should only be balance billing you for amounts listed on  the EOB.",

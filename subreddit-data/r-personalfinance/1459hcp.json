    "postText": "Hello everyone.\n\nWife and I are currently saving up money to buy a house and some new cars in a couple of years as our current cars start showing their age. Currently the money is divided but I am not sure if we are going to hit all of our goals on time. Because of this, I am debating between three options.\n\n1. Put as much money as possible to the house down payment and finance the cars.\n\n2. Put a smaller down payment to the house and finance the cars but with a smaller loan than option one.\n\n3. Purchase the cars outright and have a small down payment on the house.\n\nCurrently I\u2019m leaning towards option 1 or 2 since cars are depreciating assets, but I was curious to see what others thought. My main concern is I don\u2019t know the break even point between too much car loan and too little.\n\nSome background information:\n\nCurrent pay is approximately $160k gross a year (wife may stop working in a few years at which point gross take home would be around $100k)\n\nHouse: currently looking at something ranging from $250-$350k with a down payment ranging from $30k-$50k.\n\nCars: currently paid off, would most likely get about $10k for the set. Looking to spend no more than $30k at max( for two cars) with a preferred spending target of $20k total.\n\nNo debt whatsoever between us.",

It's not ideal.\n\nWe haven't had a car payment in 15 years, and my wife and I together have never exceeded $80k in a year, and often we've been well below that (between jobs).\n\nOur cars together are worth about $7,800 (2008 and 2010), but they're both perfectly presentable cars that run well. A little extra maintenance, sure, but we're still WAAAAAY AHEAD of a more expensive, financed vehicle. No interest, lower insurance, lower purchase price -- we've saved thousands and never worried about what we looked like.\n\nWe've survived blow after blow (medical, unemployment, etc.) precisely because we don't borrow money. We even have a completely paid-off house (a topic for another thread).",

Given the numbers you provide, I'd prioritize minimizing mortgage debt to avoid PMI. \n\nYou should generally prefer to take on lower-rate rather than higher-rate debt. There was a time when you should prefer mortgage debt to car debt due to tax deductibility, but for many/most, mortgage interest no longer provides any benefit. YMMV.",

I haven\u2019t had a car loan in so long I don\u2019t know if their interest rates are higher than mortgage rates, but i would guess they are especially for used cars.",

I know housing is constantly moving up or down but I would have a target number in mind so you know when you will reach the goal post.  If you make 160k your yearly savings based on what you are saying should be approximately 40k.  If it isn't you may have to reduce 401k or other expenses (if possible).  I wouldn't forgo a 401k match but I would reduce contributions if that's what it took to get to 20% down when you buy.  That was our goal when we bought a few years ago.",

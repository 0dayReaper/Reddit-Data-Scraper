My wife doesn\u2019t work and stay home with our son. What would be a good life insurance to get that would give me peace of mind that they would payout if I die? I have a history of diabetes in my family and I have pre diabetes and I\u2019m overweight. 5\u20197\u201d 230 lbs. I am working on dropping weight which I think will help. I am the sole breadwinner and I wouldn\u2019t want my wife to have to worry about our mortgage or anything like that. I owe 137k on our home.",

My FIL recently died also, and he had burial insurance and the funeral home director said he hopes the pay because a lot of companies will find a reason no to pay and just refund your premiums. He specifically said Colonial Penn is like that. So I am worried that I may pick the \u201cwrong\u201d company and they not pay out.",

I\u2019m not on any meds now. Just overweight with high numbers due to the weight. Would it be wise to take a gamble and hold off on insurance for a year and work on losing weight? Losing weight would also make my other conditions decrease also. I\u2019m basically asking, if I got a 30yr now at $211, would I be locked in even if I get to a healthy weight, or would the payment go down if I lose the weight?",

It's likely you'll still be able to get that for relatively cheap (a few hundred bucks per year) and it will have your wife and kid covered in case you die young.\n\nNow during those 20 years, also make sure to build up assets and to raise your child well, so that if you were to die 1 day after the policy ends, your kid will be (mostly) independent and your wife will not be poor.\n\nNB. A policy of like $300k or so would be enough to help your wife pivot in case you would die early.\n\nNB2. Consider your wife insuring her life as well: if she were to die, you would also be in slight financial trouble from now having a job *and* a kid and household to take care of. A policy of, again, something like $300k, could help make sure you can pay for childcare /cleaning/food prep while you can continue to work.",

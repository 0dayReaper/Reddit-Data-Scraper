    "postText": "I work for a company that has about 50 employees and uses ADP for payroll. In the middle of May, I noticed that 401k contributions for 3/15 and 3/31 paychecks were taken out of my paycheck (as usual) but did not make it into my 401k account (unusual). Talking to colleagues, I realized it wasn't just me that this happened to, but that I was the first to notice. \n\nI told HR in May - they said they are working on it and told me it would get fixed. As of today, there is still no sign of the money in my 401k account, so I went to check if the contributions had been added and saw that my contributions (and employer match) for two additional pay periods were removed from the 401k. I went to HR again and was met with a response that they are still working on it and blaming ADP. \n\nAm I crazy for thinking my company should be working with more urgency to solve this issue. Is this an issue that happens at other small companies or companies using ADP?",

It's not about cost savings (although that's a factor sometimes), but rather when things go pear-shaped, they can point a finger at the contractor and shift the blame and responsibility for fixing it to someone else.\n\nShould your company be concerned?  Absolutely.  But *can* they do anything more than open a ticket with their processor?  Probably not...",

So my account balance is 4 contributions short of what it should be - the two contributions missed in March and this recent removal from account. \n\nCan you explain why that would happen?",

    "postText": "My friends financial advisor told them managed funds are better than mutual funds for people with more money (roughly &gt;2 million). However, this doesn\u2019t seem quite right to me. The fees on the managed fund are really high, .9% for the firm and like .2-.3% in fees for the actual funds. My fees on my mutual funds (vanguard) are like .04-.1%. Their argument was that even though the fees are higher, managed funds are better for taxes. They also said mutual funds have high transaction fees. I\u2019m not doing anything fancy to optimize tax, I\u2019m just investing in 3 vanguard mutual funds and rebalancing as needed. Is this a strategy that doesn\u2019t work when you have more money? How much do you need to know to manage your money if you have a lot?",

More transactions = more capital gain distributions, short term gains, unqualified dividends, etc. \n\nIf talking about tax harvesting, you can do it yourself with mutual/ETF index funds. A manager can't influence the market to make the condition more favorable to you.",

And a manager can't lower the expense ratio of funds either. Instead, they are likely going to steer your account towards high-fee funds because those tend to provide kickbacks to the advisor.",

It's their full time job.\n\nIf you are comfortable holding indefinitely you can certainly wait out recessionary periods. But your assets will certainly appreciate/compound to higher magnitudes if you experience positive year over year returns.\n\nExample if you held during pre-covid to where we are now in something like the SPY, you would certainly have seen appreciation.\n\nBut if you exited pre crash, or even shorted pre crash. And went long from the bottom you'd see a much higher degree of growth.\n\nIt is very hard for an average trader to capture these movements but a good hft / quant firm should have no issue staying \"ahead of the curve\"\n\nFind an advisor that specializes in servicing high net worth clients, and has a long standing history and credibility. Imo that is the best way to proceed in your circumstances.\n\nShop around until you feel comfortable with your choice, and if you end up feeling you can outperform them. Just go in slowly with your capital and dca into an index fund to minimize short term downside potential.",

Managed funds (SMA)  offer plenty of benefits over their mutual fund counterparts and are popular with higher net worth clients.   A SMA would not have more transactions as they are the same portfolio.... The Mutual Fund with a single line item / CUSIP and the SMA with the actually equity holdings. This allows more customization if needed and increased tax benefits.   This is just an extremely basic example but customization is such a huge benefit for higher net worth clients. \n\nMutual funds also pay out capital gains distributions, in a positive environment regardless if you sell the fund. Individual names cannot be sold in the fund as they can in a SMA.   This is a benefit ETFs have over mutual funds as well, no cap gain distributions. \n\nIf you're talking about index funds, those are a bit different but direct indexing is also a popular strategy with high net worth individuals and has place.  Index funds are extremely low fees and do just as the name, implies....mirros an index. These are basically what most people need",

            "comment": "I have a managed fund.  All it was used for was for churning by the FA.  they bought whatever Merrill Lynch was underwriting and generated commissions for themselves, meanwhile, our account had 175 stocks, quite a few of them were one share of Joe's Grocery Store based somewhere.  I made up the name, I still have the list of the stocks when I had had enough of the idiot,\n\nAfter years of pushing and prodding, I agreed to rollover my brokerage accounts I had into my spouse's managed account.  I was against it, but I wasn't actively trading my accounts anymore as I went buy and hold and hold and hold.  \n\nAt this point, I looked at the portfolio, and I was shocked.  Why buy one share of some company if there is $150,000 in cash in the money market and the stock is selling for $13 per share.  I don't think $1300 bucks was going to break it.\n\nI attacked the list and sold over 100 stocks to pare down the portfolio and gave instructions they cannot buy anything without both of our approval.  Guess what, they still do.  I have to question him every other month and then I just get pissed.\n\nI also hate how they can just sell stocks because some stocks have become more valuable thereby, making up too much of the portfolio, and they can sell the stock.  To balance the portfolio, it is in the contract, and then buy some shitty mutual fund.  guess what the mutual fund has?  Front end load, which means commission for the financial advisor.\n\nJust typing this is making my blood boil.  again.\n\nI have been tasked with creating a new brokerage account, and moving all of our stock investments to it, these are dividend reinvestment plans.  I told my spouse, i will move all of our stocks into one account, but it is NOT going to the financial advisor.  My spouse agreed as long as I do all the work.  Little does she know, that when I get that accomplished, we are moving the managed account away from the family member.",

            "comment": "No there have been studies about this. The vast majority of managed funds do not outperform the market in the long term when you account for the fees. It's impossible to predict which funds will outperform. In fact, the best predictor for the long-term performance of a fund is the fee (The higher the fee the lower the expected returns).\n\n[https://us.spindices.com/documents/spiva/spiva-us-mid-year-2018.pdf](https://us.spindices.com/documents/spiva/spiva-us-mid-year-2018.pdf)\n\n&gt;\"Similarly, over the 15-year investment horizon, 92.43% of large-capmanagers, 95.13% of mid-cap managers, and 97.70% of small-capmanagers failed to outperform on a relative basis.\" - SPIVA\u00ae U.S. Scorecard\n\nOver a 15-year period over 90% of active funds failed to outperform. Do you feel lucky enough to pick one of the funds that happened to outperform the market (Likely due to luck not skill since with so many funds you would expect some to do well just by chance). If you'd rather trust the professionals than the numbers this is what Warren Buffet (Arguably the most successful investor of all time) had to say on the matter.\n\n&gt;\u201cMost investors, both institutional and individual, will find that the best way to own common stocks is through an index fund that charges minimal fees. Those following this path are sure to beat the net results (after fees and expenses) delivered by the great majority of investment professionals.\u201d  - Warren Buffet\n\nTheir excuses are baloney as well\n\n&gt;Their argument was that even though the fees are higher, managed funds are better for taxes.\n\nThis tends to be the reverse if you are investing in popular passive ETFs [https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-tax-efficiency](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-tax-efficiency)\n\n&gt;They also said mutual funds have high transaction fees.\n\nNot sure why he is talking about mutual funds here. Most passive investors go with ETFs. Many brokerages will not charge transaction/commission fees for their ETFs and popular ETFs tend to have a very small bid/ask spread.\n\n&gt;How much do you need to know to manage your money if you have a lot?\n\nInvesting isn't hard you can start here [https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:Bogleheads%C2%AE\\_investment\\_philosophy](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Video:Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy)\n\n&gt;Is this a strategy that doesn\u2019t work when you have more money?\n\nWarren Buffett wrote that after he passes, the trustee of his wife's inheritance has been told to put 90% of her money into a stock index fund and 10% into short-term government bonds. So if index funds are good enough for billionaires then no you don't make too much money.\n\nMany financial advisors get cutbacks for recommending high fee funds. And If simply investing in a broad market ETF is all you have to do then what do you need a financial advisor for? So they have an interest in making these things seem more complicated than it needs to be so you need them to help navigate.",

Its either better or worse objectively for everyone.\n\nI believe there certainly are times a particular managed fund will beat indexes even after considering added feed and more tax drag. Question is which fund is it going to be, and no one knows that.\n\nTo beat indexes with managed funds on average then on average managed funds would have to beat out indexes by more than their expense ratios and tax drag. You can look that up.  They dont.\n\nAs for tax loss harvesting well that isnt exactly hard.  End of the year..fund up in value? Keep fund. End of year fund down on value? Sell shares that represent that loss immediately buy a similar fund with that money then after a couple months sell that and buy your original fund back...or just keep the similar fund too. Claim loss as a tax deduction up to $3k a year or use it against other cap gains as much as you like.  You want to pay me a couple thousand to push those buttons for you so you can save a couple hundred bucks be more than happy to.",

            "comment": "You are using the words \u201cmanaged funds\u201d as a differentiated investment strategy over \u201cmutual funds\u201d. You can have passive index mutual funds, or actively managed mutual funds. The only rationale I can see from this as a clue is the advisor said for people with greater than $2 M it makes sense. It sounds like he also said it is better for taxes. The only way I can think those two apply in this situation is if he is referring to \u201cSeparately Managed Accounts\u201d (SMA\u2019s). The fee structure on SMA\u2019s are usually lower than actively managed Mutual Funds, and you referred to fee structures of .2-.3 for the funds, that\u2019s about half the cost or more from a normal actively managed mutual fund. So those three things make me think the advisor is talking about SMA\u2019s as \u201cmanaged funds\u201d. The minimum investments for SMA\u2019s can range from usually 25/50 k to 500-1M. So for a diversified portfolio using SMA\u2019s yeah you\u2019d probably want a $2 M portfolio or larger. SMA\u2019s are where you own the securities outright versus in a basket like a mutual fund. It does have its pros/cons. \n\nI\u2019d ask your buddy if this advisor is talking about SMA\u2019s or Actively Managed Mutual Funds. If the latter, run, simply can\u2019t be true those are more tax efficient. If the former, the advisor has a leg to stand on but clearly your friend doesn\u2019t have a good enough understanding to use these vehicles if explained this way. KISS.",

Performance wise I can\u2019t speak to at all without knowing what exactly it is. Tax wise, yes, I think it is fair to say you could be more strategic in harvesting tax losses within an SMA structure vs. a Mutual Fund or ETF structure just by the very nature of the platform. You can get an SMA that delivers essentially the SP500 return profile minus the fee. Really hard to get solid advice on a Reddit thread, but take the info and ask the right questions to an advisor. If they don\u2019t have a comprehensive reply to the Q\u2019s, that doesn\u2019t use confusing jargon, I\u2019d take pause. SMA\u2019s aren\u2019t unique any longer, the brokerages and wires both offer them.",

My reasoning, is that in down markets, they will be actively managing your assets and mitigating risks and losses. If they are a good firm they should be returning positive yields, regardless of the market trend. At that wealth level, aside from growth a huge goal is conservation. \n\nOtherwise its not really worth it, just stick it in the SPY and wait it out through the ups and downs.",

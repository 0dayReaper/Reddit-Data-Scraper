    "postText": "I'm a 19 year old about to turn 20. I am also coming up on my 2nd year living away from my parents - not a coincidence. This might be a bit long, but I would really appreciate any advice as someone who doesn't have anyone to ask.\n\nI'm in the process of transitioning from a $17.05/hr job with fairly set hours of 35 a week to a $20/hr job with the option to work and get overtime as much as I want. I'm also a full time student, so this is kind of perfect. For the past 6 months, I've been putting away $1,000 a month. In March, I opened a Goldman Sachs saving account and moved all of my savings over.\n\nHere's the dilemma. My lease is ending in July, and I just lost my health insurance (Medicaid) that I was on under my mom. I've reapplied, but I make more money than my mom and don't have kids, so I'm not hopeful. I have severe chronic asthma and my medications alone, aside from doctor's apps and the therapy I was going to, are $300. Not necessarily a month, and I can probably stretch a 3 month inhaler to 6 if needed. \n\nMy lease is up in about a month now. I chose not to renew after one of my roommates was late on rent by over a week, forcing me to take money out of my savings. She still has not paid it in full.\n\nI don't have any roommate prospects as neither of my roommates seem financially stable enough to sign a lease with, so I'm likely going to need to move into a studio which will be $1,000-$1,200. This is opposed to the ~$600 a month I was paying before. I can't move into a cheaper, old apartment - I have tried this, and if a place happens to have mold it could very possibly kill me. Most of them have mold. Well, all of them in my experience, but I'm sure one or two might not. My other roommates are facing homelessness, and I'm trying to help them as much as I can without being willing to contribute financially or live with them.\n\nI still want to put at least a grand away a month, but I also want to grow my savings. The savings account is one thing but I feel like I may need more. I don't qualify for government assistance anymore so there is no help in that regard. I suppose I'm technically disabled, but I'm not willing to live under the conditions disability implies if it's avoidable.\n\nCurrently I have no student loans because I'm at a tech school. I will definitely be needing car repairs soon - nothing too expensive, under $300, but I'm scared I may need a new car entirely at some point soon. This one is 14 years old. My credit is very good for having started it less than a year ago.\n\nI want to buy a house by the time I'm 25. I want to afford kids. I want to go to college.\n\nHow can I better achieve these goals? Is living in the studio a horrible decision, and should I very quickly find a roommate? Is there any way to expedite the home-ownership part of this? How can I grow my savings more?",

            "comment": "I think you need to put a pause on planning for home ownership. While it\u2019s great to aspire to it, that\u2019s something that will be very easy for you to start planning for once you\u2019ve finished school and are working full time, and very difficult to plan for until you\u2019re at that point and know what your income and debt situation is long term. \n\nMost people who are financially independent find themselves in survival mode while in school, so the fact that you\u2019ve been able to put $1k/month away is amazing. Do you feel like you have a decent emergency fund saved up at this point? That would be a focus to help you with things like unexpected medical bills, car repairs, floating you if you lost your job. \n\nHealth insurance- does your school offer student health insurance? My university did and it was reasonably priced, but I\u2019m not sure if this is something offered at a tech school. If not, I think 35 hours/week might be enough to get it through your employer so check there. Some employers heavily subsidize the cost (although most don\u2019t) but that\u2019s going to be your starting point \n\nApartments- what is the cost of a comparable 2 bedroom in your area? If it\u2019s just a little bit more, it might make sense to get the 2 bedroom and work on finding a reliable roommate quickly. But, it does sound like you can afford the studio and will just be saving less each month. if you have a well funded emergency fund and can figure out if health insurance will fit into your budget, I think it can make sense so you don\u2019t have to worry about your roommates making  rent every month",

I thought these two might be a bit better at it since they're in their 30s, only to find one lied about being homeless before she came here and the other tanked their credit on a used Mustang just prior.\n\nNeither my school or work offer health insurance",

Health insurance is expensive and an employer that covers a large portion of it is a big financial benefit. Maybe not enough to outweigh the schedule flexibility you\u2019re getting (esp the ability to earn more with more hours), but something to consider",

There's really no drawbacks to that even if I choose to live alone for the entirety of the lease! Thank you so much.\n\nAnd yeah, I agree - this is a temporary position for the duration of a campaign for a certain candidate. I've been working in an ER for the past year, and will be going back to that after this. I think working this position for the time being is worthwhile as long as my health stays relatively stable. The cost of my medications and even the cost of therapy, as long as I'm able to spread out my medications to make them last a bit longer than they normally would, would probably cost the same if not less than it would with any kind of decent insurance.",

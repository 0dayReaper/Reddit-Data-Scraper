    "postText": "I have about $250k of liquid funds that I am considering using to apply to one or more of my mortgages. I have no issues making the loan payments and no other debt.  I'm just trying to balance making the best financial decision against the temptation to have one or two less mortgages in the near future. The problem is the loans I can pay off have the best rates comparatively.\n\n  \nLoan #1: Rate: 3.375% , principle balance about $145k  \nLoan #2: Rate: 4.5%, principle balance about $117k  \nLoan #3: (New loan just closed) Rate: 5.25%, principle balance $575k\n\n  \n\\#######################################################################  \nOption 1: Pay off loans #1 &amp; 2 almost in full. Based on the rates this is mostly just for moral.  I'd be down to one mortgage and it would free up about $2k a month in P&amp;I payments. The con is that these are my lowest rate loans.\n\n  \nOption 2: Just pay off loan #2 and decide what to do with the remaining funds.\n\n  \nOption 3: Pay off a chunk of loan #3. This seems to make the most sense financially, however there is no immediate benefit as I'll still be paying three mortgages. Perhaps I can refinance in a few years and see the benefit of a greatly reduced payment, but there is no guarantee.\n\n  \nOption 4: Do nothing and start a CD ladder and/or some other safe investment to grow the funds.\n\n  \nOption 5: Something I'm missing?\n\n  \nI really can't say I have a preference.  I want to make the best financial choice, which I think is option #3 or #4 depending on what I can get for returns.\n\n  \nAny feedback would be appreciated.",

            "comment": "Are you done buying houses? I ask because if you can close out a mortgage it would lower your DTI and thus make it easier for you to get another mortgage.  However if you are done then makes more sense to just apply it to the higher interest loan.\n\nI see zero reason you would start a CD ladder when you have a 5.25% loan.  Keep in mind even if there was a 6.5% CD it wouldn't be worth it because CD interest is taxed as income.",

    "postText": "I switched employers and rolled the 401k from it into into my Vanguard IRA. I already filed taxes for 2022.\n\n**The problem is that I had excess deferrals in the 401k but I didn't know and then had already rolled it over to my IRA.**\n\nThe letter states that I had $2104 dollars in excess with a gain of 0 since last year the market year ended badly.\n\nUpon doing research on the internet it looks like I can just call Vanguard and have them remove the excess, and then file an amended 1040x with a note saying that I had to amend because of an excess. \n\n**What I'm concerned about is what about the gains that have accrued since I had rolled over?**\n\nSurely it won't be the $2104 since I know for a fact that the market has been on the up. Perhaps it'll be something like $2200.\n\nDoes Vanguard know how to calculate this? Will I receive yet another 1099 R from Vanguard next year?\n\nThanks in advance.",

Then they'll distribute the excess to you.\n\n* If they are fine with you removing the excess yourself, just tell your IRA provider to do it. You'll need to tell them how much was the excess (without adjustments), how much was earnings/loss, and how much total to actually remove.",

To their systems, they only see one lump sum contribution being rolled in instead of a table with transaction information. I do however have the amount to go by that was provided by my old 401k provider. Both excess and gains (which was 0).",

The 401(k) provider should know the amount that needs to be removed before the rollover (your excess contribution + any gains/losses). It sounds like you already have this number. If you tell Vanguard the number, Vanguard can walk you through the rest and take care of the calculation for the gains/loss that occurred at Vanguard.\n\nSource: I used to work at Vanguard and would do this.",

I would try to call while the stock market is open (9:30 AM EDT - 4 PM EDT) because sometimes we are able to do the entire calculation over the phone if the market is open (instead of having you fill out an online form). When the Vanguard phone prompt asks you what you want to do, say you want to do an Excess Removal. The voice prompt should route you accordingly and hopefully help you skip getting rerouted.",

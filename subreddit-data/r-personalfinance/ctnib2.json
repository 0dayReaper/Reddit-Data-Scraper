    "postText": "I bought a townhome in 2009 that I now use as a rental property. Last summer when I was visiting the home I noticed the floor in the kitchen had sunk a couple inches. I'd heard previously from my neighbors that they'd had the same problem.\n\nWhen I bought the home, the builder had given a 2/10 warranty which covered the any defects in the foundation for 10 years. I decided to pay the $200 to submit a claim and have them inspect, fully expecting they'd find some reason to deny my claim, but they didn't.\n\nToday I have a check in hand for $38,000 and a bid from a contractor to make the repairs. If I hadn't thought to check my warranty or if I'd waited even 6 months my warranty would have expired and I would be paying that out of my own pocket.\n\nDon't forget to check to see if your repairs are warrantied.",

It might not be a perfect bell curve, but it's also not going to be a flat line that spikes up to a high value after one day.\n\nIf you design the device so the peak of that curve is warranty plus one day, you're going to have a fuckton of devices that fail before warranty is up. It's probably more like warranty plus six months, or a year, with some expected early failures.",

Called and it was a month away from expiring. ASUS ended up having to upgrade me to the next model up cause they no longer had the part needed for my model.\n\nThis was back in maybe 2011 or 2012. To this day, nothing like that has happened to me again.. yet.\n\nEdit: And I'm still using this laptop. It's in front of me now. i7-3610QM, 16GB RAM, and a GTX660M. It's getting dated but still plenty fast for all my tasks especially after I put an SSD in it a few years ago and it also has a second HDD.",

Some items in Australia aren't worth getting an extended warranty on though, as we have statutory warranties for most big ticket items, ie: the statutory warranty for a fridge may allow for it to last 10 years with basic maintenance, so if it stops working after 3 years the manufacturer may still be responsible for repairs/replacement even if their explicit warranty is only 2 years (made up example, I don't know the legal statutory warranty for a fridge and this assumes no negligence from the owner, such as dropping it, hanging off the doors or the like)",

The number of borings they choose depends on the risk they are willing to take. \n\nI\u2019ll always remember one project for a large house where they started without a geotech report. The contractor started on the septic tank first, and found a bunch of buried trash right below the ground surface. Our exploration found the entire lot had buried trash. Several feet of any house hold trash you could imagine. It was a gigantic lot, several acres in size.",

Our home was built in the 70s and still had the same windows from then. We installed all new windows in the home, they looked good, worked great, and had better insulation. And to top it off, he had a X year warranty, can't remember the amount of yeara.\n\nAfter a year or so, one of the windows had an issue that I can't remember. Wasnt major, called the guy to fix it, and apparently he had shut down his company. Then I found out it was common among contractors.\n\nCreate a company, do work, provide warranty for X years to pacify any doubts, shut down once a few too many people start requesting warranty work. \n\nIts actually kind of disgusting. I wish the US made some kind of rules about this issue. Its lightweight deceiving for people who think they'll get the lifetime of the warranty.",

I've had several claims: water heater, furnace blower, AC compressor, AC fan, clothes washer... in those 12 years I figure I've just broken even on the cost. The hassle of filing a claim and having to work with the chosen contractor is a cost, also.",

Some houses in our neighborhood were stucco which had water damage that our builder denied warranty on so those homeowners sued. The homeowners won and it covered every house in our neighborhood including my parents. We didn't see or know about any damages until they came out and had to replace some sections of roof, window frames, and every exterior entrance. Total came out to about $100-150k. They're currently working on it so who knows, they could find more damages. Also, the stucco houses were closer to 200-250k since they had to replace most of the exterior on top of the window frames and exterior doors.",

My mom's place was under warranty when something in the centralized A/C unit broke down. Long story short, they tried to blame it on something else and tried to say it wasn't covered. Ended up getting their own guy to take a look (for free) to diagnose, then going back to the builder to tell them they were full of shit on several levels. Moral of the story: always do your best to educate yourself about whats going on. Don't get greedy but fight for what is yours.",

So about 6 months in the water started to not get as hot. From the inspection we knew the water heater was near the end of life, so I thought this is great because the warranty could pay for a new heater. So call up the warranty, pay the $75 fee and an inspector comes. He walks up to it, and turns the temperature setting from low up higher.... It turns out that right before the water got cold we had a new heater installed, and they had to turn the water off because of the gas. When they turned the water heater back on, they put it on low.\n\nOh well.",

The hot water tank was only 3 years old and started to leak out of the flue pipe. Called the home warranty company, they send out a plumber and he immediately finds that they ran the copper ground wire from the breaker box to the pipe on the water heater. Metal reaction may have corroded it faster than normal, plus it\u2019s obviously not code. \n\nHome warranty company says that since the water heater is only 3 years old, I have to go through the manufacturer warranty. However, the seller never transferred the warranty to me and had only 30 days after closing to do this per Rheem\u2019s website. Plumber was cool and says it\u2019ll be $900 for him to do it and fix all code violations with it and I\u2019m welcome to get other quotes. \n\nI figure what the hell, can\u2019t hurt to call Rheem and put in a claim. Worst they can say is No. So I call them up and it turns out the owner never registered the water heater in the first place.  \n\n\u201cAre you the homeowner?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re damn right I am. Told me to just take it to Home Depot and they\u2019ll give me a replacement. While I was there I picked up a 8\u2019 copper ground rod too that I drove into the ground and wired the ground wire to. \n\n$900 job turned into a $15 job.",

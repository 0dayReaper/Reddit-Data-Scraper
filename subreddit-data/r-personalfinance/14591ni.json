    "postText": "I\u2019m buying my spouse out of the house with refinancing my new mortgage payment will be 1900. Do you think this is too tight for my take home of 4400 monthly? (Base pay) I\u2019ve tightened down my budget and automated $500 going into savings every month but I couldn\u2019t give up the house. With a 2-3 bedroom the rent would also be 1500-1800 if I got an apt. As I have two kids as well. Just will be tight as my mortgage is going up 900 a month to get her off the deed.",

I would do a detailed budget based off of what you have actually spent the last 3-6 months (ie look back at your accounts), adjusted for other known upcoming expenses (child care, braces, activities, car/house maintenance.)",

And it looks like you can make it work, but I think you are not going to have a lot of room for fun money for a while.",

So I\u2019m just determined to make it work. \n\nHistorically I liked eating out. So I essentially cut that out to maybe 1 time a month or something. I\u2019m cutting out YouTube TV (80 a month), just keeping Netflix. My phone bill will go down 80 bucks without the wife on it any longer as well. I think I can do it. I have around 8k in savings. Was a lot more but unfortunately it went to the lawyers on this thing. So number 1 priority is building it back up.",

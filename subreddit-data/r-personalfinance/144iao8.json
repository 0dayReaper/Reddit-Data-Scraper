    "postText": "\n\nHello folks,\n\nI have moved recently to US. I thought that i was financially literate. But I suspect that I have dug myself into a hole.  I do not have a sense of path forward. Status quo will not resolve my problem. I would really appreciate if this group could tell me  of any possible  solutions. ( other than working till i die) Here are the details\n\nI am 50 years old. Moved to US about 3 years ago. I work as a manager in one of the IT companies in California. I earn about 0k 250k year. I am married and my daughter has moved out. She is independent.\n\nMy assets\n401k - 100k\nStocks - 200k (most  of it earned before moving to US)\nHSA - 15k\nHome equity - 200k\n\nLiabilities\nCar loan 20k\nCC debt - none\nMortgage - 700k (home cost at 900k) 30yr fixed at 5%.  Monthly outgo of about 5k ( mortgage + utilities)\n\nMy investments are in low cost index funds. I tried financial advisers but found them to be pushing their agenda. I used to max out 401k but with new home, I can't.\n\nMy job  is stressful and I can work for another 15-20 years. My current job pays well but there are not many employers paying that much. If I lose my job, I will be able to pay bills but won't be able to save much.\n\nI suspect that my financial future is bleak.  When I stop working, I would still have mortgage and not much money. My only option would be to move back to my home country ( an European country with low cost of leaving)\n\nWhat does this group think? How am I doing? Is my situation as bad as I suspect? Is there anything that I should be doing? I would appreciate your thoughts.\n\nTIA",

But try to pay off as much as you can in 10 years, sell the house and buy something cheaper in cheaper states.  And try to build investment portfolio to at least 1m. If you are able to buy a  house with cash in 10 years in a cheaper area then 1-1.5m might be enough",

            "comment": "TL : dr : Figure out the acceptable retirement options, then work backwards. Retiring in place in California needs the most (to cover mortgage, living expenses and healthcare). Moving to a LCOL in the US / moving to another LCOL country can bring down the need.\n\nNext : Assess how much you'd get from Social Security, and how much the gap to your preferred retirement would be.\n\nNext : optimize your assets and savings; look at how to make it more efficient, plus if there are ways to boost your saving rate.\n\n&gt; I suspect that my financial future is bleak.\n\nI disagree - you have plenty of options, it's more about defining your strategy and then moving towards it.\n\n&gt; My only option would be to move back to my home country ( an European country with low cost of leaving)\n\nIF you have no issues about going back to your home country; with a sizeable saving + a low cost of living, you would be comfortable.\n\nIF you don't want to go back to your home country but do want a low cost of living - there are alternative locations. Some US citizens with lower retirement income and savings look at locations like Panama / Costa Rica etc. or even LCOL locations within the US to manage their retirement.\n\nKeep in mind that if you are able to work for at least 7 years more (total 40 quarters of FICA taxes) - you become eligible for Social Security. Your wife would also become eligible for spousal benefit. If you have some pension / retirement benefit from your home country - that may impact the amount of Social Security benefit you can claim because of the Windfall Elimination provision; check if that applies, and also check the likely range of benefit you may get.\n\nSince you won't have the full 35 years; your benefit may be lower (1K - 2K range); your wife's spousal benefit (if she doesn't work and doesn't have social security on her own) would be at max half yours. \n\nThat said - with even 1.5K per month in combined social security benefits - retiring in a lower cost of living / lower cost of healthcare location is possible.\n\n&gt; My assets 401k - 100k Stocks - 200k (most of it earned before moving to US) \n\nWith about 300K in the markets - assuming an average return of 7% in tax advantaged accounts - you'd get to around 800K in 15 years and around 1.1M in 20 years.  \n\nAnd if you can steadily max out your 401K - you can add another 500K to 1M with that.\n\n\n&gt;  If I lose my job, I will be able to pay bills but won't be able to save much.\n\nThis is the kicker; you need to assess how secure your job is; what your alternative income may be; and how to manage the situation if that occurs.\n\nIf you were sure about your job staying for 15 years+ - you could look at liquidating your stocks to pay down the mortgage principal; take it down to 500K instead of 700K - and therefore cut your mortgage instalment by about 29%. If your total mortgage payment (principal + interest) is 4K per month, you'd cut out around $1150 from the instalment.\n\nWith that reduction in instalment - you'd have $13800 to add to maxing out your 401K (and making the investment in tax advantaged accounts). Assuming you're in the 24% tax bracket; that would save another 3.3K of tax or more helping you max out the 401K without dipping into the rest of your income.\n\nIt may make sense to do a different strategy : Max out your 401K (and therefore tax savings) and possibly add an IRA for additional savings to the maximum possible; and liquidate out maybe $20K per year from your stocks to cover the shortfall towards your home payment if you can't cut expenses elsewhere.\n\n&gt; Home equity - 200k Mortgage - 700k (home cost at 900k) 30yr fixed at 5%\n\nHouse : Yes - with 700K of mortgage on a 30 year loan and only 15-20 years to work - when you retire, you will have an outstanding mortgage to still pay when you retire.\n\nOptions here other than the pay down of principal that I mentioned before.\n\n1) Watch the interest rates; if you can refinance down to a lower rate in the future, do it. IDK if we'll get back to the low 2.x% that was there during the pandemic; but if we get back to even 3 / 3.5% rate, you may find a refinance beneficial.\n\n2) Keep in mind that CA property values have been going up for a long time; IF that trend continues, you may be house-rich and liquidity-poor at the time you retire. If you don't have enough money / savings from other assets / savings, you may still be able to sell this house, take advantage of upto 500K of capital gains exemption - and buy another house at half the price or less (whether you move to Stockton / Modesto to remain in CA; move to other lower cost states; move to a low COL country). Either way - you would release out a lot of capital + have a home with no debt.\n\n3) Or even - if it makes sense : rent out the property; in 15 years time, rentals may rise enough to cover both the mortgage + cost of renting in a LCOL location.\n\n&gt; I earn about 250k year. I am married and my daughter has moved out. \n\nGross income of 250K. Empty nester household of 2 people. Guessing you may have about 150-170K as takehome after maxing out 401K; taxes and other deductions; say 12.5K - 14K per month\n\nHousing expense of 5K; car expenses of ~1K; other expenses say 2-3K. That adds up to between 8-10K.\n\nLook at your expenses; create a budget. You SHOULD be able to put away an additional 2K per month or more towards savings. Or to pay down the mortgage faster, if that makes sense.\n\nIf you can save this additional 2k / month after maxing out your 401K and IRA - that would over 15 - 20 years build up to a sizeable amount. Depending on how you invest and compound it - you may add anywhere between 500K - 1M through this.\n\nTo summarize : ~1M + from your current assets compounding; ~300-500K from maxing your 401K + IRA; ~500K - 1M from your other savings. Home possible appreciation, and mortgage maybe paid down to leave ~400K outstanding; your home equity would be substantial enough to cover buying a home elsewhere free and clear.\n\nAt the low end : with 2M in 401K + IRA + other assets and possibly 500K in home equity : that may not sustain stay in CA or even in continental US (or you'd have to live very frugally and provide for healthcare / eldercare at exorbitant rates). You'd probably be better off planning a move to a lower COL country.\n\nAt the high end : nearer 3M in assets + a home; you may be able to live in a LCOL area of the US and have a reasonable life. May not sustain retiring and staying put in CA current home.\n\nIf you do get a substantial extra; maybe if your income increases / your wife gets a job and saves substantially; your investments grow much faster - then you may have an option to stay put.\n\nBest wishes.",

    "postText": "Due to my spouse starting their own business during COVID and running into issues with cash flow we had to dip into more debt than we planned. Their business is now 100% profitable (some months by a lot) and other than dealing with their variable monthly income (I have a set salary) we won't be experiencing that again. \n\nHowever, the debt is still there. We aren't living above our means and aren't using the credit cards anymore. We follow a strict budget (ynab) and are actually able to pay $1,500 + 2,500 more than the minimum payment on one of the cards we are focusing on. But we feel like we can get this debt down faster and the high interest rate + high balances are doing no favors. \n\nOur income is also high at $180,00+; we don't have a crazy high mortgage ($2,000) and have very low car payments compared to what they could be at $250 per vehicle (we made very large down payments). \n\nThis debt is preventing us from doing things we would love to do (more travel, home remodel, etc.) we have thought about a few things to potentially do.\n\n**- Option 1:** Debt Consolidation Personal Loan - we would be able to save about 11-13% in interest going with this route and pay the debt down faster. \n\n**- Option 2:** Inherited IRA withdrawal. We have an inherited IRA (spouses uncle) that has $160,000. This was before the Secure Act so we can keep this around for a long time taking small required RMAs every year (stretch ira). We also have a 401K and IRA accounts so this Inherited account isn't our only retirement savings. We would have to pay about 16% in taxes to withdraw (federal + state). \n\n**- Option 3:** Keep trucking along with paying $1,500+$2,500 more than the minimum payment on one card then move on to the next.",

Even if you can't get $50k, you could get whatever amount and shift a like amount from the cards and then rinse and repeat, if necessary.\n\nBut before you plan any traveling or remodeling, you need to save for those plans and be able to pay them in full instead of relying on putting them on credit cards and paying off over time.",

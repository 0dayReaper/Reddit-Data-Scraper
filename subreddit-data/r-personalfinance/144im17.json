I like to do things by the books, so I am less inclined to write off questionable expenses. If I am paying 7%interest and let\u2019s say that\u2019s 5k a year, can I write all that off from revenue or is it a percentage?",

Let\u2019s say you are in the 22% tax bracket after all deductions and whatnot, a $5k deduction (if still in 22%) is $1100 saved, so the interest only costed you $3900 at the end of the year.",

With a rental you get to deduct expenses against income in the schedule E, you don\u2019t get to deduct it against your personal income. Effectively, with enough expenses, you\u2019re income on the property is tax free, BUT you\u2019re still spending post tax dollars to maintain it and with expenses. If you want a unit for tax purposes, don\u2019t buy it, it will cost you more then you\u2019ll ever save with taxes.",

Paying $5000 in interest and deducting that from your income is objectively worse than paying $2000 in interest and deducting that from your income.\n\nBut yes, you can deduct the entirety of the interest you pay on rental properties that you own, this is done on Line 12 of Schedule E.

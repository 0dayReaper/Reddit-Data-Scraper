    "postText": "I need help. **I've been trying to close a bank account for 4 years.** \n\nI've been with the bank for over 20 years, but then a series of horrible things happened. I was fed up, so I moved my money out and asked to close it.\n\nThey told me I couldn't close it unless I went in person. Unfortunately, I moved to a state where the nearest bank is 5 hours away. I'm not driving 5 hours to close the bank account.\n\nThey acknowledged this fact but refused to assist me any further. So every few months I move money in and out of the account to keep it \"active.\" **Now they are charging me a \"dormant account\" fee every month even though I deposit money in and out of it.**\n\nI really just want to close it once and for all. It's such a headache. **Is there any way I can force this?**\n\nIs there anything I can do to get rid of this horrible bank that's trying to slowly rob me of my money?",

Or looking up the specific branch manager and making contact with them directly?\n\nYou don't have to actually converse with the manager, you're just looking to get to someone who knows the actual bank's policies and how to go about closing an account for someone who has moved far away with no realistic way of visiting the branch in person.\n\nIf that got me nowhere, then I'd file a CFPB complaint.  Not to expect the CFPB to do anything, but again, just to get the attention of someone higher up who can actually help me with the situation.",

This is typically a long PDF document outlining all of the terms and conditions of their accounts. Look specifically for what it says about how to close the account. If it says you can close it by sending a letter, then do that, and reference the specific section of the Deposit Agreement in your letter. If it says you can only close it by visiting a branch in person, then you may not have any other options.\n\nI have used many banks over the years (well over a dozen) and have never needed to go in person to close an account. I've always been able to do it either by writing a letter or sending a secure message through online banking. I always make sure to transfer out any remaining balance first, so I'm just asking them to close a zero-balance account. That might make it easier than if they had to mail a check.",

So I finally got an appointment at a branch and explained they reopened my account and switched statements. She argued that I reopened it and switched. She then said I always had paper statements. I said if that is the case then why did I only started getting charged after it was reopened. I told her to keep the 10 cents and waive the fees and close it out. She finally agreed.",

You've been giving this mental space for 4 years - just rip the band-aid off.\n\nAgain, I don't agree with what your bank is doing but if the only way out is to go and close it then just go and close it.",

Although likely they will continue to charge the fee, and  make the account balance negative,  then close it as a negative balance, and then send you collection letters. \n\nWhat happens next could vary. They may or may not report the negative balance in your credit report, you may get black listed from opening a new account with them, a \"negative mark\" may follow you when opening other banking accounts with other banks as some use a reporting system on customers that as I am aware of is not visible to us(unlike credit report).",

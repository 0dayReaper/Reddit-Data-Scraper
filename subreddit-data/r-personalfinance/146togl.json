Can the funds be transferred to a different investment account, or should I just take the funds out?\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

You *must* remove the overcontributions.  *Do not remove the gains.*  Only remove the *contributions*.\n\n\n\n2021\n\n* File Form 5329 for 2021.  Pay penalty 6% * Overcontribution (ie 6%*$2415 = $144.90)\n\n2022\n\n* File Form 5329 for 2022.  Pay penalty 6% * Overcontribution (ie 6%*$2415 = $144.90)\n\n2023:\n\n* Remove the amount of the total overcontributions (ie $2415).  This will stop the penalty from continuing.\n* File Form 5329 for 2023.  Report end of penalty.\n\nThere will also be penalties/interest.  You can calculate those yourself or you can wait for the IRS to send a bill for them.  Once you get the bill, you can ask to have the penalty waived.  Generally, interest is not waivable.\n\n\n--\n\n\n**What to do for to 2022/2023 contributions**\n\nPerform the Backdoor Roth strategy.  This approach assumes you have NO pre-existing Traditional/Rollover/SEP/SIMPLE IRAs.\n\n2022\n\n* Contact your IRA Custodian for a RECHARACTERIZATION of 2022's contribution ($5520).  This will make your Roth IRA contributions into Traditional IRA contributions.  You have until 10/15/2023 to complete this step.\n* File Form 8606 for 2022.  Print it off of the IRS website.  Fill it out.  Print.  Mail.  There is no need to file an amendment for 2022 (assuming you already submitted your tax return).  See the LATE CONTRIBUTIONS section in the first link below.\n\n2023\n\n* Contact your IRA Custodian for a RECHARACTERIZATION of 2023's contribution ($2415).  This will make your Roth IRA contributions into Traditional IRA contributions.\n* Convert the *entire* Traditional IRA to Roth IRA.\n* You File Form 8606 for 2023.  Again reference the first link below for guidance. \n\n--\n\n\nRead this for everything you need to know about Backdoor Roth and Form 8606:\n\n* https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/backdoor-roth-ira-tutorial/\n\nRead this list of common screwups and solutions with respect to backdoor Roth.

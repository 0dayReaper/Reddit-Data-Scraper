    "postText": "I personally have used Quicken for close to 15 years now (&amp; have been using Quickbooks at my job for the last 8 years). In the last year, at his request, I\u2019ve been assisting my younger brother with his finances but he refuses to learn how to use Quicken - he claims it\u2019s too complicated.\n\nI also got married last year &amp; was handed over my husband\u2019s finances at the start of the year. I don\u2019t think my husband will use Quicken so I\u2019m trying to figure something else out that could work for both of us or at least have some sort of folder with all the information laid out so he can take over the finances at any given moment without issue. Also finances stresses him out so with all the accounts we have combined, I don\u2019t think Quicken will work well for him. \n\nI don\u2019t understand HOW anyone manages their stuff WITHOUT Quicken. Anytime I ask someone how they keep up with their stuff they can\u2019t give me a detail answer. Basically it sounds like a lot of them are winging it. \n\nTrying to teach my younger brother makes me think about the future for when we have kids. Am I going to be able to figure out alternative ways to help them be successful financially?\n\nI\u2019m looking for some insight here.",

Before my involvement, he\u2019s had his electric turned off &amp; almost had his car repoed (didn\u2019t pay the payment for almost 3 months). He has also borrowed thousands of dollars from mom that needs to be paid back (approx $15k). \n\nSince my involvement, I\u2019ve gotten him a secured card to put all his utilities on paying it off on the due date, savings was getting built up, &amp; his score has gone from 480 to 635. Also his borrowing money from mom has been nonexistent. \n\nHe was doing really good until the last 2 months when he decided to quit his 9-5/M-F job to do art for music festivals (makes pretty decent money - it\u2019s just not consistent enough to pay all his stuff, especially since he\u2019s spending more).\n\nI would feel more comfortable handing his stuff back to him organized in a way he can figure it out so he doesn\u2019t have to get with me afterwards - basically a \u201cclean break\u201d would be nice. I have a Quicken file just for him but he tells me it doesn\u2019t work for him but can\u2019t tell me how he plans on doing it. \n\nThis situation is A LOT with him and I can keep going but my main goal for him is to give his stuff back to him where he can be successful and not have to borrow more money from our mom. Hence looking for solutions for someone that\u2019s smart enough to make money with art but doesn\u2019t apply himself when doing things he doesn\u2019t like doing (ya know. The adult stuff no one likes doing).",

He definitely lives outside his means and has a horrible understanding of how credit cards work and how they should be utilized. I switched him from a debit card to 3 credit cards (daily, gas only, emergency only) and he would max out the daily and then swipe whatever card. He doesn\u2019t plan for the events he \u201chas to go\u201d in order to sell his products and has had back to back busted weekends (ROI wasn\u2019t there, definitely spent more going than what he brought back). Credit cards wasn\u2019t a great idea, but it allowed for a better cash flow so his bills could get paid. But now with the decrease in income and increase in expense, I thought it would be best to let him max out the cards &amp; just make sure the mins are paid &amp; nothing is over limit since there\u2019s not much I can do. When he no longer has credit lines to use and doesn\u2019t have the funds to pay his rent, that will be him falling on his face but I feel like he\u2019s gonna end up blaming me so this since Im the one \u201chandling his money\u201d. I\u2019m trying to head this off by giving it all back to him but I would have to do it in a way where he can\u2019t come back blaming me that I handed him a mess. \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Im thinking some sort of binder with a tab for each account &amp; a sheet at the front with all his accounts listed out with their due dates and then all the utilities with their due dates. And then a cover page for each account with the information as far as 800#, credit line/APR %, statement drop date and login information. \n\nOR a monthly spreadsheet that he can fill in with the information for each account and each bill he has that can be filled out from the paper statements. With a paid column where he can write the date it was paid.&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nIn hindsight, I think a prepaid debit card would have been a better route.",

Just pay off his bills first, rent,   take maybe 20% for savings, transfer food money weekly to a debit card, and rest as lump sum (or what ever you feels is best).

How many hours he could work and squeak by.\n\nFrom there, we started looking at spreadsheets and how to create them to suit his needs.\n\nHope this helps. Cheers!",

We both contribute to retirement accounts/HSAs/pensions at levels we're comfortable with, and then our leftover income is direct deposited into a HYSA. About a week before the first of the month we move enough over to checking to cover the mortgage (~20% of net earnings after tax/retirement) and whatever else we've accrued on our CCs over the month, which is all then set up to be auto paid on the first. \n\nIf the HYSA gets above about $50k we make some additional investments into brokerage accounts. We also won't let the HYSA go below about $30k, and the balance between these limits serves as a rough barometer of any lifestyle creep. Maybe this only works if your income+saving rate is comfortably higher than your desired spending. For us it works and any additional optimization is not worth the effort.",

I have maybe a dozen or so cards, but don\u2019t use them for the spending categories as much as I use the best ones for cash rewards. \n\nRight now my brother has subprime cards and if that\u2019s on his credit, he\u2019ll have a hard time getting prime/super-prime cards especially with his credit not above 660 (I was so close \ud83d\ude29 but he kept charging the wrong card right at statement drop date AND wouldn\u2019t transfer money from his cash apps in time to get that stuff paid off to report properly - also was trying to get his credit high enough for a small loan to pay off a charge off to help boost his credit).",

I love their categorizing and all that. It\u2019s super helpful for me to keep up with how my spending habits are. It\u2019s pretty good at knowing my Amazon Whole Foods order is groceries and not merchandise. There are other purchases I thought it would categorize wrong, but it is pretty accurate.\n\nBut I feel like keeping all purchases on a single credit card really helps keep an eye on what\u2019s going on. I do have other credit cards, but they are used for either personal luxuries or travel related stuff like flights. My husband and I save 10% of our own money towards a personal savings account. Then we have different percentages allocated to different savings account like travel and emergency. My personal money is for any purchases I make for myself that aren\u2019t like normal needs. Like shampoo, underwear, tents or things we would both use go on our joint card (where groceries and stuff go). Then things like buying myself an iPad or a new fancy set of boots come from my personal account. So I use my personal credit card for that purchase but pay it off in full each month. So I never spend more than I have.",

    "postText": "My first ever accident and I don\u2019t know what to do. Please I hope this is the right place. Pretty much my tire popped on the freeway and I spun out into an embankment. No injuries. No other vehicles involved. The damage: busted gas tank, busted tires and possibly some body damage I\u2019ll find out tomorrow. \n\nMy questions are: is it advantageous for me to report this to my insurance? Is there a time frame by which I should report? Is it okay to have a mechanic give me a quote before reporting this all to insurance so I can decide based on the cost? Is there any advantage to paying out of pocket for repairs? Any and all input is very helpful",

            "comment": "Just my personal input, you should report if you cannot pay for the repairs out of pocket. If you can and it doesn\u2019t hurt you to bad financially, I\u2019d almost always recommend paying out of pocket unless if like 10k worth of damages. If you do put a claim in, it\u2019ll go on your record and you\u2019ll be paying more for insurance for 7 years I believe. (might be more or less).",

No collision on your policy = no coverage for this accident. Also sounds like you could be possibly looking at close to a total loss situation.",

You might end up paying higher premiums, that outweigh the cost of repairs.  Maybe your insurance has accident forgiveness.   Maybe they'll pay for a car rental while yours is being repaired.   It all depends.",

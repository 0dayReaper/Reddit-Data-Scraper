    "postText": "I recently decided I wanted to move on from my job for a variety of reasons. One of the main reasons was I felt I was undervalued. So with a lot of research here is how I went from $58,000 to $85,000.\n\n1. I felt I was undervalued, so I needed to prove it. \n2. I needed another job, obviously.\n3. I needed to know how to negotiate.\n4. I needed to make sure I knew my bottom line and what I really wanted.\n5. Making the decision.\n\nSo lets start with number 1. **Am I undervalued?**\n\nI needed to research how much my job title was worth. For this I went to the bureau of labor statistics, salary.com, glassdoor.com, and google.  http://www.bls.gov/ooh/ has nearly ever piece of info you need to decide what your position is worth.  Salary.com and glassdoor.com also where close to bls.  Don't settle on one source for anything. \n\nDo realize when doing this part that you need to take into consideration the local job market in your area.  Where I live for example, I know my area pays less than the median because my cost of living is alot lower than most other places.  So when you decide what the median pay is for what you do, be realistic. For me the median pay was $70,000.  My current job was paying me $58,000.  So number one was finished, I am being undervalued.\n\nOn to number 2. **Find another job**\n\nI needed to find other places of employment in my area, doing what I wanted to do.  For this I went to the google, as it has all the answers.  I made profiles on careerbuilder, indeed, glassdoor, and monster.  I updated my resume, and started applying for everything I thought I would want to do.  \n\nIt is important to realize when applying for jobs it is time consuming and will get frustrating repeating your self over and over.  But you need to stay diligent. Also it is worth your time to tweak your resume to match key words in the application you are applying for.  \n\nI wish I would have known the importance of networking as well.  Sometimes the best opportunities are ones you get by someone mentioning your name to the right person.  Never burn bridges and always reach out to those who may be able to vouch for you.\n\nAnyway, I applied for a week straight. Then slowly the calls and emails started rolling in. Hell yes!\n\nBy the end of the week I had 3 interviews setup. I was amazed on just how easy it could be to get the process started.  Then the hard part came. Interviewing.\n\nMy interviews went awesome.  I researched what to say and how to say it, how to accent my strengths, and all that jazz. The best piece of advice on how to interview well is read! Google is your best friend.  For me the best things were my drive to succeed and my willingness to learn.  Many employers will pick people who are driven over people with alot of experience.  Obviously you need to have some skills, but don't underestimate the power of persistence.\n\nEmployer A gave me a range for the job pretty easily when i asked about it.  This makes your negotiating power much higher as most of you know. But the range was way to low.  I knew already this place was out.  But I thanked them for the interview anyway. Sometimes you just are to far apart to waste each others time any further.  Be polite though if this happens and move on.\n\nEmployer B wanted to know how much I wanted for a salary.  I thought \"Oh yea I know not to say anything, I am so clever!\"  Well they didn't budge.  The wouldn't give me a range, and they kept at me.  Sometimes this will happen.  Handle it accordingly.  I gave them a high range 75k-85k.  They seemed ok with it.\n\nEmployer C was the same way as Employer B. I handled it the same.\n\nNumber 3. **Negotiation**\n\nSo I received 3 offers in 2 weeks.  Wait, you got offers at all 3 places? Hell yes I did! One offer was lower than I wanted, so employer A was out. Be sure to thank everyone for there time and offers.  Remember... Don't burn bridges.\n\nBut the other 2 offers where above the median income I researched!  This further made me realize I'm definitely worth more than I'm making now. Employer B was at $82,000. Employer C was at $75,000.  It was almost surreal for me to hear these numbers.  This validated my thoughts and research of being undervalued even further.\n\nThere is a myriad of things to negotiate. Don't just think about salary, but the overall package. This article helped me alot when preparing.  http://www.careerempowering.com/interview-power/negotiating-the-best-salary.html  Don't be afraid to tell people what you want.  But don't go overboard.  No one is going to pay you 1,000,000 a year to clean toilets.\n\nNow that I have these offers I can leverage one against the other.  This works the best when you know a company really wants you. I spoke with both companies back and forth and I knew employer B was the winner. Damn this is crazy! 58k to 82k in 2 weeks. \n\nI go to my current boss and tell him whats happening.  I was upfront and honest about everything, that's usually the best way to go. Then my current employer decides to counter offer. $85,000.  What the hell do I do now? My brain is on overload.\n\nThrough much reading and researching I found that counter offers are generally a bad idea to accept.  I mean I wanted to leave anyway, that hasn't changed.  So I took the counter offer and spoke with the other employer B about it.  They decide to match the salary and I negotiate more days off.  Is this really happening? 85k\n\nNumber 4. **Knowing what you really want, and what you bottom line is**\n\nThe offer of $85,000 was above and beyond my bottom line.  The overall package of benefits matched my expectations.  The job is what I wanted to do.  You need to know this stuff going in and be able to walk away when someone does meet your bottom line. Staying strong and not budging on this bottom line is essential.  \n\nFinally 5. **Making the decision**\n\nThe hardest part of all this stuff is making an actual decision. I'm going from $58,000 to $85,000 in either decision I make. I'm on the winning side either way.  Try and take your emotions out of it, and look at the facts.  For me I decided to take the new opportunity and take the plunge into the unknown.  Do not second guess yourself. \n\nI realize my situation may not be average.  Getting a 45% raise probably isn't typical. But the fact remains that it is possible to negotiate a better lifestyle. It is nerve racking, intense, anxiety inducing, and difficult.  But it is all worth it in the end. I hope this helps at least one person in their pursuit of a better life.  Thanks pf for all the help and courage to tackle the unknown.",

You didn't just go to your employer with \"pay me more.\"  You got 85K because you looked outside.  No way you would get that otherwise.\n\n2.  You named your own range.  That's a good thing.  Usually the side who first names a price ends up determining the outcome.\n\n3.  You didn't accept the new job before discussing with your employer, and you didn't accept the counteroffer, but used it to your benefit.\n\nNicely done on all accounts.\n\n10/10 would read again.  ",

Usually the side who first names a price ends up determining the outcome.\n\n\nThis is called \"anchoring\" in negotiations. The idea that the 1st person to name a price loses is a myth. Usually, the 1st person to name a price sets the stake in the ground on the price range. So it's to your advantage to name your price range first.\n\nThe big caveat is that you have to do the homework to know what's the reasonable range. Say it's 70k to 80k. Then you want to anchor a little bit outside of the high end of the range, maybe 10% to 15% more - 88k to 92k. Usually you'll end up with something around 85k.\n\n",

That is the prevailing mindset because a lot of negotiation revolves around situations where you *must* strike a deal.  A salary negotiation is not one of those cases, either side is free to walk away at any time if they believe that they cannot make a reasonable deal.\n\n&gt; If the applicant 'anchors' themselves too high, the employer simply says you're out of their range.\n\nWhile that could happen, I've never seen it happen to myself, friends, or family.  Usually if you come in high and it's out of their range you can get clarification from them on the salary range, especially if your phrase it as \"depending on what the total compensation package looks like\".  Most employers aren't going to blow off a candidate that they really want just because they asked for $2000 more than they were thinking of paying.  I guess it might happen if you're well above their salary range, but if the candidate has done their homework (instead of just pulling numbers out of their ass at random) then they should have a pretty good idea of how much the position *should* pay.  If the employer isn't willing to pay the going rate then you don't want to work for them anyway.  Again, being in a negotiation that you can walk away from gives you that power.\n\n&gt;  If they anchor below what the employers range is then the employer will take that opportunity to get you for cheaper.\n\nThat should never happen.  As a job candidate you should be researching what the going rate is for positions of that type, in that industry, in that geographic area.  You should already have a fairly accurate idea of what the salary range for the position *should* be before you've even sent them your resume.  Then you do what /u/Astyrrian said and anchor a bit above that range.  That should give you the wiggle room to prevent your from undercutting yourself.  As he said, you **have** to do your homework and figure out what is a reasonable range before staking your offer.",

The new companies saw you as an engineer. Only when you had a the outside offers did the old company realize you should/could get paid at a higher engineering rate. The other option is that they just pay engineers less, but that seems unlikely since they were willing to match with a counter offer.\n\nDid you happen to switch industries too? I've noticed automation/electrical engineer salaries can vary significantly between industries.  ",

I see way to many of my own coworkers proud of their 20 year career..but i make 20ish k more than they do.  Its not the 60/70/80's anymore. Most companies don't give to shits about how long you toiled away for them.\n\nTake your skills to a new workplace you should always move up the pay scale at least in my experience.  I usually give employers 5 years based on my own value. If I haven't moved, then I start to look for the next position.\n\nI don't make a ton, but in the last decade,I've gone from 28 - 37 - 51 - 77, all with a growing skill base.  All this has been done in the banking world. I'm in year 4 at the current job so my resume has been updated, and the few I have my eye on I know I can get and will excel in are near 100k or so\n\nDon't be passive or afraid of moving on",

We're taking on newer responsibilities and are starting to get forced to cover for each other for vacations and things because the department isn't growing. It's exhausting and I may have to \"explore my options\" in the near future here, but I don't have the energy at the end of my 12 hour shifts or my days off.",

I just turned 30.. probably have 1-2 years at my job until I look for something better.\n\nBesides the money making factor.. any job in IT (or networking, which is what I do), gets a bit complacent after time.. fixing the same kind of issues, solving the same sort of problems..

I was there just over 6 months, finished my Bachelors degree, and realized I hated that lifestyle. I applied to a few places I considered dream jobs. I got interviews at both, and took a new position with a large company doing less work, and making mid 70's with a bigger benefit package.

The old marketing manager didn't really value me, so I decided to update my CV and started job searching.\n\nNew marketing manager came on board and caught wind that I was applying for jobs from the person I report to.  Had done a second interview with a competitor company.  So he had a chat with me and I was as honest as I could be - told him I was getting neither good pay nor gaining more experience.  He asked me what the competitor is willing to pay for the job I interviewed for - answered 55-60k.  He told me to give him time to reshuffle the product categories and to tell him if my circumstances change.  A month later got the promotion letter which came with the 60k salary.",

Does anybody have any negative experience as far as that's concerned?\n\nAbout 6 months ago I went through a similar(ish) experience as OP. Difference being that I was recruited by another firm instead of actively looking for it. They were part of a team which had recently won a major infrastructure project (we were unfortunately on the losing team) and they were in the process of hiring staff to perform the work. I really liked my current work place and it had a lot of positives over the new firm, but they'd offered a big raise to join them and get a chance to work on this major job that we'd spent the last 8 months chasing.\n\nI ended up staying at my current firm after I'd notified my boss that I'd received an offer and they'd decided to give me raise/promotion. I think it ended up working for the best (that firm ended up getting massively de-scoped on the project), but definitely get some barbs about heading to/from a job interview if I'm a bit better dressed than normal on a given day. It's mostly just in jest though. \n\nHas anybody had some really bad experiences accepting a counter-offer from their current work-place?   ",

In a panic the current employer may want to keep you and give a counter right away.  This may go badly in the future for advancement and promotions.  Also they may just try and keep you until they can train a replacement .\n\nIt isn't always the case. Sometimes things work out for some.  It's really something each person has to decide what's right for them and how much they trust the people they work for.",

I know plenty of people who got big raises this way and continued to work at the same firm happily for several years after that.   ",

If they see it as \"This employee is clearly underpaid and we value them, so we should do what it takes to retain them.\" then you should consider it.  \n\nAlternatively, if the response is \"Policy is only 4% max per year\" or \"We don't negotiate like that\" or \"You should have negotiated a better salary when you started\" then just move on.  You will encounter the second scenario far more often.  \"The company just doesn't allow people to do that\" will be the basis of the response.  If this company gives you the raise after you fight for it or find another offer, you will have a target on you and you will be first to go if they get a reason to.  \n\nThe compromise that I have been in more often, in IT, is \"We can't pay that range for this position\" which then means they have to shoehorn you into another position that you may or may not be suited for.  If you are up for it, it makes for interesting new experiences.  It's a good way to get even more on you resume to jump from later, or you may find that you really like the new position.  The company wins because they are getting more for their money.  ",

However most companies don't trust management to do this without doing anything at all that might be construed as discriminatory or otherwise illegal. Everyone has a lawyer these days, and is looking for a reason to sue. \n\nAlso, in order to successfully fight an unemployment claim, you need to prove that an employee was terminated for cause, which usually means proving that the employee was aware that their actions could lead to termination, and still did whatever they did regardless. In order to prove this, you generally need a lot of documentation showing that you thoroughly informed your employee that their actions were unacceptable and would lead to termination. \n\nSo for example if you have an employee that is consistently late for work, you wouldn't just fire them on the spot. The first step would be a conversation with the employee. Then the second step would be a written warning with an improvement plan outlining what needs to be done going forward. Then the last step would be a final written warning telling the employee that if they do this again they're getting fired. \n\nIf you just walk someone out the door, you would be almost guaranteed to lose at an unemployment hearing due to the lack of just cause.",

But end of the day he needed to provide so started applying around. He was making in the range of 40-45K and got an offer immediately for $70K. He went to his current bosses to let them know he got an offer. They decided to match the offer and guaranteed in writing $85K within the next 2 years. \n\nIf you aren't looking every couple years you don't really know if you are getting a competitive salary. He had asked for a raise and kept getting the \"lets wait\" answer. As soon as he got an offer elsewhere they jumped on it and wanted to keep him around. Another reason he stayed is he has been moving up quicker than anybody else there and sees a future with the company. That's something else that's important, taking a job elsewhere that can be a dead end isn't always the best either even if it has a higher salary right now.",

I had concerns about being the only source of income for my family of five, so risk averse. As time went on, even though raises were earned and responsiblity gained, I had a nagging sense that I was undervalued and underappreciated in this family business. A few years ago, my concern about the rest of my career led me to think I would be better off somewhere else, so I set a January 1 date to begin a search. Prior to that date, though, I was approached by two employers, and started imagining different possibilities.\n\nAs I did, I found that, even though I'd had a good career, there were better choices available to me. I established what it would take for me to switch, considering the quality of the employer, the job description, and the income. I set a goal to achieve a 25% pay increase, with a more focused job description.\n\nI decided I would not attempt to leverage my current employer, instead opting for a take it or leave it response from one of the two prospective employers. I got a fair offer from the one I valued most, but below my goal, so I countered. They matched the number I set as the low end of my salary goal, adding a provision for bonuses set at 25% of salary. On acceptance, I resigned my position and let the current employer know that I would not consider a counter-offer. Unfortunately for them, the time to recognize value was gone. In two years, I achieved through promotion and bonuses a 60% income bump. More importantly, my work is valued higher, I enjoy my coworkers, and I am with a better company.",

Now a couple points for future readers:\n\n&gt; I realize my situation may not be average. Getting a 45% raise probably isn't typical.\n\nThis is true.  In order to get a 45% raise you have to be pretty seriously undercompensated to begin with.  If you're staying on top of your career then this *shouldn't* happen, but lots of people do wake up one day and say \"I'm worth more than this\".\n\n&gt; I wish I would have known the importance of networking as well. Sometimes the best opportunities are ones you get by someone mentioning your name to the right person. Never burn bridges and always reach out to those who may be able to vouch for you.\n\nI feel like this was almost a throw-away comment, but I wanted to re-emphasize its importance.  A lot of Redditors look down on networking as schmoozing, ass-kissing, or other BS.  It's not.  It's about building a network of professional contacts that *you* can help and that can help you.  I've changed jobs 4 times in the last 16 years, and every single time it's been to a job that I got through networking rather than applying on a web site.  Every case was a situation where I was working and relatively happy in another job, but an even better opportunity came up through my network and I took advantage of it.  In two of those cases I had first crack at the job and accepted before the positions were even posted.  That is clearly a **massive** advantage in a job search.\n\n&gt;  I gave them a high range 75k-85k. They seemed ok with it...\n&gt;  Employer B was at $82,000. Employer C was at $75,000. It was almost surreal for me to hear these numbers. \n\nSo this is a valuable less that people should consider making when negotiating salary.  You were looking for at least $70k.  If forced to give a desired salary range, many people with a $70k target would give a range of $65k-$75k.  That is called a \"bracketing range\", because the upper and lower bounds bracket the desired target.  What they really should be doing is give a \"bolstering range\", i.e., suggesting a range of $70k-$80k.  This sets the floor for your salary negotiations to be your actual target, so it increases the likelihood that you can negotiate a higher salary than your target (assuming that the budget for the position permits it).\n\nAlways give a salary range, by the way.  I had one recruiter who insisted on playing the \"how much do you make today\" game.  I told him that my target salary range would be $125k-$135k, and he said \"So $125k?\"  I had to clarify to him that I'm looking for a total compensation package, and that the acceptable salary would be in the $125k-$135k range, but actually was dependent on the value of other benefits that the company offered.  That's actually a very reasonable way to justify not tying yourself down to a single value for salary.\n\nWhich comes to...\n\n&gt;  The overall package of benefits matched my expectations. \n\nWhen it comes to negotiation, many people completely forget about the non-salary parts of their compensation.  That's a huge mistake.  If you spend all of your time focusing on straight salary and forget about other benefits, you may find yourself accepting a position that pays nominally more in salary but which has an overall lower compensation package.  Don't forget to take into account vacation time, retirement plan contributions, employee stock purchase plans, bonus, and training budget when you are evaluating multiple job offers.",

People looked at the lifestyle that lawyers were able to afford and decided that they too wanted a boat and Porsche. Problem is, law school is unreal levels of expensive in the low end, and nigh impossible to get at the high end. There is lots and lots of competition, since law school's now pump out people who are able to pass the bar and work for next to nothing since they have no experience and there are loads of them. Unless you went to Harvard, Yale, or some other place with name recognition, you simply cannot make the boatloads of money that the schools tell you. \n\nI think that I would have enjoyed becoming a lawyer, but by and large the sheer amount of competition versus job openings combined with expense and how hard it is to get into a good school made me say no.

If they thought you were worth 85k they likely would have been paying you 85k. I have seen a number of people stay until the company could find a replacement for them often at a lower cost and they dump you. I worked as a consultant for over a decade and I saw this happen across industries, locations, even pay scales. \n\nVery rarely is a company willing to give you that kind of raise due to ultimatum and still view you as a \"team player\" \"who is with us for the long haul\". You already shopped them once, there is nothing stopping you from doing it again and likely when they will need you the most. By shopping your job you have likely tainted the well so to speak.\n\nTo put it another way. You had to find another job and threaten to QUIT before they were able to give you proper remuneration. Why would you say with a company that would treat you like that? Had they valued you, they would have paid you like they did. ",

You are the person responsible for owning it and this is a fantastic example of how you should do it. \n\nI'm also a strong believer in not accepting counter offers to stay. Not only have you emotionally distanced yourself from your old job and opened yourself up to the possibility of a new job but staying only for the money is a mercenary act that you management will always remember. Getting a different role is a different thing but there will always be an undercurrent of \"I had to go elsewhere to get you to realise what I'm worth\" and that dysfunction will always be there.\n\nOne quick question: did you have regular 1 to 1's or meetings with your boss where you told him about your \"variety of reasons\" to move on?",

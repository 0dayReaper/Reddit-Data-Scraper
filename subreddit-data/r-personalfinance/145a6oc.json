By June 2024 I could have $30k cash saved which isn\u2019t enough to buy house then.\n\nIf I instead save right now with minimal credit card payments I can have $20k for a house downpayment + using a downpayment assistance program in my area puts my total at about $50k cash.  When you sell or refinance, you have to cover the assisted amount (up to 35k). By June 2024 I\u2019d have a house, be cc debt free, and have a few thousand (5k) in cash, but will continue saving.\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards buying a house &amp; taking advantage of the program while funds are available.  My current rent is about $3000 with utilities included, and 9/30 renewal will probably increase.\n\nShould I not try buying a house?\n\nEdit:  Thank you everyone for your thoughts, appreciate it.",

Yes, they are getting more expensive, but you are getting poorer faster.\n\nOn top of that, the maximum amount you will be allowed to borrow and the interest rate you will receive on the mortgage will depend in part on the ratio of your debt to income. Carrying that large debt will dramatically limit what you can buy and substantially increase your cost.",

It\u2019s not just the mortgage payment but maintenance and upkeep costs &amp; potentially HOAs. Owning a home is an expensive indulgence.  I have plenty of friends with much higher net worths than me because they delayed buying a home until they were really financially ready and they were able to throw money into retirement and a general brokerage account while renting and saving longer while all my money was going to fix and upgrade things a landlord would have taken care of.  The equity in home ownership is just a way to take on more debt until you actually sell the home and any gains in value in the short term is generally eaten away in the cost of up keep on the house.  Pay off debt and save money. If you need the down payment assistance to buy the house you can\u2019t afford the house.   \n\nIf you buy a house while having 19K in credit card debt and no emergency fund, you could very quickly have 40K in credit card debt. When an appliance breaks or you need a new roof or have to fix a leak and you have no cash you\u2019ll have to put in on the credit card or apply for financing from a store. This is how people end up house poor and also have credit card debt.  With no CC debt you\u2019ll likely qualify for a better interest rate also saving you thousands in the long run.",

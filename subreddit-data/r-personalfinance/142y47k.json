    "postText": "Last August (2022) I received a random Zelle payment from a former roommate of $3,500. Right after receiving the $3,500 from him, he called me asking if I got it, explaining that he didn't initiate the transaction and I should return the money to him.\n\nI took pause and offered to take the money out in cash and return it to him, or use another service like Venmo or Paypal to give it back, but he insisted on using Zelle. I have that part of the conversation in text messages, as that I was at work and had to migrate our conversation to texting. Even though this felt like a scam, I returned it via Zelle. Surprise surprise, it never showed up in his account.\n\nHe spent months hounding Wells Fargo to get these funds back, and to prove that it was a scam, which he eventually did and got his money back. This is where things get bad for me...\n\nIn October (2022), on my birthday no less, I woke up to learn that my checking account had gone from $900 to $0.00, and the only bit of information on my bank statement next to this transaction was \"Zelle Fraud\". I immediately got on the phone with Chase, my bank, and submitted a claim, explaining to their fraud department what had happened.\n\nI assume that by admitting it was fraud, Wells Fargo needed to recoup the $3,500 they refunded my former roommate, and turned around to Chase and took it out of my account, which Chase obliged to because they did not yet have the proper information as to what happened and my account was the closest thing attatched to the incident.\n\nIn fear of draining my account again if I deposited any sum of money, it remained at $0.00 as I waged war with Chase's fraud department. Two months later my Chase account was closed from inactivity. I was lucky enough to get a higher-up customer service representative on the phone, and she was able to get into my closed account to send me my bank statement from 7/22 - 10/22, so I at least have a record of the few sketchy transactions.\n\nTo this day, I have not been able to speak with a representative at Chase who actually decides whether a case is fraudulent or not. The buck stops at a \"fraud department representative\" who is only able to re-submit my case, time after time. I have gone into several branches hoping to speak with someone who might be able to elivate this case, only to be sat down again at a desk, making the same phone call to the same department I was calling from home. No one in a Chase branch has been able to connect me to someone helpful to talk to. \n\n I had been a Chase customer for 17 years before this with no prior issues. I am afraid to open up an account with another bank for fear of Wells Fargo coming for my money until they recoup the $3,500. I live off a Venmo debit card, but I just want to get my Chase account back. I have a lot of evidence (screen shots, emails, bank statements, filed fraud case numbers...etc..)\n\nWhat do I do??\n\n**UPDATE 2: (3AM EST)**\n\nI feel pretty pessimistic after reading all of that.\n\nTrust me. If you just got here...... ^((whispering)) *it's bad*. Just scroll down!\n\nAnd guess what, it's allllll my fault. Truly! I really buggered it this time ol' chap.\n\nNot really though, I'm not the only player at fault. (shhh) I just needed a further understanding of what exactly happened. And boiii did I get it.\n\nThe truth still remains uncovered, and the people in here who have acknowledged my end of the tale actually gave sound advice! I now have a roadmap of what to do next, since posting my sob-story earlier tonight. Mind you, it's basically the equivalent of a mapquest printout of directions, but it will hopefully get me somewhere.\n\nNonetheless, this somewhat public spanking of mine readjusted my expectations, to say the least. Yes I'm naive. Yes I fell victim to a highly preventable scam. So sue me!\n\nNo please don't, and I don't want to sue anyone either.\n\nThere's been some really helpful, immediately applicable info that was presented though. I plan to put these new stratgies into motion tomorrow. Thank you to the few that had constructive, helpful advice. Shame on the rest, and I hope your misreable lives get better!\n\nI will update as soon as applicable.\n\n**UPDATE 1: (11PM EST)**\n\nIt is confusing, I agree. Ultimately, I feel that I got pulled into my friend being scammed. The way this specific Zelle fraud went down was:\n\n\\-My friend's bank account was hacked, and the scammer sent me $3,500, in the hopes that I would return the money.\n\n\\-The scammer set up a separate bank account in my friend's name, where this money would go, if returned through Zelle.\n\n\\-I returned it through Zelle, and it disappeared into this fake account. We know it was a fake account because it showed up on my bank statement as a different Chase account, not Wells Fargo account, in his name.\n\n\\-He wanted his $3500 back, so he claimed fraud with Wells Fargo, until they complied and agreed it was fraud, so he was refunded.\n\n\\-Wells Fargo went to Chase to recoup their $3500, and without the right info, Chase blamed me, so they drained my account.\n\n\\-My issue: I cannot get in touch with the decision makers at the Chase fraud department, they stonewall me at every turn, so I have been unable to prove my case. At this point, I'm not sure what my friend could really do for me.",

You then willingly sent a clean $3500 to him. When the initial transaction failed to clear, the bank took it back and it disappeared from your account. Chase can do nothing about it because everything happened willingly. If you want the money back, you need to sue him for it.",

You had the funds from a defrauded account that Chase pulled money from. Even if you are completely innocent you are now considered too big of a risk that something like this could happen again. They got plenty of other customers, they don't need you. \n\nNow your worry about Wells Fargo going after another account isn't a concern. They could only go after the funds connected to the fraud. Now Wells Fargo might not allow you to join, and nothing of value was lost, but you can join other banks/credit unions.\n\nYou might of been flagged on one of data broker/non-credit bureau systems, I think chex is the main one to worry about, so opening a new account might be difficult.",

By that I mean I went into a branch, said \"I am closing my account\", and pulled all my money. BoA didn't close the account, charged me fees, sent it to collections (I had moved to another state) and THEN closed the account.\n\nI was basically locked out of setting up a checking account at a major bank for seven years because of a report on Checks Systems (probably renamed by now) which was like a credit reporting system for checking accounts.\n\nThen I found a credit union. They set me up with a savings account of all things that I could get money in and out of and even write the occasional check. It even had a debit card. Don't give up. The big banks may not trust you, but there may be other options.\n\nI still hate BoA with a deep loathing.",

The other was from your account to the scammer's account, that transaction was authorized by you.  The key factor here is that you knowingly transferred money and your friend didn't, it doesn't matter that you didn't mean to transfer the money to the person who ended up with it, only that you knowingly transferred the money.  Basically the only way to get a zelle transaction reversed is to report fraud due to not being the person who performed the transaction.\n\nNow either your friend is the biggest idiot in the world or they were in on the scam.",

I have his written documentation from Wells Fargo of this being the case.\n\nHere is where it becomes hazy as to what happened, but this theory has been acknowledged by Chase as to what might have happened:\n\nWells Fargo wanted to recoup the $3500, so they turned to Chase, Chase looked at the transactions without contacting me, and took what I had in my account. And now I still can't get in touch with the proper people at Chase to explain what actually happened.\n\nI feel as though Chase credited Wells Fargo the $3500 and there was a communication breakdown, so they took the money from me.",

Therefor anything happening in that account was not the responsibility of the friend. OP however, still had full control over their account. And in essence they got duped into sending money. Which ley people call fraud, but that's not the type of fraud that's protected. OP chose to send money, and money got sent. It's no longer protected by the bank as fraud, since it was done on purpose by the account holder",

You can claim the $3,500 you sent your friend was stolen. Your friend claims fraud on the chase account set up in his name because those funds were real funds. \n\nFile a police report for the theft and then have your friend file one for the identity theft. Then have your friend approach Chase about their $3,500 that was stolen fraudulently from the account set up in their name. Then Chase should be able to settle the $2,600 debt you owe and give the remaining $900 back to you.",

I hear what you're saying and I can neither confirm nor deny he had an elaborate scheme to use me to get money from his bank. At this point I'm looking to clean up my side of the street and get my $900 and bank account back.",

Trying to help out the friend you've now been screwed while your friend has at the very least been made whole again from the original loss. I'm still not sure whether or not your friend was involved, but beyond your friendship I'm not sure how much chase will even case.\nThe thing is you authorized the transaction. Whether or not chase is willing to refund you the 900 will probably just depend on if they want to give a goodwill gesture bc the terms of service for zelle is pretty clear that when sending funds it's on the end user to ensure it's going to the person they intend and if it's going to a registered zelle account they can pull the money in minutes. Zelle/banks would probably have to cough up a whole lot for fraud regarding this if they took responsibility for everyone bc it's real easy for scammers to just get money and never be found. I'd probably go into a branch especially perhaps a mgr or something can get in touch with the right ppl in fraud dept. \nAs far as them reopening your account after all this no matter the outcome may be even less likely than them giving u the 900 back. May be seen as too risky especially considering the money and I'm sure man hours that's already been put into this. If u aren't willing to give it all up id just focus on getting 900 resolved and move on to another bank or credit union. \nWish u best of luck OP.",

They've always capped me at the beginning when sending to a new account for the first time, to no more than $500 per day, for the first 30 days on a new payee, SPECIFICALLY to help people limit how much they can get scammed for.  So it would have taken me a full week to send someone $3500, over the course of 7 transactions.  \n\nHave they gotten rid of that initial daily limit?   I know they seem to have gotten rid of the daily total limit you could send to all parties (was $5000, then went to $10,000, now seems to be gone altogether).  But I haven't set up any new payees for a while.  Or is that specific to the bank, and Chase doesn't offer any protections against Zelle users own mistakes?",

Sounds to me like the friend is the \u201cscammer.\u201d  I will bet he got the original 3500 refunded back and the \n\u201cextra\u201d 3500 from you that was sent to another account!!! You were not part of some 3rd party scam.  You did exactly as he instructed as he knew you would without asking a bunch of questions or getting anyone else involved and therefore he was able pull this scam off without a hitch.  Next time talk to your bank and let the fraud department at your bank advise you on anything related to fraud.  This is their job to help their customers to protect their money.  They work with fraudsters everyday and know all of the ways that people are cheating others out of their hard earned money via the banking system.  Tell your friend that you need to clear your good name and to go with you to both banks to help clear this mess up!!! If he refuses to help then there you go with the answer that you are seeking.  To be safe keep the larger of your money on the Venmo card and reopen a second chance account.  Keep a small amount in that account to see if seizing your account is going to happen.  To do this, the bank would have to sue you.  (Not a bad idea because you can prove this scam was initiated by this so-called friend). They have to prove their case.  If they win they would get a civil judgment and know where you bank and can then freeze your account.  My take is that you were definitely scammed.  You may want to discuss your legal options to recover the funds with an attorney.",

Bc this didn't even play out how it normally would. First someone with a knowingly comprised account wants his friend to send the funds directly back via same method it was stolen. Second OP does this without calling bank at all to them to know a fraudulent zelle deposit was made to his account and he sent funds back.  How does scammer even know when/if friend will make contact with OP to have him send funds straight back to the zelle account that I guess was just changed so the method on there would be on the new fake account created in friends name. Just seems like way too many moving parts that aren't even guaranteed to come into play unless you're either one of the parties involved or both parties aren't acting with any degree of caution or skepticism that most reasonable ppl would have after their account was just compromised and $3500 was randomly sent to your friend.",

The bank's fraud department then goes after where those funds were sent, since they don't belong to that person.  If you'd done nothing, you'd be fine now, they'd just take those funds back and everything would be hunky-dory.\n\nOn the other hand you sent a legitimate transaction to someone who lied to you.  You fell for it.  You weren't hacked.  You sent the money, albeit under false pretenses.  You don't have a claim with the bank because you weren't hacked, you weren't coerced, you were just, to be quite frank, gullible.  That isn't the bank's fault.  Zelle doesn't view this as a \"refund\" or a \"reversal\" or a \"return of funds\" or anything like that.  This was two separate transactions.That's why Zelle transactions warn you strongly not to send money to sources you haven't verified, because the money cannot be retrieved after being sent.  This is a super common scam with Zelle and you were today's victim.\n\nI don't think there is a universe in which Chase agrees to give you your money back, and you still owe Wells Fargo's fraud department another $2600, so getting another account may be difficult.  I don't know the advice to give you about this, but I wish you luck.\n\nAlso, this must not have been a very close friend if you didn't recognize their voice when they called you.  I would strongly question anyone sending me $3500 \"accidentally\", but even more so if it wasn't a very close friend or family.\n\n&gt;To be clear, as I recall the phone conversation, it was not insistence but me double checking with him that HE was willing to take the risk. At no point in that 30 minute interaction last summer did I think I would be penalized by Chase.\n\nJust saw this comment you made in another reply.  If that's the case, then it really was your friend who called, and your friend already told you he was willing to take the risk.  What does he have to say about all this?

No auto bill pay, zelle, paypal, nothing except for me myself logging in and only on my own computers.

Reading comprehension is really this hard for some?\n\nOP sent back the $3500 he received to a fake account.\n\nWells Fargo apparently agreed there was fraud in the form of a hacked account and came looking to the OP's Chase account to recoup their loses from the hack they allowed somehow.\n\nOP is talking about Wells Fargo trying to recoup its loss by taking $900 and potentially more from his Chase account, not the $3500 that was sent by Zelle to him and then he immediately returned.\n\nOP, file a police report, talk to Wells Fargo about their theft from you.  They had no right to take any money from you, from what you describe you did nothing wrong and Wells Fargo no right to seek restitution from you for anything reimbursed to your former roommate.\n\nYour former roommate may in fact be the scammer in this.",

You have a right to see what\u2019s on it. \n\nAnd get off the phone. Send a certified letter, with return signature card, to a chase fraud Dept address demanding confirmation that it was in fact Wells Fargo that withdrew your $900 (how do you know it wasn\u2019t another scammer? ) and an explanation for why they allowed Wells Fargo to do so. \n\nYou can\u2019t be mamsy-pamsy with stuff like this.

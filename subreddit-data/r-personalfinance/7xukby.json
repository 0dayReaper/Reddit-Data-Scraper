When she called to set up an appointment, I said \"Before we do that, are you a fiduciary?\" She said yes. I said \"Great, I'd love to set up an appointment!\" When I got there I saw a plaque on her desk saying she was a broker. I read online that a broker is NOT the same as a fiduciary. I asked her about it and she said, \"Let me explain to you what a fiduciary is... blah blah blah... so I consider myself a fiduciary.\" \n\nShe thinks that I, 30, should invest my inheritance in a deferred annuity for retirement. I have ~60k earmarked for retirement and the rest of the inheritance earmarked for current emergency fund and paying off current bills. \n\n",

They can get in real legal trouble for selling you a plan that gives them a huge commission but isn't the best plan for you. Often their pay will be based on % of assets managed or a flat rate instead of hidden by commissions, this is to avoid any legal issues surrounding making money off how your assets are managed.\n\nTo take it to extremes, a non-fiduciary in some circumstances could invest all your money into his friend's businesses, get kick back from his friends, and you may never see your money again, and your legal recourse may be limited and they may be within the law to do as such.

Not really a \"kickback\" scenario, but something a fiduciary would never do. \n\nOP Sued and \"won\" but didn't get hardly any of the money back. ",

The CFP board rules state we must act as one, but any broker can get a CFP and not be subject to the fiduciary regulations. Being listed on Brokercheck doesn't mean they are a fiduciary, it means they are registered brokers. The woman OP is talking about is probably one of these brokers. What you are looking for are the words Registered Investment Advisor, and they will be able to show you their ADV or Brochure to prove it. \nIf you don't have enough money to work with someone who will charge you a fee for assets under management, look for CFPs who charge flat fees for a financial plan, then ask them to build you a portfolio of low-cost mutual funds that you can implement on your own. Do not let them sell you insurance products (unless you NEED life insurance), and annuities are insurance products. \n",

As another commenter said, lawyers are a good example outside the financial arena.  Another example would be a trustee of a trust for which you are the beneficiary (for example, if your parents died, and a very close relative was named trustee, and he looked out for your financial interests like a loving parent would--that's how every fiduciary should behave).  \n\nTheoretically (i.e., assuming they take their duty seriously), you should be able to have complete trust in someone who owes you a fiduciary duty.  For that reason, there are serious consequences for breaching the fiduciary duty (lawyers can get disbarred for it).  It's basically the \"highest standard of care\" that you can owe another person under the law (based on contract).",

I believe it's also something that's certified (generally, I won't claim that's universal cause I don't know).\n\nUsually we use the term in relation to investments and money handling. There's brokers that try to sell you something and so some will act almost like car salesmen trying to get the best margin. Or there's brokers who are certified as fiduciaries and they still make money on what they sell you, but they have to view everything from your perspective and make a good faith effort to get the best outcome for you.\n\nOutside of finance the term can be applied to people like lawyers, attorney-in-fact (someone with your power of attorney), or even doctors, teachers, and priests. In those cases it's not necessarily certified beforehand, but if it went to court a judge may decide that a fiduciary relationship should be implied to exist.\n\nHope that helps.",

For example,  lawyers, medical doctors, and psychologists all have a fiduciary relationship with their patients/clients. Lawyers who are trustees of trusts or executors of wills often perform as fiduciaries in a financial capacity for their clients. Special rules apply that require a fiduciary to act in the client's best interest and failure to do so would be considered malpractice or illegal. Attorney-client privilege, doctor-patient confidentiality, not misleading your client's for personal financial gain, etc., all are requirements (elements of various duties) imposed on a fiduciary according to the fiduciary relationship. In terms of finance, an investor with a fiduciary relationship with a client would have various legal duties including adhering to the \"prudent investor rule\" that requires the fiduciary to make objectively and reasonably prudent investments under all the circumstances (I.e., if a reasonable investor wouldn't invest in something, it would be illegal for your fiduciary investor to invest in that thing) ... if the people at your credit union, or anywhere for that matter, aren't willing to sack up and form a fiduciary relationship with you to invest your money then don't do it, full stop. You'll have to probably pay more to get an investor willing to form a fiduciary relationship with you (by contract) but it's worth it ... Or just put your money in a standard investment portfolio rather than one directed at the investors discretion (standard portfolios often get as much a return on investment as directed/customized portfolios).",

The bond component is set up to preserve principle. The underlying assets are usually in a derivative instrument, and the customer shares in the returns (or losses) of that instrument. The derivative component is to give the customer upside potential. \n\nSo, if I took your money and put it into a combined product that contained a bond and orange juice futures (*Trading Places!*) instrument, that would be an example of a structured note.

The reason why they usually suck is they typically have excess costs associated with them that are completely unnecessary(insurance, riders, fat commissions for that sweet \"fiduciary\" lady at the bank, insurance company's Christmas party, etc) and the tax benefits are not ideal compared to a lot of other options.

And because it's guaranteed returns, it is can't be a good return for you since the company needs to have a good return to turn a profit. And assuming I'm understanding annuities correctly, you get these payments for the period (say 30 years) and then that's it. Where if you invest yourself, you would have better returns, time to wait out the market in a downturn, and more money at the end of 30 years than you started with.\n\nEdit: OP is specifically talking about a deferred annuity, which is an alternative/additional tax deferred retirement savings method, but one that seems to have particularly high fees for cancelling or transferring funds, and would incur IRS penalties for receiving distributions before 59.5 years old. So you pay a big chunk of money now for guaranteed income in 30-35 years. Except you have no idea how the market or inflation will change over those 30 years, so your guaranteed income could be severely undervalued. And you would lose a big chunk if you try to switch out for a plan with better returns.",

A deferred annuity is just a savings vehicle that can be invested in anything from a fixed cash investment to indexed or active equity funds.  The insurance company gives you back whatever percentage you want after the term has been satisfied. \n\nYou're thinking of an immediate annuity which is entirely different.

They never got in trouble for opening up unauthorized accounts or rearranging overdraft fees to cause the most chaos or anything like that. I suppose I could switch to another CU but I do feel a certain sense of loyalty to them bc the actual employees of the CU have always been above-and-beyond great and the no-fees and shit like I mentioned when I didn't have any money.

Yep, **fraud**, cause that's what shes doing. She knows what her title is, and giving herself a different title, or job designation is, in this case, a fraudulent guarantee of services she is not legally able to provide.

There's always a better product elsewhere with better returns with lower commissions/fees/cost.  The CU will never refer you to Vanguard funds, for example.  So now you can prove that you aren't the dupe that they thought you were.  Withdraw every single penny of that investment, plus any excess cash that you don't need parked there for uses beyond your immediate monthly purchases.    I suggest that you open 3 other accounts, one Internet-only checking account, a brokerage account, and a no-load, low-fee, no commission mutual fund account.   For example, I suggest accounts from Bank of Internet USA, Fidelity, and Vanguard for each of those purposes, respectively.  Why? BoIUSA pays up to  1.25% on your checking balance, based on kickbacks for a minimum number of direct deposits, online purchases and in-person card swipe purchases.   Fidelity has low cost trade and a good trading platform with some good ETF mutual funds.  Vanguard has some the best mutual funds with the lowest costs, particularly for index funds.  Each serves its purpose well.  There are other choices as well, if you do your research to determine is something else might be slightly better for you in some regard.  But if you don't have any better choices at this point, those are excellent starting points for most new investors.   \n\nThose people at the CU are only pretending to be your friends.  Friends don't identify you as a sucker waiting to be ripped off with stupidly lousy investments with a commissioned broker who pretends she's a fiduciary manager just to get her greedy little fingers around your newly fattened pocketbook.  If you stay with the CU, you just became their little bitch.  They were waiting for you.  Your loyalty is wasted and inappropriate for those lying, deceptive, disingenuous wolves in sheep's clothing.  Their actions are revolting.   \n\nI had a similar situation occur with my 70+ year old parents who were targeted by tellers to a commissioned \"investment adviser\" when they made a large deposit.   The large deposit was the proceeds of a draw from a home equity line of credit that was going to be immediately used to purchase investment property that I was in the process of buying for them.   Somehow my parents got suckered into putting the money into a 2 year CD, which is beyond crazy if you knew where the large deposit was coming from and what it was going to be used for.   I was livid when I learned what happened after the fact, when I expected the funds to be ready to be sent to the escrow accounts.   \n\nThat broker and bank manager didn't realize how close they came to being criminally charged for elder financial exploitation and abuse.  I put the fear of God into them when I told them what the consequences would be if they didn't immediately cancel the CD transaction and close the new accounts they created at the same time.  The properties we purchased are now worth about 3 times what we paid, by the way, which is a rather higher return than 1% yield that CD was scheduled to return.  The rental income alone is more than a 15% annual return on investment.",

There are certain situations where that makes sense, like if you are moving into a life care community at age 70 and want to make sure your rent and health care costs will be covered until you die. There is only one reason to recommend such a product to a 30 year old, and that is that annuity brokers get paid a fat commission for getting someone to sign up. ",

Why would someone put money into an annuity when they will almost certainly not live long enough to get back what they put in?  Why not just keep the money and use it as needed. Then when you die it can be passed on to relatives?  Is it a matter of working around a lack of personal control on spending?",

Annuities do not need to be annuitized nor are you required to keep the funds in an annuity product beyond the terms specified (typically 3, 5, 7 years for fixed and variable, often times indexed annuities go out to 10yrs). These can be incredible tools for the right people. \n\nHaving said that, recommending an annuity for a 30 year old is terrible advice. Annuities are, generally, wrong for younger people because their are IRS penalties for accessing the funds before 59.5.\n\nShame on her for representing herself as a fiduciary when she\u2019s not. ",

Your basic research may have saved yourself thousands of dollars or more over the long run.\n\nI'll second /u/dequeued's suggestion to seek out paid advice if you're not completely comfortable. The \"free\" financial advisors are the ones that usually don't provide good advice, as you found out. Advisors that charge a percentage of your money to manage your assets can be better (though not always, given that Edward Jones and some of the other notoriously bad players in the industry have switched from commission to AUM models), and you have to be careful as the fees can be highly variable between firms (Vanguard is at the low end at 0.30%; 0.50% is fairly common, but it's not uncommon to see 1% or higher fees for asset management). In my opinion, the most cost-effective way to get advice is to pay an hourly fee for a set number of hours to come up with a detailed financial plan; costs for this type of service can vary quite a bit, but depending on the size of your inheritance it might be worth spending the $1000-$2000 for a detailed, unbiased plan that you can take and implement at the financial institution of your choice.",

You won\u2019t get one individual advisor, but you get a team of advisors you set-up appointments with at anytime. \n\nThe fee is dirt cheap too, 0.3% annually. So on 60k that is $180 per year. Albeit, the main reason it is so cheap is because they don\u2019t have physical offices so it\u2019ll all be email/phone/video conference, but if you\u2019re looking for inexpensive help managing your investments and don\u2019t really care about being able to go in and sit down in an office it is pretty much impossible to beat.

These are insurance products that are sold as investment products.  There are several types, including and not limited to:  \nDeferred, including subtypes of variable, indexed, and fixed, and   \nImmediate  \n\nDeferred annuities are invested in something or promise a flat rate of return over a period of time until you either pull money out or turn them into immediate annuities.  \n\nImmediate annuities - you give them a lump sum and they pay you a stated amount for as long as you live.  \n  \nDeferred annuities are generally sold to people based on fear of the investment markets.  They will use the word guaranteed at least 50 times.  And yes, they are guaranteed to be the most expensive means of investing you will encounter.  Of the subtypes, indexed seem to be the worst of the bunch - avoid!  I personally would never recommend a deferred annuity unless the products dramatically change.  \n  \nImmediate annuities have a place in a small set of circumstances - if there is a real concern that you would outlive your assets, they can provide a guaranteed income stream in retirement.  If you have everything invested appropriately and have planned and saved as you should for retirement then you would be better off with a well diversified, appropriately allocated portfolio of stocks and bonds.  \n  \nThere is some research that is starting to suggest that there are a few deferred-immediate annuity products hitting the market that may have a place in a portfolio to guard against longevity risk.  They may allow you to spend a little more in the early years of retirement, knowing that you have protection in place for the later years.  I personally have not found a case this fits yet, but I may one day.  \n  \nIf an attorney is advising your husband in this direction, it may be to make your husband comfortable knowing that you would have access to a steady stream of income if you outlive him.  It can be a way for him to have control over assets post-death, and this may again be because he is concerned about your well being. I would contend there are better ways, but I do not have the facts.",

They are allowed to put their own interests above their clients.\n\n\nPractically speaking, that means a fiduciary is legally prohibited from selling you a product unless it leads to the best* outcome for you.  So, if a fiduciary sells you a product because they will make high commission from it, that is a breach of their fiduciary duty and you can sue them for damages.  This is not the case for non-fiduciaries.  That financial advisor at BOA, for example, can absolutely sell you a high fee, shitty, bottom-tier financial product purely because they get a big commission from it with no legal repercussions (unless they're also committing fraud or something).\n\n\n*This is a bit of an oversimplification.",

Something analogous to a bar association for attorneys. 2) complain vigorously but reasonably to the credit union. They do not want someone connected to them who is making trouble like this. Explain to them that she is a liability and that by keeping her, they up there chances of being on the wrong side of a \u201cv.\u201d in a civil action.

There is no considering yourself something that's legally protected, you were lied to and there is a process that needs to be followed with your state to make sure no one else gets lied to and that this person stops what they are doing.

You should also definitely report this.\n\nI don't know how strict regulators would be on this since you didn't actually end up losing anything but a little time, but you definitely want to report this to at least the following:\n\n- Report them through BrokerCheck by looking them up through [here](https://brokercheck.finra.org/).\n- [Report them to the NCUA](https://www.ncua.gov/services/Pages/fraud-hotline.aspx).\n- Report them to your state attorney general. While you may not have lost money, they may have pulled this bait-and-switch on others. \n- The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/).\n\nYou may also want to file a complaint and write a letter to the credit union. Remember that when you deposit money, you become a shareholder in the credit union, meaning you have a stake in the union. Meaning if they're hit with a large lawsuit or fine, you could suffer from reduced interest rates, etc. \n\nWhen you write this letter, make sure to not mention the other official complaints, because a good credit union shouldn't have to wait for regulators to do what's best for their members.\n\nThen leave a review on every website you can find (Yelp, Google Maps, etc.) based on their response. Give them a low score and explain why in detail. While some sites may allow businesses to delete or hide bad reviews, a longer detailed review is harder to bury.",

            "comment": "The key components of being a fiduciary are 1) being properly registered and 2) being compensated off a persistency fee rather than a sales charge on the initial purchase. With my understanding of the products I have access to with my firm an annuity is not likely to fall under the second requirement I listed. This doesn't mean this is a bad person to work with outright, but it does show they don't know the actual definition. Granted, I had to look up the exact requirements before paying to make sure I had my facts straight. A deferred annuity might for into your plan if guaranteed income for life is something you could benefit from and want, but if you prefer maintaining all the risks involved with investing and don't care as much about guaranteed payouts or income for life then an advisory service held to the fiduciary standard might be more your speed. Just understand, fiduciary does not apply to all products and all circumstances if the advisor in question does need to adhere to it within one of their services. Hope this helps.",

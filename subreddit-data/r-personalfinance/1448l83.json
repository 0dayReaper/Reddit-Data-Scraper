    "postText": "Hello all. I am trying to minimize my expenses. My spouse and I have large amounts of student loans. We both work full time. The federal loan site said it would be most likely cheaper to apply for an income based repayment plan if we file our taxes together, which we do. Is this always the case? I applied for the income payment plan with both of our incomes and it for not seem very doable. Is it ok to apply again with only my income to see if it is cheaper per month? Thank you. Please let me know if this is not the right sub, first post here.",

            "comment": "Just keep in mind the other terms of the loan remain unchanged. lower payments mean you will pay more interest over the life of the loan and it will take even longer to pay off. While cheaper monthly, it\u2019s more expensive overall. Make sure the money you save by doing this is going somewhere useful and not just becoming disposable income",

    "postText": "I made the very stupid mistake of getting a loan from Fair stone to pay some unexpected expenses. The annual percentage rate is 39.99. I really want to get ahead of this loan and pay it off quicker. Ive even contemplated letting it go to collections to remove the interest but I dont want it to hit my credit hard as im trying my best to better it. My current score is 640 and Im trying to build it to 700. This is all the debt i have but definitely takes a toll on my as the 127$ i pay bi weekly barley even touches the principal any ideas would be helpful",

Going to collections won't exactly help your situation... \n\n&gt; This is all the debt i have but definitely takes a toll on my as the 127$ i pay bi weekly barley even touches the principal any ideas would be helpful\n\nYou need to be paying towards the principal, especially at 40%.",

Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors.",

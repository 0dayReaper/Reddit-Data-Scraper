Now that I'm older I'd like to use one (and IMMEDIATELY pay off the purchases I make with that credit card with my actual money) so that I can get air miles and benefits and build my credit to buy a house eventually. What do you think?",

Most of the cards with really good travel rewards have annual fees. \n\nAlso, paying off the credit card as soon as you make the purchase is a lot of administrative faff. Pay the statement balance by the due date. Easy peasy. I have all my cards set to autopay the statement balance 3 days before the due date. I never have to worry to that there won't be enough money because I never put anything on my card that I couldn't afford to pay cash for.",

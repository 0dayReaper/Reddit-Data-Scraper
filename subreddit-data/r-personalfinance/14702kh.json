    "postText": "This is for USA. My parents wanted to grant me power of attorney over their funds while they are overseas. However, instead they just opened up an account and put me on the account, and moved 6-figures USD in there. Does this trigger a potential tax issue for me?\n\nI do not plan to use the funds for myself at all, but simply to administer things and process wires for them on their behalf while they are traveling. Any ideas?\n\nMy CPA is not sure.",

If you took money out or used it for yourself, it might be considered a gift, which they'd have to report on their taxes but probably wouldn't pay taxes on (unless they've previously gifted you millions of dollars).",

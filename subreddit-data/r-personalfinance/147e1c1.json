    "postText": "Hi everyone, hoping to get some help for a family member. \n\nShe is 6k in debt and the interest rate is 55%. She is Mexican, we\u2019ll call her Maya but her daughter is American (let\u2019s call her Lisa) and has never had a credit card. I don\u2019t know that Maya can open up a new credit card with the debt she has in Mexico but could her daughter open up a first time credit card with low interest rate for the first year.\n\nTo note, I will be helping with getting the debt lower but I\u2019m hoping for a long term solution where the 55% doesn\u2019t continue accruing. \n\nThe advice I\u2019d love is first time credit cards that offer low interest rates.\n\nAdded info: She is paying $350 per month and has offered to pay me $300. I\u2019m trying to figure out a way to build trust of her paying me back while the debt doesn\u2019t eat her alive.\n\nI\u2019m not comfortable losing 6k but offered 1k but that won\u2019t slow it down enough.",

But if the mother is here in the USA and just has outstanding debt in Mexico you\u2019re trying to pay off then I\u2019m pretty sure a debt consolidator would still do it here but I\u2019m not sure. Either way it would probably be worth a phone call to one just to get their insight",

To pay it off in six months she needs to make payments of $ 1,166.40 per month. The six month payment plan would save her close to $1k on interest. 12 months it will cost her $1,933.65.",

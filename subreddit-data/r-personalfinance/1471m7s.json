    "postText": "My Wife and I are moving in a great direction financially. We do have an almost 2 year old. We bring in just shy of 9K a month in salary. I do have other side gigs that I do that on average (If I actually put time in to running these events) would bring in about another $4,000 a month after taxes as well.. Sometimes I run the events, other times I just rather spend time with my family.\n\nWe have paid off all our credit card debt. Our Monthly car note is $800 a month (Owe about $32,000. The interest on this note is 2.5%. (The other vehicle is paid off). The kicker is my wife has massive student loans. The private loans previously was 120k and we have it down to about 80k. Paying $800 a month often more, but $800 is due every month. The interest rate on the private loan is 6.3%. She does have about 20k in federal loans that we hope to get forgiven. But when it starts back up, we may be paying between $400-$500 a month. \n\nWe hope to get a house. Our lease on our apartment was up. We just didn't feel like it was smart to go month to month at $2,000+ a month up from $1,500 a month. So we moved in with my mom and just saving our money. By the end of August we will have about $60k saved up (Thats not including the $4,000 a month if I run these events). \n\nThe question is, what should we do.. Obviously the private student loans have the most interest, but will take the longest to pay off. Paying off the car, would eat about half of our savings, but gives us an immediate $800 a month in extra money to maybe put towards the loans or the ability to afford a bigger monthly mortgage as well as just overall flexibility..\n\nPart of me, wants to use 50% of the events money to put extra towards the student loan every month and the other 50% to put towards the car.. Take a little from the savings( which we are saving close to $5,500 a month) that we are putting away and also add maybe another $800 a month towards the student loans.....\n\nI ball park our house cost around $350,000 which would put us at about $2,500 a month in mortgage payments....\n\nJust don't know what debt to tackle or if I should just not worry about it, get a house now and figure everything else out after we get it...",

            "comment": "Sounds like you're in a pretty great situation either way, so at least these are the \"good\" kind of money problems to have. :-)\n\n2.5 percent is less than inflation right now, so there's not a ton of incentive to pay that off before the higher interest loan unless you're primarily interested in dropping payments for cash flow. The snowball method is great psychologically but if you're looking to optimize interest paid, the avalanche method suggests you should prioritize the highest interest - i.e., the private loan. If you put that events $4,000/month on top of your $800 payment, you'll be done with it in a little over a year. Turning that to tackle your other balances, and you'll be done with the other two loans in another ~6-7 months after that.\n\nIf you redirect some of your monthly savings, that timeline shrinks a lot faster to the point where you could be debt free in about a year, but the question then becomes how long are you and your family OK with living together? Two years, one year, six months? This is probably the main question.\n\nI used [this spreadsheet](https://www.vertex42.com/Calculators/debt-reduction-calculator.html) when I started my journey to a positive net worth, and it does a nice job showing the interest impact of each strategy.\n\nOther things to ask, is the $60K savings your emergency fund and buying a house fund? What is your down payment goal? Closing costs and maintenance can really impact your savings goals.",

    "postText": "Hi all\n\nI have cash savings of around 20k and I invested 10k in a S&amp;S ISA (fidelity US fund, European, world) last year, in July 22, which has given a 8% return so far. \n\nAfter taxes, bill setc and pension I manage to save around \u00a3800 pcm and contribute \u00a3100 into my S&amp;S ISA. \n\nMy question is should I put more cash into my s&amp;s isa every month at this time and keep less in cash savings (losing value)?  I consider my 20k cash savings as my emergency fund. Although I don't want to lose money and realise stocks may be risky at this time?\n\nOther option I fixed rate savings but don't want to pay tax on my interest.",

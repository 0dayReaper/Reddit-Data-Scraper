The car serves us well, but I always wonder whether we need another car in case the first car fails (flat tires, maintenance, accidents, etc). On the other hand, a 2nd car is financially questionable because it will only be used very occasionally if the 1st runs normal. What do people in similar situation do? ",

My backup is a 97 Chevy pickup I\u2019ve had since high school (15 years ago). I kept it when I got a newer pickup for my primary. It costs me $130/year to register. And with only liability insurance (as it\u2019s not worth enough to me for comprehensive/collision) it only raises my policy $20/6 months due to a multi-car discount. It is worth its base cost of $170/year to keep around. I could barely rent a pickup for a day at that rate if I needed to. When family visits I don\u2019t mind lending them this pickup, which I wouldn\u2019t do with my newer one. I also can use it for chores that would beat my newer rig up. It also allows me to schedule repairs to my primary vehicle at my convenience because I have the old one to drive.",

It's great not having to pay registration and insurance for two cars when we really only needed one.  We all ride bikes to work/school. During the summer, things get a little tricky because of camp locations and work schedules, but we've worked out a system that works for us.\n\nWe also live near family, though, so can usually borrow a car or catch a ride somewhere if needed, though we've only needed to do so once in two years.  Between bikes, Uber, the bus (not great, but something...), and family, we're well-covered transportation-wise.",

Get a portable battery charger, especially if you have kids who might play with/bump the interior lights.  Take your car for maintenance at places that offer loaners or shuttles.  Rental coverage on your insurance policy will cover you in the event you can't use your car due to a loss.\n\nRE insurance, since this is the only vehicle you have, make sure you carry comp+collision.  This coverage on my 2022 vehicle is $35/month.  It's not super cheap, but it's way cheaper than replacing my 35K vehicle on my own because a hit and run driver can't be located or is uninsured, I am dumb and hit a stationary object (or more likely, one of my kids does), a storm knocks a tree over onto the vehicle, etc.",

We\u2019re lucky that we have parents living near by who are happy to help out (for example today my car was due in the garage for a service and I knew it would take a while so I got my mum to pick me up from the garage and run me home so I didn\u2019t have to wait.) I could have got a bus or a taxi/cab though if she wasn\u2019t available, or just waited while the car was serviced. Obviously everyone\u2019s circumstances are different but since we dropped to 1 car 18 months ago there are probably about 10 occasions tops when a second car would have been useful, but we\u2019ve always found a work around. If you compare the cost of cab/Uber when you need a ride vs the cost of running a whole second car it will work out way cheaper I\u2019m sure to be a 1 car family \ud83d\udc4d",

This sub tends to lean on the eat only beans and retire at 35 to eat beans till you die alone (in the dark to save power) side sometime.\n\nBe prudent, save enough, don\u2019t have high interest debt. After that use your money however it makes sense for you.",

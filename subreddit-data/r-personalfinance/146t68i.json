    "postText": "I took out a 10 yr private loan to pay for my grad school. I still have about $25k left to pay and have a 5.04% interest rate. \n\nI currently have about $40k in a high yield savings account (4.55% interest) and save $1k per month into this account and $500 per month in my short term savings account. I contribute towards my IRA and employee match 401k accounts as well. \n\nI do want to buy a house someday and I rather not be paying a mortgage and a student loan at the same time. I currently rent and pay $1k per mon and make $100k. \n\nSince my student loan is looming over my head, my want to just pay it all off and be done and over with it and just up my monthly savings to $2k per month. Is that a good idea? \n\nAny and all advice is greatly appreciated!",

This means that you are net positive by about $580/y *because of the current balances*.\n\nI am not a financial advisor, but I think you are in a good position to pay down your private loan. If it is an open loan, consider putting the extra $500 to $1k towards the payments each month. This will have your loan paid down in about two years. Note that taxes and other variables will impact these calculations. Because the difference is so small, these variables could easily make paying down the loan a net positive.\n\nI don't think that it would be worth removing your savings to pay down the loan immediately, and your savings will be important for a down payment when you are ready to mortgage. Because what that effectively does is set back your mortgage plans by at least 3 months and gives you less flexibility to cushion unexpected finanicial hits. After reducing to $15k to remove the loan, you would be getting net $682/y -- a measly expected gain of only  $102/y.\n\nInstead, just allocate a bigger portion of your income to loan payments and you'll have the best of both options. You would probably be ready to mortgage in 1-3 years \ud83d\udc4d",

That's because the debt has a fixed monthly cost as far as a mortgage lender is concerned and your $100K/yr income should cover it no problem.\n\nAlso note that 4.55% in a HYSA is pre-tax, you'll need to knock about 30% off for tax so the real rate is more like 3.2%.\n\nSo it comes down to your plan with housing. If you want to buy a house sometime before your student loans are to be paid off under the current plan then do NOT pay off the student loan. If you want to buy a house after the current repayment plan would end, then go ahead and pay it off then increase your savings amount to repay yourself.",

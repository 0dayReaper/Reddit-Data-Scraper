    "postText": "Basically the title.\n\nMy mom recently had a surgery to get a pain implant/stimulator put into her back. She's lived with chronic pain for years. Insurance pre-approved the surgery.\n\nNow, mom got a bill saying that they won't cover it. It's over 40k.\n\nMy parents are in their 60's on a fixed income, mom has been disabled since her 40's and has disability payments come through. Dad is retired but is working part time for $12.50/hr. They both get SS. No debt except for maybe a vehicle? (Not sure if they have it paid off or not.) \n\nThere's no way they can afford a 40k hospital bill though. They would need to sell their house to cover it (and they wouldn't have other housing or be able to afford other housing.)\n\nHow can I help my parents? Surely this has got to be some kind of mess up, right?",

            "comment": "IF you can't get this resolved through insurance (which you might be able to do):\n\n1.) Hospitals/providers will typically allow generous interest-free payment plans. As long as your mom is paying SOMETHING regularly, they won't send to collections. Our hospital offered us a payment plan as low as $50/month on a $8k debt.\n\n2.) Hospitals/providers will also usually offer an \"uninsured\" discount, even if your mom was was technically insured but the claim is denied. This could be \\~15%.\n\n3.) I agree with the suggestion to ask for financial assistance. My wife and I went through this recently. I hated the idea of assistance, because it felt like charity, and we don't feel like a charity case. But the pricing was so predatory, and the hospital did NOT negotiate in good faith, so we accepted the assistance and they ended up with NOTHING instead of the couple thousand we were offering.",

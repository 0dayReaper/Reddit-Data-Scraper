    "postText": "Currently have a mortgage of $1940/month.\n\nI bring in 5,152/month after taxes and withholdings. Plan on renting my home out for 2400 a month. Rental agency takes 10%. so in total: 5,352/month. I have 23.3k in the bank. Mostly there in case something breaks in my home but it was built just a year ago and a recent inspection checked out really well. Don't expect major repairs but you never know.\n\nIf I were to rent a home for 2,975 month, that would be 55% of my take home pay, and leaves me with $2,177 left over.\n\nMy monthly expenses:\n\n* Car: 300\n* Groceries: 350\n* Pet needs: 125\n* Pest control: 70\n* Electric/water/internet: 205\n* Gym/sports: 129\n* Home insurance: 104\n* Entertainment/food out: approx 175. (thank god I like to cook and my hobbies are cheap)\n\n1458 total expenses on average. Looking at my bank statements sometimes it's a little more, sometimes it's a little less. This leaves me with approx $895 wiggle room for a rainy day (on top of my savings which aren't huge but a little cushion) . Seems do-able, but compared to having 1,754 left over if I stayed where I am, of course it seems silly and a bad idea financially.\n\nSo with this, on a scale of 0-10, how bad of a move is this? Should I just suck it up in my current place for another year and save up that extra money for when the interest rates calm down a bit in a year+?\n\nthe TLDR of why I'm doing this is due to interest rates preventing me from selling my current home. Renting in the area I'm in love with is pricey. Renting houses range from 2500-3000 a month. Love my house but hate my neighborhood/location. Due to the current rates I could not afford to buy these homes and renting is the cheaper option. My current home is at a 4% interest rate and since I have only lived here a little over a year, not much equity is built. Rather rent this out opposed to sell/buy for now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

You should have rent or mortgage for your primary home at 25% or less of your take home pay so there is plenty of room in the budget after housing to save and have a comfortable lifestyle. Stay in your house, not just a year but until you\u2019ve moved up in your career and are bringing home significantly more money. Nothing wrong with keeping a house on a 4% mortgage as a rental and renting in a more desirable location yourself. That can be pretty smart in some cases, but saddling yourself with a rent payment that is such a high percentage of your income is reckless and will hurt your long time financial success.",

Work on building up a nest egg for a bigger down payment, so a mortgage on a house in the area you want will be smaller and have lower payments. Work on increasing your credit score so that you will qualify for the best rates available on a house in the area you want.",

Cute little 4/3 in a nice, quiet neighborhood and zoned for good schools.  The family that lived there for the last two years seemed nice.  A few little kids, they had a little pool in the backyard and would play out front in the street on bikes and Big Wheels.  Well, they moved out in early March.  The owner has been working on repairs ever since. Contractors at the house all day long a few days a week, he's there the other days. idk wtf these people did to the inside of that house but patching walls, repainting and laying new carpet doesn't take 3 months even if you're completely DIYing it.",

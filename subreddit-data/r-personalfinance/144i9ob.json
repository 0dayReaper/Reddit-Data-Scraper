    "postText": "I received a notice from credit karma that a collection agency had reported an unpaid medical bill to TransUnion. I never received this bill from the hospital or from the collection agency so I filed a dispute with TransUnion and wrote a dispute letter to the agency. TransUnion says they verified the debt with the CA but the CA never sent me anything verifying the debt and they never stopped reporting it. It has almost been 30 days since I sent the letter and I'm wondering what are the next steps I should take?",

How TU knows the debt was validated, and not you is worth looking into, especially because the CA is required by the FDCPA to validate a debt once its been requested by the debtor.\n\nWrite a letter to TU demanding removal, plus a copy of the original deb validation letter, with dates,  you sent to the CA.",

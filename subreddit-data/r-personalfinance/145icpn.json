    "postText": "Hi, I have a 401K account with principal from my pervious employer with just under 1K in it. Its a Roth so I already paid the taxes on it. I recently quit my job and am wondering what my options are with this balance. HR is being of little help and basically telling me to just contact principal. Could I just leave the balance in the account? Is there a minimum that I would have to keep in there or? Could I transfer it to a IRA without penalties? I noticed Robinhood offers an IRA could I transfer it there? How would I go about it? I do not want to simply cash out the account because from what I here there is a huge penalty for doing so. Any help / advise would be appreciated. Thank you!",

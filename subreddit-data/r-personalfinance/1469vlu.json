As a consequence, when they take money out from traditional IRA, they add the amount back to taxable income. This is the default assumption.\n\nHowever, they can also claim that the traditional IRA contribution is nondeductible. Once they submit this claim to the IRS, they can later claim \"$6500 of the amount inside my traditional IRA was never deducted, so don't tax me again when I take it out.\"\n\n\"Take it out\" = to withdraw or to convert out",

It's not clear why they ask it, as the deductibility determination is reported by YOU when you fill out your Tax Return.  Filling out Form 8606 Part 1 would be the spot to tell the IRS that it is non-deductible.\n\n* https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=394155\n\nIf you used any of the other major brokerages (Fidelity/Vanguard/Schwab), you would not encounter this question.",

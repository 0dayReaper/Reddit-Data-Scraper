If you're really unlucky (and/or in a 'small world' kind of business), it's possible that the HR personnel share even more than that. Specific employers (government, law enforcement, etc) will almost certainly get functionally your whole file.\n\nSo if you are fired with cause, they probably will find out about it just by checking the references. And instead of getting an opportunity to explain it in a way that makes sense, they just found out you're a fucking liar, and they're going to believe the worst about the termination, so your ass is done. \n\nAs a general rule, lying to prospective employers is absolutely moronic. You're pretty much just praying that they never find out, because if they do even if they would have still hired you if they knew what you were covering, you will almost certainly be fired for lying to them The only possible situation in which it can be done is if the lie is covering a 100% dealbreaker and there is no possible way to get hired without it. Even then, you should consider yourself living on borrowed time. \n\nThe thing is - unless it was something profoundly stupid, most hiring mangers get it. You just have to explain it to them in a way that makes sense to them. It's not a dealbreaker in most cases, it's just a speedbump in the interview you should be prepared for. Lying to a hiring manager will get you cut. Don't volunteer it, but if you get asked, the truth is always the best option. Or at least your version of the truth. \n\nThe math isn't complex - Lying will get you removed from the hiring process 99.9% of the time (and if it's the .01%, get the fuck out now). Telling the truth is rarely a 100% dealbreaker. Lying for years (the duration of your employment) is surprisingly hard. Unless it's one of the cases where there's no other way, lying is dumb. Welcome to the world - lies are punished, the truth is rarely rewarded. \n\nLike it or not, the employer -&gt; employee relationship is heavily favored to the employer. Just because they do it doesn't mean you have some moral right to do it back to them unless you really like being unemployed.",

There are definitely no federal restrictions against it. \n\nCompanies generally standardize it to 'fired with cause, rehireable vs not' as a one size fits all policy, but there's no actual protections against them telling anyone who asks why you were fired on a federal level, and state to state varies. And even if it were actually prohibited, there's absolutely nothing you can do about watercooler talk between hiring managers that know each other.

I was hunting my top opportunity and had been trying to get an in for 5 months and finally got that in.\n\nI had originally told them I was being extremely selective and was specifically targeting this opportunity before starting a wider job search (this was reciprocal apparently which was nice to hear).\n\nAnyway, 10 days into the interview process and just waiting for the offer letter that I was told was coming, my entire company was furloughed. We were 3 months into bankruptcy proceedings, so this wasn't a terrible surprise, but it did happen about a month before I expected it to. After receiving the news I sat down on my stairs and called the hiring manager at the opportunity and just told him my situation had changed and I was needing to either wrap this or begin my wider job search immediately. \n\nWe had a salary negotiation right then and there and I had the full offer letter 4 hours later. It's been everything I thought it would be in the months since.\n\nSo depending on your feel on the interview, it might not be a terrible idea to let them know you have some hurry in the personal forecast. But I feel that's highly situational and only you can determine if it applies to you, while not mentioning anything is generally great advice.\n\nGood luck!",

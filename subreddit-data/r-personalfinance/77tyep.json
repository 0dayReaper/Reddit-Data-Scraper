If anyone knows of any legitimate part time work from home jobs that does not require selling items I'd appreciate it!\n\nEDIT: just wanted to say I am very overwhelmed by the amount of comments on this post. Please know I am reading each of your comments. Thank you all for your insight! I really didn't think this post would have so many ideas!",

You take orders and payment info over the phone for when people want to order from those infomercials they see on TV. When they say \"call the number on your screen\", you'd be the one to answer!\n\nYou're paid per minute on the phone, so your paycheck will vary. But the scheduling is insanely flexible. ",

It's corporate so he is talking to companies like American Express and lining up flights for businessmen and isn't dealing with disgruntled honeymooners that missed their flight.He makes like $50k and has all he benefits, including discounted airfare and lodging from more or less anywhere in the US. \n\nThe system that they use is called Sabre Global Distribution System. It's basically just learning all the shorthand for the airports. The internet has a bunch of practice tests for the Sabre system also so you can practice memorizing all of that stuff. \n\nGood luck with your search!",

You click through the tasks and record yourself talking out loud about how usable the site is. \n\nThe business's goal is to test sites for the average consumer, so there aren't really any requirements to work there. If I'm remembering right, the first one or two site reviews you do are used to evaluate whether you do a good enough job to be able to do more reviews. \n\nThe biggest downside is that it can be hard to get many websites to review, and if you don't act immediately when you get the offer, all the slots could be filled up. \n\nAll in all, not a super reliable way to make money consistently, but it can help you make a little money on the side.

Just wanted to put in my two cents for those who are curious.\n\nThe one thing is this is not a full time (or even part time job). Realistically, you can probably make $10-40 a week, but it really depends on the available opportunities. But since most tests take 15-20 mins each and pay $10, it's worth your time.\n\nYou are notified by email when a new test is available and you have to act pretty fast when a test pops up since they close it once they have enough testers. So, this probably works best if you have a schedule that allows you to do a test at short notice. I'm a student and at home studying a lot so it works well for me.\n\nAlso, check out Validately and UserZoom, both are similar to usertesting and pay just as well.\n",

Pearson, ETS, Measurement Inc, etc. Most of them have distributive work (what they call work at home), where you train to score an assessment and then actually score it. There are different types of tests, ranging from math to writing, and all different grade levels. Average pay is around $15/hr and for most you only need a bachelor's degree. I clear about 20-30k year doing this, in addition to my day job. The downfall is that the jobs are contract based - though they issue you a w2 as opposed to a 1099, you only work periodically through the year as the students test. So it's not steady, being seasonal and all, but it's a great cash cow when it's there. ",

            "comment": "I did data entry for a year from home. Paid 13 dollars an hour and I got 30 hours a week. It was a sweet gig\n\nEDIT: Didn't know this comment would blow up. To all those inquiring, I got fairly lucky landing this job. I had a family member who worked for a company that manages low-income properties, most of which are given government subsidies to live there (Section 8 type stuff). My family member mentioned that his company needed to manually convert tenant data information from old, outdated software to a new software, and they were having trouble finding a candidate to do so. I offered.\n\n Next day, he throws my hat in the ring, and they hire me immediately, without even interviewing me. All they wanted to know was how fast I could type, as they needed to convert the data before the February of next year. I started in February by working at the office which was located about a half hour from me, but after about 2 weeks, they realized there was no reason to keep me in the office, since all I did was sit alone and key in information all day. I only had to learn to calculate basic things such as the subsidy rate for each tenant and how to classify them in the new software. I entered their SSN's, ethnicities, income, etc. \n\nThe way they tracked my hours was a little odd, though. They couldn't monitor, say, my screen, and know if I was actually working. All they could tell is if I was logged into the new software, and would take my hours directly from that. I could have easily taken advantage of that in order to get a crazy amount of money while sitting idle, but they gave me a really nice job, especially for a kid still in high school, and I respected the company my family member works for. I also wouldn't want to damage his reputation by being dishonest. After awhile, I got good at spacing out the work I was doing, and I would type as quickly and accurately as possible. Unfortunately, I knew this job had an expiration date. \n\nAfter I successfully completed the data entry job I was hired to do, I was able to get another job doing data entry through a temp agency, which is what I recommend to all of you. Although that job did not work out quite as well as my first one, it was still good pay and not difficult work. For anyone that is interested in a job doing data entry, try searching for \"data entry\" in both local job website searches AND in cities that you do not live near, and look to see if they have an option to telecommute! Additionally, temp agencies will most likely be more willing to hire you for data entry if you have at least some experience doing data entry or, apparently, if you can type very quickly! \n\nAnother option I have experience with is Rev.com. All you do is apply online to transcribe audio for them, and they will pay you $1 per audio minute if you are accepted. Good luck to you all!\n\nEDIT 2: I completely forgot to add this! I personally do not have experience with user testing, but I have friends who have had tremendous success making extra money doing this. I'd try usertesting.com for starters!",

Hour there, hour here, totaling 40 hours a week. Makes great money and has never had to leave the house for work. She works for our spending extra money. Highly recommend it.\n\nThey give you training from home online. Provide you with the mic and headset. There is a team that helps you if you have questions and there is a employee helpline that the employees can call if they can't figure something out. \n\nEmployee discounts on everything. She works mainly with returns and shopping help. Super easy. Trust me she is NOT a computer wiz. \n\nMore Info: My wife had ZERO experience. They gave her all the training online, took about a week. You log into their servers and their systems online through a VPN (Virtual Private Network). You have coaches that help you, a virtual library to lookup customer problems and resolutions. \n\nThe system is VERY automated. You click what customers says, it tells you what to do. Amazon is VERY customer driven so it wants you to make the customer happy. Very easy system to use. If you can't figure out a solution you give the call to a tier 2 person or a supervisor. \n\nI promise if you can get a job here you will keep it. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.jobs/en/locations/virtual-locations\n\n\nEdit: More Info.

                            "comment": "That's a long and complex story! I'll cut it down. Met a woman, now my wife, stbx wife. I had a very solid government job, 30 year contract, pension etc. She couldn't hold a job down, kept finding faults etc (I think she has underlining, unresolved issues due to having an unstable, unsettled up bringing). So she applied for a job with an EU agency, in Europe. This agency was based in a different country and she had it in her mind that if she got it, we were moving. She got it, we moved. I gave up my job to help her follow her dream. My qualifications were mainly in security and law enforcement. I didn't speak the language and found it difficult to find a job. My wife told me that they might be looking for report writers at her office. Not a job I was excited about, but money is money. \n\nI applied and honestly, as I have a native level of English I was hired. You see all the meetings take place with multiple different languages bring spoken and the official language is English and all reports must be submitted in business English. It really is a pain in the ass, even for a native English speaker. This job is extremely stressful with tight deadlines and boring. Now when I say boring, the initial meetings are very interesting as some of them are concerning blockchain technology, enforcement and education while others are just about finance, budgets and the like. It's after the meetings is when things get boring.\n\nI will spend entire work days (8hrs) with a pair of headphones on listening and re-listening to the same meeting over and over. It really is mind numbing. When I leave at the end of the day, I don't want to hear another human speak. I just want to get home and walk my dogs. This process will go on for days depending on the meeting/event. Headaches are part and parcel of your daily life (the amount of focus and concentration required is immense). \n\nOn the plus side, if you can figure out a way to make it \"work\" for you, it can be ok. I work from home more than from the office. If you work from home, you MUST be disciplined. You cannot be distracted easily. If you are, you will not get the work done and you will fired. You should plan for the future as this really is not a job someone should do for more than a few years, if that. There is no thanks or appreciation and while that doesn't bother me, I've seen it effect some people terribly. You will be expected to perform miracles. I was asked 9 minutes after a meeting ended if I had the report ready. It was a report that would take a week!! I got it done in a day. The real plus for a lot of people is that not many people are willing to do this job so you can get paid well a and even better if you are a freelancer. I am employed with a company now but will be going freelance in January. It will treble my income, but in the flip side, if I ain't working, I won't be getting paid so it's a calculated risk. \n\nIf you are young (20's) I would highly recommend this job to you. You will gain extremely useful skills, discipline, focus, and time management. If you are able to do this job in a field that interests you, go for it as you will have access to inform and material that your fellow students don't, not even your professor. In my situation, all my work is considered as having historical reliance meaning that all my work is entered into the archives of the EU. That's a nice thought. \n\nIf you want to apply for such a role, hit up every company, business or institution that interests you. They all need report writers/minute takers and we are hard to find.\n\nMy typing speed is faster than it was a year ago, but still not where I want it to be, I do tend to rely on the audio. I have colleagues who can tie in real time, and are not stenographers. It's crazy to watch them.\n\nI am based in Europe and not the USA. Although I do know some people who freelance for companies in the USA and it seems to be much easier to get reports done for them as they (zero offence meant by this) don't have as high standards as my European overlords.\n\nIf you can manage your time and workload efficiently, stay focused and deliver high quality reports on time, you will build a reputation very quickly.\n\nAny other questions?\n\nEdit: RIP inbox. Apologies for not getting back to you all sooner, I'm living in Europe and was asleep when the questions came in.\n\nEdit 2: If you feel i have left anything out, it have further questions, please feel free to ask me either here, or through DM. I hope I helped someone in some way. ",

If you want to teach English and have a TESOL certificate, part of your TESOL course is how to setup a lesson plan and grade students, so you should be able to charge more and have better control of what you are doing. Having said that, if you have a TESOL cert and are under 30, you would be better off going to south east Asia on a youth travel visa to teach kids of wealthy Asian people English.\n\nI am in Germany, there are classified services, similar to Craiglist, that have people looking for English teachers for their German kids. It's relatively easy to pickup a gig, casual to help somebodies kid get ready for an exam or just help out, in some parts of Germany, English is not taught as second language in schools, so the teens go to university and struggle a bit if they choose a degree that requires it, such as software development or engineering - sure, you don'T have to speak English for that, but consider how many manuals and online material are in English.\n\nI have come across people advertising 'dialogue sessions' before: you basically have a Skype pen pal that chats with you in a language of your choosing and pay them $5/hr. Just everyday conversation and some help with pronunciation and grammar.",

I've seen shirts similar to mine sell, but I spend more time on my shirts than perhaps I should. I use GIMP as my image program and I love it, so it really hasn't broken the bank to get started... I used the free GIMP program, a $100 pawn-shop laptop and (when I started) used the free library WIFI to upload the finished designs.

Knowing a second language will help a lot.\n\nAdditionally, put \"remote work\" on your resumes and cover letters. Don't call it \"work from home\" or \"stay at home.\" That's a bit too casual.\n\nMany of the jobs are freelance, but don't let that discourage you. Both of our jobs come with insurance, 401K, the whole shebang. Remember to look up where the job is based out of and understand your state's unemployment laws as well as the state that it is based out of.",

            "comment": "Yeah, there are lots of work-from-home jobs that aren't scams. What I've done, personally, is ghost writing, tattoo designs, ads quality rating for google (the application process is pretty slow, but they pay well, competitively - or did 4 or 5ish years ago - and the work is consistent), tagging advertisements for a search engine, and content research.  Currently, I license artwork to various companies. \n\n\nIn terms of pay, tagging ads paid the least (about $8 per hour. Its brainless, repetitive work, so prob makes sense that it doesnt pay as well). Licensing artwork and fonts pays the best (it's passove income. I have no idea how it breaks down hourly because I'm positively terrible about tracking that sort of thing).  \n\n\nActually, ghost writing probably paid least when you factor in the time spent finding work, which unfortunately I did not track. I did that years ago, so I dont remember exactly, but finding work took effort. \n\n\nOverall, working from home is the same as working in the real world. You provide a skill or service and are compensated. If theres an offer for a job that seems too good to be true, it is. If there's an expectation that you'll pay upfront for something required (training, supplies, products, whatever), then I would walk away. Fast. \n\n\nAlso, the application process should be similar. Anything you just sign up for is either a scam, or doesn't pay well. You should be sending them a resume (or writing samples/portfolio) and they should be sending you a contract. Sometines there is a trial or probation period, but you should be paid for your work. Dont work on spec (doing work for free in hopes of being awarded the job). ",

Google contracts a bunch of people to rate their advertisements abd weed out porn. I applied and got accepted, like, 3-6 months later. It took so long that I forgot I had even applied. If I remember correctly, you do some training and tests, and then sign a huge contract and NDA.  You contract for a year (I think the minimum requirement was 10 hours per week, but you can request time off of up to a month), and then you have to not work for a certain amount of time (maybe 9 months or a year), and then you can do anothet year long contract. At the time, there was a lot of demand for US workers who spoke second languages fluently or who had lived abroad for a long time, so they can rate for, like, South American ads. \n\n\nBut dont lie a out it. You definitely need to be very familiar with what youre rating. Overall, I enjoyed it. It wasnt time consuming and you can work whenever you have a spare hour or two. And I liked debating things with the other raters. I think it paid $15/hour. And even though it was contract, I'm pretty sure they withheld taxes. ",

It really depends what you're selling though. For instance, clothing from some brands can sell on eBay used for $30-$40, but can be picked up at many Goodwills for $5. You'd be surprised what all can be found at yard sales or on Craigslist (calculators, iPod's, gaming consoles, etc). \n\n&gt;Second, doesn't Ebay have crushing fees and commissions that eat your margin?\n\nFees generally make up for around 13% of the total sale price. It's trended upwards since eBay first began, but still leaves a lot of room to make a profit unless you're operating on extremely thin profit margins. \n\n&gt;Lastly, doesn't Ebay also have a customer-first policy where someone can claim they didnt receive or didnt like your item and then they just withhold your payment?\n\nIf a buyer claims they didn't receive the item it will come down to the tracking information. If tracking shows it was delivered, it's up to the buyer to take it up with the post office and eBay will side with the seller. If the item is lost in transit, then the seller generally has to cover it. The seller can try to protect themselves with shipping insurance through USPS, but it's not usually worth it. If a buyer claims the item is defective, etc., they can get a refund only after it's been delivered back to the seller.\n\n",

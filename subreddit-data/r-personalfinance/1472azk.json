    "postText": "In the past, I had to pay attention to when the due date came up because if it was on a weekend or holiday, I might have to pay at least 3 days before it's due date.  So the last Friday before the due date would be the latest day and the earliest day would be the 1st of the month.\n\nNow I have a new CC and it has the 2nd as the payment day.  So when I wanted to make a payment on another for the upcoming month, they wouldn't allow me, they said I had to wait for the new month.\n\nWhen you have to wait for a new month, and the payment date is the 2nd, what happens when the 2nd is a Sunday and you can't make the payment in the new month in person without being late.\n\nIn addition, I try to be several business days before the last business day, just in case something happens.  Now I can't do that, unless I can pay the prior month.\n\nAlso, paying online doesn't alway happen that day, so if the 2nd is a Sunday, how do I pay several days before?",

As long as you make that payment before the due date, it doesn\u2019t matter when the money finally gets withdrawn from your bank account.",

    "postText": "My husband and I are struggling financially. We live in Australia. \n\nWhen we bought this house almost 4 years ago we were both working full time and he was doing OT. When we bought the house we used the $40K I had saved and got a personal loan (GAP loan) of $30K (which in hindsight was a terrible idea but the broker recommended it to us and wanted to make it work for us). My husbands money and some of mine paid off some small debts which is why we didn\u2019t have as much for a deposit. \nSo our deposit was $70K and borrowed $631K from the bank. We bought our house for $701K and it\u2019s being looked at today but I think we\u2019d get minimum $850K for it now. \nOriginally our mortgage was $2800 a month which very doable for us plus $950 a month for the GAP loan. Since then rates have gone up over the last year and a half and now our mortgage is $4200 a month (yes you\u2019re reading that correctly), I have had 2 kids since then so I\u2019m working part time and my husband is suffering from depression (has always had it but exacerbated by stress and he\u2019s only able todo the bare minimum for the past few months which means no OT) and my husband is on medications that add up to over $300 a week/$1200 a month. We haven\u2019t been able to make our mortgage repayments for almost 6 months and it was suggested we sell our home and pay the bank back what we owe, and we should still have some left over afterwards for savings. \n\nIt seems like the only option since renting a house in our area is anywhere from $550-650 max a week ($2200-2600/ month) compared to the $1050/week we are paying now and we can\u2019t pay that. \nMy thinking is if we can pay off our debts to the mortgage, the GAP loan and we have a couple small ~$2000 debts for payment plans with dental and Afterpay. We can pay all those off and be debt free and start fresh. It\u2019s really hard to budget with bills coming out of our ears and being behind on them all. We also sold one of our cars last year to help with bills so if we could get a second car that would help me be able to work an extra shift or 2 a week since I could drive my kids to my mums and also get to my shift. \n\nMy parents don\u2019t understand what a mess we are in but said we shouldn\u2019t sell and that they can help out, which I\u2019d never accept 1. Because it\u2019s not their mess to cleanup and 2. Because it just creates more debt to payback which we aren\u2019t capable of doing. \nI do worry about judgment since my 2 siblings have their own place and are managing and my parents are very well off (all due to my dads hard work but I\u2019m in no position to make that kind of money). My parents view owning a house as a success (which it is) but I guess they view renting as a failure or not doing well. \nIt used to be not much point renting since you paid a couple hundred less a week and pay off someone else\u2019s house but at the moment we will be saving &gt;$1500/month which is a lot. \n\nWhile I write this out it seems I am doing the right thing and maybe I just fear being direct with my parents since I\u2019m used to always pleasing them and they are quite nosey asking for specifics with numbers and it\u2019s not just my business they\u2019re delving into it\u2019s my husbands which he doesn\u2019t like. But I\u2019m 31 now with a 1 and 3 year old and I feel like this is what\u2019s best for us. \n\nAnyone advice or reassurance welcome TIA",

Refinance to a longer term (or lower interest, unlikely I know) loan? If not it sounds like selling and renting is the right thing to do.\n\nAlso, it's not particularly important, but $550-650 / week is not $2200-2600/ month, it's $2383-$2816.",

Experian exposed all of our social security numbers and job history and address history among other things.\n\nIt is always good practice to use a single use card number wherever you shop, either online or in a store so you do not have to worry about the theft.  It happens, and yes, a lot.",

That's about it though...\n\nI really don't care about the protections virtual cards provide, I don't shop at shady sites to begin with. If I can't trust a vendor with my credit card info, I really shouldn't be giving them my money in the first place.",

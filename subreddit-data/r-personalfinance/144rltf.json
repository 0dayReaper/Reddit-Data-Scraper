If you really can't pay both of them off completely by the date, focus on the higher one and get it paid off in time and pay at least the minimum on the other. You'll probably have to pay somewhere between 25 and 30% interest ~~every month~~ APR (divide by 12 so its per month) for the other.\n\nMake sure to read the contracts that you sign.",

In English that means so long as you pay the full balance (not just the minimum) before Dec 2023 then you will owe no interest. But if for some reason you do *not* pay the full balance you're in for a world of hurt because now you will be back-charged interest to the time you opened the account.\n\nSo prioritize being able to pay the BB card. You don't have to pay it off now, just make sure it gets done by Dec 2023 - even if you get in a car accident and wind up in a coma until 2024.",

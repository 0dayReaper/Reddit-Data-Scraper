    "postText": "I have a $4,500 federal subsidized student loan, with an interest rate of 2.75% once the payment freeze ends. I have the money to pay off the loan in a hysa earning 4.3%.\n\nOnce the freeze ends, I\u2019m considering making minimum payments (~$50) until my savings rate decreases. Would on time payments benefit my credit score (which is already pretty strong)? Or is there some advantage to just paying off the debt ASAP?\n\nI\u2019m having a tough time understanding what these differing rates translate to in reality. I would be paying more overall on the loan by doing the minimum payments, but wouldn\u2019t I still end up \u2018ahead\u2019 thanks to the difference on my savings?\n\nI have no other debts and can afford all of my monthly expenses. I also have emergency savings that will be unaffected by the cost of paying the loan in full. This is purely about which repayment strategy benefits me the most.\n\nEDIT updated loan interest to 2.75%, auto repayment may lower that to 2.5%",

For $4500 loan amount, it's only $11/year. \n\nI don't feel it is worth it to chase the $11 gain. I'd suggest to pay it off and call it a day unless you need the 4500 cash flow buffer for whatever reason you have.",

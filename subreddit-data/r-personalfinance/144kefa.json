I put what I remembered my username to be and the password and it gave me an error so after a few more try\u2019s with different usernames and emails I quit and went to forgot username.\n\nThe username it sent me through email was the same one I was trying to use so then I went to reset password and when it told me to input my username, which was my email it said that the username didn\u2019t exist. Is this a common issue and how can I fix this?",

Someone could log into your Experian account and prevent you from freezing it, which would allow a bad actor to open accounts in your name without you being able to stop them. \n\nCalling Experian was useless. It\u2019s a major pain in the butt but gather all the documents you need to verify your identity and send them to Experian by registered mail. Be sure to keep copies and detailed notes of everything. I wish you well.",

            "comment": "We had this exact same issue you are describing happen with my partners Experian profile this past weekend. When you created your profile, did you sign up by linking your Google profile to Experian?   \n\nHe tried logging in to the app on his phone and it wouldn't let him and it kept telling him that his password was incorrect and we kept trying to reset the password but ultimately I sign into his account using his Google account instead of putting in his email address and it let us login like normal. I think they made a change on the backend and didn't announce it or it was unintentional and they just don't know it yet.   \n\nWe also have two factor authentication set up with our profiles on experian so I don't believe it was the case of potential identity theft.",

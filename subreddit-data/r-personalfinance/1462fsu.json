He doesn\u2019t need to \u201clive off\u201d the bonus as he gets paid every two weeks and for the time being has no expenses other than paying for his internet and his car insurance.  His car is paid for, an old, well maintained Volvo.  We will look into IRAs and investment accounts, as well as explore specific military programs.  Appreciate all your input!\n\nMy 18-year old will be getting a $40k signing bonus with the US Coast Guard.  He is debt free and will most likely remain so, what with the majority of his living expenses and college paid for.  He will not likely need to touch this money for a long time, so we are wondering what is the best investment / savings vehicle for him?",

He could potentially come close to max out his Roth tsp  which was over 20k last year for a year or two and really jumpstart his retirement savings. I never tell young service members to invest any significant amount through an individual brokerage account because there is an extreme lack of prudence in advice given to service members for any branch trying to invest. Oh boy if I could just record conversations I\u2019ve had with otherwise extremely good senior enlisted and officers about how stupid they are with their money and post them here this sub would have a field day.\n\nMost financial advisor positions on base are typically pretty unqualified as well, the one I\u2019ve met drives to work in a lambo despite earning just north of six figures.",

Most signing bonuses I received over 10 years were paid 50% lump sum at completion of bootcamp and training (taxed &gt;25%) and the remaining 50% split over the enlistment term (4-6 years), paid in October at new fiscal year, and taxed ~20%.\n\nSo his for his 40k\u2026he will likely get 12-15k after all training completed, and the remaining 20k will be divided by his enlistment years and paid as a \u201cbonus\u201d in October (3-4k additional deposit if 4 years).",

For an 18 year old in 2023 that amount is $6,500. It should go into any of the 3 low cost brokerages (Fidelity, Charles Schwab, or Vanguard) into a Roth IRA account that is invested into a low cost index fund (either a total stock market fund or an S&amp;P 500 index fund). \n\nHe should also set aside enough cash in an emergency fund for 3 to 6 months of expenses. \n\nChoosing a small amount (say 5-10%) to spend in a frivolous way will ensure he isn't missing out and will lessen the chances he'll end up pulling from his investments because he got a big bonus and didn't get to do anything fun with it.\n\nThe rest should go into an after tax brokerage account with the same company he opens the Roth IRA account with for simplicity. The money can grow over time and if  he needs to sell some of the investments in the future to put a down payment on a house, buy a car, or something along those lines he won't need to tap into his Roth IRA.\n\nSince he is going into the Coast Guard they will also be eligible for a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). I don't believe active duty military get a match but your kid should definitely still contribute. I would recommend either the C fund which mimics the S&amp;P 500 or the S fund which mimics the total stock market fund.",

Even better If he can contribute 15% plus get the match. In that case he would be doing fantastic. Much better than where I'm currently at. I wish I had started when I was 18.",

If it's paid lump sum and they've already taken taxes out it would make sense to put it in a Roth vs a Traditional because the taxes have already been paid so when he cashes it out in retirement he won't owe anything on it. Since the contribution limit for traditional and Roth IRAs for an 18 year old is the same putting it in a Roth also means that he's effectively contributing more to it since $6,500 post tax &gt; $6,500 pretax in future value since he'll no longer have to worry about any future tax implications for the IRA.\n\nSince we don't know all the information and the parent is asking for advice I think the Roth in this situation is a better bet based on the limited information at hand.",

The only thing that really matters for Roth vs Traditional is whether they\u2019d expect to earn more or less in retirement. Almost everyone earns less.

The other index funds are extremely low cost as well.)\n\nI also found a 5.15% CD through Fidelity recently, and put $4k into that. Since he won't need this money soon, I'd recommend finding a good CD and maybe putting at least 20k into a multi-year fund (I don't think I'd go higher than 2-3 years at the start though.) Fidelity's CD selection is very comprehensive.\n\nI don't know much about it, but I think military has a TSP retirement plan. He would want to start investing in that right off as well. Get this money invested early so it has a long time to compound over the years, and he'll be very happy that he did in 30+ years.",

I would recommend maxing out his Roth IRA and putting as much as he can in TSP (military version of 401k).  Assuming he's activity duty, he doesn't really need to pay for much and can live off the $40k.  By the time it has run out, he should be E-3 or E-4 and can max out TSP pretty easily.

Their loans rates for mortgages and car loans are tough to beat. I wouldn't invest anything long term with them though because the rates they pay on checking and savings aren't very high. It's fine for checking and smaller amounts in savings for day to day expenses and bill paying, etc. but for long term money he should want it invested in low cost index funds which he can get through Fidelity, Charles Schwab, or Vanguard.",

I'm joking about your kid obviously and I'm exaggerating but sadly that's pretty close to what actually happens with kids signing up. I can't tell you how many people I knew in the service that made 2200 every month and had 800 dollar monthly car loans and thought it was okay because they didn't have any other bills but still ended up broke before pay day.\n\nHonestly the best advice you can probably give him is to never listen to his buddies. Although I was in the Army and the Coast Gaurd is supposed to be smarter on average.",

Just make sure he does at least 5% for the full match, and make sure he doesn\u2019t put it in the G fund.",

You won't lose that account, the money will stay there.\n\nThat said, whenever you get a new job, if they have a 401k with a different provider, you can roll it over then. They probably have a hotline you can call and they'll tell you what you need to do for free. That's easy assets under management for them, so they'll make it as easy as possible for you.",

Then you contact the company holding the 401k currently and initiate the rollover with that info.\n\nIt may sounds stressfull but I can say the recieving companies arealmost always helpful when rolling roll old 401k/Roth401ks into an IRA/RothIRA. They want your money invested with them.\n\nOnce the money has been transfer, be sure to invest the money in your choice of mutual funds, ETFs, stocks, bonds,etc. Once nice thing about having the IRA/RothIRA with a brokerage company is that you are not confined to the few select funds that you had in your 401k and will have access to the full breadth of mutual funds, ETF, stocks, bonds, etc.",

A couple of things with that:\n\n1) You \\*must\\* keep your former employer up to date on your address and check in occasionally.\n\n2) Administrative fees are allowed to come from accounts.  I've seen plenty of employers charge a monthly or annual fee for terminated employee accounts.  You do have to be notified first (make sure your fee disclosure doesn't say it already), but keep in mind that's a possibility.",

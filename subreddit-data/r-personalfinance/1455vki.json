    "postText": "Hi all. So some relatives of mine recently got handed a 2018 Honda Accord with \\~20,000 miles for free due to unforeseen circumstance. Their intent for this vehicle was to give to their daughter but due to some recent reckless driving habits they feel she doesn't deserve the vehicle. I have been approached from these relatives asking if I would be willing to trade my vehicle (2013 Honda Accord w/ \\~110,000 miles) plus the difference in value for this car.\n\nDue to some major wedding expenses coming up I would need to finance a majority of the difference (\\~$10,000), which with some quick back of the envelope math would put me at a \\~$200/month payment. This is well within my budget but my main concern is that I won't be getting enough value out of the newer car to make this transaction beneficial for me. By the time I finish paying the car off it would be 10 years old with likely over 100,000 miles on it. I'd love to hear some thoughts and input on the matter. Thank you!",

I paid off my car in 2010, 2.5 years after buying it, then just kept putting the $530 each month into a separate investment accounts, so that was my car fund. Student loan payments paused? Put that into another account. Small stuff like video games/computers/TVs I just put $20/item/month into a separate checking account -every few years when it's time to upgrade, I already know my budget and don't have to think about it.",

Did you happen to want a newer car? If this relative hadn't offered to sell you the car, would you be looking for a newer car right now?",

Maybe see if your relatives would be willing to negotiate on the price and look at getting a more affordable vehicle with whatever funds remain.",

    "postText": "My boss was an asshole that made his secretary cry daily and yelled at me to my face most days of the week. I realized this was not acceptable and told my boss I found a new job and I started the week after and this would be my last week at his business. He had a hissy fit and told me to pack my belongings and leave right then and there. I'm wondering if I can file for unemployment in Massachusetts because it seems like he fired me instead of me quitting even though he may file the paperwork as I quit. I'm wondering what I can do in this predicament?\n\nLet me clear up that I don't have a new job set up, I only told my boss this to get out of this job as I did not want to witness his reaction to me telling him the real reason I needed to leave.",

As others have said, absolutely file for unemployment - you have nothing to lose as they will simply deny you if they deem you unfit to receive assistance. Given the facts you've laid out however, I believe this would be appropriate grounds for receiving those benefits as you were told by your employer that they no longer wanted you to work there. That is a termination as far as I am aware. Sorry you went through all that too.",

It was a small local business and they relied on me heavily (IT) so I didn't want to screw them over when I was moving out of state so I gave them a 2 month notice. Gives them time to find someone, transition, and gives me time to find a new job. A few weeks in he calls me into his office and goes \"I found someone, you can go now\". I'm kind of in shock, like I gave you 2 months notice to help YOU out, i expected you to honor that (dumb) and I had not secured a new job. You are essentially screwing me over for helping you. I am going to file unemployment since you are firing me. He insisted he wasn't firing me since I had given notice. Then, like the total asshole he was, he goes on speakerphone with the unemployment office right then with me sitting there and asks them to tell me I cannot file. The poor lady on the phone goes \"Uhm, no, he gave notice, you are letting him go prior to that, you are firing him. He will easily be approved for unemployment and this call makes your case against him significantly worse\".\n\nWhat a dick. I collected unemployment of course until I found a new job (which only took 3-4 weeks).",

Even as an at will employee there are still rules. They can't fire you because you're disabled for example, and mine included language requiring written notice if you're leaving.  That may not have any legal weight but it would give you grounds to argue you did not officially resign.  There can also be things like employee handbooks which may be considered implied contracts.  What i would say is i did not resign, not officially anyway.  If the boss disputes it I would explain that I discussed with him that I was planning on quitting but never submitted the required paperwork.  What you're suggesting is the boss should be rewarded for not getting it in writing, which doesn't seem fair either.  Ultimately the unemployment agency would make the decision, I have reasonable grounds to argue i did not officially quit.\n\nFyi, there's no judge involved unless there's a lawsuit.

This protects employers from employee misconduct after their resignation. So on that front, the situation is that you resigned; you were not fired.\n\nHowever, you can still file for unemployment. I'm an employer, and most employees who leave our company file for unemployment whether they were terminated or resigned. \n\nThe State where they worked (we have employees all over the country) sends us a questionnaire with questions related to their employment and termination. We answer the questions honestly based on the information we have, and the State decides whether unemployment benefits are granted.\n\nWhen you file for unemployment, you will fill out a similar questionnaire. You'll need your paycheck stubs to do this, btw. They'll ask you about your dates of employment, how much you made, hours per week, etc.\n\nIf the information between the two questionnaires is in conflict, the State will sometimes come back with a request for documentation. We provide what they've asked for. Employees may get similar requests, but I've never been through the dispute resolution process from their end. I would recommend you take some notes about the sequence of events so you have it ready.\n\nI will tell you that typically, when an employee has offered their resignation, the State denies benefits. While I have had MA based employees, we've never had an employee resign while in MA. Our only MA employee moved to NY before resigning and taking another job.",

Unemployment boards have found that even if the employee laid the groundwork to end the employment relationship, the employer\u2019s subsequent action of actually firing the employee superseded the employee\u2019s actions. It depends on the state as each run their UI separately, but in many situations if you have a two week notice and were then were walked out, you\u2019d be eligible for two weeks of unemployment. Beyond that notice period, no, as the employee gave notice of their intention to end their employment.\n\nThis is precisely why many companies will pay out the notice period even if they opt to not have you work those days. It\u2019s often preferable to pay out the time than have a claim against their unemployment insurance which would raise their rates.",

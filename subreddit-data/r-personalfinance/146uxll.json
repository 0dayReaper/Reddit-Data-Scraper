Do I need both of these?\"\n\nThere's just not enough data provided.\n\nIt's quite likely that you should just drop the non-Term life policy (almost universally trash products) and maintain the Term Life policy.\n\nBut let's start with this:\n\n* Do you have a need for life insurance?\n* Is there anyone who would have a *financially* very difficult life because your income is no longer available if you died?",

This person can shop multiple companies at once.  State Farm agents can only shop one company (their own company).\n\nPick the one that provides the coverage you need for the length of time you want at the cheapest price.",

The lack of depth in the question makes me think it's probably not part of a plan, so odds are this whole life could be got rid of, if its replaced with saving/investing the money you would have continued to spend on it.",

Of course it\u2019s true it gets more expensive, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need it. \n\nSorry to hear about your mental health. I\u2019m not an expert on this but I would recommend talking to a proper financial advisor who is paid by hour not on commission and get it straighten out.\n\nI personally doubt the whole life is appropriate for you, unless you have strong reason to think your mental healthy is a risk to your own life, in which case please seek medical assistance, therapy or whatever you can afford or may help. Health is more important than wealth.",

Reddit and finance advice is very down on whole life insurance, but realistically it is better than nothing, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s usually worse than alternatives for the same amount of money. There are insurance salespeople who take advantage of people by selling these type of policies, so it gets people up in arms.\n\nThe people here saying categorically your insurance is a rip off do not have enough info to make that call. They don\u2019t even know how much you\u2019re paying! So def worth getting proper advice!\n\nYou\u2019re doing great looking after yourself and your kid, get some advice and keep at it!",

Then you have children and want another policy that aligns with them getting through college. You can continue stacking policies as your needs change through life.   \n  \nBut you haven't identified a reason for needing a whole life policy. There are only a few niche places where a whole life policy makes sense. It's better to get a term policy for the \"term\" you need coverage and invest the savings. Seriously, whole life policies are bad expensive products, consider getting another term policy for whatever you're trying to cover and cancel your whole life policy.",

And you probably only need it if someone depends on your income to live - a spouse, children, older family you take care of, etc. Life insurance is meant to replace your lost income if you should die. So get a term that will take you through your earning years. \n\nSo if you're married, and your spouse depends on your income, and you are 35, get a 30 year term. That will take you to retirement age. When you retire, you won't have income anyway. You will be living on social security, retirement savings, and/or pensions. Your spouse will get all of that when you die, so they will still get the same money they would if you were alive. \n\nIf no on depends on your income, then you don't need life insurance. I will add, though, that everyone should have a will. If you are in a position where you don't need life insurance, the will should be relatively simple and inexpensive to draw up.",

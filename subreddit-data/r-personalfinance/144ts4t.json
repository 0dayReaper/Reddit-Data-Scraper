    "postText": "I am 19 currently taking a gap year from college and working full time. I don't get paid hourly, I get paid monthly, $3,500 a month. This number is only recently though, it was previously only $2,900 a month. I currently only have a little over $6,000 saved up; I realized maybe a little too late that I need to manage my spending before I use up all that I've saved and my gap year goes to waste. However, I am pretty much financially illiterate. Being from an immigrant family, my parents never taught me anything about finance and my education system didn't teach much either. I have been doing some research here and there on my free time, although, I would just really like advice from people who are financially experienced. \n\nI signed up for Robinhood last week and put $200 in the stock market and split that into the following funds: VTI, VWO, VEA, BND, VNQ, SPY, VT, VOO, QQQ, and a few individual stocks like Tesla, Netflix, and NVidia. \n\nI've also been reading up on high yield savings accounts and CDs, although I'm not sure which would be best for me. From what I understand so far with CDs, you deposit an initial fund and you can't access it nor add to it until it matures, so in my case I feel like a high yield account would be better. I found 2  options so far: SoFi savings account with 4.2% APY and CIT Bank platinum savings with 4.85% APY. But with CIT platinum, you only get the 4.85% if you have over $5,000 deposited (which is possible for me), otherwise it's only 0.25% if below $5,000; you also need a $100 minimum for CIT. \n\nI'm really just unsure if I'm on the right track with my money, and what to do with it. If any of you have advice to offer on stocks and investments, and which bank to put my savings into, it would all be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",

We're halfway through the year - so let's say you end up with 12-15k at the end of your gap year. \n\nI would:\n\nTake 2-3k and put it in a Roth IRA. This is your investment money. At your age, any amount in there is great. \n\nBookmark about $1k for fun money next year. You can keep that in a separate account or not, but remember to let yourself have fun next year. \n\nPut the rest in a high yield savings. This is your school money and emergency fund. Never touch your emergency money unless it's an emergency. This should be 3-6 months expenses (I don't know yours, but I'd like to see 5k at least)- like if you get evicted or expelled from school, you would want that money to let you figure it out. \n\nAnything over that emergency amount, you can use next year at college for needs (food, books, school fees, rent).",

My plan is actually to just attend community college and transfer after 2 years to save up as much as possible. \n\nWhich brokerage should I open a Roth IRA with? Or does it not matter? Do you have any investment recommendations? \n\nAnd between the two option for high yield savings accounts I mentioned in the post, which would you say is better? \n\nAgain, thank you for your advice :)",

Wiki and Prime Directive give you a sensible roadmap. \n\nWe offer opinions, not advice.  \n\nIMO, a HYSA without a minimum, sofi or Ally.com, along with a CD.  Go to ally\u2019s website and learn the real rules on CDs and early redemption.  Get your emergency fund started. \n\nIMO, robinhood is a mistake.  A RothIRA for earned income after you have read the wiki, with just VTI as you learn.",

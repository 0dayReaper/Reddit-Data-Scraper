    "postText": "Somewhat newbie question about the 4% retirement withdrawal rule that is supposed to last 30+ years. I\u2019m very aware it\u2019s simply a source of guidance and that real life is more complex, but does this calculation include the assumption of money (invested funds) continuing to grow at some kind of annual percentage like 7%? If yes, wouldn\u2019t you never run out of money if the account output is less than its growth? What am I missing? Thanks in advance for sharing your wisdom!",

But I\u2019ve experienced. +30% years and -40% years. 4% comes from the Trinity Study done by economists in the 1990s that found a 60/40 portfolio would last 30 years starting with a 4% withdrawal when compared to every recorded prior 30 year period. It doesn\u2019t guarantee the money will last forever. And past market returns are of course not a guarantee of what the next 50 years market will do.",

                            "comment": "It's not just about a shift to conservative investments, people often misunderstand the \"7% average return\" of the stock market, thinking it means the market tends to rise ~7% every year when that is very far from the truth. In reality the market swings wildly from year to year with extremely high returns being tempered by years with 0 returns or negative returns, the market almost never returns between 5-10% in any given year. Because of this it's hard to gauge how much you should be pulling out, if the market has hard negative years in the first few years of retirement it could lead to you running out of money even if the market then continues to rally and maintains a 7% per year average over your retirement. This is called sequence of returns risk. Two people could retire with same amount of money and have the same average return over their retirement period, but if person A has big losses early on and person B doesn't, person A could go bankrupt while person B could see their retirement savings grow far faster than their spending. The 4% withdrawal rate is intended to mitigate that risk, but it's still not a great rule.\n\nSince 1928 there have been 6 years in which S&amp;P500 has returned between 5-10%, there have been 25 years where it returned &gt;20%, and there have been 6 years where it had a &gt;20% loss.",

There are several problems with this, including the fact that many people may not be using the 60/40 portfolio, may be retired for far longer than 30 years, and the back tested period happens to be one of the best stock market periods in human history. I've seen new papers giving new safe withdrawal rates anywhere from 2.5% to 6%. In reality you're far better off adjusting your income year to year based on portfolio performance than following a hard withdrawal percentage",

After 30 years youd be witdrawing like the equivalent of 12% a year.\n\nIf you believe 4% is all you need then in theory at retirement you should dump it all into a 30 year bond and lay back knowing your 4% is guaranteed...right?",

The 4% was a calculation based on 95% chance of success which is quite high and therefore fairly conservative, but also what most financial advisors aim towards as they are conservative by nature. There was another study where a 6% withdrawal rate gave around 80% chance of success. It all depends on risk tolerance and they are obviously just hard and fast rules based on historic returns and inflation. You could have a couple of years of high inflation and low returns and it would screw it up hugely, so it's wise to build in a lot of risk.",

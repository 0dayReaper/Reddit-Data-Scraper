You might get shortchanged a buck or so. Or you could spent several hours of your time to save fifty cents.\n\nThis is not worth spending much time on.",

Most airport currency exchanges would give you a worse rate than the banks.\n\nSInce your total value is small (~150USD) - don't waste time worrying about \"loss\" or timing the sale.\n\nUS Bank also appears to have similar options but they call out a $10 per transaction fee in addition. As far as I can make out, BoA doesn't have such fees; but check before you transact",

Based on those numbers you gave, I'm going to assume that the 10% loss is evenly split between the two transactions so I would lose \\~5%, so it would be worth it to do at Bank of America. But like you said, it's really not a big deal so I'll get to it when I get to it.",

My accounts have gone from 10.24% and 11.24% to 16.99% in the last few years despite fantastic credit. Every year they bump it up a few percent and send a postcard with your accounts are lower than the lowest rates we currently offer, if you don't accept you agree to cancel your account. No amount of bargaining will change their mind and the 5% rewards are too good to cancel and I'm not carrying a balance anyways.",

            "comment": "Former employee at a major credit card company here. Sometimes when you call, you might get a trainee. They wont tell you that, but the thing is and what some people dont know is that people who work at call centers have their phone calls timed. The goal is to take care of the card member as efficiently as possible and in a timely manner, so as to get the next card member on the line. There are some employees who will do almost anything just to get the card member off the phone in order to keep their average call times down, trust me they dont want to keep you on the phone as it is. With that being said, you might actually luck out and come across a new employee or just someone who doesnt give a damn and will give you what you want even if you might not even be qualified for it. Im not sayin i ever did anything like that, oh goodness no. Bottom line, it definitely cant hurt to ask!!",

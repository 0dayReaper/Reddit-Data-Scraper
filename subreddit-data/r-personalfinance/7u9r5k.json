    "postText": "Three months ago I was laid off as part of a 60 person lay off in a small company of 125 people.  I do Occupational Health and Safety work as I was the Manager.   I was given unemployment; been searching for jobs.\n\nFast forward 3 months, tax bill passed, etc.  I get a phone call from the president of the company asking me to come in because he has an opportunity.  He tells me things are picking back up and the company needs me back but he's trying to shop me at a discounted rate.\n\nI had been with the company 6 years and he says he wants to give me 20 hours at 60% of what I was making to do consulting work for 4 months until my lease is up.  This seems like a super low ball offer especially because they don't have to train anyone, I already know all of the employees, I am familiar with their policies as I wrote many of them.  Also after 4 months I cant get back on unemployment and having taken such a drastic pay cut I wouldn't be very well equipped to ask for more money in the future.\n\nI feel like this is a slap in the face and I want to counter offer their 60% slap with a 125% slap back.\n\nDoes this seem unreasonable??  Just seeking some guidance. \n\nThanks yall!\n\nUpdate: I weighed in at 250%.  Haven't received any response it's been a couple of hours since I sent my proposal.  I had to run the numbers several times.  My head hurt.\n\n**Update:  It's been a week and haven't received a response. ",

But you need to think on this here... the fact that they're groveling back to you, means they are desperate too.\n\nThey just realized that they made a mistake, that you were an important employee. Don't let them get the better deal out of their own mistake. They now know you're valuable, and you need to act like it.\n\nRealize that this is a very perilous and risky situation for you too, to go back to a company that has already fired you. Proper compensation shows they respect that and you. If they don't, it's not a good idea to go back to them, because you're going to find yourself in a worse position than now. \n\nOne thing on going back as an employee: Imagine how getting fired twice from the same position and company is going to look on your resume. As a consultant, on your resume you look good. Because it shows they needed you. So 15% pay increase? No, that needs to be higher as well.",

You tell them the max that doesn't make them move on to someone else. If you give them the option of a minimum then that is the starting point. If you ever mention a range they will automatically only look at the lower number. Never negotiate in good faith, always hold back because they assume they have all the power and will not take you seriously.",

If you have a lot of experience and there is a range for how much your type of position usually pays, then you ask for something near the top of that. I would say that you need to do research online and search around to other advertised openings to see what others are offering in your area. Always ask for more than you think you are worth and depending on how firm you are and how much you \"shoot for the moon\" you hint at the fact that you are negotiable. I like to say \"I think $X would be fair.\" It doesn't say that you require it but doesn't obviously say you are willing to accept less.",

If you think you\u2019re going to accept an offer from them, you may want to look into creating an LLC or a Subchapter S corporation, and have the contract be between your former employer and the entity, rather than you as an individual. The reason for this is that these entities shield you from liability in the event things go sideways and you find yourself on the losing side of a lawsuit. If you contract with them personally, and lose, they can go after your personal assets, e.g. your house, car, savings, etc. If the contract is with the entity, barring limited circumstances, the only assets they can go after, are ones that belong to the entity; your personal stuff is off the table. They\u2019re not expensive to set up. There are important differences between an LLC and an S Corp, so talk to a lawyer first before making a decision, should you chose to go this route. ",

What about work injury insurance? Also, you need to factor in the fact that those hours makes it harder for you to find another job for the other 20hours of the week. As stated on another comment, your rate should be 2x your hourly rate of your original pay. And then multiply it by at least 25-30hours per week, not the 20hours a week that they want you for. And then multiple it by the weeks of the contract duration. This also sets you up for a higher pay if they decide to rehire you. Your old boss needs to factor in the part that there isn't any training involved. You're basically going in working at 100% capacity. All the more reason for more pay. If he's reaching back out to you, it seems like he's desperate, just don't make it seem like you're in desperate need of a job or else they will just counter offer with something else unreasonable.

More importantly you should never hit the end of the contract hours and have that be your first notice that the job isn't done. If your consultant is encountering difficulties, you should be hearing about that within a day or so of the problem. There are a million reasons why a project might run a bit long, and a good consultant will generally make good on small discrepancies like that, but communication is key. If things are taking longer than expected, you should know why, and you should know soon. If you're blowing up the budget because you can't make up your mind or you're expanding the original scope, your consultant should point that out to you, and they should do it before all the money is gone.\n\nNot to exonerate all consultants, but in my experience clients are terrible at estimating their own projects, and I would never sign a contract based on a client's estimate alone. Remember that when you're hiring a consultant, you're hiring their expertise and experience as much as their labor (that's the difference between a consultant and a contractor, generally speaking, and it sounds as though OP's former boss wants to bring them back as a contractor, not a consultant). Clients generally underestimate the complexity of a job, overestimate their own efficiency, and completely ignore all the implicit work they expect to get along with the explicitly specified project.\n\nThen they just flat fuck around and waste my time because they didn't even stop to think that the people from their side that I need to work with are tied up in a big product launch, on vacation, or ducking me because they think I'm here to replace them. I'm a nice guy and I like to play golf, so when I hit a delay that was going to eat an afternoon, or found out that the sysadmin I need to see regularly shows up at noon I'd turn the clock off and go hit the course. If the weather sucked though, I was willing to sit in your conference room and reddit until Captain Pissypants is confident that he's shown me who's boss and manages to show up to work, and the clock runs the whole time (although I will point it out in the weekly status email that I send the client, which they sometimes even bothered to read...)",

As a consultant at my current work, I make 2x my previous salary, I am on a yearly contract, I don't get OT, but I also bill for my time so if I work 10 hours, I bill for 10 hours. If I stay late, I get paid to stay late. If the company provides a lunch that forces me to stay on site and not leave for a typical lunch, I charge for lunch unless it's not required.\n\nIf they require I work onsite, I charge from the time I leave the house depending on my current agreement.\n\nIf I need to work offsite, everything is charged including my lunch time from the time I leave to the time I return.\n\nConsulting is a good gig if you are disciplined enough to stick with the BS that comes with it and the BS clients will try and throw at you. Some clients piss and moan about travel time... a lot. If you don't want to pay for travel, don't pay for it. You come to me. Travel time is time I could be with other clients and not sitting in my car.\n\nIf I am on a trip and I go out with clients to dinner, this is also considered work.\n\nWhen you consult and you are good at what you do - you get paid for it. It's 100 x better than any salary gig where they essentially have you working an indentured servitude contract.",

You may have to look at getting public liability insurance (very cheap).\n\nOnce in the door, carve out a niche for yourself; use your knowledge of process to make yourself a single point of failure. Work hard, enjoy the cash rolling in, it'll take them ages to get a replacement for you - they may even offer you a permanent position, in which case you can decline and carry on contracting elsewhere, or accept at a massively increased salary from your original FTE amount.\n\nSource: Am procurement professional, deal with contractors and professional services on a daily basis",

I was lucky to find an editor (not one of the major mills) who charges a reasonable price for both me and the customer that matches my skills. We can't compete with the paper editing mills (like AJE) which undercut everything and chase the bottom dollar, or Fiver, which is garbage, but it's nice side money. I only end up doing 1-2 big papers a month, which is nice extra income, but you can't survive on it.\n\nMy favorite customers are Saudi, because they usually don't care how much something costs. They want a Ph.D. thesis edited, and don't care it's going to cost $1000+. And their english is so terrible I get to rewrite it properly and charge them more for that service. Meanwhile, chinese authors want to pay you .00001 cents a word and don't want to pay and bitch about everything.",

Nothing is permanent/owned/committed to by companies and all the risk is covered by the consumer.  Car leases were the early exemplar of this idea as well.  Sure, if you're a power user you get awesome regular upgrades at less cost... but if you're an infrequent or light user, you often pay more than you would have previously because you'd skip every other or every 2-3 versions of the software (Adobe Creative Suite, I'm looking at you) or phones (I keep my iPhones 3 years, usually so it makes more sense to buy but even there \u2013 we've been talked into paying $50-$100 per line (so, often $200-$400 for a family) for phones + data and upgrading phones every 1-3 years vs. having a telephone on your wall that lasted decades.  Yes, we get more functionality out of it but it is also becoming an expectation/basic necessity for functioning in the modern world so it means that it's part of the base cost of life.  All told, it feels like everything's getting more expensive (beyond inflation) but I haven't seen any sort of rigorous study of this idea.\n\n",

They did, fired me again after 6 months saying I was too expensive.\n\nSo I went to ALL their competitors, straight down the line, and when they rehired my firm when I was 25, they were paying us $120 an hour and I was farming out employees to them.\n\nAs far as I know, my old company (I sold it to a young partner 2 years ago) still consults with them, and I wouldn't be surprised if they charge $250-$300 per hour.

With an employee you may have additional taxes, benefits, liabilities, insurance obligations. With a contractor, you typically pay more, but get to skip all that. \n\nSuppose you're a small company without a really well developed HR department or a great safety record in a sector that fluctuates a lot. You may determine that rather than support a larger HR team or pay higher premiums for an entire year when you only need the extra help for three months, it makes more sense to just hire a contractor to fill in when needed. No benefits, have them carry their own insurance, issue them a 1099-k and get rid of them as soon as the contract is up. Easy-peasy, and in plenty of instances the total cost is a lot cheaper.",

During that time they don\u2019t pay payroll taxes or benefits. The vendor as an S-Corp is responsible for those. If the s Corp just has to pay taxes on that $40, so the \u201cemployee\u201d (now s-Corp owner) doesn\u2019t really see all of wages. At the end of the term the contract can expire and the company knows exactly how much it costs them and can budget again for next quarter without the recurring expense being required. The \u201cemployee\u201d is no longer an employee so they can\u2019t collect unemployment.\n\nGiven the need to pay taxes and the risk in losing benefits going from $12.5 employee to $15 contractor is a bad for the employee though many people miss this and wind up in a bad spot. At a shift from $12.50 hourly as an employee to $40 hourly as a contractor this is likely a good deal, especially as other commenters notes if the new s Corp can use this as a jumping off point to other engagements at that rate.

The IRS has [some helpful info](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-self-employed-or-employee) -- typically if you have no autonomy about when to work, how to work, what tools to use, and how you'll be paid, then you should be a w2 employee, NOT a 1099 contractor.\n\nBusinesses misclassify employees as contractors for 2 primary reasons. First is to shift the tax liability -- that's why the IRS has this info and some forms to help sort out who owes what. The second is to try to screw you out of hours/benefits -- this is a type of wage theft handled at the state level through your Dept of Labor, although you'll be more likely to recover lost income if you can hire a lawyer or get a big group of misclassified employees to make the case.\n\nSome people find that they can command such a high salary by \"consulting\" that they are ok being misclassified. OP might become one of them, since he's getting good advice about countering the offer with a *much higher* number. But if anyone out there is feeling like something isn't right about being a 1099 contractor, check out what the IRS and your state DoL have to say about it.",

            "comment": "You're not being offered 60%.\n\nIf it's consulting work you're not getting the full price on your employment anyway.  The fringe - benefits, insurance, 401K, health insurance, etc... - that goes with a full-time employee usually works out to 75%+ of the salary, sometimes as high as 100%.  So an offer of 60% hourly rate consulting works out to 35% of what you used to cost the company.  That's why people charge 1.5x-2x their salary for consulting.\n\n**And then on top of that** they're only offering you half the hours!  So forget 35%: Now they're basically offering you 17.5% of you old salary to work half the hours but will likely still expect you to cover 80-100% of your old job.\n\nThis isn't a slap in the face.  It's a knee to the groin, followed by pulling your hair.\n\nMy advice to you is copy the second &amp; third paragraphs of this post, (rewriting it to change the prepositions where appropriate: \"he\" becomes \"you\", etc...) and paste them into your response to the president of the company.  Then counter with something you deem appropriate.  I'd say 125% of your old salary, full time, or 175% with their part time hours.  Be respectful, don't insult them, but make clear you're not interested in working at 17.5% your old wages.  Sure it's hard to afford to pay people like full-time employees.  You know what's harder?  Paying rent without a job.",

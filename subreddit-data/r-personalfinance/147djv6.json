    "postText": "So I'm only 24, and messed up my credit when I was younger (Shortly after 18 I think) by many late payments to Aarons (Like Rent-a-Center), and then reaching double the 150$ limit of my first credit card, and it going to collections. I paid it off, and about 2 years ago got a Capital One Platinum card with a 300$ limit. Since then Ive mostly bin maxed out, but never really over the limit, and recently started getting better footing financially, as well as learning how to save money. Before a few days ago I didn't really know a lot about how credit, or credit cards worked.  Countless hours of videos later I've bin trying to figure out the most effective way to use half the salary of my primary job (9k a year is half, 18k whole) to build credit to help me in the future, as well as reach my goal of getting the Capital One Quicksilver for the cash back, and a limit increase.\n\nTL;DR: I fnucked up my credit.\n\nSo I want to know if using my card for all every day expenses and recurring payments, then paying the balance owed every week when I get paid would be the most effective way to build credit with a 300$ limit, on average 120$ of spending on the card a week, and only really 175$ max to work with each week. I'd be paying roughly 175 until my balance is even (currently owe 240 still) then putting the remainder in a saving account. If this isn't an optimal way to use the card, or build credit, then could someone help me figure out a method that would work?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAppreciate any tips, and help, through side work I've bin doing, and a minor raise on the (not quite full time) job I work I've finally started feeling like I'm getting some footing financially, and would love to make the most of what I have right now to prepare better for the future.",

            "comment": "If you use your credit card correctly, it\u2019s very similar to your electricity bill. You accrue charges through the month just like you use electricity through the month. Once a month your utility/CC send you a bill for the charges since the previous statement. You have a couple weeks to pay that bill. That repeats again next month.\n\nIf you don\u2019t use your credit card correctly, it gets a whole lot more complicated.\n\nYou use a credit card correctly by always, every single month, no gaps, pay at least your statement balance by your statement due date.  There is really no benefit to paying more frequently than once per month. You can do it, but it can make it more difficult to keep track of your spending.",

Like assuming so long as my utilization by the end of a statement cycle is low, does it affect me negatively or positively if the total amount I've spent/paid them is over the 300$ limit the card has in that month? Or does it not really affect anything if I spend and pay them more per month?",

That should in no way satisfy your needs at 24 and creditors look at debt to income ratio as well. So in other words let\u2019s say your credit score is 500 right now, with 9k per year, I bet if you doubled your salary by getting a 2 year degree or a vocational degree you\u2019d be making at least 18 or 20k per year and your credit score would probably be up to 650 or 700 by the time you graduate and enter this new job",

                    "comment": "I meant 9k is half the income (18k) of the main job I work which is only up to 30 hours a week. I also do side work making 20$ an hour and over (250$ for changing a hot water tank in 3 hours last weekend was nice). I only have so much guaranteed money in a week though. Plus the low credit limit of 300$ doesn't really help, as I don't want the utilization to be too high at any point.\n\nSo I just wanted to know with around at least 175$ (half of my weekly pay for said 30 or less hours) to use a week towards my goal of building credit off of a 300$ card, trying to use about 100-120 a week, paying it off when I get paid, and repeating the process every week would help, or if there's a more effective way for me to work towards building credit with what I have now.\n\nSide note, why would a 9 year carpenter, waste money on a community college? The main place I get my work might be a dead-end, but the skillset gained from it sure isn't. (Ftr yes I started working full time and doing online schooling as a teenager) \n\nEdit: The above is a joke, I guess you'd be right if I was really only making 9k a year lmao",

If your credit is low and you double your income it will go up is all I\u2019m saying, and with a still somewhat low income at 20k you should still be able to double it in a trade like carpentry easily. Maybe even quadruple it by the time you are 30. That whole time if you are paying all your bills on time and using credit wisely AND have a greater income your score will definitely go way up from where it is now.",

            "comment": "&gt; the most effective way to build credit with a 300$ limit,\n\nIf you really want to build credit - DON'T use the card too much. Pay with cash or debit card for most of your purchases; put maybe one or two small transactions (a meal at fast food? Some basic groceries). \n\nPay down your card as fast as possible; aim to have a balance of not more than $50 at most each statement.\n\nThen - pay off the statement in full each month.\n\nOver a few months, you should see an improvement in your credit score. You MAY be able to get an increase in your credit limit; or removal of the secured deposit; or even get approval for a card with a higher limit.\n\nBuilding credit is about showing that you can use it responsibly; that means paying on time (and in full, so that you don't pay interest); using it only as required (not spending all the time because you have the card); getting more and different types of credit with sufficient time between applications (at least 6 months to a year between any additions), and keeping them in good shape for a longer period of time.",

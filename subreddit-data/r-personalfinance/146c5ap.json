    "postText": "I currently work as an accountant in my early 20s and over the course of several years, my family and I have managed to save up close to 50k where we feel comfortable with investing. Currently this amount sits in different checking accounts, high yield savings accounts, CDs and some cash. I know that leaving cash in the bank is the worst thing to do, but I also don't know what to invest in. This amount nowdays seems too little to invest in real estate, so how can I grow this money? Whether it's a business venture or an investment of some sort, I do not want to keep letting the money linger like this. I've always heard of compounding interest as the way to go, but is there a specific investment that does this? Just feel lost and any help would be appreciated",

The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle. This book was written for beginner investors emphasizing investing in broad market ETFs like VTI or VOO for their simplicity. Just set it and forget it even during market corrections until you retire. Broad market ETFs for the win.",

We just did more of the same...mostly.\n\nOnce we had our house and we were contributing the federal max to the 401k, We'd invest extra into taxable investments -- into the same sorts of mutual funds we used in the 401k.  \n\nAnother option is to supplement your 401k with IRAs.  Both you and your spouse can open one, even if Spousie doesn't have an income of their own.  (Benefit of being married)\n\nNote we started investing into a taxable investment account a long time ago...  Before the Roth was invented.\n\nMake sure you have enough in cash to cover emergencies as well as near-term spending goals -- say less than 5 years. everything else should go into investments in some form.",

However, I do have financials accounts open at Vanguard, TD Ameritrade, &amp; Schwab.

For a broad US stock index, the popular ones are all 0.1% or lower (0.1% means every year you pay $1 per $1000). The annual fees will most always be dwarfed by the gains.  \n  \nJust get an S&amp;P 500 fund (mutual or ETF) or a US Total Market fund (mutual or ETF). You can play around with international as well. Or, Vanguard has an ETF called VT which is a global fund (60% US &amp; 40% International).",

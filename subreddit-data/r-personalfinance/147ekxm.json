    "postText": "Hey everyone! I wanted to share our recent experience and seek some advice from this amazing community. Our family of five recently sold our house and relocated across the country due to military obligations. With the surge in mortgage interest rates, we decided to move on base at our new assignment. We managed to make a decent profit of around $90k after clearing all our debts, except for one vehicle. Our current financial situation includes $10k in savings and our military TSP/retirement fund. Now, we're looking for guidance on how to responsibly store and grow our money for our future goals.\n\nOur goals are as follows:\n\n1. Purchase a family house within the next 12-24 months, assuming interest rates drop.\n\n2. Build an emergency fund that covers three months' worth of expenses ($21k).\n\n3. Potentially invest in additional properties to create a real estate portfolio for passive income.\n\nRegarding our decision to move on base, it essentially means renting from a government-approved housing contractor using the $2k housing allowance we receive. This explains why we're exploring alternative ways to manage our finances.\n\nI've already looked into CDs and HYSAs as potential options, but I'm eager to hear from the community and gather any additional advice you may have. Thank you all in advance for your insights and suggestions!",

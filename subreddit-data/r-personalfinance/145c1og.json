    "postText": "I got promoted in my day job again. No weekends, no holidays, no evenings, no night shift. The pay was $20.50 plus all my normal benefits, was actually like a 5% promotional raise. We work from home mostly, or some of us do a hybrid schedule. \n\nI finally meet the other people in my role in the department yesterday at a work function. They are all roughly my age and all they did was complain that they were broke, they couldn't afford rent but won't buy a house, and talked about them not having work life balance. Then continued to complain about how they haven't be promoted to the next step yet.\n\nThen I caught them being really clicky and only talking to each other. wtf.\n\nObviously, I do a hybrid at work schedule. I own my house &amp; I go to the gym &amp; have a side business to keep myself balanced. \n\nFirst question, is my salary good? Is it likely that we all make the same amount? My employer is relatively large and not known for giving high wages. But known for a really great benefits packages, which they do have.\n\nSecond, I don't like discussing my wages. But won't turn down a conversation about home owning, business owing, or stocks, etc. Multiple sources of income is my goal. How do I better handle these conversations in the future?\n\nShould I take these conversations as a warning sign that the department doesn't like to promote? They do have a decent amount of turn over BUT no more then my last department. I was promoted in the first year of being there because everyone quit. \n\nthanks for your insights.",

            "comment": "&gt; First question, is my salary good? \n\nCompared to what? Mine? Your parents'?  The only question of value is whether you could be earning more at a different job or a different position.\n\n&gt; Is it likely that we all make the same amount? \n\nMaybe. Maybe not.  Why does it matter?\n\n&gt;  How do I better handle these conversations in the future?\n\nNot clear on what the problem is with the way you're handling them now.  Honesty is a good policy, even if complainers don't like to hear it, or hear someone who has more than them.\n\n&gt; Should I take these conversations as a warning sign that the department doesn't like to promote? \n\nNot necessarily. People who are generally unhappy and complain may not be the first in line for promotions.  Consider steering clear of their negativity.",

Also, when I was promoted in the first year at my old job, some people were really mad about getting passed over because 'they had been there longer'\n\n3. okay just thought I might need to do something different.\n\n4. okay good, in my last department there were people who HATED the job. And other staff was really mean to use because no one in the department dod there job. lolol I should have taken that as a warning because no one did anymore andddd I turned into one of those people who hated the job. I pay attention to the work environment and toxicity level.",

What they make doesn't matter. What they think of what you make matters even less.\n\n&gt; Also, when I was promoted in the first year at my old job, some people were really mad about getting passed over because 'they had been there longer'\n\nSure. That happens. That's a **them** problem, though, not a **you** problem.",

All that matters is what you make, and if you can make more somewhere else, or work harder to get promoted or switch fields, then do that.\n2. don't have them. they don't help you in any way.\n3. again, who cares? all that matters is if \\*you\\* can get promoted. The rule I had was to \"always be looking\", whether looking upward in the same company, or keeping an eye on the job market in my field, or other fields. You do \\*you\\*, not anyone else. All that matters is that you are meeting your bills and savings/investment/personal goals. Worrying about whether the grass is greener, or someone else is making more hay, will only lead to unhappiness.",

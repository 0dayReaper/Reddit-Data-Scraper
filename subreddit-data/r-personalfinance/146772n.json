    "postText": "My mom has come into bad health, preventing her to work like she used to. She has roughly 19 years and 150,000 left on her mortgage. \n\nOption 1: She sells and gets 350k from the home paying off her mortgage. Moving in with my sibling. She hates this option.\n\nOption 2: I buy her house, and she continues to live there until the end of her days. She is almost at retirement age. She loves this option.\n\nI have some sizable school loan debt around 100k. But I also make 170k annually. Her mortgage is 1200 a month. This seems doable to me. And possibly a good investment for 20 years down the road.\n\nDo I?\nGet a new mortgage and buy her home for what she has left.\nMake a trust where the title changes to me and I make payments.\nOr is there a better option I don't see?\n\nThanks for any input, I'm very new to these types of finance decisions.",

Their assets have to be limited, though. She couldn\u2019t just bank the equity from the house. She has to live off the proceeds.\n\nSounds what you and mom need is a consultation with a financial expert in aging and estate planning. Your senior center or Agency on Aging can help you find someone.",

Which means that when you go to sell it your capital gajns exposure is higher. Say she paid 200k for it. It is worth 500k. So when you sell it later and it is work 700k, then your capital gain is:\n\n700 - 200 = 500.\n\nLess the exemption:\n\n500 - 250 = 250\n\nYou capital gains tax on 250k. $50,000 in tax. Expensive gift.\n\nWhereas if she gives the house to you in her will, your cost basis is what the house is worth.\n\nAs for:\n\n&gt; I would be buying it for 150k, below fair market value. \n\nSo you are getting a gift of 350k. Fine no tax. But I do not know what your cost basis would be. https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/down-payment-gifts-tax/ has some interesting things to say.\n\nAnother approach is to pay her full market value for the house. She then gifts you 350K cash. You then recast the 500k mortgage down to 150k by paying 350k toward principal, and thus will pay off 150K over 30 years. \n\nYou should be able to get the title company and lender to do this seamlessly so that you do not have to worry about her keeping her 350k. You might need the help of  real estate attorney.\n\nSimplest would be a transfer on death deed. You then pay the existing mortgage payments. The down side is that if she changes her mind, she can remove the transfer of death provision. So worse case you are out some number of years of mortgage and property tax payments. Same as rent. \n\n&gt; There is some stuff like gift tax that goes over my head.\n\nA gift over 17k (maybe it is more in 2023) has to be reported on a separate tax form filed separately from a tax return. Gift taxes will not be due because her estate is too small.",

If you\u2019re in the US, depending on your state, you may qualify for unemployment for what would have been your notice period (so potentially two weeks in your case), but also some states\u2019 unemployment programs have a waiting period of one or two weeks before any benefits take effect - meaning that you may receive no or only one week of unemployment benefits.",

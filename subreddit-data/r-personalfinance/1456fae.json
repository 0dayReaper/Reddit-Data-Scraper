    "postText": "My wife and I recently came into a little bit of money and we are going to use it to pay off our credit cards in full. \n\nIs it possible to negotiate the total down since we\u2019re paying it off in full? Will this hurt my credit? Is this a stupid question?\n\nI know the obvious answer is pay off your debt asap, I just want to make sure we are going about it in the best way possible.",

Settling debt is not something a CC company will entertain unless you are not making minimum payments and they believe you're unlikely to ever pay the debt. It'll also likely involve them closing your account and damage your credit.\n\nCC companies simply have no incentive to voluntarily take less money, unless they feel it is their *only* option to get any money at all. At that point they simply send the bill to collections rather than bother negotiating, but in some circumstances you can intervene before they do this.",

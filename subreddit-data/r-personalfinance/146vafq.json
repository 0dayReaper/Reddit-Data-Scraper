    "postText": "Hi all! \nI have a question about the loan on my house from 2018 and separate loan on my solar panels that I got installed in 2023. \n\nI'm in the initial period on the solar panels that has lower interest for 18 months and where I will receive the solar tax credit. \n\nGenerally speaking, does it make more sense to try and aggressively pay off the panels in the next years or make the basic payment on the panels and put the extra money toward more aggressive principle on the house or split the difference?",

We don't know the size or the system or generation credits they may receive. The 13k would generate returns too to help pay for the system.

My neighbor paid 8K to have them removed and reinstalled for a new roof 12 years after they where installed. His insurance costs are higher. Someone has to clean the panels to get maximum benefits. There is lots of hidden costs your not factoring and they add years to the payoff. Funny you imply I'm the one being nearsighted...lol.",

But taking your example of 8k after 12 years. Again, if I leveraged some one else's money and financed the panels. Then depending on the numbers you could have not paid any cost to the loan, paid it back in 5-8 years and saved more than 8k in the next 2 years.\n\nInsurance rates would be dependent on the risk of damage to the panels in your locale. My insurance did not increase. It's also not necessary to clean the panels as they typically get blown clean or washed clean when it rains. So unless you get something on there that doesn't wash off easy then you won't need to clean it.\n\nBut based on your reponses,  I doubt that you care about any of the positives of solar. There are definitely situations where it's not good but your original statement was premature and lacked the information to reach the conclusion of bad investment.",

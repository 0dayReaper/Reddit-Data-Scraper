    "postText": "Edit: I do NOT think this is a good idea. I was trying to figure out why someone MIGHT think it is, if I was missing something. Surprise- I am not wrong, it is indeed a bad idea and not something I was or am considering pursuing. Thanks everyone.\n\nOriginal:\n\nHad a family member suggest I default (let it get repo\u2019d) on a loan (Travel Trailer) to \u201cget out of a bad situation\u201d. They tried to tell me it wasn\u2019t a bad idea since I wouldn\u2019t be looking to buy a house or use my credit score for anything anytime soon, and the loan is only in my name and not my hubbies.\n\nThey also mentioned going back to the dealership, explaining my health issue, and coming up with a deal with them if they\u2019re open to it (they take it back/buy it for less than I owe, and a payment plan for x-amount of time).\n\nAll of those ideas make me sick to my stomach. While we don\u2019t LIKE that we\u2019re paying for it, we can afford it/can manage it barely. Are EITHER of those ideas a good idea in any sense? I\u2019ve never even made a late payment on something. 800+ credit score.\n\nBackground- I purchased the travel trailer with the intent to personally use it and rent it out. Half a year later I got extremely sick and diagnosed with a chronic illness, and so the trailer is not being used at all. Its sitting and will cost us $300/mo for the next 6 years, excluding any storage, transporting, and basic maintenance costs.",

A loan agreement obligating you to repay the amount you borrowed. \n\nThe asset is used as \u201csecurity\u201d for the loan. This means the lender can take possession of the asset and sell it to recover cash to satisfy the loan agreement in the event the borrower defaults. \n\nThe thing is, if they don\u2019t recoup enough money to satisfy the loan repayment, the borrower is still on the hook for the balance. They can also bill you for the trouble they had to go through. \n\nBanks have entire departments full of people whose job os recovering debts. They\u2019ll drain your bank account. I\u2019d that doesn\u2019t do it. They\u2019ll garnish your paycheck. \n\nRepossession is not a get out of jail free pass, unfortunately.",

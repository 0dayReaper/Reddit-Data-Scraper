    "postText": "So I\u2019ll keep it short. I have $7K in federal student loans. Two loans that are $3.5k each at 3.4% interest. I doubt that the student loan forgiveness is going to go through with how the Supreme Court has been deciding things so I\u2019m just trying to get ready for when I have to start making payments. My question is I have the $7K saved up. Should I just pay it if off in one payment? Or should I just do the minimum payments until it\u2019s paid off? And put the $7k in a Roth IRA or something? I do have  emergency fund of $10k in a high yield savings account. My only other debt is my car that has an interest rate of 1.9%. Any advice would be appreciated.",

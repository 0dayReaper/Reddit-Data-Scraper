    "postText": "So I've been considering a move outside the US in a couple years and today I did some research and discovered something that might be obvious to most folks, but had so far eluded me. Credit is specific to the country that you're in. In other words, if I move to say Canada my U.S. credit doesn't translate. It doesn't go away - I still owe the debts, but it has no impact on my Canadian credit, which would basically be at a zero.  \nSo, if that's the case - why don't people with bad credit go online, get a PO Box or something equivelent in other countries and use that as an address to establish credit there? If you're planning to move to another country, wouldn't it be adventageous to start your credit building as far in advance as possible? Maybe even use it to pay off some of your U.S. debts so you're not carrying that with you once you move?",

    "postText": "I'm currently facing a difficult situation with a significant amount of debt. Coming from a background of poverty, I wanted to help my family achieve financial freedom. Initially, I took on a large loan to support them, but over the years, I found myself trapped in a cycle of borrowing more to repay existing debts. Somehow, I managed to survive, but there were moments when I was on the verge of breaking down. Fortunately, a friend came to my aid and helped me get back on track. However, I realized that I needed to take decisive action to break free from this pattern and support my family.\r  \n\r  \nI found a job that paid well, more than my family had ever seen. With the newfound income, I started fulfilling their needs and desires. However, this led to additional credit card debt. Moreover, the place we currently live in is uninhabitable and unsafe, which worries me, especially as my parents approach retirement. I wanted to provide them with a secure and comfortable environment, so I decided to purchase another house. Unfortunately, due to certain circumstances, I am unable to sell our current properties.\r  \n\r  \nNow, I find myself in a situation where my debts are equal to or even greater than my salary, and I don't see any other viable options to overcome this challenge. I feel like I might have made a mistake, and I'm unsure of what steps to take next. It seems like finding a higher-paying job is my only hope, but I'm uncertain if that will be possible. I'm feeling lost and in need of guidance. Can you provide any advice on what I should do in this situation?",

Not even if they\u2019re your family.\n\nAt this point your debt is draining your finances and making you less able to provide. That is why debt is bad. Without any details, it\u2019s hard to give any specifics of what you should do. At some point, the load is enough to consider bankruptcy. Maybe you can earn your way out and pay it down, but with no information we can only blindly guess.\n\nSo far, any increase in income sounds like it has become increased spending for family. You have to stop until you are out of debt. If you are your parents\u2019 retirement plan, you need a blank slate to support them. Right now you are a second yacht for bank executives because of interest.",

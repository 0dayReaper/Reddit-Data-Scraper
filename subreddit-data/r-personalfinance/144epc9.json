    "postText": "I\u2019m in a dilemma. I was contacted last year by a recruiter for a position. I interviewed with everyone needed and they were about to offer me the position when upper management wanted to hold off because of the looming recession. \n\nFast forward a year later, I had been in communication with the lady who would have been my manager. They have posted the position again and are hiring. She is retiring next week. \n\nI recently left my job where I was making $60k for a job that is paying $82.5k. I have not started the new position. The stalled job was paying over $100k. \n\nOther things to consider, my old job was 15mins away from my home. The new job with no traffic is about 30 mins. The stalled position is 8 mins away, which I could drive or bike for the same amount of time. \n\nWould it be wrong to start the new job in hopes of getting the higher paying job.",

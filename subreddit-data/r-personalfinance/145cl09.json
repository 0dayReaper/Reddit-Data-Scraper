    "postText": "I received an alert on my credit report of a new inquiry from Chase credit cards. Shortly after I received an email from Chase thanking me for applying for a credit card and my application would be reviewed. Only problem is I didn't apply. \n\nI called Chase immediately and spoke with their fraud department. They confirmed they will mark the application as fraud and send me a fraud toolkit. Then I called experian, transunion, and equifax and froze my credit reports and placed a fraud alert. I also reported it to the FTC but since they weren't able to open the account their wasn't much to do there. Finally I reviewed my cbr and other than the inquiry everything looked normal. \n\nSo I'm just wondering if I've missed anything or if there are any other steps I need to take? I was going to change my email password but I don't actually have a password on it, I can only sign in with an account key on my phone. Any advice or other steps I should take?",

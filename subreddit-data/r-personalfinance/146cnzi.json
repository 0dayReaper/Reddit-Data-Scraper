    "postText": "Hey \n\nSome background: recently relocated to US through work, so had 0 (current score 629) Credit Score when I arrived, got a car loan through my bank at 8.9% APR, Total at 22k USD. \n\nSome Credit Card usage. \n\nWanting to buy a house in the short term. \n\nEmployed fulltime. Work in pre-sales, so *potential* to get some bonuses quarterly. \n\nIs it worth to pay off the car loan in order to build up credit, or simply pay the minimum/slightly above and save up the money for a house? \n\nI rather have less expenses if it's possible, but if it helps to have the car loan to build credit going forward, perhaps keep some of it? \n\nAppreciate any advice!",

            "comment": "The car loan is just one data point on your credit report, that will eventually be paid and closed.\n\nYou want to build credit and add accounts that can stay open long term -- credit cards.\n\nWait until you have the car loan 7 months then apply for a basic card like Discover It. Keep it simple just spend $5 a month and pay in full. Then in a few months you can repeat and get a 2nd card.\n\nIf your goal is to buy a house you want to save up at least 5% for closing costs and/or down payment. However the car loan could impact your debt to income ratio, worst case save up as much cash as possible and run the numbers with mortgage broker. Actually you could game the credit score this way since paying off the loan usually lowers your scores you could apply for mortgage and be in process and then pay off loan for DTI purpose and get best of both worlds.\n\nAlso rule of thumb for a mortgage is to have 3 lines of credit.",

    "postText": "Just wondering if anyone here only started to really set themselves up financially at the age of 31.\n\nI\u2019m 31. With about 10k in savings with no debts and currently saving weekly. Around $1000 per week. \n\nI have no shares or other investments. I own my $50k car which I paid off this year.\n\nWould have had more in savings though used my weekly income and paid off car loan.\n\n\nFeel like I\u2019m behind a little bit. But hey everyone lives different lives and I never compare myself. Just be nice to hear other people\u2019s situations and if they started when they were 31.\n\nNote: I really enjoyed my 20s. Travelled the world and defiantly had some good times. \n\nCheers :)",

If you're really saving 52K/year with no liabilities, you'll do a lot better than most people who saved earlier in life. \n\nWhich, btw, you're 31. Not 50. You've got plenty of time to amass wealth.",

This doesn\u2019t include dental or vision. \n\n Buying our own insurance is even more expensive. So I guess our options are either no insurance or expensive employee sponsored insurance. The best part is he works in healthcare. \n\nDoes anyone know of any secret health insurance options or tricks?!? \n\n* We make around $110,000 this year.\nWe are in NC.",

Yes, you could pay the $100k bill in 5 years, but what if you have 2 more $100k emergencies in that time? Or a $1M emergency?\n\nI know these scenarios are ludicrous, but they aren't implausible in the US. I agree that alternatives need to be explored, but you or I are not going to solve US healthcare here on reddit, unless you happen to be the president or a member of congress.\n\nI know $2k is a high number, but there are people who pay that for family plans in the US. And the families who can and do pay that (however unwillingly) are making enough ($100-200k+ annually) that they can't just declare bankruptcy at every emergency, because they make too much for Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 payments would be just as prohibitively expensive and you can't file for bankruptcy every year.\n\nAll I'm trying to say is that paying cash is great for routine/preventative care, but not emergency care. Emergency care is what insurance is really for. You don't want to get cancer and be a cash patient, because if you don't have the cash upfront, you won't get the care you want/need.",

ACA made it a requirement for all employers to hold a plan for all eligible employees, which was a 30hr per week average at an affordable cost. This program single-handedly set in motion health and insurance costs exponentially rising since 2010 because insurance companies know you employers have to use them and no longer negotiate with hospitals, hospitals increased their prices due govt supplementation, and employers lost all power to compete for their employees in the marketplace. \n\nI work in HR. ACA f*cked everyone except mass corporations and govt  employees. \n\nHealthcare.gov offers independent plans that are even worse than insurance companies and more expensive.",

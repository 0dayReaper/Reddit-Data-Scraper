    "postText": "I have $30k remaining in student loans with a 3.23% interest rate and am currently paying $2k towards this debt monthly. \n\nMy husband and I are relocating with our 7 month old daughter and dog to the Boston area this summer. We would like to buy a home in the next couple of years but will rent first upon moving. The twist here is that he resigned from his toxic and stressful job making $170k a year to allow us to move. We have $350k in savings (plus separate 401Ks) and I currently make $160k annually.\n\nMy question is - should we use some savings to eliminate my debt and free up that extra $2k a month or should I continue paying monthly? Or how should I go about determining which is the better way to go?",

We\u2019d be fine with just my income for a bit and would be able to recoup the $30k fairly quickly I think, and definitely agree it might be worth saving on the interest.",

After deductions you may only be paying half of the interest you think you are paying. It\u2019s worth while to figure out what goes to principal vs interest.",

Depending on their deductions, if OP\u2019s husband has left the workforce entirely, their income might just be below the threshold where they can claim the deduction. Once the husband gets any sort of paying job, that will bump their income above that threshold, disallowing the deduction.",

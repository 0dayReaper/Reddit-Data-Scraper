    "postText": "Hey guys, this is probably an odd question for this sub, but I searched and couldn't find an answer anywhere. I've been getting my tax refund the old-fashioned way for years: paper check in the mail. I never had a problem until this year, when someone stole my 2022 tax refund check out of the mail, forged my signature, endorsed it to themself, and cashed/deposited it somewhere. It was a not-insignificant amount of money for a student, too.\n\nI waited weeks until I could report it missing, then I waited a few more weeks to be sent a copy of the forged check with a claim form. I mailed it back immediately with tracking, waited two weeks for it to be picked up from a PO box, and now I'm presumably waiting for them to process my claim.\n\n**Do you guys know how long that part of the process takes? Any experiences with it?** I was really hoping to put it into my student loans as soon as I got it.\n\nLesson learned and heed my warning fellow check-lovers. **Switch to direct deposit for your refunds.** Avoid the headache. I'm really hoping that they accept my claim because the forged signature was similar (not the same) to my actual signature.",

I'm sorry to just spit that out there but I've worked with IRS ef ups for decades as an accountant, it's taken between 12-18 months to get most issues dealt with. This involves a banking issue as well, so that is probably going to complicate it further. \n\nI still haven't gotten one of our refunds from 2020 returns due to some hold up nobody can explain \ud83d\ude2c",

Even our CPA drills that into our heads when we're like \"Can you call the IRS about it?\" \"We could but you're gonna pay us a lot for that...and no faster response really than it grinding its way through the system.\" D: D: D: D:",

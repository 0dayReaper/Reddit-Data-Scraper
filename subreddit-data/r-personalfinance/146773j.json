            "comment": "You cannot transfer holdings from a taxable account to a 401k, period, whether it\u2019s a pretax, after-tax, or Roth 401k. You can only contribute through payroll deduction. Some plans then allow for within-plan conversion from after-tax to Roth status, which is what a mega backdoor roth conversion is. Some of those plans also offer in-service withdrawals which let you selectively roll funds from the Roth 401k to a Roth IRA, although this part isn\u2019t strictly necessary to get the benefit.",

If so, you can't just move them into your Traditional 401k or Roth 401k, then roll that out into a Roth IRA.  \n\nIf you could do that, then all these rich people would move their highly appreciated stock (up to the limit), and use this as a loophole to avoid taxes.",

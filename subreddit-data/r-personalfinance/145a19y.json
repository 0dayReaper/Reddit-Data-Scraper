    "postText": "TLDR; Credit card issuer determined I am \\*not\\* the victim of fraud and I am liable to pay back $4,000 of charges I didn't make. What should I be preparing for in my appeal? I am in a bizarre situation of needing to prove my innocence, with my credit score and $4,000 on the line!\n\nI was the victim of identity theft and CC theft. One of my credit cards was stolen (cloned?) and used at a restaurant. That credit card was immediately closed down and a new one was issued. I am not liable to pay for those charges.\n\nThen, somebody opened a store credit card at Best Buy and racked up nearly $4,000 worth of purchases over a 3 day period. \n\nCoincidentally, since I have a Best Buy account I began getting sales receipts emailed to me. I also received a credit alert almost immediately. Here's what I did next:\n\n1) I immediately called the Best Buy Credit Card. They flagged the charges as fraudulent and marked the credit application as fraudulent and closed the account.\n\n2) I went to [IdentityTheft.gov](https://IdentityTheft.gov) and followed the steps. I now have a fraud alert currently on my credit report.\n\n3) I called my local police and filed a police report. The officer wasn't that engaged but did take my information and my story and took hardcopy printouts of the receipts that were emailed to me. He mentioned that \"maybe they could pull camera footage\". No idea if they did.\n\nBest buy sent me a letter saying they have determined that the credit application was NOT fraud and that I, in fact, made the purchases. I called the credit card and spoke to a person who read the results of their investigation: The address of the credit card application matches MY address and the purchases were made in my home city. Therefore, it is determined that I applied for the credit card and made the purchases. The cased is marked as closed.\n\nThe Credit Card Rep took the police report number and re-opened the case. Assuming the police report won't contain any information beyond what I already gave, does that actually carry any more weight? Is there anything else I should be doing. I am in a bizarre situation of needing to prove my innocence, with my credit score and $4,000 on the line!",

See official credit report from www.annualcreditreport.com for address. Do not trust credit monitoring sites.\n\nSince they are giving hard time mail it with tracking (does not need certified or signature do whatever is cheapest that gives you tracking #)\n\nBut this \"hard time\" could be due to not sending copy of police report. Not a number, not a statement that you filed it. Actual copy of police report. Anyone can say my police report number is 2023-12346.",

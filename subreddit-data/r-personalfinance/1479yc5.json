    "postText": "I just graduated college in May and my plan since I had been enrolled was to aggressively invest and save as soon as I started my full-time post-grad job (late July). I\u2019ll be working in a metropolitan city and staying with my aunt where I\u2019ll be commuting about two hours a day (an hour there and back). She\u2019s allowing me to stay but basically said it being long-term isn\u2019t an option. She knows I\u2019m able to afford an apartment by myself and am not \u201cstruggling,\u201d which is why she says I don\u2019t need to stay for very long since I'd only be staying with her to save. She is also a private person who likes her \u201cme time\u201d and I completely understand this as I\u2019m the same way but it\u2019s worrying me a bit. I would like excess in this world. Have so much money I don't know what to do with (at some point in the future) and really understand how it feels to be financially free and advance past \"average.\" I don't want to spend money on rent. I've had an unconventional upbringing and had to pay my way through school from expensive city rent to weekly groceries and car mishaps, you name it (had academic scholarships for tuition) -- this is finally the chance I have to get ahead and it seems like it'll be short-lived.\n\nIs there anything you all would suggest I can say to convince my aunt to let me stay longer? She seems very adamant about it and even said she's a big fan of mine because if it was anyone else in the family the answer to asking to stay with her would be a hard \"no.\" Are there any other options, whether I can live in my car for a while (did it for a summer in high school) or just anything else you can think of?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFYI - I get this is a bit extreme, but I want to do the best I can to set myself up and get ahead, ask any questions you need. Please suggest anything you can think of from common shelters in the Texas area to the longest I could potentially go living in my car lol. ANYTHING",

    "postText": "hi, im 19f and a college student currently. this is my first time posting. I have a couple hundred over 1k in savings and I would like to know if that's good as an emergency fund.\n\nhere are the facts:\n\n1. I currently have no debts\n2. I go to uni on a full ride so I pay only for things like transportation to and from school.\n3. I relatively recently got part time jobs when at home and at school, which depending on how much I work, nets me anywhere from 1200 to 1800 per month.\n4. half of my paychecks go towards savings. I don't really have any bills besides two subscriptions as I live either at home or school\n5. I usually don't spend much; the biggest expenses go towards transportation and my hair care\n6. I have a student credit card (discover) but I have no begun using it yet.\n7. I have nothing for retirement or investment currently but plan to in the future\n\ncan I start trying to build credit? am I in a good situation currently for investing and trying to save for retirement? or should I add a little more to my emergency fund first (im thinking 2k)?",

You can use it occasionally to buy something you have the money to pay for and always pay the statement balance by the due date.\n\nIf you have the ability to save some of your income into a Roth IRA, that's super. Right now your primary focus is school, it's ok to not be aggressively investing/saving for retirement, but getting started early is excellent.\n\nSince your expenses are low, your emergency fund can be small, but having a little more in that fund is reasonable too.",

            "comment": "You\u2019re doing great to be thinking about this now!\n\nYour most important investment right now is your education. Graduating college is the single most reliable way to increase your lifetime earnings. If your job(s) becomes too much to handle along with school, realize that long term your college degree will bring you more retirement savings than your current income. Obviously life can get in the way and necessitate decreasing course load in favor of more money now, but average salary for someone age 25-34 with a bachelors degree is nearly $60,000 vs only $44,000 with an associates degree vs only $40,000 with some college and no degree (where you currently are).\n\nThat said, not all studies and majors are created equal when it comes to financial opportunities and stability after graduation. STEM fields tend to pay significantly more than humanities or communications: https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/average-salary-college-graduates/\n\nMoney is certainly not everything, as being burned out will cost far more in the long run than doing what you love successfully and happily. Just don\u2019t discount the lifelong opportunities that come with higher expected salaries.\n\nThe other comments have good advice. Regarding the emergency fund specifically, generally recommend 3-6 months of expenses, which you didn\u2019t list here. Would keep saving until you get that amount.\n\nRemember to avoid carrying any balance on your credit card, paying it off in full every month. You build credit by keeping the credit card open for a longer period of time (length of credit history), not by spending more.",

When rent becomes part of your expenses you'll want to see if you can increase your emergency savings to ~2-3 months worth of expenses to cover any unexpected transitions.\n\nA 50% savings rate is really rigorous too. Probably more than you need, but if you enjoy the lifestyle your remaining 50% affords, there's no harm in building up a good savings cushion. You can decrease your general savings rate in favor of \"saving for\" (car, trip, event, first month's rent etc) which is a great way to start teaching yourself budgeting and plan to afford the things you want.",

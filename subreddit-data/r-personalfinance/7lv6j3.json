    "postText": "With tax season fast approaching I wanted to make everyone aware of a little-known fact that if you make less than $64,000 a year you are [eligible for free tax filing and preparation](https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free). \n\nThe government has a contract with tax prep companies like H&amp;R Block that allows for free tax filing for 70% of Americans. You can use the tax prep software that companies normally charge for without paying a penny if you go through the IRS's website. The program opens in January to file your 2017 tax returns.\n\nThe IRS's advertising budget for this program is $0 so very few people realize it exists. Last year only 2% of eligible taxpayers used this system. Most people paid the companies to prepare their taxes because they weren't aware of this great program. It is literally the same programs the companies charge for being offered for free. \n\n*If you're interested in why companies would offer their products for free it's because it prevents the government from offering a free filing option. So long as tax companies offer free filing to 70% of US taxpayers the government will not offer a competing tax prep option, per the contract. They just work very hard to make sure no one actually knows the free filing option exists so we continue to pay them to prepare our taxes.* \n\n**Use this program and please tell everyone you know so they can take advantage of it too.**",

TurboTax and taxact agreed, credit karma was off somewhere, but I was able to use those others as a reference to find the problem and get them to match, then filled for free with creditkarma. So yeah you'll want to check it against something more established but it worked. I would tell anybody to do that when doing their taxes regardless of the method you ultimately use to file. It's free to fill out TurboTax, it only costs to file with them.",

Mine all matched the first time.  I have a feeling/am hoping that CreditKarma has worked out some of the kinks over the past year to make their program better.  \n\nI'll use them as long as they produce a decent product purely because they're not as entrenched with the ridiculousness of lobbying against a government free filing option like the other companies are.  (They of course still profit from the status quo, so they're not perfect, but yadayada \"choose what wolf to feed\" yadayada)",

It\u2019s part of the same program, but with a higher income threshold than VITA offerings, probably because there is no volunteer to help you. I believe the VITA threshold this year is $54,000, and the software has a threshold of $66,000 (verifying numbers for the 2017 tax season is hard today for some reason, but I think those are right)",

They explain everything really well and if there\u2019s something you still don\u2019t understand, there\u2019s another link right there with more info. When I bought my house a few years back, I started filing online myself and then got nervous thinking maybe I missed something. I finished filing, saw how much my refund was going to be, but never actually hit \u201csubmit\u201d at the end. Instead, I took them to an actual tax professional, paid $100, and they came out with the exact same number at the end. I felt so cheated.

They work with banks and employers to data match everything so even as someone with a business and investment portfolio, it took me about 15 minutes to do my taxes. Without the added complexity of multiple tax entities, maybe would have been done in 2 minutes.",

Apparently Turbotax, H&amp;R, Intuit, and most of the major tax companies lobby to keep it complicated. I've been using TaxAct because they don't use my money against me. Highly recommended, it's easy to use and cheaper than the others if you earn above the free threshold.",

He also refused to consider applying for a supervisor position, which he would have been good at and essentially did this work anyway, because of the \"complications\" a higher income would bring.\n\nAnother person I know has a fairly meager yearly salary, no house, no investments, etc.  He pays money to 'his tax guy' to file his return every year.

(I don't think it's *quite* to 1040EZ level, but not much beyond that.) And if you go to the main websites of these, that's the only free options you'll find.\n\nWhere *this* link largely comes into play is that there's an alternative option to filing free returns with the bigger players that you *don't see* if you go to their websites -- you have to go through the IRS's Free File links. This opens the door to many more people, who have more *complicated* returns but are still low-ish income. If you fall into this bank of people, it's useful to know that these bigger players do offer free filing if you just go at it the right way.\n\nThe other nice thing it does is collect up a list of a bunch of different tax prep options together.",

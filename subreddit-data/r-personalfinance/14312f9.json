    "postText": "Hi, so last year I had set up a recurring donation for a charity via TotalGiving since they no longer were able to go through VirginGiving. Unfortunately I lost that credit card it was set up with so I set up a recurring payment with a different card, and to my surprise, later that month I still got charged on the original payment method along with the new recurring payment I had set up.\n\nSo I\u2019m donating twice as much as I\u2019d like to and thought I\u2019d get one recurring charge cancelled.\n\nI\u2019ve reached out to TotalGiving multiple times in the past few months, their \u201cContact Us\u201d section of the website has an online form, Facebook, or Twitter option. I reached out multiple times via online form, and nothing. They are inactive on both Facebook and Twitter, no responses on either.\n\nI reached out to Chase and they said they couldn\u2019t stop the merchant from making a recurring charge. I even tried the \u201cLock\u201d functionality and they said that only stops physical charges, not recurring charges. I asked if I could get an entirely new card number and they said that the recurring charge would still occur. The Chase rep said the only thing they can do is dispute the charges on my behalf but I really don\u2019t want to have to do a new dispute every month.\n\nI reached out to the Charity directly and even they said TotalGiving has terrible customer service, they never received a response from TotalGiving on other issues.\n\nI\u2019m out of ideas, what more can I do?\n\nEDIT: It\u2019s charging to a Chase credit card and not a bank account",

The merchant pays that fee even if they win the dispute.\n\nSo as a last resort, do the charge back, and after a few months it should get their attention.",

When I downgraded it to a Freedom, the number changed.\n\nMost of my bills recurring charges went through the following months and never had to be updated.  Except for my car insurance, which is every 6 months.\n\nI'd just assumed that would bill to the new card too.  I never worried about paying the bill on-time because it always autopaid with no trouble at all.  To be honest, I forgot it was even on that card in the first place.\n\nI didn't even know I was due for renewal until I got a letter from MA RMV saying my registration would be suspended the next business-day (I wasn't checking my mail often, it came in on a Tuesday but I didn't check it until Friday evening) because our cars were uninsured (and had been, apparently, for 3 weeks at that point), and I'd have to pay $200 per car to reinstate it if they didn't receive proof insurance by Monday.\n\nQueue calling my insurance company as soon as they open on Saturday...and then calling the RMV first thing on Monday.  After 2hrs on hold, the RMV said it was already suspended and they hadn't received the update from the insurance yet.  A lot of back and forth with the insurance company and RMV but I was able to get it fixed without paying an extra fee per car.",

For example, Progressive sends me multiple letters and E-mails leading up to the due date. Check your mail more often.\n\nAlso, don't assume things went well when it's something that if you don't pay, you can get into actual trouble. You should be checking on your insurance every renewal anyway to make sure they didn't hike your rate unreasonably.",

I've contacted my state AG on a three different occassions where a business was acting illegally or in bad faith. They have a form you fill out online and then they investigate with the business directly. Enough of those complaints and said business is looking at fines or other punitive charges. I guarantee you the company will get shit straightened out in short order after a call from the AG\n\n&gt;I've been using chase for around 20 years\n\nok so I should disregard all the shitty things they've done because one rando off the internet has never had an issue? lmao, ok cool story bro\n\n&gt;Don't be so quick to assume malicious intent when simple incompetence or unknown factors are the answer ninety nine times out of a hundred.\n\nThis is Chase, the bank that hit it's customers with 1.5 billion in overdraft fees when COVID hit and people were struggling due to not being able to work etc. that's about as cold hearted and malicious as they come. Fuck your shitty bank",

There are plenty of companies with \"great\" BBB grades that frequently are rated as terrible by third parties whose revenue isn't from the companies that they're evaluating. i.e. BBB says the issue was \"resolved\" but they give their paid members a pretty wide berth to declare an issue resolved and cause no hit to their grade. Meanwhile many small businesses that actually are fair and honest to customers that refuse to pay to play can't get top grades.\n\nThis is why BBB is frequently called old people Yelp because that's essentially what it is.",

You could start posting on Facebook and Twitter about their shady practices and sending them screen shots of the posts, maybe that might get a response...\n\nEDIT: Ok so either way whether it\u2019s a Middleman or the actual charity the impact of exposure is the same. I\u2019d probably do this an cancel the credit card account entirely.",

Anyways; I\u2019ve seen people say cancel but maybe you could downgrade or upgrade your card to a different one within the Chase family? That would stop it since it\u2019s a completely different card without you actually having to close out the credit card? Hope you find a solution, good luck",

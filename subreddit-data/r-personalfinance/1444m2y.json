    "postText": "Basically as the headline says\u2026my parked car was hit by another car in my office\u2019s parking garage. \n\nThe driver and myself both have the same insurance, Geico. And the driver left a note on my windshield admitting to the damage, and there were also witnesses in the parking attendant and manager.\n\nAnyway, I contact Geico and the insurance agent assured me that this would fall under property damage since I wasn\u2019t even in the vehicle. This is important because at some point, my collision deductible changed from $500 to $1000 by mistake and I never got around to changing it (I work overnight, life\u2019s been stressful ugh). \n\nI was told repeatedly, that I would not have to pay a deductible because this falls under property damage. I also looked up Geico\u2019s property damage coverage and it includes damage to vehicles.\n\nBut when I looked at the updated status of my claim, it **now says my claim is considered a \u201cnot-at-fault collision.\u201d And that I must pay $1,000 deductible before Geico pays out the rest of the damage.**\n\nI am of course livid because this is absolutely, 100% different than what I was repeatedly told yesterday. And to my best guess, since both me and the other driver are both Geico holders, Geico is looking to cut its losses, but sticking me with the $1,000 collision deductible so it doesn\u2019t have to pay out as much, as it would if it\u2019s filed as property damage. \n\nThat to me seems unethical, but what may be an unethical loophole, may be legal. I don\u2019t have any family members who can help advise me with this, and I\u2019ve never been in such an ordeal. \n\nCan someone please give me some advice on what to do here? Is this allowed, fair? Can I fight this? Thoughts?\n\n**Edit** Wow. I was not expecting this sort of response. First of all, thank you guys for being so understanding and taking the time to offer me advice. \n\nTurns out there are a lot of insurance adjusters in this sub and you all have pretty much said the same thing, that this seems to be more of an error on the app.\n\n**To clarify, some of you asked why did I file a claim under my policy? I didn\u2019t.**\n\nWhen I called Geico to file the claim, I gave them the other driver\u2019s policy, however when calling into Geico I still had to give them my name and DOB before it would connect me to an agent. Just from that process they were able to find my policy info and they created a claim under my policy, which clearly they had no business doing.\n\nI am going to take the suggestions of the adjusters here and try to get the claim merged under the other driver\u2019s claim/policy. **I\u2019ll keep y\u2019all updated**",

            "comment": "There seems to be a ton of wrong information that has been said. I worked as a claims agent for GEICO. You have made a claim and the agent is telling you that if you wanted to use your coverage that you will need to pay the deductible. The next process is that another agent will have to get in contact with the other party. As it stands, you should 100% be non fault and the other party will have to pay property damage on their policy to cover your damages. If this happens you owe nothing; however, if you needed repairs done faster you will have to use your own coverage and pay the deductible.",

In this case, where it appears the other driver is at fault, and that's not disputed, then you'll probably get the $1k back from the other party before the car is even done being repaired.\n\nAnd you don't \"pay\" a deductible to make a claim. The insurer just shorts your payout by $1k. No money will usually need to change hands until you pick up the car at the end of the repair. Per the above while you should be prepared to pay the shop $1k when you pick up the car, the insurer will probably cover it before the repair is done and you probably won't have to pay anything. Many insurers will waive the deductible mid-claim if the other insurer agrees their insured is liable. Since both of you are insured by the same company that should happen faster.\n\nIn every state in the US (even in Michigan where no-fault applies to property damage it specifically excludes parked cars) you can go through the other party's insurance for payment in this situation. Assuming it's undisputed it shouldn't be any big deal to go through the at-fault party. There's not going to be any material difference in the way the claim is handled unless you paid extra on your own policy for stuff like all-new-OEM-parts being used in the repair, or you paid for $70/day rental car coverage or something broader than what the other party legally owes you on a liability claim.\n\nWhen you have a claim where the other person has the same insurer as you you need to take extra time at each contact to verify exactly who it is you're talking to and who they represent. *Your* adjuster represents *your* interests. The other guy's adjuster represents theirs. The other guy's adjuster has the same employer as yours in this case, but you need to treat them like they're calling from an entirely different company. Most companies split these claims to different adjusters and block each of them from looking at each other's files. (A few carriers will have the same adjuster handle both sides. This is generally not illegal but it makes it awkward for them to defend themselves in court if they end up getting sued by their own insured, so it's not common.)",

No deductible for OP. No claim on his/her record for the next 3-5 years.

I specifically had asked them at the time how it would work (paying the deductible) and that's a summary of the explanation I got - and exactly how it was handled. This was with esurance, btw - which shouldn't matter, but they were really easy. One of the catches is that along with having to pay your deductible up front, it may take a few months to get that money back (the subrogation process isn't exactly \"fast\" but it works).\n\nIt also meant that when we got a rental, we went by what OUR rental coverage allowed (for cost), which was then paid for by the other insurance). Alternatively, if you're going straight through the other insurance, they may have a lower limit on what you can get for a rental.",

But here is what is likely happening:\n\nOP called Geico to start a claim.  Since both parties have Geico, 2 claims adjusters will be assigned, one from OP's policy and one from the other person's policy.  The one from the other policy would  take longer to complete the repairs since they cannot authorize repairs without first determining fault, which shouldn't take too long in this case but it is still a delay.  The one representing OP's policy can go ahead and authorize repairs immediately if OP agrees to pay their collision deductible, an then when the other adjuster determines fault the deductible will be refunded.  So OP now has a choice, start repairs immediately and pay their deductible and eventually get the deductible refunded or wait until fault is formally determined and not pay their deductible up front.",

It probably won't show up in your app. The app is tied to your policy. If you can't find it by calling, call the adjuster for the claim on your policy and they should help you look it up. Or call the general line and provide the other policy number.\n\nIt's also possible the other driver has a coverage issue and they can't confirm if this is a covered loss, so they advised you to handle through your own policy to speed things up and they can refund the deductible when things get sorted out. You can also wait a bit to see how things work out through the other policy's claim.",

Once you do, you can get have Collision claim closed with no payout. Good luck!\n\nThere are some other edge case scenarios that would force you to file the claim under your policy: i.e. the other driver is disputing the facts and claiming they aren't at fault, or the driver doesn't actually own the vehicle and was driving someone else's car, or their policy was canceled a few months ago for no payment and they gave you a dead policy number.

Collision is broken down into different sorts of options and amounts covered under liability, such as property damage, medical payments, or bodily injury. \n\nSo if you use their insurance or yours, the property damage would be paid out of collision coverage. If you pay the deductible, your policy would go to theirs to reimburse you for the deductible, and would reimburse your claim for any payments made for property damage, and/or rental while your car is being repaired (if you have rental coverage). Since the other driver is liable, it would be easier to go through your policy.",

The damage to your vehicle on their policy is classified as property damage under their liability coverage, which just means it isn't personal injury.

A car that was going north on my street was hit by a car going west on the cross street (I was parked close to the corner). The car going north hit mine.\n\nI called and reported, and sent the adjuster pictures. She was able to run that plate and found out that car had the same insurance I had (which is Progressive). She initially opened the claim under my policy so I could get my car in for repairs and waived the deductible while we were waiting for the police report. \n\nIn the end, the police report determined the car going north was at fault, it turned out she basically blew the stop sign when the second car hit her. The guy who got her going westbound also had Progressive. Her policy paid for everything, and her car was totaled. \n\nWorst case, you might have to front the deductible until things get sorted, but your adjuster should be able to waive that if you ask them.",

All that to say, my insurance was not contacted/involved in the collision. I only talked to the other party's insurance and put a claim on their policy. It sounds like its tricky since you both are under Geico. My suggestion is make sure the claim is on their policy each time you talk to Geico and not yours - you shouldn't have to be penalized for something that you didn't cause.",

Our agent wouldn't even take a claim from us when we were the victim of an incident, they told us to call the other person's carrier for that. So it never touched our policy and therefore there was no deductible situation.",

The CHP did me a \"favor\" and called a tow to get me out of there quicker (it was past midnight on an interstate highway) and the tow company kept my vehicle as an impound because they assumed since the CHP called it in that it was being held by them. Longer story short, I had to pay 2k to get my car back in my possession and Geico basically told me to get fucked on the tow and storage fees, which accrued because I had to wait on them to tell me they weren't covering any of it. Immediately dropped them and went with a different company. I suggest you should too.",

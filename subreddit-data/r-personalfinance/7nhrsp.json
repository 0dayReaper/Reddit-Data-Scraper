    "postText": "So over the holiday I received an email with an order confirmation from AT&amp;T (my ISP, and the only one available in my area) and it had a new bill amount (about $5/month higher).\n\nI haven't ordered anything so the first thing I thought was maybe someone got a hold of my account number or personal info and changed it. I immediately logged in to check out my plan and make sure everything was in order. I had a notification that showed that [AT&amp;T had \"upgraded my internet speed at no extra charge\"](https://imgur.com/LrUUetX)\n\nObviously I was annoyed by this, so I dug a little deeper to figure out why the bill had changed. I then found this alert showing that the \"promotional discount\" for this so-called [\"customer loyalty speed upgrade\"](https://imgur.com/PtYazt6) would expire in a month and my bill would go up $20 more per month. \n\nI then looked at my bill and found that they had [upgraded my plan to the highest speed and most expensive plan they have without my consent](https://imgur.com/ThJwB7J), under the guise of \"customer loyalty\", and applied a $20/month promotional rate for 1 month to make it look like my plan hadn't changed and the new bill was probably just some random $5 fee added on like most ISPs occasionally do. \n\nI immediately called and spoke to a rep named Jorge who stated that it was a mistake, that the change was applied automatically and it wasn't supposed to be applied to my account, but after telling him if it was automatic it needed to be addressed immediately because it was probably affecting other people, he confessed that AT&amp;T was aware of it and that they had received many calls about it. I don't for one second believe this was accidental. I believe they are doing it on purpose and hoping that many people won't notice.\n\nMake sure you watch your bills, because if this happened to me it is almost certainly happening to others. I'm not sure what should be done about it (if anything) and I don't personally care at this point because the issue is resolved for me, but I do feel like AT&amp;T should be outed for this shady behavior and that someone should be held responsible, so I wanted to post to show everyone what happened. If this is the wrong place to post, please suggest a better sub. This was just the closest thing I could think of that applied and it could be shared/crossposted from here.\n\n**Edit:** since there were a couple questions about my last login, the 2015 date is inaccurate. I usually log in from my phone but did it via my computer this time so I could make the post easier w/ images etc. Not sure why it's showing 2015 as my last login as I'm pretty sure I didn't even have AT&amp;T then lol ... anyway, [here's the email I received, dated 12/30/17, so this is definitely a current thing](https://i.imgur.com/I7W1VpU.png)\n\n**Edit 2:** Since this is getting a good amount of attention, if this happens to you here's what I did: You should immediately pause your autopay if you have it so the bill doesn't get paid (note that I got this email 12/30/17, two days before the bill was due on 1/1/18, so they definitely tried to sneak it by me). Then call them and they should credit your current bill back to your normal rate, you should pay that month's bill manually, then let autopay resume. As others have noted in the comments ALWAYS WATCH YOUR BILL CLOSELY!\n\n**Edit 3:** Fixed some formatting stuff\n\n**Edit 4:** Holy moly this thread has picked up some steam! Thanks anonymous Reddit friend for popping my golden cherry!\n\n**One last edit:** from a PM I received...the sender wanted to remain anonymous but I thought this was great info: \n\n&gt;I work in big telcom. What you experienced is called a \u201cslam sale\u201d in the industry. It\u2019s when a salesman places an order for you, without ever receiving your approval for the order. The salesman gets credit for the sale, meets quota or receives a big bonus. \n\n&gt;Oddly enough, this is not a very common tactic today. It was popular until 10 years ago, and it\u2019s almost unheard of today. I wasn\u2019t aware that AT&amp;T was experiencing Slam Sales today. \n\n&gt;You can protect your account from Slam Sales. All the major telco providers will offer authentication-secure account protection. Call AT&amp;T, ask for billing, and tell the rep that you want to password-protect your account from unauthorized sales. You can setup either a password or a PIN that must be entered to make any account changes. \n\n&gt;Sorry this happened to you.\n\nAnd another PM:\n\n&gt;I also work for a major telco as well(name is somewhat synonymous with dicks), the account PIN/Password is visible to us when we do verification and would not stop someone from putting sales on random accounts. Pretty much every ISP and cable company uses outdated billing software from the 80's that's a glorified AS400 mainframe running with a 90's era gui overlay.

I got a notice from my bank about my debit card being charged $90 (I get an email for all charges on that card, and link all auto-pay bills to it so I can see who charged me what).  I looked into why I was getting hit for another AT&amp;T charge and found it was for ordering a Samsung Galaxy Note 8.  Then I got an email thanking me for my order.\n\nWhen I called them, I thought someone hacked my account and was buying shit.  After a brief conversation, they told me it was a promotion offering me an upgrade and that I wouldn't be charged.  I told them I already had, the money has left my bank account without my approval, this was now theft.\n\nAfter talking to many people I got them to refund the order, refund my last two bills, and cancel my AT&amp;T account. \n\nIn short, AT&amp;T are not satisfied with just screwing people over with hidden fees, they are thieves.  Fuck AT&amp;T.",

The salesperson got commission for 'selling' a data upgrade, and the customer was usually left in the dark about it. The managers seemed aware of this, but didn't care as it helped the stores metrics. ",

Middle management tells employees they need to get 125% of that goal so mid manager can get his bonus and treats the goal as a floor that he/she needs to fire people if they drop below it. Getting the goal set by upper mgmt was probably reasonably difficult, getting the goal set by mid management while following the other company policies is nearly impossible. They all act surprised when people start cheating to make the metrics like it wasn't exactly what happened the last hundred times their predecessors did it.\n\nThere's (usually) no intent to defraud at the beginning, just gross incompetence from management not understanding that the incentives they set actually have effects.",

However, if I changed a costumers plan to something that was cheaper, this was seen as a negative revenue change. Too many of those and your head is on the chopping block.\n\nThe ONLY way to get any kind of deal is for a customer to ask to cancel. Then they get transferred to retention, who can actually make deals. But I could see, in our system, what retention deal they were eligible for...but I couldn't mention this. So I had to somehow maneuver the customer to cancelling without saying anything bad about the company or \"devaluing\" our product because every call is recorded and listened to by some guy in India.\n\nWhat a fucking joke it all was. At least I got out and now I know how to negotiate with these crooks. Fortunately and unfortunately every telecom uses the same tactics.",

I could see the progression of it too over time.\n\nNow that I think about it, I don't really know why I let it go that long, but I guess I thought the effect was interesting and wanted to see how far it would go if left exposed like that. Pretty interesting, from a scientific perspective, at least.\n\nEdit: it's also worth mentioning that thermal receipt paper is coated with a special chemical or substance in order to enable the printer to \"print\" the burn marks onto the paper, so it's probably something to do with how that substance reacts to light exposure, friction, etc.",

When he \"transferred\" me, he was actually just hanging up because he couldn't figure it out and wanted to hang up on me without saying he's hanging up.

Is there going to be a final bill?\n2. Do you prorate for the unused portion of the month?\n3. How much will the final bill be?\n\nIf you ask a sales/customer service rep the question you the way you stated, you will get a deceptive answer:  \"Yep you're all paid up! (For now...)\".

I missed it the first couple of months before I called them out on it. Each rep said they saw the charge was incorrect and said that they reverted it and credited my account. Each month I'd get the new bill with no credit and a modem fee. It took 9 months to get it fixed, after hours upon hours on the phone and a letter to the fcc. Even then I didn't get all my money back, but I got most of it plus the rental fee removed, so I called it a day.\n\nAlways keep your receipts. ",

I live in Ohio for reference.\n\n**edit\n\nI feel like I should mention that honestly, I'm pretty satisfied with the service after using Verizon, then Frontier (after they bought Verizon's DSL service here) for the last 8 years. Around here there is just no competition and 100+ down was unthinkable 2 years ago when the best you could do was 6mbps down from Frontier for $95 a month. It's not perfect but given the fact that the other companies in the area can't even be called competition I'm pretty content with the quality and pricing so far.\n\nMy comment was more or less confusion about the fact that there's such wildly different billing policies just within the same company, let alone the industry in general. It seems a bit unfair and inconsistent.",

It still goes towards your quota so you are encouraged to add frivolous bullshit onto their account.\n\nFYI, putting a \"password\" on your account isn't going to help if the person you are trying to keep out from adding things is the Sales rep.",

Maybe some promo that got dropped with the speed bump, some promos only worked with certain speed tiers. Going from, say, 18mb to 24mb could void a promo, so the price could actually be more than the usual $5 price increase. Their OMS was a huge mess, and every upgrade seemed to go backwards. So many things were broken or features taken away that we had to  do some convoluted workaround it was ridiculous. Very be gone from that place.",

Very often, if they get enough shady shit like this reported, they'll sue the company to stop it. Sometimes you'll get a refund, sometimes nothing comes of it, but the thing is that you HAVE TO REPORT IT.\n\nCompanies like AT&amp;T count on not enough people being engaged enough to file complaints with all of their consumer watchdogs. The FIRST one you should always go to is your state's AG. That person is politically motivated and can build a large following by pursuing shit like this. I've gotten results from complaints against companies as large as AAA, who  fucked me on insurance, and I've gotten nice \"thanks for the report\" letters. No guarantee, but if there's a recourse and enough voters complaining, they'll follow that recourse.\n\nAlso, why the fuck are you still dealing with AT&amp;T? This isn't a natural monopoly under a Public Utilities commission. There are alternatives.  That company is the devil, and always has been. They were fucking me over 20 years ago, and they're still evil.

The local cable companies were granted monopolies by city councils when it was just television, which had some sort of regulation scheme and was relatively non-essential. Using that access to provide internet service leaves them outside of regulatory framework while providing what has become a vital service under grant of a monopoly by local councils.\n\nPeople need to be far more locally active. Complain to your city council or county board members about your internet access. When they put a cap on, like Comcast loves to do, have a shitfit to the council members and make sure all your friends to, too, so they can't be ignored. \n\nAlas, people don't realize that the more local their focus, the more likely they are to get in touch with someone who has power. Nor do they realize the core problem if their ISP monopolies, which is on a city by city basis.

Then it turned to a 1TB limit with data caps and overage charges with zero improvements and speed degrades due to extra tracking.  \n\nThen after a year or 18 months I got tired of overages, they suddenly add back 'unlimited' but it is 150% the old 'unlimited' rate.  \n\nThe new trick is removing unlimited, then implementing or tightening data caps, then adding unlimited back again at a minimum of 50% increase of cost.  Then do this annually or every 1-2 years.  \n\nAT&amp;T did the same thing with the grandfathered 'unlimited' plans on mobile, they kept upping the cost, then you had to switch to metered, then 'unlimited' comes back at a minimum of 50% increase.  This is the new game. 40-50% increase by switching between metered/limited and 'unlimited' which they nerf you after 20GB.\n\nI guess since healthcare and tuition go up by 20-50% every year that broadband and telcos were sad they weren't in on the new middle class killing predatory pricing that happens in the US now.",

When they increased the price they did not inform about the speed increase, so if you had a modem from Time Warner, it was not compatible with Spectrum protocols apparently. So they just let you sit at 20 mbps while charging you for 100. \n\nI found that out while half asleep watching a show on Hulu and one of their ads came on about the speed and price. I was like hey, thats what I am now paying for but thats not what I am getting. Called the next day, realized I was actually being over billed by $5/mo. Got my bill lowered from $70 to $65 and they sent a new modem.\n\nIts really bad that they get away with this, not letting their customers know. I know for a fact that many people are out there paying for 100 and getting 20 because of using 3 yr old modems. There was never an apology, or refund.\n\nTo top that all off, Spectrum was cutting my moms internet completely here and there to force a service call. She had no idea what was going on for a long time and just dealt with it. Service rep admitted that the company was cutting customers service to inconvenience them to make a call for new equipment or just deal with it.",

There were no robocalls/voicemails or emails to the other email we supplied to Comcast when signing up. \n\nSo our entire area got hit with a data cap that not many really knew about for three months. Then suddenly, December (a couple years back) many people had gotten bills for overages. WTF? turns out Comcast changed their plans, and capped everyone, and by default everyone had the low data plan, which meant a LOT of automatic bills for the new 'overages'. Screw that, I quit Comcast.\n\nMany providers for services which allow for automatic billing, can change your plan without warning you, other than a small note on your bill, or a note on your message box on their own servers, not necessarily your personal email you supplied them with. Many bills may arrive AFTER they have already changed your plan, and THAT is when you get your notice.\n\nAutopay seems very convenient...until it isn't. I learned that years ago, and will NEVER do it again, no matter what it is, even if it's just a newspaper subscription.",

So I signed up with AT&amp;T a few weeks ago and the \"best\" plan they have doesn't allow for me to watch Netflix (on lowest res) while my bf plays WoW or other online stuff without him getting lag. Strike #1. This never happened with Spectrum. \n\nOkay, strike 2 and 3. I signed up to get the $99 installation fee as a $33/month installment over 3 bills. I logged in a week ago and for my first bill, the whole $99 was on there. Wtf? I looked at my original email confirmation for my order to make sure I did it right. Nope, supposed to be $33/month for 3 months. I open a chat with a CS rep and tell him what's going on, he apologizes and says he's fixing it. I get an email confirmation from AT&amp;T confirming that he's fixed it. \n\nThen, yesterday, I log into my account to pay my first bill, which is due 1/6. This is a week after I contacted CS to fix the installation fee- should be enough time to get it fixed, but it's still showing up as a $99 charge on my first bill instead of 33. \n\nLike, what the fuck? This is AT&amp;T, not some small town ho-dunk company or whatever. It's my very first bill and somehow they cannot get something so simple right? Why? At any rate, they did redeem themselves, because when I contacted customer service again, the next guy immediately waived the fee entirely, so that was nice. But I'm still not happy about the speed or the fact that they fucked up my *very first bill, twice*. \n\n ",

            "comment": "Sorry if I wrote a lot on this post, I just wanted to inform people about something else they try to do by changing your payment cycle so they can add on extra fees and penalties. \n\nI had cell service with AT&amp;T and something like this happened to me with my billing cycle. I signed up for cell service with AT&amp;T. I also signed up to be billed on the first of the month I had them put that in my contract. The first month I received a text on the 22nd of the month saying if I didn\u2019t pay my bill my phone would be turned off. I didn\u2019t think anything of it so I paid. Next month same thing happens I get a text on the 22nd saying my bill is over due. This time I called them up to see what is going on. I talked to billing and ask why I am getting text saying my bill is late when I had it setup to be paid on the first. This is when I am informed that my cycle  starts on the 15th and end on the 15th. I told them they\u2019re wrong the contract said the first and they need to change it. The person told me that It couldn\u2019t happen until the start of a new billing cycle. Well I was pissed by this time. My contract was changed without my authorization. In the mean time I asked to be connected to customer services to see why I keep getting threatening texts and emails. I was transferred to customer service where they automatically hung up on me. So I called them back and asked to transferred to customer service and  I would get someone they would hang up on me. Right after that I get online to talk to a rep because I felt there was more they could do. The guy informs me that he could switch my billing cycle right away and does have to wait for the new billing cycle to start. He also said he would look into why customer service hung up on me. I felt I was taken care of and got off with customer service. Once off  I had the conversation emailed to me so I had a record of what I was told. I also received an email from AT&amp;T confirming my billing cycle had changed. \n\nFast forward to the next months billing cycle, and I get the same issue texts and emails threatening me to pay my bill or my service will be turned off. So again I contact the online help. This time they try and say nothing was done and all that happened was an extension was made on my cycle for a month. They said  I never had a conversation about changing my billing cycle and what I was saying was untrue. So I start to copy and past all the information I was told from the last customer support rep and also the email AT&amp;T sent me to confirm my billing cycle had changed. Just like magic they started to see that they did change my billing cycle. However they couldn\u2019t change it back for another three months. I informed them that due to the fact my contract with AT&amp;T was originally signed to have my bill be paid on the first and they had changed without my consent. They had breached my original contract by changing my billing cycle without consent. Since they decided to jerk me around I informed them I was no longer going to continue my service with them. They tried to say I had to pay them for a phone and my phone bill. However, when I informed them they had breached the original contract I had setup to pay my bill on the first of the month and in doing so made the original contract null and void, and that included my payments on the phone. They agreed that I didn\u2019t have to pay my phone off or my cell phone bill. \n\nSo it goes to show you get everything in writing, keep the contract and if you contact them over a billing issue or any issue get a transcript of what you were told. That way if someone try\u2019s to jerk you around and tell you something else you have proof you were told a different thing. ",

After hours of phone calls, they finally agreed to drop the charge.\n\nOn a side note, about six months ago our fee for our internet went up by like $25. Because it happened out of nowhere, we called them and they said that we weren't paying what we were \"supposed to\" for the service/speed that we have, so those $25 were for us to pay \"full price\". Anyway, after a while or discussing over the the phone, the representative agreed to keep our fee the same for a \"small\" change in speed. The guy said that right now we have the internet speed of 24MPS, and the speed will change to 6,000KBS. Now, I know that 6,000KPS is really equal to about 6MPS, or one-fourth of our current internet speed. When I explained this to the representative he laughed it off and said that 6,000KPS definitely sounds bigger than it is, and we just ended the conversation there after convincing him to leave our service alone.\n\nAnyway, bottom line, check your bills, everybody, because I'm pretty sure this happens all the time.",

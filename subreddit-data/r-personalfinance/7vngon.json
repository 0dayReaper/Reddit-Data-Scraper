    "postText": "I've seen a few questions asking if investors should sell their stocks and move them into Treasury Bonds or a Money Market Account. The answer is NO.\n\nMarkets will always go up in the long term. Dips, corrections and crashes are unavoidable, unpredictable and won't hurt you in the long run. Just hold onto your investments and wait it out.\n\nThe only way you can lose money when the market is down is if you sell. If you hold (or buy if you have cash to invest) you will make money in the long run.\n\nEdit: You all got me! I wrote this post to stop people from selling so that my own portfolio wouldn't lose value. As you all know the best way to manipulate the global equity market is to write a post on Reddit.",

But better market cap diversification actually helps when things are moving normally as well!\n\nYou want to minimize expected volatility for each unit of expected return.    SP500 symbols are much more correlated to one another than the symbols of say the Russell 2000.  There are plenty of days where the R2k has been up a tiny bit when the sp500 was down some and vice versa and at varying magnitudes. This is important, because if you own both it lowers the total volatility of your portfolio per expected return unit very slightly in the right direction. \n\nIt\u2019s called the efficient frontier hypothesis. \n",

It basically contains and entire diverse portfolio in one fund (a mix of stocks and bonds, US and international). As you get older and closer to the target retirement date (hence the name), it reallocates the funds to reflect your risk tolerance. \n\nSo I'm invested in VFIFX, which has a target retirement date of 2050. Since I'm young and far from this date, I have a high risk tolerance so most of the fund is stocks (in this case, the S&amp;P 500). As I get older and near retirement, the fund gradually and automatically changes to have larger and larger chunks in safer bonds, since my risk tolerance will be decreasing. \n\nI chose this fund for my Roth IRA, while I have my general savings in the S&amp;P 500 (VFINX). Its main selling point is that since it's all one fund, it automatically rebalances itself so I don't have to. Plus, you can have a diverse portfolio with just one fund to manage. It's just something to look into if you've never considered it before.",

A properly diversified portfolio has only systematic risk remaining. You probably have not diversified away all other risks holding just one ETF. Two main reasons: there is higher correlations among stocks within the same index, choosing a few unrelated indexes is a good idea. Next there is risk with the issuer of the ETF, although minimal, it makes sense to own ETFs from different issuers.\nIt\u2019s a great time to diversify into maybe 3 or 4 etfs to start with. It\u2019s not a major deal, but you\u2019ll find over a long time frame, it really will help you!",

                            "comment": "I think the actual timing makes a difference. For instance, I didn't have a ton of money to invest in 2008, but I did recommend to my Mom that she pull out. I saw what was happening in the housing market, read all the Economist bubble articles, knew a banker who had quite the terrified look when I asked about bad loans.\n\nSo I told my mom to pull out in 2008. And after what happened, she (and others) thought I was some kind of genius. And I felt like some kind of genius. \n\nBut I never told her (nor did I know) when was the time to get back in. \n\nThe 'net net' of this is that she actually lost opportunity, more opportunity than the money I had saved her in the first place. \n\nSo not only do you have to know when to bail (which is open to interpretation), you also have to know when to jump back in. \n\nAnd there are simply too many moving targets to chase after in terms of what's overvalued vs. undervalued. \n\nFor instance, P/E ratios are high. CAPE ratios are high. But CAPE is based a little bit on 2008 - when the 2008/09 numbers drop off the 10 year average, CAPE will look a lot better. Or corporate taxes dropping from 35% to 20% should improve the P/E ratio for any company that didn't get humongous deductions. \n\nBut chasing P/E isn't the only thing you should do. If you think about inverse P/E as a potential yield, P/E = 25 is actually potential yield = 4%. Normally market P/E of 25 is a terrible valuation, and things will tank. But normally interest rates are 5%. So an implied yield of 4% is terrible, and stocks should tank. But if interest rates are 3%, might as well get the growth from investing in stocks, right?\n\nHowever, now we're chasing interesting rates AS WELL as valuations. And how do you chase interest rates if they are set by human beings? And what makes an interest rate happen in the first place? Some people say The Fed sets interest rates and The Fed wants them higher, so they'll move higher. \n\nI think that's wrong. I think monetary conditions set interest rates --- if monetary conditions are very loose for a long time, interest rates will be very high. If monetary conditions are very tight for a long time, interest rates will be very low. \n\nThe Fed can shape those monetary conditions. By pursuing 2% inflation come hell or high water, you can say that the Fed has shaped monetary conditions to be somewhat tighter than in the past, so therefore interest rates will be lower than we think for longer than we expect (like the 1930s, or during the gold standard). If that's true, those 25 P/E ratios don't look so terrible anymore. \n\nBut if the Fed decides the US needs a big reflation, let's wages climb inexorably, or there's some kind of debt crisis fueled by Congressional overspending, that implies higher interest rates, lower rates of real GDP growth and thus LOWER valuations. Now the 25 P/E ratio looks awful. \n\nApologies for the very long-ass rant here. This just to emphasize that while you may know WHAT will happen to the market (there will be a crash, there will be a bull run, there will be many corrections), you don't know WHEN it will happen, or for HOW LONG. \n\nThus, all that to say, buy, hold, and automate your investments. That's the best strategy I can think of...",

A lot of my friends and family think I'm crazy to be putting so much of my savings into the market (mostly Target Date Funds), but I always think about just that. If the market really crashes, and doesn't recover, then losing my retirement savings is probably the least of my worries.\n\nSo that's why my diversification plan includes: the ability to run 5 miles at a moment's notice, a good pair of boots, and some basic knowledge on wild edibles and seed saving.",

I would however say that stocks are great for the young ANd old investor; people should generally be invested in stocks as much as they can be.  \n\nThe timely advice from me is, a market crash is NOT a good time to sell stocks!!!!!   A market crash is a relatively good time to BUY stocks!!!!  BUY not SELL!!!! A multi year or all-Time market HIGH is a relatively good time to SELL stocks.  This is actionable advice; headlines proclaim maket crashes and all-time records prominently.  They are facts.  Doing the opposite of my advice is not smart.",

            "comment": "Donations being tax deductible is just an incentive to donate, it\u2019s not some secret money hack. If you deduct $5k, you don\u2019t pay income tax on it (you still pay FICA on it though); if in the 22% tax bracket, you save $1100 compared to if you just tossed the money in the garbage.  \n  \nAlso, you can only deduct it if you itemize your deductions, I believe you can\u2019t deduct any charitable donations if you take the standard deduction (you used to be able to).",

There are a few complexities I won\u2019t go into, but there are multiple advantages to this (for example, you can still take the full standard deduction), and it\u2019s a great way to make charitable contributions when you\u2019ve reached that age. \n\nAnd if you haven\u2019t yet reached 70 1/2, your future self will thank you for making generous contributions to your 401(k) or IRA, so that you can take advantage of this when the time comes.",

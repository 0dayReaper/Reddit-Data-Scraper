    "postText": "Where are folks seeing the best used car interest rates lately in the US? I'm getting hammered at 9.14% through the dealership. 84 months (no difference between that and 72 months they said) for a used 2021 Highlander LE that I'm scheduled to pick up in the next day or so. $36,700 OTD with 19K miles.\n\nI'm comparing that against the option of a new Highlander LE at $43K OTD with a 4.75% rate. I plan to call some credit unions tomorrow and see if I can do better on the used car. My credit score is above 800.",

Sometimes you need to jump through hoops, like donating a few dollars to a foundation in order to join the credit union and get the rate. But it\u2019s worth it in the end. \n\nI did this and got a rate in the low 4\u2019s a few weeks ago.",

I just bought the 2023 Highlander XLE with $15k down, 5.49% and the payments will be $460 on a 72 month. My score is 680. People say new cars aren't worth it because they depreciate the second you drive them off the lot, but I honestly have no regrets. Highlanders are solid SUVs that can easily last 15-20 years if you take good care of them, great family cars. And high resale value. Toyota also has a 5 year, 100k warranty and I pre-paid for the 2 year maintenance plan. Besides, everyone should get at least one new car in their life. Treat yo'self.",

If it does that means you either didn't take care of it at all or you just bought a crappy car. I don't think it's a predatory loan environment. No one is forcing someone to buy a car. I think the problem is that people expect their new car to have all these gadgets and then also want the pricing if 10 years ago. Trucks for example. Everyone says trucks now cost $80k! Yea they do if you want massaging seats and it to back itself up to a trailer. Or you could spend $40k and buy a nice basic one (mind you that basic trucks is light years ahead of the best trucks from not too long ago)!",

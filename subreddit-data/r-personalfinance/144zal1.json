    "postText": "I got a 6 figure job last year and have just finished paying off all my debt. I take home 9k a month and spend 1.2k on bills and put the rest away in a HYSA and stocks. \nI have enough to purchase the car I want in cash but my credit is only a 630 and I was curious if putting 75% down and loaning the rest would be an ideal way to help build credit as I am trying to buy a house next year. I also have one credit line open that is only 3 months and a secured card. So I'm trying to figure out how to build credit asap",

            "comment": "That would build it a little bit but another good way would be to get a credit card, get a limit that\u2019s hopefully high enough to buy your car and then pay off the credit card. Use it for every day shopping and pay it off every payday and it will build quicker than you think",

They don\u2019t have to even hand you the card, you don\u2019t have to use it, just being on the account is enough.\n\nThis is only if they have good credit though, as this goes in the opposite direction too.",

            "comment": "Holy fuck. I just googled all of them and most of them have a 4.5-5.75% front load fee and then at least a 0.75% expense ratio with some going up to 1.5% (might have been one with higher).\n\nI *think* the cheapest one was the Fidelity Advisor High Income Advantage Fund at 0% load fees and 0.75% expense ratio.\n\nWith these fees if you 100% have to contribute to these I'd make sure I maximize all your other options first (Roth IRA, HSA - if available, 403b) first and if you have a partner, then using your income to fund/maximize their retirement accounts assuming they have lower fees before contributing to your own 457.\n\nWith load fees of 5% you're losing 5% of the money you contribute right off the bat. Then you're hoping that the managers of the funds will select stocks that perform well enough to make up for how much they take every year (0.75%-1.5%ish) then hope that they perform well enough to make up that original 5% you paid them. Anything left over is your \"profit\". It's entirely possible you never turn a profit.\n\nWith fees like these you're saving on the taxes now but you'll still have to pay them when you start withdrawing. I'm not sure you'd even save anything so I'd even advise you ignore the 457 and just contribute to a taxable brokerage account with Vanguard, Fidelity, or Schwab using one of their low fees index funds such as VTSAX/VTI or even a Target Retirement Fund which have fees of 0% load and 0.05%-0.11% expense ratios.\n\nEdit: If your employer is matching your contributions then that changes the calculus but I'm assuming your employer isn't matching.",

    "postText": "hello! i am a 22yr old female, college graduate. i have been insured under my mom\u2019s insurance since i was 15/16 (when i first started driving). credit is \u201cgood\u201d according to FICO with a credit history of 4-5 years. i drive a 2017 nissan altima that is fully paid off. i am needing to get off my mom\u2019s insurance but i\u2019m not sure what the best option would be and how much it will cost. i am in florida so only requires PIP, i am looking to pay $200 or less but i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s possible. ideally i would have comprehensive coverage but beggars cants be choosers",

    "postText": "If you're just starting out, remember that it took your parents decades to collect all the furniture, decorations, appliances, etc you are used to having around.  It's easy to forget this because you started remembering things a long while after they started out together, so it feels like that's how a house should always be. \n\nIt's impossible for most people starting out to get to that level of settled in without burying themselves in debt.  So relax, take your time, and embrace the emptiness!  You'll enjoy the house much more if you're not worried about how to pay for everything all the time.  \n\n",

We aren't rich and our house is pretty bare, but all of the decor we have has a good story and memory related to it, so it means more to us than just taking up space on our walls.",

I think I got the idea from another Reddit thread a long time ago. So we have a wooden utensil set from Cuba, a big wool blanket from Iceland and from Australia we had the same idea as you and we bought a small but nice piece of art from the natives at Uluru. It's a great idea and it's you also get some use instead of clutter out of souvenirs. ",

I get to see beautiful art everyday in my home and my rather extensive collection creates zero clutter in my home. Win-win. My PF cost-saving secret is to buy large solid wood frames at thrift stores and then have a professional framer cut a brand new matte and place my art in the frame. Even the biggest frame and matte will cost less than $100. Custom frames are crazy expensive and not a good deal at all unless you need something very specific. ",

I'm talking about mint sectionals and couches, lounges and 6 month old smart TVs, there's no reason to buy a new TV when you can see it turned on and working at someone's house first instead of opening a box at home and finding dead pixels or dead screens.\n\nPeople move into an apartment or a new city and get a job offer in a different city and pretty much give their stuff away. You have to look in successful neighborhoods in big cities. Wherever there's lots of young professionals there's plenty of them trying to move up and move out and go for better jobs. \n\n ",

I passed out on the couch, and someone may have peed my pants. A lot. Still never found out who.    \n    \nAnyway, it was a nice couch, though cloth, and I didn't want to have it cleaned to move it. It was typhoon wet in the middle cushion and backing. So I put it on CL. I said my friends child slept on it and peed it up (The shame was too great). I said that on the ad, full disclosure. Although I didn't say it was full grown man-pee, pee was definitely involved. It needed to be cleaned.    \n    \nI listed it for a silly price (like $20 because I thought 'free' would take longer than crazy low price). The people that came 2 hours after I listed it asked about the pee area. The lady pointed to the pee \"zone\", then (*shutter*), pushed her spread hand into it until it did that weird wet phhhshhhuuuk moist compression noise. She raised her now moist hand and said \"Ain't that bad!\", then put said glistening hand in her purse and grabbed me $20. She never asked to use my sink. Loaded up the couch and off they went.    \n    \nI don't know how this is relevant. But that CL lady touched my pee.",

He lacks the tolerance for alcohol that he once had, and he starts realizing that he's really drunk. His friends, glad to reconnect with him, continue to buy him shots.  He tries to turn them down but the peer pressure is too great so he keeps drinking until his stomach has had enough. He ends up vomiting on his shirt right there in the middle of the bar. His wife is rather up tight, and he starts to freak out about what she's going to say when he gets home. As his friends are loading him into a cab home, one of the friends tells him to relax, and asks him if he had a $10 bill. The drunk guy reluctantly reaches in his wallet and hands his friend $10.  The friend tucks the money in the drunk's shirt pocket and tells him to tell his wife that a drunk guy puked on him,  but not to worry because the guy felt so bad that he gave him 10 to get his shirt cleaned. Reassured, the guy gets on the cab and makes his way home. When he arrives his wife is visibly upset, demanding to know why he was out so late and why he smells like vomit. Confidently, the man relays the story about someone else puking on him, and tells his wife to reach in his shirt pocket for proof. His wife grabbed the money from his shirt, examined it, and then pointed out that there was actually $20 in his shirt pocket - to which the drunk husband replied: \"oh yeah well he also shit in my pants\".

Mattresses are expensive &amp; poorer people really don't want to throw them away, and even if they do, bedbugs can live in nooks and crannies in a bedside table or even an electrical outlet. So disgusting. If I remember right, they can live almost a year without feasting on human blood.\nMost of the pesticides were banned &amp; they've also become resistant to them. One of the only ways to kill them is high heat, over 120\u00b0F for 20 minutes in a regular dryer. I guess there are services that come to your house and raise the temp to try to kill them all. Always put your luggage in the bathroom when you first get to a hotel, then go look under &amp; on top of mattresses and pillows for dark little spots which would imply old dots of blood. It gives me the heebie-jeebies just thinking about it. I found this evidence at a nice hotel in Florida a couple years ago. I immediately brought my belongings to the front desk and told them. At first they were defensive and suggested that I brought them with, but called their bug guy who investigated and said they'd been there at least two weeks. They thanked me, then shut the whole floor down to exterminate &amp; gave me a voucher for a week's stay to use later. ",

It's a myth that they only live in soft furniture and that they're easy to see. I've had a few friends who have had them and it's been a nightmare for them. I'd rather go without while I save then risk them. I even avoid buying from antique stores unless they have a comprehensive policy in place or it's something I can easily clean/treat myself.",

People travel for work, school, etc. So, if they are unlucky enough to come in contact with a person who just so happens to have bed bugs--well, let me tell you, the nice neighborhood won't protect them or their things they want to sell to you. \n\nIf you've been lucky enough to avoid bed bugs or any other \"fun\" items on your CL bargain hunts I say wonderful and I hope your luck continues. \nHowever, all it takes is ONE item that can't be washed and/or steamed down or treated that can turn your home into a living hell. \n\nI have a friend who purchased a lovely dining set from none other than an, ESTATE SALE in a lovely area, turns out that the wood had some guests attached. \"woods?\" Roach eggs. (I dunno specifically what type, but for story purposes assume they are just the fancy kind that like to hang out in wooded rich areas). Lovely right? \n\nAnother friend of mine purchased a lovely solid bed frame and set another CL 'need to move out by xyz date for closing/everything must go estate sale etc etc.' The set was absolutely gorgeous probably over 15k originally--it brought with it bed bugs. She spent over $6,500 to get rid of them and had to throw out her kids toys and other items that couldn't be washed. It was a nightmare and totally not worth the risk.\n\nBottom line, I refuse to purchase ANY furniture from CL unless it's wrought iron and I'm tossing it outside. Just because a home looks clean, you can never really tell what the item you are bring home is carrying with it and unfortunately people who know they have bug problems aren't going to tell you ahead of time or maybe they genuinely don't even know (some folks don't react to bed bug bites at all). \n\nMy solution? I shop the furniture outlets and wait for deep discounted sales. I purchased an entire sectional from the Raymore and Flanagan Outlet for $499. I also purchased a king size solid wooden frame for $199. My mom hunted at the Macy's furniture outlets and when they are clearing inventory from their warehouses they practically give the furniture away! She purchased three three-person sofa's for 400 bucks. \n\nI do agree that it takes time to build a home. But I say it's safer to save, wait, and stock it with newer items when they become available at a price your willing to pay at a furniture outlet. The alternative could be spending thousands you don't have on emergency pest control last minute &amp; putting yourself and/or your family at risk. \n\nNot worth the, 'bargain.' At least that's my opinion. \n\n*Edit: \nJust some light reading on how pervasive these little buggers can be in any neighborhood. \n\nTake a look at this article from the, *NYMag*. \n\nAn oldie but a goodie: http://nymag.com/news/features/65733/\n\nNotice how complete anonymity was required to print the story and exterminators were required to sign non disclosure forms... crazy right? \n\nI'm getting itchy just thinking about all this! Ugh. ",

We sold her old set to a young couple with the cutest little girl.  When we were shopping for her new set we knew we wanted a solid wood set.  Found a dresser that was a classic style, 20 bucks. We went to pick it up, and the woman selling it was moving out of state.  She gave me about 30 tomato cages, suggested we give her old van a test drive.  Since the 2 kids we had were with a sitter, we agreed.  The van broke down on us, and we called her and told her we'd be a little later because we were going to mess with it and get it going. When we got back, she felt so bad. She said , \" well I'm guessing you don't want the van, huh.\"  My husband joked and said \"I'll give ya 600 bucks for it.\"  She agreed, we bought it and drove it home.   Sold my small car, and fixed the part on the van for 75.00. 3 months later, found out we were having twins.   A month after that, my husband lost his job he had had for 15 years.  That van and the woman who sold it to us kept us from falling into debt and losing a vehicle, not to mention we now had the space to accommodate 4 kids.  I'm sure there are horror stories from craigslist, but there are so many good stories too.  I'll never forget when we left her house she said to us \"we have had so many people help us out and I hope this becomes a blessing for your family.\"  It most certainly was.  ",

Also picked up my shoe rack, a brand new space heater still in the box, two large framed mirrors, and other small household items. \n\nI've made it a point to try and go out during student move out week, I wish I had a truck because I've seen some BEAUTIFUL furniture on the side of the road. Really good solid wood wardrobes, dining room tables, sets of dishes, desks. I saw an entire house worth of new furniture, figured they were waiting to load it, but the moving truck pulled away and they just left it all. There was one set of drawers and a coffee table I BADLY wanted but didn't have a way to move them. There are definitely people in trucks just cruising the neighborhood looking for things to grab.\n\nI've been so bummed when it's been stormy the last couple years on move out day, because everything gets wrecked :( ",

Sometimes you think you need the best version of something, but then you don't use it much and probably could have lived with the cheaper version. I think if you employ this strategy across the board, where possible, you'd save money in the long run. Sure it probably sucks every now and then when a tool you just bought breaks, but you're not considering all the cheap stuff you have that hasn't broken, that you could have potentially spent much more on.",

We really wanted our first house to feel like a home so we set a goal of ~$2000 and my wife went room by room picking out furniture and accessories for weeks before actually going to Ikea. At one point her list was approaching $3000, so we took a closer look at what we really needed after we moved what little existing furniture we had and knocked a few things off the list. We ended up around $2500 that we spent. There were a few things that I questioned the need for at the time, but in hindsight am really happy they made the final cut, like the deck furniture, which it turns out I use more than most of the indoor furniture. \n\nWhat I'm getting at is, Ikea is an awesome inexpensive way to fill your home. We have 2 kids and a dog, so scratches and accidents are going to happen. I would much rather a $150 table be scratched and replace it every 5 years than have a $1000 table that I can't justify replacing so I spend hours refinishing when the inevitable damage happens. We have some IKEA furniture from years before and most has held up well.",

You can buy a particle board bed from ikea for $200, or spend $1000 at sears, and i promise you the ikea one will be more durable. Same with their kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, when you compare them to what you would get at home depot or lowes for 2-3x the price, i'll take ikea -anyday-. Obviously you can't compare with custom solid wood construction but you're also talking 5x the price. \n\nI've been using ikea furniture for 20 years, i've never had a single item break on me. none. I don't know what people do with their furniture that they're breaking it, or maybe they're buying the bottom of the barrel ikea stuff. I bought my lack bed 20 years ago, and now my nephew has it, thing cost me $100, still solid as a rock. And ikea give you a metal rod that goes down the middle to hold your lats, and there will be 15 lats. solid. go to sears and look at their $1000 bed frames, lats are fucking mdf, there's only 5 of them, and there's no center support! they give you this block of mdf to put on the floor under your bed to keep the whole thing from collapsing. absolute junk.

One of them has thrown out around 40k worth of furnishings and carpeting at this point because they can't get rid of them!! The house is too large for the usual methods to work. Not worth it. If I buy anything secondhand, he goes with me, inspects it, then heat treats it just to be sure before it ever comes in our house.

I remember when my dad lost his job after being back to work only a year, and the nights they spent late hours at the kitchen table trying to hold on.  I remember the day my mom had to take my sister and I to the bank to cash out the savings bonds our grandparents gave us every year for Christmas so they would have enough money to stay afloat another month. And I still get a knot of anger in my chest every-time I remember the cashier's having the gall to say to my mother \"there goes their college educations I guess\".  As if he knew anything about her, or the value she placed on our futures.  I remember sitting in the backseat fuming with rage at the nerve of some stupid kid while I watched my mom try to hold her tears in on the drive home.  I remember the my mom trying to hide our food stamps at the store when we would shop for groceries.\n\nMaybe your kids were really to young.  But I wouldn't worry even if they were not.  I'm proud of my parents for what they struggled through.  I'm glad I have these hazy memories to learn from.  My parents were the generation that climbed my family into the middle class.  I'm glad I remember the sacrifices they made and the hard work they put in to give me the life I have today.\n\n\n\n",

I would definitely educate myself on the signs of bedbugs and do a thorough inspection. And I would definitely use a mattress encasement and/or a waterproof mattress pad to protect the mattress from damage and lessen the ick/creep factor for myself. ",

            "comment": "As a side note to this, I want to stress the importance of a quality couch. Certain furniture items the dirt cheap versions will serve you fine. Not so much with couches. When I was first starting out my fiancee and I bought a cheap sectional couch at Value City furniture for $750. It looked nice enough and was comfortable, but the stupid thing fell apart in less than a year. By two years it holes all over it, was covered in dog fur and the frame had actually broken in one spot and the whole thing sunk lower at one spot. So eventually we get so sick of the couch we decide to go buy another one, which I'm not too thrilled about since I think it might just end up like the first. This time we went to a halfway decent furniture store and spent $3500 for a leather couch, large chair and ottoman. Good Lord this couch is so much better. A big problem with the old couch was it couldn't handle our dog. He thinks he's a cat and loves to climb on top of furniture and perch. The new couch both shows zero scratch marks from him and it repels his fur since it's leather. Good leather is very durable. I have friends who complain their dogs scratched up their leather, but ours shows zero wear after four years with it. When I sit on other leather couches now I notice their leather is usually much thinner feeling than ours. Whatever it is it's working. Like I said it's been with us four years and has gone through an interstate move and still looks as good as the day it was delivered. I'm confident we'll have it for another 10 or 20 years, which is much cheaper than the $750 one than lasted two years on a per year basis and it just looks nicer overall. It's also more comfortable, especially the chair with the ottoman. You just sink into the thing.\n\nNow this just couches. Some stuff the cheap stuff is at least good enough until you can get something better. For example, I have a coffee table I got at Wal Mart for $15 (Mainstays Parson's table) that's still going strong ten years later. Sure, it looks and particularly feels cheap (it's made of particle board and is very lightweight), but it functions perfectly fine as a coffee table and only shows any signs of wear on the edges. I bought it when I was in college and only got around to replacing it this Spring with a coffee table I built myself in a woodworking class I took, and even then we didn't throw it away because feel bad throwing away perfectly good furniture. It's now used as an extra storage shelf next to our entertainer center.",

My father was an antiques restorer who used to do side-jobs rebuilding frames for the local upholsterer, and I've seen the inside of a lot of the imported furniture. It's often so cheap and flimsy that it's a wonder it holds together, and is packed full of scraps of whatever is lying around - to the point where I bet I could pull a random person off of a street and they could probably do a better job. I'm talking about the relatively expensive end of cheaper furniture here, even the stuff that comes from fancy stores that heavily advertise how everything is 'designed in Italy'  or whatever BS they think will work.\n\nUnfortunately, it still often works out cheaper to simply dump the old couch and buy a new one of similarly shitty quality than to it is to have it fixed and completely reupholstered, which both rewards these people for producing made-to-break crap and is a huge waste of resources (and over the long-term, money).\n\ntl;dr - if you're buying new furniture from anywhere other than a furniture store that makes it locally/in-house, then expect the build quality to be rubbish.

            "comment": "Personally, I'm a huge fan of Ikea furniture. Especially for stuff you aren't going to sit on. Our entertainment \"center\", our side tables, my husband's desk, and our dresser are all Ikea. We have a hand me down kitchen table and chairs from my father in law, our stools are amazon.com specials that are really stools that go in like a shop or a commercial kitchen. Places where we splurged? Our mattress (used to have two twins that we had from before we were together ratched strapped together) is from tuft and needle (looove and highly recommend). Our couch is from Costco. My husband's computer chair for his office is from Amazon and while he spent like 300-400 bucks still sometimes says he should have spent more on it given how much time he spends in it. \n\nAnother funny anecdote is that a partner at my old (accounting) firm is in his late 30s with a wife and kids. He just posted on Facebook that he and his wife had just after 10 years of marriage accomplished one of their \"adult\" goals by replacing their last piece of Ikea furniture (their kitchen table). This is a man who has been making 300k+ a year for at least 5 years, and had been making 6 figures for at least 10 years.",

Your employer should let you know what the \"vesting schedule\" looks like. Some employers vest immediately, but some don't.\n\nThere's no situation where you \"owe\" your employer money.\n\nWhat *could* happen is if you leave your employer before all of the match has vested, then the balance in your 401k may drop when the (now former) employer takes back the amount they put in that hadn't vested yet. It's not a penalty -- it's just that money wasn't really \"yours\" yet.\n\nYou should keep putting money into your 401k. You should do whatever contribution is needed to get the match, and more if you can afford it.",

            "comment": "Any money you had put in from your own pay is 100% yours to keep.  Money from an employer match might have a \"vesting schedule\", where the amount you get to keep might be some percentage of that portion.\n\nMoney in a retirement account has to stay in a retirement account until you, well, reach retirement age or you'll get charged a penalty on top of taxes (which you'll owe on that balance at some point anyway).  But it doesn't have to stay in **this** retirement account.  Moving between accounts is a \"rollover\".  You can rollover into any account you're allowed to contribute to; this could be a personal IRA or a work plan at a new job. \n\nWhen you do a rollover, you only get to move the vested portion of the balance, which includes your own contributions.  Losing unvested match isn't really a \"penalty\", it's just that money wasn't yet \"yours\" to keep / move.  Again, this depends on whether your plan has a vesting schedule at all, and if so how it's set up and so how far through that you progressed.\n\nIf you take no action yourself, what happens next depends on your vested account balance:\n\n1. Balance &lt;$1000 means the investments are liquidated, cashed out, some amount (IIRC 20%) sent to the IRS to pre-pay tax+penalty, and the remainder sent to you.\n2. Balance between $1000 and $5000 gets rolled out of the plan but into an IRA, probably at the same brokerage.  This is effectively the same as you doing a rollover yourself, but may leave your money at an institution that may not be best for you.  And this rollover may not maintain your investments, it's usually left sitting as cash until you re-allocate it.\n3. Balance above $5000 can remain in the 401k.\n\nOptions 1 and 2 typically trigger 60 days after your last date employed.  Could be longer (depends on the plan) but can't be shorter.  \n\nIf option 1 happens, you then have 60 days from receiving that check to do an \"indirect rollover\" into some other retirement account to negate the tax/penalty.  You'd have to deposit even that missing 20% that was withheld to fully negate it, but if you did then the amount withheld becomes unnecessary and you get it back from the IRS as part of your refund when you file your taxes and report all this stuff.\n\nWith option 3 all your money stays as-is, but since you're no longer an employee any account fees the company may have been covering now become your responsibility.  Like the automatic IRA rollover, this may not be your ideal place to keep your money.",

Rollover to new 401k or IRA\n3. Cash it out\n\nExceptions: if under $5,000 the old employer can force you out of the plan by rolling it to an IRA. If under $1,000 they can forcibly cash it out and send you a check.\n\n&gt;I also read you can get a penalty if your employer ever matched what you put in, or if you plan to switch the money over.\n\nYou might be thinking of unvested match, meaning you didn't work at the job long enough to be fully vested (though you may be *partially* vested).\n\n&gt;I just want to make sure I don\u2019t lose the money I have in my 401k whenever I do move on\n\nYou lose any unvested match whether you stay in the old plan or not, so it has no bearing in the decision.\n\nReasons to rollover: simplicity (one less account to manage), possibly avoiding fees in the old 401k\n\nReasons to not rollover: new 401k has poor fund options and/or high fees. Personally, my new 401k would have to be *really* bad to convince me not to roll my old 401k into it.",

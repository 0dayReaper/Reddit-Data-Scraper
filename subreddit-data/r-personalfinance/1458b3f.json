    "postText": "Received a notice from IRS that we owe about $18K on taxes from 2020. We can setup a payment plan, but I'd rather just get this over with and pay it all. We don't have $18K in savings, but we have that in our 401K/IRA.\n\nIs there any scenario where it would be better to take an early retirement withdraw to pay off the full balance so that we aren't left paying for the interest until it's paid off?\n\nOr are there any other recommendations that I should follow? Really not sure what the best course of action is.\n\nUpdate: Thank you to all who responded. Sounds like it\u2019s unanimous that the plan is the way forward.",

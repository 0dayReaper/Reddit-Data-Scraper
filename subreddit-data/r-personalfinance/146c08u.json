    "postText": "Basic Info: Seeking to purchase a house for \\~400,000\n\nCurrent house value \\~300K (paid off, no mortgage payment)\n\nIncome: \\~200K combined, but only looking to factor in my \\~150K for loan purposes\n\nPotential current house rental income: \\~2,000/mo (minus taxes, expenses, management)\n\nNo car payments\n\nMy partner and I are interested in purchasing a house but we have no down payment. I was curious about using a Home Equity Loan for about $20K for the purposes of a down payment to hit the 5% needed by my credit union to get a fixed rate mortgage (looks like a 30 year is in the 6% interest range) as they do not require PMI. I understand there is some potential stickiness as far as the source of a down payment. Essentially, the current house is owned by my partner, they would take out the home equity loan, and we would use that for the down payment for the new mortgage in my name (assuming that's not a loophole that would raise concern with the bank - I still have to look into their policies on something like this, we're just kicking around hypotheticals).\n\nTo head things off at the pass in case this bleeds into relationship advice territory, I've put somewhere in the neighborhood of 20K into their house and we are okay with the potential risk here - if things fell apart we'd consider it a wash and each still walk away owning a house, which is another reason that renting out the current house appeals to us instead of selling it (again we're just kicking around hypotheticals). That said, the available space to more comfortably start a family if/when we desired is some of the impetus for exploring these possibilities.\n\nAs far as renting out the current house, I am aware of the possibility of it sitting empty and various complications and expenses (taxes, repairs, management taking a piece of the pie). To put a positive spin on it, in our zip code there are only a handful of places even available to rent and it looks like 2K is in the ballpark of average asking rent, considering our house is also in good shape.\n\nIs this ludicrous or am I over thinking it? It's my understanding that conventional wisdom would suggest that not having a down payment ready would indicate that one isn't ready to purchase a house, but not sure if our circumstances would change that.",

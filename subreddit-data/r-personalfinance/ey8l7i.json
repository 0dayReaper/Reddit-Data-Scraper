    "postText": "Not sure if this is common knowledge but I noticed this yesterday when filing my federal taxes yesterday. I had to use TurboTax deluxe because of some additional things I had to add in and I don't want to use paper. They mention that it costs $40. No issue there. When choosing a payment method you have the options of using a card or allowing them to take it directly from your returns. Underneath the latter they mention they would take $40 directly from your returns. What they fail to mention is that it's an additional $40, not the $40 you pay for deluxe. So you'd end up paying $80 in total for choosing this method vs $40 for entering your card info. Caught it when I was reviewing everything.  Heads up guys.\n\nEDIT: My problem with this is that they made it seem like it's a part of the initial $40 not as an additional fee. The language used seems intentionally misleading.\n\nEDIT 2: First time that I've had to get TT Deluxe. Very new to filing taxes too, sorry if this has been repeated before. It's honestly new information to me.",

Any service that does either of those for you (and turbotax is just one of MANY that do) is going to get a big cut for basically loaning you a tiny bit of money for a tiny amount of time.",

[Disclaimer: I report based on comments I've read rather than personal experience, but I've read... a *lot* of comments in threads like these.]\n\nThere are some caveats -- they have far more limitations than anything else (e.g. no multi-state returns) and while *most* people seem from comments to be happy with them, they've also seemingly had many more calculation and other *errors* reported than anything else, and I would not trust my return to them without cross-checking against something else.\n\nI'd also suggest you read their TOS and privacy policy and be OK with them using your tax data for targeted advertising, though there are mixed reports on whether and how much you can opt out from that.",

They can import last year tax returns, but nothing new from this year.  Also, I really didn't like the fact that I couldn't skip ahead.  Like it wouldn't let me even look at the deduction page until I was completely done with the income.  My investment forms aren't available until the middle of february, but I usually start going through early.  It was like being tied into Turbo Tax's Interview only mode.\n\nI'm not trying to say don't use FreeTaxUSA.  Especially for people with simple returns, it make far more sense.

But it is a service that they are providing by not taking your money until the refund comes in so it makes sense that both FreeTaxUSA and Turbotax would charge for it.\n\nEdit: Just checked, FreeTaxUSA's fee is $20. Still overpriced and a little surprising considering the rest of FreeTaxUSA is so reasonable.",

Still overpriced and a little surprising considering the rest of FreeTaxUSA is so reasonable.\n\nSo FWIW, there is actually a fair bit of stuff going on behind the scenes to make this happen. The IRS attempts to crosscheck the name on the account they are direct depositing to against the name of the person who is due the refund, and on top of that prohibits preparers from sending refunds to accounts they control. As a result, my understanding is that what is going on behind the scenes when you select to pay for your refund or get a refund anticipation loan is that the tax prep place has an arrangement with some bank out there to open an account for you, use that for direct deposit information, wait for the refund deposit, take their fee out, pass the rest to you, and then close the account.\n\nI'm still not sure if it *actually* costs significant money to banks to open or keep accounts open or how much of things like account fees are just because they can, but this machination with the behind-the-scenes bank account is at least a large part of why that feature is surprisingly costly.",

No one should **ever** pay through their tax return.

And for 1099B, I can just enter a single amount - the total in cost basis and total in gains. I just have to specify whether it is short-term or long-term though (if I have mixture of two, I'd do one lot of short-term, another lot of long-term)\n\nFor others who have used TurboTax paid versions for a long time and have grown sick of using the product, I'd highly recommend they check out FreeTaxUSA.

I *also* would suggest [Free File](https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/) as a *first* option if you make under $69K, and would specifically recommend H&amp;R Block from that list if you qualify (unless you are so ethically opposed to using them that you won't even file for free), and I tend to recommend FreeTaxUSA above CK based on the strength of its recommendations even though it is merely *very cheap*.",

In googling how to solve this, the only answer was heading to tools towards the bottom of the left-hand panel and selecting clear/start-over. \n\nEndlessly frustrating that you have to start over and re-input all of your information to remove Deluxe form your account. I was shocked by the $120 I would have to pay in filling out my 1040 form (again, with the federal fee, the state fee, and the 'removing my fees from my return' fee) and just cleared everything and re-input my information while cursing to myself. Was annoying doing everything over again but I'm glad I didn't pay 120 dollars for the use of one form. \n\nI was also able to find a little bit of a work-around in just paying the IRS directly what I owed for my 1040 file, $9 (https://www.irs.gov/payments/direct-pay). I'm super thankful for google/reddit other people asking these same questions because I'm not sure if I would have known that I didn't have to file with TT to make sure the IRS received money owed for my special form. I'm also SO glad I didn't have to spend $120 to submit my $9 tax. \ud83d\ude2a \n\nIf you still have to fill out a specialty form, I'd suggest going through the inputting process, selecting Deluxe, and filling out as much as you can on TT regarding your special form to find out what you owe. At this point, don't click file your taxes-- just go back and clear everything, make sure you have the free version, re-input your W-2 or 1099 information and submit. You can use the amount owed that you saw from filling out whatever special form you needed and just pay the IRS directly from your bank or debit/credit card-- no 40 dollars required. Feel free, anyone, to correct me if this process is wrong but from what I gather, paying the IRS directly is quite straight-forward and can save a lot of the hassle that comes with the special forms the free versions of TT and HRBlock don't cover.",

There was nothing that stated I would be assessed the extra fee.\n\nLike you, I paid double for their software.\n\nI emailed them and complained. I'm sure the fee was buried in the fine print.

    "postText": "My wife and I were at Panera eating breakfast and we noticed a lady be hind us talking on the phone very loudly. We couldn\u2019t help over hearing  her talk about a bill not being paid. We were a little annoyed but not a big deal because it was a public restaurant. We were not trying to listen but were shocked when she announced that she was about to read her card number. She then gave the card\u2019s expiration date, security code, and her zip code. We clearly heard and if we were planning on stealing it she gave us plenty of notice to get a pen.\n\nDon\u2019t read your personal information in public like this. You never know who is listening and who is writing stuff down.",

The call then goes something like this. Scammer: Hello this is the front desk. You card didn't go through for some reason. Just to save you the hassle of having to come back down. Could you give me the information on your card. So that I can rerun your card. I'll also need the name on the front of the card as it shows on the front of the card. Guest: Calls off all the information on their debit/credit like a good little kid! Scammer: ok thank you and we hope you enjoy your stay with us! Click! And now you just gave all of your information to a scammer! Some scammers even get as so bold as to ask for birthday and social security # as well over the phone like that. The only way i know about this method. My wife works the front desk as a manager at a certain hotel chain. And their policy is when you call and ask for a certain room number you must also know the guests name as well. And you also can't just ask to speak to guest so and so. That goes back to you must also know the room number as well! The hotel reply to that one is. If you'd like to leave a name and number we can give them message.",

But it also only allows me to see the last 4 digits so it's not like I can \"steal\" it in the sense of going out on some crazy shopping spree. I could however charge a large amount of money and hope they don't notice. . .Not that I would, I'm just saying it's possible. . .It would just be really easy to tie to me or my employer. \n\nNobody I work with has a problem with it. They have a card on file for the purpose of a monthly charge and if they happen to also buy something from my proshop I can just ask \"Would you like me to just charge your card on file?\"",

It's very common for people to expect you to be able to charge a card on file where they're already paying you for something (i.e. especially for membership renewal, etc), and there are secure ways for merchants to be able to do that without ever needing to see the card data.  Typically, when a customer provides their card the merchant sends it to their payment gateway and the gateway sends back a token.  That token can then be stored by the merchant, and if they need to charge the same card again, they can provide the token instead of the card number.  Tokens can only be used by the merchant account that created them, so if that data was somehow stolen, it'd be useless to whoever stole it.",

He was disturbing the people around us with his arrogant self importance. We asked our waitress to have the manager ask the guy talking to please speak more quietly as his voice was interfering with us and the other diners.  The \u201ctalker refused\u201d to lower his voice. So, we asked for another table but there were none available. So, we had our meal prepared to go and left the restaurant. \n\nIn the car, my husband started dialing his phone. He had heard mister \u201cI\u2019m so special\u201d make a tee time at a nearby golf course including his full name, phone number and credit card number. \n\nMy husband called the golf course and with all the information, cancelled the tee time.",

They talked about who was who in the office and how they felt about their boss and their organization. \n\nTwo hours after the plane landed a rough transcript of their five hour conversation was emailed to the client and everyone they had mentioned in the organization.\n\nI've no idea what fallout resulted, but hopefully they learned that just because you don't care about the people within hearing range, it does not mean they can't hear you.

The first time he sent it to me in an email I was like, \u201cdude, what the fuck?\u201d And him and all the other boomers I work with where dumbfounded that I found that super inappropriate to do.",

She typed down the card number and security code while he read them. Sitting next to them I heard everything through the phone. Didn't think much of it, could happen to anyone but when she started to read them back to make sure they were correct I had to stop her.\n\n\"There are 20 students in this lab and theyll all have your fathers credit card if you continue\"\n\nBlush she did.",

He and my mom live together but are not legally married. \n\nI am exploring all options but have always found this community helpful so checking here as well. \n\nWe are in NJ. We are looking into temporary disability. We don\u2019t know if he should apply for social security yet, or if he should try SSDI, or if they can both be taken simultaneously.  He pays his medical insurance premium out of pocket and it is not associated with his employer. \n\nMy mom still works, but can\u2019t survive on only her income. Trying to find the best course of action here. If anyone has any input it would be much appreciated.",

It is better for most people to apply sooner due to the way social security counts quarterly earnings of applicants.\n\nHe may be eligible for short term disability leave from his employer; he should apply for that. Also, if he\u2019s worked for his employer for more than 12 months, he may be eligible for fmla and should apply for that. Even if he doesn\u2019t expect to return to work it\u2019s better to stay on payroll usually for some benefits. His health insurance may also be tied to his employer.\n\nYou should discuss with your mom what your role is and what she needs. \n\nMy husband was approved for SSDI with a fast track approval for SSDI in 2013, with a life expectancy counted in months; he is stage 4 now and still in treatment. A lot of cancers now can be treated effectively to extend life. Make sure your financial plan encompass a range of outcomes.",

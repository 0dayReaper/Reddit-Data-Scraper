    "postText": "Hello y\u2019all, me and my fianc\u00e9 are looking into financing a car in about a month or two. I know that currently it\u2019s a bad time because of interest rates and the inflated car market but we need something good and reliable for her job. \n\nOur buying range ideally is between 15-20k for ideally a used Prius and we have about 4-6k we can put down. We make about 95k combined. We don\u2019t really know much on credit, she\u2019s never taken on any credit cards or loans because her family has some pretty severe credit problems that\u2019s made her very weary of it. Mine is at about 670 currently, which isn\u2019t good. I\u2019ve had an OpenSky card at below 30% utilization for 3 years now, always paid on time but that\u2019s it. I also have about $300 worth of debt due to some things I didn\u2019t pay off ~5 1/2 yrs ago. \n\nMy main question is how should we approach buying a car with this in mind? From the little I know, I think the debt more or less falls off after 7 years right? Is it worth it to pay off the debt for the minimal score increase? I can easily afford it, I just don\u2019t know what it would do in terms of my credit score because it\u2019s been on my record for so long. If I paid it off how long would it be before my credit is adjusted to reflect that debt being paid off? Should my fianc\u00e9 get a credit card before we take out a loan or will it not matter since it\u2019s so close to taking out the loan? We\u2019re planning on opening a joint account at a credit union to use for bills as well as compare rates to the dealerships, is this a good plan as well? Thanks for any advice.",

I'd imagine most banks will want 10 to 20 percent down with a score under 700. \n\nAlso they'll be able to tell you the best way to boost your score.\n\nAlso don't finance through the dealership unless you have great credit that qualifies for their zero interest rates. You'll get a better loan through a credit union or bank.",

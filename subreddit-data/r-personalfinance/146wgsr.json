    "postText": "EDIT: seems like it doesn't make sense.  So, will more seriously consider exchanging the truck.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am going to be starting a new job in about 1 month that is going to increase my daily commute from about 40 miles total to about 120 miles total.  This is (hopefully) a temporary increase as the plan is to move closer to the new job in approximately 1 year.  Normally we would move now, but for a variety of reasons moving right now isn't the best - one example is that my wife is pregnant and due in just over 2 months.  No, this wasn't the best time for a job change, but I didn't have much of a choice...\n\nMy current driver is an F-150 (averages around 17mpg) that I purchased at a steep discount from my FIL.  While I wouldn't say I \"need\" a truck, it definitely comes in handy to just throw kids junk in the covered bed while toting them around to sports practices and such.  I'm not currently planning on replacing the truck, but it is something I am considering.\n\nMy question is whether you would consider purchasing (in cash) an inexpensive fuel efficient vehicle?  We have a healthy emergency fund and I am currently on severance with my old job, so it wouldn't be a massive burden to make the purchase.  I also would wait until I have actually started the new job...just to be safe.  I haven't done any hard looking, but a quick perusal on [cars.com](https://cars.com) seems to show that I could get an older toyota corolla or honda civic for around $5k-$6k.  But, the question is how old would you consider and how many miles?\n\nFor my math: 120 miles per day at 4 days per week = 480 miles/week; our local gas prices have been averaging around $3.50/gal.\n\n\\- Current Truck (using 20mpg since commute is almost all highway, but lower than the claimed 26 highway mpg due to a truck cap): expected cost around $85/week\n\n\\- Small sedan (using 30 mpg, but I'm being quite conservative): expected cost around $55/week\n\nSavings of $30/week or \\~$1,560/yr.  I have ignored my weeks of PTO because I would plan to drive the sedan around town for further savings if I have it. Obviously it takes several years to break even if I keep the car \"forever,\" but how much would the car truly depreciate after a single year?\n\nI'm also not taking into consideration car insurance costs.  I haven't looked into a quote, but I would decrease my mileage significantly on the truck which would decrease my cost...and I would assume the cheap, old car would have much lower insurance costs.  Plus, I would likely only do liability insurance on the cheap, old car which is even further savings.",

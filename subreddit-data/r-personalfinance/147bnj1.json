Eventually all of the reporting bureaus will basically catch up to each other. That said, they may not be identical. All the bureaus use slightly different metrics when they calculate scores.\n\n716 is a good score. The trick is keeping it there or making it higher. There are some tings you can't really control right now (like how long your accounts are open) but you can do a few basic things that I can think of: Pay all your bills on time (for everything). Always use less than 30% of your total credit card balance. Be aware of how many credit checks and accounts you have. Check your report for errors and get them fixed.\n\nGood luck building your credit!",

If you have no credit history the biggest impacts will be your utilization rate and new credit inquiries. The best way to build credit is to use your current card rarely and pay the statement balance in full every month. Keeping it in open can add to your credit history but it's only useful if you aren't paying interest on things you buy.",

    "postText": "Hey everyone, I am still trying to grasp the best time to purchase VMRXX. It seems as if the dividend is paid out at the beginning of the month. So, when is the cutoff date to buy shares in order to get paid the dividend? Would it make sense for me to hold money in my HYSA until a particular day, then push that money to purchase shares in VMRXX at a more efficient date? I don\u2019t want to buy shares if I have gone past a date when it will earn interest. If I am thinking of this incorrectly, please let me know. Thank you!",

            "comment": "&gt;when is the cutoff date to buy shares in order to get paid the dividend?\n\nThere is no cutoff date. Money market mutual funds behave like high yield savings account. Interest accrues daily based on your daily balance, and is paid out monthly.\n\nFor example if you buy on June 2nd (the day after they pay the May interests) and hold until June 29th and sell all, you will still get paid interest, on July 1st, for your balance in almost all of June. Exactly like a bank account.",

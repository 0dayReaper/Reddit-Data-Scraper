I think the stocks are price high, P/E 25 for exemplo.  \nI think I should start with a safer and stable return investment and in the future with open an account to invest in stocks. Is there a found about 8% per year?  \nFor a while o would like something monthly or annually interest.  \nAny advice?",

Full disclosure, I own VZ and T since last millenium.\n\nVerizon PE is 6.92\n\nBut, the price of VZ shares could go down, especially if this is a short term investment.\n\nJust do a HYSA or a CD.\n\nMy local banks are offering CDs at 5% or more for 13 month and 14 month durations.",

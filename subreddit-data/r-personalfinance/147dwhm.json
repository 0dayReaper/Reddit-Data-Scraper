    "postText": "So I just finished up reading through JLCollinsnh Stock Series and realizing that my inheritance could probably be better invested.  His arguments for low cost index funds (VTSAX) are compelling and make   \nsense to me.  I'd like to transition this inheritance(\\~500k total) into this approach to avoid higher expense ratios and management fees.  Here's the breakdown:\n\nThere is \\~$110k in an unmanaged Edward Jones account of mutual funds that all seem to have   \nhigh expense ratios.  There is \\~$340k in an actively managed RBC account of individual stocks.  Another \\~$25k in an unmanaged RBC account (all PNC), and another $25k sitting in cash in RBC.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI know it's not a simple question, but what's the best way to transition these funds?  The plan is to put it all in VTSAX and not worry about bonds since I'm 25.  Here are my thoughts as of now:\n\n1. Move the RBC cash over\n2. Sell funds that have unrealized loss, move them over\n3. Sell some funds with unrealized gains to match the loss, move them over.  I was thinking to start with the highest expense ratio mutual funds.\n4. I've taken some time off this year and my income will likely be below $40k, so if my understanding is correct I could sell more to make the difference in my income to $40k with 0% tax.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter this is where I become more unsure.  There's \\~$95k in unrealized gains, if I sold more I believe I would have to pay 15% tax.  I would expect my income in coming years to be above $40k.  I know I should try to keep the taxes paid on these as low as possible, but not sure exactly the best way to do that.  Do I just suck it up and pay the 15% on everything else?\n\nHow does this plan sound to you all?  Any suggestions for things to do differently?  Any feedback is appreciated, or if more information is needed let me know. Thanks",

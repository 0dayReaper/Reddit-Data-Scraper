    "postText": "What would you do if you were in this situation? \n\nIf you owned a home outright with no mortgage, would you sell it to pay off student loan debt? Then you would buy another house and now have a mortgage, but the student loan debt, credit card debt, and car loans would all be paid off. (The total amount of debt owed is about equal to the price of the home). \n\nWould that decision be worth it? Or is it better to keep the paid-off home and keep making the payments?",

            "comment": "the process is a whole less scary that you probably feel it is, the biggest issue is that it is sloooooowwwwww......\n\nOne year I forgot to include stock sales that were pretty much a wash; the sale price was just about the same as the cost basis. All the IRS received was the stock sale amount so I got one of those letters saying that I owned taxes on the full amount. I responded with a mea culpa, send him the document showing the cost basis, and I think I owed them like $200 bucks instead of the few thousand they thought I owed them.\n\nSo; sanity check everything. The letter should explain where they think there is an issue. Either there is, and if so you are on the hook to fix it pay, or there is a mistake that you can document write them back. A few snail mail back and forwards later you should be set.\n\nAnd it is slow... You'll send a letter, they'll send you a letter saying that they got your letter, then you wait for the next letter where somebody actually looks at your letter and responds with substance.",

Why on earth are you not asking them? They took your money for this service!\n\nIf that's not the case it sounds like it is time for you to have an expert look at it. In order to avoid all the \"sponsored\" content and everybody else trying to make a quick buck out of you even if not related to your problem, Open google maps, zoom on your location, and search for the word \"tax\". You'll see the accountants and tax preparers in your area. Call them, tell them you got a letter and that you need to \\_pay\\_ for a quick hour or so for some guidance as to what you need to send to the IRS so they are happy and won't come to your house to kill your dog.\n\nMostly relax; this is not a big deal, just an inconvenience. Well it could be a bigger inconvenience if you owe them thousands but that's life.",

    "postText": "A tale as old as time... I was humbled by the market pullback in 2021 and vowed to take a more conservative approach with our family's finances. Wife and I both have decent 401ks and I converted our retail trading account to a mutual fund with Northwestern Mutual along with a solid Term Life Insurance policy for us both proportional to our salaries. Last month, I let the rep talk me into converting our Term Life to a Whole Life policy and upping the monthly payment a decent amount. After reading and reflection, I'm scared I made a big mistake. It's only been a month or so since converting, should I revert back to term? Any advice is appreciated.",

See an insurance broker who can shop multiple companies at once.\n\nDo not mix investing with insurance.   Whole life policies tend to be incredibly inefficient.  Your salesperson, however, is very happy.",

Depends on what is written in your specific policy.\n\nMore likely than not, NWM isn\u2019t going to let you \"convert\" back because\u2026 it\u2019s not in their best financial interest.  Maybe your policy allows for it.  But probably not.",

They have no incentive to make sure what they sell you is a good fit, so long as they close the sale. And bottom line, for most people, whole life insurance is not a good product.",

It costs $18/ month. I bought a second $250k term life insurance policy a few years later. It costs $25/ month. \n\nThese are both 30 year policies so the premiums will never increase. Even if i get sick or have medical conditions later in life. I pay $43/ month for $500k of term life insurance that will last until my early 60s.",

You just want enough in there that by the time you retire you'd have around 5 years of living expenses outside of stock market. It's great as bond replacement, except it's more liquid, so you can use it as \"buy the dip\" fund or emergency fund before retirement. Can expect around 5% tax free return over life of policy.\n\nNot sure why you chose mutual fund, index fund like VOO should be OK with much less fees.",

            "comment": "Having a portion of your overall financial picture devoted to a conservative approach is completely sensible.  Whole life insurance, with the right policy, is certainly one way to have that approach.  I believe it makes particular sense for 1).  People with consistent excess cash flow 2).  Are in a 30%+ marginal tax bracket 3).  Those who value the idea of having a permanent death benefit.  \n\nThe great thing about properly designed whole life is you can begin to use it pretty much from day 1.  I\u2019m not sure what kind of policy you signed up for, but in general it\u2019s no where near as bad of a product as some on this sub would lead you to believe, if you check those boxes I mentioned above.",

But you will need to call / read the plan documents and see. And some effort may be required to complete the process. \n\nTerm is most likely your best choice. \n\nI also want to address how conservative your investments might be. I don\u2019t know from your post what the makeup of your funds are, but you shouldn\u2019t worry about short term fluctuations so far from retirement age as the key is growth and beating inflation - over the next 20+ years.",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nIs it possible or how hard would it be to get an FHA loan after 3 year post-chapter 7 bankruptcy? Has anyone gone through something similar? If so, any tips or what bank did you get to approve you? Currently a 720 fico with relatively low DTI and 15-18% down.\n\nTIA",

    "postText": "Over the summer I made a steadfast commitment to getting my 3 month emergency fund built, which is only about 15k. I'm saving $750 a month, which is exactly 15% of my family's post-tax income. In the 3 months since I made that change, I've had $1.8k in car repairs, $600 in vet bills, and $250 to cover a friend who got towed from our guest parking (our fault). Needless to say, the needle hasn't moved as I wanted it to, and I have to keep reassuring myself that, had I not made this commitment, I'd be in real trouble covering these costs. The end goal will come eventually. \n\nEDIT: Just to clarify - this is a two person budget!",

Good job. \n\nSame thing has been happening to me. I\u2019m working on paying down debt and only have a $1000 emergency fund, but in three years I\u2019ve had to spend $500 to repair my leased car my fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister crashed, emergency surgery for my fianc\u00e9\u2019s cat, and probably others that I\u2019m forgetting now. I just got it back to $1000 again after having to move in July and my spending getting a bit out of control because of it. ",

She managed to fuck the whole side of the car from the side view mirror, the driver side door and the backseat driver side door. It was about $3000k worth of damage. Two doors needed to be completely replaced. My deductible is $500. She even agreed to pay for it. But when push came to shove she backed out of it. To make matters worse her whole family thinks I\u2019m in the wrong. $500 is not worth that kind of headache. At the end of the day it\u2019s just money. ",

It isn't in the interest of us as a company or in the interest of any of our customers for them to drown in debt, so it's worth asking if you need help for serious issues you have in paying off CC debt with us.\n\nThat isn't to say we'll always be able to help, but as I said before: asking is the only way you can know.\n\nEdit: I'm happy to hear so many of you have had a good customer experience with Discover. I do my best to help and to understand where everyone is coming from, and there aren't many better feelings than knowing you made someone who was in a stressful situation feel a little bit better about their day.\n\nDebt is difficult to manage, but taking it into your own hands and reaching out is always going to be a good thing.",

Couple of questions--did you initially call the regular customer service line or one of the specific hardship depts? And was there any verification/proof of hardship required? I have the ability to show all of my income and bills to prove it but it's a lot easier to just say 'I maxed out a few cards and now have no money left over after bills'. ",

I did not have to give them any proof of hardship although I do think the representative asked the reason for hardship to be notated in the program. I can't be positive if it still works the same way as this was over a year ago, but if they still offer the program I would imagine it is similar! Good luck... it really helped me out!",

Someone from Discover called me to try and get a payment. I started bawling at what my life had become. I ended up crying so hard that I couldn't speak and just hung up. About 15 minutes later I got another call from them, this time it was a supervisor. She said they were really concerned about me and wanted to make sure I was ok and that they would do whatever they could on their side to help me. I've never forgotten that kindness. I ended up being able to make minimum payments until I got on my feet. All of my other creditors had to send me to collections. Discover was the only one I ended up paying off. Once my credit had recovered, Discover was the only company that I opened an account with again (secured card). Now my credit is fantastic and I've built up a savings for a downpayment on a house. ",

My mother is a VP at a bank and I asked her about this; people who carry balances into debt are significantly more likely to become financially insolvent or not pay the debt, making them high risk.  The company only makes more money if they manage to pay off the debt eventually without defaulting it having the debt sold off to a collector.  As the company takes a cut of the Visa fee off of every transaction, they make the most money off of customers who spend a lot of money and are consistent long term customers rather than those who carry smaller amounts into balances.\n\nThen you are a low risk, consistent stream of revenue where they don\u2019t have to spend time harassing you to pay, getting creditors to come after you etc.  \n",

You\u2019re right that credit card companies get a cut from visa or MasterCard on every transaction, but the rewards that companies pass onto you (cash back, points, etc) erase most of that\u2014especially if you\u2019re a creditworthy individual, as the rewards for upmarket cards are better than for subprime cards\n\n2. Losses are much, much, higher on subprime cards obviously, considering a much higher likelihood of default, costs to the company in collections, and a relative lack of of assets of the cardholder. That being said, those are factored in when they\u2019re originating cards, and never, ever underestimate the power of interest. They still make money on those transactions from visa and MasterCard  and the amount of money they make in interest is mind boggling. Consider also that most people are always trying to pay down their credit cards (albeit often unsuccessfully) until it gets completely out of control. The move into defaulting on your card is usually a more gradual slide, and most people end up completely paying for their original payments and owe exclusively interest. Otherwise, these cards wouldn\u2019t be economical\n\n3. Upmarket cards are simply way more expensive to originate. It\u2019s crowded at the top, so advertising is much more important. Additionally, early spend bonuses make upper-tier cards incredibly expensive to originate\n\nThe fact that a lot of upmarket cards have yearly fees should tell you pretty much all you need to know in terms of economic viability. That being said, when adding in the yearly fees, there\u2019s an important place for these cards for CC companies\u2014having a portfolio of entirely subprime cards is a massive liability\n\nSource: probably obvious but I work at a CC company ",

The point of 3-months expenses is to cover you in case of job loss or various minor expenses.\n\nBeyond that, it's generally better to put the money in a tax advantaged retirement account and have it earn interest. In case of emergency you can still withdraw (for a %10 fee) but the idea is that this level of emergency should be rare enough that the tax saving/interest earning are more than worth it. Also the fee can be waived for a variety of reasons including medical costs. Alternatively you can borrow from it and pay yourself back with interest.\n\n6-month expenses is not a crazy amount, but ask yourself why you actually need that much. I personally find that the more is in my EF the looser my definition of emergency becomes, where as I see 401k as gone unless I *really* need it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Estimate a bit on the higher end if possible, and then you have a nice little fund to throw at your next car if it doesn't get used by maintenance.",

I started using YNAB recently (recent college graduate with first full time job) and I had been doing really well with meeting my aggressive savings goal. Then real life happened a few months later and I had to unexpectedly fly back home for my grandmother's funeral. My ticket alone ended up being almost $2k. At the end of this year, my original savings goal won't be met but I do consider that I had done a good job with my savings. I'd rather have $2k less and be able to honor my family commitments during an emergency. Plus, I didn't have to go into debt to cover that unexpected expense. All that's left to do is to keep moving forward. ",

            "comment": "This is a good point, and you saved yourself some headaches by working on the emergency fund.\n\nThat being said, you should ideally also be budgeting a certain amount for car maintenance and repairs separately from contributions to emergency fund/savings. Maybe you're already doing that and just didn't mention it, but it is good to think about for anyone who might not be. Vehicle costs can't be predicted precisely the way many other expenses can, but you can still get an idea of what to expect by looking at how much you spent on maintenance and repairs in previous years. \n\nPersonally, I take my yearly expected costs and divide it into a monthly budget in Mint where the leftover rolls over each month. If an accident or unusually expensive issue causes the costs to exceed that budget, the emergency fund comes into play. But if I'm not too unlucky, things like repairs and new tires/parts will all be covered by my budget.\n\nIn general I think it's good to try budgeting for some irregular/surprising expenses you might expect to face. The emergency fund is a big part of that of course",

They aren't consistent recurring expenses or high-frequency purchases you can control easily. So if the costs exceed expectations you might want to dip into the emergency fund to cover them. However, these are things you *should* expect to come up at some point, and can estimate a reasonable range for how much they might cost you over a year or so",

I would argue for example that car repairs are not necessarily an emergency. If you have an old clunker that has to go to the shop regularly, that's a regular expense. You would not treat oil change as an emergency?\n\nI am/was also \\_really\\_ bad at this, I guess what I am saying is that you need to be really honest with your budgeting. I had yearly inspection of the car eat away my Christmas bonus for years, not thinking about that. I increased the car budget to include it, and now I actually gave a Christmas bonus.\n\nThings like your friend getting towed sounds like a thing that used to happen regularly to me, so much that I actually made a monthly budget for \"unnecessary sh\\*t I dropped the ball on which could be very well avoidable\". Parking tickets. Late payment fees on bills that just slipped my mind. Forgetting my phone charger for travelling and having to buy a really expensive one at the airport.\n\nThe great thing about that? Once you start tracking how much you not having your shit together costs you, you work more on that. The unused budget for this afforded my wife and me a nice weekend getaway this year (our way of rewarding ourselves for adulting better).",

Savings account took a hit but managed to get it back to where it was.\n\n- Next year wife got pregnant. Didn't grow our savings account by very much but didn't take anything out.\n\n- This year, new daughter needed heart surgery. Again...managed to not take any money out but it's frustrating to see that account balance stay stagnant.\n\nOn the plus side we're not in debt on anything except our mortgage. I'm still able to sock away some money into a 401k every month as well which I don't consider usable so I'm never worried about having to use it.",

I've just paid off my student loans and am working on knocking out my mortgage asap, but wanted to save 6 months expenses before starting to pay down the mortgage more aggressively. Basically as soon as I started building the emergency fund, unexpected expenses started popping up. But I keep telling myself that even though paying for those things wasn't the goal, working on the goal is what's allowed me to pay those costs without any stress. Still moving forward, just maybe not at the pace I'd envisioned. Something I think about a lot - \"progress isn't linear.\"",

Insurance prices are so inflated it is ridiculous.\n\n\n",

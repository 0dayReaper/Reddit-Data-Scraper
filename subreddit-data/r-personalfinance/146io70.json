No debt at this time.\n\nI currently rent a apartment with my S/O and we split the expenditures. \n\nWith that being said I do not have a IRA/401k/Roth,(Employer does not offer one) I did recently just open a HYSA and am in the process of moving a portion of these funds to it.\n\nI've read the wiki \"How to handle $\", however unsure of what companies or indexes of such to look into\n\nI guess what I'm looking for is pretty broad the more I re-read what I've written. With that being said please feel to enlighten me down below with anything you might useful. \n\nCheers",

If you're having trouble deciding between them, ask yourself whether you like red, green, or blue. \n\nCheck if your employer offers a 401k or equivalent (such as a 403b or 457b for nonprofit or government).\n\nKeep reading the wiki, there's probably more there that can be helpful. r/Bogleheads also has some useful material.",

Just set it and forget it.\n\nMax out a Roth IRA asap. There is a book you can borrow from your local library. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle. This book was written for beginner investors emphasizing investing in broad market ETFs like VTI or VOO for their simplicity. Just set it and forget it even during market corrections until you retire. Broad market ETFs for the win.\n\nIf you have extra money max out and invest in a health savings account (HSA) if you're eligible for one.\n\nIf have more money, gradually max out your 401K to $22500 if you're comfortable with your monthly budget.\n\nMax out all retirement accounts before investing in a taxable brokerage account.",

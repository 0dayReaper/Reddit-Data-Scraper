    "postText": "Should I max my Roth IRA\n\n20M with 10k in income saved. I live at home at have a part-time job. I\u2019m starting a degree in CompSci this fall and will continue to live at home throughout college. I don\u2019t have a 401k so the Roth would be my only retirement savings. Im attending community college and then transferring to a University after 2 years to save $. I\u2019m just wondering if it\u2019d be smart to max it out now instead of doing it over time.",

Lump sum investing has shown to be the better investment strategy over dollar cost averaging.",

I'm maxing out my Roth and my top tax bracket is 24%. All taxes in, I have to earn about $1.50 for each net dollar I contribute to my Roth. Then there is the fact that the more years it has to grow, well the more it will compound up.\n\nIt is a sacrifice worth making.",

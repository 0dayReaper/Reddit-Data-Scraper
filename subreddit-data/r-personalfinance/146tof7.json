    "postText": "Hi I want to open a 529 plan for myself and I am a little lost. \n\n1. I want to use Vanguard to manage my 529. But Looks like if I choose Vanugard 529, I dont get the state tax deduction. Is it possible to purchase something like BrightStart using vanguard?\n2. If I move from my current state to a new state. Can I keep the current 529 plan or do I need to change the state asap?\n\nThanks!",

But if you want to be able to take the IL tax benefit, then you *must* use the IL 529.\n\nFor this reason, most would recommend just using your specific state's 529.",

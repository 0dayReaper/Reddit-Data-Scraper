    "postText": "Hi, I've been a lurker for a while but decided to ask for some advice.\n\nI'm in my mid-late 40s. Married with 2 children. Here is my financial situation:\n\n* 200k gross salary for the family currently. Wife is a full-time mom which works well for us. I expect my salary to continue to rise at a decent clip for at least the next 10 years.\n* About 490k left on my house mortgage, but no other debt. House is currently valued at about 1M. My mortgage rate is pretty great at about 2.7%. Refinanced right before the pandemic.\n* 120k in 401k (Got a late start on this). Currently maxing out my contributions here.\n* 100k in stocks/funds that is managed by an investment advisor. Not really interested in putting too much time into investments personally, so it seemed like a good idea. Last couple of years have not been great obviously, and this account has lost about 10k. BUT, t his is a long term investment, so I'm not really too worried about a 2 year dip.\n* 25k currently in 529 accounts for my kids. I contribute $600 per month into this. My kids are pretty young so I'm probably looking at not retiring any time soon haha.\n* 150k worth of company stock that fully vests in 2 years. It's a tech company with very good stock prospects.\n* 120k that is currently just sitting in a Capital One HYSA earning 4% interest.\n* I maintain about 20k in my main checking account.\n\nMain Questions:\n\n* What should I do with the 120k in HYSA? I know that's way too much for rainy day, so I'm thinking I should only leave about 40k and invest the 80k into:\n   * A brokerage account to buy S&amp;P 500?\n   * Buy CDs or T-bills etc for even higher interest rates?\n   * Give that 80k to my investment advisor to add to that portfolio?\n   * Something else?\n* Anything else I should be doing overall?\n   * A personal IRA account maybe?\n\nFeel like I'm doing what I can, savings and investments-wise (while living pretty comfortably with my family admittedly) but my Fidelity account dashboard tells me I'm way behind on my retirement goals, so that makes me nervous.\n\nThanks and would love to hear your thoughts! Have a wonderful day!\n\nEDIT: Per several people's recommendation, I've gone ahead and opened a personal Roth IRA account and put 6500 in there to buy S&amp;P500. Tried to get my wife signed up as well, but ran into some issues with linking my bank accounts to her Roth IRA account. Linking was denied for some reason that I haven't figured out yet. Anyway, just wanted to provide that update to everyone that has been so helpful. ",

Ask yourself what you would do if you got the 150k in cash instead, would you take all that cash and buy your employer's stock? Probably not, you would invest in something else. So think about selling all the RSUs as soon as they vest and convert to something else like VTI or VOO.",

Switch up to a low cost broker and start dollar cost averaging buys while reducing the savings account. \n\nAlso, what is the point in 20k in checking? There are no longer 6 withdrawal limits in savings account. I have all my payments coming from a HYSA, and keep like $500 in checking.\n\nYou should be doing a Roth IRA in my opinion too.",

There are dividend investors that have been preaching the last 15 years about how companies with 2%-3% dividends are fantastic pieces of an investment strategy.   As long as it is FDIC insured, you should feel safe keeping that as a part of your investment strategy up to 250k.  T-bills arent that much higher but if you are not touching the money anyway and don't mind managing them, that is another option.  ////  If you want more money in the market, give it to the investment advisor or put it in the s&amp;p 500 and don't worry about managing it (which is what Warren Buffett recommends).  Maybe you could have an experiment and put 90k in the s&amp;p 500 and see what grows better the managed money or the unmanaged money \ud83e\udd11",

There's no wrong answer, just risk appetite. It's been a while since we've been in an environment where $100k could earn $4-$5k guaranteed annual interest in a liquid, FDIC-insured account, and I'm enjoying that ride at the moment.\n\nAlso FYI, your Fidelity dashboard will tell you you're way behind because *they want you to give them more of your money*. I worked in financial services marketing - even the helpful tools have ulterior motives :)",

    "postText": "My wife is having problems transferring her 401k from an old employer to her current employer's plan. Her previous employer went bankrupt and no longer exists which is making things even more difficult. The 401k plan was opened with Wells Fargo as the account manager but it's through Nationwide, so she accesses everything through the Nationwide site. The old employer has a company account number, but her account is based on her SSN. When we try to transfer to the new employer's plan at Schwab, Schwab said they need an actual account number for her.\n\nShe then called Nationwide, and the rep there told her that she had to fill out a form from the old company's plan administrator who would submit the request to Nationwide to begin the transfer. But, as I said, the company no longer exists, and the HR rep is obviously no longer there. I'm told the original account manager was with Wells Fargo, however no one from Wells Fargo has a clue about this either. Wells Fargo has also transferred all their 401k plans to Principal. After calling Principal there is no account there for her.\n\nWe are stuck. We just want our money. We can't even withdrawal it, take the 10% penalty and pay taxes on it. Does anyone here have any advice, or has gone through something like this? Anything? I've never heard of a 401k plan that the employees require someone from the company to sign off on in order to get our money. We want out so we can stop getting assessed fees.\n\nFrom what I'm told, none of the other former employees have had any luck either. The Nationwide rep she talked to saw that no one else at the company had transfered or closed their accounts.",

            "comment": "Is Schwab for real? 401ks never have account numbers, and they should 100% know that. \n\nOnly thing I can think of is give Schwab the *plan number* for your old 401k. If possible, don\u2019t get into the details with them, meaning don\u2019t tell them it\u2019s the plan number just say it\u2019s the account number to satisfy them. \n\nAs far as all the transfer business, ultimately the old 401k pushes it to the new 401k (or IRA). While it is possible there must be additional sign off by the old employer, whoever manages the 401k has to help you sort all this out. They need to escalate this problem and get you a resolution, don\u2019t let them pass the buck",

Whichever firm (WF, NW, Principal) was the trustee **will** have the plan documents and be able to figure out what the withdrawal procedure is, and if it requires any kind of paperwork. Then just the usual process\u2026\n\nI hear firms asking for account numbers pretty frequently, which is ridiculous. The old trustee should have the plan number, and if not, just make up a number that\u2019s like 4-7 digits long \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. I can\u2019t imagine it becoming a big deal unless maybe the new employer is highly regulated and requires lots of documentation or something",

While signature from a plan sponsor is not unheard of (some employers just want to \u201ccheck the box\u201d during the process) its nationwide\u2019s responsibility to initiate that, not send you on a wild goose chase. *Nationwide* reaches out to the employer. \n\nAnd \u201csignature\u201d shouldn\u2019t literally mean ink signature, an email confirmation from an authorized contact should suffice. \n\nAND if there is no one left at the employer to verify this, nationwide needs to figure that out for you too, just just throw their hands up and leave you hanging \n\n&gt;If you ask to speak to someone's manager, does that actually happen? I've never had luck getting anything \"pushed up the ladder\"\n\nYes absolutely. You can still do it politely but you may need to be firm. Front line people aren\u2019t the decision makers of course, but their job metrics often discourage escalating the matter to their boss. But if you push they\u2019ll elevate it",

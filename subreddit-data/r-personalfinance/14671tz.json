    "postText": "I max my 401k and with all fixed costs I have 3000 left monthly. 6 percent mortgage with $620k left to pay off. I won\u2019t be here forever, I just moved in a few months ago. Should I pay an extra 1500 per month? It seems like it gives me a great return until I can refi, it is sad to see almost all my money going to interest right now and that principal loan amount not coming down each month. Or could that money be put to Better use?\n\nI have 200k in stock market too so I can do a lump sum but I don\u2019t know if I want to reach into that. \n\nI would have 1500 left (I already budget $500 monthly for random expenses each month, taken into the fixed cost), and I don\u2019t eat out much.",

Invest in it like a Roth IRA. Tax deduction on your contributions, earnings are tax free, can be used on most medical expenses tax free at anytime. After 65, you can use your earnings on any purchases but it will be taxed as ordinary income. But medical expenses still tax free. Pay out of pocket now but save it for your retirement.",

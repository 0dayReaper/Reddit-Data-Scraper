You could throw your cash in a CD and then start using that CC to pay for everything. After a few to several months of only the minimum payments you\u2019d have a maxed out card. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t advise it, pennies in front of a steam roller sort of situation, but that\u2019s how you could do it.",

If you can get a $100,000 0% interest card (good luck) you can make some real money, but if you get, say, a $5,000 limit card, you're looking at $12 a month assuming rates are steady.",

    "postText": "Good afternoon, \n\nThis is two separate questions but both about Fidelity. I\u2019ll divide them with lines:\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI currently use my credit union to hold my emergency fund (will be $18k USD AFTER doing the additions I mention in the next paragraph) but between the past few years of inflation and my COL increasing, the amount I have stored has decreased significantly in purchasing power despite increasing in dollar amount a little. \n\nSo, I\u2019m about to refill my emergency fund to make sure it covers 6 months again (it used to be 8, but the above factors brought it down). I want to move it out of my credit union savings account and into something with a higher annual return to help keep its value up. I don\u2019t see any mention of high yield accounts on my credit unions website. They do have higher (but still sub-3%) accounts for people with very large balances, $25,000 for the lowest (1.5% annual) bracket which is a bit above my emergency fund goal. \n\nAre Fidelity\u2019s Money Market Funds a good choice for this? I want to be able to withdraw funds quickly and with minimal, ideally no, penalty in case I actually need the emergency fund\u2026 knock on wood. \n\nIf not, can you please recommend an alternative? \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nI currently keep my personal stock portfolio (all ETFs and similar safe investments) on Webull. I am interested in switching my account over to Fidelity and was wondering if anyone has used them as a brokerage and if they\u2019d recommend them (website and app opinions both highly appreciated). \n\nWhen switching, I would also consider switching to an IRA (or other account type) through Fidelity if that would be advantageous over a regular stock portfolio. My next (3+ years away) major purchase will be a down payment on a home. Please let me know your opinions.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThank you for your help!",

            "comment": "I am a fan of Fidelity.  I have a setup I love:  I have a taxable brokerage account, and my core position is set to SPAXX.  This position tends to follow HYSA rates more of less (current 7-day yield is 4.7%).  So, I hold my investments in VTI, and my eFund in the core position.  All money is in one spot, one account, serving two purposes.\n\nBonus: I ordered a debit card and checks for this brokerage\u2026 and any money comes out of the core position.  So, I actually direct deposit my paychecks right into the brokerage, my bills come out of the brokerage, and my eFund sits there.  I have the discipline not to actually dip too low so the balance remains as large as my eFund need.  It\u2019s a great way to \u201cinvest every dollar I don\u2019t need\u201d.   Any amount over my eFund + the float needed to pay bills can be invested.",

I'll continue to pay bills and entertainment out of my credit union checking account while actively moving excess funds over periodically. \n\nThe approach you described does sound really good and like it would offer objectively better returns, but I want to do the first transitional step now and then think more about that later",

            "comment": "I use Fidelity for my primary checking (I use their Cash Management Account) and brokerage for high yield savings by buying money market funds--the default core position is SPAXX.  I also have two additional brokerage accounts--one for investments (eg. stocks, mutual funds) and another for fixed income (eg. brokerage CDs, T-Bills).  I keep them separate to make it easier to look at a balance and know how much cash savings I have versus T-Bills vs long term investments.  I also opt to use the CMA vs doing everything from the savings brokerage since the CMA gets unlimited ATM fee reimbursement and to act as a firewall between the outside world and my main savings.\n\nI keep half my 6-month emergency fund liquid in MMFs and the other half in a 13-week treasury bill ladder earning over 5% interest.  Any excess cash not needed immediately either gets added to the MMFs or into either 4-week or 13-week treasury bills depending on expected need by date.  If I find myself in a dire emergency, I can sell the T-bills on the secondary market for next business day access and can get pretty much get my face value for them.  The same is not true with brokered CDs.",

Is it as simple as you being notified every 13 weeks your previous treasury bill has reached maturity and then a few minutes to start a new one? That doesn't seem so bad four times a year.\n\nIs there a reason you don't do that with 100% of your emergency fund if it can be quickly withdrawn without penalty?",

                            "comment": "Since cash is fungible, realistically most of my excess cash is already in T-Bills so depending on how I measure it my entire e-fund is already in T-Bills.  I just make it a point to always keep a certain amount of my cash savings in something instantly liquid in case I need the money that same day.  So in my case I like to keep about 3 months worth of living expenses in cash or MMFs.  Another thing I didn\u2019t mention so as not to complicate my prior answer is I keep half that 3 months at a separate online bank to act as a backup in case my primary account at Fidelity gets locked or hacked.\n\nAs for the treasury bills you can set them to auto-roll, so they will automatically purchase a similar length fund when the old one matures.  The only con with using Fidelity vs Schwab is you need to call Fidelity to end the auto-roll. I can\u2019t seem to find an online way to turn it off.",

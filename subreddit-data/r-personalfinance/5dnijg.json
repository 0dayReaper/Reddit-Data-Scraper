    "postText": "On the night of November 1st/early morning of November 2nd, someone made 8 separate withdrawals of $600 each(Total $4800) at ATM machines in Tarrytown, White Plains, and lower Manhattan from my dad's account and then phone transferred another $5000 from his savings account to his checking account. Then the thief made three purchases at Target with a debit card, charging $1000, $2000, and $2000 respectively. The total amount that was taken out of my father's account was $9,800.\n\nWhen he checked his email on November 4th, my father immediately called Bank of America and notified them of the fraud and filed two claims (one for the saving and one for the checking accounts).\n\nAfter waiting several business days for the result of the investigation, my father called BofA to check on the status of the claim and was told the claims could not be paid because they did not see any errors on their part with their system! They reopened the claim but then closed it again several days later.\nI don't understand how the bank can deny responsibility. My dad has never told anyone the pin number for his debit card(not even members of his own family). When you put money in a bank, it is suppose to be safe and now he feels violated because not only was this money stolen from him, but now they are trying to say that they are not at fault.\n\nHe was informed by a BofA associate that someone had called in requesting a new debit card on Oct. 27, 2016, but he did not make a call to BofA on that date. I don't understand why the bank would allow this unusual activity to go through, or how they could let a thief phone transfer his money between his savings and checking accounts! Also, how can the bank authorize a new debit card to be mailed and what exactly is required for this request to be granted? He did not make the call to request a new debit card! Where are the security checks in place for any of this?\nMy father filed a police report and the detectives assured him at that time that the bank would return the cash. They said that as long as the fraud is reported within 60 days, the bank has an obligation to return the funds.\n\nThe last time he spoke with a BofA manager in a local branch, they actually reassured him that he would be getting his money back and that the process just takes time.\n\nBut this is the letter that my father received from BofA today:\n\nWe\u2019ve completed our investigation of your above referenced claim and based on our findings, we\u2019re unable to honor the claim\nbecause the transfer was made to an account that you own and the funds were made available to you for personal use, used to\npay an obligation owed by you, or both. As a result, we\u2019re respectfully denying your claim.\nWhat you need to know\n\u2022 We based our decision on our records and the information you provided when you contacted us about your account.If you\nhave additional information pertaining to the transaction(s), please contact us at the toll-free number listed below.\n\u2022 You may request copies of the documents used in our investigation and we\u2019ll mail the information to you for your records.\n\u2022 We now consider this claim closed.\nWe\u2019re here to help\nPlease call us toll-free at 1.800.317.6345, Monday through Friday between the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET, if you have\nany questions.\nFraud and Claims\n\n\nAt this point, what should he be doing? Contacting the local news? Getting a lawyer and suing BofA? I asked him to mail a certified letter with return receipt to BofA so that there is a paper trail of all of this.\n\nAccording to the FTC, he should be fully covered.\nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/\u2026/0213-lost-or-stolen-credit-a\u2026\n\n\nEdit:  Thank you all for your replies and comments.  I will do research into what federal agencies to file complaint at and I will keep everyone updated on any additional details.  In the meantime, I will try to answer some of the questions that were posed:\n\n1) The thief called BofA and requested a new atm/debit card on October 27th and it was mailed to my parent's home address.  I believe that whoever called BofA to request the card also stole it from the mail.  My mom's account at BofA was not compromised but my parents were very upset and did not want to take any chances, so they requested replacement cards for both their accounts (their accounts are not linked) after the incident. \nBOfA mailed my dad's debit/atm card and pin on separate days as requested, but my mom's new debit/atm card and pin still arrived in the mail on the same day.  I am guessing that this is how the thief was able to get ahold of the card/pin.  \n\n2) A lot of people are asking why the withdrawal limit was so high.  My dad received a letter in the mail a few days after the fraud occurred letting them know that their withdrawal limit was increased to $2400.  Apparently, the thief called in and requested to increase the daily limit.  They then made 4x$600 withdrawals right before midnight on November 1st, and 4x$600 withdrawals in the early morning of November 2nd.  By the time my dad got the notice that his withdrawal limit had been increased, his money was already long gone.\n\n3) I have no idea why the thief had to do a phone transfer to move the remaining 5k from the savings account to the checking account.  I would think that you could do a transfer right at the ATM. I think there should be a recording of all of these various phone transactions and BofA frankly does not care to look into them.  They also don't care to look at the videos from the ATMs.  \n\nEdit#2: Update\nGreat news!  Bank of America has returned the money to my dad's bank account.  He received an email to log into his BofA account to check some new messages.  After he logged in, he saw that his funds had been returned and the messages stated that his subsequent follow up claims had been approved.\n\nThe next step is to find out from BofA and exactly what information the perpetrator had that allowed them to request a new debit card from BofA to be mailed to my dad's address.  I saw a lot of comments that asked why my dad didn't file a police report, but he did!  I realize that the first post was a huge block of text, but I did mention that he filed a police report. It's just buried in that text.  A lot of people also mentioned that it might be someone close to him such a a family member, but this is pretty much impossible.  My mom and dad immigrated to the US over 30 years ago, so we actually don't have any other family members here, as the rest of the extended family is overseas.  I'm their only child and I live on the west coast while they still live in NY.  I also doubt that they fell into bad company because they are some of the most straight laced boring people you'll ever meet, lol.  They don't drink, gamble, smoke, etc. In any case, the next step is definitely to figure out how this happened in the first place. Hopefully BofA will be able to provide us more information in that regards.",

            "comment": "Hi buddy, I am a moderator over at /r/banking. Right now, it seems like the person who did this is someone who knows your dad. Or your dad fell into some serious situation where he compromised enough data for someone to KYC successfully on the phone. The letter you received could just be due to someone not filling out a dispute form properly.\n\nHave your dad call the bank and ask to speak with his caseworker. If the ATMs were owned and operated by BoA, they should have pulled footage from all claimed ATM withdrawals AND a few past withdrawals that aren't being disputed to determine if there was actually a different person who withdrew the money.\n\nIf the ATMs are not owned and operated by BoA (think ATMs in random stores), BoA cannot pull footage from them. The police will have to handle that. \n\nRight now isn't the time to go running to the CFPB (the CFPB is pretty busy, no reason to automatically run to them yet) or another enforcement agency. If they continue to deny the claim, ask to have all relevant documentation sent to him.\n\nNow, if he does take my advice and they still deny the claim, then I would recommend going to regulatory agencies.\n",

                    "comment": "Bank Manager here -- this is all good advice. Biggest thing I would add is to have your father file a police report. It sounds like the debit card and PIN were stolen from the mailbox. If your dad isn't willing to provide a police report to the bank, they're just going to assume he is lying. In fact, the person he filed the fraud claim with should have asked him if he had one. My bank (not BOA) requires a police report for any fraud over $5000, but really, why wouldn't he want to file one anyway?? If stuff is being stolen out of the mailbox it's technically a federal crime. Either way if the ATMs were all owned by 3rd parties the only way to pull footage is with a police report. Same with the footage at Target. \n\nI also wonder why the ATM withdrawal limit is so high... unless your father has a ton of money sitting in the bank they usually don't let you make it that high. Same with the multiple thousand dollar purchases at Target... usually they would call and verify that sort of thing. Often the 2nd time but hopefully at least the 3rd time. If my bank allowed 3 separate multiple thousand dollar transactions to go through at the same time with the same merchant, it would kind of freak me out. \n\nTBH -- I don't mean to sound harsh but this is kind of suspect. Also please understand that people file fake fraudulent claims at banks ALL THE TIME so if someone you're working with sounds insincere I'm sure it's not personal. As someone who's worked lots of fraud claims here are my immediate thoughts:\n\nIt was probably someone that knew him. Any adult or teenage kids living with them? Anyone addicted to drugs or in money trouble living with him? If someone called in to request a new card they would have needed to provide a bit of information-- stuff like DOB and verify address, etc. \n\nPerhaps he was scammed? Could someone have gotten his debit card number or bank account number from him? Maybe on a sketchy phone call or website? How old is your father? Is he pretty techy or is it possible he could be victim to a scam? Look up bail bond scams, very sad stuff. \n\nAlso - a thought occurs - his bank statement or online banking should have the location of the target. Could you possibly go there with the card and get a duplicate copy of the receipt? I wonder what they would've spent that much money on. I wonder if they were prepaid visa gift cards or something... not sure if it would help either way, just curious. \n\nI worked in banking fraud for several years so feel free to ask if you have questions. I truly wish you the best of luck!",

My suspicion is your dad got into something he is embarrassed about and did the transfers himself, but I understand my suspicions are irrelevant. \n\nI would look for a police report. Presumably he isn't going to file it on himself, and then the ATM footage. It is for sure someone that knows him well. Impossible almost otherwise. I can see an ATM or debit card skimmer but how did they get the passwords to make transfers. This is a different completely random number.\n\nI would have a serious conversation with your Dad and the bank for why they are declining. It's not done in a bubble, there is a reason behind it. Before saying they're completely liable work together to figure it out, because something extremely odd is going on. ",

I got hit 3 times within a short period of time. Full disclosure, Chase handled it and I got my money back, but everything was locked down for a few weeks which was a pain in the ass. My guess is that it was someone at the bank - how else would they have access to those accounts?\n\n\nI switched to a local bank and it's been great. I think it was just someone not getting paid enough at Chase, had the access to steal account info, and that's why they did it. With a local bank you know everyone who works there has ties to the community so even if they don't pay their workers what the big banks pay and they were a bit bitter about it, they'd be stealing from a neighbor. Plus small bank workers need *all* their customers to be happy or they wouldn't survive. Big banks don't care about one or two pissed off customers.\n\n\nWith Venmo and other internet banking services so easily accessible now days you don't need the big boys anymore.\n\n\nTLDR: switch to a small local bank.",

Get evidence backing up all the claims that you can. You want as authoritative a narrative as you can get that absolves your dad of all guilt and puts the blame squarely on BofA, and you don't want to end up with an inconsistency in your story because Uncle Bob can't remember who was where on the second Monday of whatever.\n\nAlso, get your dad to lawyer up. Maybe not put down a retainer yet - depends on how much it is for you guys - but definitely do a consult.\n\nMy last suggestion: look into going public with this. Nothing makes stuff happen faster than the threat of public embarrassment.\n\n(On a final note, BofA is probably the one national bank with the worst consumer banking rep; also, there's definitely something fishy about this story.)\n\n[edit]\n\nWhen I say \"look into\" I don't mean start tweeting and calling news stations - I literally mean look into it, i.e. ask lawyers, look up legal repercussions and what is or isn't safe to do, etc. If this ends up in court (hopefully the bofa agreement doesn't have a binding arbitration clause) you will want to be able to demonstrate good faith, and publicly shaming someone before you've exhausted all other options generally doesn't fly as good faith.",

A thief broke into a local store and replaced the point-of-sale card machine with one that skimmed the card number and stored the pin. They later broke into the store again to steal their replacement device back. Both times they also stole some items to make it look like a burglary.\n\nMonths later they created a cloned debit card and used it in a different state to withdraw $2000 on Friday, $2000 on Saturday, $2000 on Sunday and $2000 on Monday. On Friday my bank had frozen my debit card. I could not use it. The thief continued to use the cloned card for three more days though. It turns out they put a fraud hold on my checking account but the thief kept withdrawing from the savings account.\n\nI got my money back and the local police referred the matter to the FBI. I know the details of the story because the FBI caught the ring that operated this scheme months later and contacted me about it.\n\nSo yes, I know a bank that would absolutely allow four days worth of PIN-based withdraws at different locations.

Sounds to me like your dad got caught doing something shady and came up with this to cover his butt.  I mean, yes things like this can happen and I am sure they do, but at the same time the amount of holes that had to line up just right to allow this is ridiculous.  Not to mention how easy it would be for the bank to verify who made these withdrawls on camera at the atm.  If he won't file a police report, which sounds like the surest way of getting results, then he probably already knows who is at fault.\n",

The max amount per withdrawal is 500$ unless you upgrade it 700$. \n\nNot really sure how someone was able to access 4800$ from the ATM. My best bet is that they went into the teller line at different locations and made the withdrawals. Also check to see what kind of withdrawals these were. Were they transferred? Were they withdrawn? Was the money used to pay something? These are all ways that money could be debited from your account.\n\nYou should also reset your online banking details. Someone could have gotten that information and orchestrated this whole thing from online.\n\nBest thing you can do right now is to be diligent about your case and gather as much information as you can to build your case.\n",

Most likely, there is something specific they are asking for that OP's father has not provided, or the story is not the whole story. You aren't dealing with the corporate bigwigs here, you are dealing with frontline associates and their supervisors who have procedures in place to deal with this stuff because it probably happens on a daily basis. You meet their requirements, you get the money. They won't miss it, at all. This is likely why there is such a variance between the stories of people in this thread, some had trouble, some got their money back with a phone call. If something was sent to your dad's house, and his pin was used for the transactions, it is VERY unlikely that they were unauthorized transactions, from the bank's point of view.

Much of this sounds like someone who was close enough to OP's dad to know all the identifying information and order a new debit card as well as transfer funds from the savings account. The fact that the new debit card was delivered OP's father's address means it most likely was someone in the household that had ready access to the mail. Otherwise, they'd have to come up to the mail box every day to check and see if the debit card had arrived. There is a reasons why banks say 7 - 14 business days for your debit card to arrive; sometimes they will come in 3 days, other times in 10, and still other times not at all. \nI hate to say it, but much of the time it is someone close to the victim.

You don't need to be an expert to work the fraud department, you just verify the information that the computer asks you to and if anything is fishy, you get a manager involved.

The thief knew the pin and didn't need to change it\n\n3. The thief knew there were savings and checking accounts to transfer funds from savings to checking.\n\nMost legitimate frauds have nowhere near this level of depth. Why would a fraudster send the card to your house? That would require them to check the mail every day and know which envelope had the card in it. That's a tough fraud given they would have to wait for the mail every day and not get seen going through it. Second how would the fraudster know the pin to pull funds from an ATM or run such large transactions? They clearly didn't lift the info off a card reader given they had to request the new card and couldn't just make a copy. Lastly how did they know about the savings account? Most random fraudsters hitting a checking account just drain it. This fraudster supposedly contacted the bank not once but twice to get the replacement card and move the funds. Most fraudsters never contact the bank because banks catch more fraud than customers do.\n\nThink long and hard about whether someone in your family may have done this. \n\nIf this really was fraud you will need to file a police report and get an attorney. Banks are obligated to investigate for fraud and make a determination. Your case very much appears to not be fraud but instead be a family member. Hence why the bank responded the way they did. You'll need an attorney to get the money back if you're able to get it back at all.",

Like:\n\n* 2 weeks before the incident, somebody tried to access my account via a telephone number not linked to my account, failed authentication, and an alert had not been sent\n* The ATA, \"virtual teller\", allows people presenting a driver's license to access a BoA account without a debit/credit card to authenticate.  The signatures on the DL and the fake checks were not compared to the signature card on file.\n* BoA didn't pick up on the unusual activity that happened over the course of a couple of days in a location nearly 2000mi away, especially while transactions in my home area were occurring concurrently.\n* The \"virtual tellers\" didn't notice or flat-out ignored the fraud alerts that were first set on the account.\n* The \"virtual tellers\" didn't challenge anybody for a verbal password\n\nIn addition to the advice presented by everyone else (especially complain to CFPB), have your father freeze his credit reports, ex post haste.  I was told that I only had to freeze it at Experian, where TransUnion and Equifax would pick up the freeze.  I didn't trust that and filed freezes with all three.  Be sure that he gives the police report number to the credit reporting agencies to receive 7 years of fraud monitoring on his reports, regardless of the state of a freeze.\n\nIt's a shitty feeling, being left with a worn out mop and a rickety bucket to clean up after something like this.

Plus hopefully ATM footage.\n\nIn the meantime, your Dad should call back, escalate to a level 2 immediately, get an operator ID or badge number of the supervisor and explain the situation and explain he does not accept the verdict that their \"Investigation\" has concluded. That at no time did he authorize these charges, that he is appalled at the lack of thought and effort the \"investigation\" team put into his case and that they should refund the money that they allowed to be fraudulently stolen from his accounts within 3 business days. \n\nIf that supervisor isn't receptive and gives him a better answer, escalate again. If it STILL isn't resolve, have your Dad document (or document for him) including the names/badge numbers of everyone he spoke to, send it to the corporate complaints, the CFPB and the FTC.\n\n\nMore likely than not, some low-level analyst saw \"PIN-Present click button F\" on their worksheet. But this kind of fraud is not that unusual and it irritates me that your father's horrible situation was treated so nonchalantly.\n\nDid I mention I work for a Credit Union?\n\nI am confident your Dad can get this resolved with a phone call, I'm sorry he was impacted by fraud. I'm very sorry that he didn't get the correct result when he contacted the F.I. in question. ",

Not only this, but based on my experience, the back office/fraud investigation team are not operating with the clients best interest at all times. Speaking for myself at least and others I know, at the branch level employees will work harder for your best interests because you're in front of them. \n\nIf your dad goes in with the letter and speaks to the branch manager again, he'll work for your dad with the fraud team. Having a branch manager working with them should get results more so than your dad on the phone. It's just a matter getting the right person on your side. \n\nIf that leads nowhere then getting a lawyer, or even the threat of a lawyer will have this claim escalated to an area with more influence.

            "comment": "I can give you some advice that will assist you a bit more immediately, although i do recommend filing a complaint should one be warranted.\n\nI was employed at BoA as an underwriter for 4 years &amp; I left in May of this year. \n\nObviously I don't know the whole story and i'd be losing my shit if that were me so just know that i'm not defending anyone, just telling you how something like that works in there.\n\nNothing is foolproof but BoA's training is so rigorous, regular, and thorough to the point of it being like \"yes i know what a dollar bill looks like!\" (not a real example but you catch my drift) that the only way they would, in my opinion, deny your father's claim, is if it was someone who actually knows your father enough to be able to impersonate him to have enough information to pass through the wtf authentication questions they have to verify your identity. It's not \"Last 4 and DOB\" it's: \"the location and amount of your last atm withdrawal\"; your last posted statement balance; the date and amount of your last deposit; etc. Whomever this thief is would need to know and have way more access  than just basic info. Your father's identity has legit been stolen or Casey Anthony moved in next door, but the whole scenario just sounds...odd, not just bc i can't even fathom something like all of that happening but then that they wouldn't take the steps to correct it.\n\nEven as an Underwriter, i was still required to complete all of the borrower authentication, suspicious activity, red flags, elder abuse, identity theft, etc training courses 1-2x per year, even though i wasn't in a customer facing role. Bc there was even the slightest chance i could speak to a customer, i had to be informed on their security and authentication protocol. I know it doesn't seem like it but, they really REALLY are deadly serious about personal information security, customer authentication, and complaints.\n\nSo, my advice to you is this:\n\n1. File a police report and ensure you say something about possible identity theft. That amount of money is grand larceny and is a felony.\n\n2. Make sure you tell the police about Target. Target has cameras (sorry casey!). I doubt they had things shipped anywhere.\n\n3. Bring the police report to a local branch. Calmly explain the situation again to the branch manager. Bring all of the \"evidence\" you can. \n\n4. If the branch manager is absolutely zero help, then try one more branch-maybe go to a bigger city if one is close. Do the same thing.\n\n5. If they are no help, then before you leave ask/say this: \"Do you have access to the Commit-4 form?\" They'll probably be like :: stutter :: what huh yes why? Just say \"I just wanted to make sure that when you filled it out after i left, that you checked the last three boxes bc when i walk out of here, i'm doing all of it.\" If they are stupid enough to ask you what three boxes or pretend they don't know what you're talking about, then just clarify: \"Ok, well, when i'm sitting in my car i'm going to post on Twitter what a shit show this is and that BoA was careless with my father's identity to the point where an unknown person drained his bank account after stealing his debit card, and they actually denied his claim to get his money back! (1-Customer says they are going to post on social media); and then when i get home, i'll be contacting channel 9 for them to start an investigation bc in SURE our little news team would love to break a story about BoA similar to the Wells Fargo one that was just out (2-Customer says they plan on contacting news outlets); and then i'll be submitting complaints to the local PD, the FTC, FDIC, and CFPB (3-Customer threatens regulatory action)\" \n\nthese are all y/n questions they are required to answer any time a customer has ANY KIND OF COMPLAINT. So, if a customer says \"man, you guys never have new bills\" - it's required to be filed as a customer dissatisfaction. those and the complaints are logged and tracked extremely closely and there is an entire (american) team who's sole purpose is to review the complaints and, given the severity either keep hounding whoever is supposed to follow up with the solution or, if RED ALERT THIS IS NOT A DRILL (i.e. answering yes to any of the ?s above) that would be escalated to Brian Moynihan probably and I would bet money that you'd get a phone call from a VIP either that day or within 24 hours....but they'll do whatever to make it right.\n\nOne more thing: Every phone call is actually recorded and monitored in addition to the screens being recorded while a call is active. They have probably already done this as part of their investigation but your father may be able to call and request he listen to it. I also recommend him placing an extended alert on his credit reports, in addition to freezing them for the next 60 days to ensure this person doesn't start opening cards in his name, etc. A credit freeze is just that, it freezes your report so if someone tries to check it to open up new credit it doesn't let them bc...no scores. \n\nLet me know if i can help or if you have any other questions.\n\n",

I demand my 10k be given back to me as I was not the one who took it. \n\nNot saying your father did this obviously, but just understand the bank cannot simply take every fraud story as fact on first glance. Once they set a precedent and do it for one, if someone imitates the same scenario they are obligated to do it for the next. \n\nDon't give up, they aren't trying to screw you, just trying not to get screwed.

            "comment": "Source: I've been a bank branch manager for years. \n\nThis is likely caused by one of a few issues. \n\n1. The bank was confused about the claim.  Usually the people making the decisions never speak to the individual involved (your dad) directly. The claim may have been confused or lost in translation.  \n\nFor example: If the bank employee submits a claim A instead of a claim B, the claim couldn't be switched over to B later.  The claim would be denied.  \n\nYou said he filed the claim a second time though; this leads me to believe any confusion would have been resolved. \n\n\n2.  After the initial claim submission (via branch or 24 hour phone line), you are sent physical paper documents.   A few community banks do them digitally, but it is uncommon.  These documents are used to legally \"get your side\" of the story, and then to get your signature binding you to it.  Banks also use this to catch scammers and liars in case their story changes.  \nThere are legal deadlines around this process, and it is very regulated by the government.  If your dad did not complete and return the documents within the legal time period, his claim would be denied. \n\nIf that was the case, it would explain the multiple claims getting denied.\n\n\n3.  Finally, and I hate to say it, but the bank may have determined your dad was trying to scam them in some manner.  Maybe your dad is lying to your family about this.\n\nI literally see scammer fraud claims almost daily.  Your dad may have been scamming the bank, had his claim denied, and now he's fucked.  If that was the case, he couldn't tell his family about it, could he?  He'd have to lie to them, and then ride the lie all the way down.\n\nIs your dad eager to get the law involved?   If he was legitimately robbed and the bank is not covering the claim, then you DEFINITELY  want to get a lawyer and the media involved.  That being said, there's no reason for the bank to deny a legitimate claim. The FDIC insures your account for $250,000.  If it's a legitimate claim, the bank will simply pass the bill on to the FDIC.  Furthermore, banks always encourage you to file a police report about the incident. Has your father done that?  It legitimizes the whole process.\n\n\nRemember:\n- Not all atms have cameras (think gas station atms).  Bank ones do, and banks share info. \n- The Target purchases were either online (police easily track delivery address and IP info) or in person. \n- In many cases, VISA or MasterCard is forced to cover the loss of card transactions.\n- $9800 is a suspicious withdrawal amount in bank land.  Cash transactions of $10,000 or more are regulated closely, and require the bank to record your ID.  This may not apply in your case, but it might. \n- Most atms will not give $2,000 out in one go.  Most cards require at LEAST one business day to update the daily limit. \n-  most banks ask basic info to identify you over the phone.  This is probably the weakest security the bank provides.  Customers want to be able to call in not knowing their own account details and still get help.  Banks had to develop shitty and insufficient methods to identify you.  It is entirely possible that someone familiar with your dads info called in and passed the tests. Then the bank WOULD be \"allowed\" to help and send new cards and such. \n\n\nAll of this to summarize, banks usually only \"eat\" a loss if it's a bank error or when a customer doesn't pay a debt.  They set aside a lot of money for this each quarter.  Your dad's 10k isn't enough to make the bank risk the fines and ratings damage.  The bank has little to gain, but much to lose by denying a legitimate claim.  Banks spend a lot of money to get this right, so I'd start considering your source.  Again, no disrespect intended.  I have to give advice like this at work all the time.  It sucks. \n\n\nGood luck friend. ",

After he logged in, he saw that his funds had been returned and the messages stated that his subsequent follow up claims had been approved.\nThe next step is to find out from BofA and exactly what information the perpetrator had that allowed them to request a new debit card from BofA to be mailed to my dad's address. I saw a lot of comments that asked why my dad didn't file a police report, but he did! I realize that the first post was a huge block of text, but I did mention that he filed a police report. It's just buried in that text. A lot of people also mentioned that it might be someone close to him such a a family member, but this is pretty much impossible. My mom and dad immigrated to the US over 30 years ago, so we actually don't have any other family members here, as the rest of the extended family is overseas. I'm their only child and I live on the west coast while they still live in NY. I also doubt that they fell into bad company because they are some of the most straight laced boring people you'll ever meet, lol. They don't drink, gamble, smoke, etc. In any case, the next step is definitely to figure out how this happened in the first place.

It would be a nightmare.  All banks would go out of business the same day.\n\nClearly they can't just take somebody's word for it.  There does need to be an investigation and an attempt to prove that he didn't do it and other people who know him and who will split the money with him didn't do it.\n\nIf he bought a thing in your city with it and then 5 min later a thief charges something in another state, that's pretty good proof that there might be criminal activity involved.  It would be helpful if you didn't live in New York since that's where the transactions are from.\n\nIf all the charges are within a short distance of your house, that's different.  That points toward it being an inside job.  Maybe not, but it's more likely.\n\nAgain, it's a good move here to do everything with CCs, because if a CC is run up you can just refuse to pay it and the bank has to take the loss.  The banks are much more motivated to process this kind of thing to your benefit.  \n\nTransactions are much easier to reverse also with CCs because they tend not to settle immediately against your cash, unlike debit cards.  It takes time to get through the system and that gives more time to undo stuff.\n\nYour best bet atm is to again prove you didn't do it and try hard to keep harassing the bank about it.",

Then they made 4x$600 at like 11pm on the night of November 1st and then another 4x$600 after midnight, in the wee hours of November 2nd.  My day got a letter in the mail a few days later stating that his account withdrawal allowance has been increased to $2400 a day.  By the time the letter arrived, the money was already gone.\n\nI have no idea how any of this is even possible.  I would think that they need to answer security questions in order to increase the limit as well as request a new debit card.  Also, I would think that the calls need to be made from a home phone or listed cell phone.  We asked the bank agent all of these questions and they have not been forthcoming with information!",

Especially if he is cognizant enough to realize he's fallen prey to a scam, he might be embarrassed or confused and unwilling to admit to something he did. Again, not jumping to conclusions here, just giving you another angle to consider. ",

            "comment": "Hi, I might be late to this but here goes. \n\nIt sounds like your father may have suffered account takeover fraud. First thing to do is check the address that the bank has for your father. \n\nNext check all details that other banking institutions hold to ensure there has been no other accounts compromised. \n\nYou may also want to check that no lines of credit have been opened in your father's name. \n\nIf the address details have been changed, it is important to find out when and how. This is where the fraud has primarily taken place. \n\nIf the address details have not been changed you'll need to ensure the crime details are recorded correctly with the correct agency. In the US it is a federal crime AFAIK. \n\nI know you'll be focused on the money, but find the compromise and this will then support the fraud. \n\nThe difficulty with chip and pin is that it is very secure up until your account is compromised. This will be the basis for the rejection of the claim. \n\nKeep in mind that this is not a failing of the bank staff, you'll need to get them onside so they go above and beyond for you. Shouting and getting angry will be counter productive for you and your father. \n\nIf you feel they are not prepared to take the claims seriously, or start stonewalling, request a copy of the complaints procedure. This should be supplied in the terms and conditions of holding an account. Also find out what ombudsman you can escalate a complaint to. \n",

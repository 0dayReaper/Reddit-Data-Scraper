I don't know how much she needs to pay, but I wanna cover it up to $13,000.\n\nMy priority is keeping her away from Sallie Mae and Navient. I'm not currently willing to commit to contributing that much per year though. \n\nHow do I do it?",

They will ask how much untaxed income she received during the applicable year and that will greatly diminish any non-loan based aid she's eligible for. Found that out the hard way when I was in college. It would have been better to not accept any money, take the scholarships/grants and then in my senior year received the money to pay off any loans.\n\nIt's something parents don't usually consider when opening a 529 plan for their child. The FAFSA always lagged behind based on the previous tax year I think so when the 529 funds run out you're left holding the bag on the next application.",

I would suggest paying something like 4k a year. She may have more scholarships the first year or two than the last year or two so the need maybe greater later. Maybe talk to her or her parents and see what her needs are. Maybe it will be better to help her later when her parents money starts to run out. \n\nDo not transfer this money to her or her parents.

Tell her she\u2019s got 13k to use and think about where it could be used best. \n\nI\u2019m not sure about people saying how you should set this aside in a high-yield savings account.

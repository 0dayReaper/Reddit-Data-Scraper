    "postText": "Bought our brand new home in 2020. 4/3 single story on 3/4 acre. Fenced yard, above ground pool, desirable area with good schools. Area is growing. \n\nPurchase for $350k. Owe $290k. Can probably sell for $420-440k. My mortgage, including taxes, is currently $1577/mth. Can probably get $2800-$3000+ for rent. We live in northern Louisiana (came here for work originally, now have work from home job with top tech company). Affords me the luxury of living anywhere. We have zero debt other than our mortgage and mortgage be car payment. More than enough savings and could float this mortgage and a new one, but would prefer that is the exception it the norm. \n\nMoving back to Chicago area to be close to family in Nov/Dec. Been away 20 years (military and government work) and parents aren\u2019t getting any younger. \n\nAm I crazy to sell or should I rent it out? Have a great friend down here that owns probably 25-30 properties of his own that would watch my property like a hawk. \n\nLittle concerned because I\u2019ve rented a precious home in the past with about a 66% success rate. Two great, immaculate renters.  3rd were slobs. \n\nHouse has top appliances, no needs, and built by high end builder. It\u2019s currently in pristine condition. \n\nWould consider including things like pool, lawn/garden, and pest maintenance just to ensure it is maintained properly.  \n\nLooking for that Reddit advice to convince me one way or another.",

If you can sell a property you just built 3 years ago for more than it cost, take your money and run.\n\nManaging a property from out of state is very difficult.  Also, $3k monthly rent on a property worth $400k+ isn\u2019t great.\n\nI would sell it, and plow the equity into your new home, since that mortgage will certainly be at a much higher interest rate.",

Just collect cash flow and not worry about maintenance? Or do you want to sell and redeploy the money else where? \n\n\nNumber 3 should determine what you do with it. Number 2 will determine your options with it. And number 1 will help determine who would want it. \n\nLet me know, happy to help",

But re-graded and re-sodded the whole back yard and installed French drains to include tying in our gutters to the drains. eliminated all water problems. \n\nYea, VA loan. I have enough second tier entitlement to cover what we\u2019ll need when we move. Also VA disabled, so no funding fee. \n\nLong term goals are just to not miss out on financial opportunities. Hold it, cash flow it, and sell it at some point down the road. We don\u2019t really have any desire to return or live in Louisiana again. Just seems like I can continue building equity in a very positive light.",

And once you've converted it to a rental property, it opens the door to the 1031 exchange which basically means you can defer capital gains tax indefinitely, not that it would matter that much regardless even if you sold up.\n\nThe question from a financial perspective is if you can generate the kind of returns that renting out the house would on \\~$110k cash ($420k sales price less $290k mortgage payoff less 6% RE commissions).",

No renter is going to take care of the place the way you would, so expect to be disappointed when their dog destroys the high end kitchen cabinets or chews out the custom door jambs. \n\nIn your position, I would sell and drill the equity into the new place up North. By the description, it sounds like it will sell quickly and for a premium if it's truly in move-in condition.\n\nAlso, consider flipping the script - could you build an ADU and have your parents move down closer to you?",

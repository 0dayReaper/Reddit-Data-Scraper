    "postText": "Hi all,  If this question has been asked before, I apologize:\n\n\\- I have found a good Financial Advisor whom I got the firm from a recommendation and there are no red-flags that I could see from my google searching on the firm or key personnel.\n- I have my stuff currently on various platforms (and I am aiming for  simpler investment strategy with this advisor).  \n\n- To use them, I need to transfer my current assets to Charles Schwab because that is the custodian this firm uses.  That is fine by me and Schwab is a reputable advisor.\n\n- I will be transferring a good amount of money for the firm to manage so I want to ensure I do whatever I can / should do to protect it.\n\n- As I am signing documents as they become my advisor, are there any steps I should be thinking of to mitigate fraud?  While I have a personal recommendation, I don't know this firm. Lets say there is a bad actor at the firm - can they transfer my assets out of my name without me knowing and then live forever in Tahiti, screwing me over?   If anyone has any advice or links to this, I would love to hear them.   I have been told I am being overly paranoid because if they are using a reputable custodian then it would be very difficult to transfer assets to any accounts out of my name.   On the other hand, if they need to trade my existing assets to create my new portfolio, wont they need access to my accounts?   Or can they only transfer assets to other accounts in my name only?\n\nThank you for any tips or advice!",

Or it can be accomplished with one fund (total world index).\n\nI used to have an advisor.  But once I saw the light (realized the advisor just added complexity *and* I had to pay for this complexity), I went with the Boglehead path.",

I had a look at the website - but not sure I follow that it covers the situation as follows (as a hypothetical):\n\n\\- Financial advisor has access to my funds on the Schwab platform.   Is there a way to ensure any trades are only done to accounts in my name so that he can't do a trade of say $250K to Joe Bloggs account?   If I have this risk, is there a way to mitigate it at all?   Many thanks again.",

To what degree this goes to can sometimes be debatable.\n\nBut if there is outright fraud, embezzlement, theft, etc, then FINRA is the government enforcement agency.\n\nDirectly from the link:\n\n* We act quickly to identify misconduct, stop fraud and prevent losses, obtain restitution for harmed investors and remove bad actors from the brokerage industry.\n\n* We dedicate our resources to bringing meaningful enforcement actions to correct wrongdoing and deter future misconduct and to rooting out the bad actors that pose the greatest risk of harm to investors and the markets.\n\nYour advisor's license to be a broker would be pulled, fines levied, and evidence furnished to whatever appropriate governmental attorneys.",

And it may be that my fears are overrated.   So hopefully a better schenario:\n\n\\- all my funds are now with Charles Schwab after I transferred them to that custodian.   I no longer have any funds with any other custodian;\n\n\\- my new financial adviser (Joe Bloggs) is managing my portfolio at Charles Sshwab.   As my portfolio hits, say, $5m, what is to stop him (or someone working for him) taking the entire amount of my portfolio out of Charles Schwab, putting it into his account and then running away to Brazil?   I have heard that this is not possible because financial advisors cannot move amounts around and deposit them into accounts other than accounts that are in my name.   So I understand that the downside for him is that he would be ruined per your last paragraph - but if he is sitting pretty in Brazil with $5m, he probably doesn't care, right?   \n\n\\- Hopefully I am overthinking and overworrying this.   I guess that if the principle is diversify your assets, am I (is everyone that has 1 financial advisor) consolidating too much by only using 1 financial advisor?   Or do the custodians limit what can be done (in terms of where the financial advisor can transfer funds) such that this is not really a risk and I should just relax :)\n\nThanks again - really appreciate the input - the FINRA stuff is very helpful!",

What's stopping any random joe shmoe from claiming they're a Doctor?  Your State Medical Board.\n\nHow do you know your Doctor isn't crazy and won't give you wacky tests/diagnostics?\n\nYour State Medical Board can levy punishment.\n\nCould your Doctor do an unnecessary surgery on you and then run off to North Korea, escaping punishment?\n\nWell... okay... sure... but then the \"Doctor\" would have to live in North Korea.\n\n&gt; I have heard that this is not possible because financial advisors cannot move amounts around and deposit them into accounts other than accounts that are in my name.

Investing does not have to be difficult.  It can be easy.\n\nBut if you insist on using an advisor, I would consider \"buying\" a plan from the advisor and executing it myself.  In other words, I ensure that the advisor does not have secondary motivations because the advisor has no control *and* is not paid a % of my assets.  I pay the advisor based on time/package.  I pay the advisor only for the \"plan.\"\n\nBut if you choose to hand over control to your advisor, then you must have some degree of trust/faith in your advisor.  Otherwise, you really really really should not proceed.\n\n&gt; Or do the custodians limit what can be done (in terms of where the financial advisor can transfer funds) such that this is not really a risk and I should just relax :)\n\nYou should just relax.  There are much higher yield endeavors to take on.\n \n&gt; Thanks again - really appreciate the input - the FINRA stuff is very helpful!",

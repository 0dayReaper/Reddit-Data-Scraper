    "postText": "I saw some apartments that I could apply for online that, with a 12mo lease, cost around $1150/mo. But when I went to tour the place in person they said the lowest they had was like $1275? I get that prices change daily but if I applied for one online at that price are they just going to change the price on me at take the $50 application fee?",

If you're putting in an application for a specific unit and paid the app fee, the market rate is based on what it was the day you applied.\nIf it's a general application the $1275 might be all that's available at the time. The online listed price could be outdated or the starting range for that style you want.\n\n Also, definitely ask about the price listed. I had a complex try to upsell me at the tour and I wasn't backing down. If they can't or won't budge on the rent, ask to have the app fee waived if you sign. Some companies have more price flexibility than others.",

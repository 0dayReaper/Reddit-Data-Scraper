    "postText": "A number of years ago (2018) I inherited a 401k from my family and was identifed as a beneficiary of said account with my sibling. We decided to split this account and moved on with our lives no problem. The intention was to remove any dependency from our parents and have our accounts with our names as sole owners. Through the next few years automatic RMD distrubuted small amts each year until the pandemic came around. I don't remember and RMD in 2021 or 2022 for that matter so I questioned myself, did I forget or is there a pause I'm not realizing?\n\nSo today I decided to give Fedility a call and had to wait a very long time before I finally got to their retirement account department. When I did reach a representative they informed me that since I didn't take an RMD in 2019 (which I do remember receiving but can't prove right at the moment. I even remember Fedility giving me calls to take RMDs between 2018 &amp; 2019 at end of year)  that too much time has passed which has accelerated this IRA-BDA account from a distribution horizon of my lifetime (which they said on the call) to a 5 yr horizon ending in tax yr 2024. I was really surprised to find this out today but I'm also not sure how to proceed, the balance on this account is roughly 77k.\n\nAs I decided to lurk here on the PF subredit reading other various redditors PF questions, taking a look at the suggested readings and advice etc, I've finally come to one of mine own and I'm in need of your help for any advice or direction on this IRA-BDA?\n\nPF can you help me out? Thanks for any advice given.",

You might possibly try to take just the missed RMDs and see if the IRS will waive the 50% tax penalty, but there's no guarantee of that.",

Is it there any harm in taking the lump sum instead?",

I was surprised after ending the call since it sounds like they didn't know but insisted I speak with a tax professional. \n\nThis became a 2 prong issue, RMDs from previous yrs are possibly taxed at 50% and now this accelerated timeline for which this account must be depleted by. \n\nHas anyone else ever experience an issue like this and has it worked out well or not?",

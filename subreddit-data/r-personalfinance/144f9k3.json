    "postText": "Hi! Recent college graduate here with a 750 credit score and job starting in September ($110k salary + bonus). I don\u2019t have any debts or other recurring expenses but will be paying $1400 in rent starting in August. I\u2019m looking to buy a car and am unsure of how much I should sign myself up for or if leasing would be better. I currently have my eyes on a new Ford Bronco and they\u2019re finally going for under MSRP in my area ranging from $40-45k. Is that a feasible idea?\n\nWould I even be eligible to finance a car right now? If my dad were to co-sign it, how would it impact each of our credit scores and history? I can put down a 10% down payment right now and can afford payments until I start working. Ford\u2019s also offering 5.99% apr (unsure if a local credit union, etc. would be better). Thank you! Wrapping my head around the world of personal finance has been harrowing and any help or advice is very appreciated.",

            "comment": "A general rule I like for buying cars is 20/3/8 (from the Money Guy show, which I highly recommend) - 20% down, pay it off in 3 years, and monthly payments don't exceed 8% of your gross monthly salary. Based on that, you can't afford this car.\n\nYou probably don't need a co-signer as you have good credit and likely don't have too much debt. If you ever find yourself in a position where you *need* a co-signer, chances are you can't afford whatever it is you're trying to buy",

What happens if they rescind the offer or the job doesn't work out? You're left with a payment that's going to be $600-$800 per month and no job.\n\nThe used market is now receding and deals can be had. Buy something used that costs $25k max and upgrade in a couple of years once you're actually financially stable. \n\nAnd finance deals are horrific right now. 6% is historically crap and you'd be mad to pay that when in two years from now they're likely going to be markedly lower. You're literally paying more now than in the last 20 years.",

Buy a cheaper car, save up from your job for at least a year, then we can consider this car if you still want it. \n\nYou're fresh out of college, I bet you have no emergency savings or anything, that needs to be step 1. Then  track your purchases and find out what per month your lifestyle is going to demand, while beginning contributions to retirement. Once that's all figured out, we'll know what is and isn't in budget for a car.",

            "comment": "Leasing would be a bad idea. If the job doesn't work out, you're stuck with a bill that is really hard to discharge. At least if you buy a car you could sell it.\n\nDepending on taxes and deprecation after purchase - you could end up underwater with your plan, and that would be a terrible idea. Also, at over 5% interest rate, I consider a purchase that's not strictly necessary to be a mistake to finance. This means looking at the cheapest possible car that would fit your needs and being able to pay the difference between the two. Broncos are pretty cool, but with only 4.5k to put down on it, I think you're pushing too far on the budget with this. \n\n114k is an awesome salary, but I would budget for 50-60k (average salary) in case the job doesn't work out, for anything that results in long term payment commitments.",

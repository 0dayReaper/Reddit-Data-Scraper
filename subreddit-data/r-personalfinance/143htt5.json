    "postText": "Hi, 44M married with a kid. Was unemployed for almost a year and recently landed a part time job making $35/hour about 20 hours a week. However, during my period of unemployment I racked up credit card debt and have become 30-60 days late on all 7 credit cards. My credit score is in the low 500s. I recently received a gift of around $10k and may receive some more in a few months. \n\nMy question is since my score is already so low and the debt is high and already showing 30-60 days late on my credit reports what is my best strategy to handle this amount of debt? I would like to bring my score back up, also budgeting issues aside... Should I just let them charge off my credit cards and then ask to settle the debts? Do a hardship program? Bankruptcy? I don't know if I will receive a another lump sum in the future...Any and all help appreciated. Thanks!",

The damage has already been done.\n\nIf you stopped paying all the cards and went to settle them in a year, you might be able to do it with the $10k but also keep in mind, you'll get a 1099 form for the $30k difference which is taxable income so you'll have to pay taxes on that.",

Just depends on how much you're willing to spend to make it go away.  The debt will get passed around from creditor to creditor.  You might get harassed, you might not.  They might even send you legal-ish threatening letters \"From the desk of Blah Blah - Attorney at Law\" in an attempt to scare you.\n\nWhen you're ready to settle, you pull your credit from annual credit report and verify the creditor and the account number of the debt.  Contact the creditor about the debt and ask for written notice of proof of the debt. Once they provide it, tell them you have some cash saved and would like to settle the debt.  When you've agreed on a number, you have them send you an offer letter in-writing confirming that such-and-such amount will satisfy the debt.  You then in turn get a cashiers check or money order and return it back certified mail. When its received, you then get a satisfaction letter from them.\n\n* Don't give them your bank details\n* Dont get set up with a payment plan\n* Don't lead them on that you might have more money coming in.\n* Tell them you've got other people on your ass and if they dont want to settle today, you'll pay off another bill and the company will have to wait until beloved Aunt Beatrice dies and can leave you some more money to pay the next one off.",

You pay them, generally a little more than what they were willing to take, in exchange for them removing the bad debt entirely from your credit report. They may balk at it and you have to get it in writing, but it goes a very long way towards fixing your credit",

First do what you can to find a job and an income that will give you above and beyond your minimum you need to live.  Then focus on the highest debt, highest interest cards first, paying more than the minimum and/or make payments whenever you can afford to pay more.  When that card is paid off, put that payment towards the next highest card, etc... until they are all paid off.\n\nIf I had it to do over again I would have just declared bankruptcy though.  I had these balances for years and the CC card companies got more in interest than I charged at the end.  None of them would give me a break and that royally pissed me off.  Some cards will work with debt relief some won't.  The ones I had wouldn't. I do feel proud I paid them off though, but it's set me behind on retirement 10-15 years.",

Paying off $1k a month between 2 cards, about $5.6k of it is on a third card that won\u2019t start having interest accruing until Dec 2024. $1k does not include charged interest which I am also paying. \n\nI\u2019ve maybe had 3 payments bounce when I first was in debt because originally I was paying full balance until I stopped doing that (I know - stupid. I was living within my means then stopped but whatever). Rent is $1.7k per month. Live by myself, no kids, in august I\u2019ll have a $500 ish student loan payment per month going. My take home per month is about $5k (before expenses)\n\nBudgeting wise I know I\u2019ll get there within a couple years so I\u2019m not super worried overall as long as I don\u2019t change my habits. \n\nAny advice on getting a personal loan? I really would prefer this, and then I will just discontinue use of my credit cards (what I am already doing) until the debt is gone. With the loan that way I can just have my monthly payment automatic and consider that money gone and eventually the loans will be gone. \n\nI also have around $20k in stocks, I know selling them is not the right idea for long term thinking but it would allow me to discharge the debt.\n\nHappy to provide more info or maybe I should just make my own post.",

Because you may be okay for a while, but if you're only working 20 hours a week, you're going to end up sinking again once that $10k runs out.  It really doesn't matter what other steps you may do, if you can't start regularly earning enough to cover your expenses plus debts.  \n\nOther than that, start using the money you have to start bringing your accounts current (not late), and then maintain at least minimum payments from there.  Your credit score will recover over time.  At only 30-60 days late (as opposed to 90+), it's still at the point where it is recoverable.  No need to really go nuclear yet.  Beyond that general advice I'm not sure what else could be recommended specifically since you didn't provide any details, so it's kind of impossible to judge if debt consolidation or other options may be worth considering.  \n  \nBut really, your number one priority above all else should be:  Full employment, right away.",

He needs to quit using the CCs as much as possible and start paying them down aggressively, starting with the one that has the highest interest rate.\n\nBankruptcy doesn't just magically delete your debt, usually they end up making you sell all your assets or garnish your wages until you pay back most of what you owe, THEN you have that on your credit report for 7-10 years, AND it's still searchable in public records. If he's worried about his credit score, that indicates to me that he wants to borrow sometime in the future, Bankruptcy will make that much more difficult.\n\nHe owes $40k and is about to get $10k. That will pay off 25% of his cards. He also stated that he may be gifted more money in the future. Even making $35/hr at 20hr a week would let him pay about $1k a month, give or take. If he ups his hours or finds a second job, he can pay this off in like 3-4 years if he plays it right.\n\nBankruptcy, settling credit card debt, closing accounts out are all guaranteed ways to fuck yourself and really shouldn't be done unless it's absolutely impossible to pay what you owe and/or you just got served papers and are getting sued. This guy is in a rough spot but far from an impossible situation.",

You can only exempt $35k in equity in your home and up to 5 acres in a city, 200 acres in rural areas. You are only exempt for $7500 towards an automobile. There are a few other exemptions but the majority of things you own can be sold to pay the debts.\n\nBankruptcy DOES NOT just make your debt vanish, otherwise what would stop people from just racking up debt and canceling it. Some states do have higher exemptions for homes and vehicles, so while giving advice, it's something to consider. \n\nAlso the guy stated he wants to up his credit score. Bankruptcy is not the way to do that. He literally only needs to pay 2 grand a month for 19 months to fix his problem, he doesn't need to blow his life up over this and fuck his credit and ability to get loans at a good rate for years and years!",

As others have said, getting up to full employment is priority one. \nIf you let 7 creditors go delinquent for more than 12 months, aka walk away from the debt, I\u2019d put the odds of you getting sued by one of those creditors at 90-100%. If we were talking $1000 or $2000 they probably wouldn\u2019t litigate, but for a piece of 40k, someone will sue. There will be a summary judgement and you will have some type of garnishment put in place. \nWork with your creditors directly. They won\u2019t charge it off until you\u2019re at 90 days past due in most cases. Banks would rather get something rather then nothing. If the creditor\u2019s terms are unacceptable, you may have to contact consumer credit counseling and work with them, or someone they refer",

            "comment": "I made a post under another comment but wanted to put this in its own thread.\n\nContrary to what most of these comments say, DO NOT DECLARE BANKRUPTCY, DO NOT CLOSE ANY ACCOUNTS, DO NOT USE A DEBT CONSOLIDATION SERVICE, DO NOT SETTLE ANY DEBTS. At 44 years old, by taking any of those options, you're guaranteed to have a really hard time getting more credit or loans until you're in your mid 50's.\n\nMost debt consolidation companies are scams, and the few that aren't don't really do much you can't do yourself. Many times, what these companies do is close all your accounts and try to settle the debt for less. By doing this, it'll tank your credit and make it close to impossible to get an unsecured line of credit for years and years. If that did happen to be the route you want to take, you can do that without a middleman.\n\nSettling debt or closing accounts will hurt you much more than it will help. You commented that you want to have a good credit score, settling or closing accounts pretty much burns your relationship with your banks/creditors and they probably will not let you open a new account in the future. You will also erase your credit history closing accounts, not good. A factor in credit scores is the age of your oldest accounts. When you try to take out loans, having a settled account or multiple closed revolving lines of credit make you look really bad to lenders.\n\nBankruptcy is flat out a bad choice. Depending on your state, they may make you sell everything you own, garnish your wages, and having a Bankruptcy on your credit report will follow you for a decade, possibly even longer if your lenders look at records outside of your credit report. You aren't deep enough in the hole to take this route. People on here are acting like bankruptcy is the magic bullet to erase all your debt. All it does is stops interest from accumulating and prevents you from getting sued. You dont have a single charged off account, no one is threatening legal action against you, you are fine. Bankruptcy shouldn't ever be a resort unless you've gotten served papers to appear in court over a debt, or if you owe an impossible amount, like $200k when you earn $30k a year.\n\nHere's the plan. You are about to get a $10k gift. Pay the minimums on all your cards, make sure you pay any cards that are over the limit, and pay down whatever card has the highest interest rates first. Congratulations, you just paid off 25% of your debt. Your credit score should go up a good bit from this, credit to debt ratio is the largest factor on your credit report, along with ontime payments. This leaves you with $30k. \n\nIf you owe $30k at 28% APR, you can pay that down in full by putting $2k a month towards your debt, AND YOU WILL BR ZEROED OUT IN 19 MONTHS! Not only will you be debt free, but you will probably end up with a good credit score by doing this. Those late marks aren't great, but if you never miss another payment, they will matter less and less over time. Never miss a minimum payment. If you take the nuclear option and settle these debts or do bankruptcy, you will be feeling the effects fot a decade. Buckling down for a year and 7 months isn't a bad deal. If you have a job that pays $35/hr, up your hours. If that isn't possible, you can get a side job like uber, bartending/serving, data entry, whatever you need to do. I feel like between you and your wife, yall can figure out how to budget and make that work. You also mentioned that you may have more gifts coming your way. Don't depend on them, but know that they will help you out a lot.\n\nAnother cool thing is that once you start paying stuff off, your credit will start bouncing back, and that will open up the possibility of getting 0% Apr cards and personal loans. Use these if you need to, but remember that if you aren't careful, you can sink yourself into an even deeper hole using these products.\n\nAs you pay your cards down, pretend that they don't exist. As in, do not use them unless it's an absolute emergency. Pay everything as you go, do not rack up more debt. If you can't stop spending, then literally cut up the cards or don't carry them in your wallet. Some companies even allow you to freeze your card without closing the accounts. DO NOT CLOSE any accounts! Keep them open and don't use them, put a low cost recurring charge like Netflix on your unused accounts so they don't get closed for inactivity.\n\nI know it's rough now, but you're in a very manageable situation that you can come out of in 1-4 years.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention, never never never allow your accounts to get chaged off! That's the first step to getting sued. Sometimes companies will settle, sometimes they tell you tough shit and take you to court. Besides a bankruptcy, a chargeoff is one of the worst things for your credit. It's the lenders saying \"we don't trust that this person will ever pay us back.\" It's worse that even being in collections.\n\nEdit 2: yall down vote away! Go check out the forums at myfico.com if you want real advice. This sub is obviously filled with people who have never navigated this situation.",

            "comment": "Don't worry about your credit score unless you are looking to go into a job in the financial sector, credit checks are something they do and poor credit will often disqualify you from a job. That said, you didn't mention if you have a home or savings in a brokerage account, if you have either there are some loan options available to you that would allow you to pay off the debt and pay at a significantly lower rate, I'm guessing your APR is somewhere in the 20%+ range and a HELOC or Line of Credit based on assets in a brokerage account will come in more like 6-10% depending on who is underwriting the loan and just how bad your current credit score is. Paying down that loan will also help to cure your bad credit rating. \n\nYou can also look to move that balance to a new credit card with low or no interest rate for a period of time, this will at least give you some relief on the interest until you figure out a path to pay it off.\n\nAnother option is open to you if you have a 401k from a previous employer and are now employeed as a 1099  if you are a contractor. If that is the case you can convert the account to a Solo 401(k) which allows you to withdraw tax and penalty free unlike a standard IRA or 401k where you will pay a 10%+ penalty to withdraw early and pay the taxes owed. These are meant for entrepreneurs but if you are a 1099 contractor, as opposed to a W2, you are technically self-employed and this could be an option.\n\nTrying to settle with the credit card companies will take a very heavy toll on your credit score and it takes a long time to build that back up, in some cases 10+ years, something you need to seriously consider if you are ever looking to take a loan to buy a home, car, or anything else for that matter. Good luck, getting debt free is not easy but you will feel an incredible sense of freedom when you finally do.",

It\u2019s worth it to let them handle everything and you can see the payment amounts, the scheduled payments and interest rates. You can also still log in to your accounts to verify they\u2019re making the payments they say they\u2019re making. You can also make extra payments to the accounts directly if you have extra money. I was worried my credit score would tank when they closed all of my credit cards, but it didn\u2019t (plus it helped that I didn\u2019t have cards and stopped accruing debt).

Perhaps see if you can get a balance transfer card to free up space on a couple of your best cards - cash-back for example, and pay them off monthly. \n\nI\u2019ve been there and dug out doing the above and following other advice posted.

Most credit dings for late payments can be explained away for unemployment. Just make a note on your credit reports about your unemployment.

Call each credit card company directly, explain your situation and ask for a forbearance or hardship program. 9 out of 10 will work with you and offer everything from lower interest rate to 0% in exchange for closing your acct.\n2. Engage Credit Guard America (I'm sure there are other companies as well). They will work out a lower interest payment plan and collect a lump sum payment from you to disburse to the credit card companies.\nIn both options you will lost the credit cards but will be able to recover over time. You always have the option of keeping one low interest card back for emergencies and not turning it over to CGA.\n\nGood Luck",

Trim down any spending to the bare minimum. Snowball the credit cards starting with the smallest balance (or highest interest, your choice, some people like highest interest first but I prefer small balance to SEE results).  This is your mess, you clean it up bud. Working part time? What the heck? I don't even understand the mindset. What were you doing during a year of unemployment? For context, we have a home repair bill of about 40k+. We both work full time already but my husband did not want to spend 10 years paying it off so he took a second job. Working weekends, 12 hour shifts. We have paid down 25k Since December 2022. We have about 18k left! It will be paid off by end of summer if we are diligent. Sacrifices are being made. This is my advice.",

This will likely take 10+ years to clear at an extremely unfavorable interest rate.  \n\nHigher interest first is objectively better, you pay less money in the long run.  Dave Ramsey is a quack for telling people to focus on balances.  It makes no sense and there are several better options outside of paying down the smallest balances first.  \n\nLowering the interest rate is an option.  If they feel they must own the debt then consolidating into a loan at a lower rate and shorter term is a good option.  Could end up getting away with paying $6k interest instead of $40k+.  Whether that is advisable largely depends on how the balance was racked up in the first place.\n\nAlternatively if they really need to hold on to that debt they could transfer everything they can to 0% APR cards while setting up automatic payments to clear the balance by the end of the term.  Then throw everything else at the highest interest rate.  \n\nOP is probably paying around 27% APR.  If they put $966/mo towards that they will clear the balance in 10 years on the dot.  That will come with a bill of $76,000 in interest alone for a total payout of $116,000.\n\nIf they consolidate to a personal loan they will get a much better rate.  At 9% they can pay that off in 5 years paying $830/mo.  Interest makes up $9800 for a total payout of $49,800.  \n\nTo me it really comes down to what is in the near future for OP.  If they don't have a major salary increase on the horizon and they aren't looking to buy a new home or car this decade then bankruptcy is the most financially prudent option imo.",

Nobody is giving this guy a 0% credit card with the credit score and past due payments he already has. I realize that my line of thought is not the \"norm\" of this instant gratification world we live in. I'm old I guess. If you can get a collection company to accept a pay off, great. But otherwise, pay your bills. We won't take 10 years to pay off what we owe, we just sacrifice and work our asses off for 6 months and boom, done. And we maintain our 800+ credit scores. I think it's okay to have different outlooks here on how someone pays off debt. You're free to share your own, and I should be as well, yes?",

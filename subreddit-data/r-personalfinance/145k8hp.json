    "postText": "Hello I am 36F and need help with creating a financial plan. I got really into personal finance over the pandemic, paid off student loans, credit card debt and started saving for retirement, but have been on autopilot and not paying as much attention to things lately. I\u2019m embarrassed that I racked up some CC debt again. How would you prioritize goals based on the following? \n\nCurrent stats:\n\nSalary: $75k\nDebt: $2700 (credit card)\nEmergency Fund Savings: $6k\nDownpayment fund: $20k (shared with partner)\nRoth IRA: $15k\n403b: $8k\n\nI live with my long term partner and he makes $98k base + avg 10% bonus. We split bills equitably based on income. We are trying to buy a house within the next year and his parents are contributing financially to the downpayment beyond the $20k we currently have saved. \n\nHow should I prioritize? Assuming paying off the credit card should be the #1 priority. \n\nThanks!",

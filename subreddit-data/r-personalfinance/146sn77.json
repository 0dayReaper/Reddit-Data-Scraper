We know how stupid everyone was in all this but it's now affecting money allocated to my wife's inheritance.\n\nI'm writing on behalf of my MIL, who we just learned, was asked by BIL/SIL to put $9,000 on a 0% interest CC to help towards the purchase of land/cabin to open a BNB (bad decision to begin with, we know...they had 0 bookings for Memorial Day weekend, yikes)\n\n$9,000 was the initial amount put on the card in June/July 2022, term for 0% expires July 2023. \n\nOver the past year, MIL has put about $2k of charges on the card. BIL/SIL have only paid off $4,000 of the debt that now sits at $6,000.\n\nHere's my question: does the 25% interest apply to ALL charges made over the last year or only on the $9k initial amount? MIL doesn't know (she's almost 80) and BIL/SIL aren't giving details. \n\nImportance: They're telling her that she needs to sell $2,000+ of stock in a mutually inherited account to pay her part 2k by July to cover her 2k + 25% interest.",

    "postText": "I'm slowly but surely crawling my way out of that lovely college student debt I incurred over four years and gaining financial independence. I've found out how insanely important meal prepping can be. \n\nEvery Sunday, for about 2 hours, I cook and cook and cook. I make sure I make enough for my fianc\u00e9 and I to have lunches for the entire week. That's all it takes, two hours!  And like $40 in groceries. When I was really struggling for money, I would still find myself going out to lunch every single day and spending $10-$15 a meal. That's $50-$75 a week!  Now I cook for two people for less than that. \n\nJust a little advice and personal success here - meal prep your heart out and your wallet will thank you. \n\nEdit: wow!  Did not know how popular this would get. I can't keep up with replying to posts so I'll address two common comments here. \n\n1 - a lot of people keep bringing up the point that the \"cost\" of my time is not worth the meal prep and I beg to differ. These two hours I use are two hours that I would just be playing Overwatch or something like that. And the money I'm saving can work for me in paying off debts and investing, so personally it's my best option.  I realize this doesn't work for everyone. I also can't take the easy way out with $5 boxes at Taco Bell or something similar as my body doesn't tolerate gluten which cuts out most fast food options. \n\n2 - every week I go to Aldi and stock up on brown rice, black beans, corn, ground turkey or tofu, a bag of chicken and some veggies. Most common meal prepped is burrito bowls. Which is 1 pound of ground turkey, 2 cans of beans, 1 can corn, 1 jar of salsa, and brown rice mixed with cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and coriander. Makes 12 cups of food at 1,220 calories total. I divide this up into six 2 cup containers. Then usually make chicken with veggies or gluten free pasta for the remaining two days of meals for us. Utilizing four burners, a stove, and a microwave all at once produces a surprising amount of food very quickly. I store it all in Tupperware for the week and it stays well. Some people recommend prepping and freezing as well. Are there some days where I dread eating the same meal and eat out?  Heck yes, but it's not every day like it used to be. And my wallet and waistline has rewarded me greatly for that. ",

The lack of bitterness is a result of not overextracting the coffee. You can have non-bitter hot-extracted coffee, too, it's just \"harder\" to do (i.e. it's not an entirely brainless process).\n\nImagine you're driving on a runway. There is a green box about three  car lengths wide in which you need to stop the vehicle (yummy), and a red-zone (bitter) if you over shoot it. With cold brew the temperature is low and the extraction slow, therefore you don't get into \"overextracted/bitter\" flavor territory in the time frame you're brewing on (12-24hours), akin to walking down the runway until you're in the zone. Compared with hot brewed coffee (driving 60 miles an hour and trying to slam the brakes in time to stop inside the green box), where this can easily happen in the 5-10min window, your margin of error is much wider. But even that is easy compared to espresso, which typically has an optimal window of extraction on the 5-10 *second* scale.\n\nHope that helps.\nEDIT: three instead of there",

The heat causes an extraction of oils from the grounds, while letting it sit for so long will continue to extract oils from the grounds until there are none left and it starts to develope a bad taste. So it's better to just cold brew which is the same process. You just have to filter in the morning. \n\nPlus you can make a big batch and have it ready every day of the week on top of it being a concentrate. Don't buy into using a toddy, toddy's are for suckers who don't know you can just put coffee in water and filter off the grounds in your autodrip (just pouring it through the funnel on top of your Mr. Coffee)or getting a v60 which I recommend because it is faster. \n\nI hope this was helpful.

If there's something simmering on the stovetop that doesn't need your attention right now, start chopping some other vegetables. While those vegetables are cooking, get started on cleaning up. Learning to time dishes out is a skill you improve. And with all this practice comes natural improvement in your knife skills and other mechanical tasks. ",

We are also picky eaters, and I believe we cook restaurant-grade or better food (I was in the biz). \n\nInstead of doing it once a week - I cook 2-3 times a week instead. Big meals that last for 2-3 days apart (lunch AND dinner). I plan all my meals on Saturday before we shop. We can eat and drink three meals a day for $40 per person per week. I am shocked at how much we save doing this.\n\nETA: for drinks, I make gallons of homemade sweet tea - [here](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/18129531351365607231?q=sweet+tea+splenda+tea+bags&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=747&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.&amp;tch=1&amp;ech=1&amp;psi=0wVjWbDiEofUmAGAzYfwDA.1499661781939.5&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiArebC8_3UAhWDeCYKHTNXCwoQ8wIInQMwAw) (sugar free) and for $2, can have enough for over a month.",

Everybody has a different idea of what they want-- some want weekends off, some want all their working days jammed together so they can have two weeks off in a row every month, some people only want day trips, some want long trips for that sweet per diem. I have been flying the same approximate schedule for about a year, it works out really well for me because the main trip I work puts me in the same city with my SO every week for about 48 hours.  It's nice to get paid for actually being at home!  Sometimes people do 'buddy bid' to work together, my best friend and I bid together about 50% of the time.  You can also bid to avoid certain personnel which is nice. \n\n\nFlight attendants on 'reserve' (on-call new FAs with low seniority) will generally bid for which days they want to be on duty, but won't have a clue as to what they will actually be doing during that time.\n\n\nHope that answers your question!  :)",

Depends on how busy I am at the weekend as to how much I prep on Sunday. \n\nI think it depends on how organised you are with your meals anyway. I plan meals for the week to re-use leftovers and save time/money. For example: cook a huge chicken on one night and have roast chicken one day, use it in stir fry the next and then maybe salad the day after. Doing it this way I think both methods save about the same amount of money. But if you were cooking completely different food each day (requiring different carbs/meat/veg so you don't buy anything in bulk) and having the leftovers for lunch I could see that costing a little more.

It's no coincidence that my coworkers who eat out for lunch every day tend to be overweight.\n\nBut then again, if you are someone who needs a lot of variety at lunch, meal prepping might not be for you, even if you're trying to watch your caloric intake. I personally am a creature of habit and can eat the same thing for breakfast and lunch every day for months on end.

I wouldn't have to answer to anyone, and if I ever don't feel like mealprepping, I just don't. It's hard to find a job that allows you to work whenever you feel like.

There are plenty of home cooks on Kijiji or local businesses that would love to prep your meals for you if you agree with my assessment of takeout foods' healthiness.\n\nI also forgot to add that my work schedule is flexible, so not queuing for food feeds into longer gym breaks or going home earlier, depending how you look at it.",

It doesn't matter how delicious the food is, how pretty I can make it look on the plate, there's nothing fun or appetising about defrosting a container of pre-prepped food. \n\nBut that's because I live to cook and prepare food for myself and my partner. \n\nI recognise that in am privileged to be able to have time to cook every day. \n\nMy grocery budget is $30 a week, I don't prep, but I do plan.\n\nI think planning your meals and not leaving yourself in a position where you're distracted by hunger and your only option for calories is to buy something you didn't plan for is the real secret to sticking to a reasonable food budget. \n\nFor some people meal prep helps them stick to the plan. \n\nFor other people, meal prep just results in a freezer full of food you don't feel like eating, and you continue to cook daily anyway because you enjoy the daily cook.

You have to start slow and accumulate extra food in your freezer. The key is to make a lot of food so that you end up freezing a few extra days worth in the freezer (get some meal prep trays from amazon). Keep doing it and after a few weeks, you can just go back and forth between different dishes.  I don't eat the same thing more than two meals in a row now. I meal prep for a week. I save half of it in the freezer and the other in the fridge. When i don't feel like eating what I just made for that week, I can pull out past dishes.  If you make a new dish every week, you'll end up with an assortment. If I don't eat what I just made that week within a couple of days, I just put it in the freezer.  Sometimes, I cheat and do take-out.  But at least this way, the cheating days because of being bored of my food are few and far between.\n",

This was followed by 20 pounds each of Swedish and Italian meatballs and four meatloaves. This week I'll be making 10 pounds or more of egg noodles. You can't imagine how much time and money it saves you through the year, not to mention that the taste and quality are superior to anything store bought. \n\nMy next step is teaching myself how to can; however, without having my own garden I'm not sure how feasible it is, so I'm not laying out money for canning equipment just yet.

You enhance the most valuable skill a person can have in this world, hands down. You also will naturally eat healthier and train your senses to need less salt, sugar, and fats to taste good. With the savings you have, you also can put some into higher quality ingredients, thus allowing yourself the pleasure of really well made food. If and when you have kids, you can ensure they will have good food, and they will learn a whole lot seeing you cook. And above all, it builds incredible confidence in what you are capable of. It's microcosms of tiny failures that you rapidly learn to fix, and you start to build methods to deal with stress and time management. Cooking is the foundation of civilization for a reason, and it goes way beyond just saving money. ",

Sundays are for staying in the house all day on a nice day if that's what you want to do or for spending time outside if that's what you want to do. Sundays are for some work, but not all the work. Sunday is often our shopping day, (even though we both go separately.) We meal prep Sunday afternoon or evening. We pour glasses of wine or make mixed drinks (we are never without fresh lemons or limes) and chop and slice and fry and sear. Sometimes we listen to music. Sometimes I listen to music alone. Sometimes we meal prep alone and sometimes we do our other Sunday rituals alone, but we keep our rituals. In this way I came to look forward to Sundays and in this way I learned you can teach yourself to enjoy many things you would otherwise find taxing, including meal prep. Cheers!",

They charge for the more for something you could have put together in a few minutes.\n\nWith some googling (or Pinterest if you're into that sort of thing) and little effort you can learn to make basic things from scratch. Example, I wanted turkey sausage in my prepped burritos that I was making today, and couldn't find it. Turns out it's super easy to get the spices from the bulk section, some ground turkey, and whip some up yourself. All in all, I spent about $7 on a pound of home made turkey sausage that covered almost 10 burritos (if I hadn't ran out of eggs). \n\nAnyway, I'm really looking forward to eating healthier food and more money in the bank again.

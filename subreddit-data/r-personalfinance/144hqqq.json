    "postText": "I just started using TreasuryDirect.  I purchased $10k par value and it is now being automatically re-invested.  What's very interesting is TreasuryDirect doesn't rollover the entire amount; the par value of the re-invested TBill is still $10k.  I haven't received the money, but presumably TreasuryDirect will send the excess to my bank account.  \n\nIs there any option to make TreasuryDirect rollover the whole amount so the TBill investment grows within TreasuryDirect over time?",

You'll get the difference between par and purchase price on the issue date, or the day before.\n\n&gt;Is there any option to make TreasuryDirect rollover the whole amount so the TBill investment grows within TreasuryDirect over time?\n\nYou would think you can use $10k to buy 101 bills priced at $99, but you only know this fact after auction has ended. Likewise, Treasury also does not know the outcome of future auctions. Therefore, it does not know how many more bills you can bid on. So it can only let you bid on the same number of bills as you did before.",

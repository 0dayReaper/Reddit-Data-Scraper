    "postText": "Here's my financial picture:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIncome: $100k/year gross salary, with 7% employee matching for a 401(k). Taxes and insurance take out about $27k, and I contribute $13k to my 401(k).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNet worth: $167k, broken out into the following categories:\n\nCash: $18k\n\n401(k): $45k\n\nRoth IRA: $11k\n\nBrokerage account: $93k\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNo debt of any kind. Credit score is about 770.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a government program in my area I am eligible for that would give me a $70k loan towards a down payment on a house. The loan would be deferred for 5 years, and then it would be paid back at 0% interest over a 40-year term.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI live in a HCOL area, I'm in my late twenties (single, no kids), and I'm thinking about buying a house this summer.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy thoughts are that my net income (if you include all the 401(k) money) is $6.6k/month. To stay under 30% of that, my monthly payment should be no more than \\~$2k. I would be willing to sell a good portion of the assets in my brokerage account to add onto the $70k of down payment assistance I can receive, giving my self a max total down payment of \\~$150k. My credit score should give me access to a reasonable interest rate. Tacking property taxes, homeowners insurance, and any HOA fees should put my purchase budget in the $500k range.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDoes that calculation seem reasonable, or is there something I've missed? Is it a good idea to sell off what's in my brokerage account to put towards my down payment? Any advice or rules-of-thumb people use to make this decision would be very much appreciated.",

            "comment": "You are in a pretty decent situation and that government program is a super good deal.\n\nI think $500k is significantly over-budget though. $300k would be a more reasonable ceiling. What is rent like in your area and what can $300k and $500k get you?\n\nTo put it in perspective, me and my partner make about $160-180k jointly and have explored what budgeting for a house would look like. We did expectation setting in advance and will mostly likely be looking at houses in the $250-325k range. We don't have kids or any big payments on debt/cars. But we also want the option of paying it off super fast if we decide we really want to, so $250-325k is lower than what we could *safely* be buying.\n\nOn $100k you have the luxury of flexibility. Don't buy a $500k house and lose that flexibility.",

            "comment": "Whatever you\u2019re telling yourself your net income is to justify stretching your home purchase budget is a bad idea. The number that you need to use is your take-home pay. I think you can lessen your 401(k) contributions to 7% in order to maximize the company match and get the most free money available. That will make your take-home pay $66,000 per year. Your mortgage payments need to stay in the range of about $1400-$1600 per month. That means your max loan should be $200,000 on a 30 year fixed right now. \n\nI think the cash you have in your savings account should stay untouched and should be your emergency fund. I think that\u2019s a bit light for an emergency fund, but since you\u2019re single with no dependents, you can probably make it work. You\u2019ll also need at least $10,000, maybe more, for closing costs.\n\nIf you choose to take on this $70,000 loan program and completely wipe out your brokerage account, your absolute max budget for a house right now is $353,000. This is without knowing anything about that loan program or about any taxes you may owe on selling assets from your brokerage account.\n\nIn a HCOL that likely also comes with high property taxes, high insurance, and just generally costing more than average for day-to-day life expenses, it does not sound like you are quite ready to buy a house yet.",

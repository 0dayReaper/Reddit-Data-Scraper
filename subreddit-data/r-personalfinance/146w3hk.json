I don't think it's wise to do a personal loan with the way interest rates are now. Looking for financing options more specific or designed for this purpose. Thanks!",

            "comment": "&gt; used skid steer\n\nWell, yeah. Commercial equipment isn't going to be able to be financed using normal vehicle loans. Financing heavy equipment (which, yes, I know it's not that heavy, but play along) requires you have proof that the equipment can be supported by your business income.\n\nSo, business loan or personal loan it is.",

Their website says \"whether commercial or application\" and I guess I am not entirely sure what their definition of \"application\" is, but given the context it would seem to be for personal use.",

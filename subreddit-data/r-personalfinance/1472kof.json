    "postText": "Hey Friends!\n\nIn the past, I used to shy away from learning about personal finance, which led me to anxiously save without a proper plan. However, I'm now committed to creating a real financial plan for myself. While I have read the wikis and mega-threads, I still have a few questions that I would love your help with.\n\nMy situation:\n\nI am 28 and have roughly $35K (not including my $6K emergency fund) just sitting in a standard Chase savings account, and about $20K in my roth 401(k). My goals are to retire in comfort in my 60's, and to buy a house sometime within the next 10 - 15 years.  I do not plan on having children and already have a car I loved paid off, so I don't have any real finical goals besides the two I mentioned, and wanting to travel to cool places and eat over priced food guilt free every now and then. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThings I am still confused about:\n\n1) Roth 401(k) vs IRA \n\nUnfortunately, my employer doesn't offer any matching contributions to our retirement accounts. The wiki emphasizes utilizing employer accounts for matching purposes and directing additional savings into an IRA. Currently, I have a Roth 401(k) through my employer. From what I understand, Roth 401(k)s and IRAs operate quite similarly. Am I mistaken? Are there enough of an advantages in an IRA where I should set up an account?  Would it be beneficial to switch my Roth 401(k) to a traditional account and then open an IRA?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Saving for 10-15 year goals\n\nRegarding my goals of building wealth over the next 10-15 years, my plan is to open a simple account with a company like Fidelity and invest in an index fund or a three-fund portfolio. I'm considering using a robo-advisor or similar tools for guidance. Are there any specific companies or accounts that are better suited for these types of goals, or are most of the big names fairly similar? Are there any other financial tools or strategies I should be considering for building wealth over this timeframe?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) What to prioritize\n\nI know my 401(k) is not currently at the recommended balance, and since I am approaching 30 it ideally should be closer to $80K. I have already increased how much I contribute on each paycheck, but don't know if I should put all the cash I currently have into the 401(k) to have a big balance sooner that can grow for longer, or what amount I can/should set aside for my 10-15 year goals\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI appreciate y'all so much! Thank in advance for all your guidance! \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "Roth 401K and Roth IRA are two separate retirement accounts. The Roth 401K annual contribution limit for 2023 is $22500. The Roth IRA limit is $6500. Max out the Roth IRA first then gradually max out your Roth 401K if you're comfortable with your monthly budget.\n\nThere are changes coming to the Roth 401K in 2024 due to the Secure Act 2.0. Among the changes, depending on your employer, you'll have the option to invest your company's matching contribution into the Roth 401K instead of only in the traditional 401K. There will be no RMDs for Roth 401K as well.",

            "comment": "&gt;Roth 401(k) vs IRA\n\nSince there are no matching contributions in the 401(k), standard advice is to prioritize maxing out a Roth IRA first, and then go back to your 401(k) and increase contributions to that. The main reason for this is that you can open a Roth IRA at a firm like Fidelity/Vangaurd/Schwab that has no fees and great, low-cost investment options. 401(k) plans will almost always have at least a small annual maintenance fee and can sometimes limit you to sub-optimal, high-cost mutual funds. \n\n&gt;2) Saving for 10-15 year goals\n\nThe firms recommended on this sub are all fine for doing everything you say. I personally don't think you need to do a roboadvisor because setting up a simple, basic portfolio of index funds is very easy to do. But that doesn't mean it's a bad option. Fidelity Go is a great roboadvisor product that has some of the lowest fees in the industry. \n\nDon't forget to follow the Prime Directive to help you make sure that you're allocating every one of your dollars in the best fashion. \n\n&gt;3) What to prioritize\n\nFollow the Prime Directive. And don't worry about putting your cash savings into the 401(k). Because you can't. 401(k) contributions can only come from payroll deductions.",

I think there are better options for me to explore than just dumping everything I have into the 401k",

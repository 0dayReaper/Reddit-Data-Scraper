    "postText": "For reference, I just graduated college  and landed a job working at a school as a teacher making 50k a year. I am also working part time in my building as a front desk manager where I basically push a button to open the main door for tenants. I have a computer in front of me and usually I do my homework at that job since I work the late night shifts.\n\nI plan on keeping this job when I start my teaching job in August and do my lesson plans at this job for the next day. It is 18 an hour and part time at roughly 25 hours a week generates around 675$ every 2 weeks. I wanted to do some early calculations so I can look at how much to allocate towards savings, etc. \n\nA 50k salary as a person living in New York City with no dependents, single, and assuming I take the standard deduction. \n\nI have looked at other websites to try and calculate and it has all given me different answers. Obviously there's no way to know how much exactly but a rough estimate on how much I would get paid bi-weekly if others have any ideas, I would appreciate! Thanks!",

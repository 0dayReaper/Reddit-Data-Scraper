Just remember that next time you talk yourself out of asking for a raise.\n\nEdit: Ok, so I've only been responding to push notifications and didn't realize this is the top post on Personal Finance. Wowsers.\n\nAlso all of you have provided so many good comments and insights I failed to point out. What a sub you have here.\n\nEdit: My phone is so old that trying to turn off the push notifications is causing it to freeze. Front page life is hard. I'm still in disbelief this made the front page. More importantly the collective participation has been amazing. From useful to funny, you guys killed it. Thanks to employers who weren't afraid to offer their own food for thought. It made for a more valuable thread.",

If an employee with 5-7 years on the job leaves, they\u2019ll replace him/her  with a new hire with 2 years experience at 2/3rds the salary. Other employees will suck up some of the job duties, or have a chance to progress. \n\nKnow your market and your employer\u2019s culture. \n\nEdit: Thanks for the gold! ",

I took over this crew a year ago. \n\nMy new guys are hungry and strive to improve and impress. 2 of my 3 tenured guys won't accept coaching without extreme pushback because they're \"experienced and know what they're doing\". \n\nTenure doesn't automatically equate to profitable and worthwhile. \n\nEDIT: Thanks for the first gold I've ever received!\n\nI didn't expect this to blow up.\n\nI agree with a lot of what I'm seeing in responses! I'm not always right and won't be. I have done what my technicians all do for 8 years before moving to the department above them and now I've moved back to their department as management. I have knowledge of the position but I'm still learning methods of coaching and teaching different personalities and generations. \n\nIn my team, out of the 2 tenured guys that are struggling, one is staying the same and one is on an upward trend as he's becoming more comfortable and willing to ask for advice from me and discuss how to improve his numbers. The other has plainly said \"Someday when you have kids you'll worry about more than work. I'm just here for the pay, I know I'm doing a good enough job. I think your numbers are wrong.\". Obviously there's the issue. \n\nI did not mean this response to say all tenure is bad. My best tech earned technician of the year awards last year and is consistently my star I lean on. We max his raises consistently and he earns it. No intention of \"pushing him out\" only to promotion if anything. \n\nThank you all for the responses! I understand the RIP Inbox now. ",

But as far as trades go? I'd say let the vets do their work and stay out of their way.\n\nI saw a 72 year old man monkey around with no harness on a Sunday when there were no mill safety guys to slow him down and he welded out casing to an entire side of a 5 bay tall boiler in about 14 hours when we were trying to get out of there. We had like 4 guys on the other 3 walls welding out. (Per wall) It was weird because he was so old and slow but once he got going, stopping him just pissed him off and fucked up his process.\n\nNot saying to not wear a harness or anything but those old guys just know how to not fall.

We're not developers, we were Operations.  Agile did have a few lessons that had value to us, many were neutral, and some others made no fucking sense and over time, I re-implemented efficient process for those items..\n\nHowever, to align properly with the rest of the teams, we needed to conform.  It is my belief that it was probably helpful for the company overall to adopt this strategy mostly because it actually *was* a strategy, as opposed to \"play it by ear\".\n\nOne person on my team was very, very good as doing things off in his own corner.  He didn't want to attend stand-ups and he didn't want to have anything to do with the Kanban board.  He just wanted to \"work\" like he always had.  He was no slouch and he wasn't stupid and his work was good, if not exactly innovative.\n\nBut unlike many, he didn't just grumble and go along with it, he was openly insubordinate and put up obstacles.  So he got fired.  And it was a fucking stupid reason to get fired that was pure stubbornness.\n\nWas he good at his job?  He certainly had his system down.  Was he able to adapt?  In this extreme case, he was inflexible, and that cost him.\n\nI make a concerted effort to consider people who are older in hiring, because I'm not exactly getting younger myself, and what goes around comes around.  But you absolutely cannot sit on your ass, cross your arms, and expect that your personal efficiency and your long experience is all that matters.  That is a good way to become a dinosaur long before your time.  Always be learning new things.",

In those fields, they frequently work hungry and enthusiastic young folk really hard, provide increasingly diminishing returns and little upward mobility within the company, and then after a few years slash the older employees for cheaper new blood because the old blood now lacks the \"attitude\" they are looking for. \n\nIf it is indeed a culture thing, then it would still be cheaper to solve the problem with improved management than to continually rehire new people after a few years.",

If I wanted to ask for a raise, personally for me it wasn't in the cards since the CEO clearly gave low-ball salaries to begin with in comparison to the area, argued with employees constantly about policies, and gave massive amounts of work  for the level of actual pay. Asking for a salary raise at my former employer would have surely made me tackle more responsibilities for a marginal pay raise. It was worth it for me to switch jobs given the subpar culture and stressful job duties demanded by management. If you think you're at a place with no upward mobility or a place that doesn't give pay raises each year, definitely look around for a new job someplace else. Definitely know your market and your employer\u2019s culture!",

I had been contracting for a while, and was shocked to rejoin the workforce and find out that a 3% raise was considered good...  This is part of the reason that people switch jobs every 2-3 years, it's the only way to get a meaningful raise, especially if you ahve the skills/experience.",

Silicon Valley is notorious for high turn over rates in the long term. Most companies lose 20% of their workforce in a year. Within five year you have no senior staff who has been there for more than 2-3 years. This means your company can't have a long term goal because you're constantly trying to keep staff and the lights on. So cost cutting employees salaries is an easy way to do this. A lot of corporate executives know this problem and a lot of them inherited this mess from their predecessors. The 2020s will be a bloodbath for corporations professional staff. A lot of boomers are expected to retire by 2021. This will leave a massive shortage in a lot of jobs. Millennial college graduates won't be able to replace them. Bill Gates talks a lot about the impending college graduate shortage. ",

If you can justify being paid up from what you are, you're more likely to land yourself in an important position and be compensated appropriately. Nobody stays important in a company forever, and often more specialized individuals will be brought in to be that important person; so you simply need to be the specialized individual elsewhere.\n\nEdit: To an extent, this also represents a partially optimal way for companies to function. It doesn't make sense to pay somebody specialized rates when they're not being used for a specialized activity, and training new staff likely makes more financial sense than paying an unnecessary premium. For the employees, shopping around just means finding a job that most ideally fits your skill set--and accordingly brings the highest possible pay.",

They knew how valuable she was\u2014she was ten times more productive and five times better than the next best person they had\u2014but something about either the management or the payroll/finance/HR just refused to compensate her appropriately.\n\nON THE OTHER HAND, she immediately got a job at twice the salary, twice the bonus, much more recognition, and a company culture she likes infinitely better.\n\nYour mileage may vary. Being insistent is kind of a crap shoot, so hope for the best, but do be prepared for the worst.",

Everyone would be better off if employers just paid existing employees market rate for their position, but since no single person \"owns\" call the costs associated with turnover, it incentivize employers to make sub-optimal decisions regarding compensation. \n \nFor many/most skilled positions, it can take months for a new hire to get up to full productivity, so the hidden costs for employers when you have turnover are actually probably understated. If I make 100K and market is 115K, you're better off just paying me market because if I leave then not only do you have to pay my replacement market rate (or close to it), but you also have to pay someone for 6 months of labor when their productivity is only, say 50%, of the tenured employee that left. So your costs would be an extra 15K/yr to keep me, or 10-15K/yr + ~30-40K in turnover costs (HR/recruitment costs, lost productivity). ",

I was hired at ~60% premium over her salary, which I only came to learn years later. Over six years, her responsibilities and authority grew, until the point where a staff of 50 experienced individuals were accountable to her. Her pay? Marginal (~2%) increases over the years. Management insisted she was paid fairly. Spoilers - with no disrespect to the food industry, there are people flipping burgers who make more than she did.\n\nShe left six or so years into it, for a job that paid her seven times as much, doing one third as much.\n\nMyself? Independently, I was, of course, pushing for my own pay increases and getting some here and there, but after the first one, nothing to really write home about - but nothing to be super unhappy with. Until, about five years in, I found out what my peers in my subgroup were making. I made a simple projection based on years experience and education that fit the other 4, and asked for 87% of what would fit me on that curve - which, mind, would still have been the lowest by a good amount - in the group. I was told by a VP (!!!) I wasn't worth that amount - unfortunately, I'd gotten to our meeting earlier than he expected and overheard him leaving a desperate VOICemail to his boss, an SVP, asking how much he was authorized to offer me to stay.\n\nIt's all over the place, there are so many motivations and factors, it can be unknowable from the other side. I'm a supervisor now, and we have one guy who is in a similar position - he's underpaid (slightly), but we can't utilize the skills he's worth, and while we'd like to retain him, if he needs more money and threatens to walk, we're going to sadly let him go. Our unit just does not have the budget. We would do better taking the productivity hit and regaining some profitability than turning unprofitable.\n\nEDIT: I foolishly typed \"email\" when I meant \"voicemail,\" so the below responses make more sense. I've corrected above, but left the add in ALL CAPS to call out my MISTAKE",

I left for another company, instantly doubled my pay while also moving to an area with a 75% reduction in cost of living. On top of the giant raise I also ended up with severance to leave and a sign-on bonus at the new company. \n\nAlways keep that LinkedIn page up to date and open for opportunities, I get heaps of recruiters messaging me on there. Can't hurt to get an actual offer and compare it to where you're at. Your market rate isn't what you're currently paid but what somebody is willing to pay. You won't know that unless you're open to offers. \n\nGranted I work in the tech bubble so ymmv elsewhere. If you work in tech or want to, be in silicon valley for your early career. Yes it sucks and it eats your soul but you can bounce around to different companies better than anywhere else. Once you get your market rate up then branch out and live where you want, your Bay Area polished resume will demand the top positions in any given area or allow you to work remotely. You want to end up making Bay Area money somewhere it is cheap to live. ",

I have found that being really direct and honest helps tremendously.\n\nFor example, give your boss a heads-up by saying \"Hey I'd like a chance to discuss my salary soon - maybe sometime next week/month?\" which gives them time to prepare a bit. Maybe you've been agonizing over your \"get a raise\" game plan for months, but your boss may be oblivious. Dropping a bomb on them like another job offer might seem like it's coming out of the blue.\n\nWhen it is time to talk, don't jump straight to trying to get a raise. Simply ask about their expectations to qualify for a raise. I'm talking of course about a significant raise and/or promotion, not a standard yearly review kind of thing. Try to nail down specifics - things you can point to in the near future once they've been accomplished.\n\nA big part of the problem is that people want their raise ASAP, but the best time to plan for a raise is always 6 months ago. Every significant pay bump I've received happened around 3-9 months AFTER I started gunning for it. The best time to talk about a raise is a few months into your new job. That way you can clearly communicate that you are not asking for a raise - you are planning for one.\n\nGetting a raise isn't honestly about market rate research, competing offers, and financial arithmetic. It is about communication, expectations, planning, performing, and keeping a good attitude.",

He swiftly created so much value for the company in a time when they needed it that his negotiation power is unmatched. He then went out and secured financial freedom to enhance his negotiating power. The risk of his power play is that he's in a sport in which fans move on very quickly, and if he keeps putting off fighting to get a more beneficial contract, his leverage and power will dwindle.

I worked at a company for a little under 8 years, and they paid much lower than everyone else in their field at virtually every position. But for several years it was ok because the company culture was great, they were constantly letting people know they were appreciated with dinners and tickets to events and bonuses etc.\n\nThen they were bought out and raises were capped at 3%, all forms of making employees feel appreciated stopped, and a bunch of \"events\" were held that plainly showed there was no money or thought put into them. Then the CEO (who used company email as his own personal bullhorn) started sending emails telling people that if they didn't like where the company was headed that they were free to leave, and that's exactly what everyone did. Every person I know that left makes at least 10k more per year somewhere else and is much happier. Now that company can't retain anyone and can't attract anyone worth a damn because they make low ball offers to every qualified candidate, then they complain because they can't figure out why nobody wants to work there.\n\nThe common thread in all this is that the company started pinching pennies. Maybe they didn't spend a ton in salaries, but they invested in their people in other ways. Once that stopped, there was no reason for anyone to work there, and there still isn't. When I left they tried to persuade me to stay by telling me I needed to be a team player because \"we're family\". No we're not, I work for money, and you don't pay nearly enough of it, nor do you spend any of it to make me feel like I'm valued. So peace out.\n\nThe point is, it's always about money, and you can never make enough. Meanwhile people who make 2 or 3 or 4 or 5x your salary will always stonewall you. \"There's plenty for us but none for you\"",

Employees talk and learn why someone was replaced/fired, and if it comes down to someone not being paid fairly it tends to send up red flags to a lot of people (generally the more talented ones) that looking for a new job wouldn't be a bad idea.\n\nLosing (1) quality employee over money can easily lead to a situation where you lose an entire team and set the company's goals back by a year or more depending on what type of business it is.",

I have never been a union member so I am always only looking at myself compared to the industry. In my previous position I was the highest paid person with my title and had less experience than most of the other people... but I was worth it. \n\nI told them I would commit to staying two more years with the company for a title bump and no raise, which they denied. \n\nI informed them I would be quitting and within a few weeks I was fired for bullshit. Senior management (C-level executives) didn't think I was worth it. \n\nWithin a month I was hired in at a much larger company, got about a 40% raise, PLUS the title bump I wanted. It took my former company (1) year to find someone to fill my position and they are still trying to figure out what all my programs did. All in their decision probably set back their goals by (2) years. I've since found out that a number of other people also left (I told all of them exactly why I was let go,) and that the C-level executive who didn't think I was worth it is no longer very well respected (for a variety of other reasons.)\n\nLong story short it was very costly to replace me and in my example I wasn't even asking for a raise. In retrospect I probably could have gotten a raise but not the title jump. Go figure.",

It was uncomfortable for sure, but the planned raises this year would have otherwise been 2%, and I feel like my boss respected me for being direct about it. \n\nYMMV, but at least in my case, it was worth raising the issue w/ my employer before looking to jump ship.",

Her response was \"Well, maybe I can get you some of the trade gift cards from HR\" (I worked at a company that got tons of free trade from businesses they contracted with).  She didn't know I was just waiting to hear back from a large ad agency in my city on whether I got the job. \n\nLater that very same week I got the job offer and accepted. I went to put in two weeks' notice to my boss. She offered to go to corporate and counteroffer. I openly told her \"I know corporate won't match the 33% bump I'm getting by going to this ad agency. Also, last week I was only worth gift certificates at best to you.\" She was silent after that. \n\nThe moral? Always know what you're worth in dollars and cents. If I was ever in this situation again, I'd negotiate before I accepted another job just to see how much they truly value my work and contributions to the company. Somehow, there's always money in the budget when you're about ready to walk-- and them finding that money is about their convenience in not training someone new, not about what they think you're worth.

Employer wouldn't move. They offered this generous, but insane, bonus schedule in lieu of a salary increase. The lowest tiers we achievable, but the highest tiers were not (at least not for a few years), but they looked good on paper. \n\nI found another job within a month. When I turned in my notice, they started in with additional offers, and brought me in to multiple closed door meetings to discuss why I should stay.  My decision was made and I walked. They had to  search for and train a new employee. They had to explain to the customer, who liked how I had run the project, that I would no longer be working on their product. It cost them quite a bit. \n\nAt the new job, I was offered a promotion to senior level within a year. Didn't even ask for it. This raise was bigger than any of the bonus options offered by the previous company. \n\nNeedless to say, I agree with this tip. I would add that if you don't get what you deserve, have a plan of escalation. Don't lie to get a raise, but if you do get an offer from another employer, know whether or not you will accept before you tell your boss, and stick with it. ",

You will feel regret at leaving and you will miss your colleagues but dig in and follow through - you will be far better off.\n\nThis is *especially* true when the counter-offer is accompanied by promises of career progression. Never stay on a promise, no matter how good it sounds. Refer previous paragraph for why any promises of advancement are utterly empty in this scenario (would you promote someone whose loyalty is in question?).\n\nCompare that to moving on to the new job, where you have a fresh start, and will get what is being offered right now.\n\nAlso, on principle you might consider if you want to work somewhere where threatening to leave is required to have your value to the business recognised.",

It is usually the attitude of the owners \"don't get that shit started\" that prevents the raises. I prefer to give everyone three goals, you meet the goals you get the raise. People that don't meet the goals just don't want to and are on the first to cull list. You either improve and grow or you need to go. It's a much more effective expenditure than laying out capital for just another piece of machinery. ",

Even this move recommended by the person leaving. \n\nI was offered a lowball offer of 8k/year on my salary. 4K upfront and 4K after 6 months. I told one of the owners that it wasn\u2019t enough, politely, then sent an email to them both very carefully yet clearly structured and worded explaining why I thought the position required more compensation. \n\nI was denied. They explained why. I thanked them for the consideration and then focused on my education while I worked there. \n\nThey ended up hiring 4 people to do that job at $10/hr. Two are left now. Which makes me chuckle because with insurance costs, training time, and salaries they still would\u2019ve saved money if they had agreed to give me what I asked for (or even negotiated it down a little with incentives or something). \n\nlol and behold one day one owner comes in, asks what I am making per year, then proceeds to tell me they are giving me a 35% pay increase (14k/yr) and added two new roles to my job description. \n\nI\u2019ve busted my tail on both on top of managing the DC I was already doing (and the partial job I was doing that originally I wanted to absorb into my position, granted I rarely do it anymore. I\u2019m more of an emergency back up for the two people left if they need help). \n\nNeedless to say. This year I put my word it with my direct superiors in two different departments (it\u2019s a complicated structure now with what I do lol) to get me a recommendation for another bump in pay as well as recommending a crew member who really stepped up and I feel earned a pay increase even though he\u2019s only been here for 6 months (reviews are once per year this month). \n\nWe\u2019ll see what happens. But I have my old resume at home and was looking it over and if I don\u2019t get a respectable bump in pay, I will be looking elsewhere for my raise. February will be 11 years with this company (worked my up from the bottom as a temporary) and I really do like and respect the owners and their company (been to the gym with one a few times), but at some point I need to put that aside and work for myself and my family and with the way the rent/housing and general cost of living is going in this market, I need fair compensation in order to live comfortably and not be living paycheck to paycheck because I can barely afford rent. \n\nWhat I make now was a comfortable living salary a decade ago before I got this gig. It\u2019s not anymore. ",

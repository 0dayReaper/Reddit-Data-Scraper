After filing taxes the IRS came back and said I owed a LOT (talking almost 6 figures) on something that is now essentially worthless with no sign of it ever recovering.\n\n\nWhile I'm not looking for anyone to give legal advice, the estimate from a lawyer to look into it is about the same as the value of the stock now, but without any guarantee that it would even solve anything.\n\n\nGiven that, I was wondering if anyone here has run into this same issue and knows if something like this is actually solvable or if I'm just doomed to have to sell an arm and a leg for something I don't even have.",

To be more precise about how capital losses work:\n\n* Each year, you net capital losses (including carryforward, see below) vs capital gains\n  * Long-term losses are first netted against long-term gains. (This means that losses reduce, dollar for dollar, any gains of that type. So if you have $10,000 in gains and $5,000 of losses, that is the same as if you had $5,000 of gains. If you have $25,000 in losses, then you would have a $15,000 net loss coming out of this step.)\n  * Short-term losses are first netted against short-term gains\n  * If you have a net long-term loss and/or a net short-term loss coming out of the previous steps, that loss is netted against gains in the other category; or if a loss, then added to that loss. (Example: if you have $10,000 in long-term gains and $5,000 in short-term losses, the $5K in short-term losses offset $5K of the long-term losses.)\n  * In this step, there is no limit to how much in losses can be \"used.\" If you have a million dollar gain and a $800,000 loss, that's a $200,000 gain.\n* If you have an overall net loss for the year, up to $3,000 of it offsets ordinary income.\n* If you *still* have more losses, they carry forward to the following year and re-enter the process up above. (These losses still retain their short-term or long-term-ness for the first steps above.)\n\nThat said: this isn't super relevant for OP. OP's problem here, apparently, is that the amount that owed in tax is *not based on capital gains*: RSU vesting is compensation, and ordinary income; so it is subject to the $3K/year limit. Just not for the reason you named.",

The year doesn't matter (except to determine whether it was a short-term or long-term capital loss).\n\nUnfortunately, as far as the tax code (and therefore the IRS) is concerned, you received stock at vesting that was worth some amount at that time, just as if you had bought it in the stock market, but you got it for free, so that's taxable income to you.  The fact that it later lost value doesn't \"cancel it out\", you just had a capital loss, same as if any other stock that you bought had gone down in value after you bought it.",

Can you look at your 2022 tax return and examine what information is on it?\n\nThere are several simple errors you may have made while filing your return which may address a large part of this, or you may still owe lots of tax.\n\nI have seen partial replies in the comments, but in the **greatest possible detail**, how much do you know and understand about what types of stock-based compensation you received, had vest, and sold in 2022?  If you want to use notional amounts instead of the actual amounts for anonymity, that's fine.\n\nDo you have access to any of these documents?\n\n* Forms 1099-B from a broker or agent showing the proceeds from selling stock.\n* Forms W-2 from your employer with a memo line about stock compensation, or an amount in Box 12, code V\n* Forms 3921 from 2022 or any prior year\n* Any other financial statement about vesting, sale, or tax payments in 2022\n\nIf you don't feel able to go into this much detail, I would recommend starting with an Enrolled Agent or CPA, not a lawyer.",

They don\u2019t give freebee cards because \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u201d. Call them and set up a payment plan. After you call a lawyer call a cpa because you\u2019re going to need one of those too. \n\nOn another note - I was a little unhappy today - I bought in COIN at 300$ per share and sold at 50, losing almost 900 dollars. You made my day a little better. You can always post your losses to WSB for upvotes.",

    "postText": "Hi all, Im shopping around for a new insurance company for my 1997 honda accord. The car is probably only worth less than $3000. I dont have the money to replace the car at the moment in case any major damage/an accident happened to total it, as Im working on increasing my emergency fund. I\u2019m getting 100/300/100, but im debating whether I need the extea $100 for comprehensive and $100 for collision? Im pretty new to understanding all this. Thanks!",

            "comment": "If you lose the car, I assume you will need to replace it, yes?  So, your options are A) pay someone else for insurance, or B) self insure.  \n  \nSelf insure means that you keep your extra $100/$100, but have to pay out of pocket if you lose the car through your own fault (or through a no-fault event).  Depending on how long you can save that money, this could come out more or less cheap than just paying the insurance company.  You must weigh the risk and make the decision.  \n  \nFor the record, I own a '97 vehicle worth about $3000, and I dropped everything except liability 15 years ago.",

I never had an at fault accident or a ticket, but i have been 18 and drove a convertible, before you get too excited it was a 86 K-car. Insurance sucks if you are male and under 25, especially if you live in a state with notoriously high insurance.  I pay less for 3 cars for 2 years now than i used to pay for one car for 6 months.",

Likely after two or three years, you have spent $3,000 that you could have saved. The insurance company will not pay out more than 74% of the car's value to repair it. Anything more than that and the car will be totaled. These days a bumper, tail light, and paint may very well be close to totaling out a car worth less than $3,000...",

    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\n21F looking to start investing. I identify more with the \u201cpassive investor\u201d mentality, so I thought about using the dollar-cost averaging strategy and buying Vanguard\u2019s LifeStrategy ETFs. \n\nI saw it is recommended to start with a higher stock allocation while the time horizon before you intend to cash out is further away, due to there being more time to recover from any possible losses due to the higher risk you\u2019re taking. \n\nIt is then recommended to reduce your allocation of stocks as the time horizon before cashing out shortens in order to make the portfolio more stable. I\u2019m not sure I quite understand how this will actually look like in terms of actions: am I recommended to sell my, say, LifeStrategy80% and start buying 40%? Or one day stop buying 80% and start buying 40%? I am a bit confused about this.\n\nThanks very much for any responses. You\u2019re also welcome to give your opinions about my investment strategy. For more context, I\u2019m not sure I have a goal for cashing out yet, just looking to protect my money against inflation and kickstart the compounding effect early.\n\nEdit: I\u2019m not from the US so I don\u2019t know of any target retirement funds here, although it would have been a great option as some of you suggested.",

            "comment": "Ideally you'd never sell until retirement because taxes. And you're correct that at some point you'd stop buying 100% stocks, go down to 80 them 60, 40 etc.\n\nHowever when you're 60 you might still live 30 years so you should still be invested in the stock market to grow your wealth while retired.\n\nThere's also the Vanguard Target Date Funds to automate this.\n\nYou're only 21 so I'd start with 100% Stocks with the All World probably. When should you switch to buying the 80%? I dont really know too maybe at 40",

Fortunately, Vanguard also offers those.",

    "postText": "::Throwaway account::\n\nI am seeking financial advice on one of the few large purchases in life, a primary residence. Housing market sucks but we are outgrowing our small housing currently. We are freshly under contract on  a 2.1 million dollar house in option period now and I wanted to poll the community on how financially responsible or irresponsible it is. Background: My career and job is very stable and I earn between 700k-800k annually depending on our bonuses. I live in a higher property tax state but no income tax. I plan to put 20% down and expect the monthly costs to amount to 13.5k a month. Is this an irresponsible decision or value of house to be purchasing? Or is it expensive but still within reason given our income? The covid housing market with now higher interest rates has my perspective a little lacking right now. Thanks in advance.",

How much other debt do you have?\n\nThe best exercise you can do is sit down, list out your monthly income versus your monthly expenses.  Include all expenses, even those you might only pay once or twice a year such as auto registration/insurance, umbrella policy, etc.  Just take the semi-annual or annual payment amount and make it a monthly amount by dividing by 6 or 12.  I'd hope you'd have several thousand left after covering all your expenses.  I'd hope you are putting a nice amount away every month in as many saving/investment vehicles as possible.  If you can easily cover all the expenses, all the savings/investments and have money left, you can afford the house.",

Currently, as we\u2019ve been saving for a house, we have been maxing 2 401ks (45kish a year) 2 iras (13k) and have an automatic transfer of 25k a month from checking to high yield savings for house savings. I think all my numbers point to yes this is a reasonable housing cost all things considered, I am just having cold feet and struggling with the idea of spending such a high percentage of our income on housing. For perspective our current housing expense is typically 4% of my monthly gross and that feels so so nice. But we don\u2019t have room for another kid and the schools aren\u2019t where we want to be for a few years down the road.",

The limitation is more on the hours in the day and not the work available. My field is more resilient to recession than most and there are a lot of opportunities locally with similar compensation for the job title. Knowing the field I honestly am more concerned with the risk of disability over losing my job, but that concern is low and I do have disability insurance. We are not completely a single income household but my wife\u2019s income decreased significantly after having our child as she is valuing her time with him over work at his young age.",

I would say my disability coverage is very good and my life insurance is ok. I do believe if I died my wife could pay off the mortgage with the pay out, but likely she would sell and move. Generally, I\u2019m on the more conservative side with my money, just live in a high COL location, need to stay central for work, and want to live near good public schools instead of paying for private schools.",

The market does feel inflated, but I also don\u2019t know what to believe about the future of the market either. Some advice will be, if you need to move and you can afford the house, then buy it. Some advice is that the market is near the top and 08 is about to happen again, and some people say supply will stay low bc of owners not selling their low rates and float the market along at current prices. I don\u2019t know what to believe but also don\u2019t think any one can say for sure, that\u2019s what speculation is for. Where does that leave me? Mostly just unsure and in search of a house in a good school district in my city.",

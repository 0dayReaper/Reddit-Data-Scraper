    "postText": "Title. I went out of town for 3 months, and missed the 3 notifications via mail that my insurance was going to be cancelled via non payment. They stuck me with another company, that was $1800 more per year, then I found out 3 months after (5 months after insurance was cancelled). No my escrow is $150 more, I'm back on Traveler's, but I'm stuck with the bill. Travelers says the mortgage company didn't want to pay, Mortgage company says Traveler's didn't send them proper identification(?) Original mortgage got bought and transferred to new company that fumbled my insurance about 8 months prior.\n\nI understand me being out of town really screwed this up, but I also shouldn't be responsible for my mortgage company/insurance company not communicating properly. Am I still liable for this? Any recourse?",

If you\u2019re getting notices of nonpayment, then so does your mortgage company if the premiums are paid through escrow. It should say that right in your insurance policy paperwork.",

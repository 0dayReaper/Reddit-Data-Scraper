My suggestion will be to start at the beginning of the flowchart, save maybe $1000 for a small emergency fund, and then focus on paying off your high interest credit card debt.",

Those high rates will drag you down.\n\nMost of this subredditnwould disagree, but dump your emergency fund into the credit card debt too, especiallybifnits over 10% or so.  If you have an emergency before you can build it back up, then you can dip back into that.  No sense in spending $300 in interest every year so you can have $1000 in your checking account for example... you can go back to paying the interest when an emergency happens and you genuinely need it.",

    "postText": "I keep reading anecdotes around the internet (Credit Karma, etc) about how people immediately pay off the charges on their credit card after using them. I heard actor Ben Stein say as much on NPR years ago. I got a good laugh hearing him talk about being disliked by credit card companies for paying down his balances right away, denying them any income from interest. \n\nGoing by context, I assume they are talking about the same day. It sounds like a great idea, except is it actually a real thing? \n\nI am probably mistaken, but I could swear that my bank issued credit card (not debit card) used to clear pending transactions within 24 hours. I'd pay the balance down as quickly as possible. At some point in the past few months, credit card transactions started taking anywhere from 3-5 days before clearing. That doesn't work in my favor if I'm trying to build up my credit by using my card, even sparingly, and paying down the balance ASAP. \n\nI'm just curious if the whole paying off the credit card balance immediately is a thing of the past? Or was it always an urban myth? And if not, is it normal for different credit cards to take differing periods of time to clear pending transactions?",

Even though I set it up to pay the *full balance* autopay would only make the minimum payment. This in spite of the fact that my credit card is issued through my bank. Hence my question about paying off my balance ASAP. \n\nNot to mention I am learning that now credit agencies care more about how much available credit I actually use instead of the fact I always have my card paid in full by the due date monthly. With my single credit card having a very low limit, if I so much as get a tank of gas, I've effectively overused what is considered reasonable by the credit bureaus which makes me jumpy to pay the balance very quickly.",

You only need to pay the minimum payment by the deadline to be on time and in good standing. But that\u2019s bad for you in terms of the interest you\u2019ll pay. Paying in full (or at least the full statement balance) is what you need to do to avoid interest, but you only need to do that once per month.\n\nBut utilization is important for your credit score. You want to keep your utilization below 30% at least. Since you have a low limit and you can easily go over 30% utilization, in your circumstance it would make sense to pay things off more frequently. As you build your credit and/or increase your income, the credit card company will increase your limit, so that will no longer be necessary. But yes, my transactions typically take several days to post so it\u2019s not possible to pay for each item individually immediately after charging. Maybe make a habit of paying it once per week or on some other regular schedule for now. Your utilization doesn\u2019t need to be under 30% every single day. Just on whichever day they check. Or, don\u2019t charge everything to your card, but pay with debit and just pay one or two monthly bills with your credit card to build credit.",

My reasons for multiple payments have changed over time. Early on, weekly payments helped me learn to control my spending. I\u2019d save all my receipts, then review what I\u2019d spent weekly when I made payment. It was amazing how fast my weekly charges added up, often for stuff that I wished I hadn\u2019t bought just a few days later. Later, I found it easier to make payments twice a month, so I wouldn\u2019t have a big bill due when the mortgage was due. Today, if I make a really big purchase, I\u2019ll make an extra payment just because I dislike having a huge bill at end of month.\n\nNotice that all my extra payments are for emotional reasons, not mathematical ones? I don\u2019t save money when I make multiple payments. I actually lose a few pennies of interest on my checking account. But sometimes those extra payments help me manage emotions around money and debt, so I do it even though it isn\u2019t necessary.",

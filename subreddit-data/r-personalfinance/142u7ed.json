About to lose my home and have no food but a couple ramen packets.\n\nI need advice here on what to do, it's so embarrassing to not be able to provide for yourself.\n\nI got denied by SNAP the first time I applied I'm going in tomorrow to try again.\n\nBut does anyone have any advice or resources.  Everything's crumbling around me at this point.\n\n(This is not me looking for handouts I need a plan or resources)",

If being homeless is imminent in the near future, tell them you are already homeless, and they will give you emergency benefits the same day.  If you have an apartment for a few more weeks or months, find a food bank.  As uncomfortable as it might make you, if you truly have no other options, make them formally evict you.  You will have an eviction on your record either way, so buy some more time that way.\n\nIf none of these options are possible, you need to use whatever time you have left to make a plan.  If you got a job tomorrow, could you afford rent?  If not, you have no reason to stay in that area.  Assuming you have no friends or family to stay with, you only have bad options:  Streets or shelter.  Both options suck.

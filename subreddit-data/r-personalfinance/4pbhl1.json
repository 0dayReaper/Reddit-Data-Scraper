    "postText": "My mom and her boyfriend left and took their stuff while I was at work today and our home is paid every month so I'm going to be kicked out on July 1. I don't know what to do. My mom used to be fine, but my dad killed himself 6 years ago. My mom didn't work but said that the Army was sending money because my dad was in Iraq. My mom started doing drugs and dating a guy who sells drugs. He beat me up sometimes and stole my stuff a lot, and he tried to take money out of my wallet yesterday when he was on drugs, and I stopped him and hit him back. Then he and my mom got in a fight and now they're both gone. What can I do? I'm going to be a senior next year and I don't want to leave my school. Can I get the Army to send me the money that they were sending my mom? Please help. Thank you.\n\nUpdate: Thanks everyone for the advice. I called my friend and his mom said that I can stay there as long as I need to, that's a huge relief. For people asking about where I am, I live in Camden New Jersey, and I am a boy. Also, we don't own a house. My mom had been renting a trailer for us. I was worried because I know that people have gotten locked out of their trailers for not paying and I thought that they would do that if I couldn't pay. Thank you all for your help.\n\nAnd I haven't heard from my mom, but she and her boyfriend took all of their stuff including the mattress out of the bedroom and the thing she kept her clothes and stuff in, so I know they just left, but I don't know where they went.\n\nUpdate again: Wow I don't know what to say. Thank you to everyone for all of your advice and offers to help. I am at a friend's house, I think I'm going to stay here for at least a little while. My friend's mom said I can stay as long as I need to and I cried and then she cried. I feel so much better, just a few hours ago I was really afraid and didn't know what I was going to do and now I feel like I am going to be OK. Thank you all so much.\n\nI don't know what I'm going to do about my mom yet, but I will update again if I figure that out.",

There are some serious consequences for what they've been doing. \n\nSecondly, reach out to any friends AND their parents to explain your situation and see if they would be willing to take you in. When I was growing up, there were a couple of people in my high school who did this. This is likely your best option to keep going to the same school and keep things \"relatively\" stable for you. Good luck OP. Sorry you're going through this.",

Asking for help is perfectly okay, as there are situations that are out of your control.  The best thing to do is take control of what you can (yourself) so that you can make rational decisions.  Then reach out to ones that you trust.  They may not fully understand how your situation got to where it is, but they will point you in the direction that you need to go.  \n",

Because I've been there, and done that.  Got HUGELY taken advantage of.  \n\nOP: if you do get into a situation where you're going to live with someone, DEFINITELY don't let yourself be taken advantage of, by THEM. Do it on YOUR terms.  Be clean. Be quiet. Be courteous.  If you CAN, get a job and offer to pay some rent.  Even if it's a small amount.  Something, anything, to get some skin in the game, so they don't come to feel like you owe them.  (for example: hang out with them do drugs and have sex.  Awful example - but that happens to kids in your situation!)  -- and looking at the other side: as someone who has taken in several wayward teens, I did not like it when they did not clean up after themselves, when they invited friends over when we weren't home - and did \"stuff\". (know what I mean?).  I did not like the one boy who stole stuff from us.  Or that while he was there, he dropped out of high school, and lied to us about it. He lied about getting a job.  He lied about not having any money - then spent money on tattoos.  Later, we found out that he had lied about his parents kicking him out:  he ran away from home because he didn't want to follow their rules.   OP: don't be that boy. You sound like a good kid, so keep your eye on your future, because that's what's at stake here. ",

It might seem cruel to turn in someone you care about but the \"punishment\" is far more of a help than you might think at first.  What's worse: getting some slaps on the wrist and being held in rehabilitation for a while or slowly dying from a hunger for substance that consumes you, your finances, your family, and all of your organs?  I'm going with option B here.  \"Turning her in\" is not trying to reprimand her but trying to help her.\n\nAnd as for the foster care, you can possibly avoid that by working with the police immediately and trying to arrange a place to stay with a friend or family.  For finding a friend, I know that's got to be rough since you might feel like a burden, but if you're polite and always willing to help out around the house you'll be seen as a part of the family and appreciated.\n*source: A bunch of years back a cousin of mine I never knew existed went into foster care because her parents were abusing drugs.  It was a weird adjustment but went fine at first.  She was always helpful and courteous and it was nice to have the company.  It only went sour when she started to become aggressive and rude.  She would regularly insult me and the sort.  After a while we had enough and requested her to be moved elsewhere.  If she'd stayed nice rather than turning into a c--- we wouldn't have had a single problem.  Just be a sweetheart and you'll do fine :)*",

Slept in a friends car through my senior year of high school and mainly couch surfed through college but was strictly focused on academics and sports, sometimes able to only eat every other day, but ended up with two STEM degrees and moved into a kick ass career that has been not only financially rewarded but intellectually as well.  \n\nI don't say this as any sort of chest thumping, but in hopes that it helps shed a light on a point of view that got me through all the obstacles I faced, I simply viewed it as life's shitty version of bootcamp. Life Bootcamp threw every crappy thing it could at me and it was just my job to endure and push forward.  It's not where you are now, but where you plan to be.  There's no shame in doing what you have to in order to achieve a goal.\n\nAbove all, none of it is your fault. It's just your job to move forward and win.\n\n*gets off soap box*\n",

My mom left my sister and I when we were very young but we were also lucky that my dad stepped in and took care of us. But it was tough as a kid growing up and watching other kids with both parents and seeing how a *real family* interacts. As a kid, I couldn't help but wonder if we were too much of a pain in the ass and that's what forced our mom to leave. The doubts and embarrassment eat you up inside. I know this - I have been there.  \n\nBut none of this is your fault, none of it. You're also not being dumb for any of the things that you're feeling - the person you should be able to trust most in life has betrayed that trust in the most absolute way possible. There is not a \"correct\" way to react to something like that.  \n\nI hope everything works out for you.",

My mom had been doing drugs, hooked up with a 19 year old (I was 17) and let him move in with us while she worked midnights. I left home thinking that would scare her into making him leave. It did not.  I moved in with my friend and his family thinking it would be short term and I never went home. I went away to college and have since grown up (37 now) but I think of them as my parents. They were very understanding and kind and we are still very close. My friend that I moved in with is like my brother.  Reach out to a friend and his/her parents.  People are very compassionate.",

You are supposed to have a home to help you. Your mother has failed in that, and I'm so, so sorry.\n\n\nSocial services will help you. Social services **does** **not** **want** to tear you away from your life. They sometimes get made out to be \"the bad guys,\" but that's not the goal AT ALL. The goal is to help you find a safe place to live where you will be comfortable and can succeed. That, for you, is definitely going to mean staying in your school, in your community. Since you are almost an adult, they **will** listen to you and take your feelings into consideration. They will help you find somewhere safe to be where you don't have to worry about food, shelter, or getting beat up.\n\nWhat you really need to do is talk to some of your friends (and ideally, your friends' parents) and see if they would let you come live with them for the next year, since I'm guessing that would be the least stressful and most ideal place for you. \n\nYou need help. You can get it. You will be **shocked** at how many people will be willing and able to open their hearts and homes to you. You will be **shocked** at how much help and support you can get, but you have to tell people your problems. \n\n**You have done nothing wrong.** You are a *victim.* This is not how parents are supposed to treat their children. Your mother made a deal when she had you; that deal was to take care of you. She has failed. Other people will help correct her mistake.\n\nPlease don't be embarrassed. This is not your fault. This is you getting caught in the crossfire of a bunch of other people's shit.\n\nWhere in the country do you live?\n",

Again, assuming the situation is similar in NJ, they will look at housing you first with relatives or trusted family (these people will have to be trustworthy of course, they won't sign off on questionable people), next they would look at foster homes that are appropriate to you and near your home area. Don't be afraid of social services. They get a bad rap because people only tell the shitty stories where their kids get removed, but they get removed for a reason, and no one ever tells the stories of \"social services came in, helped me clean up my act, and my kids are better off for it\".\n\nNext, I'd like to say that you seem smart and resourceful. Good job, and continue to lean on that. This will not be an easy few years for you, so forget any \"why me\" stuff, and focus on working hard in school and in whatever you're passionate about. **Stay away from trouble.** Statistically, your situation places you in an at-risk demographic. Use that knowledge and guide yourself. Trust the responsible adults in your life. Get a good start and by the time you're in your twenties, you'll have ample time to have fun and enjoy life. You still do now, you just need to be careful and stay on track.\n\nI also encourage you to accept any offers for counselling or friendly ears to lean on. You have a total and absolute right to be pissed right now. This sucks and it's not your fault. But, try and use your anger and hurt, turn into a fire that'll fuel you being fucking awesome and conquering life. Many people forget that you can do that, and let it burn them up.\n\nLast idea: perhaps reach out to some of your father's army people. From my limited understanding of the military, the brotherhood there might compel them to help you in small or big ways.\n\nGood luck, and keep your head up, this too shall pass.",

They will help you find somewhere safe to be where you don't have to worry about food, shelter, or getting beat up.\n\nWhile this is certainly true, he runs the risk of not being placed locally, which is why I told him to try to get his friends mom to agree to foster him until he graduates before contacting them.  Social services first priority is to keep him safe, even if it means uprooting him to place him in a foster home, so you just can't be sure.\n\nsource - wife was a CASA, have been foster parents, currently foster adopting.",

Mostly just intimidation and threats of violence, occasionally shoved me or my mom, one time threw a glass at me which shattered all over my chest. He lost his job because his drinking problems made him worse at work, and at one point stole my entire savings ($2000) at the time, since I hadn't thought to revoke his access to my account. Overall, home life was miserable.\n\nCompounding it was the fact that I was really bitter and angry most of the time in high school, and didn't have many friends, I was really reluctant to reach out to anyone but finally did because I was starting to fail classes (after previously being a straight A student). I told basically my only 2 friends and their parents what was going on and it was really helpful, despite being embarrassing at first. Both families offered to let me crash at their places any time, which I did take them up on a few times on bad nights. Helped me get through my senior year with passing grades, get into a decent college, and recover from some of the damage. To this day one set of parents email me regularly to check in (I'm 24 now, this all went down when I was 17-18).\n\nI'm so sorry you have to go through this, I can't relate to your exact experience but I know how awful it is to have your parents fail to be responsible adults. Something that really has helped me cope over the years is the concept of \"strength through adversity\", basically using this awful experience as something that you can learn from and make yourself a better person from. Once you get out on your own and aren't reliant on an unreliable mother, your life *will* get better.",

I had to leave home because my dad sexually abused me.  I had a friend's family take me in. Don't be embarrassed about your situation.  This isn't your fault. You are a kid.  As sad and as harsh as it may seem, but your situation  is a result of your mother's irresponsibility.   Things do get better. Keep your head up and on the straight and  narrow. If you can,  go for some counselling or therapy. ",

But you should understand that *she* is responsible for her own actions. The boyfriend isn't controlling her mind and forcing her to do these things.\n\nYour #1 concern and your top priority should be taking care of yourself. It's noble that you want to help your mom, too, but you can't. Your mom needs to come to terms with the consequences of her addiction to have any chance at beating it, and there are only two ways you can create those consequences for her: by involving the authorities (in which case, if you're a minor, your mom's behavior will be evaluated to determine if it constitutes abuse) or by discreetly running away (in which case you need somewhere to go). But if you run away and are a minor, understand that it will be a long road to emancipation or eighteen, whichever comes first in your state, and not having a legal guardian available might make things a bit difficult for you at some stages.\n\nBut I want to reiterate one thing: there is no \"if she could stop doing drugs\". That's not on the table, and you can't undo the years of history that are behind her. *Do not* count on her to do the right thing. Addiction is incredibly powerful, and you can't do much at all to fight it for her from the outside.\n\nYou're in a crappy situation, and it will help you *a lot* if you can just confess to yourself that the situation sucks but is real. Living in denial about your mom's condition and her recent behavior will only make you vulnerable to being hurt more. Take care of yourself, and don't even so much as lift a finger to help her unless she's asking for help specifically with beating her addiction. It's not that you shouldn't care about her; rather, you need to protect yourself from her exploiting your emotional state.",

He probably has warrants though--addicts usually do. But in the end, that isn't going to change the boyfriend, your mom, or your situation. And you aren't going to see any of the money he stole from you, either. \n\nAnd even if he goes to jail, your mom will continue to do drugs. The boyfriend is not the cause--he is a symptom. Your mom will only quit drugs when SHE wants to. Yes, she might get sent to court-mandated rehab, but that doesn't mean that she won't start using the day she gets out. No one can \"make\" an addict quit. They have to want to do it.\n\nSorry, I know that's not what you wanted to hear. But you cannot \"fix\" your mom. Just make your life the best it can be.

I set my own hours and work for myself. Work never follows me home since I need my hands to do it, and there's never any unpaid hours. If you're not sure about what you want to dedicate your life to, dedicate your short term time to a trade skill and make some great money while you wait to figure it out.\n\nIf you're curious I do electrician work, and I'm getting into plumbing next year.

I went from being an airline mechanic to an airline maintenance manager. Slightly more money for twice as much work and stress. I ended up going back to school and now I'm doing engineering work which is pretty fun. The one word of caution about learning a trade is to try to find one that won't wear your body out by the time you're 40. My buddy made a ton doing underwater welding but nobody can last more than 5-10 years and then you have to change careers.",

My husband passed away in active duty 5 years ago and they were just INVALUABLE.

So really great job just starting out :-)\n\n\n\nI want to echo the people who suggest going to the police (they will help you get in touch with social services which is basically a public safety net program with housing/food/other resources for people - with priority to people under 18). But if that sounds like something you might need some support to do (I know I would) it might be easier to contact a trusted friend and/or friend's parent to be there with you while you contact and work with the police. \"Moral support\" is very real and it can help you through things that are intimidating or confusing.\n\n\n\nI know you feel embarrassed by your situation - but everyone else you tell about this (us, friends, friends' parents, police, social services) will want to help you -- and they will NOT judge you. They will likely not think very highly of your mom's boyfriend, or possibly your mom. But I hope you can let go of that embarrassment because you don't deserve it. Focus on respecting yourself, and connecting yourself with people who will help you. Because help is something you definitely DO deserve. \n\n\nWhen we humans are put into circumstances like yours, we come out different. I have confidence that you will come out on top. Wishing you all the luck and good fortune in the world. &lt;3 ",

You've gotten tons of good advice but please let me be one more person to emphasize that this isn't your fault and has nothing to do with you. Your mom has issues that only she can choose to fix (which go way beyond the boyfriend); it may sound harsh, but you need to worry about yourself and your future. If she decides to turn her life around, awesome - let her earn her way back into yours but NOT until you're secure. BTDT - don't let her back in until you're solid, okay?\n\nMy dad died when I was in elementary school. My mom was always a drinker but went off the rails without him around to keep her in check. She collected the social security that was meant for me and didn't bother to pay the bills on the house, leaving us without utilities or food most of the time. She started to date men looking for someone to take care of her and then one day, I came home and all my stuff was on the lawn. I was 13. She told me that she had to choose - her new dude or me. It was obvious what her choice was and since she was so wasted, I just collected my things and went to a friend's house. I ended up living with an older sibling for high school and still have a bad relationship with my mom to this day (obvs).\n\nMost of what I regret is that I tried so hard to make my mom see that she was hurting me (and all of us) and that we wanted better for her. Don't spend your energy trying to fix other people - it becomes a destructive habit that sucks all the good out of your own life. ",

Also, once you get that coming to you, it usually ends when you turn 18 but I'm pretty sure you can apply to have it continue until you graduate high school. \n\nYour immediate move is to look for a safe place to stay while you get everything sorted out, but definitely look into these sources of funds, it'll go a long way towards your long-term support. \n\nFor both of these, and any other money you earn or receive, open a checking account in your name only (or if you have to be 18 find a trusted adult to put their name on there) and have the payments direct deposited so no shenanigans happen.

            "comment": "I feel for you. You are going to go through something very hard. Don't let your mothers poor decisions ruin your life. You are better off this way then if she stuck around and messed up your life for the next 5-10. Your mom and her boyfriend have left to live somewhere else but may return at any moment.\n\nTake all the advice on this thread and mash it together. No one is totally wrong or totally right. As someone who has worked with kids/had friends in bad situations:\n\n1. This is not your fault, but its time to rally resources. You don't want to live on the street, now, or later. Your current resources are: you, your reputation, and your belongings. You need to add: adults and the legal system to get housing and eventually money and independence. You should take all your valuable, including pictures, now, pack them and find somewhere to stay/keep them. Whatever in the house is fair game to be sold for drugs by them. You can use a school locker, a friends house, a gym, maybe even a police or fire station if you explain to them whats going on. If you can get your social security card/birth certificate bonus points for you. I have firefighters in the family, and I know if a soon to be homeless kid wanted to stash his bag for a few days to protect his stuff from a drug addict mom, they won ld totally put it in a drawer or locker..as long as it was \"kid stuff\" and didn't have anything possibly illegal or stolen in it (drugs, jewelry etc). Find a place to stay ASAP. Talk to CPS as soon as possible. See below.\n\n2. Let your school know what is going on. They can help you. Contact the VA and SS, see if you qualify for any benefits. You likely need to emancipate yourself. This really helps for paperwork/loans/scholarships. You will need to work with CPS, Child Protection Services. Resources to get you in touch with CPS are: school, police department, Children's Hospital/Children's Emergency Department.\n3. When police and CPS are involved, its going to make a lot of hassle for you and your mom. It may even limit step 4; CPS may want you placed with family you don't like etc etc. Just keep that in mind you may need to convince CPS of certain things and be involved in decisions as much as you can be. You can trust them, but don't let them do everything on autopilot...you may not get what you want/the best situation. \n4. See if a friend's (or even someone you know) family can take you in longer term. If you work, help pay your way, don't get arrested/in trouble, help clean, have a plan for life etc...they'd probably love to have you, especially if you explain the situation. Real adults are understanding people, but you need to show that you will benefit their household and not be a burden. If you don't have a good reputation, you are going to have sell yourself a little..dress nice, letters from people you know/school, etc etc. This is your best bet to not have to leave your HS.\n5. If you can't stay with anyone or will not be a \"good tenant\", you may end up living where you do not want to live. Being a \"good tenant\" is now priority #1. That means doing well and having your stuff together. \n6. You need to come up with a life plan. Don't worry, it can change later. But you need a goal...most people won't let you live with them forever or pay for you to go to/apply to college. I recommend either \"graduate, get a job, move out, go to community college\" or \"the military\" as plans.\n\nWhen trying to find someone to stay with, imagine it from their point of view. They want to help you, but its a risk. If you say and show \"I am clean cut, plan on working part time and/or will do chores until I finish high school, at which point I have a plan to become independent. I get VA benefits and SS, so I can save money. I don't listen to loud music, get in trouble and am home on time\" then parents will be willing to help you. If you have no idea what to do, you are asking them to basically figure out your life for you..and they may not be equipped to handle that or want to get involved. \n\nA couple last bits of advice: You are going to go through a lot of feelings when this happens, depending on how much support you get and how you feel about your mom. Don't be afraid to talk to someone or keep a journal. Your mom is not the person she was when she raised you; she is a now addicted to drugs and can't make good decisions. But she is an adult and is responsible for her own decisions...so don't screw yourself trying to spare her. She is not going to help you during this important part of your life. She may come back, call you etc..put yourself #1 and keep the authorities involved. If she wants to be in your life, she can't have access to your housing, belongings, or money.\n\nI saw you mentioned this is embarrassing. You have to remember this is not your fault, and doesn't reflect on you, as much as you think it does. I don't know your social situation at school, but I can say that many kids won't make fun of you, and even more won't if they realize adults are taking it seriously...even HS kids know some things are never appropriate for jokes. You might be surprised...some bullies might even identify with you if their home is messed up too.\n\nSome questionable advice from me: If there is anything valuable in the house that is not yours, it is at risk to be sold for drugs or stolen by druggy friends or even your landlord. I would hide it very well in the house, but not steal it. Once you are legally allowed to return to the house to take things, they should still be there for you. I am not sure if this legal.\n \n\n",

Except in my case my parents threw me out because they were divorcing and didn't want an additional custody issue to complicate it since I would be an adult soon anyway. I had 10 min to get my stuff and leave. I was raised on stories of my fathers time \"in the system\" when he was a kid so I didn't make any attempt to get help from the authorities at the time. My parents had already started telling the neighbors that they threw me out because I hit my stepmother. I figured the story from my parents would lead to me spending the remainder of my time as a minor in Juvie, if I attempted to go to the authorities.\n\n So instead I did as many here have suggested and appealed to the parents of some of my friends. Don't rely on that. They can drop you at any time, and if anything about you being there leads to an additional expense or inconvenience (which is inevitable as a condition of being a human with basic needs) they can and likely will.\n\n Don't make my mistake, go to the authorities right away. You will need help. If you try to skate by on the goodwill of your friends families, you may come to regret it as it will likely be very temporary. If you wind up waiting till you are 18 to petition the government for help like I did, they will not help you, especially since you are now an adult male. You will wind up being homeless with little in the way of options out of it. Go to social services right away.",

Family really is not all that important, it's just random people you end up with. \n\nWhat your mom did doesn't reflect on your worth as a person at all, it only reflects on her. Maybe one day she'll wise up, maybe one day you'll forgive her, maybe you'll never see her again. The important part is for you to remember that you're a good, valuable person, who deserves good things in life, who deserves love and success, and you'll be thankful for the struggle and the pain in your life one day, because it'll give you a depth and an inner strength that others will enjoy and lean on for the years to come, until you get your own family some day.

You have a LOT going on, so don't make this a priority, but don't forget to look into this one day. Never forgive her for doing this to you. Be gracious and thankful to those that help you. You're going to be great. Excited for your future. keep us all in the loop!",

Please know you don't have to figure everything out by yourself.\n\nCall the police and tell them what you just told us. You were assaulted and have a right to file a police report. You are a minor (I'm assuming, since you're a rising senior), so they will contact child services to help figure out where to go from here. There are many services available to help out unaccompanied youth, but you may need to advocate for yourself to make sure you get access to them. Please know that you most likely have a legal right to stay in your same school, even if you end up staying someplace that is technically no longer in district (according to the Mckinney Vento Act and The Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015).\n\nCheck out:\n\n* [The National Association for the Education of Homeless Youth](http://www.naehcy.org/educational-resources/youth)\n* [Youth.gov](http://youth.gov/youth-topics/runaway-and-homeless-youth/federal-definitions)\n",

Start with the police and work from there. School is a great resource. It's full of people that just want to help kids. \n\nYou asked for help! You are already so far ahead of so many kids in similar situations!",

Unfortunately, whatever you do .... life is going to suck for a while. Social services can keep you fed and dry.\n\nOne day you are going to be responsible for other people, maybe even kids. I hope you look back at this time and be a stand-up guy... never let the people relying on you to have to go through what you are going through now.\n\nI'm sorry this sucks. All I can say is keep your head down and stay smart. Take care of those weaker than you and remember that things will get better.\n\nGod bless.",

            "comment": "having diverse strategies can help spread out your risk, for sure.\n\nfor example, you could have one account focused on long-term growth, another for short-term gains, and maybe even a third for safe, low-risk investments (which it seems like you already have) - it all depends on your goals and risk tolerance.\n\nf you decide to go with different investment strategies across accounts, it's important to stay on top of market trends and news. Since your investments are more diverse, you'll want to keep a close eye on any big news events or shifts in the market. i typically get my news from the [financial times](https://www.ft.com/products) ($69 a month) or the [investing journal](https://www.investingjournal.gg/) (free)",

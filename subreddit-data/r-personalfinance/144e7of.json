    "postText": "My fianc\u00e9 and I were working with just my income for a two and a half years and I managed to rack up about $7K on credit cards, not counting a CareCredit account that's 0% interest that he's paying for. Now he's got an income and I'm going back to school. My job provides a decent amount of tuition reimbursement for the classes themselves, so would it make sense to use the FAFSA money to pay off my credit cards and then pay that back instead?",

With the federal student loans I get a certain amount and I don't really get to choose how much. I could either pay back most of the student loan immediately, or use the loan to pay off all of my CC debt, then pay back the student loan when it comes due.",

However, taking out the full amount and using that to live on while you pay the CC debit is probably a good idea as the interest rate on the loans is much lower than CC interest. The only time where it would be a bad idea is if you could pay the CC very soon without the loan. \n\nJust take note about the wording of my comment, you are not allowed to use student loans to pay off CC debit, but you can use it for living expenses, ya dig?",

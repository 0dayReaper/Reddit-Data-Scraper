    "postText": "Hello! \n\nI've just started my first real job, and I am trying to fill out a form for a simple IRA plan. I have to choose the investment options, but I'm not sure what the options are. The company that does the IRAs uses netxinvestor, so if anyone knows if there are options listed somewhere on the website, or has any other advice, I would appreciate it! My employer also matches 3%, so I figured I would just start with that.",

Other than that, there's a portfolio tab and a research tab. But I've looked through them and there doesn't seem to be options I can look at. I can search for different securities in a search bar though. I found pershing.com/rates - would something like be what I'm looking for? If I choose three options and contribute 1% to each?",

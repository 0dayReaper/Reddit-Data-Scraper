I suggest taking maybe a practice test outside of Khan Academy to really test your skills.\n\nFor Khan Academy, at least from my experience (I course plan for English in a tutoring center), the biggest issue is that it\u2019s pretty much entirely self-motivated. You need to WANT to do it, and most students from my experience simply don\u2019t want to do the work. Or they think that just having the answers is enough. I mean, yes, I\u2019m in a tutoring center and no student ever wants to be there, but that logic also applies to Khan Academy. I\u2019ve seen students really use it well to the point where Ive asked parents why their student was even here (friendly and jokingly, of course) and told their parents to stop coming because they didn\u2019t need the help since they\u2019re doing it well on their own. And I\u2019ve seen kids use it and do worse. The reason for that is because online education like BYU or OHS, even though they follow a curriculum, might not get into as much detail on certain concepts than if you had a teacher or tutor who can see and anticipate what you might need help on. There is that missing disconnect of making mistakes and learning that is lost if a student doesn\u2019t self-analyze well. I have the same opinion about Khan Academy even though it seems much more detailed than other resources. Students who do self-analyze their learning weakness well, use Khan Academy wonderfully. \n\nEverything I\u2019ve said is a personal opinion, one that I do share with parents for the honesty because I believe that for education you HAVE to be honest. I don\u2019t want any students in my center that don\u2019t need to be there and I wish some certain other tutoring centers can say the same. So I\u2019ll give my opinion as well as other options as well. At the end of the day, students gotta use what works best for them.\n\nThe biggest scam though, is that the tests for SAT they have for free are the same tests you can buy in the SAT book. As far as I know, the answer explanations are the same.",

There would be no point in going through the motions just to look up the answers. I'll redo unit tests anywhere between 5-10 times until I have 100% in the unit. That being said, I know it's definitely not a replacement for school curriculum. I'm actually taking an Algebra 1 class next semester anyways, so I'll be redoing basically everything I'm doing now. The problem with online tests though is that I can never find any answer keys to match with them, so if I'm doing word problems there's really no way for me to check if I'm right. \n\nAlso speaking of the SAT, I also saw that they have the NCLEX nursing entrance exam practice as well as MCAT med school entrance exam practice. Would you say they're of the same quality of exam prep that people pay for? I was shook when I saw it on the website because I know people pay good money for those practice tests.",

My doubt only comes from past students ahaha. I gotta see the results first ahah. Don\u2019t think of that Algebra 1 class as a repeat, everything you\u2019re doing now is preparing for that class. Any difficulties you encounter now most likely would\u2019ve been difficulties during the class, so practicing now gives you that preemptive angle. Of course, you might still encounter difficulties after all that practice but you\u2019ll be better able to specify where you need help. Full disclaimer: this is all my pedagogy, of course. For the online tests, I suggest finding a friend you trust in the subject. You could also go to a tutoring center, but that will cost money and at the end of the day unless you have the answer key there could be that doubt. \n\nUnfortunately, my knowledge ends after SAT/SAT2/ACT and going a little into college. So I\u2019m not particular useful for your questions regarding NCLEX and MCAT. Although, finding out the company could help you out a little. Khan Academy is part of CollegeBoard or works very closely with them (I believe the CEO or president helped or something) - I don\u2019t remember the exact details of the relationship, but that\u2019s part of the reason Khan Academy has the SAT tests Collegeboard makes. So, if NCFLEX and MCAT are Collegeboard (which I doubt) then it would be reasonable to think those tests would be on par on Khan Academy. That\u2019s insane logic and I recommend NOT going into it. \n\nAt the end of the day, for the standardized tests (and I guess everything in general but specifically), the best way to get better at the test is to practice the tests. Every test is different, but the question types are the same (and obviously in different numbers; one test might have three specific types, but on the next or previous it might have had only two of that specific type.) You wanna make sure the conceptual foundation is good. The test is kinda like testing you in your ability to follow directions but also apply that knowledge in a variety of ways. It\u2019s also why Khan Academy exists, they believe that for this purpose the ability to prepare for the tests should be free. And truthfully, it makes sense Which is a rant in itself.\n\nKeep up the great work! I hope to hear about your progress in the future!",

The co.plexity come from stacking and combination of old formulas into one, it's not Ac. Sci. but know if your bad at higher math levels it might be challenging.  Not all your courses will evolve around it but your hardest ones will.\n\nAccounting: This field is doesnt involve math if you can add/subtract/multiply you have the math skills.  It's a lot more about learning rules and procedures and balancing.  I'd say a bit more thought involved in how you use the process.  (Do not I have interned for accounting and finance and the finance work involved a lot more intuitive thinking than the acc. which was more set by guidelines/rules)\n\nEconomics: I have several close friends who majored here and have used a few of my electives on it so I'll give what I know.  Plenty of formula math again, not quite to the same level as finance courses but it's nothing to scoff at.  LOTS of theory and hypothetical discussion, it very much will feel like an academic degree in some ways.\n\nHope that can help you a bit.",

If it's the former (public speaking definitely take a look at that). Another group you can check out is \"Toastmasters\" (there may even be a group at your university) you get up in front of the group regularly and speak about something assigned or you made up and then people grade you and at the end of the meeting they give awards for like best speech etc. Sounds cheesy, but it definitely helps build confidence having to regularly step out of your comfort zone which can most definitely translate into being a better networker. I make sure I get as many LinkedIn connections as I can of people I actually meet (unless I work at the same location I dont request random strangers). But a few times I have researched a company and found that someone worked there was a 2nd connection of mine so I reached out to my 1st and asked them to introduce me and that was my \"in\" to get a feel for the company, possibly even a reccomendation.",

Hahahahaha I was dumb. Anyway yes the problem is generational and systemic and will take big changes to improve across society, in an economy that relies on debt to function. Long story short I don't have any answers. I just will do my small part and try to bring my kids up differently, smarter than me.",

Then she made us decide between renting a house or buying one, if we wanted to have cable TV and WiFi, and if it was convenient to buy the TV-Internet-Phone package places like Comcast offer. There was other things involved, like what happens if you got to the hospital and you don't have health insurance or my personal favorite: how much a baby costs you in its first year of life (around $30k, depending on a few factors). \n\nIt was awesome, super useful and very eye opening. It definitely ignited my interest in personal finance and what I needed to keep in mind before making those big life choices.",

There's some opportunity to reduce expenses here though; there's always parents whose children have grown up that are desperate to get rid of old baby clothes. Also, you could opt for using reusable (washable) nappies.\n\nMedical costs wise, you need to take your child to the pediatrician to see if they're growing well and meeting their normal benchmarks. I think you also need to get some vaccinations in the first year too.\n\nWhen it comes to daycare, it depends on whether you have a stay-at-home spouse or family you can rely on for childcare once you go back to work. If not, you'll need to invest in daycare which gets really expensive.",

My husband got no financial advice at all, his family was too polite to talk about money. I was lucky to read a book on personal finances in my early 20s, it has made a world of difference.  It is criminal to withhold this information from kids.",

The only interesting lesson was compound interest. It's not the school's responsibility, it's parent's. I wish my parents would have forced me to make a simple budget as soon as I got an allowance.

It mostly focused on setting a budget, how to handle your income, how to write checks, and how to balance a checkbook......so it was outdated, but still useful.\n\nHowever, most kids don't worry about any of this again until after they graduate High School,and luckier kids don't worry about it until after college. By that point, they've forgotten everything they learned in that class.\n\nWhat helped me more than anything? Was actually the lazy coach that 'taught' economics class by having a Dave Ramsey video play the entire class. While I disagree with some of Ramsey's points, it still got me interested in how personal finance works, and led to me doing my own independent reading, internet searching, and basic research. It also made me know what questions to ask. My father was a blue collared worker with a pension, and absolutely no one in my social circle had a plan for retirement outside of saving money in a savings account. Ramsey changed that for me.\n\nSo you can preach personal finance all you want to, but in the end, you really need the \"Bill Nye' effect to get people to realize that it can be interesting.",

I taught 7th &amp; 8th grade math. In 8th grade alone they are taught how to calculate simple and compound interest, compare loan length and interest rates, identify assets and liabilities and calculate net worth, budget and identify fiscal irresponsibility, estimate and create a savings plan for the costs of college, and more. Then the personal financial literacy class in high school teaches them how to do taxes and create a budget. Before 8th grade, they've learned borrowing, lending, and saving as far back as 2nd grade, and taxes have been covered in 5th grade. This isn't optional, this is mandated in the Texas standards. Most states are similar, and have been for a while.    \n\nIt's not a school problem, it's a parenting problem. Schools are teaching it. Students aren't caring or paying attention because parents aren't bothering to follow up at home with providing kids with opportunities to participate and practice the skills they're being taught. When their first grader comes home talking about producers and consumers they don't bother bringing it up in the grocery store. When their fifth grader comes home talking about income tax, they don't bother showing them how that affects their paychecks. Both of those examples are real TEKS, by the way, and required to be taught in that grade level.",

Also, they tend to stick \"personal finance\" outside of the standard high school math curriculum because it's seen as \"basic math,\" which a lot of students won't take because they won't get college credit for it unlike AP/IB math courses. The math you use in personal finance is mostly basic math (e.g. arithmetic), but I find it's more of a state of mind. You have to change people's attitudes about math and personal finance before they can start absorbing any of the material you're trying to teach.",

Do you know how many high schoolers pick a college without really thinking about the price in the long run, only to get disappointed when their parents say they have to either choose a cheaper one or go to a community college and then transfer? \n\nIt also should fall upon the parents to teach their kids these things. My parents say I should save up and buy a house or an apartment, but refuse to talk about our house finances (they've slowly started telling me when I ask, but I'm out of college now--this information would have been a bit useful when I was entering college. Even if I didn't care, I'd least I'd have a general idea of a savings goal--excluding inflation). \n\nAlso a lot of adults laugh that current generations don't know how to write a check--instead of laughing, just explain it in a non jackass way. Very rarely do people my age use checks (I'm 22) but it's good to know how to fill one out on the rare instant you can't get to a bank and you have to give money asap (like for a down-payment on a house or something--doubt they take venmo).",

    "postText": "Hi finance friends, I am very aware that withdrawing from my Roth IRA early is not the best financial move. I have already decided to withdraw my contributions and have sold my investments. I am not asking for advice about wether it\u2019s a good decision or not. I am asking for clarification about the early withdraw rules. I sold my investments for what I initially bought them for so I am breaking even. My question is does it now count as investment income or may I withdraw my contributions tax free as if I never invested them?",

            "comment": "For purposes of withdrawing contributions, the IRS simply looks at the number of dollars that went into the IRA and the number of dollars coming out.  It does not matter what happened in between, what those dollars bought while inside the IRA or how those investments grew/shrank.  Selling anything within an IRA is invisible to IRS.  They don't care whether you profited a lot, lost a lot, or broke even.  No part of that transaction is a taxable event.\n\nAll the IRS needs to be told is that you put $6000 into your IRA last year (or really anytime in the past) and made a $6000 withdrawal this year.  Since withdrawal &gt; contribution, this simply reduces the \"basis\" in the IRA (the total of all your past Roth IRA contributions), and the withdrawn money is treated as untaxed and has no penalty.",

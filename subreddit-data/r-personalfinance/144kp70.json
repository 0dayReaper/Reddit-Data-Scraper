    "postText": "I have been doing a family HSA plan with my employer for a few years now. Since I carry my children I am allowed to do the $7,750 even though my wife can't be on my plan due to spousal carve out rules. My employer contributes ~$1,000.00 to my HSA maximum each year. I do max out the HSA every year even though I don't really spend it right now as I'm trying to make the most out of the triple tax advantage growth and don't plan to use it unless I have to until I reach retirement.\n\nMy wife has entered a new place of employment and they will also contribute ~$1,000.00 towards an HSA. I want to capitalize on this free contribution. Does she have to open up a brand new HSA account specifically under her name and then I would have to switch to a 'singles' account as well or can we keep our existing family HSA account and have both employers both deposit into that existing family HSA account and just modify my contributions downward so we still stay within the $7,750.00 yearly limit? What are my options?\n\nApply Taxes flair as I think this is more related to tax laws then investing.",

If the employer offers 1000, they will likely set the account themselves. \n\n&gt; and then I would have to switch to a 'singles' account as well\n\nNo. You already have one. \n\n&gt;  or can we keep our existing family HSA account \n\nThere is no such thing as a family HSA account. \n\n&gt; and have both employers both deposit into that existing family HSA account \n\nNo. \n\n&gt; and just modify my contributions down\n\nYes. For 2023, you and your wife are allowed to contribute 7,750 total across all HSA accounts including any employer contributions.",

            "comment": "Even though you are covered by a family HDHP, there is really no such thing as a \"family HSA\". It is an individually-owned account. If she enrolls in a separate HDHP through her employer, they will only be able to make contributions to an HSA opened in her name.\n\nThe two of you combined cannot exceed the $7750 family contribution limit, regardless of how the contributions are split between you. So if she follows through on this and receives the $1000 contribution from her employer to her HSA, you will only be able to contribute $6750 to your HSA.",

            "comment": "HSA contribution limits are determined by who owns the account and their coverage level.  A given HSA can only have one owner.  Since you own your HSA and have coverage under a family HDHP (you + kids), then you get to put up to $7750 into it for 2023.  But there's one big catch: for married couples who each have an HSA, the IRS limits the two of you to that $7750 limit **in total**, and this includes any employer contribution done \"on your behalf\".  \n\nMost likely, to get that $1000 employer contribution from her new job, your wife would have to have an HSA in her name.  She'll probably get one as part of her overall health benefits.  I'm pretty sure it wouldn't be allowed for them to contribute on her behalf into your existing HSA since she is not that account's owner, you are.\n\nI'd say the simplest path would be something like this:\n\n* She opens her own HSA through her employer, and gets their $1000 put into that.  Since she will only have individual coverage (unless you choose to split up kids between the two plans), she'll be limited to no more than $3850 into her HSA.  If her employer does a \"match\" style contribution, she may need to have some of her pay go into her HSA.\n* You keep your existing HSA.  Since your joint contribution is still limited by the $7750 limit, you'd need to scale down your contributions to account for the \"extra\" $1000 going into your wife's HSA, along with whatever amount (if any) of her pay goes into her HSA.\n\nHSA payments/reimbursements are eligible for the owner + owner's spouse + owner's dependents, so whatever money is in those two accounts can be used to pay medical expenses for anyone in your household; even for someone on a completely different plan than the owner.",

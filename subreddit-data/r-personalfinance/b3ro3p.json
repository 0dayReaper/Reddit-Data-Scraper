    "postText": "I won't bring up the specific details, but long story short, my parents are legitimately crazy, one of those extreme situations where everything I do must be kept secret (talking to friends, working a normal job, etc).\n\nLuckily in the middle of last year I got a job with my brother, he told my parents he would not pay me, then paid me in secret. Since then I have about 10k saved up, but recently they have made it very difficult to even work because I am assuming they somehow figured out I am being paid. Because of this, I will likely lose my job and my income, however, I do have experience working with people, writing resumes, doing interviews, so I don't think getting another job will be super difficult. The main issue for me is how can I get out of this house as quickly as possible? For a while I thought that maybe these things my parents do were normal, but the more I am exposed to the real world (mostly through the internet, which I had very little access to until about 2 years ago) I found out these things are in fact extreme and unusual.\n\nFor a bit more context, I am 17, no car, no license (parents won't let me get one), no friends who would be willing to let me live with them (socializing was very hard because I was homeschooled) I have a associate's degree and as I said, 10k saved up. Whats my best course of action to get away?\n\nEdit: there are a lot of comments and I am sorry I can't reply to all of them, I'm using an old phone I found to make this post so I can't be seen with it, I just want to say thank you all for the advice given, I don't have any mentors so all this honestly helps. Your kindness means the world to me and I will make sure to read every comment.",

Also, FREEZE YOUR CREDIT (if you have any established)\n\nUse the credit bureau websites to check your credit; depending on how crazy your parents are, you may find that they've interfered with your credit by opening accounts in your name. THIS IS FRAUD and you should immediately file a police report if you find this is the case.\n\nGood luck, man. You're in a better place than most of your age. You'll make it fine.\n\nEDIT: oooh... So shiney, that silver! Danke!",

Also look at Airbnb monthly rentals, efficiency apartments, and extended stay hotels- ymmv in terms of cost in your area, but they can be reasonably priced and give you the month to month flexibility you\u2019ll need while figuring things out initially. \n\n\\- if you're already interested, give a hard look at things like college or the military, where they take care of food and housing for you.\n\nEdit: added some housing options as suggested below.

To obtain a certified birth certificate at our office, you will need to have the following information available when you arrive:\n\n1.     The child's full name as stated on the birth certificate\n\n2.     The mother's full MAIDEN name\n\n3.     The child's date of birth\n\n4.     The child's place of birth\n\nFor a regular certified copy, you will need to sign a sworn statement, under penalty of perjury, that you are an authorized person.\n\nThen with the birth certificate and some proof of residency you should get yourself a CA state ID.  Also as someone who was on her own decades ago , I recommend finding a place to live with others who have already signed a lease who want to rent a room to you.  Less pressure for you and many landlords will not want to rent to an 18 yr old.  Much easier to find a couple or family that will let you lease a room.  Go check it out in person, make sure that they actually have right to lease to you, as there are so many scams on Craigslist now.  Good luck .",

And when you have crazy parents, oftentimes even after you physically free yourself and more things are in your control, there\u2019s a lot of mental unpacking to do. Allow yourself the emotional room to do that in your own time. \n\n\nTry therapy; there are places that offer supervised therapy with trainees for very little money compared to your traditionally accredited psych or LMFT. Or online therapy like Talkspace. Do not go to a psychic or any other \u201cspiritual\u201d doctor, that may sound silly but in some communities that stuff is rife and it\u2019s especially not good for people who are trying to sort through their trauma.\n\n\nAlso once you have some solid friends you can trust, don\u2019t be afraid to open up. If you\u2019re struggling, don\u2019t bottle up your emotions. Let people help you. That being said, don\u2019t fall into a situation where you financially or emotionally rely on anyone else more than yourself. This is your time to cultivate self-reliance.\n\n\nGoing back to the original point though, yes you have been a victim of growing up with crazy parents. But that doesn\u2019t define you. You shouldn\u2019t expect any sort of compensation or special treatment because of that. Be careful about making excuses because of that. Everyone\u2019s timeline of accomplishments looks different. Just be your best self. There\u2019s a difference between confiding in people about your struggles and whining about how life isn\u2019t fair to anyone who will listen. Choose the former.\n\nAnd even though things may seem scary, try to think of it as an exciting time. Now is the time to start making your life what you want it to be. Nobody else has to have a say in that, certainly not as much as you do. Relish that and cherish the journey ahead. Your newfound independence is going to be a wild ride with some benefits you never would have even thought of, and some challenges you never would have thought of either. It\u2019s an exciting time, now put your nose to the grind and grab your own destiny by the balls. I believe in you.",

            "comment": "You have 10k and an associates degree, that's a HUGE step forward, especially for 17.  Find a friend to take you to get a license, get a car, a job and find an apartment and a roommate.  The license is definitely first, car/job/apartment should all come together as they do.  You should be able to get a car for $1000, it'll be a beater but that's fine.  You'll need it to get to and from work, and possibly live in for a bit.  If your situation is as dire as you make it out to be, this should be perfectly acceptable.\n\nOther things of note, file with social security to get a new card, you probably need one and it'll cut your parents off at the source.  They'll have a number that is totally invalid.  This will also allow you to open your own bank accounts that they will have a huge amount of difficulty social engineering.  Also, open your own bank account at a bank they have no affiliation with whatsoever.  This will save a huge amount of headaches too.  But honestly, if you've got a degree, car, job, apartment and bank account by the time you're 19...you don't understand how massively far ahead you are in life.  At that point, use your free time to pick up a trade, I hear welding is in desperate need of welders.  Could retire by 30 and be dead by 40 (welders typically don't live very long).",

                    "comment": "It is nigh impossible to be issued a *new* social security number. Even in cases of frequent, documented identity theft. A replacement card is easy to get, which unfortunately will have the same number. \n\n1. Save as much money as possible in a secret account at a bank where they have no accounts and are not connected to your account. You want to minimize your parents ability to social engineer their way to your money. \n2. Gather whatever documents you can as discreetly as you can. Medical records, birth certificate, social security card, associates degree &amp; transcript, GED. If you cannot secure your documents discreetly, contact the police (and CPS if the police are not helpful) for an escort when you move out to help you secure your documents. If you cannot get these documents and the police aren't helpful, you can request replacements for all documentation. It'll take a while and you generally need your social security card prior to starting a job. Really just pick an option. \n3. Check your credit for free to make sure they haven't abused your credit too. \n4. Open a PO Box or have you mail delivered to a secret, trusted location. You don't want things like bank statements and record requests delivered to your parents house. \n5. As soon as you are 18, as soon as you move out or ASAP, *freeze* your credit *at all three credit agencies*. No one can open an account under your name and social security number without having the pin. \n6. You can certainly try to become legally emancipated from your parents. It's difficult to do but beneficial. \n\nOP, there are a lot of support subreddits out there for people raised by abusive parents. \n\nSome general tips: \n\n\\- Never use real information for security questions that your parents could guess. For instance, \"What is your mother's maiden name?\" make your answer something like \"pineapple\", NOT your mother's maiden name. \n\n\\- Look out for abusive people and situations. As a sheltered and abused child, you're a prime target. Make friends and run scenarios by multiple friends (who don't know each other) or the internet. Ask often if something is appropriate. \n\n\\- You don't need to stay in a high cost of living area. $10,000 is a great seed money in some states and barely anything in many places in California, unfortunately. Move to where you have a support system. Your estranged siblings is a start. \n\n\\- It's great you have an associate's degree. It means you don't have to rely on your GED, which is not popular with employers. Experiment with your resume, generally once people have a post-secondary degree they stop mentioning their high school diploma. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Those are REALLY tough to get without mom &amp; dad's involvement.  \n\nOn your 18th birthday you'll need food and shelter, both of which aren't going to happen without charity or gainful employment.  You'll need someone's couch to crash on for say... 3 months until you can get a stable job and some savings up and running.  \n\nThat 10k will help, but try not to use it because there's going to be some failures in the launch process and that cash will help you un-fuck one of them. \n\nHave you considered a total package solution like joining the military? They have a long history of being an escape hatch for folks in your situation.  It gives you food, shelter, medical care, and an eventual college education should you so choose.  \n\nMom and Dad can try to come after you there, but will be defeated by the staggering beauracracy before them, if not the physical security.  At the very least it will give you some career skills and time to sort life out.  \n\nIt sounds like the next 4-5 years of your life are going to get messy anyway and won't involve college or career skills.  At least this pulls the plug cold turkey from Mom &amp; Dad in a productive way.   \n\nAs a bonus, you can start the process nowish and have them pick you up on your birthday.  Mom and Dad can't say no to federal orders.  ",

If it is it means your parents could drain your account with you having little to no recourse. Based on what you've described that sounds like something they might do given the chance. If your account is joint, open a new one with a different bank.",

Once you have that it's easy to get other documents. Most towns have a social security office, and you can walk right in and request a copy. They usually arrive in the mail within 2 weeks.\n\nIf you live in an area with a good bus system, don't worry about a car yet. A monthly bus pass is extremely cheap. You just have to learn the routes, and plan ahead. \n\nAny chance your parents will stop you from taking your things? See if your brother will hold onto some stuff for you. You can always slip out an item or two when you go to work.\n\nIs there a youth hostile in your area? These are cheaper than a hotel (also less private, so dont take anything of value) and can give you time to find an affordable place to rent without getting tied up in leases, or contracts, while you look.",

            "comment": "I will do my best to compile the list, in the order I'd suggest:\n\nIMMEDIATELY\n\nGet a UPS box with an address that can receive pretty much all types of mail. (DO NOT get a PO address, they are too restrictive)\n\nSet up a safe deposit box, as secure as you can reasonably afford. Be sure to notify the entity that keeps your safety deposit box that under no circumstances are they to allow your family to access the box.\n\nGet a new phone for yourself, have it addressed to the above address. Do not share that number with ANYONE, and only use that phone number for relatively important services like banks or utilities that you can't live without. Use Google voice or a similar service to create a new phone number that wraps through your actual number. Use this phone number to contact friends and apply to jobs. Do not share that this is not your type phone number, and never share either number with ANYONE in your family until you believe you are out of this situation and the list is cleared.\n\nGet two new email addresses. Both need to be professional and secure. Get them set up with TFA, either with an authenticator app or better with something like a yubikey for hightened security. Sync the emails with two yubikeys, keeping one on your person and one in the security deposit box. Preferably go with a yubikey/substitute that works easily with both phones and computers.\n\nGet a password manager. As soon as possible, change all of the accounts you use to strong, randomized, and unique passwords generated by the app. Target 30 characters or more whenever allowed. Do not share access to this password manager, EVER.\n\nHave any future bills or accounts set up to email you instead of mail you whenever possible, and have it sent to your secure address. This applies going forward to ALL of your bills. Never share the physical address with anyone, and only ever share your public facing email as needed, never your private one.\n\nGet a new bank account and a new credit card set up, in that order. You will want the first to be created and ready before you start the second. Use the credit card sparingly - only once or twice a month is ideal.\n\nPrep your resume, and (using your new phone number - the public facing one, not the true phone number - and new address) apply for new jobs AWAY from family and in an area you are comfortable uprooting to and locking in for a bit. Be prepared for some good cross-country type jobs if you have to, but default to any job that is less public facing and has some assurance of stability.\n\nThe idea is to have a job lined up right around the time you turn 18. You want to be able to seek housing with a job lined up at the same time you get access to all of the rights turning 18 affords you.\n\n\n\nOnce you get the job, the harder stuff starts:\n\nGet a Craigslist roommate near the job ASAP. Get a new UPS mailbox near your new residence but far enough away to be discreet. Have the UPS forward from your old box to the new box if possible, and change all of your services to use the new address.\n\nTransfer all of your funds to the new accounts (banks, credit cards, and anywhere else you stored funds) that your family might have had access to. Close all of your old accounts. Get your name off of any shared utilities, and transfer custody of those accounts to whoever is your family needs to monitor them going forward. Be very careful doing this, as you will need to do all of the following steps soon after.\n\nJust prior to or potentially ON your 18th birthday:\n\nGet a free consultation with a reputable lawyer. They should be able to advise you on your rights and direct you in basic ways on things you may have missed. Keep their info in your phone, and if possible memorize their emergency contact details.\n\nYou will need to collect your documents. Go to the local police in advance, and get their help on this. They should have experience with situations like this. They may or may not be able to do anything for you until after your 18, so be prepared to have to wait until your birthday. Have them with you when you ask for your documents. DO NOT leave without the docs, as your parents can do terrible damage with them.\n\nBased on how the document extract goes, be prepared to have the lawyer do some good old-fashioned lawyering to determine them to keep distance.\n\nTake only the items you must have for sanity, health, and security, and get out of there. Take a ride share/plane/trane with your stuff to the new Craigslist roommate place. Incorporating more than just any one of thone is preferable, as it will help maintain your privacy and security to get away.\n\nDO NOT expect the things left behind to be safe, and whatever you do don't be goaded into going back for them. Take what is needed and replace what is replaceable later.\n\nIf it is needed, you can get a car once you are moved in and established at your new job. Don't feel that a car is needed unless it helps maintain your employment. Debt can be tricky and may end up being a reason you have to get back in contact with your family, so be really careful on this. Same goes for the credit card. You'll really need to build up clean and separate credit history from your family, but it can be a horrible trap if you let it.\n \n\n\nIf I missed something, I will try to come back and fix it (and note that it was added).\n\nPlease stay safe, and know that it gets better. You can do it!",

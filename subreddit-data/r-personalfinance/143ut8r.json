No debt either. \n\n[(Reference image for below)](https://imgur.com/a/QbH55SL)\n\n-Emergency fund = the money I have sitting in my 4% HYSA (about 25k)\n\n-401k with 5% company match, but currently contributing much past that as I plan on maxing this (into a 2065 target date fund) \n\n-Maxed my Roth IRA, currently investing in VTSAX (80%) &amp; VTIAX (20%).\n\n(Also no HSA as I\u2019m using my parents plan right now)\n\nMy plan as of right now is to keep $10k in the HYSA, but put the rest of it in VOO. Which would be $15k + what I make other than the money I set aside for myself. \n\nThoughts?",

Not saying one is better than the other, but then why did you choose VTSAX for the IRA and not VFIAX? \n  \nI also took advantage of free food/rent with my parents after college. I didn\u2019t put as much into retirement as you (I did ~9%), but that\u2019s because I wanted cash to use for a downpayment on a property (I did 20% down, plus ~$8k in closing costs and whatnot).",

That is how much would put me at $19500 or whatever the number is. \n\nVOO for the brokerage because it has a 0.03% expense ratio and no minimum amount. VFIAX has a 0.04% expense ratio and a minimum of $3000. Otherwise they are the same afaik. Not sure about VTSAK tho",

If so, renting or straight into an attempt to be a homeowner? If the latter, you may want to put a hold on reallocation of funds into the brokerage as you get your down payment ready.",

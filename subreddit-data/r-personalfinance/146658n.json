    "postText": "Hello, a bit of background on me. I am 26, in a commission based job and make 100,000 a year but it can vary based on what is happening in the world. Take home is roughly 55% of that after taxes,15% 401k, roth IRA, and benefits are taken out.\n\nDuring the pandemic I paid off my car loan on my 2013 BRZ. The car had 12k miles when I bought it a few years back for 15k including a warranty and now has around 42k on the dash.\n\nI ended up buying a new 22 WRX without trading my other car.  (2.9% APR) Total that car is costing me 750 ish a month including insurance and I just cannot justify that in my mind especially with insurance getting more expensive every time they can make a change to it.  I got it so I would have back seats for my dog and AWD rather than RWD. I do not need two cars and realize my mistakes now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhere I am at - I can get 16k for the BRZ if I sell it, or I can make about a grand on the WRX selling it. I am thinking selling the WRX is a better decision long term because it frees me from a car loan, and my insurance would only be 80 or so a month for just the BRZ.  Or would it be better to pocket the 16k, pay off any college debt, have a larger emergency fund, and a newer car with a 10 year warranty?\n\nWhat are your opinions?",

If I were you I\u2019d probably sell the BRZ and turn around and dump that money into the principal on the WRX just because it\u2019s more practical overall",

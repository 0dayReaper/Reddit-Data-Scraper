    "postText": "Hey all,\n\nLooking for some advice because my head has been spinning. I'm late 20's and due to my crappy luck or poor genes had a reinjury of my hip. I've gotten MRI's, xrays, surgeon visits and will be starting physical therapy.\n\nOne major wrench is that my wife now doesn't like her job and is looking for new employment. Unfortunately, I'm on her insurance so this is setting off alarm bells in my head. From my understanding my deductibles (which I'm close to hitting) would reset and I don't even know if all of the places I've started going to would accept this new insurance.\n\nShe'd be receiving a 30-40% increase in pay and we would be under new insurance, but this timing seems horrible. I was told without taking measures to address my hip I would likely have a replacement in my 30s. I'm looking for advice/things to consider because I'm admittedly stressed and not thinking rationally.\n\nTLDR; Is it too risky to change insurance while in the process of frequent recommended medical treatment?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdited: Formatting",

She should take the job. \n\nNew insurance should cover your medically necessary treatments and even if the deductible resets, the financial side will be more than covered by her increase in pay. Taking a significant raise will be great long term as it is a multi year thing , hopefully increases retirement contributions as well, and improves career trajectory. Your deductible resets yearly.\n\nIf you are concerned, sit down with your spouse and tell her you are understandably worried about treatment continuity and ask to find out more - this could be done through the new employer's HR or by just calling the new insurance company. Best of luck! And congrats to your spouse on the job offer!\n\nETA: Edited for typos.",

I've been the insurance carrier in the couple for many, many years, and both of us needed medical treatments - it's a major consideration for job searches. What I found out over the years is that the brain tends to come up with the worst case scenario (\"I will lose access to treatment and my condition will get worse and I will need even worse treatments,\" and so on and so forth). What happens in reality is that when one gets a higher paying job, one's insurance coverage usually either improves or stays at the same level. So you might lose the deductible since it resets, but you gain a huge salary increase which will be much higher than the deductible, and in a year the deductible resets anyway. It's a major win in a medium-long term even if in the short term there's the hassle of changing insurance carriers, deductible resetting, etc.\n\nBest of luck!",

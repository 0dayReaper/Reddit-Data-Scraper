    "postText": "In the US, is there a way one with a regular taxable brokerage account can gift stocks to their family without either a.) the owner paying capital gains to liquidate and b.) the giftee having to pay the step up in gains if they sell them?\n\nI assume no matter what the giftee will have to pay capital gains when selling unless they obtain the stock through inheritance. But if the owner of the stock wants to gift the stocks while still living, is there any way to avoid paying tax on that? Would a trust be an option? Or do you have to liquidate assets to put them into a trust?",

AND potentially makes more of your donation income tax deductible.",

The current system does mean it\u2019s possible to be taxes twice, I think: the giver buys stock for $1 and it grows to $20 million. The giver pays taxes on about about $7 million given in excess of the lifetime exemption, and then the recipient sells and pays the capital gains on $19,999,999.\n\nYou can avoid paying gift taxes by keeping the total lifetime gift value under $12.92 million per person. For most families that\u2019s not a concern.",

Yeah, we're talking anywhere from 20-50k probably being gifted to a few individuals from one family member. Unfortunately if the family members who owns the stocks wants to gift them, they are devalued basically by 15% or 20% due to LT Cap Gains.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor the 0% cap gains income, does that just mean their income needs to be in that margin, or once they start selling off old stock that have LT gains, do those gaints then apply to the margin? Say they made 20k in work income, but sold stocks that have 50k in cap gains...does that mean 70k income for the LT bracket to now be 15% rate?",

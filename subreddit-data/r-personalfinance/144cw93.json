    "postText": "My 0% APR promo is expiring on a credit card and I am going to pay off the $3K balance entirely. I have the money to do it but I will need to dip into some of my savings to prep for rent the next month.\n\nI have a Robin Hood, Acorns and Crypto account all of which is around $3K in each. I was thinking of withdrawing a $200 out of each or taking most out of the RH since it is doing the worst of the 3 for me.\n\nIs it better to take a little out of each or take more out of the least preforming account? \nThanks for any advice!",

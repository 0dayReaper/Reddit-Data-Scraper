You can open your own if you are legally allowed to and contribute to it yourself but in either event your work won\u2019t be involved. Check to make sure you are eligible before contributing though.",

At least not pre-tax. \n\nHowever you could just choose to open your own HSA and contribute to it with after-tax funds, then claim an income tax deduction when you file your taxes.",

If it is, then the best option would likely be for her to make all the contributions through her paychecks. By contributing via payroll, she would avoid payroll taxes (7.65%, I believe). Income taxes would be avoided either way -- if done via payroll, then it reduces the amount of taxes withheld from your paycheck; if you make the contributions yourself, then you'll get those taxes back when you file at the end of the year. So, for income taxes, it doesn't matter, but payroll taxes are only avoided with payroll contributions.\n\n3. Regarding your employer: I don't believe they can make payroll contributions if they are not providing the HSA/HDHP insurance plan. Even if they can, it would be very unusual that they would.\n\nNote that HSA funds can always be used for yourself, your spouse, and your tax dependents' medical expenses. And for married couples with a family plan,they are  limited to the family contribution limit combined across any/all HSAs either of them owns. So, there is not much benefit to contributing to one spouse's HSA over the other. Go with the one that will provide the most benefit (avoiding payroll taxes and/or any fees associated with one HSA over the other).",

However, that is after taxes for me an I would not be able to write it off at the end of the year. I think I will just make my contribution and miss the payroll tax, but get the income tax credit\n\nSpeaking to your last paragraph, my company is less than 10 people. So insurance is not provided through my company. Luckily, I do get a health insurance stipend from them. This just means my only way of contributing to an HSA is through my wife's.",

As noted, you will still need to coordinate with her to ensure that, together, you don't exceed the family contribution limit.",

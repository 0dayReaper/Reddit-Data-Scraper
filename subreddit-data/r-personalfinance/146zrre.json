    "postText": "I made an (impulsive) move for high paying position in an expensive city w/ 750 FICO, zero debt, perfect payment history, etc. Laid off within 3 months of move right before the holidays, went through my savings, &amp; then used my credit cards to just pay the bills including rent to survive going from 0 to \\~$23,000 in CC debt. Though I managed to never miss a payment, FICO dropped to 630 for high CC utilization, interest rates are between 28-30% on my 2 main CC (Apple &amp; Venture), found a another position that pays well (not quite as high as the original that brought me here but still covers everything plus some extra).\n\n I'm paying close to $1000/month in CC bills that are primarily interest, putting $1200 back into emergency fund (which was at zero -  I need to have cash reserve) each month, got rid of my car in when my lease was up Feb (live in a walking city), and will most likely be doing a major cost of living reduction (potential move back to my home city or cheaper apt) within the next 6 months. I feel so exposed not having an emergency fund nor a familial safety net, so that is my main priority. I am not a spender on CC - no dinners out, no real fun, I hate buying things (when I do, I buy  high quality items that and last forever vs. quantity only on an as needed basis). A consolidation loan would stop the interest, wipe the slate on my CC and allow me to save closer to $2K a month vs. 1K for emergencies. I don't see a 0% CC balance transfer as an option to take care of this based on my FICO. \n\nMy finances were a disaster in my 20's when I just didn't get it (spoiled kid and then completely cut off for being a clueless idiot about money) with ruined credit pretty much out of the gate in college. It took time to get the high limit CC's that I have now, but at the cost of high interest rates. I never kept balances, so it didn't bother me and was happy that I had got to a point where I had these CC for emergencies. I would have been truly fucked without them so I am grateful for that. \n\nI could really use some solid advice, recommendations of consolidation programs or resources that aren't a complete scam. The good news is that I am single, 30's and don't have anyone to worry about, but myself. I am also looking for a weekend part time job just to slay this debt faster and keep building the emergency fund. I don't know what it takes to qualify for this sort of relief, but want to really know what I am doing and who to approach before taking the gamble. Your advice is appreciated.  Thank you!",

Putting $2200/ month will have you out of debt in less than a year.   If you want to do it faster, get a second job",

Having the credit cards were a blessing, but there a things that are cash only: health insurance, security deposits on potential cheaper apartments, rent in most places (I lucked out that my building accepted them), etc. Don't you think it would be better to have a bigger emergency fund to avoid having to use CC's in the future for emergenices ? I don't have a close relationship with my family and it's shocking to see how quickly one can go from making a great salary to potentially being homeless if there aren't those safety nets in place of a partner/spouse or a family who can take you in during tough times.",

Right now though you keep a small emergency fund to keep you from using credit cards.  Once cc are paid off you start putting the money back into your emergency fund.   \n\n\nI follow Dave Ramsey and he calls for a $1k EF, although I think I would be too stressed out with that level.  My comfort level would be about 4 K.   It\u2019s about paying cash for unexpected expenses instead of using your cc.  ( much do you currently have the EF?",

The job market where I am is shaky and now in a new job w/ little seniority, coming off a layoff that caused this situation, I am terrified of having less than 20K min in savings. I don't get the logic of 1K in EF. Wouldn't that start the cycle of charging cards back up? To be fair, I don't/didn't know much about Dave Ramsey before lurking on this thread. He seems to be held in high esteem here. I will definitely be looking more into his thoughts and practices to get an idea of his big picture.",

You\u2019d at least get to reduce some interest payments for a while (saving you money in the long run), and you\u2019d just end up in the same place you are now. \n\nIMO, once you get to having an emergency fund of about a month, shift towards paying down the CC debt before you start worrying about loading up the emergency fund.",

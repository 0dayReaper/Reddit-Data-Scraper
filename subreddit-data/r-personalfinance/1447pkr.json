I\u2019ve read alote of articles recently about these great rates available but every time I login I see one or two treasuries available for purchase. Do they not list all treasuries available? Does the govt treasury site show more options. I just get the feeling I\u2019m missing something?",

These are the secondary market offerings that Vanguard has access to. Each duration range has about 3-15 securities in them.\n\nIf you buy from TreasuryDirect, you would buy from the next auction, i.e. primary market offering.",

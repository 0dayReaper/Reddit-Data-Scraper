    "postText": "It has been quite a year. I\u2019m disappointed that we have gotten into the position we are in. Through job loss, depression, and unemployment for my husband, we finally sat down and looked at our finances. I feel overwhelmed and stuck- We used to be in a great position, with no debt but here we are. \n\nI know we have to start somewhere. Honestly I have never had debt I couldn\u2019t pay so the thought of consolidating sounds like a good idea. I am hopeful with direction and budgeting we can target a plan. \n\nIncome- Husband is currently back as Independent contractor clerking for $25/hour. He will take the bar exam in July and if all goes well, secure an attorney position in September. \n\nI am 100% commission in sales. Variability but summer tends to be a good time but this isn\u2019t a normal market to be in mortgages. \n\nINCOME:\n-May = $3520 (~$2112 after tax)\n-June = $22,838 (~$13702.80 after tax)\n-July = $9,857 currently, could increase (~$5914.20 after tax)\n-July 1st = ~$3500 Husband Income\n-August 1st = ~$1700 Husband Income (reduced hours for studying). \n\nFamily- 4.5 year old, 2 year old both in full time childcare. Baby #3 due in September. No paid maternity leave, my income should continue. I will stay home through the end of 2023. 2 dogs.\n\nCurrent Accounts:\nChecking Account = $5,763.38\nSavings Account = $500.01\n401k Account = ~$120,000\n\nLiabilities:\nHVAC - $4,556.45 Balance. 0% interest if paid by 11/2023. Currently paying $550/month. \n\nMortgage- $2,458.20 PITI 5.875% ARM 30 Year (~$315k Loan, ~$85,000 equity)\n\nBOA Credit Card- $32,809 Balance ($32,000 Limit). 19.74% Interest, Minimum Payment of $680.\n\nChase Credit Card- $8,832.07 Balance ($18,000 Limit) 27.99% Interest. Minimum Payment of $275.\n\nObviously I am paralyzed by the amount of debt against what we have and have coming in. Yes we anticipate a large income boost for my husband but I want to be in the best position before baby arrives. Our lack of emergency fund worries me. \n\nWe have cancelled subscriptions, have a budget through YNAB, and are working on selling items for extra income. \n\nIs there an option that is worth exploring- Debt consolidation? Putting the cards away and just doing the minimum balance to save for an EF? Cash out refinance to pay off the debt and take a higher mortgage rate over the interest? We are probably in this home for only &lt;3 more years.\n\nThank you for your advice. I know this is the beginning and look forward to sharing our success story.",

I wouldn\u2019t normally recommend this, but have you considered a withdrawal from your 401k or a loan from your 401k. This could be a little costly (a withdrawal at lear would have a 10% penalty)  but you\u2019re paying almost 20%-30% interest. Just a thought. If this doesn\u2019t sound like a good plan then you need to hang on until your husband is earning more, and then spend NOTHING extra to celebrate until all of your debts are cleared. Best of luck!",

Probably, but it doesn\u2019t solve the problem.\n\nIt\u2019s not fun but budget and reduce your expenses until they are less than your income and use the excess to pay down the debt.",

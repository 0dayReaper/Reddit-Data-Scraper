    "postText": "We were both blindsided by today. We're both pretty young, early on in our careers, he had only been there a year and was performing. It was a huge shock. We don't practice every best habit of the sub but we're grateful we picked up doing your best to live off one income.\n\nWe just bought our house in August and insisted on going through the pre-approval process off my income alone.  Our lights will stay on because our bills are effectively scaled to one income as well. We held off on car payments and continued to drive our beaters because the numbers for new used cars didn't make sense with one income.\n\nMy only regret is not building up our emergency fund more (one month saved but we should've had at least three), so if you're reading this, definitely do that.\n\nAnyways, thanks to the sub for the constant advice on living below your means and always being prepared. I came to thank you all, not lecture. And encourage people who are following this thought process and are using a second income for the \"extra stuff\" - you're doing great. Today sucked but it could've been so much worse.\n\nWe're counting our blessings and the job search begins tomorrow.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for the encouragement and well-wishes. This obviously isn't the only thing going on in our lives, so the messages to keep going were greatly appreciated. \n\nFor those of you who are in HCOL areas or other situations where living off one income isn't possible, I totally understand - the intent of this post wasn't to shame anyone into anything. We live in a MCOL city in the South and are in the tech sector so it was doable for us. We're also not beacons of perfection of this sub and are still working on breaking bad financial habits every day. \n\nFor those of you who took this as a self pat-on-the-back post, I can see that. The intent really was to see the silver lining of things and encourage others who are perhaps considering this type of budgeting method. But I understand how fast this sub gets into circle-jerking and self-congratulating and didn't mean to purpose this thread for that. Just hoping to reduce the amount of \"We're in deep shit from one event that could've had a much lower impact\" posts by showing anything can happen at any time and that even then, we weren't as prepared as we should've been.",

They asked how much my partner makes and suggested they could offer us more than double our pre-approval amount (we also single-income'd it) if we were both willing to go in. My partner earns about 15k less. We're so glad we declined. \n\nI mean, loan officers aren't your personal accountants and aren't here to make sure you're living within your means, but damn.",

I believe they would have given me about 50% more if I had asked.  In addition, my salary is about 60% of my wife's, so I have the smaller the income out of the two of us.  If both of us combined to apply for the mortgage, the \"full amount\" would probably be 3x (or more) of the amount we actually took. There's no way we could afford that.  Even the amount we took feels like a lot.  Maybe only if we didn't have kids.",

So basically my living expenses are half of my take home pay. That being said if my income was cut in half I would definitely be miserable with no discretionary income and not be able to save a dime but still, I think I got lucky in finding my place and being able to afford it. The amount I was approved for would have left me feeling so anxious it wouldn't have been worth it, even though I do wish I had a larger place...",

No mortgage.\n\nA few years later the market crashed and he was in his mid-50s and lost his job. No else was hiring him and he got forced into retirement. He reminded me that if he'd bought one of those multi-million dollar homes he'd have been spread too thin and for sure had to sell while underwater.\n\nThat sort of guided my home purchase last year. My down payment was like 50%. I have no idea if that's a great idea, but I felt the same pressure from bankers.",

When you look at \"no-risk investments\" we tend to look at US treasuries (or German or whatever). The thing is, even when we consider these investments very safe, they still are not completly without risk. Paying of your mortgage is 100% risk free, every payment you make reduces your interest. There's no investment you can make that is safer than paying of the mortgage. Is it the best investment? Debatable, but not being leveraged by a bank is in my opinion one of the greatest financial indepentdent stations you can arrive at.",

Though much lower than you might expect. In your scenario, owning the property and having housing prices drop, does nothing to your residual income. A crash in the stock/bond market would. If you would move during a housing crash and all prices have dropped relative to each other there's no problem selling  the house and buying another one (which would also have droppen relative in price). The other value is owning property versus renting or making interest payments is that it contributes to your spending or saving money. And owning the property without a loan makes you less prone to financial risks as a whole since there's less leverage in your situation.",

Under this assumption the only difference is that after paying off the loan you no longer pay interest, which is the only difference in either scenario. Not paying interest on the mortgage has become the ROI of your \"investment\" in paying for the mortgage. English is not my first language, so perhaps my first post didn't convey my thought well enough.",

That being said, I like to ask the Car salesman question of my borrowers, \"what kind of payment do you want to be at?\" What the government says you can afford for a VA loan is higher than actuality because it takes into account your gross income and not net income. Most people get into trouble this way. At best, take your net income (after taxes and medical, retirement etc etc) and divide by 2 and that should be a good jumping off point for how much loan amount you can get with that payment (taking into account principal, interest, taxes, and insurance, and HOA dues).\n\nEdit: net monthly income.",

It's certainly not their fault if your circumstances unexpectedly change a year into the mortgage and now you're making much less money than when you signed.\n\nJust because their guideline doesn't precisely match up with the buyer's personal financial plan doesn't mean they're trying to take advantage of the buyer or maliciously mislead them.  Do they want to get you into a bigger mortgage?  Sure, but they also want you to *pay it back*.  But whether or not you might get laid off in a year or have six kids is certainly not something *they're* going to be hedging against when they tell you how much of a mortgage you qualify for.  That's 100% the buyer's responsibility to know their own life and financial plans and make intelligent financial choices aligned with their own tolerance for risk.

There is probably some bump higher if you are under an income threshold, but for anybody with good or great credit and that can afford a loan based on gross income ratio, no reason they shouldn't be getting the best bank rate from the lender. Or the savvy buyer will walk their business to another lender. \n\nHaving a super high income to loan value on the other hand doesn't mean one is going to get a good interest rate, if their credit is shit. \n\nThat all said, there isn't a real reason to show more or less income if you're going to qualify on the income you do show. If you choose to try to make it work based on one income, and it does, it doesn't matter how much you have in reserve. If it doesn't, maybe you stick to your guns and say \"we can't afford this\" or maybe you say, \"well, we can afford this, we just weren't planning on using all of our income\". But neither scenario should affect the rate the bank is giving you, in my own experience. \n\nI am not a mortgage lender, but I did shop for mortgages recently on a second home and I stayed in a holiday inn express once, too.",

They're also likely way more knowledgeable than you are in this particular field.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYou look at a couple dozen $200k houses, and the real estate agent subtly tosses in one at $250k-300k. It just happens to have all of things you said you wanted with little to no compromises. Oh she didn't realize it was that far out of your budget! You might as well look now that you've driven all the way out here. You don't have to buy after all! You walk around and love it, because its 25-50% nicer than everything else you've looked at. Now that you're pre-approved it's that much easier to let your emotions convince you that it is a good decision.",

I know they get their check as a percentage of your purchase but happiness of the transaction and referrals do matter too for their career. I\u2019m using my realtor almost exclusively because she works aggressively for your personal interest. I love a house? She doesn\u2019t hesitate to point out a bunch of expensive issues with it to me so we know what we may need to budget to fix, and also what we should negotiate the price for. \n\nMaybe that\u2019s normal for a realtor, this is my first ever home purchase.

So we have to outsource to off site contractors for like 50% of our work. Which has its own problems, but my point is I\u2019ve never felt more secure in my position. A year ago I lost my job at a failing startup, applied here and had interviews starting like the next day. Basically \u201cwhen can you start, sign here..\u201d",

Your state/county should have a whole website for it (apply to food stamps and utility assistance while you\u2019re at it, some states bunch the applications for each into one big one) literally the worst that can happen is you get denied with no penalty to you. The best is you get free government assistance that is your RIGHT to utilize and you may even qualify for more help than you thought :) I\u2019m not sure how it affects end of year taxes though so I\u2019d be sure to keep any and all documentation if you do receive assistance.

    "postText": "EDIT: Thank you all for clarifying this. I didn't understand and have now been informed. I'd like to leave this up in case anyone else has this misconception/confusion\n\nMy employer offers what is called a 6-3 match, meaning for every $1 contributed up to 6% of pay, they will contribute $0.50.\n\nSo there is no full 100% match, only 50%.\n\nI am following the financial steps provided on this sub. Regarding the 401k, how much should I contribute if I still have debt to pay off, if at all?\n\nI have no credit card debt, one personal loan used for consolidation at 12.18% interest and a car loan at 5.79%.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m 25 years old and earlier this week my mom asked if I could take out a $6000 personal loan in my name that would be given to her to help her out with her bills as she\u2019s fallen very much behind. She even said she might lose her house from not being able to pay her bills.\n\nTruthfully, I don\u2019t feel comfortable. I\u2019ve racked up around 7K in credit card debt due to my dumb, younger self and now I\u2019ve been trying to slowly pay it off. My credit score is even 640. On top of that, I have about $36K in student loans that I have to start making payments on soon. \n\nI guess I\u2019m worried about the \u201cwhat if\u201d. What if I take out this loan and sure, she starts paying it back monthly but then we enter a time where she can\u2019t and it falls on me? I seriously can\u2019t afford another bill like that right now. Also, the whole general idea that, if a bank won\u2019t trust her and approve her for her own loan, doesn\u2019t that mean I shouldn\u2019t trust her either? Doesn\u2019t this just add to the problem by giving her another bill once she\u2019s caught up of her past bills? I\u2019m also worried about how it\u2019ll affect my credit score that I\u2019m trying so hard to bring back up by paying back the credit card debt I\u2019ve accumulated. But the whole dilemma is, she\u2019s my mom and needs help and I could possibly help her in this. \n\nI think I already know I should stick to my boundary and say no, but I guess I just need some advice/reiteration of how this clearly isn\u2019t a good idea? I\u2019m torn.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nUPDATE \n\nThank you all for each and every one of your comments. You have no idea how much this helped me in feeling more secure in my decision to tell my mom that I am unable to do this for her. I actually went ahead and sent her a text about this now since that\u2019s all I\u2019m mentally able to do. There is so much more to this situation which is why it makes it so complicated and had me feel so torn, but I\u2019m sticking to creating this boundary with her for the sake of myself. Thank you all once again. I appreciate it so much.",

I think the reason why I needed confirmation is because of the massive guilt that I will have, plus the manipulation I will receive from her if I don\u2019t do this loan. Logistically, I know what to do- which is to not do it. Emotionally, it\u2019s extremely difficult to say no since I\u2019ve been conditioned to give in to doing things for her (even when I don\u2019t want to) because of how bad she makes me feel afterwards. Seeing just your comment, and all the others, is helping me stand my ground. Thank you.",

Or just take from the equity itself.\nOr take out her own personal loan, or take out a loan against a vehicle...\n.\nShe should not be asking you for this, and should definitely not being guilt tripping you about it.\n.\nIf you have 36k of student debt, and 7K credit card debt, you may not be able to get another 6K loan.\n.\nIf you really feel like you must consider it, find out what a lone like that would cost you, and just plan to pay it in your budget. Do not expect her to pay you back at all. Because it can damage your relationship if you expect her to pay it back.",

I plan on asking her if she considered that option, but most likely she will try to push the initial request of me taking out that personal loan for her. \n\nEssentially, I planned on paying off the majority of my credit card debt once I received my yearly bonus from my job- and then strictly engraving it in my head to not rack up this much credit debt. However, even with that paid off, once my student loans start, that money that has been going towards my credit card payments would just be going towards my student loan payments\u2026 leaving me in the same financial position. So pretty much, yeah. I don\u2019t have extra money to even consider possibly paying off the payment to this personal loan if I took it out. Sorry for the extra info, but\u2026. yeah. I need to stick to my gut and not do this for her.",

Loans have a habit of straining or ruining relationships, even really close ones.

Limit contact if necessary. If she pesters or tries to guilt trip you then let her know that not only can you not do the loan, but you also can't bare to listen to her guilt trip so that has to stop. If it doesn't then you avoid contact with her (decline to go over to visit, don't answer phone calls and texts). The limited contact will start to teach her that you're serious and maybe she'll learn to accept those boundaries. If she never does, then at least avoiding contact will help resolve the stress. It's a situation that sucks, but it's one that your mom created all by herself by being the person she is. None of it is your fault.",

For this to even be a consideration there needs to be a firm plan in place on how she expects to not only payback the loan but what she is changing regarding her budget to afford her lifestyle... until then she is just buying time before doing the same thing all over again",

The most affordable loan is a HELOC since it's secured by the house. \n\n2. So if she's not mortgaged to the hilt, she should take a HELOC, full stop. Your unsecured loan will have a higher interest rate and that's wasting your/her money. \n\n3. If she **is** mortgaged to the hilt, then she can't take out more HELOC and it's why she's knocking on your door now... she's out of other options. \n\n4. The FACT that she's out of other options means that there's no fucking way she'll ever, ever pay you back. This isn't a loan, it's a gift. She's just lying (either to your, or to both you and herself). \n\n5. Even if you did give her the money, $6K isn't that much in the grand scheme of things. If she's tapped out her HELOC and has other debt, she's going to lose the house anyway. \n\nSo in no world is this action sensible for your family as a whole, much less you.",

Depending on where you live, because she is living in the house, she will have greater control over deadbeats/non payers and can evict people a lot easier than being a straight up land lord.\n\nMy parents came from Poland in the 60's and they bought a house in the city.

If you did, it would be a predatory payday loan and NEVER get those.\n\nTell her no, which is a complete sentence. If she asks, just say, my answer is no, it's final and non-negotiable. Then hang up or leave if you need.\n\nFocus on paying your CC debt off first as it likely has the highest interest. Create a budget for you, so when student loan payments are mandatory to pay again, you won't be caught off guard so much.

I know the compulsion to help mom may be strong, and it may be the morally right thing to do, but you are risking tanking your score and being responsible for even more debt. She will not be able to pay you back otherwise she would be eligible for a loan. Never take a loan out for anyone else, especially when you already have debt.",

Evict them.  If they are racking up debt in other peoples name, file a police report.  \n\nOn a different note, remember that debt on ever makes sense to cover a high cost, low frequency event.  Think buying a house -- its a huge expense, but only happens rarely, so you spread the payments across years via debt.  Debt pretty much never makes sense to cover regular, on going expenses, as the core problem of running a regular deficit cannot be fixed by debt. Unless your more have a concrete plan to cut expenses or increase her income, there is a 0% chance you will get paid back.",

    "postText": "I am saving for a house down payment and  am curious what options would be best for my situation. As of right now I\u2019m throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. \n\nI have about 40% of my savings in I-Bonds that have reached the 1 year threshold on 5/31/23. And contemplating pulling it out in September to avoid the 3 month penalty hitting the 6.48% rate. \n\nI have another 10% in a HYSA lumped in with my emergency savings. Which is currently at 4% APY. \n\n25% in a 6 month T-bill that matures in July. And 25% sitting in my Vanguard settlement fund VMFXX which has a 30 day yield at 5% but has an expense ratio. \n\nMy original home purchase timeframe was this summer to this fall, but I\u2019m not feeling it right now and am delaying until summer of 2024 to Fall of 2025.\n\nI can keep saving in multiple options but I recently noticed Vanguard has a section of ETFs they suggest for down payment savings. And I was curious if anyone thinks they are an appropriate option for a 12-24 month savings window? BSV, VGSH, or VTIP?\n\nTLDR: Saving for a house decided to put off the purchase for a year or two. Trying to decide where to park my down payment savings.",

Although the bond funds like BSV have a much, much higher risk of losing principal than do money market funds like VMFXX.",

If you're that far out from buying a house, you could hedge against rate declines with longer-term CD's/treasuries (but stick with terms that will mature before you plan on purchasing).",

    "postText": "Hello, I just got a new job and am looking at purchasing a home. I made a budget that I think is okay? But I\u2019m worried about missing expenses that a non homeowner or someone who isn\u2019t used to living in their own would miss. Here\u2019s what I have:\n\nFood: 300\t\nGas: 150\t\nToiletries: 50\t\nCar Payment: 306\t\nCar Insurance: 155\t\nMortgage: 2200\t\nUtilities: 300\t\nPhone Bill: 79\t\nYard maintenance: 60\t\nCrunchy Roll: 10\t\t\t\nPlay Money: 300\t\nRainy Day: 300\n\nThat totals to 4210.00.\n\nMy take home pay after taxes, insurance, and retirement is 2250 bi weekly so 4500 a month. This leaves me with about 300 after everything is said and done. Does Anyone have any suggestions? Is this cutting it too close? do you not see an expense that should be added to this list? I\u2019m worried about getting in a hole, and not being about to get out for a few years. Thank you in advance!\n\nEdit to add: I would be financing 280K from the institution and the 2200 mortgage includes principle/interest, taxes, HOA Fees, and insurance.",

What I'm actually getting at is that, by putting equity into a home, you are also putting that money into long-term savings/investment. That fact might let you deduct some from your other savings categories.\n\nFor instance, if part of your planned retirement expenses is leaving an inheritance for your children, you should be able to count the entire value of your home for that. On the other hand, if the inheritance isn't one of your concerns, then you could plan on trading the equity in your home in to cover part of your retirement expenses. Either way, you could then lower your retirement savings (this is assuming that you have control over those retirement payments).\n\nA similar case could possibly be made for your rainy day savings, although this depends on the nature of what you are saving for, and I urge caution here. For relatively small and common things like car repairs you will want to keep liquid assets on hand, but if you are also budgeting potentially catastrophic costs into your rainy day fund, you might consider if those catastrophes are unlikely enough that you are willing to commit to having to sell your home to pay for them if they do occur (alternatively, if you are not already saving for catastrophic costs, then putting equity in a home will give you the added benefit of that). You also have to take into account the housing market you're in when making this decision, as some homes are going to take a lot longer to get money out of than others.\n\nMy final word of advice--that you may have heard before--is to try out living with your proposed budget for a few weeks before committing to a mortgage (so take your proposed mortgage payment, minus what you're currently paying in rent, and put it into savings rather than consumption). This will give you at least some idea whether your budget is even sustainable in the short run.",

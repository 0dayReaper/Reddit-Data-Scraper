I now live with my parents. \n\nI used to have so much money saved up, almost $28k, but the pandemic drained my savings because I lost my high paying job, got depressed and started drinking a lot. I moved back home last year and saved up about $7k but I began partying and drinking a lot more and had to buy a new (used) car because mine died. That drained my savings.  \n\nIt\u2019s also hard cause I have student loans from my associates degree about $17k. \n\nI want to start saving but by the time I am on my feet again ill be about 30 and it makes me kinda want to end it all soon. \n\n\nI thought about finishing my degree because it is paid for by my company. This is the only positive thing in my life besides my parents allowing me to be rent free at home. \n\nI feel like I am at a disadvantage to my peers, I am so lost and don\u2019t know where to start. I am scared to touch my savings. \n\nI really am freaking out. I havent been this broke since age 22. I feel like i wasted my life and 20s partying.",

Still in your 20's, you have a long life to live and can rebound from missteps in life by making positive changes sooner than later.\n\n$22 an hour is nothing to scoff at, especially if you're not paying rent and possibly cable, gas and electric. Save what you can afford to rebuild the emergency fund and focus on the free education when time permits.",

You have used your 20s to learn some hard lessons, then you have all your 30s to develop find your path learn from the mistakes you made in your 20s.\n\nI am also in my 20s, 27. I think we people in our 20s think that 30 is old, but it isn't. You have a decade from 30-40 to find your career, find what makes you happy.\n\nYou have proven you can save money, twice now. You also know how and why you then lost those savings. Some people don't find that out until later in life when they don't have the time to learn or fix the mistake.",

Make a budget, a plan, and limit the partying!!! \n\nYou got this! Try to stay positive and don\u2019t feel bad for saying \u201cno\u201d at opportunities to spend your money. Look into Dave Ramsey or similar financial programs. It\u2019s very helpful to have a structure or plan in place, like \u2018the baby steps\u2019.",

I can assure you, your feelings of inadequacy are far more tied to your substance use, and your behavior that you clearly identify as something that must change, but doesnt. I know this from personal experience.\n\nThis is the personal finance subreddit so it wouldn't be my place to go in depth any further on the partying and drinking topic, but you are by no means behind in life. It is easy to look around and feel like by this point, you should be a tech bro making $170k a year in your downtown condo with your long term girlfriend and multiple investment properties and a sports car. But when you really start to look around at your peers, you will find that just having a roof over your head and a stable job is pretty alright.\n\nSo slow down. Focus on what matters. Change happens one step at a time. The hardest part is finding the patience to be happy with step 1.",

He was in his late 20's and moved back in after his long term girlfriend broke up with him and he was a broke grad student. That was 15 years ago. \n\nNow he has a job, a wife, two kids. Our parents died a few years ago,  and to be honest I envy the time he got to live at home with mom and dad as an adult. \n\nPlease be kind to yourself, and if you can, try to enjoy your parents while you have them. A lot of people need their 20's to make mistakes and figure out their priorities and quirks. On top of that,  the pandemic was hard on everyone. You are so young,  and you have decades to get to where you want to go. And in the mean time,  you get to hang out with your parents. I would give anything to hang out with my parents one more time.",

We ALL coulda woulda shoulda'd our lives better than we did, all you can do is take what you learned and apply it going forward!",

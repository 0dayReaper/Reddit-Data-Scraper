    "postText": "Hey, \n\nLooking to potentially move my IRA from Charles Schwab over to Merrill Edge. Currently, the IRA is invested in SWYNX and the plan would be to continue investing in target date funds. Is it possible to continue investing in SWYNX and are there any new  or increased fees that I'm not accounting for? I have enough to qualify for Platinum status in the Preferred Rewards Program today and Platinum Honors in a few months.",

Other than credit card cash back, from what I can tell you mostly avoid fees that other banks don\u2019t charge and reduce various costs that still don\u2019t make BoA competitive with better lenders.\n\nThey look great, but I think you do better by just going outside the Merrill/BoA system. Except for the cash back, that\u2019s nice.",

I get up to 5.25% cash back on a card with no annual fee, I get a free safe deposit box at the bank, the integration between boa and ME is seamless. Best of all their customer service has been amazing to me. I imagine Merill Edge has a lot less customers then fidelity and schwab..so whenever I have called I am speaking to a real person in a couple minutes. I also think their user interface is great but that is subjective.",

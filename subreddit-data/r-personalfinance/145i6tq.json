    "postText": "Per the title, I keep getting a call from Century Credit asking for my sister.  I have asked for their reason for wanting to contact my sister and they keep telling me they can't discuss it and that they'll mark me as a wrong number, yet I get a call from them weeks or months later for the same issue.  I've talked to my sister about it and she claims not to know about any debt.  Getting these calls is getting somewhat annoying and downright troubling.  Regardless of whether my sister is being honest or not, what is my recourse here?  Do I send a cease and desist letter?  Do I contact the FTC?  How can I get these companies to stop calling me?",

What kind of clothes do they were in that place?\n\nThey'll stop calling because it'll cause their stats to drop.\n\nAlso this might help, [https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2020/09/have-you-gotten-collection-call-about-debt-you-dont-recognize](https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2020/09/have-you-gotten-collection-call-about-debt-you-dont-recognize)",

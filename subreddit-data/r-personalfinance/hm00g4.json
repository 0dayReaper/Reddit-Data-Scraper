    "postText": "Hi everyone, while going over transactions in preparation for filing my taxes, I noticed quite a large charge on my business checking from Wendy\u2019s. I thought I must have bought lunch for my crew, but then it struck me as odd that the amount was $70 even. So I checked the account for all Wendy\u2019s transactions, and it looks like someone had been charging my card at Wendy\u2019s for a total of $2,214 from April 2019 - Aug 2019. Now to my actual question. What the heck can I do about it now? I bank with BofA (I know, I know...) and the transactions are now old. Do I have any recourse whatsoever? Thanks everyone for your feedback.\n\nEdit: Mint was classifying payments made via CashApp to a worker (Wendy), as Fast Food at Wendy\u2019s. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

If you have goals like buying or building a house it\u2019s really helpful to take that time instead of looking at checking/savings and saying \u201cyeah, I have enough.\u201d\n\nLooking at everything regularly forces me to be aware of the interest I\u2019m paying on debts and decide if wanting new curtains is THAT important.\n\n\nEdit because Reddit won\u2019t let me add comments for some reason:\n\nI have everything set on autopay. My income fluctuates wildly from several sources, so I have to be meticulous and find the time I spend working toward my goals valuable. With YNAB as a software tool, it\u2019s much more fun than when I worked on paper or with Excel. Last month, I had 80 transactions (low with less frequent grocery store and restaurant purchases) and 13 normal accounts, plus a bajillion Nelnet student loan accounts because that\u2019s how Nelnet wants to service my loans. Absolutely, I could do this all in 2 hours per month... and at the same time forget that I\u2019m working toward my goals and not see the progress I\u2019m making on debts/savings.\n\nCurtains was my example of \u201can impulse buy.\u201d I don\u2019t need new curtains; mine are fine and I\u2019d rather have the money toward a down payment.\n\nDifferent approaches work for different people. If you can do everything for your financial health, including planning for the future, in ten minutes a month, that\u2019s great! My process works to protect me.",

So I called, disputed the charges, and went ahead and cancelled the card.  The next day I find two charges for Zumies that summed up to $500 on my other account...  Called again, disputed, and cancelled *that* card (My wife and I each have a card for every account.)  The NEXT day I see a charge from Pizza Hut in a state 1,000 miles away on my wife's card for our \"Bill Pay\" account after they said theyd be monitoring our accounts for the next few weeks.",

    "postText": "Hopefully this is the right place to post this, I read the guidelines and I think it is. My wife\u2019s grandmother was fleeced to the tune of $21,000 from one of her grandsons and I am looking for some advice on what we can do in regards to getting it labeled as fraud or get him to pay it back.\n\nA little backstory. Grandma has always paid grandson to do manual labor around the house. We\u2019ve always known that she overpaid him, but it\u2019s never been more than a couple projects every few months. We\u2019re talking like paying him $300 - $1000 bucks to paint some rooms, build some shelving, put in vinyl flooring etc all the while buying all the supplies and tools and letting him keep the tools. We\u2019ve told her that she shouldn\u2019t and she could hire someone for cheaper but he\u2019s her baby, he\u2019s 40, and he could really use the extra money. She technically could afford it and it\u2019s her money so we\u2019ve always just kind of stood on the side saying she really shouldn\u2019t.\n\nWithin the last year he put her credit card on his uber eats account and shopify and ran up a bill without her knowing for like a grand in a month. She didn\u2019t know how long he had been doing it and willfully didn\u2019t want to go and look outside of the one big month. I offered to do the work for her but she declined. She cancelled the card, we talked with her said don\u2019t trust him and we thought that was that.\n\nFast forward a few months she loaned him like $10k for a car because his broke down. He\u2019s been working around her house to pay it off, but she still pays him some cash and then deducts a little off to count it as a payment. Again, we tell her that\u2019s not the way it works but he\u2019s her baby and she tells us it\u2019s her money and she can do what she wants because she worked her whole life for it. He\u2019s still working and \u201cpaying it off\u201d on a regular basis so we just chalked it up to she\u2019s overpaying him again.\n\nAgain fast forward a few months to the last month or two. Turns out she opened a home improvement store credit card so he could do some work for her and buy the supplies and tools he needed. Yea you know where this is going. He ran up a $21,000 dollar bill. The credit card company understandably wouldn\u2019t do anything about it because she opened the card and gave it to him. She does not have the money to pay it off.\n\nLong story short she kind of went off the deep end the last 3 months, bought a Cadillac @ a $900 a month payment, went on a few vacations, purchased a $10k embroidery machine, basically blew through the last of her savings. She still has a pension payment that is enough to cover her basic expenses like car payment, bills and food but not enough with the new credit card payment.\n\nHealth problems have landed her in the hospital for the last few days which is how we found out. She\u2019s worried about being able to pay for everything. We know she\u2019s most likely not going to want to press charges against grandson. What can we do about the credit card charges if she ends up not wanting to press charges? Just looking to be pointed in the right direction here and if there is anything we can do?\n\nAlso kind of important. Grandma is bi-polar manic and over the last year or two has really went downhill. The last few months was exponential to say the least. She randomly decides to stop taking her meds on occasion which usually results in these  spending sprees where the grandson has been able to take advantage. It\u2019s never been more than a few hundred dollars to maybe a grand in the past, but it appears he really went over the top this time. When she got the Cadillac like 2 months ago the family started talking about options for power of attorney since she has the medical issue, and what we think is possibly early onset dementia. This has expediated the talks. Not looking for advice on the medical stuff, just put here for context.\n\nUpdate: Grandma just got to our house. Turns out she never received the credit card and grandson has been taking the home appliance statements out of her mailbox so she wouldn't see them.\n\nUpdate 2: The amount has grown to $31,000 on 2 credit cards. She authorized the purchases for the work to her house. Everything else was not and the 1 credit card was stolen without her knowledge. We are going to file a police report in the AM and start the official process to see what can be done. Any more advice is appreciated. I will let the siblings know about contacting APS because I believe that may be necessary due to the medical issues that have been prevalent in the past and the possible dementia now. ",

What you\u2019ve described is the former, not the latter.\n\nYou can petition the court for guardianship if you believe grandma is no longer capable of making her own decisions, but as long as grandma is considered a legally competent adult, she\u2019s free to make all the bad decisions she wants.",

You can get those stopped, but you can't stop them from suing her, which they will when the debt is for such a large amount. They will be able to get a judgement against her, force her to sell off assets, etc. What she needs to do now is talk to a credit counselor and to APS. If she's lucky, they can help her negotiate a debt reduction or a longer repayment plan that reduces the monthly payment size. But it's unrealistic to expect the debt can be ignored until she passes.",

    "postText": "A few days ago some \"kids\"  (late teens early twenties) came to my door selling magazines. They had a whole story about points and earning a trip that I didn't believe at all, but I just wanted them to go away so I ended up buying a magazine subscription. It was incredibly stupid and not at all like me, but I guess their tactics were successful - I was flustered and they took advantage of that. Yes, I should have just shut the door on them but I didn't. Let's move past that lol.\n\nI paid with a check. My husband is FREAKING out that they will use that info to steal my identity and that I've made the biggest mistake ever. I acknowledge that it was dumb and I feel like an idiot, but am I really at risk of identity theft? Besides charging me way too much for a years worth of magazines, what are the consequences here? \n\nI know I can probably stop the check, right? What other steps do I need to take? Ugh...a moment of weakness, am I going to be paying for this for life?\n\nEdit: thank y'all for the reassurance. I did remember the same of the company I cut the check to and looked it up, it seems like it's more of a pyramid scheme thing than an outright scam. Lesson learned!",

I would say odds on this is completely legit and the worst thing you\u2019ve done is signed yourself up for a magazine you don\u2019t need and made known you\u2019re an easy mark for the next fundraiser.\n\nIf you have it, google the name of the fundraiser or check in with the school / organization to feel more confident about it.",

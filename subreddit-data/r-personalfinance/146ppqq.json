    "postText": "I've got a remote work job paying 14$ per hour at 40 hours a week. I have to move out of my roommate situation, and kinda am willing to move anywhere on the Eastern US (East of Nevada, ig). Where is a good place to have a manageable rent with this kind of job, and what's a good way to budget? I'm currently in Atlanta, and it seems a lot of the rent sites don't have much of anything below $1000 a month. I'm willing to get a roommate, though I'm not entirely sure the best ways to search for one. Any advice appreciated, thanks!",

Do be aware though, crime in St Louis very high, it\u2019s typically listed as 1 or 2 in the most dangerous cities list. I live in a high traffic, very walkable part of the city where baseball games and concerts are, and our one bedroom loft is 1400. My parents live maybe 30 away and pay 1200 for 3x the size though. But there is not too much around besides food, car shops, and smallest businesses. Kind of just depends what you need day to day and if you drive. But the most bang for buck places are going to be in the Midwest, maybe Texas.",

If near a college/university, check all the off-campus housing.",

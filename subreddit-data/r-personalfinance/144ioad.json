    "postText": "Hello I have investments with multiple brokerages and have been using a financial advisor that I want to leave. I would like to have all or most investments in a brokerage with a good mobile app and low fees.\n\nWith my current financial advisor I have investments on TD Ameritrade, but that is supposed to migrate to Charles Schwab in September. He has been kind and educated me a lot, but I realized last year his fees were over $600. With him I have the following accounts:\n\nIndividual (just my own contributions): $65,000 in actively managed etfs: 18% VUG, 14% SPYV, 11% SPYG, and a wide variety of others.\n\nRoth IRA: $22,000, I have maxed out the past few years and have 1,700 left to contribute this year, plan to keep maxing out. It is actively managed: 50% ITOT, 20% VEA, 10% BND\n\nRollover IRA (401k from old job) $16,000, don\u2019t plan to add more is actively managed, basically the same as Roth.\n\nI also have a Robinhood account where I foolishly invest in weed stocks, which I want to keep because I\u2019m long. Also have some random individual stocks I buy and some SPY ~$5000 between all of it.\n\nAnd my new employer will contribute 3% to a 401k, I plan to contribute 5%, this will be on Vanguard.\n\n\nShould I just cancel financial advisor and move both my TD and Robinhood accounts in to Vanguard? I haven\u2019t used vanguard before but enjoy the ease of investing with Robinhood. \n\nAlso, what should I do with the various positions in my individual account? Leave them as be? Consolidate in to other ETFs? How should I break that up?  \n\nOther info: I\u2019m not in any debt, usually spend between $2-3k/month between set costs and indulgences. Base salary of $50,000 on pace to make $15-20k commission.\n\nEdit: medium risk tolerance. In my late 20s, good career trajectory to earn more later. Would like to purchase a home eventually, and potentially new car in next 3 years.",

You'll average 8-10% a year over a long period (with peaks and valleys, some of which will include losses, sometimes big ones).",

Just use index funds, they have well documented risk levels for their various portfolios, spend a couple hours doing research, pick a few index funds in line with your risk tolerance, then set it and forget it.",

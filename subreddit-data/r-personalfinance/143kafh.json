    "postText": "I don't know where to properly begin.\n\nI'll start from the beginning I guess.\n\nIn the late 90's I received a settlement for ~1.2m USD. I took 300k in a home, most of the rest went to lawyers and assorted costs, and 50k went to my mom. A bunch went into a structured settlement that I live on.\n\nMy mom put that 50k into a house. She died in March 2022 and the home sold for 950k. My sister and I are beneficiary's to 60% of that 950k. And I'm a creditor to the estate for the original 50k. Yeah... No interest on that loan. 50k in 94/96 50k today. Whatever. I was a minor and knew very little. So, I'm looking at the 50k and about 260k or roughly 310k.\n\nI'm an engineer now and still know very little. That is why I am asking you r/personalfinance\n\nI could really use a little liquidity and maybe the 50k can be that. However, I'm terrified of squandering / wasting / being fucking stupid with the bulk of the ~300k. I'm 46. Have a guaranteed 40k/anum tax free income for the rest of my life , live in China and am looking to move to Thailand so LCOL.\n\nI know very surface level about index funds and the idea of a feudecery. However, I have absolutely no idea how to move forward with anything.\n\nSo. Do any of you amazing people have any incredible advice? Anywhere I should look to educate myself? Any resources to find? someone to...\u00bfGuide? Me? I'm. Kinda dumb when it comes to money. Engines? Electronics? No fucking problem. Investment? I'm a fucking toddler smoking dope.\n\nPlease help.\n\nThanks. BadMiker",

Basically, right now, you are agreeing to give extra money to your sister, whom you did not originally agree to give money to. You gave 50K to your mom who used it to buy an appreciating asset; you are owed the appreciation on that asset. \n\nI can understand feeling like you need to give the money to your sister, or feeling like it will really create a rift in the family if you do otherwise, but I just want to point out that at this time, the way you have structured this, you are choosing to give extra money to your sister that isn\u2019t hers. So only do that if your intention is to give extra money to your sister, separate from your choice a while ago, to give money to your mom. Your sister isn\u2019t entitled to the growth on your money. In other words, I just urge you to be very clear about what it is that you\u2019re choosing to do with your money, and if the answer is \u201cI want to give it to my sister for X reason\u201d fine. But it\u2019s not her money; it just seems like it is because it\u2019s coming out of the house sale.",

She would have died living in rental accommodation. All growth from 50k to nearly 1m is only due to my loan and the loan from my attorney (who made his 25k loan because I paid him 300k after winning my case) however, she paid him back over the last 30 years while she paid me nothing. He got 25k back, I'm getting 50k and 285k in growth. My sister gets 285k for her abuse from my mom. I don't begrudge her. I actually discussed not making a claim for the 50k just to ensure that she got what she felt was fair. She got no justice for her suffering. I did. She had to deal with an abusive, alcoholic, violent mother. I got to deal with an abusive, sexually abusive, negligent foster parent. I'm not sure who got it worse.\n\nMaybe this all makes me a schmuck. She fucking DESERVES compensation. If I'm the only one who is willing to pay it? So fucking be it. I deserved my money. I earned it on my back. Raped over 1000 times. She deserves her money. Cleaning up the vomit of a physically abusive drunk witch. For nearly a decade.\n\nThe value of my inheritance is not the problem. What to do with it so I don't fuck up is.",

That would be the standard advice. \n\nWhat brokerage firm you can use depends on what country you are in. In Thailand, Interactive Brokers: XTB ; Saco Bank are reported by one site to be popular.

If you, you can buy VTI or VT (these are Vanguard funds). From a Thai brokerage, they may not offer these funds, they might only have different funds. Either way, you want a low cost index fund (not an actively traded fund).  Cost should ideally be below 0.1% per year, definitely below 1%.  How it is taxes will depend on the country.

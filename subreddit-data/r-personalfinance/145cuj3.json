    "postText": "1st baby is due in late August and I\u2019ve been saving but don\u2019t know how much to keep in more liquid/easy access accounts for emergencies. Also would like to know if I\u2019m saving enough or where I should improve.\n\nI make roughly $94k /yr and put 10% in a fidelity savings plan worth $67k (employer matches 6% at 100%, $76 per paycheck goes to HSA, plus taxes and other benefits (health, dental, group legal, etc) are deducted. Take home check is about $2400 every 2 weeks. Mortgage is $1200. Car payment is $500. Car insurance $330 for household. Utilities usually around $650 for entire household. $150 goes to a Roth IRA with $16k in it. $400 to an Ally savings account with 4%apr (currently have $4300 there. The rest goes to my local credit union checking/savings (currently $9k in savings which generates almost zero interest. $1k in the checking. I try to shift money to the higher interest savings as much as possible but have been struggling to save much beyond the $400 a month due to lots of medical expenses this year. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 works and has been saving too but I don\u2019t know how much. I know she has about $700 in personal bills each month, of which about $250 is her car which will be paid off before baby is here. She also has student debt, not sure how much remaining. We definitely need to discuss further, but the plan is she will be out of work at least 3 months and her employer will pay I believe 60% her normal income. She currently makes about $50k yr. Ultimately we would like for her to stay out of work even longer if possible, but she has said she doesn\u2019t mind working sooner if needed (I\u2019d love for her to stay home with the baby if she wants).\n\nAll of that said, how much of our money should we keep in cash vs at the local credit union vs in the online savings account where transfers could take several days?\n\nDo you think we are saving enough and do you have any advise on further preparation?",

            "comment": "First off, congrats on the future baby.  \n\nI would suggest having a big picture conversation with your fiance.  You will be sharing repsonsiblity for caring and raising the baby.  You should have a prudent conversation about each other's finances.  How each of you approach money, savings, spending.  Talking about this now will help later on.  Trust me.  \n\nAssuming that you've already done this, I wouldn't worry too much about the location of the cash.  As long as its accessible easily.  Online savings accounts have rates at 4.5%+ and you can grab the cash in a couple of days.\n\nAs far as baby financial planning: It can't hurt to have extra cash around.  There's always something that comes up with kids.  Always.  Just save more in cash, because there's going to be something.\n\nLastly, consider opening a 529 for the baby, as soon as you get the SSN.  Start saving.  Maybe something small, like $25/mo or $50/mo.  It may sound trivial now, but it'll eventually add up.",

In my area, infant daycare had an average wait-list of 9+ months and costs 1300+/month.\n\nRarely do we need liquid money. For me, I like to keep one month of expenses in a checking account so I never worry about auto payments being overdrafted. It may not be financially optimal, but the peace of mind is worth it.\n\nI'd keep 6 months of expenses (plus your insurance out of pocket max for this year) in a HYSA.",

I would transfer that 9k out of the credit union and put it in ally like yesterday though. Your savings seems fine. I would focus on upping the contribution to your fidelity account if that is a pretax account.",

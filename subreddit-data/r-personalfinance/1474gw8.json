    "postText": "Hi Personal Finance Reddit, \n\nI am going back and forth with this. I am working to try and get out of debt. I am debating on if I should sell my car or not. Below are the details. \n\nI make $76k a year and currently have $46K in debt broken down by the following: \n\n1. $29K in student loans \n2. $17K car loan ( Car worth $28K) \n\nI really do like the car but probably know if I sold it and traded down it would perhaps speed up the process. \n\nIf you were in my shoes what would you do?",

How much longer before the car is paid off? \n\nDo you need a car? Is there any problem with the car, or is it expensive to maintain? \n\nIf you bought the car new, you've already paid for most of the depreciation, and so it might be better to keep the car, and not worry about having to buy another one for 10 years or so.",

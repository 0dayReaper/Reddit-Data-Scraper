I work full time, and trouble is I run a charity too so that takes up my weekends. \n\nI do art but that's time intensive. I sell digital cards which makes \u00a330-\u00a340 a month.\n\nEdit: I like creative crafts so I wonder if I should start another side hustle that isn't as time intensive as my art.",

For a while it was pretty successful. \n\nIt's spring. Folks are working in their gardens. You could offer to help pull weeds, and other general labor.\n\nThere's side work anyone can do, but you might do better if you consider your strengths, abilities, and assets. It also depends on your availability. Do you need something that can be done at home?",

It will pay off a lot more in the long run.",

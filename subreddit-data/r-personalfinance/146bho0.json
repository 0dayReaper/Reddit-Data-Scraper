    "postText": "Hi all. I\u2019ve just been made aware that last month, my pharmacy billed the wrong insurance for a prescription. (For background, I left a job in late April and my health insurance benefits were terminated so the plan should\u2019ve been inactive. I started a new job and new health insurance kicked in on May 1, so at the time of billing I was insured - just not by the insurer that the pharmacy billed. That insurer approved and paid the claim anyway). I\u2019ve contacted the pharmacy and they\u2019re unable to re-bill the new insurance. I have two questions: \n\n1. Is my best bet to pay back the old insurance for the costs they incurred for this prescription, then see if the new insurance will allow me to submit a claim for reimbursement? \n\n2, and more worrying. This claim by the pharmacy started a COBRA plan that I didn\u2019t opt into, and the premiums are far beyond what I can pay. My understanding is that, if I don\u2019t pay the COBRA premiums, the healthcare plan is terminated. Is that correct? Do I need to do more than address this one charge with my pharmacy? \n\nThank you in advance for the help.",

Sounds more like they just *won't.* I've had bills re-submitted several times by sloppy providers.\n\n*My understanding is that, if I don\u2019t pay the COBRA premiums, the healthcare plan is terminated. Is that correct?* \n\nProbably, but you should contact the COBRA administrator directly and tell them you're terminating. Don't just wait and hope it sorts itself out.",

                    "comment": "Thank you for this reply. The pharmacy said they\u2019re unable to re-bill past the one week mark (which is of course way before I learned any of this had happened!). Pharmacy is subpar in general, gave me the run around on which insurance they billed before finally telling me what I could see on the insurer\u2019s website from the jump. Annoying, but I\u2019m more concerned about getting sent to collections than I am about being right, so imagine that negotiating with the pharmacy is a lost cause - just won\u2019t use them again. \n\nNotes on the COBRA. I\u2019ll do that. Thank you.",

            "comment": "Hello I am a pharmacist. While there is a limit as to how far back you can change billing on a prescription, you are nowhere near that mark. The thing that doesn't make sense is that pharmacy billing is real time so if your first insurance was terminated it should have rejected, so it sounds like it was active. As to whether or not this was a mistake,  I cannot say, but I can say that a pharmacy claim CANNOT start COBRA coverage.\n\nAt this time, your pharmacy is under no obligation (at least by Texas law, which is what I'm familiar with) to rebill your claim as they received confirmation (going back to real time billing) that everything was legit. You are also under no obligation to ever go back there. At this time what you need to do is call the first insurance company and sort out COBRA coverage and confirm the date of submission the pharmacy submitted for the claim. If the pharmacy claim date is wrong, they need to correct it otherwise that is insurance fraud. \n\nI can't comment anymore than this as things can get very complicated very fast but hopefully this explains things some and can help you out with your first step.",

I have confirmed via the old insurer\u2019s website that my coverage has been inactive since my employment termination date, and I have documentation from the insurer and from my employer stating the same. As I\u2019ve been frantically googling how this could\u2019ve happened, I\u2019ve learned that apparently it\u2019s not unheard of for insurers to approve and pay claims on inactive plans, and then review the payment and bill someone for that amount.\n\nI will call the old insurance first thing in the morning on Monday; I sent them a message in the meantime. Do you know whether, if I reimburse the insurance for costs incurred, this goes away? Just really don\u2019t want to get sent to collections over an error.",

I imagine they will be much more interested in rebilling the claim now you have proof they will no longer be paid for your prescription. If they still refuse, then wait to see if you actually get a bill. \n\nIf your old insurance sends you a bill , you don't pay it. You have insurance to handle medical bills remember? Contact your new insurance and ask them what to do. You should probably go ahead and do this regardless. They'll probably say the pharmacy needs to rebill the claim. Explain the situation and have them 3 way with you and the pharmacy to readjudicate the claim.\n\nYou have done nothing wrong. The only thing you should be paying is whatever the copay for your drug should have been on the correct insurance plan. If it is greater than what you initially paid, the honest thing to do would be to pay the pharmacy the difference,  though they are being dicks so screw them. If it is less than what you initially paid, you howl and bitch at the pharmacy they need to be refunding you the difference, even if it's 10 cents. Do not accept store credit. You hold the cards in this situation as you have your meds and now the pharmacy has to get their shit together if they want to be paid.",

            "comment": "It may also have to do with the exact date and the company. Most pay their insurance premiums on the 1st for each month and at least for the corp I worked for we never called and cancelled insurance mid month, rode out to the end of the month.\n\nHas anyone asked you for any $$?\n\nCOBRA as far as I remember you have 30 days to decide whether you want it or not and can cancel at any time during that month or do nothing (which is what I usually did). Once the COBRA was cheaper than going on the exchange so I sent the Premium.   \nNever had an issue. The worst that can happen is the 1st insurance asks for the money back from the pharmacy or you. At which time you can probably just pay and submit a claim with the new insurance for payment?",

I left my employment mid-April; my old insurance would still have been outdated at the time of billing (first week of May) but I was covered by new insurance by then. I should\u2019ve been more diligent about making sure the right insurance info had been transferred to the pharmacy by the doc, so lesson for next time. \n\nNo one has asked me for any $ - I just don\u2019t want it sent to collections. I am EXTREMELY lucky that this mixup happened on a prescription that was only about $150 (the doctor visit itself was over $1000) but I\u2019d like to get it resolved before my credit score gets dinged over it. Thank you so much for the reply about COBRA, that puts my mind at ease.",

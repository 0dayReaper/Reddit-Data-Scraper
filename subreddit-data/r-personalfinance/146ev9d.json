    "postText": "When iOS 17 was announced I was hoping that my iPhone 8 Plus would be supported for another year and I would replace my battery in the fall when the OS would be released. However, it turns out that Apple dropped support for my phone so I was wondering if it makes sense financially to replace the battery and keep using it until my important apps are no longer supported?",

[https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+8+Plus+Battery+Replacement/98260](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPhone+8+Plus+Battery+Replacement/98260)\n\nThen, if you want a new phone, put money aside for it in a HYSA until you have enough. I've been happy with Apple's refurbished phones.",

It is still working fine after over 5 years, and the battery was way cheaper than a new robot vacuum.\n\nOn phones, however, there is a limit. Sometimes apps need way more memory and new devices stop working with the old devices.",

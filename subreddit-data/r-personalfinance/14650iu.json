    "postText": "Hi - I am a college student studying Computer Science going into my senior year and am looking to buy a car this year. I will save enough money from my summer internship to be able to put down $10k for the down payment. I also will be a teaching assistant during the school year and earn around $700 a month. My credit score is 760+. I have done some vague research on the car-buying process, but I really am still very very lost. I have a couple of questions that I am hoping you might be able to help with:\n\n1. What is a reasonable budget to set for buying a car within the next few months?\n2. Would I be able to get an auto loan?\n3. I wasn't sure how to fill in my income since my internship is only for the summer and my teaching assistant position doesn't seem like it would be of much help. If I have a full-time job offer for when I graduate, would that be factored in?\n\nAny and all advice is appreciated - thank you for reading and for your time!\n\nEDIT: Thoughts on leasing a car for 2 years instead? Is that possible and a good decision?",

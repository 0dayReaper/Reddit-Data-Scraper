    "postText": "Please don\u2019t light me up. I don\u2019t post on Reddit much but I really need some advice on how to create a clear and concise budget.  \n\nSo, I created a budget for my live in partner and I a couple of months ago using google sheets. The main 2 pages of this budget, which correspond to my bills and income and hers on the second page. In each of these sheets the split bills (rent, Netflix, utilities, etc.) are included on both sheets. At the top of the first row are the bills (each in their own column) the totals for each pay period and the projected amount due for that pay period. \n\nI also created a joint account and calculated an \u201cinitial buffer\u201d so that each paycheck we could allocate the same amount. This way we could compensate for the fluctuations in our bills like how most of the bills come out on the first. Much more than we can afford in a single pay period. \n\nSo I build this with the intention of stabilizing our income across pay periods and also to separate the necessary bills vs personal spending. \n\nIt worked good for a couple of months until she got her hours cut and both of our vehicles went to crap. Not complaining it\u2019s just life. The issue is that in order to make adjustments to the budget I have to manually go through each column and update every month manually and it\u2019s a cumbersome spreadsheet to sort out. I didn\u2019t create it with any real adjustability. \n\nI\u2019ve looked into google forms and google apps and, even though I do have some coding knowledge, it seems like a pretty extreme undertaking to build a form to make changes to the budget sheet, like paydays or deleting/ updating a bill.  \n\nBut my biggest issue here is that paydays and bills don\u2019t align. I need to be able to budget to the dollar (roughly) and in a way that will be adjusted for the fact that paychecks and bills are constantly out of cycle. \n\nI\u2019ve been googling and all the personal finance stuff just talks about \u201ctracking your spending\u201d or \u201ccreate a monthly budget\u201d. Like yeah, I get that. My personal spending habits are well under control. What they don\u2019t say is how do I create a consistent budget to automate my bills.\n\nThere has to be an app out there that doesn\u2019t charge an arm and leg to manage my bills where I can easily get a total and equal amount that I should pay each paycheck and that doesn\u2019t follow a monthly cycle. Monthly cycles are garbage because they don\u2019t line up with income!! \n\nAnyways. I\u2019m ripping my hair out. Any advice or tutorials or YouTube videos or budget templates would be greatly appreciated. I\u2019m at my wits end with this shit and I don\u2019t have the time to recreate the wheel.",

            "comment": "Yes, you are overcomplicating things. Separate your budget from your tracking and accounting. \n\nBasically a budget is just a list of categories and the amounts that go to them. You can go as far as grouping the categories. Also group the fixed expenses (rent/mortgage, car payment, subscriptions, etc) from your variable expense (groceries, gas, dining, hobbies, misc). There should also be a savings category.\n\nNow this is the trick: You should only care to track your variable expenses, and it doesn't matter where the money lands. For example the total for my variable expenses is $2,000, so my only concern is that I don't blow past $2,000. I'm looking at the last two months and on April I was bellow on groceries but above during May. It doesn't matter, $2k is what I have to stay bellow. Heck in February and march I was redoing my floors, so I raided my usual categories; I stopped eating out and hobbies and used the money for boxes of flooring. I still was under my $2k budget. Just for accuracy I may adjust my budget to more accurately reflect any given one, but in general it probably won't affect my $2k budget for variable expenses.",

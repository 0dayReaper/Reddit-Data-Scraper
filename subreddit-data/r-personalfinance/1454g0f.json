I\u2019ve been looking for ways to get ahead and be more financially secure. I have no savings, no financial help, or assets to speak of. \nI am looking for long and short term solutions to have more income so I can afford to be more comfortable, go to college, etc. I will put in the work but I am totally lost on these things.",

            "comment": "Any bank that can show FDIC coverage (or NCUA for credit unions) will be \"safe\" in terms of you not at risk of losing money if the institution itself fails.  At least up to a balance of $250k per bank.\n\nEarned interest will vary a bit, but most options will fall into one of two categories.  A \"typical\" bank, with branches and stuff, is likely to be under 1%; sometimes a lot under and sometimes effectively 0%.  A \"High Yield Savings Account\" will be in the range of 3.5% to 4%.  These will usually be online only, which does make your balance a bit more difficult to access.  You have to transfer it somewhere you can cash out.  You can get a checking account alongside an HYSA at some places which would come with a linked debit or ATM card.\n\nA money market account or money market fund (if there's even any difference) probably won't get you a rate much higher than a regular savings account.  Buying bonds or CDs might beat a savings rate, but then your money is a bit more \"locked up\", so you'd have to weight that against any marginal benefit.\n\n&gt;Popular bank has weird rules with transferring money. \n\nAre you talking about the \"6 transfers out per month\" limitation?  That was primarily due to federal regulations and applied to most accounts.  Though that particular regulation was waived during covid (and may still be inactive), and different banks have done things differently about enforcement.  But if this is for a somewhat other than regular spending, you usually don't need too many transfers anyway, so even if it's enforced that restriction may not have much impact on you.  IIRC there are mechanisms for moving money out of an account that don't count against that, but I'm not 100% sure.\n\nTL/DR: any bank with FDIC coverage, low (ideally no) fee, and easy online access would probably be good enough.  Rates change at varying schedules at different places, but chasing the highest is usually more trouble than its worth.\n\nI've had Ally for a HYSA for a few years, and it's worked fine for me.",

                    "comment": "Money market funds are mutual funds through brokerages. Money market accounts are savings accounts with a few quirks. Despite the name and the fact that they\u2019re interest-paying accounts, they\u2019re different under the hood. In particular, MMAs are FDIC ensured, and MMFs are not, and although it\u2019s unlikely to matter, can.\n\nSix transfers out is no longer a federal regulation, but many banks maintain it or charge for excess withdrawals. Other banks don\u2019t limit it. You have to read the bank\u2019s fine print. \n\nSavings accounts now go up beyond 5% if you just want to put money in and leave it alone, but if that\u2019s your plan there are even better rates available. For total liquidity that\u2019s not bad, though!",

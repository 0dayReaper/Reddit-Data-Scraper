    "postText": "Throw away account for reasons.\n\n  \nMy wife and I are 24 and 25. We just started making 127k combined. My wife does not have a retirement fund of any kind. I have an Edward Jones Roth IRA account I started when I was 20 with 13k in it. After reading on Reddit, I know I should get out of EJ as fast as possible. We have 17k in an emergency fund. My car is paid off. Her car has 10k left at 5.9% interest. My student loans are at 25k with 4% interest. Mortgage has 190k left at 5.4% interest. I'm contributing to my company's 401k, HSA, and ESOP.\n\n  \nShould I transfer my EJ Roth IRA to a Vanguard Roth IRA? Should my wife set up a Roth IRA with Vanguard too? Putting as much into VTSAX as possible? Or should I follow the portfolio make up my EJ account has currently? Should I be paying off debts faster than the minimum amount?",

It's not a given, but it's a good idea.\n\nYour wife should at least start a Roth IRA, as there is a 5 year period where she can't withdraw without penalty, so putting $1 in a roth IRA is ALWAYS the right move.\n\nGiven your salary, I'd max your Roth each year, just to hedge against any future tax increases, then go whole hog into a 401k.",

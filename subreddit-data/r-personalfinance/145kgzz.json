I am looking to pull a loan of about $600 but am able to pay it back within a week.\n\nMy credit at the moment of writing this is 718 with about a year of credit history.\n\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

It had the lowest interest rates when I applied and got approved, and they both had good customer service/support. You don't have to take out any of these personal loans I mentioned, but that's my experience.\n\nYou should also be able to qualify with a lower interest rate since your score is 718.",

    "postText": "Hello :) this is my second post here asking about CA unclaimed properties. I received some amazing help on my first post so I\u2019m very grateful for this community!\n\nIt seems that I will receive a physical check to my mailing address once my claim is approved. It is quite a lot of money, and I\u2019m kind of worried about the possibility of the check being lost in shipping, due to the fact that my mailing address is overseas.\n\nHas anyone gone through the process of receiving their check overseas? Did you get a package/mail tracking number? Were you able to track the mail?\n\nIf the check was lost, would I be able to report a lost check and file the claim again? \n\nThank you so much for anyone trying to help!",

No direct deposit, etc.\n\nWarrant cannot be rerouted, must go to the listed address.\n\nEdit: If you are claiming some large amount. It's possible you might be able to make some arrangement for picking up or using a courier to deliver the check. This would require you to call and arrange special handling. Extremely rare but have seen it done.",

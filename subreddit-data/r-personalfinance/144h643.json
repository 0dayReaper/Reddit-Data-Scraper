    "postText": "My car (2010 subaru forester) sustained horrible damage when the engine blew up. The damage to fix surpasses the cost of the car \u2014$9k estimate and lots of trouble finding a reliable engine. I owe about $3k. \n\nMy credit isn\u2019t great, i\u2019m in college and right now don\u2019t have any savings or make a ton of money. I\u2019m curious how I get out of this. I want to call the finance company and explain but I really just need to car and the loan gone with as little damage to me as possible. The car is currently 50 miles away at a mechanic \u2014 who needs it gone in a week. I just need to find the right path to take to get over this huge stressor.  I\u2019ll be charged by the day to store it and I just can\u2019t do that. It needs a place to go now and I kind of just want to call and have the loan person pick it up. \n\nI live in a moderately expensive coastal city and can definitely get by using public transportation. Until I graduate in 6 months and find a better paying job I\u2019m kind of ok saving money.",

Reach out to a junk yard who will probably pay you $150 and pick it up in case nobody messages you online.\n\nYou graduate in 6 months and are willing to use public transport for that time, so do that. Pay off the loan by the time you graduate so you're in a spot to get a new car then in case you can't use public transit in your new job.",

Did it put a window in the block?",

Some people have multiple credit card because each one gets better rewards on a specific thing, but it\u2019s not good to open a ton of cards at once.  \n  \nBut the first thing you boule always do is set up auto-pay for the full statement balance (not just the minimum). I even use auto-pay as a backup as I manually make sure to pay off cards about every week.",

Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors.",

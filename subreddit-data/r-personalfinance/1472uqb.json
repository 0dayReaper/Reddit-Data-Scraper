    "postText": "I was owed 'retro pay' about $80. They issued me a regular week's paycheck/stub but in the deductions they deducted the full net minus the $80 I'm left with\n\nI call accounting to explain that this will mess with my taxes and is just plain incorrect. .they feign ignorance and doesn't recognize what im trying to explain as far as taxes go ..that I'm receiving X but only got a small portion of it but the entire thing goes towards my AGI\n\nHow do I put into words how to push this accounting dept in the right direction as far as fixing this for my taxes goes?\n\n\n...\n\n...\n\nEdit ;    if my weekly gross pay is 2k. And they deduct taxes I'm netting 1.5k. They deducted 1.42k as a deduction line item and left me with $80-which is the correct monies. But the fact they taxes 2k added to my AGI is the problem. So I received my normal weekly check. No prob there. Then my retro pay check was another full week's pay but on the deduction line they deducted most of the net to leave $80. My AGI will be one week's worth higher now\n\nRetro pay was a few bucks because our contract had a tiny raise in it and they owed me that tiny raise from a week back. My current hourly has been updated to the newest contract. Everyone received these same retro checks but mine was done as described. Everyone else just had $80-100 in retro pay in a separate check and taxed correctly . Mine was for a full weeks pay..then taxed(correctly), then deducted to leave me the 80...instead of just the retro check gross for 90ish and then taxed leaving me $80",

I only need 1 per week. Therefore my agi went up double a weekly amount. Clearly indicated by checking ytd on check\n\n This is obviously different and unusual which is why I'm looking for advice. The payroll company is feigning ignorance but I know for certain this isn't the correct way to go about it.  I read this sub religiously,  I am.also an avid researched of personal finance, taxes,insurances, etc for my entire life dating back as a kid. It's not that I don't know what I'm talking about , it's just hard to put into concise words what's going on and how to fix it \n\n   My employer owes me my weekly monies. They also owe me 80 bucks from something else\n\nSo instead of giving me 1 weekly check and the $80...they gave me TWO full checks, but one is deducted to leave me with 80. Therefore I made double my weekly this week (adds to my AGI end of year)",

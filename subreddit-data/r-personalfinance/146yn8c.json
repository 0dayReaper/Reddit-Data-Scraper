    "postText": "We bought a starter home in late 2020 - 2.5% interest rate, but 1500 sqft, no master bedroom suite, no garage, and all of the living space is together. We bought for $399k, and the house has appreciated to something around $450-$475k.\n\nThe plot is fairly large, and I've had it in my head that we could build an addition to expand when we needed it (thinking of starting a family soon) instead of moving. There's a lot of softer pros/cons (e.g. hassle of moving v hassle of managing a building project, we've just gotten the yard the way we want it, location is great, etc).\n\nDepending on who I talk to, some people think it's a great idea and some people think I'm crazy.\n\nThe way I'd calculate whether this is a financially sound decision, is to basically say, to \"upgrade\", we'd probably be looking for houses in the $650-700k range. Let's call it $200k more than our selling price. However, due to interest rates, I'd be paying a higher interest rate on more money if we got a new mortgage, as opposed to paying a higher interest rate on just the cost of the addition. I'm also assuming that we'd put 100% of the sale price of our current home into the new home (still owe $295k on the current home, but there's closing costs too - assuming 8% of $450k is $36k, which means we'd net about $119k in the sale of our current home, leaving the new mortgage to be around $531k.\n\nSo, my comparison is, [current mortgage + 8% interest on $200k+property tax increase] versus [new home mortgage, 8% interest on $530k+property taxes+insurance]. Am I missing anything here?\n\nMy numbers wind up around $2000+$1400+$250 v $3700+$840+$100 (all in respective order). That means $3650 v $4640 per month.\n\nIs there anything I'm missing? With about $1000 difference, I'd think there's some wiggle room with assumptions like interest rate and sales price and things like that.\n\nFeedback is appreciated!",

It sounds like you are envisioning a substantial addition to double your square footage and add a garage, and $200k may not be enough. \n\nMoving is a hassle, but living in a construction zone and dealing with contractors working on your home for a month or more is also a big hassle. I'd lean towards moving unless you really, really love your location and you want to stay for the next several decades.",

It wound up at $100k, so we cancelled the project, but the guy thought we'd be able to build a second story on top for another $50k. (This, adding some fudge because you never know!)\n\nHowever, this guy was pretty slimy and I don't really trust what he said in terms of professional opinion either, so I'm not positive.\n\nI do love the area I live in, and the types of houses around this suburb I'd be looking at are probably $700k unfortunately. My thought is that if I can get what I want laid out how I want it, I might be able to be more efficient.\n\nBut yeah, it'd be a huge undertaking, so definitely something to think hard on, and get designed out before pulling the trigger.",

    "postText": "We had a family gathering the other day and wanted to do a nice thing in the and and pay for everyone\u2019s dinner. The bill was around $480. I calculated and decided to put $100 as tip. When I got home I noticed the %20 tip had already been calculated and I had paid over %40 tip! This whole almost $600 dinner is nothing that I can really afford, let alone paying this much tip. I feel so bad for the whole scenario and keep thinking how I save my money and not buying anything expensive and now all of a sudden, this amount went right out of my account. I really wanted to show my family that I can do it, but then this overtipping also happened. I feel bad and guilty. What would you do to overcome the feeling",

Furthermore, pay closer attention to details in the future. The tipping situation is terrible right now (forced tips, tip screens for very simple services), we all need to be intentional and careful to not tip unnecessarily.\n\nIt stings, but you\u2019ll get over it with time. I\u2019ve been there and done that, and still think back to my silly moments from time to time and cringe. Keep saving, keep being disciplined, and you should have a lot of time ahead of you to earn and save more.\n\nHope your family enjoyed the meal! \ud83d\ude0c",

I shouldn\u2019t have offered to pay, but unfortunately when I got the bill it was too late to change my mind. Sometimes life lessons are so expensive and painful",

So he tipped on top of the existing tip and tax! DH was embarrassed and didn\u2019t want to have them correct his mistake so we left. \n\nSo, like your bill, our total bill was over $600. And the food and service wasn\u2019t even good to be honest! Only two out of 9 people enjoyed their meal!\n\nAnyway I just considered it like a donation to charity. That server had a very, very nice night out on us I\u2019m sure!!",

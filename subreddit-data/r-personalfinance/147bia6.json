    "postText": "Hey everyone\r  \n\r  \nI am in my early 20s. I just graduated with my bachelors and masters and I make $160K salary. I started work since last September. Below are my debts:\n\n* **Student Loans - 35K at 4%**\n* **2023 Lexus RX350 - 55K at 5% (yes, it's expensive. I wanted to treat myself after college and I do plan on keeping this car for a long time)**\n\n**Here is my savings: $20,000**\n\nHere are my monthly expenses:\n\n* Rent = $1750\n* Car Payment = $1000\n* Internet = $80\n* Electricity = Around $100\n* Groceries = $400 a month\n* Restuarants = $300 a month\n* Gas = $100 a month\n* Entertainment (Spotify, F1 TV, and Youtube Premium) = $49\n* Gym = $110 (Lifetime Fitness, yes it is very expensive, trust me, I want to go to another cheaper gym but other gyms are far away compared to where I live)\n* Taekwondo = $180 (I love taekwondo. It's my passion since I was 4 years old. Currently a 3rd degree black belt, trying to go for 4th end of this year)\n* Miscellaneous = $300 (On anything, could be shopping or travel)\n* **Grand Total = Around \\~ $4700**\n\nWith just contributing the match (6% or $800), I save around $4000 a month. \n\nWith contributing the max, **starting middle of the year**, I save around $2000 a month.\n\nI wanted to ask whether it is better to max out my 401K to reduce my taxable income or contribute only up to the matching (6%) and pay off my debts first (Both student and auto loan) and save more cash for a downpayment for a home after? I thought of paying minimum for both loans since they are low interest and contributing to the 401k more.\r  \n\r\n\nI do think I want a home because I feel my rent money is not really going anywhere. There is no equity. There is nothing gained when I leave. I feel with a home I can gain equity. Only problem is right now is a terrible time to buy a home with high prices and high interest rates. Therefore, I was thinking for the next 2 year, I could save for a large downpayment since I live in an area where townhomes are around $500K and single family homes are around $660K.\r  \n\r  \nOn the other hand, is it better to max out all my tax advantaged accounts (401k, HSA, and Roth IRA)? Only downside is it would take me longer to pay off my debt and save for a house.\n\nI have a long distance relationship too so I also do not know where I would be in the future to be honest.\r  \n\r\r\r  \nWhat are your guy's thoughts? If you need more info, I can provide. What do you guys think?",

Paying off the car more quickly, or saving more for retirement are *both* good uses for your money. The student loan is probably just fine to pay the minimum.\n\nBuy a home when you're ready to buy a home. When your professional and personal life make you think you want to stay in the same place for at least five years. Not because renting is throwing money away (it's exchanging money for a thing you need), and not because you can time the housing market (that's very hard to do). You're in a long distance relationship and you don't know where you're going to end up -- buying a home can be a longer term goal.",

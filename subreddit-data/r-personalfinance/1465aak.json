    "postText": "Please tell me if I'm being stupid or if I understand the stupidity of this correctly. \n\nBought a new house in July 2022 and turned her first small home (the relevant home in this post) into an airbnb. We purchased Short Term Rental Home Insurance in August and canceled our traditional home insurance. Put the new insurance through our escrow. All good. \n\nWe just got an escrow shortage of $3k to be paid back over the next year. From what I can tell, because it wasn't predicted there would be a $2.4k charge (yeah STR insurance is expensive) in August, the account went red by that amount that month. Now we have to pay that into our escrow plus the usual payment (which has gone up a bit due to the more expensive insurance and slight tax increase) to avoid this happening again. Which it shouldn't because it's been adjusted now to account for more expensive insurance.\n\nAm I correct in this? If so, then it seems these payments amount to nothing more than a savings account and it will get refunded next year.",

            "comment": "My mortgage assumes some increase on my insurance year over year. Sometimes they\u2019re correct, sometimes they\u2019re not. It\u2019s hard to tell based on the info you shared but if the account went $2,400 into the negative you owe that plus what they\u2019re predicting next year\u2019s insurance policy to cost which may be that $600 difference over what you paid in previous years. \n\nSay your old policy was $1,200 but next year they expect it to be $1,800 (you would obviously have a better sense of this than we would) you\u2019d have to pay the $2,400 to make the account whole for what\u2019s already been out, than $1,800 for next year\u2019s insurance. The price of your old insurance isn\u2019t really relevant anymore.",

My mortgage company also always has a document in my account explaining the changes whenever my escrow changes so that might be helpful if yours does too. So you\u2019re saying the $3k increase doesn\u2019t include the overage from the insurance going up or the potential increase in insurance costs next year? That seems insane if that\u2019s the cast. Personally I\u2019d call the company and try to speak to someone to see if you can have them manually take a look and if lower it is a possibility.",

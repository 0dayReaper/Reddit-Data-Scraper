    "postText": "I'm 24 and I have zero credit.  Bills have always been in someone else's name so I couldn't have built it that way and I'm currently living with my MIL so I don't have bills(just help with groceries and a few other things). I don't have a very steady income, but I do have enough to finance things and pay them off in a reasonable amount of time. \n\nAre there credit card options for people with zero credit and dont have a high interest rate on the card? I have heard that it's best to not go over 50% of your credit limit so ideally I would like a credit limit of 2000 minimum so I then have 1000 in credits, but I don't know if that's possible seeing as I have no existing credit",

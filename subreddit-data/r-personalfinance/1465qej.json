    "postText": "Hello All-\nMy spouse and I are delving into a few different scenarios as we are in the process of purchasing a house.\n\nBackground:\nWe are taking a loan for approximately 600k at a 7% interest rate for the house. Between cash, investments (not including any retirement investments) and CDs we will have enough resources to pay off the house in a year or so, with a separate emergency fund and buffer in place. \n\nWe are also lucky enough to have decent incomes with my spouse being able to go part time in the next year to support  an expanding family. \n\nWe are now at a point where we would like to decide on a one year payoff plan or extra monthly payments to reduce our interest payments. And we are contemplating whether or not investing vs paying off our house makes more financial sense. \n\nWe also have concerns about losing the mortgage interest deduction on our taxes, as we do have above median incomes. I\u2019ve played with a few different calculators online (using conservative 5% investment calculations) and still have not been able to come to a solid conclusion. Any resources, guidance, or feedback would be much appreciated. Thank you team Reddit!",

The mortgage interest deduction is nothing compared to the actual interest you\u2019ll pay; there\u2019s no reason to pay more interest just so you can deduct some later. That\u2019s similar logic to refusing a raise because \u201cit\u2019ll put you into a higher tax bracket.\u201d",

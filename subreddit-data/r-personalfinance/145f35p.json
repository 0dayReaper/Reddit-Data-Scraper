We don\u2019t think about money in those terms though, we are a team and have the same goals for our future. We also want to share the same lifestyle\u2026 I am always confused when spouses calculate their spending money based on their individual incomes if there is a big difference. Even when we made a lot less money we made sure each person had what they needed/wanted within reason. Now we have a lot of surplus after saving for our retirement goal. Sometimes that means I get a new designer bag and other times my husband gets a new set of golf clubs (as an example). We both know our overall goal and we both want the other person to have the nice things they want with what is leftover. Generally we choose to spend it on travel as a couple or family trips with our child. But as the lower earner, I feel no guilt spending our money as long as we\u2019ve agreed on the purchase and it fits in our plan.",

            "comment": "I think there's two levels to your question: logistics and philosophy.\n\nPhilosophically, my husband and I treat all of our money as shared. We don't keep track of specifically who is spending what nor does our individual incomes influence how much fun money we are allowed to each have. We keep each other in the loop about any big or shared purchases, but we don't police each other's spending at all. If he wants to buy something big, I might be his sounding board and ask him questions about the purchase that help him decide if it's worth the money, but if he says \"this is worth it to me\", I never contest that (and vice versa). It helps that we entered our marriage with similar networths and spending styles. So, generally, we are talking about buying some hobby supplies, not jet skis. This is the only way I'd want to handle finances in a marriage, personally. I find keeping track of who bought dinner last or \"you earn 60% of our income, so you get to spend $37.44 more than me on fun things every month\" super unappealing/exhausting for a long-term partnership. If my partner went bankrupt for reasons out of his control or took on a ton of medical debt, it would be \\*our\\* loss, not his. I wouldn't kick him out if he couldn't pay his share. So I don't see any purpose in pretending that we are each individually responsible for our own savings and money when, in practice, I wouldn't be able to follow through with drawing that boundary if it really came down to it.\n\nLogistically, we have one shared bank account that we started before we got married that some credit cards we opened together around that time are paid from and we've opened another shared checking account in the country we moved to. Otherwise, we generally maintain the same accounts we had before, but all of the money in them is totally fungible. We move it around pretty indiscriminately based on need because we see it all as shared. We probably should do more to merge our finances on paper, but this is less important to me than having a shared vision.",

Keep in mind with this topic that there are plenty of wrong answers, and plenty of answers that \"will work\" but I don't think that there is a \"right\" answer that works for everyone.\n\nMoney does weird things to people, and it does not matter how you handle your finances if you are not both of the same opinion on what is \"right\", it will be a problem. So I think that would be the first thing you need to establish and be on the same page about, how the accounts are handled after that will be much easier.\n\nSome see income as \"theirs\" and allocate funds to joint expenses accordingly, leaving the rest to personal discretion. Some see income as shared equally in the marriage, putting it into one pot and spending from there accordingly. That can work well, especially if finances aren't tight so a little extra spending here or there doesn't impact the other.\n\nWhat my wife and I do is have 4 accounts:\nJoint checking\nMy checking\nHer checking\nJoint savings\n\nAll income is deposited into Joint checking, monthly budgeted items come from there, and a monthly budgeted personal spending amount (equal amount) is transfered to the personal checking accounts. That way we can spend as we need/want to from our personal accounts without issue but consult each other about use of the joint accounts outside the budgeted items.",

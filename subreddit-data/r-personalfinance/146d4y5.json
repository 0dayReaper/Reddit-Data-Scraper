    "postText": "The place where I am working part-time offers 401k for part time employees and honestly I want to invest. \n\nThey stated that \"The company will match 13% of your salary deferrals up to the first 8% of your eligible compensation\". Please explain this whole thing like I am five years old because this is the first time a place has offered 401k for part time employees for me and I don't understanding anything .-.\n\nThank you! ",

            "comment": "That\u2019s complicated wording and pretty poor matching (but better than nothing).  \n  \nThey mean that whatever you put in, they put in 13% of that (so if you put in $100, they add $13 for a total of $113). The limit of this is 8% of your salary, so you get an extra 1.04% of your salary at max.  \n  \n____  \n  \nExamples assuming you make $20k:  \n  \nYou do 5% ($1000), they do 0.65% ($130) for a total of 5.65% ($1130).  \n  \nYou do 8% ($1600), they do 1.04% ($208) for a total of 5.65% ($1808).  \n  \nYou do 10% ($2000), they do still only 1.04% ($208) for a total of ($2208).  \n  \nSo obviously, if you can afford it, do at least 8% to get as much free money as you can. If you don\u2019t know what of the 401k fund options to put the money in, make a second post about that.",

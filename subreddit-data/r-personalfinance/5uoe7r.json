    "postText": "Hey guys! A couple weeks ago I posted about a situation at work where I was promoted to an admin and clinical position, and found out that I was being paid at least a dollar less than entry level employees. I was making $14/hr while others were making anywhere between $14.50 - $15/hr. I asked for advice, and the post BLEW up, to the point where I had to delete do to me being careless with personal info. I received a lot of advice to search for another job, negotiate higher than I was asking, and some PM's asking for my name and location and position in the company, which led to me deleting the post.\n\nAnyway, I met with the woman in charge of wages for my company, and the talk was very friendly and transparent. She said the person hiring people before me was ignoring protocol and absolutely should not have hired people at that rate. She said our range was significantly lower for hiring and that was a mistake on the previous person's end, since she showed me proof of emails that went on between everyone. \n\nI listened and acknowledged, and said \"I understand, but where does that leave me?\". Originally they offered me a .25 cent raise which would bring me to $14.25, which I quickly countered and explained, calmly, why that wasnt a fair compensation. \"I feel with my qualifications and my value of being the only fully certified employee at my location, I think a .25 cent raise would not be very fair to reflect my role.\" \n\nAfter 20 minutes, she realized I had never received my mandatory 90 day evaluation for a wage increase, never received raises for certain goals met, and other factors. I received a $1.50 raise to $15.50/hr, and I will be up for review again in April when my annual review comes up, where she said \"with everything you have done, the minimum you will see your wage go up is another $1.50. I would expect to be up to at least $18/hr when your eval is due, most likely more.\" I requested that in writing so I'd have it and she happily obliged!\n\nTL:DR - Was being paid less than entry level employees, negotiated professionally thanks to advice from the sub, received a raise with another one coming in two months.\n\nEDIT - forgot to mention, full back pay for the time worked :) Also edited our irrelevant company info \n\nEdit 2- Im going to acknowledge this because I've been seeing a lot of people saying its a low wage and I should leave. Ill admit, its not an ideal wage, however, the overall career benefit towards a HIGHER wage and career is well worth it. They pay for graduate school in full, which benefits me as it is a top university they are affiliated with for my career path. They offer a lot of benefits most companies similar to mine do not offer or offer at a high cost to the employee. Im well aware I could be making more, but something people on here forget sometimes is, life satisfaction. Im happy where I am, and yes the wage isn't perfect, but I love what I do and I wake up every day excited to work, not dread it. I do look at it as a paycheck, but I am not unhappy. \n\nEdit 3- didn't realize this would generate hate. Well I'll break down even more: whether HR is screwing me with this new wage is honestly whatever you guys think. In my opinion, they took care of me as best they could. This is a position that doesn't require a degree, and hopefully when I receive mine this May, it will go up more in pay. The takeaway from the post was supposed to be that I was able to get a higher wage by being professional and collected. Those of you saying to leave a job I'm happy at for money it baffles me. Yes, I was unhappy with my pay when I found out, Now that's fixed and I'm 100% happy again. It's a shame I have to explain that to Reddit, but seriously, being happy and making okay money is perfectly fine for me. Because this path and company will allow me to do both if I invest the time now. It's not about making a lot of money right away, it's about learning and perfecting your skills TO MAKE more money. I just get lucky enough to have both. ",

They don't like to take on losing cases because they don't profit, so they'll generally give a straight answer as to the odds of winning a case.\n\nAnd in most cases, once lawyers get involved, that is about when the employer's like \"ok fuck this shit I need to abide by the contract\" because legal action is generally more expensive that the savings from fucking over your employees.",

Also have scan of written contract attached and explained in this email. \n\nIf there's no progress, then email boss' boss with email forwarded explaining the contract with a scanned copy attached. \n\nI would CC HR instead of going straight to them only. HR may have a meeting with the boss and the boss' boss without the employee's presence and side of the story. ",

They are employees paid to manage other employees and protect the company if their is a problem so things go smoothly. They are bias and are not here to protect you at all. \n\nNever complain to HR about your Boss if he is head of the company. He can't be replaced and head of HR reports to him. \n\nI would be cautious when talking to HR, remember they are not your friends even if they may pretend they are. \nIf they give you something it is definitely because it was in the best interest of the company.\n\nOP example is cristal clear. \nMost likely he is not the only one being under paid, but it is better to pay someone and end things there than to let them talk to everyone and probably have to pay for 10-15 other employees. \nThey didn't forget he was underpaid, they exchanged emails about it. They just let it slide, see if anyone would say something.\n\nWorst enemy of HR are unions, attorneys and department of labor. \nI am not advising people to go heads on against HR, not a good thing at all. \nYou will get what you want from a court case, but it will become HR top priority to build a case against you. \nYou should talk to them but be careful on how you address things.

But then I got to my current job, was reviewed the first 3 years in a row, then the economic bubble burst and now reviews are basically dead. In the past 8 years we've had maybe 3 evaluations, 2 of which were automated and probably not reviewed by anyone. In most of those 8 years (probably 5-6 of them) corporate declared ahead of time that there would be no raises/CoL increases, and in the years that there were it was between 0-1% for most people.\n\nAlso like the OP we had people who were getting less than entry level people and in some cases an hourly wage less than most interns.",

That's a good sign that you're working for a good company.\n\nA lot of people could've been bitter about how everything went down, when in reality, it was just someone being an idiot, and then no one really knowing all that was going on, in terms of what you were doing and getting paid.

You had to fight just to get a moderately fair raise, and then are given the promise of a future raise to satiate you. I think you should definitely start looking for a new job as soon as possible because I get the feeling that the company will either fight as hard as possible not to give you another raise or just find reason to terminate you. Be wary. But good job fighting your fight so far. ",

When it came time to pay for school, I was told \"that's on you, but I'll cover books\". I didn't have the cash, so I waited until the next semester. At that point I asked for the tuition agreement in writing. I got it and immediately got the secretary to notarize it. This made the owner furious, I assume because he never planned to follow through. School still didn't work out at the time, but that's another story. Anyways, months later I asked for and was promised a raise. I asked for it in writing and the owner told me \"that's fine, but if you get it notarized I'm ripping it up.\" Within 3 weeks of that conversation I went from a \"mom and pop\" company of 15 employees to an international company making substantially more money.&lt;p&gt;\nTL DR; I worked for a dishonest employer.

I decided to ask them their wage, found out they were making more than me, which was weird, but I accepted it. The following year I recieved a promotion to a supervisor and an increase of $0.35 an hour which is fairly BS considering the extra hours I'd have to work and how everything everyone that I supervise does, ends up falling onto me being at fault. Fast forward a few weeks and one of my supervisee's told me his new rate of pay... $1.50 more than I made as his supervisor. He only had 3 months extra experience than me which made me feel cheated, spoke to my foreman ended up getting $0.50 more than him after several long talks. Fast forward a few more weeks, find out that someone who started several months after me, no specialized skills, known for being high at work etc, was being paid more than me still despite me being his direct supervisor. Quit, found a new job closer to home and am not regretting leaving it at all.",

In terms of the extra money you'll be getting, a great idea would be to set up a standing order to automatically save half of your extra money - 0.75 dollars per hour equivalent on your pay check and enjoy the rest. That way you'll still be getting a noticeable pay rise and yet also saving a good bit too. Do this with the back pay and any future bonuses too. Half for savings, half for you. Splurging everything is obviously a bad idea but so is saving everything as you don't get as much motivation due to the lack of perceived rewards.

I don't have time to read through all the responses so maybe someone's already said it, and sorry in advance for being a downer, but there is something you should be wary of; the vast majority of businesses are about their bottom line first, employee satisfaction second if at all.\n\nBy bucking for a raise and turning down their first offer and accepting a bigger one along with a written promise of another in the near future, you may have just in their minds given them a deadline to find a replacement for you. It isn't uncommon for a company to give in to demands for a raise and secretly start looking for a replacement and then fire you for a real or made up reason or just lay you off \"out of the blue\". That way they don't have to scramble to find a replacement while also trying to cover your absence, and whoever replaces you will most likely start at your old wage or lower.\n\nI don't know you or your company's situation so I'm not saying that's what's happening or even that it's likely, but you should be aware of the possibility and have a backup plan accordingly. At the very least start an emergency fund if you don't already have one and make sure there's enough in it to last you a few months, and update your cv and put it out there. Even if they aren't planning on getting rid of you, you might end up finding an even better job with all the extra experience and stuff you've gained at your current job.\n\nCongratulations and good luck!",

If you were to be paying for your own tuition, but in a higher paying company you might very well be in the same place financially that you are now.\n\nAnd you got them to back pay at your higher pay rate?? You won. ",

This due to the fact that I am 20 years younger than my other coworkers. I'm in middle-management btw. I was young and unexperienced.\n\nI had no college degree and my desire was to get a bachelor degree. The company I work at finances the tuition/book/etc... for me, I go to school 1 day in the week and I get paid that day in full as well. I have 1,5 year left and the I'm done with college. \n\n3 years later and my yearly wage has already increased by 10K (before taxes). Last week after my yearly evalutation my manager said that This is not the end yet and there are more opportunities to come. \n\nTrust your gut, you know what is right for you in the long haul! ",

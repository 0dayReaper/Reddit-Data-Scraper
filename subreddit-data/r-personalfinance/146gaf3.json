    "postText": "A few months ago, I purchased my first car from a small, family-owned dealership that I trusted to operate with integrity and honesty. Unfortunately, only a month after taking ownership of the vehicle, the engine check light appeared, prompting me to seek the advice of a mechanic. To my dismay, the mechanic informed me of a staggering $2500 repair cost, which my warranty did not cover. I was shocked and frustrated, and immediately contacted the dealership for assistance. However, they were unhelpful, blaming me for purchasing a \"lemon\" and dismissing my complaint. Adding to my troubles, the financing firm they worked with tricked me into accepting a sky-high 29.9% interest rate. Now, I'm at a loss as to what to do next. I don't want to resort to voluntary repossession as it could significantly harm my credit score. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",

Repo might be your best bet in this unfortunate situation. 30% interest is really really bad.",

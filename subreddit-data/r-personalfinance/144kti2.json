    "postText": "I got a capital one card with a $300 limit, I mostly wanted to get one just to build a credit score, but I\u2019m wondering if I use the card, how long do i have to pay it back? Is it a month? For example if I get groceries today (the 8th of June) with the card, do I have till the 8th of July to pay it back?",

That bill will have a due date that you have to pay it by (usually roughly 3 weeks or so from when the bill was issued) or else interest starts accruing.  Pay it at least before that date, and don't try to cut it too close lest something happens and you miss it and get charged interest.\n\nEach credit card company has their own monthly billing cycle, as to which date within the month that they pick to issue the next bill/statement.  Some companies allow you to pick that date.",

By US law you have at least 21 days to pay it.  \n____  \n  \nJust set up auto-pay.\n  \nGo to your account in the app, then click Set Up AutoPay, in Pay From choose your checking account from your bank (if you haven\u2019t already), and then it\u2019ll show the Due Date, in Amount choose Last Statement Balance (not Minimum Amount Due).  \n  \nI have mine setup but as a precaution, I typically go in probably once a week and manually make a payment to pay it all off.  \n  \nFYI, for a real good score you don\u2019t want to use up to your max credit limit ($300 for you), good is 30% used and only 10% is excellent. However at only $300 you may not be able to, which is fine, after a few months you\u2019ll likely get upgraded to a card with a higher limit (I did, $500 to $2000).",

            "comment": "Your card works on a monthly billing cycle.  You will have a closing date every month that is generally the same day every month.  It's set randomly, but you can ask them to change it if you want to.  Let's say, for sake of example, your card closes on the 20th.  Everything you buy between now and June 20th will be on the same statement which they will mail to you and post online on the 21st.  The statement will also have a due date.  This will be generally 21 days after the statement date.  So in this example July 10th.  So you would have until July 10th to pay for everything you bought between May 21 and June 20.\n\nThe most important thing is to make sure you pay off the entire statement balance before the due date to avoid getting charged interest.

    "postText": "I am unsure if this is a real concern or if I am just inexperienced in this field but I feel like the person my girlfriend is working with for her 403b is charging a lot in fees. \n\nFor context she is a teacher in upstate NY and contributes $300 of each paycheck into her 403b account. She decided to go with this investment agency that her father recommended but got hooked into by what she describes as a very strange guy. He talked a lot about his ocd and sneaker addiction when she first met him. \n\nBasically what I am concerned about is that from what I see on her quarterly statements, everytime she makes a contribution a 16-17 dollar fee is charged for management. I am unfamiliar with this because through my employer I can just select where my funds get invested online without using somebody else. I would like to look into this a little more to see if we could choose to elect where her funds are allocated without this third party because I feel like this is a lot of money to be spending for someone that does not really communicate at all with her. For context he left the original investment agency and took her file with him and the only reason she knows this is because she had to call him because the find she was investing in was being liquidated. \n\n\nMy question is: is this a lot of money to be paying in management fees for the service she is getting, or is this a reasonable amount and I shouldn't be worried.\n\nIf this is something that we could do on our own and avoid these fees I would be much happier but maybe we just need to find a new manager for her account. \n\nThank you for any advice.",

If you don\u2019t, fire them immediately. There are many others happy to take your money and you can always do it yourself.\n\nsource: personal finance nerd and currently interning in wealth management",

See if her plan offers multiple vendor options and review the fee structure in each.\n\nI would recommend she contribute only enough to get the match, then look at Roth IRA and HSA. Only go back to the 403b is she has maxed out the other tax advantaged accounts",

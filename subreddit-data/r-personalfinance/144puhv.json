    "postText": "Hello, I am in need of advice. I currently have $17,532.19 in CC debt. \n\nDiscover - $11,131.71 @ 24.74%\nUS Bank - $6,400.45 @ 0% (balance transfer  but that will end soon)\n\nI only make $43K/year (this is between 2 jobs). I try to pay what I can afford. I have been paying the minimum for the 0% card and try to pay a little extra towards the Discover card. The fees kill me but it\u2019s daunting to me. \n\nWhat advice can anyone give me? I want to pay this debt off fast but don\u2019t know if I should look into (1) debt consolidation, (2) take out a loan to pay off the majority of the CCs, (3) no plan C. Any help is helpful. \n\nThank you",

Refinancing and loan consolidation may not be available to you at this time.\n\nTry using either the Avalanche or the Snowball method to bring down your debt. There are YouTube videos that have extensive information on these two methods. Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors.",

Once that's clear, you can pay more than the monthly rates and close the loan faster than 5 years, so overall you won't pay that much interest. \n\nGet your spending under control ... maybe look for cheaper rent / housing even if it costs you more.  See if you can get a better job, look around.",

    "postText": "Hey! I\u2019ve decided to put an amount of cash in money market (need it within the next 12 months so not interested in investing it). Which money market should I do? I\u2019ve seen that Vanguard has a few money market funds with high yields and low expense ratios such as VMFXX and VUSXX. I use Fidelity for my investing. Can I put my money in the Vanguard market funds with the same yield and expense ratio at Fidelity or does Fidelity have any good substitutes?",

            "comment": "If you're with Fidelity, just buy SPAXX.  If you have a regular Fidelity brokerage account your core position is already SPAXX, meaning that any uninvested cash will be auto swept into SPAXX.  At Fidelity you won't be able to buy Vanguard money market funds.  SPAXX currently yield 4.75% versus ~5.05% for VMFXX/VUSXX.  If you have a large amount of cash you can buy FZDXX which yield 4.9%.  But I wouldn't sweat the difference unless you have a really large balance since the difference between 4.75% vs 5.05% on $10K is only $30/year.\n\nOr if you don't need access to your cash for 4 to 13 weeks, you can just buy 4 to 13 week Treasury Bills which are yield 5% plus.",

    "postText": "If the 72 month loan gives me a manageable monthly payment, is it okay to take on a longer loan if I plan to make additional quarterly payments of ~$2K?\n\nMy thought process is that the monthly payment is lower so the impact isn\u2019t as large, but whenever I receive additional income through commission, I can put that towards the principal of the loan.",

You will end up ahead of the 72 month loan this way.\n\nIf the quarterly bonuses are not guaranteed, it sounds like you're one missed bonus away from being in trouble on this loan, regardless of term.\n\n\nAnd if you can only make a car work on a 72 month term, you cant afford the car",

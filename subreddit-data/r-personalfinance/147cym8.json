    "postText": "I've been banking at WF forever. Trying to become more financially educated and realizing I should not be banking with them. Right now I have a savings account, checking account (with debit card), and a WF Visa Credit Card. \n\nRight now I'm considering a Fidelity Cash Management account for checking and an Ally Savings Account for my savings/EF. \n\nI think this would meet most of my needs, but I do have one specific that I need an additional solution for: I am in a band and often dealing with cash. I have to deposit cash 1-2 times a week from performances. Also, about 1/4 of the performances, I need to cash a check, deposit 1/5 of it for myself and pay out cash to the other 4 members.\n\nI don't think I'd be able to accomplish this with the Fidelity Cash Management account. \n\nIs the solution to bank with another local bank just for this specific need? How can I avoid fees doing that with a small account size and using it as needed? ",

That has money laundering risk written all over it",

Is there any additional security separating savings and checking banks? \n\nAny additional suggestions to my plan based off your additional comments? Thanks!",

You can buy spaxx at fidelity which is yielding 4.74%\n\n&gt;Is there any additional security separating savings and checking banks?\n\nNo\n\n&gt;Any additional suggestions to my plan based off your additional comments?\n\nThose cash deposits will likely become problematic anywhere without a business account",

If you look deep enough at any of them, you will find something. \n\nIf you need access to deposit cash, a local credit union would be a good idea. CUs don\u2019t treat you like a number (most of the time), and sometimes have higher rates. \n\nSavings accounts are a dime-a-dozen right now. Fidelity with SPAXX is great\u2026.right now. When interest rates decrease, so will SPAXX. HYSAs at Discover, Amex, Ally, SoFi, etc are all protected by FDIC so no worries about fund security. \n\nTo me it sounds like you need a basic checking account at a CU and a HYSA at a online bank.",

            "comment": "Betterment is an investing app, but it actually offers a no fee (at all) checking account that, I believe, has no minimums. It comes with a cash back debit card. They also have a high-yield savings account at 4.5% with no fees or minimums. Be aware the investment accounts do charge a fee. It is only online.\n\nMy mom uses Ally and likes it, but I don't know the details, other than the savings account APY is 4.0%. I do know they allow you to set out separate \"buckets\" in some accounts, which may be good for allocating money for each band member. Ally is also only online.\n\nMy sense is that online banks usually are the best for their terms. Still, read the fine print. \n\nI am going to reiterate someone else that adding and automatically moving out money is a red flag to a bank. Maybe try to work a few weeks or months ahead.",

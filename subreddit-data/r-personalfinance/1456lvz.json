    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI'm struggling to wrap my head around the idea that paying off a debt at a higher interest rate is better than saving/investing the money. I know it's common knowledge on this sub, but I'm not understanding the math behind it.\n\nIn my instance, I have a car loan I am hoping to pay off with a lump sum payment within the next month or two. There is a balance of $6,890 left on the car, at an interest rate of 5.34% with 35 monthly payments remaining. However, according to the math I've done and calculators I've looked at I would be able to save something like $550 in interest if I paid off the car within the next month. However, if I park $6,890 in my 4.3% SoFi account for 35 months, my earnings would be somewhere between $860-$940 before tax - so let's just assume the low end of $860 with a tax rate of 25% - earnings of $645. \n\nWhat am I missing here? Obviously there are other benefits to paying off the debt like a healthier debt-equity ratio &amp; more liquidity in our budget. Also, I realize I'm assuming the savings account would stay at 4.3% for nearly 3 years which is highly unlikely, but I just can't figure out the math! Is it more of a present-value of money issue?\n\nThanks!",

In my case I do plan on using that $215/mo to increase our emergency fund further, fund a full tune-up for the paid-off car to ensure it's in good shape for the next several years, &amp; then start saving it for a future car.",

Since one side of the equation considers only the lump sum, while the other side considers a lump sum plush cash flow.\n\nTo make an equivalent comparison, you'd need to only consider two lump sums or two lump sums plus cash flow.  You can't mix and match\n\n/u/xaradevir explained it better than I did",

I think overall it's a moot point because right now the $215/mo freed up is the biggest reason I'm paying the loan off. It'll go a long way to achieving other goals, so the interest involved is just icing on the cake.",

I was comparing the benefits of the lump sum payment at a single point in time to the benefits of a lump-sum investment over a period of time - which is not comparable. I needed to include the same variables in both sides of the equation to get the full answer and not ignore the opportunity costs.\n\nAlso, thanks for such a concise explanation. That makes it clear to me that even if I don't turn around and re-invest the $213/mo it is still a better option to pay the car off because it's an immediate \"return\" of $565, versus a net return of $125. Reinvesting the money would just be icing on the cake making it an even better decision.\n\nNow I just got to wait for the last few paychecks to come in this month to pull the trigger! It's the only debt my wife &amp; I have besides our mortgage. We'll have some subsidized student loans to pay once she wraps up college in a few years - but for now we'll be practically debt-free!",

    "postText": "College student here! I have some money saved up, equal to the amount of money or a bit less than it would cost to get a maters degree. I am currently getting a bachelors from UF, but it is a degree that doesn\u2019t have a great job outlook without further education. The problem is, I want to have a family around the age of 24 so I would likely not work after this. I would finish my masters at age 22 so I could make some money in those 2-3 years, but is it worth it or should I just keep the money I have saved and do something else with it and get a job that won\u2019t pay as well (as with a masters)?",

If your return to work phase is after several years absence from the workplace, a Masters may not matter so much - you will effectively be a entry level employee again.\n\nThis does not hold true if you are able to do part time work in your field during your family years.   That is what my wife did, and it worked reasonably well, but really did derail her career trajectory.  She was able to stay employed, but did find herself shuffled off to a less demanding job.  That was a bit of a bitter pill for her to swallow, but the kids and Iare grateful for her sacrifice for the good of the family.",

A part time job, or some evidence of keeping up with the state of the art in the industry would definitely help - taking additional/ refresher courses, reading industry journals and being conversant in the recent trends and issues, participation in professional organizations.  All of these would help for a brief absence, but if you are talking about a lengthy (years long) absence, then you will have challenges.  Frankly there will be new grads and early career people that are younger, cheaper, and more current in their skills.\n\nI am fully on board with you raising your kids - my wife\u2019s situation was pretty unique for the time as she was able to work one day a week in the office for several years.  I would WFH on that day and would actually do my work when she returned home.  A quick \u201ctag you\u2019re it\u201d and I would start work. I would then work through the evening and put in time on the weekend toco plate my work week.  It helped that we were both individual contributors and had a degree of autonomy regarding our work schedules.",

Get the masters.  You can always choose whether or not to use it later.  If you have the luxury of not working when you have kids the money you have saved now should be insignificant.  Get the masters.  Work part time to keep your skill set up and keep yourself from loosing your identity outside of being a home maker.",

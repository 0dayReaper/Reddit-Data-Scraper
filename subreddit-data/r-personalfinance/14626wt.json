    "postText": "I rented a hertz car for a few weeks and towards the end of the rental period i got into a collision with an object. The car got some notable cosmetic/ paint damage.\nI returned the rental but noone was there for me to talk and ask questions. A day later, i get the receipt and my deposit. I have not heard back from hertz since then.\n\nMy insurance is from my credit card. Should i file a claim? I'm worried that i might get called from hertz for damages after the timeline to file a claim is over. Any help or insights on what to do is really appreciated. TIA",

Either the claim will be processed, and they'll get it fixed without a cost to you. Or they'll respond past notice, your CC will close out the case, and if the rental guys try to get you to pay, you have proof that you started a case and they didn't respond. \n\nI think its the best way to handle it.",

But since you return the car they've inspected it and released your security deposit, I'm inclined to believe that they will not be pursuing it. Obviously I don't know that for certain.... However if it comes down to it, you have auto insurance, So at the end of the day you can just file a claim.",

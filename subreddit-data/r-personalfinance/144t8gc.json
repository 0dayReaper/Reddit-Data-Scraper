    "postText": "I need some guidance\n\nI have a 2014 mazda 3.  Its not the prettiest thing,  lots of oxidation. Between tires,  suspension,  and transmission I've spent 3000 on it in the past month. \n\nThis has prompted me to start car shopping since this amount is close to the value of the car itself and i fear more issues. I found a car i like and with financing I'm already approved for through a credit union, the payments are affordable below my current income. More on why i mention this later.. \n\nI played with trade in but of course they want to lowball me.  I was thinking i can move forward with selling for a bit more on the private market and put the profit towards the new car. \n\nHere's the kicker, i put in a what i call a floating resignation from my job last week. This means i gave them a 3 month period to find someone before i start applying. I then give a 30 day notice once ive found that position.  It took them a year to fill this position with me and there's at least 3 months of training due to the niche needs of my role.  I'm also highly experienced and can take more general roles in an area that has pretty consistent positions open in my field . \n\nWith all that being said, do you think it's crazy to get a new car at this point?",

Those are called \"wear items,\" and should not factor in to your decision-making on this. \n\nCars are expensive right now, and it appears that the Mazda is in fine working order. 132,000 is also pretty low nowadays. My 2008 Mazda 3 has about 155,000 on it right now, no signs of slowing down.",

    "postText": "i (24f) save my money very well, to the point i get ridiculed by my family how tight i am with my money. i eventually want to move out to my own place and buy a car, is why i don\u2019t spend much on anything. \n\nmy mom has always asked to borrow money from me. she lives her life how she pleases, but has accumulated debt. currently, she owes me a little less than 8k. it used to be more but i stopped giving her what i pay her for my rent and she takes that off what she owes me but she couldn\u2019t afford doing it, so now i\u2019m back to paying rent. she hasn\u2019t paid me back in any way and it\u2019s been many months, perhaps a year or two. \n\ni don\u2019t know why she can\u2019t even give me like $50/100 a week, but she won\u2019t. she prefers to pay back in larger amounts. \n\nshe just asked me to borrow 5k. apparently she owed her sister a lot of money and she was actively paying her pack in lump sums and it was stressing her out and it made her take out a legit loan just to pay everything she owes her. but now this loan she took out is stressing her out because interest. she needs the 5k to pay it all back, meaning she\u2019s digging a bigger hole with me.\n\nshe told me she\u2019s going to start paying me $500 biweekly and that i can even set up her account where it automatically takes it. \ni really really don\u2019t want to give it to her. i told her i didn\u2019t have it (i do) but i\u2019ll ask my boyfriend to pitch in, giving her more of reason to pay us back (i\u2019m not really going to ask him) \n\ni just feel like because i\u2019m her daughter, she is in no rush and i feel like this is the one chance to her paying everything back but it\u2019s gonna take like a year. she even said she\u2019ll cover my monthly bills (the house bills she put on me) and pay the remainder incase that\u2019s easier. \n\nshe probably manipulating me to get what she wants but i don\u2019t know, i just hate knowing the fact that she\u2019s the reason i\u2019m stuck here. \n\nis there a way to go about this where she gets the money she needs and so do i?\n\n\n\nedit: thank you all so much for the responses. it\u2019s refreshing to hear people be on my side when my reality is not like that. both of my parents see children as people who HAVE to take care of their parents, no matter what. since i\u2019m the eldest, they have engrained in me that they should be able to rely on me. i won\u2019t give her the money and i want to tell her i need her to start paying me back but i am nervous of her reaction because i will be telling her no and also for my money back. i called her out on how much she owes me already when she asked for the 5k initially and she said \u201creally? i\u2019m not going anywhere, i\u2019m not dying and you know where i live so you will get your money back.\u201d her and i never had a great relationship and she can be mean to me, evening threatening to take me off her life insurance and said i could be a better daughter to her since she was a fantastic one to her mom but i guess i\u2019m supposed to forget her insults when she\u2019s in need. maybe i should just forget what she owes me already and say no to her from this point on. thank you all again.",

And by afford to lose, I mean assume they'll never pay it back.  \n\nIf you can look at $5k, consider loaning it to your mom, and be okay if she never pays it back - then lend her the $5k.  \n\nI, personally, would lend my mom that money. **However**, (and this is huge) my mom is not the type to take advantage of people, especially not her kids. She actively opened accounts for my siblings and I when we were young that didn't have our fathers name on it because she knew he wouldn't hesitate to take it if needed. She has never once asked any of us for money. She literally paid us for helping them in place of needing to hire people (like general labor type of work during home improvement projects). I *know* I can trust my mother to only ever ask if they desperately need it, and I *know* if she ever has the means to she would pay it back.  \n\nLikewise, I have a friend I've lent money to numerous times, they have always paid it back without even having to ask, and they only ever ask when big unexpected expenses hit a little too hard or they're going through a temporary loss of work. If they need to again, I wouldn't hesitate to lend what I can.  \n\nRegardless, I still do the above with money I can afford to lose.  \n\nSo ask yourself, would you be okay if she never paid it back? If so, would it hurt your relationship with her and would that be enough to cause further problems down the road between you two?",

Consider what she owes you as a gift. You're never getting it back. Do NOT lend her more money and MOVE OUT ASAP. There's no reason do you to be sick somewhere waiting to live your life because your mom is financially irresponsible. Sorry, OP.",

Enabling allows someone to continue a behavior that ought to change.\n2. Money \"loaned\" to a relative should be viewed as a gift -- in other words, don't expect to be paid back.   Having an expectation of money loaned to a relative can lead to long-term resentment and permanent harm to the relationship.\n\nNot saying you shouldn't \"loan\" her the money, just be realistic about it.",

    "postText": "I've recently moved into a condo complex that I've now learned needs a lot of urgent work done. We haven't yet gotten a final figure, but it's looking like a $30k-$40k assessment may be in my near future.\n\nMy options:\n\n* **401(k) loan** \\- I haven't gotten confirmation on what the interest rate would be, but some research has suggested that it's the prime rate plus around 1%-2%, so about 6.25%-7.25%, up to 5 years\n* **Home Equity Loan** \\- The estimate I got from Discover was 11.74% for a $40k loan, up to 30 years\n* **Emergency Fund** \\- I still need to leave a cushion for other sudden changes like layoffs or similar, so I don't want to do too much from here\n\nI'm not considering a personal loan since my understanding is that that would very likely be a higher rate than the HELOAN.\n\nI'm inclined to think that the 401(k) is best since at least the \"interest\" is re-invested into my retirement savings. Though the monthly payment will be higher than the HELOAN, I could make it work. I can't really come up with a good justification for the Home Equity Loan in comparison since it'd cost me *so much* in interest.\n\nThe second question would be (and this is probably just a personal comfort level thing)...how many month's worth of expenses of my cash reserves should I throw at this? Right now, my Emergency Fund is 6 months of expenses assuming no unemployment benefits. Closer to 8 with unemployment.\n\nI guess the last question would be...am I missing anything? Any other options?",

If my cash starts to exceed 10k with no plans for spending, I start moving it to investments. Large expense, drain cash and pull LOC and then aggressively pay that off. 6-12 months of emergency funds just sitting earning nothing seems crazy to me.",

The other 25% is in an HYSA.\n\nI hadn't really considered a HELOC, but maybe that makes sense to cover the remainder after I throw cash at it, instead of the 401(k) loan.\n\nThat said, it still *costs* me more than the 401(k) in the long run, no? The interest rate of the HELOC will virtually always exceed the interest rate of the 401(k) loan (plus it's variable), not to mention the fact that I'm repaying myself with the 401(k) interest, rather than a bank. Even factoring in the growth of the 401(k), if we're only talking a 5 year repayment period, the incremental returns still wouldn't outpace the HELOC interest.\n\nUnless I'm missing something?",

What happens if the next one is scheduled for February '24 and you don't even know it?\n\nAssessments are the way to keep dues artificially low. Dues are typically used to set aside money for major repairs, but depending on the state, that can be waved, so dues are kept down and owners vote in sizable assessments for everything from weather damage, to parking lot repair, to siding repairs. \n\nMake sure you get and pore over the minutes, budget, and dues schedules. Have your real estate agent ask what assessments have been levied since say...2019. That information will give you a picture of the board's propensity to assess.  In most states, HOAs must provide you with this information, so be sure to ask.",

We are recovering from a hurricane, so it has been trial by fire. I am not sure where you are, but there are a lot of good books out there on self-managing condos by state. Make sure, if nothing else, that you familiarize yourself with the state condo laws that often supersede what is in your docs.\n\nI have found that owners want to push down monthly dues because it helps in resale. Too often, people just look at the dues without looking at  - or even knowing about special assessments. Good luck!",

Homeowners are given the choice of either paying the assessment at once OR paying it in installments monthly with the interest being passed through.\n\nTypically about 50% of the owners pay up front and 50% use the installment method. It is much easier for most homeowners to use the \"loan\" negotiated by our Board.",

The boards and HOAs vote on whether to assess or pursue loans to cover major expenses - and most repairs should be taken care of through reserves.  In fact, many states like Florida require HOAs to set aside that money in reserves for major cyclical repairs (roof, paint, parking lot, siding, etc.), which comes out of monthly dues. Condo loans have brutal terms, and most require equity from the owners - which means another assessment - so why assess AND pay the interest, fees, inspections, etc.\n\nBeware of condo associations that have no reserves, especially in states where they are required. HOAs that constantly waive them are being negligent.\n\nCondos in high risk weather areas (think hurricanes) would be ill-advised to finance assessments because they could pile up fast.",

Depends on your 401k plan as some don't require this, but most do. \n\nSorry this happened. I assume you didn't know about this before you bought the place? I'd make sure there was no hint that this was coming down the pipeline when the previous owner sold. If they know about this and didn't disclose it, it's probably worth pursuing restitution on the advice of your real estate agent.",

To be honest, the place is so good in every other way, it wouldn't have stopped me, I just would have planned finances differently.\n\nAs for the 401(k), I should have mentioned, it's a Solo 401(k) for which I have hired a plan administrator. So, I'm somewhat less concerned about that particular risk. I guess,  at some point in the next 5 years, if I somehow can't continue having it, I'd still have emergency savings to pay it off or at worst, I could do a home equity loan for the remainder?",

What's happening is, you take the present value of 40k out of your account, but it's equivalent to taking out the future value of say 60k out. And then you pay back that 60k. In the end, your 401k account is the same as if you'd left it. Similarly, with the bank, you take out 40k now, collateralized by your house, and then pay back 60k by the time of the future value. Except, the growth you miss out on from the 401k is compounded, so your 401k would actually have been maybe 65k. Hypothetical numbers but you see what I mean. \n\nI really don't recommend the 401k route, it's usually a last resort thing if you're super delinquent on some debt and are being charged a daily interest rate or the like.",

If those are in something like total market index funds, you may have to withdraw that money at a loss.\n\nIf you have an emergency fund, you shouldn't need to worry about those things.",

Currently, HYSA gives a 4% rate while (i only googled one result), money market accounts are giving 2-3%. \n\nObviously moving your IRA funds into other funds can lead to risk during market downturn and forces you to liquidate at a loss during an emergency.",

You can contribute to Roth into 2024.\n\nThe using Roth as an e-fund is suboptimal. You pull it out, you're not getting it back in for most situations.\n\ntl;dr Don't do it, build your e-fund and then Roth. Look at your expenses and live more frugally for a few months. It's worth it in the long term.",

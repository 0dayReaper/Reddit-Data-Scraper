    "postText": "Need a program to start tracking my finances so I can see where my money is going. Started doing some research and talking to some people. They use quicken deluxe which is the desktop oriented and not cloud based version. Seems like after doing some research people either love it or hate it but recommend it over simplifi. \n\nFinances are pretty basic; \nEach have our own credit cards \nMe and my spouse both have separate accounts with a joint account that we pay our shared bills out of. \n\nWith the deluxe can we track all the accounts or would we each need an account to track our separate accounts?\n\nI\u2019m leaning towards the deluxe but just looking for some opinions.",

That said, I've spent my career doing government financial management and know how to configure everything to my liking.\n\nQuicken can be a big beast and I imagine would be intimidating for people new to managing their finances. But if you're willing to put in the time to get everything done correctly it's the way to go for sure.",

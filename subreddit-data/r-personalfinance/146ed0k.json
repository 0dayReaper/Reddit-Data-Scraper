    "postText": "I've been dealing with a frustrating situation regarding a bill from the hospital(RWJ Jersey city medical center) that should be covered by my insurance (United healthcare Oxford). Unfortunately, the insurance company keeps rejecting the claim because the hospital didn't file it correctly the first time 'incorrect code'. Even when the hospital attempted to refile the claim, they rejected the claim and indicated that is should be filed as 'duplicate' claim. I've reached out to the insurance company for assistance, and they've assured me that I don't need to take any action as it's the hospital's responsibility. They promised to contact the hospital and resolve the issue. However, despite their assurances, the problem remains unresolved, and I continue to receive new bills from the hospital, every 30 days of speaking with the insurance company. This entire cycle has repeated 4 times now.  \nI've also made several calls to the hospital's billing department, but they insist that they are filing the claim correctly. To make matters worse, the most recent bill I received from the hospital warns that they will involve a collection agency if the payment is not made. This situation is causing me a great deal of anxiety, especially considering the bill amounts to $2,000. I'm extremely concerned about the potential impact on my credit score.  \nI'm at a loss as to what steps to take next to resolve this issue. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",

But we had UHC one year and they would \"misplace\" our premium payments to make it so our coverage canceled before a month with more medical expenses. They would ever retroactively cancel the policy going back 4 months. Happened 6 times for coverage I had for 10 months. One time I took my daughter to the doctor with a 103 degree fever and they told me I didn't have insurance because it was canceled without any notification.\n\nThe last time was a YEAR after I canceled the policy. After spending hours and hours of my life on the phone for each incident, I finally got the supervisor's supervisor on the phone. I gave them the dates for each payment and made them give me their confirmation # for each transaction. Then I asked them point blank, did I pay everything I was supposed to pay? They said yes. Then I made them mail me documentation of everything we just talked about.\n\nLo and behold it never happened again. Because I had the info under their letterhead and I told them I would immediately contact the state if anything happened again and would let the state handle it.\n\nHOWEVER, and this is how far UHC goes in their criminal behavior, I got a check from them 2 years after my coverage ended for like $72 claiming I overpaid. I tore the check up on the spot.\n\nNot a doubt in my mind that they would have suddenly marked a premium payment as being short and canceled my policy and requested refunds for all of our medical visits.\n\nUHC is a professional crime organization.\n\nUHC is the reason I am a socialist now.",

Insurance companies have safeguards in place so they don't end up paying the same exact claim twice. \n\nWhenever an insurance company denies a claim for coding reasons, get as much detail as you can about the code that's incorrect. Is it a CPT code or a DX code, or both? Is the place of service code wrong, indicating a different kind of facility and causing your benefits to be applied incorrectly? Is the error on one line item or multiple lines? Make sure they tell you what the codes are that were billed on the claim, some hospital billing offices don't give out DX codes, it just depends on their HIPAA policy. If the services were preventative in nature, are the diagnosis codes on the bill preventative or diagnostic? They can tell you this information.\n\nYou want to be able to point out to the hospital billing office exactly what needs to be reviewed and changed. So often patients call in asking for a review and all they can say is that their insurance company said it was coded wrong. That's really not enough information. Remember that the people in the billing office usually are not medical coders or even clinically trained.\n\nI work in medical billing so I'm familiar with this stuff.",

Contact the provider's billing office again, be firm, and repeat what the insurance company has told you. Reiterate that it is THEIR responsibility to fix this error and that aging/collections on the account should pause until the hospital gets their act together. Be firm. Escalate as much as possible. To cover yourself, I would also send their billing department a written letter certified mail with return receipt summarizing what's going on, demanding that they fix the issue immediately, and demanding that all collections notices/efforts cease until they send you a correct bill.\n\nDon't be intimidated or stressed. Again, it is very common for insurance companies and medical providers to make errors, point the finger elsewhere, and be pushy with payment. You don't budge until they fix THEIR issue. It is not your problem. Don't worry about collections. If you do receive a collections letter, you have rights under the FDCPA and can fight back. If you receive a collections letter, come back and I can give you advice on how to deal with that.",

I am little hesitant to ask as they haven't been particularly helpful in the past. It seems that arranging a three-way call is the most common suggestion, so I plan to give it a shot this coming Monday.",

A claim is rejected if the provider bills it with coding or billing errors that cause it to be unprocessable.\n\nHave you filed a grievance with your insurance company yet? Also, as someone else suggested, consider a three-way call with your provider and insurance company. The provider may not be doing their due diligence and finding out why the claim keeps rejecting.",

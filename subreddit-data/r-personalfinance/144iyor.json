    "postText": "Washington state, single tax payer. \n\nI was offered a gig that\u2019s 1099 base 800 a week, average is 1200, but you make much more than that. That\u2019s just what they say as an overall average. \n\nMy brother just started as well and he mentioned they bring in over 2k a week. They also told him they suggest taking out only 10% per paycheck and putting it in a savings until quarter. \n\nThey reimburse mileage up to 49c. They say you claim the other 14c, cell phone, tools ect as a write off. \n\nIm bringing in about the same per week on W2. Do you guys think it\u2019s worth making that switch?",

However, the gamble is it sounds like the pay could be better. How sure are you that you'll make at least 25% more than you do at your current job, for the same amount of work?",

I do believe so. \n\nI suppose you could make 25% more. Especially once you're trained. The faster you install the more you make kinda deal.",

However, you also have FICA, for 1099 you pay 15.3% but get a deduction of 1/2 (7.65%) so the net FICA for you is probably ~13.5%. So that\u2019s ~26.5% of your paycheck. The common advice is to save 25%-30% of each and put into a high-yield savings (sometimes even more depending on local/state tax and income level).",

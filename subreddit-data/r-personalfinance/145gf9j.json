    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI tried posting this on r/whatcarshouldIbuy but haven't gotten any replies.\r  \n\r  \nBasically, I have about $15 K that I could spend on a used Tacoma, but I can't decide if I should do that or get a used motorcycle for 4-6K.\r  \n\r  \nI have an '05 Toyota Solara in the shop now with 248,000 miles on it. I'm getting the ignition switch and power steering pump replaced and just had the front struts done.\r  \n\r  \nBasically, I'm wanting to move to a new city for other job opportunities and I want something more reliable that won't cause me to miss work and that I can also use for side jobs (I work in plumbing).\r  \n\r  \nMy concern with spending $15K on a Tacoma is how do I know it's been well-cared for? I have all the oil change records for my car and it might last another 100K, I just don't want to risk missing work at a new job because of it.\r  \n\r  \nI currently have a company van, but was given it arguably too early. When I switch companies, I likely won't have my own work van for 3-12 months or thereabouts.\r  \n\r  \nI couldn't do side jobs with a motorcycle, but it would be a more economical way to have a backup for getting to work if there were a problem with my Solara.\r  \n\r  \nWhatever I do, I'll be paying cash because I don't want any more hard inquiries on my credit, thus the reason for not financing a newer truck. I may need to pass a credit check for an apartment rental and have two hard inquiries fall off in December. If I got a motorcycle, I would end up buying a newer Tacoma once my Solara is beyond repair or Toyota stops making parts for it.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, is there a way to buy used trucks/cars with a verified service record? Is that what \"certified preowned\" means? I've never bought a used car before, so I appreciate any and all insights.\r  \n\r  \nThank you and have a great weekend!",

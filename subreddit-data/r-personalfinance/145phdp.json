    "postText": "I (30F) am just frustrated. I don\u2019t understand how to even begin to move forward and get ahead. Money is the worst!! \nI am at a big adult job now and make 65k which is the most I have ever made. It\u2019s awesome and I love my job it does keep me busy but overall it\u2019s great with good people. Every month I pay 3k to bills (rent, child care, utilities) this leaves me with $400-$500 every paycheck, which is the 15th and 30th of every month. I know it seems like a lot but it\u2019s not. \nI have a husband (41M) who is graveyard and doesn\u2019t make much but gets paid weekly maybe $450-$550 a week and a toddler (4M) who takes a lot of time and money obviously. Car payment is auto take out $288 and second one I try n pay $350 so we aren\u2019t paying $680 all at once. I\u2019ve had to take out a payday loan and it\u2019s been eating at me. Credit cards are maxed out for gas and food and it\u2019s hard to pay them and not use them. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m drowning. We barley have $15-$20 in our account after everything. I guess my question is, does it ever get better? What am I doing wrong to have it so near death every month? What in the world can I do to do better? \n\nI was thinking of a second job but then I would never be with my kid or even sleep. I feel so torn I think I just need some personal advice on how to make it work. \n\nThanks \ud83d\ude0a",

Sure, it's needed some repairs, now has rust, 150k miles, has some other quirks...but the monthly cost of ownership averaged out to today is below $120/month. That's about $400-500/month less than the average car payment and continues to drop as I plan to drive it into the ground. That's a savings of roughly $32,400 assuming one made average payments for 6 years/72 months. Wild. \n\nPeople with car payments over $400 making less than 80-90k/year are going to regret that around the time they wish they were retired.",

I explained that the lease on my previous vehicle had run out and I didn't have the funds to buy or lease a new vehicle....nor did I have the time to search for a used one. So I'd started taking the bus to work, which dropped me off several blocks away in a neighborhood of boarded up, crumbling houses. (And there I am, walking in my business clothing; I might've well had a target on my back.) Anyway, his parents were looking to sell an ancient Ford pick-up truck (it was a 1970-something model) for $300 so I bought it. No air conditioning, only an AM radio, but it drove just fine and lasted me a few years until I got a better job and was able to afford something nicer. Best part of the story is that my boss had just recently bought a Jaguar, and with his usual sensitivity parked it out in the lot the first day (instead of his private garage), apparently hoping everyone would ooh and aah over it. Instead, that was also the first day I drove the Ford pick-up to work, and guys from the plant as well as the office surrounded it, asked me about how many miles it had and were kicking tires and marveling at it. This being Michigan, many of them had cottages or land \"Up North\" and needed a cheap but dependable truck. Everyone completely ignored the Jag parked nearby.",

These are heavy things weighing on you. Two things: it\u2019s ok to feel overwhelmed by all of this, but you can get through it. Yes, it\u2019s a lot, but you can\u2019t solve all of it at once. What you can do is start to break down piece by piece what\u2019s going on, so you can understand it, and then start to tackle it. \n\nAs others have said here, we need hard numbers. Break down your costs per month, and list them here. Tell us about these car loans, how much is left on them, the rates. Tell us about this payday loan. Tell us what you pay for daycare. Look at your last month bank statements and credit cards, and figure out where every cent has gone the last month. Tell us about every cent of income, and money going out. \n\nYes, it\u2019s hard to write it all down. But right now, so much of it is it in the ether. Writing these numbers down makes them real, and then actionable. \n\nWe can help more when we see these things. \n\nLet\u2019s talk about husband. You note he has some disabilities, can you tell us more about the kind of work he does now? What kind of work could he do? There are limits, sure, and none of this is a judgement. We are just trying to see if there are blind spots you might be missing because everything is so overwhelming. \n\nYou can do this. There are answers. Step one is to get organized about where you are now. Let\u2019s do some of that and this sun can better help you find simulations one at a time.",

A full list of each and every expense needs to be tracked. Deep dive and find out where exactly all your money goes. Then find where you can save. Based on what you both make you absolutely can afford to pay your bills and save a little. Things will be tight and unexpected emergency expenses will hurt, but you can live off it and eventually get ahead. But it will take a lot of focus, diligence, and commitment.

            "comment": "So, if I'm parsing this correctly after taxes between you and your husband you are bringing in \n$3600 you and $1800-2200 him\n\nFor a total of about $5600\n\nThen you have rent $1700\n\nUtilities $300 give or take\n\nChildcare $1000\n\nCar #1 $680\n\nCar #2 $560\n\nYou dont list phone, credit card, monthly food, insurance, and a lot of other stuff that is on these kinds of things, hell im guessing at your rent because you just lumped together rent, childcare and utilities. I found your childcare actual cost in the comments somewhere. Looking at all of this Im initially concerned about your ability to just write a budget. And that makes me even more concerned for incidental spending. Like Im not really sure that you properly budgeted for your big expensive cars. Because the payment is only one part of the equation, insurance, gas, maintenance all come into play here. You didn't list dailies like a coffee or a soda, or eating lunch out at work. Perhaps you dont do any of this, but if you do is it in the budget. You don't have extraneous mentioned. \n\nThis is what my monthly budget looks like. I dont have any kids or spouses or any of that so Im quite a bit more in a do whatever the hell I want lifestyle than you. \n\nIncome after taxes, 401k and 10% to the investment account $4486.50\n\nMortgage $1135.17\n\nCar loan and insurance $1106.29 (Bite me, I like my big, expensive, fast cars, and this is what I choose to spend most of my me money on)\n\nFeul $140\n\nCar fund $100 (This is for annual or intermittent expenses like tires, maintenance, fuzzy dice, whathaveyou) \n\nUtilities $190\n\nPhone $87.11\n\nFood (grocery) $350\n\nFood (breakfast) $222.90 I know I eat at the cafe on the way to work every morning, so it gets its own budget place.\n\nFood (incidental) $250\n\nEntertainment $250\n\nCredit Card $150\n\nCash for spending $400 \n\nI chuck the remaing into the ole emergency fund.\n\nReally lay your budget out. Go online and get your full transaction activity for several months and then divide it up. See what you spend where and really look at it. Something I found helpful was just pulling $200 cash out of every paycheck and when that's gone, Im done buying shit, it kinda sucked at first but getting that into your head as your spending money and having it cash so that you can watch it disappear is way different than just handing over plastic. \n\nAnother thing you are going to want to do if you want to keep buying cars that are over the standard budget for your income is research cost of ownership on a car you are looking at buying. Because car price is more than just the payment.",

To summarize:\n- your cars are out of your price range\n- if you need two cars because of your husbands job, then it\u2019s likely that between the car payment and childcare, your husbands job is costing you money\n- someone mentioned your husband should serve tables part time and take care of the child during the day. This is what my wife does. She works about 18 hours(3 nights) per week and makes at least $600 per week, cash. We don\u2019t pay for child care and she contributes a large amount to our monthly budget.",

The average monthly car payment for used cars is $526 in the U.S. I don't know how people do that but I digress.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is immediately pay off the payday loan because the interest on that is going to tower over anything else you have guaranteed. They are designed to keep you paying, defaulting, and needing to take them.\n\nThe second thing you need to to is cut out every single unnecessary you purchase in a month. Every Spotify, Netflix, Disney+, no fast food, no red bull, no snacks, When you buy groceries don't buy expensive cuts of meat, buy easy cheap meals that you can stretch out. Literally pinch pennies in any way you can.\n\nThis will be terribly boring and will be difficult take the extra money, roll it into paying something off. Paying straight to principle and paying off one debt will give you that breathing room but use that to roll over into the next. \n\nI'm the only on that works. $77k a year job, $2,800 a month mortgage, $600 a month child support, but I did this to pay off 2 cars, a CC, all I have is a house payment besides regular bills. I also contribute 6% to my 401k, put $10 a week into a high yield account for my 1y/o and invest $50 bi weekly into stocks myself.\n\nIt's easy to fall behind and seems impossible to dig yourself out but if you keep at it and have a partner that sticks it out with you you can do it!",

I think a lot of people overlook cell phone costs including financing new devices for years. Skip the next new phone. Take your existing phone onto a prepaid plan set on auto-pay and if you need more data than that $50 / month plan provides, you can lean in on wifi when you are at home. \n\nNext time lease comes up take a serious look at if you can shave some money off here especially if you will be renting longer than 2-3 years. It might be well worth a move to something more affordable to save a couple hundred a month over 5+ years.\n\nYou will get there, the fact that you are looking for ideas is a great sign of what's ahead for your family.",

Things are going to get easier once you're no longer paying for full time day care, which is what that \"preschool\" is. This truly doesn't seem like an income issue though, it's money management.

You\u2019re looking for something to do that doesn\u2019t alter your current lifestyle. \nGood news, you\u2019re not alone and a ton of people operate this way.

They have to be constantly tended to, like a second child. They are a lot of work until you establish a habit and it\u2019s a hard one to get into.\n\nYou need to use some of the resources available around financial literacy. Read Ramsey, check out YNAB, look at Mint. Focus on your spending. Look at what you can cut. For us, dinners out or daily trips to the shop were killers. We had to find a way to avoid those things. My solution was a dry erase calendar that I planned 2-week of meals at a time on. Even the dinners out. I recommend a vis-\u00e0-vis marker so you don\u2019t accidentally erase.\n\nIt will get better, there are options and solutions.

Lots of people do, so don't feel too bad, but it can't go on, right?\n\nSo having a child is expensive. It's best to think of a child like a second house, because they cost similarly. To pay for a child on credit is way more expensive than a house though, because the interest on unsecured credit is terrible. Would you pay for a second house on a credit card? Hells no! That would be the fast route to madness and bankruptcy. Same thing with a child.\n\nYou now, as a family, need to cut back to the bone with your budget (and you do need a very strict, itemised budget) until you clear all that unsecured debt.\n\nYou also need to stop borrowing to have a nicer car. Secured credit it might be, but those car guys still charge a mint for it. Car credit doesn't compare well to other forms of secured credit, like mortgages. Get a cheap 2nd hand car if you must have one (and only one family car, of course).\n\nAlways ask yourself, if you feel you can't afford a thing, then how can you say you can afford it if you add interest on top? That only works if you have very uneven income so you have to spread the cost because you know the big cheque is coming in a couple of months. You guys have pretty regular income, so this isn't a thing for you.\n\nThe only credit you should be paying for is a mortgage.\n\nYou could address this by earning more instead, but personally I feel that working yourselves to the bone to pay the bonuses for the credit-mongers is a life I'd rather nope out of. Your choice, of course, but it wouldn't seem an attractive choice to me.",

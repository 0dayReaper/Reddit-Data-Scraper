The car loan is about a 6.5% rate for 72 months with a monthly payment of 315 dollars. I have zero contributions into my IRA this year as I am student and only put money in at various times when I have it. Thanks for any advice.",

There isn't any gain, there is just money not spent. That is very different buying a share of VTI holding it for 72 months and getting a 6.5% annualized return. The gain would have been this guy buying a cheaper car and fully funding a Roth IRA instead.",

Modern cars not so much. \n\nIf it was a mortgage, absolutely because that's just money you've put away for later when you sell. \n\nThat car likely isn't worth the total loan anymore and so paying it down only steals from you if that car gets totalled tomorrow since car insurance tends to only pay off the remaining balance of your loan OR buys an **equivelant car. If you pay down your house and it gets leveled tomorrow, you likely have insurance that will cover the cost of construction for an equivelant house. \n\nAppreciating assets\n\nUnsecured debt (CCs, unsecured loans, unsecured LoC, etc..)\n\nInvestments (can be switched with savings)\n\nSavings\n\nDepreciating \"assets\" (liabilities)\n\nIn that order because your appreciating assets like a house are effectively a savings account in physical form. Unsecured debts are compared against your income any time you look for credit/loans. Investments and savings because that's money that can make you money on the side through interest or appreciation (be careful with the Investments though and seek financial guidance on which stocks to acquire). Depreciating assets last because they are usually secured in the sense that the bank owns the financial obligations to those and thus will seek restitution from insurance assuming its not your fault they were written off. \n\nThis is my experience and your mileage may vary. Consult a financial advisor for a clear plan for you.\n\nEdit: formatting",

My loan on my current vehicle was like this; I made double payments most months but sometimes I'd forget to make a payment because I was so far ahead it didn't matter.",

Paying down the loan principal *guarantees* that the value of today's dollars is not decreased 6.5% per year by accruing interest. Contributing to the IRA *potentially* increases the value of today's dollars by however much the investment grows. I would not be certain that I could beat 6.5% by a significant amount over that time frame so paying down the debt is more appealing to me.",

[If you live in NYC, you'd pay 3-4%](https://propertyclub.nyc/article/new-york-city-income-tax) on top of your NY state tax, so you could make a high 5-fig or low 6-fig salary in NYC and pay something like 10% state and local tax. [California tax brackets are &gt;9% for relatively typical household incomes](https://www.tax-rates.org/california/income-tax).\n\nSo 12% may be a _little_ high for people in this sub, but it's not _that_ far off since ~10% may be a reasonable state + local income tax rate.",

Just as we'd generally recommend low-fee broad index fund investing over paying down a 3% loan based on historical returns.\n\nBut for most people, being able to consistently beat 6.5% by a notable amount and especially doubling that, that's not reality.  And we should be careful of encouraging joe blow to try to beat 6.5% through the type of investing you're talking about.  Not that you did that exactly.  And yes, fundamentally, if you can beat opportunity 1 by 6% with opportunity 2, then you should go with opportunity 2.  But for most of the world, opportunity 2 in this scenario isn't realistically achievable.  And it's so much not a reality that people should tread very carefully in speaking as if it's remotely normal/easy to accomplish.",

It\u2019ll grow a ton by the time you retire.  4% over 30 years is way more money than 6.5% over a fixed-length loan period - although paying it off earlier is still a good option.\n\nIf you\u2019re in your 30\u2019s, I\u2019d still probably recommend the same thing, because 6.5% isn\u2019t so bad - if it were much higher, this is the area where my math would start to change.\n\n40\u2019s\u2026. It\u2019s a harder call. Maybe split it and go half and half.\n\n50\u2019s or older, pay off the car.

The increased per-paycheck costs should be worth it when faced with significant health care expenses.\n\nYou may also end up meeting your deductible or out-of-pocket maximum, at which point everything else may be covered at 100%.  That may also be a good time to incur other medical expenses.",

You can save the bills and currently there is no time limit to submit for reimbursement, even if years down the road. \n\nKeep your HSA and use it as another type of retirement account.\n\nIf you don't have the money to not pull from your HSA then do so.",

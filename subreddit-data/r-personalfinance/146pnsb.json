    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI am here seeking professional guidance and advice regarding my current mortgage situation and the possibility of securing a new mortgage for a larger home.\n\nI am 31 years old and currently have one child, with another one on the way. Both my partner and I have full-time jobs, and fortunately, my job allows me to work remotely from anywhere in the United Kingdom. I acknowledge that the choices I have made in life, particularly regarding having children, are entirely my own, and it is my responsibility to care for them.\n\nUnfortunately, moving in with family is not an option for us as we do not have any relatives available for that. Additionally, my partner is expecting to receive a significant inheritance from the sale of her late father's property, which is expected to occur between 2026 and 2027. Her father tragically passed away from the coronavirus in 2019.\n\nAllow me to provide you with an overview of my circumstances. On May 31, 2024, I am scheduled to refinance my one-bedroom apartment, which is currently categorized as \"Residential.\" My goal is to switch the mortgage to a \"Let-To-Buy\" arrangement, as I intend to increase the value of the property to approximately \u00a3235,000, thereby gaining an estimated equity of \u00a369,000 or more.\n\nThe existing mortgage on the property amounts to \u00a3171,975, with a loan term of 35 years and a fixed interest rate of 1.67% for the initial two years. The property lease is valid for 125 years. To secure the property, I made a deposit of \u00a316,840.20, which accounted for 10% of the total value. Additionally, I have \u00a39,871.53 in my Help To Buy ISA and \u00a37,614.47 in available cash. I also received a Help to Buy ISA Government Bonus of \u00a32,475.14, which is 25% of the total contribution of \u00a39,900.54.\n\nBack in 2019, the property was appraised at \u00a3210,000. However, utilizing the Help To Buy ISA and the Right To Buy scheme, I managed to purchase the property for \u00a3189,461, receiving a government discount of \u00a320,539.\n\nGiven that my family has expanded and our current one-bedroom flat no longer suits our needs, it is essential for us to find a new home with a minimum of three to four bedrooms to provide adequate accommodation. Although I am open to the possibility of relocating, my preference is to stay within a 60-100 mile radius of London/Essex, as it would be more convenient for us.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that my partner's income, along with mine, is paid into a single bank account. This can be changed at anytime if required of course. The only reason we did this for the past 6 months was we found it easier to save more this way. My current cash savings amounts to \u00a340,000. When considering both our incomes, the total comes to \u00a340,000 x 5 + \u00a325,000 x 5 = \u00a3325,000 + \u00a340,000 = \u00a3365,000. \n\nHowever, due to a discount clause, I am unable to sell the one-bedroom flat for the next three years without repaying the initial discount I received on the property's purchase price.\n\nConsidering these circumstances, I am seeking expert advice and recommendations on the best steps to take moving forward. I would greatly appreciate your expertise in helping me find the most suitable mortgage options that align with my goals and financial capacity.\n\nPlease review and provide your insights and advice, as I am eager to explore the various opinions and guidance available online. Ultimately, my objective is to acquire a new home for my family.",

    "postText": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/irs-ruling-allows-401k-student-loan-benefits-2018-08-27\n\nThe IRS is setting up a framework for companies to match their employees' student loan repayments in the same way companies match 401k contributions. This will be cost neutral for the employer (edit: as in, it would not be more or less expensive for the company than traditional matching).\n\nEdit: the employer's match would go into the employee's 401k account.\n\nAccording to the article, employees with student loan debt accumulate 50% less wealth in their retirement plans (by age 30) than their peers without student loan debt. I think most of us with student debt have at one point or another felt \"behind\".\n\nThoughts? This is definitely a cool idea and would be a great hiring incentive/perk.\n\nEdit 2: due to the popularity of this post, I wanted to remind everyone of some of the rules on our sub.\n\n&gt;We don't allow:\n \u2022 Moralizing issues\n \u2022 Petitions\n \u2022 Political discussions\n \u2022 Political baiting\n \u2022 Soapboxing\n\nThis is meant to be a discussion of personal finance, debt, and retirement savings, not a meta review of the pros and cons of capitalism. Please keep things on topic.\n\n\nEdit 3: Since a lot of people are confused, I'll explain how a 401k match works. A 401k is a retirement savings plan that came into popularity as pensions fell out of the mainstream. The 401k is a tax-efficient vehicle to invest your money for retirement. Like the pension, employers can contribite to their employees' 401k plans as a benefit. This is usually done via a matching mechanism: I contribute 4% of my paycheck, and my employer matches that amount. Matches are almost always capped.\n\nWith the method laid out in the article, you would be able to make qualified student loan payments and have your company match that amount as a contribution to your 401k, up to a certain amount. So say you make $2000 per month, your employer matches 5% of your 401k contributions, and your monthly minimum loan payment is $1000 (in this example, you have a lot of debt). You aren't contributing to your 401k currently. If your company chose to take advantage of this program, they would put $100 ($2000*0.05 match) in your 401k each month you made a payment on your student loan.\n\nThis doesn't \"hurt\" people without loans. This is only subsidized by the government insofaras the 401k is tax-sheltered (you still pay taxes on that money), and this doesn't constitute your company paying your loans. Participation isn't compulsory.",

            "comment": "Well that sounds fascinating!\n\nJust to make it clear for anyone who may have been confused as I was when reading the post before the article, the matching contribution from the employer would go into the employee's 401(k) and not go towards repaying the student loan. In that way whether the employee chooses to put money away towards their retirement in the 401(k) or to pay down their student loans, it is simply treated equivalently in giving 401(k) matching contributions from the employer.\n\nI look forward to seeing if employers start to adopt this!",

In practice though I imagine most student loan payments are high enough that a 3 or 4% match will easily be reached by student loans alone.",

Usually these programs are something like they will match your contributions up to 3% of your annual salary, or something similar. So say you make $50,000 and have a 3% employer match. Under a traditional 401(k) match, that means that if you contribute $1,500 to your 401(k), your employer would also contribute $1,500, but only up to that point. This program would work the exact same way, just allowing your employer to consider your student loan payment as the contribution that they are matching. It means that if you're unable to afford contributing to both your student loans and 401(k), you can still at least benefit from your employer matching program to get some value in your retirement account.",

The size of the 401k program (measured by total dollars in the program) dictates what funds are available to the plan and what fees the employer pays to have the plan managed. \n\nSo if your employer has it's  401k with Fidelity and they have less than $1,000,000 in the plan they may only get access to a handful of funds and have to a larger amount to Fidelity to administer the plan vs if they had over $1,000,000 in the plan. \n\nAs you can see this incentivizes the employer to get you to contribute to the plan instead of paying down your loans. I think big companies will likely end up offering it because if you've got several thousand employees the student loans aren't adding up to a whole lot comparatively but if it's a smaller business with less than 100 employees then those fees and fund choices are directly impacting the senior execs investments.",

Now, they can go tackle at least high-interest student loan debt first while still enjoying all the benefits of matching.",

Income taxes are applied to the amount withdrawn early as well as a 10% penalty. You can see the only exceptions to this [here](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-tax-on-early-distributions).\n\n&gt;Can the employer's contributions be pre-tax for certain types of 401(k) plans?\n\nEmployer's contributions are always pre-tax. Even if you contribute to a Roth 401(k), the employer would still put their match into a pre-tax account.\n\n&gt;Would employers also be able to pay into a personal account that takes the place of a 401(k)\n\nNo.\n\nAlso, the linked article in the OP shows a plan an employer can *offer* but does not require them to do so.",

The pool of applicants they try to refinance is much larger and they are selling extended repayment terms to lower monthly payments for people with interest rates that are no better. \n\nA lot of people are paying more money. \n",

Either way, though, my point still stands: underwriting a refinance of a 23-year-old young professional's debt involves way less uncertainty than underwriting a 18-year-old who is trying to borrow money to attend college. Each borrower can be evaluated based on a much more complete risk profile, instead of trying to guess at the aggregate average for all borrowers.",

I still contributed to my 401k with a 5% match. Of course that $300 was taxable but it was essentially free money. I think continued education about student loan debt, borrowing responsibly for school, and encouraging students to consider careers that don't necessarily require a college degree are still needed to decrease the amount of debt that students have. The careers paths that would probably benefit the most from this (teachers, non-profit, public sector jobs, etc.) are the ones that probably wouldn't offer this benefit.",

The part that should resonate is this:\n\n&gt; A recent study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College found that, while student debt does not discourage 401(k) participation,\u00a0college graduates with student debt accumulate 50% less retirement wealth\u00a0in their 401(k) by age 30 than those without. This new option should increase 401(k) balances for this group.\n\n\nAs a graduate drowning in student debt, I would see this as accurate. Considering I'm 24 now, I don't see myself fully paid off by the time I'm 30 at my current job path. I'll be close but not all the way there. \n\n\nWith an option like this, I can pay off my loans sooner and explore more savings options for retirement rather than dumping all that I earn into a loan for a degree I earned years ago. Because right now I dont feel very incentivized to save as my college debt seems like a priority",

Under this I could pay down my loans while still getting the full match deposited in the 401k.\n\nRight now if I want my full 4.5% company match I need to put 6% of my pretax income into my 401k. If my company adopts this I could put 6% of my pretax income twoards my student loans and still have the full 4.5% \"match\" deposited into my 401k.\n",

I agree it's not like, _groundbreaking_, but it certainly could be helpful for many graduates.\n\nAgain: by age 30, workers with student loans have 50% less money in their 401k. This could help level the field, at no one's expense, basically.",

I\u2019ve had a well paying job since the day I graduated college and have been paying off my loans and paying into my 403(b) since the day I started work. I haven\u2019t saved a penny because of it. I\u2019ve been paying 2x the minimum on my highest interest loan, the minimum plus $70 on the other loan, and 15% into my 403(b). At the end of each month I\u2019m barely scraping even or maybe saving &lt;$100. \n\nI am honest with myself that some of this is due to lifestyle creep and not being as frugal as I should be, but if I had been part of a program like this since day 1 I would probably have 10s of thousands in my savings right now while still paying down my loans and saving for retirement. \n\nThis is a serious step in the right direction and I hope employers take advantage of this. \n\nP.s. any advice on how not to feel poor because of student loans and attempting to save for retirement while also building a life would be greatly appreciated (kind of sarcastic...but if you\u2019ve got advice I\u2019m all ears)",

    "postText": "So I keep going back and forth between a credit union conventional and a SONYMA loan. 5% down either way. Conventional has PMI up to 10% equity at around 6.25% interest. SONYMA has PMI up to 20% equity but has a 5.375% interest rate. I'm having trouble finding a calculator that will help compare these two. My question is, what's the better option long term? Thanks in advance!",

Go with the lower interest rate/lower payment and the long term doesn't matter if you don't plan on staying in the house for the length of the loan.",

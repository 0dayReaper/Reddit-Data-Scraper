    "postText": "I've searched far and wide for advice on this, but tech support and help for end-users with Plaid are hard to come by... so I come to you desperate.\n\nTwo weeks ago after some scheduled maintenance at Plaid, my bank account will no longer work with Plaid.  This is a much bigger issue than I first thought as it seems I use several very important 3rd party services and applications (financial software, exchange platforms, etc) that leverage Plaid.  All of those have come to a total halt for me and it is disrupting my ability to handle my finances properly.\n\nI've spoken to multiple tech support people at all of these 3rd parties and they all say that everything with my account looks fine on their end, but that Plaid is where the problem lies.  I submitted a ticket to Plaid days ago, but that has gone no where and it feels like I'm yelling into a black hole as Plaid only seems to want to deal with enterprise customers and not end-users.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this problem? I'm going crazy over here.  My last resort is to nuke my bank account and start over with another institution, but I really don't want to do that.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nEdit: Update for you wonderful folks.  I called my bank (Navy Federal Credit Union) again and this time they were more forthcoming with information about the nature of the problem.  Apparently it's a security conflict between NFCU's standards and Plaid.  Basically NFCU has a security expectation that Plaid is not willing to work around, and so NFCU Plaid customers are up shit creek until Plaid decides to make the necessary changes (NFCU will not budge).  The suggested temporary workaround was to \"log in and out of my account via using multiple IPs and hardware/devices until I trigger the security challenge\" and after successfully passing that security challenge my service with Plaid would return to normal.  Sadly I just did that and it did not solve the problem.",

Sounds like the choices are to either find another way of doing things that doesn\u2019t require plaid or change to a bank that plaid can actually work with.",

Plaid develops integrations for every bank, then offers it as a service to developers.\n\nMost banks don't care about giving data access to third parties, so Plaid has to work around all sorts of limitations. For example, you  usually have to give Plaid your bank account password and security codes so it can log in on your behalf. Which means you have to trust Plaid to not leak all your banking passwords.",

I have 2 accounts that link with my bank via plaid - about every 3 days I'll get a notice my account can't be reached and to sign in and verify. I do, and plaid will keep telling me I need to sign in to my online banking to acknowledge XYZ, or that there was \"an issue\" and just kick me out. I have accounts at 2 different banks, and plaid does the same routine with both - links fine for a few days then out of the blue drops for no known reason and won't re-link for days at a time.",

My monthly payments are $360.\n\nAm i not mathing right because 360*48 is $17,280, but 27% of $10,000 should be about $2,700-$3,000. So why am I paying almost twice the amount of the car itself?",

The next month, you are charged 1/12 of 27% on the amount of the loan that remains after last month\u2019s payment. Each month, the amount of the loan remaining is (slightly) smaller and the interest charged is (slightly) less. That\u2019s why the difference between 17K and the 20K u/Hugh_Mungo calculated. \n\nYou can pop your loan terms into an amortization calculator like this one to see how it works. \nhttps://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/amortization-calculator/",

    "postText": "I work amazon flex.  I didn't pay taxes last year, so I do not have to do quarterly estimates, and plan on paying a lump sum in April.  I just want to make sure I generally understand the situation I am in so that I don't get caught off guard.\n\nFEDERAL:\n\n-I will pay 12% taxes on all my income(minus deductions), because it is less than $44,000 or whatever the next jump to ~22% is.  \n\n-I get $12,000 written off, off the bat for single person standard deduction?\n\n-Beyond that, I can write off $0.0665 per mile, which combined with the $12,000 single person deduction write off should eliminate my income tax bill entirely.\n\n-Beyond that, I can write off my used Car purchase($8500, can I use this next year maybe, or do I have to use it same year I bought it?), although I shouldn't even need it, because everything will be written off by mileage and single person standard deduction.\n\n-SS and Medicaid taxes @ rate of 15.3%(which is double because my employer doesn't match me), are only based on profits.  Therefore, the amount that is taxable will be equal to my Revenue minus $0.065 per mile traveled?  Are there any other write offs for Medicaid/SS taxes?  The standard deduction doesn't apply to this right?\n\nSTATE of NJ Taxes:\n\nThe taxrate for income in NJ is only 1.3% up to $20,000, and I'll be below $20,000.  And it is only on profits, so once again the taxable amount will be Revenue- $0.065 per mile(once again, is there any other write-off I should be using beyond the $0.065 per mile?).  The standard deduction doesn't apply to this right?\n\nIf there is anything I got wrong, or am leaving out, or am misunderstanding, please advise.  I won't be filing for like 9 months, but I want to make sure I have a general grasp of what lays ahead, so that I am not surprised, and can live without fear.  I'd really rather not do quarterly estimates, as I don't like the idea of giving the IRS free money to get interest on, when I could be using it.  I am fine with just saving up more than enough money before April so I can pay in lump sum... I just need to make sure I understand APPROXIMATELY what that will be(then I'll save extra just in case).",

You deduct mileage or actual vehicle expenses. Not both.\n\nYou deduct other non car business expenses. You do not deduct the standard deduction yet. \n\nYou then calculate your self employment taxes on the remaining profit.\n\nNow you move to the 1040 form, and here you deduct your standard deduction before applying the 10% tax bracket.\n\nSo even with 0 taxable income, you still have the self employment taxes to pay.",

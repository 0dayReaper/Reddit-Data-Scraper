    "postText": "I posted the same question in parenting section, but did not get many replies. I thought I would try my luck here. I watched the 2023 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting and was surprised by how many teenagers were asking questions of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger this year. I always thought that we would bring financial education to our children when they were older, but it seems that other parents have started the process much earlier. Since financial education is not taught in schools, I'm not sure where to start. However, my children love reading books. Are there any good books you can recommend for us? Perhaps we can start there.   \n ",

This book was written for beginner investors emphasizing investing in broad market ETFs like VTI or VOO for their simplicity. Just set it and forget it even during market corrections until you retire. Broad market ETFs for the win.\n\nBonus books : The Millionaire Next Door and The Psychology of Money.",

Anyway, here are my recommendations.  \nThere is a book called 'Kira and a Dog Named Money,' but I couldn't find it in the English version the last time I checked.  \nThe other one is 'Panda's Financial Adventure.' This book delves deeper into the subject. It covers topics like mortgages, inflation, stock and property investments, and more. It's not a bad start if you want children to learn something about real-life finance without boring them to death. This book teaches these concepts through stories rather than in a textbook-like manner.",

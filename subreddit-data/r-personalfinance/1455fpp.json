    "postText": "First time home buyer looking to buy a new construction. Wife and I make $165k gross with a monthly take home of $9.2k. Home is $585k, we\u2019re putting down 20% with an interest rate of 6.125%. Our estimated monthly mortgage, including taxes and insurance is $3.6k. With utilities we are expecting a home cost of $4.1k, and all other expenses around $2.1k leaving 3k leftover. We have no car payments, no debt and no kids but are planning to have some in a couple of years. Am I putting too much into a home or saving enough every month? Thanks in advance!",

But if you really have no transportation expenses (and won't in the future) I can't see why you couldn't have a bigger house payment.\n\nJust as a for-reference, my wife and I had similar income when we bought our first house, but we only paid $260k. We have other expenses, but that house payment wasn't always fun for us to make every month.",

You may have car payments again. \n\nYour house may also need big repairs. Had my furnace fan blow middle of January last year and that was not a fun unexpected $1,000 to replace. It was 10 degrees that week, waiting for funds wasn't an option. \n\nAnd kids are expensive (just had my first 6 weeks ago) when that day comes for you.",

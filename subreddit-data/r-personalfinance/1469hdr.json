    "postText": "Circumstance means my current job is $13/hour, 20 hours a week, so I got turned down from a $5k personal loan due to my low income. I had a no-collision car accident last month, so I'm having to abide by my carpoolers' schedules. How can I pay off my CC, and get money for an auto loan? My credit score is about 740.",

Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K.\n\nSell things you don't use anymore. Start a side hustle for extra income.",

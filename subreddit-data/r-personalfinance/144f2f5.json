    "postText": "I have a TIAA 401(a) through a previous employer that I left in 2021. My current employer uses Fidelity for its 401(k). I'm thinking of transferring it out of TIAA, mostly because I don't want to keep track of a separate institution's account. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTIAA told me I have 4 options:\n\n&gt;Generally speaking, you have four options regarding your retirement plan once you separate from service:  \n1. You may leave your accounts with TIAA.  Your accumulations will remain tax deferred and continue to participate in the investment experience of the underlying funds.  You will continue to receive Quarterly Statements, and you may still choose how to invest your funds.  \n2. You may rollover your balance directly into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA)  \n3. You may rollover your balance directly into a new employer\u2019s plan if the plan allows for incoming rollovers.  \n4. You may request your balance as a cash withdrawal\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm thinking of doing either #2 or #3. Is one better over the other? If I do #3, does it affect my limits for this year?",

            "comment": "\\#2 at Fidelity will give you many more choices for investments (funds, individual stocks, etc.)\n\n\\#3 will give you a much smaller set of choices but it's possible some funds will be available at somewhat lower fees (plans with a large number of participants often have lower fees). You can check your 401K plans to see, for any funds of interest.  It's also possible your 401K choices are just not very good, so you'll want to evaluate that. Some 401K plans allow you to borrow against your 401K investments.\n\nHaving an IRA and a 401k at Fidelity will enable you to see both in a unified (sort of) view.\n\nRollovers do not count against contribution limits.\n\nThere are some other details already covered in the wiki:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/retirementaccounts/rollovers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/retirementaccounts/rollovers/)",

                            "comment": "Well, go look at the number of choices in your current employer's 401k.\n\nIn IRAs you can invest in an enormous array of mutual funds, ETFs, individual stocks, etc., whether at Fidelity or Vanguard or a host of other providers.  So we're talking about thousands (OK, tens of thousands) of possible choices.\n\nSo the difference in number of choices is quite large.\n\nNow, I think of good retirement choices as being target date funds and some of the broadest market index funds, so I'm not really recommending you go with individual stocks or obscure sector funds or whatever, but it's still more choices without going into those things. \n\nAs for Vanguard and Fidelity:  both good companies.  I once had retirement accounts at three different places (including Vanguard and Fidelity) but it became clear to me it was more convenient to monitor them all if I moved them all to Fidelity.  Fidelity seems to have a better interface including analytical tools for evaluating your asset allocation, etc.  Opinions vary of course.",

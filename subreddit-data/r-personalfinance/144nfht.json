    "postText": "30(m) - I was homeless last year and stupidly gave up on living in my car that was a little too small. I sold it for $6k. A few months later I got an apartment. Ive had unsteady employment since then. For the past year I've been using my bike and busses to get around decently. My city's busses are just okay. Sometimes I have 10 mile bike commutes, but i don't mind.\n\nNow, Ive been unemployed for 4 months, my savings are dwindling, and I havent managed to find a job despite months of applications (both professional, food service, and the like). I just found a car that I like for $3800 and I have $5000 in savings. If I dont buy the car I can live in my apartment for 3 or 4 more months job hunting.\n\nIf I buy the car it will be easier to get a job and go to work. If I sell off some of my belongings after buying the car, I'll have about 1-2 months of expenses in savings to find a job. If I still cant find one I could start living in my car (again. But this time it would be big enough to live in.)\n\nI feel a big pressure to buy the car to regain a more \"normal\" life and better transportation.  I wouldn't mind living in my car, even though it would be tough (and save on rent).\n\nTL;DR - I'm unemployed, have savings for 4 months of apartment living with no car. If I buy a car I will probably only have 1 months' expenses left in savings. Do I buy the car, then start living in it if I can't find a job to pay rent, or do I skip the car until I find a job and save more?\n\nAll advice is desperately needed! \u2764\ufe0f\u200d\ud83e\ude79\u2764\ufe0f",

That's great that you are able to bike that much and not mind too much, what's the point of getting the car if it's gonna force you to live in it in a month? That sucks.\n\nWhere are you living right now my friend? This can give us more info as to what your options are. For example, if you're living in NYC I could recommend you to move to xyz town that has a train going to NYC like Trenton, but if you're living in Alabama or some other more rural/suburban area it might be difficult to avoid getting a car.",

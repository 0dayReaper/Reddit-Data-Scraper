    "postText": "I've never talked to anyone about my financials and am embarrassed to tell anyone so I'm hoping Reddit can give me some advice or two. Recently came to a \"realization\" that I really need to work on my CC debt and have been lurking in couple of different subreddits to get an idea how others deal with their debt/what kind of advices are given. I've also watched a few YT videos as well but they all talk about the same thing. This has been eating at my brain for well over a month now, and I just really need someone to tell me what I should or should not do Dx\n\n# Background: \n\n* Income: $2,000/mo ($30k/yr)\n* Living with parents, so rent is 0\n\n# Debts:\n\n* Student Loan: $49k (paused until who knows when)\n* Credit Card: approx $11k in total \\[breakdown below\\]\n   * Amex Delta Gold: $840 (29.49% APR / 80% uti)\n   * PayPal Credit: $3,400 (28.79% APR / 91% uti)\n   * PayPal MasterCard: $6,300 (28.49% APR / 97% uti)\n\nCurrently Snowballing in this order \\^\r  \nI have a couple of other 0% interest payment plan (Line of Credit) for larger purchases that I have auto-pay on. Also am AU on 1 of my dad's card, but that's not my debt to pay. Thanks to this card, my overall utilization across all cards is 32% (per CreditKarma)\r\n\n# Savings: \n\n* Just moved $3k into Ally HYSA from an old SA that gave cents.\n\n# Credit Score: \r\n\n* 630 (CreditKarma / Vantage 3.0)\r\n* 674 (Experian / FICO8)\n\nLow score mostly from the high utilization across all the cards, but also due to one older cc (already closed, and just recently paid off) that I had a few missed payments during COVID. I worked throughout as \"essential worker\".\n\n# QUESTIONS\n\n1) Would it be worth looking into Balance Transfer CC or should I look for cards with perks like Cashback/Points? Apple CC pre-approval said my limit would be $500 and I'm worried any other CC I apply for will be just about the same. It would be nice to get a BT CC with 0% intro APR, but if my limit is going to be $500, it makes it pretty worthless to own, since I can pay that amount over \\~2 months easily. Plus, a lot of BT CC has no other perks so makes it meh to own after intro APR is done. Currently, any purchases I make is done through my debit card. Some point in the future I'd like to get cards with points so I can pay for flights with them.\r  \nOR\r  \nShould I finish paying Amex, then ask for a CLI a few months later, assuming I do a good job keeping it under 30%? I hear they allow up to 3x the current CL? I\u2019ve never asked for any CLI nor gotten any automatic increases since I got it 10mo ago.\r\n\n2) I'm willing to move over up to 1k from savings into one of the cc debts. But I'm torn on which one to apply to. Since I'm snowballing, paying off my Amex makes sense, but also putting it towards PP MC with highest balance and utilization will help lower overall interest I pay in total. Help?\r\n\n3) Would putting in time and effort for goodwill deletion of late payments on my closed account be worth it? The most recent one is about 1.5yr ago, with first one in 2020 (per credit bureau reports and CreditKarma). I think I have 4 or 5 \"late payments\", all of them being 30+ days late, except for one that's 60+.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you for taking your time to read my post and thank you in advance for any advices you give me.\r  \n",

            "comment": "I would pay off the lowest balance first. You said you\u2019re willing to use 1k of your savings to pay Amex, I would do it. Then just attack the next smallest debt and so on. That\u2019s what my brother is doing at the moment. You need to keep your credit card utilization under 10%. I have 3 credit cards and I keep them all under 10%. Before getting another credit card or a credit limit increase you need to show you\u2019re responsible in handling a credit card, don\u2019t be maxing out these cards. Credit cards are a tool to use to make more money if you leverage them in the right way. me personally I\u2019ve never been added as a AU I\u2019ve started building credit with a car loan that my brother co-signed and now managed to get 3 unsecured credit cards and another car loan by myself at a 6.4% without the need of a co-signer. my first car loan was like at a 11-12%. I just don\u2019t trust anyone to be on as a AU. I was always taught growing up, if I wanted something, go get it, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve always worked for everything I wanted and needed. and since you\u2019re living with parents, leverage that to make more money, start a business/ buy a business, or invest in real estate, ect. Hope that helps!",

                    "comment": "Thanks!\n\nYeah I'm snowballing through my debts right now. Once I finish the Amex I'll be tackling the next debt. Just wasn't sure if putting the extra 1k to Amex or highest debt was better idea. \n\nSo you think I should hold off on applying for any new credit/CLI until I pay off all the CC debt? Should I continue using my debit for all purchases or would putting them on my Amex be fine as long as I pay them off every month?\n\nI was added as an AU when I entered college, and anything absolutely necessary (in my case, mostly groceries or back in the early days the tuition/school fees) goes under this AU card. If I'm buying anything for him while I'm out, it goes on this card as well so we don't have to worry about paying each other back. I don't use it for anything personal. I don't think my dad added me to help my credit or anything.\n\nAs for my high utilizations, I was just bad at planning my money in college. I told myself \"I'll pay these over the next couple of months\" but obviously spent way more than what I could handle and only paid minimum. I've learned my lesson for sure, especially after watching all of these go from a few hundred to a few thousand... \"Out of sight, out of mind\" is what pretty much happened oops.",

                            "comment": "I mean honestly I would use those 3k to pay off Amex and part of the PayPal credit but just make sure to have money left over for essentials. You can start using the credit card again that doesn\u2019t have any debt, so pay off Amex then you can start using it again \u201cresponsibly\u201d. And so on. as far as the au, so long as your dad doesn\u2019t go and start messing up his credit which I doubt It\u2019ll happen so you\u2019ll be fine. Au\u2019s do help with your credit but don\u2019t get too many because you want lenders to see you don\u2019t need to rely on au\u2019s. But yeah try to stay under 10%. once you get higher limits you\u2019ll be able to spend more. It also helps to have 5-10k in the bank for like 30days for each bank. I got like 6 lol. it\u2019s to let it garden and it approves your chances of getting higher limits. credit increases should be 3-6 months otherwise you\u2019ll look thirsty to them. Make sure you don\u2019t have a lot inquires either, but I\u2019ve been told lenders don\u2019t care about recent inquires after 6 months. by the way how\u2019d you get approved for that Amex delta gold? I\u2019m curious. Makes me want to to apply lol",

            "comment": "I think the snowball method seems like a good fit. That's what I would do with these numbers. (It's actually what I did with similar numbers).  \n\n\nSome things I'd do. I'd take at least $2000 of that savings to pay off debt. 28.49% interest is way higher than the 4 or 4.5% I'd be making on that money sitting there. So, I'm losing money with that money like it is. I'd keep the $1000 in case of an emergency and for peace of mind, but there's no point not using the rest to pay off debt, IMO.  \n\n\nGiven the average card utilization I see, I'm not sure opening another card (even at 0%) is the safest bet. Here, the math is better to do it that way, yes, but it also gives an excuse to go into more debt later. It'd also trick me into thinking I'd fixed the problem, when I'd just delayed it. I'd just pay it all off--fast--and that will probably work just fine in the end. This is just me though. If you feel differently, the math does make sense here, it's the human behavior that may not.  \n\n\nThe only thing I'd add is that I'd go ahead and start working on the student loans once the card debt it taken care of. I'd just get a head start saving for when they do start up. That way, if they do start up, I can pay a lump sum the first day they're back and knock out a big part. If they are forgiven, I've made back that savings account and probably more. Win-win either way.  \n\n\nJut my way of doing things.",

You get one.**\n\nYes, just as i suspected, you were hooked onto that misunderstanding.\n\nIf you look at illustrations by average life expectancy, you'd see that the net return on cash value is around 5% and death benefit is also around that albeit a little higher. Why? Because cash value is part of your death benefit, essentially the part of it that you can access while alive.\n\nYou referred to \"one or the other but not both\" as if it's some sort of bad deal when at the end of the day the policyowner would get around 5% return on his money tax free. To \"get both\" would mean the policyowner would be getting around 10% return on his money tax free, how would that make sense?\n\n**The internal rate of return of 5% ignores the fact that most of your money is not going into investments. The actual rate of return on the money you spend on the policy varies over time, but it will never match the nominal return.**\n\nWhat? IRR is what it is. Are there some years where dividend will be higher/lower than others? Sure, depends on profitability of the insurer, which depends mostly on fed interest rate, but realistically and historically around 5% is good target.\n\n**If you can find whole life loan interest rates below the rate of return, sure. But you won\u2019t.**\n\nUh. you can. They vary based on interest rate environment, same as dividend rate. Historically, they'll more or less end up washing off. Example, before the fed rate hike, loan interest was 4% with IRR being around 4.5%. Now the loan interest is 5% due to rate hike, but that also means dividend rates should be going up unless the rate goes back down to near zero quickly.\n\n**I wasn\u2019t proven ill-informed. You don\u2019t understand your own insurance math, which is no surprise, since it\u2019s intentionally obfuscated to sell a bad product.**\n\nYou said you've never seen WL policy that wasn't horrible. I showed you WL policy with around 6% return. Or is 6% return with tax free access horrible for something that does nothing but go up? Where else can I put money in to get that return and diversify from $VOO? $SPY?",

Focus on how much money you feel comfortable putting in for 5/10 years, not on death benefit.\n\nIt's great as bond replacement, except it's more liquid, so you can use it as \"buy the dip\" fund or emergency fund before retirement. Can expect around 5% tax free return over life of policy from top mutual insurers like New York Life, Mass Mutual, Northwestern etc... That's similar to getting around 7% return from bank/bond for someone at 25% fed/state/local tax rate.",

If you see an illustration where you can access almost all your money by year 5, you should be good.\n\nBut you have to get it from top mutual insurers like I listed, they are owned by people who have whole life with them and have to give out profit via dividends. They have given them out every year for over 150+ years, and can expect tax free returns of around 5%+ over life of policy. Imagine putting money in Chase, if Chase would give you the profit they make with your money instead of whatever it is that they give you, and have it come out tax free and very liquid.",

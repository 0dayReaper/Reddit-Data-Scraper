    "postText": "Salary: $135K ($125K/year from full-time, roughly $10K/year in freelancing).Take-home pay about $5,800/month\n\nSavings: Collectively \\~$190K, put away about \\~$1,500/month from salary- $70K in 401k, currently putting 15% of salary in, plus a 5% match- $25K in Roth IRA, trying to max out every year- $40K in HYSA- $55K in money market fund/stocks/ETFs\n\nExpenses: \\~$4,300-4,800/month- $2,500/month in rent (by far biggest expense), expecting it to go up to $2,800 next year- $300/month to support family- $1,500-2,000/month in credit card (food, gym membership, utilities, clothing, etc.) -- most months it's closer to $1,500, but I will book travel probably every other month to see family and usually one big trip which will get me to $2,000 and once a year around $2,500 for the month  \n\n\nNo additional debt, like student loans/car payments/etc.\n\nAm I doing OK for my age? Should I be changing any allocations and any tips to reduce? The rent increase is a big factor for me especially if I stay at the same salary as before. Anything I can do to plan for the future more if needed? I also don't have homeownership in the plans now but don't want to rule it out completely in the next 5-10 years.\n\nThanks for the advice, I'm the child of immigrant parents and while I didn't grow up poor, my parents were pretty frugal. They seem to have everything figured out and I've tried asking for financial advice, but it's hard to validate because there's a bit of a language barrier. Thanks!",

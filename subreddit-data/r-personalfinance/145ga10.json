I'm thinking that I'd like to do 3 dividend paying funds in there: O, WPC, SCHD\n\nI think it would be cool to have tax free dividends being paid out in retirement.\n\nI'm wondering if anyone else does this with their Roth too?",

            "comment": "It sounds like you might need to refresh on the subject to make sure you understand what dividends are. They aren\u2019t growth, they do not add value to your account, they are functionally equivalent to selling a portion of your investment periodically. You could accomplish the exact same thing with investments that don\u2019t pay dividends.  also, dividends do not compound growth (because they arent growth).  the only thing they compound is number of shares, but that isnt relevant to your overall rate of return.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEH8kZxaWS4\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinQ\n\nFrom a tax efficient placement point of view, having dividend producing assets inside of retirement accounts (Roth or traditional doesn\u2019t matter) is preferable. But that is a separate analysis from choosing what assets to invest in.",

What do you think the value of the REIT would look like?  You wouldnt have all these dividends reducing the share price, and the overall the price per share would grow much faster over time.  but only looking at share price is not how you evaluate the return of a fund.  Dividends create a negative growth rate on the share value, but it is still cash that you receive as a shareholder, so you need to include it in your analysis for your rate of return.  But at the end of the day, there is no real functional difference between a fund issuing a dividend, and you as a shareholder selling a portion of your ownership in the fund.",

When you reinvest dividends, it just means you end up with a larger number of shares each with less value. If you buy funds without dividends, you end up with higher priced shares.",

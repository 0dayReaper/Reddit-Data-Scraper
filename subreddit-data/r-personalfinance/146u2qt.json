    "postText": "Hey guys, 28 years old and in the Navy. By the time I'm home from deployment next summer, l'll have $50k saved up, with no debt aside from my mortgage. My wife and I want to do updates on our house, but it isn't urgent. I was wondering what kind of ideas you all have for me on how I could turn my $50k into, well, more money. Always have been hesitant to dip into the market, mostly out of fear of losing the little scraps l've been able to save, losing even half of $50k would be pretty life changing. Any input would be great, thanks!",

Examples include:\n\n* HYSA\n* CDs\n* Treasuries\n* Money Market Funds",

            "comment": "*losing even half of $50k would be pretty life changing.*\n\nSounds like you have a low risk appetite. Investing in your house is not a bad thing so doing small updates over time to not deplete this is good. Is this in a HYSA? Right now discover, ally, capital one are all yielding ~ 4% with zero risk. You can also look at a CD yielding &gt; 4% for 12 months. Ally offers one that has no penalty for withdrawal and is currently paying 4.25%.",

Mostly, I know that $50k can be utilized to make myself more money, just don\u2019t want much of risk to lose it while still capitalizing on it. Looking at a short term goal of making $50k turn into more during my remaining time in the navy post deployment(about 18 months). Sounds like CD would be a good choice",

You are in control of your risk to reward. I love the market but you need to learn it without 50 k first or get someone to help you. Updating your house is cool if your in a booming area for real estate and can gain a lot of equity by doing it (also keeping the boss happy). I would advise you to sit back and really think what you want and why you want it and that 50k can do a lot! Best of luck OP, please don\u2019t get dooped and choose what will make you feel good about it for years to come",

If you already have an e-fund, then figure out how much you want you want to spend on your improvement, and then invest the remainder in your TSP using an asset allocation you are comfortable with.  If you haven\u2019t opened a TSP account then do so.\n\nWhile you\u2019re on active duty, open a high-tier credit card with Chase, Capital One, or AMEX.  The expensive annual fees are waived for you while on active duty so that\u2019s just free travel money and rewards, just pay the balance off every month.  I made a big mistake not taking advantage of this until late in my career.",

This is a good learning opportunity for the both of you.\n\nSorry to say that investing in the house is not a great investment.  Do stuff that is necessary for your quality of life and a few special things that you think will help with curb appeal but otherwise stay frugal because that money won\u2019t come back out of the house most likely.",

That's free money you can't pass up. Invest in the C or S fund or a combo of both especially during market corrections until you retire or get discharged. I highly recommend the Roth TSP. \n\nOpen up and max out a Roth IRA asap. There is a book you can borrow from your local library. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle. This book was written for beginner investors emphasizing investing in broad market ETFs like VTI or VOO for their simplicity. Just set it and forget it even during market corrections until you retire. Broad market ETFs for the win.\n\nIf you have extra money, gradually increase your TSP to the max of $22500 if you're comfortable with your monthly budget. If you receive CZTE in the future, invest that into your Roth tsp. Military personnel are allowed to exceed the TSP annual contribution limit and contribute up to $66,000 if receiving CZTE.",

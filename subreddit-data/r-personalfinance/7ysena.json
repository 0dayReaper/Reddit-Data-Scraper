    "postText": "https://medium.com/the-long-now-foundation/how-warren-buffett-won-his-multi-million-dollar-long-bet-3af05cf4a42d\n\n\"Over the years, I\u2019ve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I\u2019ve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&amp;P 500 index fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.\n\nI believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I\u2019ve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Over the decade-long bet, the index fund returned 7.1% compounded annually. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 funds returned an average of only 2.2% net of all fees. Buffett had made his point. When looking at returns, fees are often ignored or obscured. And when that money is not re-invested each year with the principal, it can almost never overtake an index fund if you take the long view.\"",

Of course he thought that when he entered the bet the first time!\n\nIf they don't make the bet again, I hope somebody tracks it in another 10 years.\n",

Somehow it seems more likely that there's some voluntary way to either release life or forestall death if it's for an event that was planned for or looked forward to survive until.\n\nIt's an interesting thought, though I have no idea if it's true. I imagine trying to actually demonstrate the existence of such a capability would require a study and not just positive examples.\n\nI suspect there are already studies, writings or lectures on the topic and would be interested in a recommendation.",

Nobody would want to do that, especially if the results weren't completely within their control, and they certainly aren't with investing.",

Nowadays, high AUM doesn't equal more $. Exactly as Mr. Buffett highlights, passive investments are outperforming active ones, leading hedge funds to drop fees and reduce restrictions on capital. This often leads to a shorter lockup period on funds as well as clauses that require a fund to beat a specific benchmark in order to charge fees. This is to incentivize investors to put their money with those funds, as there has been a max exodus of institutional and individual capital to passive investments.",

When everyone is one one side of the boat, it's invariably the wrong side of the boat to be on, and right now that's the side with ETFs. Obviously that's an opinion, but there are some pretty clear logical reasons why the boom in passive investing *can't* continue, it's just a balloon looking for a needle. Without getting into any of the more nuanced reasons, the very fact that you have (or have had this past decade) a price-insensitive bid for the S&amp;P 500 (and the market at large) means things that would normally be priced in by market participants aren't being priced in. \n\nJust look at what happened with the VIX complex a few weeks ago. I can't tell you how many times I was told on the various investing subreddits that the low volatility of this decade is the new normal and *that* will be the mean it will revert to as it gets out of whack. People who bought into that line of thought argued that with the explosion in machine learning and data-driven world and markets, volatility *should* be lower as the market becomes \"smarter\". That was a logical argument--until it wasn't. \n\nSomething to think about: global macro hedge funds have been hurt disproportionately hard over the past few years. I'm not talking about funds that Joe Schmoe with a finance degree from NYU started, I'm talking guys that have 10-30 year records of outperforming in a big way. [Paul Tudor Jones](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-01/tudor-will-shutter-discretionary-macro-fund-in-restructuring), [Hugh Hendry](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-14/hugh-hendry-s-eclectica-fund-closes-after-15-years-amid-losses), [John Burbank](http://www.pionline.com/article/20171212/ONLINE/171219917/passport-capital-to-close-flagship-hedge-fund-at-the-end-of-the-year), even passive fund giant [BlackRock](https://www.reuters.com/article/blackrock-hedgefunds-closure/blackrock-closing-global-macro-hedge-fund-idUSL1N13D17320151118) shuttered their active macro fund. How is it that the very class of hedge funds that is meant to be a *hedge* against geopolitical risks is dwindling at the same time that [geopolitical risk is rising faster than it has in years](https://www.blackrockblog.com/2018/01/09/geopolitical-risk-2018/)? Note the source of the last link is a company whose bread and butter is passive investing, they have no reason to give investors a reason to look elsewhere.\n\nOh, and by the way, after ten years of record outflows, hedge funds are finally seeing net inflows, with global macro [leading the pack](http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2017/10/23/hedge-fund-assets-set-fifth-quarterly-inflow-recor).

The system was programmed to reject anything greater than a 10% change because \"it'll never drop by that much in ONE day!\". Well, it did. And we had to call the IT guy back to the office (we were pricing after hours) to remove the 10% restriction so we could actually price the funds.\n\nNot gonna lie, those were pretty scary times. \n\n",

What Renaissance does is, it has top-of-the-line direct internet connections to the various servers.  So it will, say, see you want to buy some stock on Server A.  It then goes and buys that stock on servers B, C, and D before *your* buy order even gets to those servers over the network.  It then relists it for a small profit-- and sells it to you.\n\nSo it's basically a form of frontrunning using network latency.

However, all the time he blithely ignored the fact that the overall 10 year performance of the S&amp;P 500 was only 7.1% which is very close to the 100 year historical average of 10% (which adjusted for inflation is about 7%). Although S&amp;P only started in 1957 you can compute the average of an S&amp;P simulacrum. So the S&amp;P was just doing its thing while the hedge funds were just doing their \"things\" which mostly amount to underperforming the S&amp;P500.   Hedge funds only really outperform when the market is crashing or losing money. ",

The S&amp;P500 is an index of the 500 largest US-based corporations.  In addition to the list itself, it tells what fraction of the total capitalization each corporation represents (ie, the biggest corporation is much, much bigger than the 500th biggest corporation, so the S&amp;P500 proportional weights the biggest corporation more).  An S&amp;P500 index fund holds shares of stock of all the companies in the index, and it holds more shares of companies that are weighted more heavily in the index.  There are other indexes besides the S&amp;P500, that might represent small companies, or foreign companies, or bonds.  And there are indexes that weight the companies differently (number of employees or gross revenue instead of capitalization).\n\nETFs are one way to have a single investment that holds many different companies' stocks.  The other most common way is a mutual fund.  For the discussion in this thread, it makes no difference whether you use MFs or ETFs to do index investing.",

I get it now. \n\nWorking for someone else, not being in control, seeing the profits of your work go to someone else\u2014is possibly the most infuriating thing ever. \n\nIf you\u2019ve got to work you may as well be the owner cause you\u2019re just staring at assholes and elbows otherwise. \n\nThat said, my childhood left me wanting for nothing\u2014and it\u2019d be nice to do the same for my kids.

He wants to give it all to Hospice\u2014after how well they treated his dad as he was dying) \n\nI guess the point of the post is my Dad doesn\u2019t see himself retiring until into his 70s. When he isn\u2019t working he reads, plays Civil 5, and golfs. I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be satisfied with that life for very long. ",

Buffett got so mad that he bought more shares, then fired the guy. Later, Buffett admitted that was a little impulsive, because he could have instead invested the money that was offered back into BH and made $200 billion in investments.",

It also turns out that the people who get paid big bucks to pick stocks aren't, on average, very good at it anyway.\n\nThere are ones that track the ASX200 and the ASX300 in Australia (and probably others). For example: https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/retail/portId=8129/?overview \n\nNote I have no idea if that fund is any good. I have no idea if the fees are above or below normal market in Oz. At a glance 0.75% is ridiculously high, but maybe that's how it works in Oz. The wholesale version of it (https://www.vanguardinvestments.com.au/retail/ret/investments/product.html#/fundDetail/wholesale/portId=8100/assetCode=equity/?overview ) is way more reasonable at 0.18%, but it has a half a million dollar minimum, which isn't...\n",

Since it just follows a simple rule like a robot, there's almost no human factor involved, so it's very cheap to run index funds. Index funds may only need to make transactions once a year to update their holdings. Index funds might only have annual fees of 0.1%\n\nThe flipside is actively managed mutual funds which depend on human managers that try to beat the market. They may make frequent transactions. Active funds can have high fees (expense ratios) like over 1% (10x an index fund).\n\nThe premise is that you can't really beat the market in the long run, so the lower fee index funds will beat high expense funds in the long run.",

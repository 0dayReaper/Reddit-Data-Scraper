    "postText": "A company wants to have third round interviews in person, across the country. They are paying for my travel and lodging, and I need to reach out soon to make arrangements.   \n\n\nI have family nearby in the city and I want to extend my return date by a week. It would be nothing extra for them and would enable me to see my family. I would cover lodging for the extra days, obviously.   \n\n\nIs there any issue with this idea? I am very serious about the job, and don't want any of this side stuff to negatively influence their perception of me. Is there anyway to phrase this to make it more palatable? Maybe I could say something like I'd like to spend more time in the city to see living options etc? This is definitely true as well.   \n\n\nWould love your advice, thanks!",

    "postText": "Hi all, I finished reading Pit Bull by Marty Schwartz. I've read that Marty made 25% a month while he was trading in the 1980s.\n\nHow does one calculate 25% though? Let's say you're a swing trader and make 5 trades a month. Each trade made you 5% in terms of capital at risk. You risk 1% of your account per trade. What is my return? Is it the sum % of all my trades (in this case, 25%)? Or is it the return of my entire account's capital? Let's say because I risked only 1% of my capital per trade, I didn't use all my capital for my 5 trades during that month.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks",

If there are any significant capital injections during the month then you need a more complicated formula like Money Weighted Rate of Return. But no, any definition that selectively looks at a return percentage on only a small portion of the portfolio is misleading IMO.",

            "comment": "ROI of 25% means if he had $100,000 to start with he ended up with $125,000 at the end of the month.\n\nIf you did the sum method\n\n$20,000 5% = 1000\n\nIf you did that 5 times you invested $100,000 but you returned $5000 which is a 5% ROI.\n\nWhen I google Marty Schwartz there is a music teacher.  So, I kept digging.\n\nYou would think someone that made 25% monthly returns since the 1980s would be quite famous.  Warren Buffett is pretty famous and he is only a billionaire.\n\nBTW. a 25% monthly return meant he doubled his money every three months.\n\nif I started with $100,000 and doubled my money every three months for the last 34 years, that would be 4 times year \\* 34 years equals 144 times I would have doubled my money in that time frame.\n\n  \nThat is 2 raised to the 144th power\n\nJanuary $100,000\n\nApril $200,000\n\nJuly $400,000\n\nOctober $800,000\n\nJanuary $1,600,000\n\nApril $3,200,000\n\nJuly $6,400,000\n\nOctober $12,800,000\n\nUsing math that would be 2 raised to the 144th power.\n\nI know if i was making 25% return each month, I certainly would not stop doing that.\n\nHe would be worth 22,300,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000\n\nI am not really sure what that number is, but I am pretty sure it is more than the entire wealth on planet earth and then you can add the monetary value of all the natural resources of planet earth value, and he would be worth more than all of that.\n\nLet's say everyone on planet earth is worth $1,000,000,000\n\n8,000,000,000 people times $1,000,000,000 = 8,000,000,000,000,000,000 that is 8 quintillion dollars.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOh wait, he also promotes himself and offers a class where you can learn how to trade like him.  It looks like he made his money with options and risking it all.  On the third Friday of every month, it is make or break.",

    "postText": "Question1 : Long story short, I am about to start a new job, and although they offer a HDHP plan, i intend to join my wife on her HDHP as a dependent. I have 2 HSAs + a HSA investment account from my current job. I ended up with 2 HSAs because my current employer switched the provider from HSA Bank to Allegiance last year.  I have $1040 in HSA Bank  + $10,400 in the HSA Bank linked investment account. I have another $1,100 in the Allegiance account.  What should I do with these HSAs now that I am about to go as a dependent on my wife's insurance ? Both HSA Bank and Allegiance have a $3.95/month maintenance fee after I change jobs.\n\nQuestion2 : Me and my wife file jointly, and both have our 401k accounts. I recently started contributing to a traditional IRA. Because of our MAGI and the fact that we are covered by a retirement plan at work, I am not eligible to take any deductions on IRA contributions. If in future I convert this account to a Roth IRA, will I be taxed only on earnings or on the contribution amount too ?  i.e. If I have $1,000 in IRA where $800 was from my bank account, when I convert to Roth am I paying tax on the entire $1,000 or just the $200 in earnings ? Thanks in advance!\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Fidelity has the gold standard HSA with no fees and basically unlimited investment options. \n\n&gt; Because of our MAGI and the fact that we are covered by a retirement plan at work, I am not eligible to take any deductions on IRA contributions. \n\nIf you don't have any money in a Traditional/Rollover/SEP/Simple IRA, you should be doing Backdoor Roth IRA contributions. \n\nSee: https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/backdoor-roth-ira-tutorial/\n\nAlso see: https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/17-ways-to-screw-up-a-backdoor-roth-ira/\n\n&gt; If in future I convert this account to a Roth IRA, will I be taxed only on earnings or on the contribution amount too ?\n\nSince they were non-deductible contributions, you would only be taxed on the growth. This is basically what you *should* be doing, per above. \n\nMake sure you fill out Form 8606 correctly.",

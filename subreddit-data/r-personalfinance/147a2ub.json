    "postText": "firstly: luckily, no one was hurt. I crashed into two parked cars. \n\nmy dad who doesn't speak english is out of state right now. the car and insurance is under his name. I do plan to pay for everything because it's my fault, but i want to get as much coverage as possible because i'm still paying for my college tuition and i don't have much savings. \n\nmain issue: the google reviews of his insurance (country wide insurance) is horrendous. which adds up because the reviews mention it's very cheap. i feel so bad because some of them mention how they got hit by the policy holder of this insurance and they're struggling to get money. i don't know what to do because they were very kind people and it seems like they're going to have a hard time getting reimbursed. \n\nwhile that's concerning, i also don't think it will cover anything at all on my side because i doubt there's any coverage. the repair fee i'm fine with but i don't think it'll even cover the towing fee. even worse, cops were involved and they towed my truck away. i also looked up the towing company which is pro bodies collision and the reviews are also very negative, saying that people got charged hundreds and even thousands in fees. i don't have that type of money to pay that much in towing fees ON TOP of repair fees. i mean, the vehicle itself costed my dad $3000 since it's a used car. what should i even do??? please help me",

This is the responsibility of the insurance company.  In fact,don't communicate with the people at all. only talk to the insurance company.\n\nGood luck.",

You may want to look at getting an account somewhere like HSBC that has branches in both countries.\n\nThe investment accounts may be able to stay open, but you should absolutely research how India will treat them for tax purposes. The 401k in particular; countries don't always recognize the tax advantages of each other's retirement savings accounts.\n\nYou'll still need to file US taxes for 2023, and since you only worked half the year you probably had too much taxes withheld, so you'll want to do so anyway. You can use the foreign earned income exclusion or the Foreign Tax Credit to avoid US taxes on Indian income for the rest of the year.",

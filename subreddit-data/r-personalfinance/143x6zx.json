She claimed to have All State in the police report but didn't have any.  \n\nWhat happens if I don't pay the ER charges? They don't have my social, but they do have my driver's license. Is there a way to at least get it reduced? \n\nI did use my own health insurance and this is my remaining balance.",

It was a great day. It was also a rental car because my car was in the shop from being hit by another stupid driver a month prior.",

You are not required at all to agree to pay. You can ask the hospital to strike those clauses from the forms you sign.  If they try to come at you with an iPad to digitally sign, be a pain in the ass and tell them you want they payment clauses struck out amd if they have to print it instead, they print it with the payment clauses removed.   The hospital is required by law to treat you no matter what, even if you didn\u2019t agree to the payment clauses.  \n\n\nAnd this is what happens after - you do a shit ton of hw for what care should cost.  If the hospital demands a ridiculous amount over, you refuse to pay.  You demand they charge you fair market price.  If the hospital doesn\u2019t budge, you refuse to pay.  The inevitable will happen where they\u2019ll send you to collections and the collections company will try threatening you.  But you tell the collections company that you want to see written evidence showing that you agreed to pay the bill.  The collections agency won\u2019t be able to do it of course, because you refused to sign the forms with the payment clauses in there.  They\u2019ll have to go away and take the write off. \n\n\nNow the point if this advice isn\u2019t to manipulate the system and get free care, but why should a consumer agree to pay something they have no idea what the prices are before they accept the service?  It\u2019s a great way to get fucked.  Hospitals completely rely on opaqueness to rip people off.  Yes, I get that this is hard to do if you\u2019re unconscious or something, but if you have a family member signing forms for treatment, they should also know about this so they can strike the clauses out.  \n\nOp, if you didn\u2019t sign any payment forms, the hospital can buzz off and it\u2019ll be hard to collect.  They\u2019ll scream, shout, and threaten with collections, but tell them to show you the forms.  If they can\u2019t produce them, they\u2019re fucked.  You pay what you want or they can write it off.",

    "postText": "For context I recently turned 26 years old and am planning to purchase a home in the next year. Live in a MCOL to HCOL area. Home will likely be between 800-900k. Between main job and other work making 140-150k pretax. Living with fiancee, will be married by time of home purchase. Her financials are good, she earns less than me, but was financially responsible sooner than me so we have a similar amount of money currently saved. Only current debt is on my vehicle, around 28k owed on 0% interest for the next 4 years.\n\n\nFor the past year and a half I have been actively saving for a home. Putting away roughly $4000 a month specifically towards the home purchase. This is all in Treasury bills and a HYSA. Because of this I haven't been contributing to my retirement as much as I could have been. Maxed out my Roth IRA the past two years, but only have been contributing  3% to my 401k. (Company has a profit sharing plan, so I will receive the same contribution from them regardless of how much I put in). I have only a little over 20k in retirement savings, but around 70k in my dedicated house savings, and 45k in my general savings. \n\nMy concern is that between the unknown of the future housing market and possibility of other expenses with a home purchase I may need more money than previously anticipated. I don't want to risk having my money locked into a retirement account, but I also don't want to put myself too far behind on my retirement savings. \n\nShould I bump up my 401k contributions now, or should I wait until after my home purchase? Did I make a mistake prioritizing most of my savings towards a home? I appreciate any insight or advice.\n\n\n\n\nTldr: I have been putting most of my savings towards a house and have neglected my retirement savings. Have I shot myself in the foot.",

We are at around 240k combined gross income, with an 850k house that will be roughly a $5500 monthly payment (mortgage+insurance+tax) which will be keep us just under a 30% ratio of housing to gross income, which I see as being the general rule of thumb\n\nI will look into increasing my 401k contributions to at least 8-10% until I have the money saved for the house.",

Your taxes probably 6-7k per month depending on your state.  401k should be 3000 per month.  That puts you at 10k  take home.     If you mortgage eats up 5500 of that your looking at 4,500k to cover everything else.  Cars, emergency funds, home maintenance, food, etc.   Seems house poor to me.  \n\nPersonally when my income was twice that I lived in a 500k house and didn\u2019t feel rich.",

We are a $230k HHI DINK in the DFW on a $600k mortgage at 6%, late 20s. So roughly 50% of our take home pay (post-tax, what actually makes it into the bank account) goes to housing including utilities, atrocious property taxes, reserves for repairs, and the mortgage. I wouldn't describe it as tight but there's not a ton of room to fuck around if you're anxious about having savings in this economic environment. \n\nNice home, nice big bills when things break, and the aesthetic upgrade quotes are higher than for our first starter home because everything has gone up in cost and because they'll assume you've got money to throw around for your nice home. Exterior has to look nice at all times. I haven't even gotten into how much cash we unexpectedly burned through in the first 90 days of moving in. \n\nI'm not saying you can't or shouldn't do this, but if you're in a hot market where that $800k home ends up costing more to get into, and you're looking at 8% interest rates, I just want to know why you feel like you have to be in this price range.",

There are houses for a little less, but most are either a fixer-upper or in a less than optimal neighborhood. \n\nWe're currently living quite comfortably. For the past year and a half we've been putting around 5000-5500 a month into house savings on top of around 2400 in rent. Still go on vacations, spend money on luxuries, etc. So there's definitely room to tighten up our budget. Interest rate plays a big role in everything now, the down payment I can swallow, but if interest rates could drop back to sub 5% I would feel much more comfortable with a mortgage. That would get monthly payments for everything to almost $4500.",

Because if you're simply seeing $800k list, you need an indication of how bad the bidding wars drive the price at closing for that area. Also the change in ownership will trigger a property tax reassessment for you, up to fair market value. Wildfires are one of the leading causes of property disasters in the OC, so watch out for property insurance, run your budget tools on high numbers to be prepared. I've read price of labor and materials in that area can be brutal (turnkey properties will be more competitive, so best to assume you'll at least want to change the floors or something). \n\nAlso re. interest rates, you're in the same boat as everyone else, so imagine if rates *do* drop to 5% what that will do for the real estate market as a whole. This is why you buy when you can afford, so you should definitely run your numbers at 7% and 8% so you're not shocked 12 months from now and suddenly priced out.\n\nYou didn't ask for a \"You can't afford this\" lecture so back to your original q - I would definitely increase your 401k savings if you're so confident that saving for this house is such smooth sailing and you won't need as much in reserves to compete, fix, and finance as I think you will.",

I've run some numbers and looked into what other people are spending on insurance and property taxes or recently purchased homes in the same price range and area. It looks like the bidding wars have decreased significantly here luckily, likely because of the incredibly high interest rates. Haven't talked to a realtor yet since we're still a while out before being ready to buy. \n\nBut I'll take a deeper look into our budget and figure out how much we can afford to put away into retirement while still having enough saved for a home",

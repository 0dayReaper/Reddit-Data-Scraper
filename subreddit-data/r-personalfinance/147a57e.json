    "postText": "Hello!\n\nThe car that I've been financing during college was totaled due to hail and we had about $5.2k left to pay off. My dad had me as a co-applicant and primarily took care of the finances. He also had his own car that he financed during the same time and his current balance at the moment is around $4k. \n\nI've been told that from the dealership that you can only finance 2 cars at the same time and since I'm about to verbally release my car to the insurance, it would still be considered an open account until the lienholder receives their part right? If we were to disclose the dealership this info, could he still be approved or would he be denied? He also told me he has no issue paying off his stuff because he was gonna do it this year anyway but he would just have to expedite it if it means he could be my cosigner.",

Usually overnight to make sure it gets there by the 10 day pay off.\n\nThere really isn't a limit to what you can finance, but your loan should be paid off quick through insurance assuming you have positive equity.\n\nIt might take a bit for your credit to reflect that, but you can always get a letter from the lienholder stating that.",

I just figured that since I would technically be off the hook on the current vehicle loan since my lien holder's gonna get their check either way that we'd be somewhat okay with purchasing so soon",

    "postText": "We will be semi retired soon (mid 50s).  Both my husband and I work for same company.  We have the opportunity to go work at new company locations (it\u2019s retail).  Each job would likely be somewhat temporary (a year or two).  We\u2019d like to come back here when we are completely done working.  Would it be stupid to rent our house out and rent where we are working?  We live in an upscale neighborhood with lots of new construction around.  Perhaps we could work with local builders and realtors who have clients who need short term leases while their house is being built, or maybe we should just straight up try to find a long term renter?  Or not do it at all?  Just sell and rent where we are living?  I think we could get rent that is $1k over our house payment.   We have an ultra low interest rate and have been in our house 10 1/2 years.  We have zero experience being a landlord.   Hell me think this through.",

They will charge a monthly fee, but if you have $1k per month buffer it sounds doable.\n\nI am thinking about doing the same thing in a couple years.",

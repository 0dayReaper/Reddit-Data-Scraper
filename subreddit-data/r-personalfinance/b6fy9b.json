    "postText": "Wife works for a very small start up company with 4 people, 2 owners and 2 employees. She is in design. Past year she was working at $35/hr full time with health benefits but no paid vacation. $35/hr is very fair for her skillset in design especially for los angeles. She was on wage, not salary. She worked some OT but not a whole lot. If you calculate the standard hourly to salary using 40 hours a week multiply 52, she would have earned $72,800. She is normally scheduled to work full time mon to fri 9-5. However last year we got married and had vacations here and there and she was compensated $55,000 total because of the unpaid vacations. This worked out well for her small company because she didnt get paid while being away. \n\nToday during her evaluation, they low balled and offered  a salary of $54,000 with $3800 PTO/year. Health benefits are also included but it is the same as last year. The total compensation now is $57,800. They said this was calculated based on the number of hours worked last year (so they pretty much offered her 2018 W2). Employees are not going back to wage. \n\nI would assume an employer would calculate a salary offer based on potential full time hours, not how many hours one worked the year prior.  If she had PTO last year  or if she didnt go on the long honey moon then she would have received a higher salary offer. Now her starting salary is pretty much $27/hr so its a huge downgrade and now without OT. The owners said \u201cwell look we are giving you PTO now!\u201d which would offset the low ball. She is valuable at her company\u2014 70% of products sold are her designs. The other employee got a raise cause he was getting significantly less paid last year (due to no degree and no experience) in case you were wondering. \n\nIs this practice normal for an employer to use previous year\u2019s W2 to determine someones salary, especially if it works in their advantage? She will try to counter back with equity (since she started the company with them). During their meeting yesterday, they stated that employees\u2019 salary do not require 40hour work periods \u2014 only the projects need to be done. Because of that she wants to request working a maximum of 32 hours a week to offset the 14k a year reduction. Any advice?\n\n**1st Edit** i shouldnt have wrote this long piece and gone to sleep. I will answer everyone when i get to a computer. Thanks for all your help. \nFirst thing, I need to recalculate her W2 because she definitely didn\u2019t take 3 months off which everyone is calculating.  A big piece is missing here. I saw that in the last 17 paychecks she got paid 43k and i need to double check\n\nSecond, she is very valuable to her team. Anyone is replaceable but She is more difficult to replace. she knows their vision, she came up with the  company name, and all her designs are most of the ones being sold now, plus she designed the logo, all the packaging, website, EVERYTHING. Everything has been her idea. When she pointed out the products to me on their website, most of them were either made by her or she had some type of influence directing the other designer. She had some creative director responsibilities too.\n\nThe reason why they are doing salary is because \u201cit helps employees out\u201d by more flexible scheduling (dont need to go in if work is all done).  This is true. However they r low balling her because they are not making any money right now and simply cant afford her right now. (Its true they arent making money). She asked for equity at the first meeting yesterday and they said \u201cthats probably not the best idea for YOU because we arent worth much.\u201d WTF! \n\n**2nd edit**\nI am reading a lot of responses and they are all helpful but I can't respond to all of them. One thing to clarify is that i know for a fact she didn't take 12 weeks of vacation. thats ludicrous! They did shut down for 2 weeks or so during the holiday, and she didnt get paid for it. She also doesnt get paid for holidays (like during thanksgiving and such). We took a MAX of 3-4 weeks of vacation last year, not 12. i am going to sit down with her tonight to get the math straight. \n\n\n",

Never had or heard of a salaried job that didn't specify a minimum work week, usually 40 hours.\nI think what you are confusing that with is whether they can pay me less if I work fewer hours, which they cannot.

They took that number, added some paid vacation and ended up with what they think is a nice little raise to $58k. That's a reasonable starting point.\n\nYour wife can now negotiate. She can say that she got $55k last year, but with 12 weeks off. They are now offering her $58k with 3 weeks off. State that from her perspective she is getting +$3k but has to give up 9 weeks off to get it. Ask if they can see it that way too. Once she's established common ground, she can then understand what they care about most.\n\nAre they capped for cash and can only do $58k? If so she'd like to keep the time off, but maybe she could negotiate some up-front notice of when she takes her time off? Maybe every July and December is fully off because it's slow for them.\n\nOr maybe they really want her and are willing to pay $70k salary for the full year of work.\n\nOne thing to be careful of though, if she goes down a path of a 4-day work week for $58k or so, make sure that the work she is given can be done in 4 days, and that she states clearly when there is too much work and needs to de-prioritize some things or get help.",

Employers these days do not treat loyal employees better like they used to. It's a business contract between you and the company. My wife has worked for her company for 17 years now and her raises have been minimal at best (she's also been promoted and such) but they just recently raised the starting wages for management, close to hers. You know what they did for existing employees making more money? Nothing. No extra compensation, they were already making more than the new wages. Loyal employees screwed over.\n\nYou want long term loyal employees? You need to treat them better. It's a concept that's lost on everyone and every industry.",

You find another job but you rushed it because you need one and its alright, it took 4 months and you spent over $10,000 on bills etc in the process with $0 income so add what you wouldve made in that period in this case around $18,000 say. Your emotional decision just cost you $28,000. \n\nStill think its a good idea to make demands recklessly with no backup plan?",

When she handed her notice in they gave her *4 counter offers* starting at matching pay, to hiring her an assistant, to even more pay, and then her boss *taking some workload off until they got the assistant.*\n\nShe declined the offers because she knew that they'd fire her within 6 months if she took it and give her job to her new \"assistant\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf you aren't worth the matched pay before you hand your notice in, what makes you think suddenly you're worth it now to them?",

My last job was a miserable and no matter how much I voiced the problems I saw and offered solutions I kept getting shit on. I had a bit of time where I liked it, as I got more responsibility and acknowledgement from the other departments for my hard work. This all ended when my supervisor felt I was trying to take his job and moved me out of that office for half the week, when the department meetings happened. \n\nI put in my 2 weeks, after I had told my department head repeatedly I was unhappy and made it known I was shopping. I got an unsolicited job offer and after a week of talks with my husband &amp; potential boss I accepted it. \n\nAt that time the dept. head was on vacation in Europe, he got back a week later and was mad at me for not giving him a chance to make an offer. I straight up told him he knew I wanted to leave but did nothing. He said he didn't think I would actually go. He did make several offers and I refused them all, as it was just fluff and I would still be dealing with the same shit. ",

That was about 4 years ago.\n\nI was looking because my opportunities for development at my employer just weren't there. I accepted a position for a bump in job title (\"senior\" version of my role) and a bit more pay. My company countered with the same title, a little *more* pay, and a song and dance about their new career development program to be implemented company wide. I was comfortable, liked my boss and department a lot, and so I took it.\n\nHere I am 4 years later, deserving of yet another promotion, but, yet again, the opportunities aren't there, and I'm looking again. My company could theoretically counter again with a similar deal, but I've learned my lesson. I regret taking the counter now, because while I can't be 100% sure, based on what I know of the company where I would have gone, the opportunities to move and grow would have been plentiful.\n\ntl;dr: Even for those people who accept  a counter and stay longer than a few months, it's STILL rare for it to truly work out to be a good move in the long run.",

After a few months I could tell it wasn't really what I wanted to be doing. Instead of talking to someone about it, I started looking for another job, and found one fairly quickly. So I put in my notice and \"accepted\" the other job. \n\nA few days later, another department approached me (after talking to my manager) and asked if I would be interested in a position they had open. It was something I had talked about openly in the past, but had never seriously pursued (due to the other opportunity). Within a week I had interviewed and they offered me a transfer to that job instead. That was 3.5 years ago. I worried about accepting the offer to keep me for all the reasons other posters said, but ultimately decided to stay because I felt they had treated me fairly and demonstrated that they actually cared about me, and not just the position. Ultimately, I am so happy that I did decide to stay. Best decision I ever made. ",

After a month of working there my boss took me out for coffee to chat about how it was going (not in an ominous way, it was going very well) and said \"So, you've been here a month which means we have to pay the recruiters -- they charge half the starting salary for a placement!\"\n\n\"Oh shit!\" I said (which happened to be the same thing I said two months prior when the recruiter told me my starting salary offer). Shortly after that -- like, just enough time for a check to clear, let's say -- the recruiter started calling me on the phone: \"Sooo... you're happy there, or you want another job...?\"\n\nUnfortunately for the recruiter's business model I was very happy there. Until a couple years later when there was a management shakeup, they started using a whitelist firewall for employee internet access, blocked Google (but not Bing?), my boss saw the writing on the wall and fled, they stopped giving bonuses, gave tiny raises, turned my job into babysitting Indian contractors. Then last year they announced a \"delay\" in raises.\n\nI worked at that company for three years, but all I had to do was contact that same recruiter, say \"I wanna blow this joint\" and bam, I had another job with an even higher salary at a company with much happier employees and the recruiter gets paid again.\n\nThat's a ridiculous and extreme amount of money (20% starting is more typical for recruiting firms), but there are obviously a LOT of other costs associated with switching out one employee for the next.

Employer realizes how fucked they'd be without them, so they offer a higher salary and/or create a new position and re-fill their old position too.\n\n1. fast forward a year or so when employer is \"restructuring\".  The position that was created for them is deemed redundant and they are laid off.\n\nSo in my opinion if you have to argue that hard for your salary (or a promotion) it just isn't in your interest to remain with that employer.  They don't see your true value, and that will resurface eventually.  Just move on to your new job who have already offered you a competitive salary and clearly want you.\n\nAlso, this is a startup which is inherently risky.  Typically startup employees are compensated for this with stocks.  If OP isn't even being given that, why deal with a startup at all?  Go to a more established employer with less risk.",

Would you be interested in that at all...?\" I said \"No, I don't think counter-offers lead to good long-term outcomes.\" He was a weird combination of sad and relieved and just nodded and said \"Yeah, that makes sense. If it doesn't work at the new place you can always come back...\"\n\nHe was a great boss in tough position and I know he had been around the block and back for 15 years at that company. He'd seen management shakeups, new policy BS, contractors and employees come and go. I really got the sense that he didn't want me to take a counter-offer for my own good.\n\nLater my boss asked (very politely, totally optional, if I didn't mind...) what my new salary was, so that he could make sure the company was staying competitive with the market. And during my exit interview I told HR who they should immediately give an enormous raise to before he realized he was being underpaid. So hopefully I did some good.\n\nBut you never accept the counter-offer. And if you're interviewing for new jobs you don't use that information during a raise negotiation.",

It\u2019s a formalization of last year with unlimited time off and no requirement to be in the office if your project is done. (*This is at least how I interpreted OPs summary and if it isn\u2019t plainly stated in the contract the contract needs to be ratified to reflect it*)\n\nShe has set a precedent of being happy with $55,000 as long as she gets to set her hours and work around her lifestyle. And both parties were happy with it last year. This year she is the one wanting to change the way the job works by picking up more hours after proving those hours were unnecessary, as evidenced by only working 3/4 of full time hours.\n\n\nReally this is a question of how many vacation days does she want to be able to take a year and then negotiating by trading vacation days off for a higher salary. It\u2019s also a question of is there even more work for her to do? If she wants more hours and the higher pay associated with them coming up with a reason to justify working more this year wouldn\u2019t hurt.",

You are right that a job audit is the best thing to do.

At a small company, that could be the case but if she is being directed on how to design or does not have the final say in creative direction then there is an argument she is not exempt. CA doesn\u2019t have a specific creative exemption but the company would basically need to prove the same thing if she is classified as exempt in CA. \n\nYou are also right that you can be an exempt, hourly employee. However, there is a legal argument that in not being paid a salary, you may qualify as non exempt because the wording of the law.

They may have used the previous year's W-4 or it's just a coincidence as they want to give 18 days of PTO and did the math with PTO and holiday pay.\n\n*Revised Conclusion...*\n\nEither they cut her equivalent PTO by 19 days or lowered her pay by $25.96 /hr * 8 hrs/day * 19 days = $3,946.\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat she should do is compare her pay (including PTO and benefits...) to peers (experience + title) at other companies in her area to see if her new pay is comparable to theirs. If it's the same, then nothing to complain about; if it's higher, winner winner; if it's lower, then determine if it's time to switch companies.\n\nEdit: fixed numbers and revised conclusion.",

I've never heard of anybody that goes from hourly rate contracting to  salary and earns the same rate unless it was a promotion, because now they have to pay whether you are working or not. \n\n\nThat said, 55 is the equivalent of 12 weeks off at your previous wage which is ridiculous. Work out a normal amount of vacation (including public holidays) and ask for that as a minimum. ",

He was able to negotiate on their behalf to get them a *higher* annual wage due to their no longer being able to work overtime.\n\nThey never worked a day of overtime in their lives, some of them there over 10 years. But his reasoning was that with the position they were in there was reasonable possibility for them to need to work overtime on a regular basis and they would no longer get paid for it.\n\nIt\u2019s all in how you tackle the negotiation. Personally, I\u2019d try to have an adult conversation with them about fair market value for my services. Explain to them that I like my job and don\u2019t want to seek employment elsewhere at this time, but cannot accept a decrease in my annual income. Lots of other companies offer salaried positions with PTO, so that isn\u2019t a game changer for me.",

I started off at minimum wage for miscellaneous class ($22 ) instead of architect ($25) because it was a building company and not an architect firm (? Their logic). They said that I\u2019d have my pay review soon and when it was time, they asked me to work more unpaid overtime and refused to increase my salary. For the next pay review, it was the same thing. They kept undermining my work and said I needed to do more despite me spending way too much unpaid time at work doing complicated things that I\u2019m not paid for. I was originally hired to do simple drafting and toward the end of it, I was designing new houses for them and making marketing brochures in addition to drafting. They mildly kept threatening that they would fire me and didn\u2019t need me so I finally just decided to leave because it was way too much mental stress. Don\u2019t let them treat your wife the same way. The dissatisfaction will add up over time until it affects her mental state really badly. Better to leave before it gets to that extent.",

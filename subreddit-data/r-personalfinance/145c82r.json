Will use all interest earned towards down payment so not in a rush to jump on just an property.\n\n- $210,000 combined income each contributing 10% to our 401ks but hope to up that after getting our home\n\n- no additional debts. 2 cars expected to run another 6-10 years at least. Aren\u2019t planning on kids.\n\n- live in a high CoL area with pretty high income taxes and property taxes.\n\nI\u2019ve seen the .28 of gross income rule and the .25 of net income rule online. Obviously, these give wildly different outlooks and wondering if there is a better way to figure out what we can actually afford.",

If after paying all housing, food, transportation, etc, and still being able to save decent amount for retirement, I call it affordable, no matter house crazy the price of the house is. You can then use the number to back trace the price of a house.\n\nThe reason why income-percentage based rules won't work to determine housing affordability is because it assumes too much. The fundamental of those rules is so that after you pay for housing, you should have certain \"percentage\" left for the rest (including transportation, fun, food, etc) but clearly no one is the same and no place is the same. The key is percentage. A person who makes 300k can still comfortably drive a 20k car as the person who makes 50k. It makes no sense to allocate the same percentage of income to transportation for these two people. The one who makes 300k can certainly move the \"extra percentage\" into housing. \n\nIn other words, expenses don't scale linearly with income. At certain point, your expenses stops increasing noticeably as your income increases.",

            "comment": "&gt; I\u2019ve seen the .28 of gross income rule and the .25 of net income rule online.\n\nThe .28 of gross income rule is a more \"relaxed\" view; it doesn't consider any other debt or challenges you have; any planned retirement savings or tax implications.\n\nThe .25 of net income is a more conservative view; it does consider the planned savings / taxes etc; but still doesn't consider any debt or other special circumstances.\n\nThese thumbrules would give you a range that you can evaluate; use the low and high numbers against your own situation to work out what your monthly cash flow would look like.\n\nA third thumbrule to add if you have debt (in your case, may not be needed) is to ensure that your total debt-to-income is below 42%; most mortgage lenders do that check to determine your limit.\n\n\nNote these general thumbrules don't work too well when you have too low an income (because you don't have enough after covering food / work related transportation / health etc.) OR too high an income (a family with a take home of 5K  might spend 500-1K on groceries. Just because someone else has a take home of 10K or 20K doesn't mean they're going to spend 2K or 4K on groceries..)\n\nStart with these thumbrules : look at what the payments would be with the high and low numbers. Then put it against your budget to see how it works out. \n\nIf even the high number looks good : then you're comfortable, but check if you can find homes in your area that work out and fall below the high.\n\nIf even the low number doesn't look good : then you have a problem. You either have too much debt or too low income or other expenses / commitments that make it difficult for you to buy a home.\n\nIf a number in between works : set that as your maximum. Then look if you can find homes that meet your requirements within that limit.\n\n&gt; live in a high CoL area with pretty high income taxes and property taxes.\n\nThe challenge with VHCOL and HCOL areas that you may not find homes at those price points. For example - a .28 of gross for your case may translate to a max mortgage of 750K; which probably translates to a max price of 925 - 950K. 950K in the Bay Area or NYC may not have too many acceptable homes; may need you to move further out or other tradeoffs.",

If you start by making one you can experiment with different cash flow scenarios, which will then set your house price limit pretty accurately. 3x gross income is an ok place to start but you need to confirm it works with your plans for the next X years.",

            "comment": "For some context - I live in a high CoL state (CA). Bought a house last year for $617k with 4.99% interest rate. We only put down 5% (we made this decision to be able to afford IVF). Mortgage company I think overestimated our escrow so right now our payment is $4100/mo (our escrow balance and contribution are under review). Be mindful of all the other expenses if this is your first buy. We just received our supplementary tax bill that escrow doesn\u2019t pay ($4k, prop tax rate is about 1.2%), HoA fees ($90/mo), and we opted for a new build where the backyard wasn\u2019t landscaped at all ($7k). Water/sewage/garbage is also about $200 a month which we weren\u2019t used to paying. A lot of people don\u2019t consider all the \u201cextra\u201d expenses aside from the mortgage payment, so make sure to factor that in. For us with an income of $190k we can afford this and still have plenty for our financial goals each month.\n\nMy advice is really wait it out for the location too. I bought my first house while single and could only afford a starter home in a not ideal area. I ended up with quite a bit of equity in the house (played it smart by buying in a developing area) when I sold it after 4 years, but I was miserable living there! Make sure it\u2019s an area you enjoy, especially when you live in an area where the cost of living is high).",

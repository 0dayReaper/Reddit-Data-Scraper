    "postText": "Ok so here's some context, financials at the bottom:\n\n(USA) (24M) I  graduated college a year ago in May of 2022 with zero dollars to my name and have been working full-time for just over a year now. I finally feel as though I'm in a stable enough financial situation to consider buying a car. I'm currently still driving an old car I've had since high school, which is paid off. Problem is, it is getting to be very high mileage and needs a new catalytic converter to pass inspection which is up at the end of the month. I work in the construction industry and although a truck is not mandatory it would make things a lot more convenient for me. I'm looking to get something newer with better mpg and reliability.\n\nBased on what I'm seeing from the used car markets, cars that are 2-3 years old are selling for almost the same price as new. Combine this with the fact that used car loan rates are 6-7%, while I see dealers offering 3-5% incentivized rates for new vehicles, and it seems like newer is the better option if they continue to hold their value.\n\nI'm seriously considering the 2023 Toyota Tacoma SR5 4WD Double Cab for $38k, for both the reliability and the way they seem to hold value over time. Is this a bad idea? I would like to eventually purchase a home and be able to move out of my parents house some day and don't want to make any bad decisions financially. Looking to put $15-20k down, trade in value about $8k, and finance $10k.\n\nWould that down payment money be better off towards the balance of the loans? I know that its the logical answer, but it hardly feels like it would make a dent at this point. Feeling pretty hopeless about the size of the debt at this point. I figure if I'm going to be saving all this money living at home I can maybe afford to splurge on a newer vehicle?\n\nNow for my financials\n\nSalary - $63k/yr + $20k in bonuses this year = $83k in my first year\n\nRent - $0/month, Still live with parents\n\nPrivate Student Loans - $130k, consolidated and refinanced at 5.7% for 15 years - $1100/month\n\nFederal student Loans - $20k, planning for these to possibly be due this summer? About $100/month once consolidated to a graduated repayment plan for 15 years\n\nGas - About $350/month. Currently getting about 13mpg and commuting 60miles/day to work\n\nSavings - $30k in a high yield savings account I have saved over the past year\n\n401k - Contributing 6% to get max employer match of 3%\n\nRothIRA - $250/month automatic deposits\n\nStill on my parents health insurance, car insurance, cell phone plan\n\nNo credit card debt",

If you REALLY want a new vehicle, at least get a car or a small SUV. It'll be significantly cheaper, and you'll save $100's on gas. Unless you're hauling a lot of dirty equipment, a crossover type SUV is more convenient for moving stuff than a truck anyways. And if you are moving a ton of shit for you job they should be providing you a truck or compensating you for purchasing one.\n\nEven just getting something Subaru Outback sized would literally cut your monthly gas bill to about a third of what it is now.",

I used to, I have an Outback now that is WAY nicer for my job. All my equipment stays dry and doesn't get all dusty in the first place since it's not in a truck bed. \n\nAnd yes, trucks are MUCH more expensive than midsized SUV's. I bought an Outback Onyx(one of the top trims), and it still costs less than the mostly base model truck you're looking at and gets the better part of 30mpg highway. You can get a more base model vehicle that size for mid 20's and you'll save another $100+/mo in fuel and more on insurance.\n\nAnd again, I'll just reiterate. If you NEED a pickup truck for your job, then your company should be providing you one or compensating you for the use of one. Driving your personal vehicle for work use beyond driving back and for to location is a bad idea for multiple reasons. \n\nRegardless, this whole conversation is moot because you really just can't afford a $40k vehicle. \n\nEdit: If you're REALLY convinced you want a truck, then at least lose the full 4 door and the 4 wheel drive. That'll get your price down to about $30k. It'll still get worse mileage and I still wouldn't advise it, but that'll save you almost $10k and you have no reason to need a full 4 door or 4WD as a single person driving back and forth to a construction site.",

            "comment": "OP if you buy the truck your car insurance will skyrocket. I know your parents are paying for it but I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be happy paying at least a hundred more to cover a brand new truck. \n\nPlus size, since you\u2019re putting 50% down, you\u2019ll be able to easily swallow the loss if you want to sell. However taking a loss to drive a fancy Tacoma when you have $150k in debt is rough. \n\nAlso post purchase you\u2019d have $10-15k in savings. Wherever you do, please make sure you keep this minimum level of savings for emergencies. \n\nAlso, you mention wanting one day to purchase a home. Right now your DTI almost 100% given that a lot of banks only look at gross salary and not bonuses when calculating a debt to income ratio. Even if your gross salary rises to $100k your gross debt to income ratio will be around 60-70% given that you have to service them at $1200 a month. \n\nUnless you can put down a serious downpayment (like 50%), most banks won\u2019t lend to you. \n\nIf you\u2019re really serious about one day buying a house, I\u2019d tackle your student loans. It\u2019s really hard to discharge student loans in a bankruptcy so the only way to reduce your DTI is to pay them off. \n\nBest of luck OP! Rooting for you! You\u2019ll make your life much better in the long-run if you stick with your current vehicle.",

You will not have to go into your savings as much you would for a new vehicle. You will have a reliable car for three years. Electricity costs money too, but not as much as gas would for a 120-mile daily drive.\n\nYou could always rent trucks should a need arise.\n\nFor 60-miles consider car-pooling and share some expenses with fellow passengers.  I made it a point to car-pool early in my career to reduce mileage on my car and to save on gas and tolls.",

    "postText": "This feels like a dumb question because I think I know the answer, but I'm having a hard time deciding what to do.\n\nI've spent a bit more than typical over this past month and have racked up a small credit card debt of about $3000 that I'd like to pay off in the next week or so. I have a few different investments that I could pull from, but not sure which one to touch.\n\n\n**Credit Card Debt:** $3000 *(20% interest)*\n\n**VTSAX:** $7,500 *(2.5% loss to sell now)*\n\n**Apple Stock:** $3,000 *(250% gain so tax considerations to think about. Also this stock has historically done well)*\n\n**ESPP:** $80,000 *(100% gain on the portion I would sell, so again tax considerations. I know I should probably diversify this, but it's done historically well. This seems like the obvious answer to me.)*\n\n\nPlease help me decide. I usually pay credit cards off every month but budgeting went wrong this month.\n\n**ETA: I accidentally deleted another option when tryin to format this post. I have $10,000 in an I-bond that I set up to use as an emergency fund. 20% seems like an emergency to me, but not sure this is my best option.**",

Is it long term capital gains (and for the ESPP, a qualifying disposition)?\n\nIf yes, I'd sell that.\n\nHonestly, I'd probably sell more than you need and put the rest into index funds, but that's beyond what you asked.",

    "postText": "Sending my kid to school out of state and wondering if anything is deductible?  A quick google search shows a lot of the expenses are but only for a small amount, like $2500. I guess I will take what I can get but I'll be spending about 50K a year so just wondering if I can do better for savings?\n\nAlso, I was planning to take the money out of a Vanguard account. This has been growing for 18 years so I think I pay taxes as if it were normal income. This is just a normal stock account, nothing education specific.  Any disadvantage to doing this?  I have enough in this account for all expensed for in state (that was my savings goal). I did forget that the government will take a third of it though, but at least I am not starting with no college savings.\n\nI do have a small amount in the Oregon College Savings Plan. Not even sure if I can use it out of state yet, but that is the only tax advantaged plan I have. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I will need to check on the state though, Oregon takes 10% of my income and I think they consider capital gains income.\n\nIn state would be better and that would be the choice if it was all I could afford. But the school she will attend is better then what is available in Oregon, and I can afford it.  Just wanted to know how to make it the most affordable as it will impact when I can afford to retire.",

I think it was in her name at one time, we switched it to ours when we bought a house just because we had to show we had a certain amount of cash on hand.\n\nI guess I should make an appointment with an expert but getting some info here first was helpful.",

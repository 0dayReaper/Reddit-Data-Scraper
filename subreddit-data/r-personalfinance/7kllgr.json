            "comment": "Another interesting fact. I used to work for a large company who has a store credit card. You could make purchases with x months no interest. The fine print though... If you had even 1 cent left of that purchase and that seventh month came, they charged you interest on the entire amount of the purchase. Many times I seen people come in with hundreds of dollars of credit card bill asking what the hell happened. ",

            "comment": "Another thing I discovered.  So, my wife passed away in 2014.  I went to cancel her credit cards and such.  I called, I think it was Layne Bryant, and they canceled, and verified she had zero balance (she hadn't bought from them in ages).  Then I was asked if I wanted to cancel all the other attached accounts?  What other accounts?  \n\n\"When you sign up for a Lane Bryant card, you are also given a credit line for...\" and then he listed a few other stores she had a line of credit for, many of which are not in our immediate area, and/or had no online presence.\n\nOne, yes because she's dead.  Two, really?  Thankfully, those also had zero balances.\n\nWhen her credit report came in, sure enough, it showed she had credit lines (some for for over a decade) in those stores.  Some of those chains were no longer in business, either.  A few were very strange, like one clothing store had a credit line of $394.15 or some other odd amount.\n\nAnd yes, most of those had HUGE interest rates.  I'd say the average was 26%, but a few were 29.9% or one was 35.17%.",

From the beginning you can tell the person on the other end has been through some shit today and quite nearly in tears, what I didn't know is my supervisor was listening in on the call. \n\nSo I start my pitch and to his credit the guy sits the whole opener of the pitch, waiting for me to pause, and then hits me with it, \"I'm sorry, I know it's just your job and I don't want to be rude but I just buried my wife today (the woman who I asked for at the beginning of the call) and I can't handle this right now\" I quietly apologized and offered my deepest condolences, explaining that the machine just automates the calls and I would immediately remove his number. He thanked me and hung up. \n\nAt this point I'm fried and hit pause on the call cue, seriously needing a break and considering taking up smoking just for the excuse, but before I can process I hear my supervisor come over the headset. \"Why did you give up on a sale like that?\" \n\n\"Did you hear all that, what the hell was I supposed to do?\"\n\nThen my supervisor, 100% serious and without even the slightest hint of humor replies \"Tell him this sounds like the perfect time for vacation, his story is probably bullshit anyway\"\n\n\nThat was it, I was done. Logged out of my station, clocked out, walked out the door (ignoring my supervisor shouting at me the whole way), to my car, drove away and made it to the first light before losing it.

You have to assertively shut them down on this. I always tell them, \"Let's figure out the price, and I'll worry about the monthly cost.\" You might feel a little rude doing this, but their whole game is based on the assumption that you're too polite to interrupt their agenda. \n\nMy other tidbits:\n\n- Know more about the car than the salesman. This isn't hard to do nowadays.\n\n- I'm not convinced \"newer used\" is a better deal than new right now, but I drive a LOT and breakdowns are major problems for me. \n\n- If buying new, sit with your SO and list out each item of the trim level you're thinking of, and the one above it. You'll agree at the kitchen table that maybe the heated seats are the only perk you both care about, and maybe they're not worth a $5K package.  It's a lot easier to decide this at home than when the salesman pulls around the higher trim level for the test drive. \n\n- The \"no haggle\" pricing places usually just translate to \"you agree to pay more than you should to avoid some discomfort.\"\n\n- Exception - some dealers offer very good internet pricing. If you can research the pricing and features online, all you need the salesman for is to go get the car for the test drive. \n\n",

Their excuse when I of course caught it was well the payment is the same that you agreed to.  \n\nI walked out and did not buy the car. I don't care if it was only a price change of like $500.

Pricing data on cars is all over the internet: Truecar.com, for example. Select the car you want, make an appointment at a dealership that (and this is important) has that car on the lot. Show up to said appointment and make an aggressive offer based on your research. Being pre approved for the loan through your bank also gives you a one-up so there is no negotiation for term and APR rate. \n\nIf you experience any trouble buying a vehicle using this method you're in a scummy dealership and need to leave. \n\nI'll take your $300 now:)",

Whenever people bring up total price of vehicle, we instantly try switching it to monthly payments. With things like \u201cWell the monthly payments are within your budget, correct?\u201d \u201cYes, well I..\u201d \u201cPerfect! Now circle the loan duration and cash down option that works best for you.\u201d \n\nAllowing customers to haggle on the total price of the vehicle lowers the gross profit of both the salesman and the dealership. You can most certainly get a really good deal, especially if conflict doesn\u2019t bug you and you\u2019re a good negotiator. But be prepared to fight for that deal, because the salesman is fighting for their commission.\n\nI\u2019ve actually said no to people before. For example - A car that I know will sell, and we own it really good, meaning that there is great profit to be made on it. Someone tries negotiating it so hard to the point that it takes all the profit away. I\u2019ll try to meet them in the middle. But if they won\u2019t budge and want us to make literally zero money on it, I\u2019ll tell them no and to have a good day. ",

I should clarify that I started with a clothing store credit card because they seem to give them out like candy. In my case, I started with American Eagle, then got one at Macy's. This was years ago, I keep them open for credit history, and only use them (and immediately pay them off) if they are going to get cancelled.",

And they turned me down. My credit score at the time was mid-700s, I already had a couple of decent credit cards, I had no bankruptcies out other negative marks on my credit, and my utilization of those existing credit cards was fine.\n\nSo I have no idea why they turned me down, but I now look on it as a bullet dodged.\n\nEdit: this was before their red card (which does seem pretty decent, but I don't want or need another card), when it was just another crumby store card.\n\nAnd my debt to income was very good at that time too. So no idea why. But it doesn't really matter.",

She wants a certain lifestyle, and that's the only thing that matters to her. In court, she whined about how poor she would be if she didn't get the amount of alimony she was asking for. The judge had her bank statement and asked her about a restaurant charge to the tune of $80. She literally cried and said,  \"But they have really good burgers... why am I not allowed to have a nice meal? \" When the judge asked about her $900 a month truck payment, she said she needs the truck to feel safe. The funniest thing is that she eventually settled for a lump sum that is a fraction of what she'd get off she took regular alimony payments over the years. She has no concept of money at all. She just saw that large figure and went with it. Meanwhile, my dad is 63 and at least a decade away from retirement because she spent every single dime he's made in the last 40 years and they have literally nothing to show for it. \n\nOh, and her plan for saving money was to do a \"tiny house\" lifestyle thing. Ok. So she bought an old camper and renovated it. But the thing was basically a rusted out tin can, and AFTER renovation she decided it was not livable. So, it sits on my dad's property, rusting away. Total bill for a tiny house shithole that's headed for the dump? $40,000.",

I suspect stores like Best Buy where people make significantly larger purchases (a $1500 computer or TV as opposed to a $150 article of clothing) drag that average up, but *still.* I mean, I have a store card, but only because of the rewards/benefits I get for things I'll have to purchase anyway. I also don't ever pay interest on that because I pay it off immediately after using it.",

I purchased a few hundred dollar coat, and combined with the discounts, percent off, and the added discount from opening a card ended up paying just $35. I then went directly downstairs and paid the $35 I had put on the card and requested that it be closed.\n\nFast forward to about six years later when I have a sheriff show up on my doorstep telling me that I've been taken to court for the sum of about 8 grand. A few days of research I find a few things.\n\n1) The payment and closure was not processed at all.\n\n2) The address that I had put in was incorrect and I had not received a single bill, nor a collections statement over the entire period of time.\n\n3) This debt had been racking up fees and accumulated interest for way longer in the Macy's system than would be normal (this according to one of the agents at Macy's that eventually tracked down the case)\n\n4) Because the debt had left Macy's there was nothing that they could do about it.\n\nWhen I ended up contacting the collection company I was told that I owed the entire amount in one lump sum and no payments could be made. They figured they would be able to force payment automatically with the court case and had no interest in dealing with me.\n\nIn the end I had to declare bankruptcy just to avoid complete ruin and ended up paying not a cent, but not having anything like a credit score for well over the seven years. All over a $35 purchase. ",

I qualified for credit at 28.8%, but who cares because I was going to get 0%, right?\n\nThe copy of Final Cut Express shipped right away, but since the PowerBook was \"made to order\" (RAM upgrades, WiFi card, etc.) it took an extra week or two before I got it.\n\nThat's when I realized the fine print: the 0% offer applies to *the first transaction applied to the card*, and regular APR applies afterward.\n\nIn other words: I got 0% financing for 180 days on my $149 software, but had to pay 28.8% on the $3000 laptop. It took me *years* to get out of that mess. I don't even *want* to know how much I paid in total for that PowerBook.\n",

Macy's doesn't care about selling you products they care that you charge it to their credit card. That's how they make their money.\n\nThey send out 20% off coupons to credit card holders, who then go to the store thinking they are saving 20%, but in reality they are being charge 29% interest on the purchase so they actually end up spending more than the original price. \n\nBut Macy's doesn't stop there.\n\nThey have this \"charity\" card that you pay $25 for and can build up points every time you make a purchase. The promotion says it for \"charity\", but if you read the fine print, ONLY $10 of your $25 dollar \"donation\" goes to charity. The other $15 dollars goes in Macy's pocket as a \"sign up fee.\" But Macy's gets even more money than that because they are the ones who \"give\" YOUR $10 to the charity. You don't get a receipt for this. And you can't claim it on your taxes. But Macy's can. They take YOUR $10 from you, deposit it into THEIR accounts, then write a check to some charity and claim the tax deduction.\n   \nShady, shady, stores. Tis the Season to rob.",

Pay it off in full each month and take advantage of the reward points. \n\nFinancing is for appliances, cars, homes, tuition, things you can't normally pay off in a month. Look for 0 interest for 12 months. Places like Best Buy, etc. Pay those bills off before interest kicks in. Always pay more than the minimum. \n\nEdit: Forgot to mention even the biggest reason why you should use your credit card over your debt card. If your credit card is lost or stolen, it's better for the thieves to steal from the lenders and not your personal bank account. Easy to dispute fraudulent purchases and receive a new credit card then close an entire bank account and open a new one, all while waiting for the bank to reluctantly reimbursed you for those fraudulent purchases.",

For awhile there, especially the time when I was in heavy credit card debt, I would think badly about  credit cards in general. Boy was I wrong, nowadays credit cards are amazing. I have since changed then, now that I graduated college and have a stable job am able to afford things proper. I swipe with my credit card and then pay off the balance immediately every statement period. \n\nOnce you figure out how to use a credit card properly, it ends up benefiting you more than hurts you. Seriously, you get better buyer protection, fraud protection, cash back rewards, extended warranty... etc.\n\nI highly recommend making any type of purchase on a credit card rather than a debit card. If anything goes wrong - your credit card company will fight tooth and nail to get their money back. With a debit card, the bank could not give two shits about your money honestly - so it is more difficult to get your money back in the event you get ripped off or become a victim of fraud.\n\n\n",

The actual business model is to sucker folks into paying only 50% of the balance by the end of the promo period, then hitting them with an immediate 30% on the unpaid balance (more if they're capitalizing promotional interest over longer than 12 months), along with 30% APR ongoing.\n\nDon't be the sucker.

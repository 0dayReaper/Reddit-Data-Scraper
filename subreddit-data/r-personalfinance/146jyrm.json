    "postText": "I have a home that I bought back in September of 2020. The home is valued at around 610k owe about 500k the interest rate is at 2.70%. We are going to be moving to Jacksonville and will be buying a home. The projected rental price will be about plus 700 dollars a month over the mortgage we pay monthly. Would it be better to take the close to 100k in profit and invest in a mutual fund or expose myself to the risk of this current housing market and the likely downturn we will most likely see over the next couple of years. I know there are a lot of variable but would just love to get some feedback and perspective I may not have figured in.",

Risking having a tenant who floods the place and just tries to mop it up and not mention it until the mold in all the walls gets to be unlivable.  Obviously not saying that WILL happen but if I were you having so much invested in something and handing over the keys to it and being no where near it to check in would make me nervous.",

They field all requests, issues, hire the contractors, and then just send us the bill if anything needs to be done. It's been several months and the only thing we've got asked is \"how does the washer work?\"\n\nWe are keeping our ultra low interest rate and banking a bit more in equity by doing this. It has a cost, so you have to determine if it's worth it for you.",

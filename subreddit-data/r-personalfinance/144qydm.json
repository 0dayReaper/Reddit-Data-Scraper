    "postText": "So my wife and I were looking at a house for sale.  It is a nice house in a desirable neighborhood.  Good floor plan and layout.  Problem is it has some significant structural issues.  The seller says no problem we got an estimate and will give you an allowance for the repairs (seller can\u2019t make the repairs because the house is in trust).  My concern is the allowance is rather significant when compared to the asking price of the home (like 1/5th the asking price).  Does this seem possible because to my uneducated mind this seems like kind of a stretch for a mortgage.",

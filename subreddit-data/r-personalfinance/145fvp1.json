    "postText": "Looking for some advice on a family situation.\n\nI (F34) and my husband (M38) have some questions regarding my mothers assets. She is not dying - but we want to prepare for that time and make sure we have everything in place. \n\nBackstory - my brother (30M) and his wife (28F) currently live with my mother in her house.  They previously lived in a house that my brother owned, and sold for a profit. My brother took a lower paying job and since my mom was looking for assistance on keeping the house, he and his wife moved in.\n\nThere is no mortgage on the house, and they do not have to pay taxes on it as long as my mother is alive. Currently the house is worth roughly $1.2M. My brother and his wife currently pay half of the oil bill, and all other expenses are covered by my mother (water, housekeepers, groundskeepers -etc). Eventually, all payments will transfer to my brother and my mother will live there part time - but there will still be no mortgage or taxes. I should preface with the fact that I realize this arrangement is very favorable for my brother - but I\u2019m really just focused on the path forward.\n\nRecently - larger expenses have come into question, like needed to re-seal the pool.  Currently the will states that my brother and I will spit the house 50/50, but he now feels like every dollar he puts into renovating the house should be added to his portion of the will. \n\nMy mother also owns property in Maine, values around $500k.  That property would also be split 50/50.\n\nI was curious if anyone had ideas on how we should handle my brothers request of dollar-for-dollar, his investments in the home being directly reflected in his portion of the will. TYIA!",

I would say that should continue (assuming that's what everyone wants), and your mom should pay any maintenance costs, as it is still her home and your brother is just the caretaker, not yet an owner.  Your brother should not be paying any maintenance costs (such as sealing the pool), your mother should, which will eliminate this debate and let the inheritance remain at 50/50.",

This book was written for beginner investors emphasizing investing in broad market ETFs like VTI or VOO for their simplicity. Just set it and forget it even during market corrections until you retire. Broad market ETFs for the win.",

Go to the catalog and search for investing, buying stocks, etc.\n\nWall Street Journal articles about companies\n\nInvestors Business Daily this has lots and lots of numbers\n\nWatch CNBC or Fox Business Channel or Bloomberg or Wall Street Week on PBS.  They will talk a lot, but you can learn stuff.\n\nIf that is not your cup of tea, open a brokerage account at a discount brokerage(google discount brokerages) and dive in and risk real money.  Nothing like real world experience to help you learn.",

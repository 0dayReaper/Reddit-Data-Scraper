    "postText": "I\u2019ve been thinking about if I should do this for a while now, but I\u2019ll try to lay out as much of the details to see if it makes sense.\n\nI plan on buying my first home next year, April-May ish.\n\nAlready have 20% down payment saved but could save more.\n\nCurrently max out my Roth 401k (still plan to max this year)\n\n401k contribution is 18% currently and company matches to 5%.\n\nI\u2019m 41. Based on general rule of thumb I\u2019ve read you should have 3x salary saved for retirement by 40 - I currently have that saved with 401k + Roth IRA, so feel like I\u2019m on track.\n\nI have no debt and excellent credit.\n\nWhile I\u2019m still planning on saving more, one possibility I\u2019ve been playing with is considering cutting down my 401k contributions until next year to min 5% for the company match, which would allow me to save more for a house down payment or furnishings. I\u2019ll still have a decent emergency fund besides the down payment (over 10k).\n\nThe two downsides of doing this are I\u2019ll pay more in income tax as 401k contributions are tax deductible and that\u2019s almost a year of putting a smaller value into my 401k.\n\nJust wanted to get any thoughts on this or can see any angles I\u2019ve missed.",

If you normally max out (20500+6250+6000 for 2022) then that\u2019s $32750.  \n  \nOnly doing 5%+5% ($12500) would give you an extra ~$20k in cash (well, a tad more in savings, though also account for tax).  \n  \nIf we are talking only doing so for 1 year, then that\u2019s not bad as it\u2019s going towards an investment.",

Honestly there is more money to be saved by being sensible with your choice of house making sure you don't overextend yourself. That would achieve lower payments for the life of the loan. It is ridiculous how much bigger houses keep getting just so we can have space to hoard more stuff; every square feet of house costs money.",

    "postText": "# [Please click here to read the latest version of this article.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/kicked_out)\n\nUnfortunately, posts on this topic are not a rare occurrence here. Teenagers are often kicked out of their home without support, sufficient money, or time to prepare in advance, but there are some resources and options for teenagers in this situation.\n\nThis guide also includes some information for teenagers who are at risk of being kicked out.\n\n# First, please seek help\n\nIf you need help, there are confidential and nonjudgmental services with trained helpers that you can call or contact online. Sometimes these services get busy. If you can't reach someone right away, please try again until you reach someone.\n\nIn the case of a life-threatening emergency, please call the police or the emergency telephone number for your country (e.g., 911 in the United States).\n\nIn addition to the below resources, consider talking to an adult that you trust and/or an independent institution or service provider with community knowledge and resources. There are many options such as:\n\n- A teacher, sports coach, or staff member at your school\n\n- A school guidance counselor, school nurse, or doctor\n\n- A relative that you trust\n\n- A family doctor or nurse\n\n- A religious leader\n\n- A librarian\n\n  While most are not trained explicitly in this area, librarians tend to be resourceful and very good at research if you're feeling overwhelmed.\n\n- A staff member at local shelters, food banks, soup kitchens, etc.\n\n  Even if you aren't interested in that specific resource, they tend to be sympathetic and familiar with local resources.\n\n- Another adult you trust\n\n  It doesn't have to be one of the above options. Someone like a friend's parent or even a neighbor may be a good option for getting advice, sorting through your options, and avoiding mistakes. Most adults have a decent amount of experience dealing with government agencies, navigating complex situations, and have had their share of troubles too.\n\n## United States\n\n- Contact the National Runaway Safeline. They provide a valuable resource for runaway, homeless, and at-risk youth. The service is free, confidential, and available 24/7.\n\n   **CALL 1-800-RUNAWAY**\n\n   [**CLICK 1800RUNAWAY.org**](https://www.1800runaway.org/)\n\n  **TEXT 66008**\n\n- You can also text \"HOME\" to 741741 in the US to communicate with a [Crisis Text Line](https://www.crisistextline.org/) volunteer anytime, about any type of crisis. Every texter is connected with a Crisis Responder, a person trained to bring texters from a hot moment to a cool calm through active listening and collaborative problem-solving.\n\n- In most of the US, you can also call 211. They will help connect you with resources.\n\n## United Kingdom\n\n- Contact [Childline](https://www.childline.org.uk). Childline is a free, private, and confidential service where you can talk about anything.\n\n  **CALL 0800 1111**\n\n  More information is located under [*Moving out / leaving home* on Childline](https://www.childline.org.uk/info-advice/bullying-abuse-safety/your-rights/your-rights/).\n\n- If you're in England, aged 16 to 25, and homeless or at risk, the [Centrepoint Helpline](https://centrepoint.org.uk/) offers advice and support to vulnerable young people.\n\n  **CALL 0808 800 0661 (Monday - Friday, 9am - 5pm)**\n\n- [Here is some additional information about housing and\nhomelessness resources for young people in the UK.](https://england.shelter.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/23387/ShelterGuide_KnowYourRights.pdf)\n\n## Canada\n\n- Contact the [Kids Help Phone](https://kidshelpphone.ca/).\n\n  **CALL 1-800-668-6868**\n\n- You can also text \"HOME\" to 686868 in Canada to communicate with a [Crisis Text Line](https://www.crisistextline.ca/) volunteer anytime, about any type of crisis.

If it starts to be too overwhelming or you need help, please reach out to one or more of the resources listed above for advice and support.\n\n1. **If your home living situation was not abusive** and there is an option to make up with your parent(s) or caregiver, please consider it (even if it means a curfew, chores and hard work, or following rules you don't like). You can use this time to save up more money, find work, finish high school, and generally prepare for living on your own.\n\n   If things are uncomfortable at home and you're allowed to simply spend more time elsewhere, that's often a good option to reduce tension at home. Some ideas: get a cheap gym membership, do your studying at the library, get a part-time job, join an after-school group, or volunteer.\n\n   If you have fundamental disagreements with your family or caregivers and this would be a possible reason for you to be kicked out, it's probably best to delay announcing these until you're on your own and doing well independently. Maybe they are not great people. Maybe you don't believe in the same things. As long as you are safe, it can wait until you are in a better position to be independent. As they say, the best revenge is living a good life.\n\n2. It's generally illegal for your parent(s) or guardian to actually kick you out. **If your home living situation was not abusive**, one option to consider is contacting the police to get back into your home.\n    - If you're an underage child (under 18 in most of the United States) and not legally emancipated, it's almost always illegal for parent(s) or a guardian to kick you out.\n    - Even if you're an adult or legally emancipated, but living at home, it's generally illegal to kick you out without following the relevant laws including sufficient notice. The specifics depend on the circumstances and your location (you may consider posting to /r/legaladvice as well).\n\n  Contacting the police may be unpleasant and you will need to listen to the police officer, but your parent(s) or guardian will also need to listen and allow you back into their home. You shouldn't be carrying anything illegal (drugs, alcohol if you're underage, or illegal weapons) in general regardless, but absolutely do not have any of those items on you or in your room if you contact the police.\n\n3. If you have any relatives that you can reach that would let you stay with them for any period of time, this is one of the best available options if you've been kicked out. Aunt or uncle lives in the next state? Call them and find a way to get there. Any non-abusive relative that you know is probably a better option than heading to a shelter. Grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, step-siblings, you name it.\n\n4. Failing that, your next best bet is to contact friends, crash on a couch, and ask anyone you know that might put up with you. Try to consider *any* workable and safe options. For example, your ex's parents liked you and you're on good terms? Call them and ask if you can sleep on their couch for a few days until you figure something out.\n\n5. While you're living on someone else's dime, in a place that isn't yours, friends, family, shelter, whatever it is, try you best to be on your best behavior.  That means:\n - Try to avoid drugs and alcohol. If you need help with substance abuse, please reach out to some of the resources linked above.\n - Try to respect any rules of the household or establishment and stay out of trouble.\n - Keep your space clean and maintain your personal hygiene.\n - Try to avoid being a negative presence.\n\n6. It may be very difficult to find a better option, especially on short notice, but living and sleeping on the street is very dangerous, especially as a teenager. **Contact one of the above help lines and they will help you find a safe place to sleep.**\n\n## United States\n\nIf you're 16 to 24, [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov) is another option worth investigating (some adults with documented disabilities above the age of 24 are also accepted). Under the age of 18, you will need the approval of a parent or guardian.\n\nJob Corps offers free education and vocational training, dormitory-style housing, food, work clothes, and other resources to help prepare youth for independent living and the opportunity to learn skills needed for a job that's somewhat better than an unskilled minimum-wage job. It's completely free for those that qualify and are accepted into the program.\n\n# Preparing if you think you might be kicked out or may need to leave soon\n\n1. Try to avoid accelerating the process and use any time you have to save up money and prepare. Your own safety comes first, though.\n\n2. Try to make sure you will have a place to stay. If you can sleep on a couch for a month and save up more money before renting a room, do it. You want to save up money as much as reasonably possible.\n\n3. Try to have your birth certificate, identification, passport, diplomas and anything else you will need. Store important documents at the home of a trusted friend or family member if possible. Note that your parent(s) or guardian aren't obligated to give you their copy of certain documents and you should not put yourself at risk to retrieve these because you can order a copy later ([link for United States](https://www.usa.gov/replace-vital-documents)).\n\n4. Plan for the worst case even though it might not happen. Your parents may not support you going to school, fill out financial aid paperwork for you, etc. If you can't afford to pay for school on your own, you may need a different plan for continuing your education such as going to community college while working.\n\n5. If and when you need to spend money for a place to stay, try to spend as little money as possible on rent. That usually means renting a room instead of an apartment, having some roommates, etc.\n\n# Financial Accounts\n\n- Joint bank accounts can be emptied by either account holder at any time so if you're old enough to open your own bank account (18 or 19 in the United States), open a new bank account *at a different bank* from the one used by your family. [Local credit unions, online banks, and online credit unions are popular recommendations here. Use a local credit union if you will need to deposit cash.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions)\n\n- If you're not old enough to open an account where you live, see if an adult that you trust will help open a joint bank account with you. When you are old enough to open your own account, open one as soon as possible and transfer your money over.\n\n- Sign up for electronic statements and consider using a different postal address (e.g., the address of a friend or trusted adult) so statements don't get delivered to your home.\n\n- If you're having trouble finding an bank or credit union that will allow an adult that isn't a parent or guardian to open an account with you, the [Money account](https://www.capitalone.com/bank/checking-accounts/teen-checking-account/) offered by Capital One 360 is one option in the United States.\n\n- [Check your credit report](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ad5f5h/30day_challenge_1_get_on_top_of_your_credit/) and [freeze your credit](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) (sign up for credit monitoring before freezing your credit).\n\n# School\n\n## United States\n\nIf you're still in high school, ask a guidance counselor or principal at your school about continuing your education. The McKinney-Vento Act is a federal law that mandates the right of students regardless of their housing status. The law provides resources and support including provide transportation, free meals, and other services.\n\nIf you have questions about Federal student aid, and are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless read [this guide from the Department of Education](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/homeless-youth.pdf).\n\n# Other resources\n\n- /r/almosthomeless\n- /r/homeless\n- [PF Wiki: Advice for high school students and teenagers](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/teachme)\n\n# Edits\n\nI made many edits based on all of the really helpful feedback. Thanks especially to /u/BettaTesting for [these ideas](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/bgv0wy/what_to_do_if_youve_been_kicked_out_of_your/elo8kk1/) and /u/Nilpunk9 for [this suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/bgv0wy/what_to_do_if_youve_been_kicked_out_of_your/elnz2vw/).",

            "comment": "I went through several versions of this before finally posting it. Over time, I've shifted this to more of a \"this is above our pay grade\" approach with links to resources and information. I ultimately decided against including advice on car living, vagabonding, etc. because it's a little too off-topic and those are not really safe or good options for most teenagers (even older teenagers).\n\nWhile this isn't focused on advice for older adults (ages 20+) in this situation, some of the same resources like the Crisis Text Line and 211 can be helpful in the US (I haven't researched this for other countries).\n\nIf there are resources you think I should be including here, please let me know in this thread! I'm hoping to eventually include this in the wiki as a resource everyone can link as needed.\n\nP.S. Thanks /u/ejly for the feedback!",

It's a lot more of a gray area about whether it's bad enough to warrant moving out, but just because someone isn't being physically abused doesn't mean that \"it's not that bad\" or \"you just need to try harder to get along with them.\" People should maybe encourage them to wait until they are more financially secure (like in the OP) but still help them set themselves up to get out ASAP.",

I waited until graduating college (they paid for it) to cut ties with my family and so much of my life and health improved literally within days/weeks of no longer being under their influence. I don't regret waiting until finishing my degree, but all the people telling me that I should just try to make up with them and not be so \"drastic\" made it all the harder for me to reconcile the fact that they *were* abusive and didn't deserve to have a relationship with me if they weren't going to change anything about how they treated me. I've mostly gotten over it now and just roll my eyes when people say \"They're your parents! They love you and just want what's best for you!\" but when I was still in the situation and was trying to reassure myself that I was doing the right thing, those kinds of comments made it all the harder, so it really bothers me to see people giving that kind of \"advice\" to other young people going through similar situations.",

They give GED classes for those that haven't graduated high school, drivers education for those without drivers licenses, life skills classes and then of course the job training &amp; certifications that is their primary focus. All that free for those that qualify; the US Department of Labor is paying around ~30-40k per young person in program.\n\nIt is a great way to escape homelessness or a bad home environment.

Being an independent tool you are 24 means your financial aid (grants and loans) take in account for your total Estimated Family Contribution. If you are kicked out during that time, it may be worth it to explain your case to your college financial aid counselor. At the Uni I attend, there is a form titled Dependency Override. If I didn\u2019t hear about this, I would have never stayed in college- things became affordable and I am able to work myself through college",

OP touched on this under \"Options to Consider\", but didn't specifically cite things like coming out. It's super important to come out, especially to bigoted people who think they have never met a queer person before. HOWEVER, immediate personal safety is more important than making a stand here. It sucks, I know, and ideally, it would be a non-issue. But the reality is that some parents have decided it's unforgivable. They are totally wrong, of course, but you need to take care of yourself and survive long enough to find the queer family that is out there waiting for you. \n\nThere are resources out there specifically for you. If your city has an LGBT center, you can contact them. They should have a youth coordinator who can give you resources for safe places and that kind of things. You're especially vulnerable to things like substance abuse and being taken advantage of, because our community has some really shitty people amongst all the amazing ones. Be really wary of adults who aren't affiliated with an LGBT center, school, church, or other community organization. We have predators in our community. I hate saying that, but it's true. Don't use hook-up apps to find a place to stay. You have to be even more on-guard than straight kids. \n\nStay safe, lil sibs.",

I contemplated running away before 18 due to an abusive home life, but ultimately ended up staying because I needed a place to live while I worked to save up enough money to leave. I worked constantly the summer after I turned 18, hardly eating and saving every penny I made.\n\nI saved up enough money to pay my deposit on an apartment I shared with two other people, my first semester of community college classes, and my first month\u2019s rent. Since then (three years ago), I\u2019ve been on food stamps, paid my rent with a credit card once or twice, and in general, have really felt the pinch of not having enough money, but I regret nothing because there is no better feeling than freedom.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget the first day I moved away from home- I drove three hours to my new apartment, moved in, and then I just drove out into the countryside, windows down, feeling like I was a bird let out of its cage. \n\nI tell this story for two reasons. \n\n1, to reinforce the advice given in the original post. I 100% endorse trying to work things out until you can make it on your own. I wish I would have had this advice when I was 18.\n\n2. To let any teens reading this, just know that it does get better, you can do it, and it\u2019s worth it to make it on your own \n\nWhile I still believe that the majority of young people have a good home life, the fact that there are many who don\u2019t is a fact that shouldn\u2019t be ignored. When you have lived it, you understand that for the person enduring the situation, it doesn\u2019t matter how many other people have experienced it. It hurts. It\u2019s hard.

You will need them not only if you want to continue education, but also if you ever want to work at a school.    \n\nCOLLEGE: When coming from an abusive home, when it comes to financial aid for school, it may be best to just wait until you are over 25 and can get away with not putting your parents' info on financial aid paperwork/FAFSA.    \n\nHonestly, if you came from an abusive situation (even if it was just verbally/mentally abusive), you will need time to just get your shit together, have a safe place to live and let your brain rest from the trauma. Just work, save some money and don't worry about school for a while as that is just added stress. It really is ok to get a degree later. From personal experience, school was just too overwhelming for me once I got out of that toxic home life even though I had been an excellent student in high school. Having a steady job is always going to look good on a resume anyway.    \n\nMy state university has a discounted tuition program for full time employees. Others may have this as well. It should be listed under their HR page when they talk about benefits. I would highly recommend working at a college and taking advantage of this as I literally paid more for my books than my classes. It's a great way to continue education part time when you can't get financial aid from your parents.   \n  \nAlso, if the parent is abusive and controlling, it is best to invent answers to online security questions. Your parents usually know which street you grew up on, your mother's maiden name, the name of your first pet, etc. Invent a different history for yourself to use on forms like this so you can remember to keep the answers the same. The only time I have ever used my real mother's maiden name is on federal paperwork like the FAFSA (which you still need to fill out to get aid no matter how old you are).   \n\nAnd once you are on your own, paying bills, renting your own place, remember the public access info websites are going to start gathering information on you. Sites like whitepages, intelius, etc. Get in the habit of monitoring those and opting out if you find yourself on there. Coming from an abusive/controlling home (children of narcissists get this a lot) you will find the abusive parent showing up at your doorstep even after years of no contact. It sucks, but sometimes you have to live like you're in witness protection.   \n\nI also want to stress if the situation isn't physically abusive to stay as long as you can. I know one year, two years, four years seems like a LONG time but if you are not being forced out it really is so much easier to just put up with the nonsense for a little while longer until you are legally an adult and done with high school. So much easier and safer.",

This happened to me and I didnt know about any of these resources, I really wish I had known who to ask for help and I would have been so much better off if I hadn't let my pride get in the way.\n\nI was kicked out while I was still in high school in small town Missouri because of a fight between myself and my stepmother over her treatment of my sister that nearly came to blows. It resulted in me being told to get my shit and leave that night.  I had a small pickup truck into which I loaded all that I owned and drove off into the night.  I was so scared and lost and angry that all I did for hours was pick a random direction and drive.  I had a part time job and some money but it wasnt enough to find a place to crash and I didnt really have any friends at school since I was still the new kid, so I ended up living in my truck for about a week while still making it to school.  \n\nIn that time I got myself on the free lunch program and started the process to become an emancipated minor, ignoring my dad's frequent phone calls and leaving his texts unread.  I lived in my shitty old pickup and ate, showered, and changed clothes at the school.  No one there but the guidance counselor and the administration knew anything.\n\nEventually I scraped together enough money for the lowest rent place I could find, I knew I couldn't hack the Missouri winter without some kind of shelter.  I got into this run down old trailer where I could afford the rent but nothing else, no utilities no internet and no food, everything I ate was still from the school cafeteria. At least until I started picking up more hours at work.  This whole period was a struggle, I was cold and hungry all the time, alone and scared for the future.  Eventually one of my coworkers caught on to what was going on with me and basically demanded I rent a room from their house.  They only charged a minuscule fraction of what they could have asked for and it was enough to help me finally get my feet under me in a warm place with support and friendship... I have no doubt that if it hadn't have been for them I would be in a much much worse place now.\n\nNever be afraid to ask for help, be willing to fight for yourself, and please, please listen to the resources available for you.  You cant count on luck and the charity of strangers.",

They must give you 30 days notice from the time they tell you that you have to leave until they are allowed to make you.\n\nThe important thing to know is to know your rights. Of course it will suck living in a situation like that for another month but that will allow you to make plans rather than to be out the door and trying to find a place or going to a shelter or sleeping in your car.\n\nThey also can't just put your things outside or dispose of them often times if you are being forced out and not giving notice and leaving on your own accord.\n\nYou should also be allowed to return to get your things. The local police should be able to accompany you to keep the peace. Only take what you absolutely need. If your parents have given you something as a gift they may want to not let you take it even if it is important to you. Don't argue with them over things. Just get in, get what you need and get out. Maybe they will be decent enough to let you go back again and get the remainder of your things but they also may be petty and vindictive. Be prepared with the necessary things like boxes and the right vehicle to transport your things. You may want to bring some help but probably keep them outside to help load things.\n\nOf course this all varies by country, state, province, city, town, etc. There should be some legal services that you can access to be informed of your rights. Google is a good starting resource.\n\nThey may also have to use the legal / justice system to get you out of the house - like evicting you.\n\nI am not a lawyer so none of this is intended to be ke advice. Situations will vary greatly based on where you live. I have not been through this process myself so I can't offer any personal experience or advice.",

Particularly in learning skills to find work and manage money.\n   \nI eventually moved back home after some negotiations.\n   \nI hope the information on this post reaches the people who need it and if anyone who is reading my comment in this situation I can assure you it happens to a lot of people and through hard work and time you will achieve your independence. And when its over you will come out a stronger person!",

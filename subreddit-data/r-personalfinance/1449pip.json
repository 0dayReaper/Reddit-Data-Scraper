I\u2019ve heard of index funds and using that to grow money that otherwise would sit still gaining negligible interest in the bank..but what are they, how do they work, how do you choose which to invest in? Feeling like a \u201cbaby adult\u201d, so please share with me your knowledge. TIA \ud83d\udc95",

You choose the one you want to buy based on what you want.",

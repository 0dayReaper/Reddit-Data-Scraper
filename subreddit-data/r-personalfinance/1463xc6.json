    "postText": "Wife and I together make just over 88k. And soon to be over 100k come September. 32 years old. Credit card monthly minimum payments between the both of us total $700. Car payments $438. My truck only has $2000 left on the loan. Oh then I bought a travel trailer $230 a month.. which I\u2019ve tried to sell but to no avail. Wife car has 7k left. But all low interest. Between 2k rent, 2 kids food, clothes, diapers, and then bills barely have any left over after trying to pay off more than monthly minimums on CC. I just don\u2019t know where to go from here.. not to mention students loans come back shortly",

List every single thing you\u2019ve spent money on the last month or two and categorize it so you can see where it\u2019s going.  \n\nFrom there you can figure out what to cut.  Obviously try harder to sell the travel trailer.  Cut what you can and put every other cent towards paying down the high interest credit cards first.   If possible; look for a cheaper place to live, try to cut down to one vehicle.  \n\nMost of all; credit cards.  That minimum payment is what, around $28k owed? \nYou might need to cut the cards and start living with cash or debit.  Thats out of control.",

Your situation is desperate enough that saving 10 dollars here and there will make a huge difference to you.  \n\nGet extreme with cost savings measures, like saving on water, electricity, and gas.",

I believe getting to $100k puts you in a higher tax bracket but I\u2019m not 100% sure. There\u2019s also pretax stuff that will affect what they are going to see in their bank account each check like 401k contributions and such.",

            "comment": "Honestly, I've been there. And my best advice is to stop using the credit cards and pay cash / debit for things. $700/ month in minimum credit card payments is insane. \n\nIt's not for forever, but tighten the budget for a couple months to stop going more into debt. Keep up with the minimum payments (without adding any more debt) and you mentioned that in September, you'll have more income to pay debts off. That will free up some room in your budget. \n\nIt's going to be okay. And best of all, the kids won't even notice the difference. It's summer time, so pack a picnic and take the kids to the park / beach for free. Have backyard BBQs with friends + family. Focus on simple low cost things for a bit, while you get your budget together and chip away at this debt.\n\nIt's going to be okay. \u2600\ufe0f",

Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors.",

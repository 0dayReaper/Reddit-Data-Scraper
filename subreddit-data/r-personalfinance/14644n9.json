    "postText": "I currently have a 2010 mustang that i can sell for $5400 - the biggest reason i am selling is bc my a/c sometimes work sometimes doesn\u2019t and i live in Miami. A/c can not\nBe fixed bc engine computer is broken and not being produced for this model anymore. The biggest reason i dont want to buy is financials - i have about $120k in stocks and $20k cash, if i buy i think i would buy in cash bc interest rates are so high. I found this 2021 mustang ecoboost premium convertable for $27k, i am getting it inspected on Monday. But i still am not sure if i should buy it or just deal with my current cars a/c condition and invest that $20k in stocks as well. I guess this is a bit of a financial question but i still would like to hear the opinion of car enthusiasts. Because i really want this new car but my frugal financial mind is saying dont do it.",

Try ebay, offer up and then look up some mustang forums. U can even search on fb sales as well as facebook groups for mustangs. We even have mustang forums here on reddit. With that kind of money you can buy a 2019 mustang GT with under 30k miles",

    "postText": "Is my current approach of reducing my 401k contributions to only match my employer's contribution and pausing contributions to my Roth IRA while aggressively building an emergency fund that covers 6months of my living expenses (which previously was not in place), after that goal is met i will be gradually reallocating funds towards my Roth IRA and adjusting the investment strategy for my emergency fund to be less aggressive, the right choice for managing my saved money effectively?\n\nbefore this i put a little in each but it was a slow process and I was not maxing my Roth IRA",

Contribute any extra to Roth IRA.\n\n4.  If Roth maxed out, contribute more to your 401k, or live a little.",

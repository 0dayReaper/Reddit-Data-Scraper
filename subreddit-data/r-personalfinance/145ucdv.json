    "postText": "I\u2019ll start off by saying this car is definitely the biggest mistake of my life. \n\nA few years ago, I signed a loan with my boyfriend (at the time) for a car, and we are both on the title as co owners. Recently, our relationship ended and it was not amicable. He became physically abusive but there was not enough evidence for police to do anything about this. \n\nNow, he is straight up not paying for the car. I have moved out and he has the only key to the car. Obviously I do not want to pay the past due balance for a car I don\u2019t have access to, but I also don\u2019t want my credit to be ruined because he is trying to hurt me or cannot be an adult. This isn\u2019t the first time he hasn\u2019t paid the car payment either, there are multiple payments with my name on it due to his irresponsibility. \n\nI would like to know if there\u2019s a way to force him to give up ownership of this vehicle so I can take over ownership and the loan and pay the car note while also being the only person with access to the vehicle. \n\nSorry if this is not the appropriate subreddit.",

You really only have two choices here 1).  Continue to pay for the vehicle yourself and try to eventually sell the vehicle together or 2).  Stop paying it and let the car get repossessed, taking the massive hit to your credit in the process.  \n\nYou both own the car, so you both own it equally.  I would hate for you to have to try and interact with a potentially dangerous person to try and negotiate an out for this, but that\u2019s really your only option besides just not paying for it anymore.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019ve been wanting to consolidate some CC debt, well along with that I have like 2k is schooling I\u2019d like to pay off as well but reading into the terms it says you cannot use the loan to pay off post secondary education expenses. My question is, how would they know if they dump the money into your bank account? Getting a personal loan from Amex and using it for debt and schooling has me confused how they would know if it mixes with your current money.",

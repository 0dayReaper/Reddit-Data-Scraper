    "postText": "I'm curious about current state of housing market. \n\nHome prices doubled from 2019/2020 until June 2022. Then when interest rate started going up there was a minor dip and home prices are back to 2022 levels or more. During this time interest rate has gone up to 7%. \n\nSo basically a house that sold for 350k at 3% mortgage rate, is now going for 650K or more at 7% rate. A &gt;3 times decrease in affordability in 3 years or less. \n\nAccounting for inflation and shortage of inventory also it is way overpriced. \n\nRental vacancy rates are going up across the country. Too many rental units possibly. \n\nI see houses listed at extreme prices and getting sold in couple of weeks. A lot of these same houses were listed for rent for several months and there were no takers despite multiple price cuts.\n\nConsumers and renters are giving in and giving up any potential leverage just because of being impatient. \n\nJust because we can afford the house doesn't mean it's correctly priced. Would you pay 10k for an iPhone today, just cause you can afford it? Or 10k a month bill for water in your neighborhood? Water is in fact needed to survive but you would rather move, cause it's not value for money. \n\nI am just curious- Why are YOU as a home buyer still making these exorbitant offers above price? Why not wait? Why not move? Why not wait for a little cool down? Why are you ok spending 50% or more of your income on housing payment? Do you know that house will require maintenance? Do you know that bills will not go down? Do you know that property taxes and insurance will only rise? Do you know that hoarders cannot keep holding on to empty houses forever? Why do you think a home is worth 3 times or more (accounting for both price and interest increases) in less than 3-4 years. \n\nThis may sound like rant to many people, but it's not. It's genuine curiosity. We have been looking for homes in Austin for 6 months since we moved here and these are just my observations.\n\nEdit: getting a lot of backlash from landlord and sellers. I get it market wouldn't be where it is if people aren't buying. Thats not my question. My question is to BUYERs. My question is why do you think these prices are justified.",

Even if it's by choice, moving is a time consuming, expensive, and stressful event.\n\n3. In addition to number 2, the intangible benefit of certainty in one's living situation is difficult to attach a price to.

You're also using an incredibly generous investment rate and suppressed annual rental increase.\n\nIn the DC metro area that I'm in, a $600,000 home will net you a much better standard of living than what $2500 will provide. $600,000 will get a single family home 10 miles from DC, whereas $2500/mo rent will only get a townhome 20 miles outside. So not necessarily comparing apples to apples for buy vs rent. To some, this won't make a difference, but to others, that 4th bedroom is very necessary such as for families.\n\nAdjusting the rent to more accurately reflect what a $600,000 home would rent for, $3000 (which is a very conservative estimate, most I'm seeing are $3300+), buying comes out ahead in under 5 years.\n\nAnother more issue with the zillow calculator is there's no slider to account for inflation. Even a 6% interest rate is a great hedge against inflation if someone is financing $480,000 of the purchase. These benefits increase the lower the down payment gets as well. \n\nAnd one more thing: these calculators assume you're investing 100% of the savings (which you won't necessarily know the exact amount). People are terrible savers. People also have terrible discipline. If someone can figure out how much they're saving exactly each year by renting and invest that over the course of 30 years, I'll eat my shorts. That's a fantasy, circular cow, best case scenario. So account for the natural imperfection of a person's inability to save, and that pushes the scale even more towards buying. \n\nAlso, once again, these calculators fail to reflect the *emotional* aspect of buying a home. A primary residence isn't an investment. It will likely appreciate, but the moment you start using metrics to analyze investments on purchases that aren't meant to be investments, you're approaching the question wrong.\n\nSomeone might value: 1. Owning their destiny, rather than living under the whim of a property manager. 2. Not needing to move every few years. 3. Not worrying about lease renewals spiking the rent price. 4. Not worrying about needing to move if the lease raises the rent. And many other emotional aspects of home ownership that isn't reflected in a rent vs buy calculator.",

Correct to 7% (my quoted rate), and you get buying will never be cheaper.\n\nS&amp;P average return past 50 years is over 10%. \n\nThe $2500 is literally what I pay for something that would easily sell for 650k in my area. I know I have a good deal, but it what similar to comparables when we were shopping 2 years ago. I don't think its ridiculously cheap.\n\nI don't think inflation will be anywhere close to above 6% with the Fed fighting it so actively.\n\nYour last point about whether a person will invest their savings depends on the person.\n\nI can put it this way: If you have 7% interest on a $600,000 loan, it will take ten years for your monthly INTEREST payment to be less than $3000. That is money burnt akin to renting. Factor in other home costs such as taxes, insurance, PMI, home repairs, etc. Even without investing the delta, renting is an attractive option. These prices are unsustainable and OP is right that it only makes sense to buy right now if you pay 100% cash.",

We all account for increase in rent but not on property taxes and insurance cost. Plus, the cost of repairs at around 1% of property prices.\n\nRent increase might be higher on average possibly. But over a long term not by much. Start of covid was different as people were trying to move. Build new families. \n\nHere is the rental vacancy trend in US . Look at last 1 year.\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRVRUSQ156N\n\nIf despite this people are paying 50% more for rent every year then they are being exploited. \n\nRight now home price and interest rate both have doubled and surprisingly even buyers are ok with it.",

Market prices are a function of both supply and demand. Supply is low; demand is high.\n\n&gt; A house that sold for 350k at 3% mortgage rate, is now going for 650K or more at 7% rate.\n\nA house for 650K in NYC or the Bay Area is a dumpster wreck. A house for 650K in Austin is a decent or better home. \n\nSomeone who sold out a home worth a million plus in one of these HCOL areas is sitting with cash; the 7% mortgage rate doesn't affect them, nor the fact that the price by Austin standards is higher.\n\n&gt; Rental vacancy rates are going up across the country. Too many rental units possibly. \n\nPossible. What about rental vacancy rates in Austin?\n\nI found an overall \"Texas\" rate from the Fed for the state as a whole\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TXRVAC\n\nFrom about 9.5% in 2019 DOWN to 7.8% in 2022; at a time when real estate has gone up, and presumably a fair number of homes have been added.\n\nAt this point of time - the rentals that are vacant are probably those that have severe issues and aren't exactly a good living choice.\n\n&gt; A lot of people willing to buy at high prices... A &gt;3 times decrease in affordability in 3 years or less. \n\nBoth of these are your statements. From YOUR perspective : it's less affordable. For a lot of OTHER people : it's still affordable; maybe even more, if they made a lot of money through the stock market rise between 2019 and 2022.\n\nCouple that with the fact that inventory is low; it will take a lot of time for new inventory to increase supply; and almost all the new inventory is higher priced homes anyway; there aren't many lower priced / starter home developments.",

In 1995 what do you think suburban America was saying when homes once going for $125,000 were selling for $225,000? There was the same crop of people then were saying \u201ctoo high\u201d. \u201cClinton will kill the economy\u201d. By purely rationale anyone not buying at every moment in history is completely illogical. They stopped making land billions of years ago. Demand is endless supply limited. \n\nThat scenario from 1994 jumped to close to $400,000 when home prices crashed 25-30%. So the 225,000 dropped back to $300,000 in the worst real estate crash in the nation\u2019s history. There\u2019s no logical explanation except fear of the anomaly. Why do I go outside? Because I don\u2019t believe an asteroid is going to hit me today. Well it could hit you tomorrow. Sure could, but I like playing averages.",

This is going to keep inventories low in addition to people who bought houses at &lt;3% rates not moving. New house building is not as profitable for developers compared to huge apartment complexes so new inventory will remain low. All signs point to housing costs remaining high. Simply telling everyone to not buy because houses are too expensive is not going to lower prices. A major economic fallout or new legislation limiting ownership by foreign investors and hedge funds is the only way out of the housing crisis. Soon most of America will be like all overpopulated cities where buying a tiny condo in a high rise at exorbitant prices is your only option.",

Nope, they have continued to climb.\n\n3. Everyone said the insane population increase in my area would level out VERY, VERY soon.  Nope, people are still moving here (Florida) in droves.\n\n4.

Everyone said that my home purchase was a mistake, and I would be better off renting for the foreseeable future.  NOPE.  I made a VERY, VERY good decision to get a house when I did.\n\nThe bottom line is that I can spend 1800 - 2000 a month for a shitty 1 bedroom apartment.

Things are gonna get worse before they get better.  And in my state of Florida, I dont think they are going to get better.  Every other day I have friend (who tried to talk me out of buying a home) complaining about a 20-30 percent hike in rent prices.  Yeah, I need to be concerned with rising insurance rates, but that will pale in comparison to the astronomical rent increases.  And at the end of the day, I FUCKING OWN THIS.  This is mine.

That\u2019s a doubling nearly every 3 years. \n\nWe look out west and Canada. A few years ago $700,000 for a modest home seemed extreme. That modesty is now over a million. I\u2019m on the east coast. Modesty was $400,000 now $650,000 to $700,000. The question regarding price comes down to 2 things. Supply and Demand (thing 1), and costs of alternative. I\u2019m a landlord and I keep my rents below fair market value because I like workable tenants that stay. If I were to get market rent, the value proposition tilts HEAVILY in my favor. Regardless of cost, your own autonomy and comfort of your own home Vs renting something less than that from me, the costs just don\u2019t favor renters. \n\nIt may take a while to pay off that mortgage, but with life expectancy so much greater than in the past, a 40 year mortgage will become commonplace to encourage affordability, but to say prices are \u201ctoo high\u201d is really just you viewing the scenario from your own biased lense. As an investor I can tell you prices are higher than in the past, but alot of these prices still hold value. I don\u2019t fear going underwater.",

Doubled 4.6 times so doubled in roughly 16 years historically from your example. \n\nWhen you do projections, you'll likely do it for a longer term than 5 years ,accounting for other variables such as interest rate, inflation, and wages, too. \n\nBut people on personal finance sub will downvote correct maths and interpretation and will upvote wrong numbers and interpretation and assumptions.",

Homes appreciate. You could\u2019ve assumed a crash at any point in time during that 70 years and you would\u2019ve been correct ONE time.",

            "comment": "You're assuming these hot real estate markets are overpriced, when quite possibly they were way underpriced before the pandemic when everybody wanted to live there but couldn't work remotely so couldn't move far from their employer. We moved last year to a hot market where prices had jumped 2x since pre-pandemic (and paid over ask because of other offers). But you have to look at quality of life and price per square foot for what you're getting. Even after the 2x jump, our new city in the Midwest is less per square foot compared to our old east coast metro area for the same quality of house; schools are much better; crime and traffic are much lower; and there's much more to do with events, festivals, parks, trails, and general quality of life overall.\n\nI think the country's just seeing a formerly artificially-constrained housing market leveling out regionally now that large numbers of people are no longer tied to their employer's location. It looks like Austin, TX metro area as of May of this year [averages $276 per square foot](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?eid=1138280&amp;rid=462) which is in line with other comparable areas, and still quite a bargain compared to northern coastal CA at $800-900 per square foot, or Bridgeport, CT at $392. Is their quality of life and what they offer really that much better than Austin? I'd suggest you're still getting a good deal at Austin's current prices.",

            "comment": "For me, being sort-of in the housing market is also an emotional decision in wanting to combine households with my partner. I'd much rather purchase prices/interest rates be lower, but the flip side will be that our current houses are also at peak values. So hopefully that levels out.\n\nGenerally - every person who's sat out the housing market from ~2017 until now because \"the market is overheated and due for a crash and that's when I'll buy\" is either still waiting or gave up and got in at a price higher than it would have been if they'd just bought when they could have instead of trying to time the market.\n\nIf you want me to argue there's not a certain element of the housing market that feels like a confidence game full of people convincing one another that the same asset is worth more and more money for no particularly clear reason, I won't. And the rug can pull out from under me tomorrow and a $600k house might be worth $550k in a year if the market crashes.\n\nBut nobody has truly been able to time that with accuracy/reliabilty yet. And hopefully my buying decision on a long term asset is built around what I can responsibly handle in good times and bad. Buying high isn't terrible if you're going to keep the house through a downturn, because the overwhelming evidence is that like an investment account - a long enough horizon will get you back in the green.",

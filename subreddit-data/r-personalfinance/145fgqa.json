    "postText": "Update: I\u2019ve paid off my CC debt with my EF and plan to build it up as fast as possible. Thank you for the advice all.\n\nGood afternoon,\n\nI have never had good money habits and I've started building an emergency fund. Some say 8 months is good so I have been working on that. \n\nI currently have 8K allocated to the fund but the main issue is I accrued a good amount of debt over the past couple of months. It is around the size of my emergency fund (because of my poor spending habits) from eating out, getting a dog, and some other life things in general. I was doing well for a while. Paying off my credit card every month, so I do have my income allocated correctly. I just chose to spend more than I should have. \n\nMy main question is do I chip away at the debt slowly? Do I stop allocating to the emergency fund and allocate what's allotted (900) every month so I can destroy that debt sooner? Or do I pay off my debt with my emergency fund and start anew? My job is very stable in the sense only death or committing a felony would get me fired.",

Have you fixed the underlying spending problem?\n\nPaying down the debt as much as possible by reducing your emergency fund is probably the right call. You probably shouldn't even have let the emergency fund get so large while taking on so much debt.",

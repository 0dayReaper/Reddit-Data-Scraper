Through Remitly, I can send the money, but I want to know if there is any downside of using my Chase Sapphire Preferred Credit card for it ?? The Remitly has 3% fee for it which is fine for it. I am doing this for Sign up Bonus and I have only 25 days to spend the money. Will this cause for advance cash fee by Chase card??",

If you've not been able to qualify with your normal expenses (utility bills / purchases etc.) - look at other options. Try posting in r/churning for suggestions on how to use this balance and qualify.",

    "postText": "Old 401K with Assent Management Company 1 (AMC1), Current 401K is with AMC2. IRA accounts are with AMC3. I think a little consolidation would be nice and I am just unsure of how to best go about it. Appreciate y'alls help!  \n\n\nCurrent Income of \\~170K annually\n\n\\--6 Figures sitting in an old 401k.  It is split 75% Roth Contributions and 25% Employer Safe Harbor Profit Sharing. I think that means those employee contributions were done as pre-tax, Traditional. \n\n\\--I have maxed out my IRA contributions for this year.\n\n\\--Current employer 401K plan is nice and on track for max contribution. However, not sure how much longer I will be at my current role/company. \n\nWhat is the appropriate next step--rollover into IRA, or into my current 401K plan?",

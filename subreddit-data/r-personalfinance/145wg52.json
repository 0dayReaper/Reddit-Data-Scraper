    "postText": "I live overseas and am going on a trip with the family. I have secured free housing for all of us (in exchange for a job I\u2019m doing), but I have to rent a car for the trip. The rental is about $400 for the trip.\n\nNow, my brother-in-law wants to go on this trip with us, which I\u2019m happy about. The thing is, we need to rent a bigger vehicle (5 seater to 7 seater) if he comes, which brings the cost up to $1200.\n\nHow do we split the cost? 50/50, or we pay $400 and he pays $800?\n\nMy thoughts on it: \n- We would only have to pay $400 if he didn\u2019t come.\n- He isn\u2019t paying for housing (but neither are we because I was able to secure free housing in exchange for a job I\u2019m doing)\n- He is single and makes 3x the salary of us.\n\nMy wife thinks we should split it 50/50, I think we should split it 400/800.\n\nWhat does Reddit think?",

Let him know that it doesn\u2019t make sense financially as you\u2019d have to upgrade your car. \n\nYou\u2019re already providing free housing. He can get a car and some people can ride with him if they want. \n\nDepending on how long the trip is, the extra car will come in handy.",

Sometimes the car rides together are a big part of the experience.\n\nAs an extreme example, in Yellowstone you\u2019re probably spending half of your days in the car. It would be lame to relegate OP\u2019s brother in law to be alone for all that, when they\u2019re taking a vacation together.",

The amount of space in a 7 passenger car isn\u2019t enough for 6 people\u2019s worth of luggage. For less money you provide more room for passengers and luggage respectively at less cost. If this trip is such a burden that your brother in law can\u2019t pay $400 for his own car, he has zero business going. Brother in law won\u2019t be alone. Kids will want to go with kids. A couple go in car A, next time they go in car B. One car can be quieter than the other. Frankly I\u2019d be pissed if that many people wanted to pile into a single car and would personally pay the money for 2 if the brother in law couldn\u2019t afford it. That\u2019s just my take on travel. I\u2019d always spend a hair more for comfort than not. \n\nIn this case, the cost is actually LESS for more comfort. Talk about a no brainer. It\u2019s all in how you sell it to him. \n\n\u201cHey X, I looked at upgrading my car to get the 7-8 passenger. Check out the cost difference. Jumps us up to $1200 for the week. Why don\u2019t we just rent 2 cars at $400? I\u2019ll get one, you get one. Saves a third of the total cost and now we\u2019ll have plenty of room and flexibility in case we need it. Thoughts?\u201d  He\u2019ll say yes and no feelings will be hurt.",

It all depends on how you feel about it, how he feels about it, and what you want to do.\n\nWhat is fair also might be altered by past events. If, for example, you all went on a vacation a year ago and he paid for none of it, it\u2019s obviously fair for him to pick up the tab this time if he can.",

Exception being If you're hurting for money you could always pull him aside and be straight up with him and see if out of the kindness of his heart he wants to volunteer to pay slightly more. Then again if you're hurting that bad I'm not sure why you would be going on vacation anyways. I wouldn't ask this though from family personally unless I was in a bad financial spot and I definitely wouldn't demand it. It doesn't matter how much he makes, he shouldn't be penalized for his career success. I'm not sure how $200 registers in your head but to me it doesn't register as a large enough of an expense to ask for more money from people, especially family",

If you like your brother in-law, then split it 50/50 and enjoy the extra space/time together. It's not worth discussion over $200 if you value the time together. If you're just putting up with him because it's family and you have to, then maybe your wife can talking with him about paying a bit extra.",

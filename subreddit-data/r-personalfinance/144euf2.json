    "postText": "Hi,\n\nMy Father sadly passed away a few months ago. I found out that he had left me as a beneficiary for his thrift savings plan. He was a retired government employee. The total amount is a little over $50k. I'm in my late-twenties and still finishing my bachelors degree. I have about a year left. I'm also going into a field that is more art driven (film) and I likely won't be making a very lucrative income after graduating (perhaps around $40k a year). I really want this money to be put to good use. I have a remaining college debt of about $22k in federal loans, which will probably be around the same after graduation. I'm currently single and don't plan to purchase a house/have kids etc. in the near future. I more so plan to live in an apartment, perhaps a shared one, for awhile until I can make a decent living. I was planning to perhaps use some of the money to help pay off my college debt, and the remaining as an emergency fund, maybe even putting withdrawals into a HYSA.\n\nI've spoken with some financial advisors, and most of them advised me to open an inherited IRA. If I withdrew the money as a lump sum into a bank account, there would be 20% withholding. But if I rolled it over into said IRA, I apparently wouldn't be taxed unless I took money out of it. I'd have to take all the money out of the IRA within 10 years however. I calculated it, and at my current tax rate (I make minimum wage currently, so about 12%), it seems that I'd lose about the same amount to taxes over time as the 20% withholding would be. That's why I wanted it to accrue interest in the IRA. Unfortunately, Merrill Lynch, who I spoke with, said I'd need to use an advisor and pay a fee at .85% annually to do so, as it, being an inherited IRA, can't be invested passively without continuously meeting with an advisor. Some of the advisors I've spoken to at Merrill also seemed a bit unknowledgeable of my situation as well, which set off some red flags in my head. But maybe I'm paranoid/have had bad luck?\n\nI was curious what would be best to do with this money so I can earn interest over time and make it useful. Would an inherited IRA be my best bet for that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you.",

    "postText": "I am in the military and they have set us up automatically with 5% taken out by default without signing up for it. We weren't provided with info on how to completely opt out. Though on my online MyPay portal I placed it down to 0% thinking that would apply. Only to see my paycheck is still short. So I found the gov site for tsp and made an account. It revealed that yes they are still taking from my paycheck and have already collected a few hundred. I looked around the site thoroughly and nowhere do I see a way to get my money back and to completely set the contribution to 0% there or to opt out completely. I realize this plan is good for some people but I am not interested in maintaining it at this time and would rather seek another retirement plan once I'm ready to start investing. At this point I would rather put this money towards current debts before looking at retirement. If anyone knows how to opt out fully and get at least most of the money back they took for it, any info would be appreciated.",

            "comment": "1% is automatic as part of the Blended Retirement System (BRS) that was new starting in 2018. The government matches your contributions on up to 5%. So if you opt out, you are leaving free money on the table! The BEST deal of investing is to go to MyPay and do 5% across the board on all your pays (base, bonus, special, etc). This maximizes the free money you will get from the government. I would recommend a Roth over Traditional for multiple reasons. Not sure you can completely opt out of the automatic 1%. But I don't know.",

Setting it to zero means a) you're throwing free money away and b) you're making it much harder for your future self to provide for yourself and your family in retirement. Yes, sure, there are things that feel much more pressing now than retirement savings. But the longer even a small amount is locked away, the more it grows. TSP has an excellent reputation.

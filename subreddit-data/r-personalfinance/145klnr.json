    "postText": "I bought an RV. Life did a 180 and I don\u2019t see myself using it in the near future. I am listing it at a loss (about 7k) I am not sure how long I should keep trying to sell it. I can afford the monthly payments, but not able to pay it down quicker and the longer I keep it the more it depreciates. My listing for this rig is the lowest in a 500 mile radius. A dealer offered to consign it but at a significant loss. A loss I cannot afford and would have to take out a loan. \n\nWorld it be better to just keep paying for it and not using it?  Or taking almost a 25k hit and chalking it up life lessons?\n\nAdvice appreciated!",

I dealt with a similar situation where I needed to sell my house during the '08 - '11 downturn. It was so painful to sell for less than I paid, but I got out of a situation that was costing me more money (monthly payments) + time and energy than I wanted to deal with.\n\nI don't know your overall life situation, but as long as you don't feel like the loss will put you in a hole you can't climb out of, sell and move on. Good luck!",

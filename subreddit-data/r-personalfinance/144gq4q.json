    "postText": "I need at least $8500 for the whole school year just to pay tuition and food, not to mention gas, activities, etc.. I just bought a used car from my aunt, which cost $2700. I just barely paid it off. My mom is charging $300 a month for rent, which I have paid for the month. \n\nI\u2019m currently looking for a new job, and with wages in my area, I am able to make at least $16/hr, most likely at least $18/hr. I messed up my gpa last semester, so I am unable to get a scholarship. \n\nMy credit score is 698 currently and I can almost guaruntee it will be above 700 in the next month or two. I\u2019m considering getting a smaller loan to cover some of the cost of college. \n\nThe fall semester starts in late August. My current expenses are about $400 a month, including gas, food, and gym membership. I have no debt. I will have $704 saved up next week. How should I go about saving my money and not spending? This seems like an impossible task and I wonder if I should just wait until the summer semester and finish my associates next year.",

This way you would have emergency fund if needed, and hopefully enough money to pay off the loan after it is due.\n\nBenefits: Credit history, emergency fund, money upfront to pay for school\n\nCons: if not disciplined would owe the money for loan",

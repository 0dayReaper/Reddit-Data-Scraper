    "postText": "Alright so due to my own negligence I got into a debt of 11k with 4 different companies now I was able to talk with chase and they were kind enough to put me in a payment plan with monthly payment reasonable enough that in couple years I will be able to pay off. The two other companies Paypal and petal there owed amounts are less than 1k so I am making more than monthly payments on it and will be able to completely eliminate hopefully this year. The third is personal loan from discover which I am also making payments on monthly on time and I am in good standing. So the problem now is discover cc where I ower 4500 and with my income and expenses I can only make a payment of max 200 a month and try to get rid of it so I call discover and they don't have any plan to pay off the balance they said that even if I close the account I will keep incurring interest and late fees so I just went ahead and closed the account. Now problem is I don't have any money to completely pay off this balance so I tried personal loan but in last few months my credit score went from 720 to now 590 and now can't get any sort of loan. Question is, is there a way where I can convert that 4500 credit balance into monthly payments without it completely destroying my credit score and I don't wanna go the route of bankruptcy or anything that extreme as I was able to get handle on my other 4 accounts but this discover is killing me so is there a way?",

Pay off the ones that put you on a payment plan. As you pay those off, start putting that same amount of money towards the Discover account.",

My score went up 100 points 2 weeks later. \n\nI diverted 50% of my checks to make it happen. Paid my car +insurance late, but within the 10 day grace period. 4500 won't take long to pay down if you pull some shit to make bigger payments. Time it right with other bill grace periods and your checks.",

    "postText": "So I\u2019m 21 and when I was around 19 I got two credit cards from chase that I recklessly spent and maxed out on. So both those cards I have a combined 2k debit on. I also have school tuition due that\u2019s around 1.6k. I got approved for a school loan for 3.5k and I can\u2019t use it unless I pay out of pocket for this tuition first before they can reimburse me. \n\nSo my question is, is there any relatively decent loan options that I can look at to pay my 2k credit card debt and also the school tuition? Once the private school loan gets reimbursed to me I\u2019ll just use it to pay a good chunk into the personal loan. \n\nWhat are my options?",

Two, I need to get the summer tuition paid asap before my classes are dropped and I can\u2019t do that unless I get a personal loan because my private loan won\u2019t reimburse me till i pay out of pocket.

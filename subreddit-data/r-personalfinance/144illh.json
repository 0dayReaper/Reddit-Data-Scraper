Within a given career trajectory there will be credentials or expertise that can enhance one's posture and profile, but it almost never makes sense (again, financially) to stop work entirely for them, unless one is truly at a dead end. And the credentials or expertise will be structured and delivered as add-ons- weekend, night, async, etc. \n\nI have known folks who have dropped everything and completely changed direction- one guy went from being an airline pilot to an ER doctor in his 40s- but they did that for happiness reasons. Often financially it winds up being detrimental (and money isn't everything).",

Which specific graduate degree fields are available to you is also unknown.  For example, a master's degree in CS could increase earnings potential substantially over average individual earnings in the US.  However, it's unclear whether your background and interest supports a grad degree in CS.\n\n* Option 1:  Do  not get graduate degree --  Earnings = ?\n* Option 2: Get graduate degree -- Cost of degree  = ?, Earnings for ? years \\~= 0?, Earnings after grad degree = ?",

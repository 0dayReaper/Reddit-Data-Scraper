If so, are there benefits buying through Vanguard rather than Fidelity? I hold some zero fee Fidelity funds that are only available through Fidelity, so I'm wondering if the same is true for Vanguard ETFs?",

I can and do buy VMFXX regularly in my ETrade account and although they definitely don't advertise it you can buy, hold and sell Vanguard funds in Etrade and there is no fee to do so.  So I went into my Fidelity app (my fidelity account is much smaller that Etrade but I do have a small account with Fidelity) and entered a trade for VMFXX.   The trade populated but on the Preview Order screen it showed me a $75 Fidelity fee for buying VMFXX.   So yes you can, but at least with a small account there will be a fee.   Larger accounts may get away without a fee.   But many brokerages will allow you to trade in Vanguard funds but with an additional fee as the Vanguard funds are skinny enough that a Broker Dealer is not going to make any money if you have nothing but Vanguard funds in your account.",

Kind of like how you can get milk from the supermarket in a plastic jug or a cardboard box carton, but you still have the same milk.\n\nETFs generally trade at most (all?) brokerages for free.\n\nMutual funds, however, may not.  Specific brokerages will often have lists of \"no transaction fee\" (NTF) funds.\n\nAt ETrade, many Vanguard mutual funds are on their NTF list.\n\nFidelity has their own list of which contains *none* of Vanguard's mutual funds.\n\nHowever, at either Fidelity or ETrade, you would be able to trade ETFs for free from any brand (ie VTI, ITOT, SCHB)",

It came as a bit of a surprise when I discovered I couldn't automate their investments.

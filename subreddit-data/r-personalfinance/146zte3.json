    "postText": "Hello,\n\nMy company offers an espp program with a 15% discount and with a one year lookback. Currently my espp is about 5k in profit but if I sell it I get a short term capital gains tax. I have been reading a lot of bogglehead forums and seems like everyone is advising against holding espp.\nMe and my wife might buy a house in a couple of years. If I do sell my espp what is the best way to save for down payment? \n1) HYSA\n2) diversification using index funds like IUSG/VOOG\n3) CDs\n4) any other options?\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nedit: there is no debt at the moment.",

            "comment": "Volatility can easily exceed the difference between short and long term capital gains.  Unless you'd normally buy shares in your company, then you should sell and do something else appropriate for the time horizon of when you'd need the money.  For a down payment HYSA and money market funds have good returns and are highly liquid.  If you want to hedge against rates going down, t-bills or CDs with an appropriate maturity date are both good choices.",

            "comment": "\"Diversification\" is probably the right angle here, like you said in the title. Does it represent 80% of your portfolio? Then you may want to diversify. 5%? Whatever.\n\nI've sold ESPP immediately to lock in the 15% discount and pay taxes at the marginal rate, and I've held onto ESPP for over a year and had the stock be both way up and way down over a 12 month period. If you hate uncertainty just treat it like a 15% guaranteed savings account, which is a heck of a deal (better in the 1% interest rate environment than this 5% environment, but still great).\n\nI don't have any great advice on the \"saving for a house\" angle, but there's others around here with much better information.\n\nEdit: if your ESPP buys shares frequently (e.g. every paycheck or monthly) and you're buying and selling, you may have to watch out for wash sale rules since you're buying and selling the same stock in short period.",

Cool job!\n\nFirst, consider whether you think your company is an above average investment or not. If you think it's terrible and really overvalued then even a 15% discount (or more) isn't gonna change that! If that's the case then you should be looking for a new job anyway.\n\nNext,  I'd try to meet the holding requirement for capital gains based on each purchase you've made and still own. At that point I would sell just the lots that satisfy the requirement and diversify if you wish with anything you listed above. Make sure you understand the requirement based on how your plan is structured. Some have overlapping or discrete purchases inside of a larger offering period while others are simpler and have a 3 or 6 month offering/purchase period.\n\nAlso note that you may need to adjust the cost basis for these shares or pay double taxes. Don't assume your tax person knows what to do, mine didn't...\n\nI sold almost immediately each time but did, near the end of my tenure, start to wait more and more to do what I recommended above. Made good money but would have made more doing this from the start of heck, even holding on to all shares but you never know...\n\nAgain, all this is predicated on the fact that you are ok with short to medium term investing in the company you work for at the amounts you're contributing.",

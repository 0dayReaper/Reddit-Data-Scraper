    "postText": "So I've researched a little on Google but haven't exactly gotten answers for my specific questions. I'm looking to open a savings/investment type of account for my baby girl. A regular savings account is easy enough, but I'd like an account where anyone could make a one-time or recurring contribution to it online. I want it to be able to accrue interest so it can build. I don't want it to be specific to college funds because who knows if that's the path she will choose. If possible, I'd also like her to be the only one who can make withdrawals (when she's old enough) so that people know she is getting 100% of that money.\nAnyone have any experience with this kind of thing? Would appreciate advice and recommendations on where to open one of these accounts!",

            "comment": "529 is generally the standard, and can be used for more than just college. Sometimes trade schools and other programs can qualify. 529\u2019s are also great because if you have 2 kids and the first doesn\u2019t go to college, you can \u201ctransfer\u201d the 529 to the second child. \n\nUTMA is another standard, but a bit more risky if your kid goes off the deep end. \n\nA trust would be another option but less tax advantaged. Family and friends can make gifts to the trusts if they want. This can help avoid taxes that exceed the gift tax exclusion amount.",

There are no contribution limits (although you could run into the ceiling for the gift tax), and anyone is eligible to open and contribute to a 529",

I have money for my kids, but its in my accounts and in 529s.\n\nhaving that savings account in their name is fun in concept only. but other than that its just a PITA to manage.",

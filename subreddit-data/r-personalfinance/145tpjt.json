    "postText": "I have two accounts with Wealthify, one is an ISA and the other is a private pension but I'm concerned that they're both performing really badly.\n\nMy current return for the ISA is -0.82% (this doesn't sound too bad but thinking about it I'm not entirely sure it hasn't been positive for a very long time). I know the pension is a long term investment (I'm 31) but similarly it's currently negative -13%, should I keep feeding it, is this really performing really badly?\n\nMy knowledge on the whole pension process is extremely limited and I can't believe they don't teach about it in school. This isn't my only pension, I do also have one through work and I pay into an AVC, so I could potentially stop paying in to the Wealthify one.\n\nEDIT: I started paying into the pension in 2021 and the ISA in 2018. \n\nIt is an ethical pension and that might make a difference.\n\nIn terms of funds I leave this all up to the auto-investor because that's the purpose of the App, again investing is something I think should be talked about more in school.",

It highly depends on what the formula is for your payout and if there is a yearly COLA.  \n  \nYou didn\u2019t state when you started this.  An S&amp;P 500 index fund like FXAIX is up ~3% for 1Yr and ~13% for 3yr, but 2022 as a whole was down -18%.  \n  \nYou should also state what funds you are buying.",

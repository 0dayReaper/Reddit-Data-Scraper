    "postText": "I have two pensions and am retiring from one of the jobs (already collecting from first job). I can get $1830 a month for the rest of my life and when I pass away my husband gets $1830 until he dies. Or I can get a monthly payment of 1050 and a lump sum of $127500 which my fidelity advisor recommended putting in a guaranteed income annuity. The difference in monthly income would be $77 less by going the annuity route. The advisor said if we should both die before the money is gone it would go to our beneficiaries. If we do the plain monthly payments and we both die in a few years our beneficiaries get nothing from the pension. I am 70 and my husband is 65. I am leaning towards the guaranteed payments. If we live into our 80s I would be getting less per month and our beneficiaries would not get anything anyway. I could take the lump sum and put in an IRA but investments have not been doing well lately. On another note my beneficiaries really don\u2019t need this money and they would get our other investments. However, I have friends who have died a few years after retiring and thn the money would be lost. Any thoughts?",

You're right about most people passing soon after retiring as it seems to be in my profession. To me it would seem a no brainer to take the lump sum either enjoy a small portion of it and/or invest it in a gic ladder or per your advisors advice.",

                    "comment": "Thank you for your reply. If I take a monthly benefit from my company, I would get a montly benefit of $1830. If I take the monthly benefit from my company plus a lump sum I would get $1056 monthly from my company and $127,252 as a lump sum. If I invest the $127,252 in an annuity, I would get a monthly payout of $695 from the annuity meaning I would get $79 less a month than if I should take my company's monthly payment. Also, because of when I will receive the payout, I would lose a month of annuity payment so $79 less a month plus missing a $695 payment. I am starting to think it may not be worth going this route. The only reason to do the lump sum was so if my husband and I pass early, there would be a benefit left for our beneficiaries.",

Currently have 5 bananas.\n\n***\n\nMy question:  \n\nDoes it matter that I bought apples at two different prices?\n\nIs this correct:\n\n*  if I just want to keep track of profits / losses, no it does not matter\n\n*  if I would need to pay taxes on profits, yes it does matter\n\nThank you!\n\n***\nedit:  typos",

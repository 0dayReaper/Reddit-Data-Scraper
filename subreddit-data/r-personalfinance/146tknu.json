I kept all my people employed thru the pandemic at a huge cost, but they got me here.  You never can predict all events which will occur. \nBe proud of your accomplishments.

Maxing out a SEP-IRA is approx 20% up to $315k-ish of income (when you max out the allowable contribution) so you would have to put 20% of your employee\u2019s salary into their SEP-IRAs. If they\u2019re making say 100k, you\u2019re talking about spending a total of 60k so that you can reduce your own tax burden by 120k (remember that as the owner of an LLC, your \u201csalary\u201d is whatever you met at the end of the year, so the 60k you put toward employee retirement reduces your tax burden in exchange for a ton of loyalty from your people). And if you\u2019re making six figures a month and this is way more than you ever made before you certainly have the wiggle room to do it versus finding assets you don\u2019t need to hide the money.  \n\nI own an LLC as well and have around 20 1099s working for me. I\u2019ve always found that investment in my workforce (raises, bonuses, perks) is always the best way to spend money. I have had virtually no turnover for the 6 years I\u2019ve owned the company. Only growth, because my people know they won\u2019t be treated as well anywhere else and that I\u2019d rather invest in them than maximize every nickel of profit I can.",

We started it when we didn\u2019t have any employees and then switched to a simple IRA ($15,500 contribution limit with 3% company match) once we hired and they were with us for 3years. \n\nDo you have a spouse that helps at all? You can do the $15,500 + company match for both of you if you do.\n\nAlso, $6,500 in traditional Ira (another $6,500 if you have a spouse\u2014 spousal IRA)\n\nIf you have a HDHP then $3850 in a HSA ($7750 if you have a family plan)\n\nYou could also consider a 401k for your business instead of a simple IRA, which would allow $22,500 contribution instead of the $15,500. \n\nWhat kind of LLC is this? Is it an s-corp?",

I just formed it, acquired a business, and it has 4 employees and 2 1099s. All have worked with the company for less than 2 years. Prior employer was horrible - minimal vacation, partial healthcare, nothing else. I upped vacation, added salary, and got comprehensive benefits. I invested in tech infrastructure and another employee.\n\nNow I am trying to see the best way to put money away pre tax - yes HSA qualifies and I will do that. \n\nI was wondering if I could hire myself as an independent contractor for the specialized work I am doing as a part time employee in addition to the work I do as running the business (completely different skill sets). I figured I could max out an SEP IRA as the contractor, then max out a simple IRA as the employer also. My soon to be wife is hired thru her company for all of the marketing/tech, so she can also max out her SEP IRA.\n\nI just didn\u2019t know if a SIMPLE IRA is best for the company, employees, etc",

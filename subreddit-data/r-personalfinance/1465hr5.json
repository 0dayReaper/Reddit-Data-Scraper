    "postText": "Me and my girlfriend are getting married in the fall and currently our plan is to get a house in the next year an a half, were currently trying to figure out what we can afford. With my job, I make just under 60k, great benefits, 401k and a company vehicle (so I don't have to pay for gas or insurance at all, which is a huge benefit). She makes 55k yearly with good benefits.  Monthly expenses : Food - 400$ Her student loans : 500$ Social outings : 300$ Rent - 1000$ Extra - 300$ Her car payment/insurance/gas - 400$ Petcare - 100$  We both have been focusing on pay down our credit cards each month and have a combined amount of 7k. \nSo currently 3000-3200$ is what were spending on average each month. We both are in our mid 20s and we both have a credit score of around 720 so hopefully well be able to get a good rate. \n\n Based on these metrics we think that a house around the 230k - 250k range for a 30 year mortgage and a 10,000$ down payment seems doable. Does that seem like a reasonable range for us to be looking into based on our finances?",

Does that comfortably fit in with your *net* monthly income (after taxes and retirement) and your projected monthly expenses? If not, you will need to increase your down payment or look at cheaper houses.\n\nAlso, are houses in your target area selling for $250k ish or was that just a plug?",

            "comment": "To be conservative your monthly mortgage payment should not exceed 30 percent of your take home pay. The rule of thumb is actually based on your gross income but by being conservative you have more wiggle room to account for homeowners insurance, possible HOA, regular maintenance, utilities, property taxes, etc. It's not just about the mortgage for home ownership.\n\nPay off your student loan debt asap using either the Avalanche or the Snowball method. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for a down payment. This will allow you to obtain a favorable mortgage rate from your lender in the future and frees up more cash for your monthly budget.",

            "comment": "I tend to be _super_ conservative on housing stuff. Personally, I like a rule where, even in a dual income home, you can afford your house if you had to live solely on a single person's income. In your all's case, that would roughly translate to housing at 1200/month or less I would think. I got that by figuring your wife's net income at about 44000, divided that by 12, and figured about a third of that.\n\nThere are two distinct advantages of following that kind of rule, if at all possible. First, you are much safer in the event something happens. If you lose your job, you guys should be ok for a while... Maybe indefinitely. And the same applies for your wife losing hers. Second, it means that you're structuring your life such that the entirety of your salary, or as close to it as possible, can go into savings. Obviously then the larger that savings pool gets, the more leeway you have for broader spending.\n\nNow it's not that simple... Like you'd ideally both be contributing to match levels in 401ks and stuff... And I understand that this pushes savings and investment at a level most would find unduly aggressive. But if you can do that, particularly when you're younger, your life and financial decisions will get easier and easier over time because you'll quickly get a solid savings/emergency fund and quickly grow your investment pools.",

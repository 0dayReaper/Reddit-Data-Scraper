Hopefully it helps someone on this Prime Day.",

They win on the convenience of Prime and the easiest shopping experience around, all the way down to returning unpackaged items for free at your local Kohls. \n\nPrice wise they are similar to Walmart in my experience. Sometimes higher and sometimes lower, but around the same on average.\n\nEdit: Lots of people asking about the Kohls thing. See below and scroll to bottom. I guess they are only doing it in LA and Chicago right now, but it is pretty amazing.\n\nhttps://www.kohls.com/feature/amazon.jsp",

And 10 minutes later I have the address for the Las Vegas  AMAZON return center. No push back at all.\n\nThat was probably a $50 shipping free they saved me from.\n\nOne thing I will say about Amazon is that their warehouse deals 'used stuff' are not the deals they used to be. ",

Hats, scarfs, sunglasses, jewellery, yarn, material, craft tools, stickers, kitchen equipment, basically if I need something I check Ali first. Clothes and shoes are a serious learning curve and I now order some nice stuff. Can take anywhere between 10 days and up to 2 months. Ali really wants to kill the reputation of stuff taking ages to turn up or not at all, I usually get a refund if there is a problem.\nEdit, Just to add, I live in a tiny shit hole that has a poor selection in local shops, has poor public transport, often stuff can turn up quicker from China than I can make it to the next big town. If you want small cost items P&amp;P can be more than the goods, on Ali it's usually free.",

Its like Aliexpress on steroids - much better quality, well-known reputable sellers, wayyyyyy larger selection and variety of goods, and way faster shipping since everything will go through superbuy (or whatever agent you use). The shoes and designer clothes you buy from there (especially with the right sellers) make the stuff on aliexpress look absolutely silly by comparison because they are nearly 1:1 with the actual retail counterparts.\n\nThere is a bit of a learning curve on figuring out the best way to browse and buy from there, but superbuy makes it easy.\n\nCheck out /r/fashionreps and /r/repsneakers for more information on where to buy and how to get started",

Not sure when it happened but their online pricing is certainly more in line with Amazon and Walmart. I ended up buying some DVD box sets for the kids from BestBuy, as they were more expensive on both Amazon and Walmart, even with their free shipping. I was very surprised! From there I compared pricing for some general electronics. BestBuy has certainly gotten much more competitive. Guess they had to if they want to stay in business",

As if the purchases being made magically don't in some way offset the need for future purchases.   Similarly, I had a high school economics teacher who would rail against coupons.  \"I wasn't going to eat at your restaurant before, why am I doing it now simply because I have a coupon.\"  *Because you were going to eventually eat food at some point, and now you can have a nice meal for 50% off.*\n\n",

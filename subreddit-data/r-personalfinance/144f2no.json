    "postText": "Hey all\n\nMarried couple (I'm 40, she's 36), two kids under 3, currently grossing $330k in HCOL. Have around $300k left on our mortgage.\n\nDebt: 76k in student loans to be paid off in the next 4-5 months\n\nEmergency fund: Currently at $40k, should north of 60k by EOY\n\nWe both max our 401k currently, as well as a Roth each. Currently our combined 401k is at around $400k\n\nWe love our home, its our first and we got a really incredible deal on it (short sale + refinance interest down during covid.) We would ideally like to find a way to keep it and rent it while moving to a slightly bigger place with better schools since our local schools are not great. \n\nI work at a company that could see some kind of exit event in the next 2-3 years, but what that payout will look like has vacillated wildly and regardless is not guaranteed. So anything that comes from that would be nice we are refocusing on figuring out with our own money.\n\nThe question we have been asking ourselves is, once the student loans are paid off and the emergency fund fulfilled where do we go from there? Our initial plan was to just continue piling money into our 401ks and Roth's, max them out and then take whatever is left over and put it into a HYSA for our second home. This would be a slower path and more contingent on my company having a significant exit event.\n\nAnother path we've been discussing is since we truly want to find a way to keep our original home while upgrading a new one, would it be wise to redirect some or all of our current 401k investments to a HYSA for a second home. If we treated that like a 401k and maxed it out at 22,500 each that would be 45k a year.\n\nWe live in a HCOL area and do not plan to move because we need to be around family. Even saving at 45k a year would mean multiple years of saving to be able to not just cover the down payment but also the the monthly mortgage. \n\nI understand that 401k vs physical assets are just different investment vehicles, but my gut feels wrong about diverting money from the 401k.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs this a viable path forward? \n\nWhat are we not considering that we should be?\n\nWhat kinds of things should I use or take into account to help us make these decisions?",

It was especially hard with young kids because I had to pay for everything to get done (vs. Doing repairs myself). I have since sold and now just push any excess to non tax advantaged account (after maxing out tax advantaged).",

My father in law did something similar when HE was younger and said things akin to what you did. Except he was actually doing the fixing, which had a non-monetary cost.",

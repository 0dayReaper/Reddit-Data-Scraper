    "postText": "I went to pick up my paycheck just now and saw it had been direct deposited into an account I don't own or have access to.  I am still on probation at this job and am not eligible for direct deposit yet and did not sign any forms.  I brought this to the attention of the office manager who immediately called the payroll company and admitted it was her mistake.  The company is refusing to issue another check until Monday - which won't deposit into my actual account until Tuesday.  I made it explicitly clear that I NEED that money today - I have all my bills set to automatically come from this check in addition to the fact I'm living check to check and don't have enough to survive on for 3 days.  I literally have $3.97 in my bank account.  Is there anything I can do?\n\n\nEDIT:  I received a call from corporate that the company is handling this TODAY, and my check should be in my account by early afternoon.  I posted this in a hurry :)  BUT thank you for all your answers, I'm realizing how awful my spending habits truly are and this may have inspired another PF post where I lay out all my debt and let you smarties help me out.   Have a great morning everyone!\n\nEdit 2: I HAVE RECEIVED MY FULL CHECK IN MY ACCOUNT.  I called every 10 mins until someone from corporate payroll handed it in, in person, at my bank.  Also, I already downloaded YNAB just now.  Stop telling me I'm irresponsible - message received but that isn't helpful.",

Within a week, I felt like a pro, and I could see the forest for the trees...I saw a path to getting our of debt, and using the YNAB program was going to be the way to do it.\n\nThat was two years ago. I am now debt free, I am not living paycheck to paycheck, I have a respectable three month emergency fund that is growing each month, my credit score is about 790, and I still budget and track my purchases with YNAB every day!",

If you enter into a contractual obligation to pay on a certain date, you damn well better honor that obligation.\n\nIf your employer screws you over, or your bank, or your mom, or whatever, doesn't matter. **YOU** are the one who signed the contract, and **YOU** are the one they will come after for compensation. They may be willing to negotiate, but they may not, and if not you are liable for the contract you signed.\n\nIf your employer or someone else wronged you and caused you to be unable to honor a debt, that debtor can come after you for compensation. Your recourse in that situation is then to go after your employer for compensation.\n\nThink of it like a chain.

And some people have it much harder than others.  \n\nIn PF we often advise people to keep living with their parents for a few \"extra\" months until they have an emergency fund saved up, perhaps as much as 6 months expenses.  Obviously, this is easier if you have parents, who you can live with, in an area where there are jobs of any sort.  Yes, it might mean living in a low rent/high crime district.  Very few places in America are really all that dangerous.  Living someplace shitty for a year isn't a death sentence.\n\nOn the other hand, a lot of people don't try very hard.  Sure, 6 months of living expenses is ideal.  3 months is good.  One month would have solved this guy's problems.  But even $500 to $1,000 solves a LOT of problems.  \n\nBut saving is almost always possible if you are motivated and flexible.  Let's say your take home pay is $1,800 a month.  (about right for $30k/ $15/hr job).  \n\nAnd, your rent is $1,000 a month.  Our first advice around here would be to try to move someplace cheaper, get roommates, something like that.  Second, we'd recommend not having a car to avoid car insurance/car payments because if you live someplace where $1,000 is the lowest rent, you probably can get by without a car, at least for a while.  So, $100 for transit.  \n\nThen we'd recommend you go on \"beans and rice\" style groceries for a while, so your grocery bill is only $180 a month or so.  No eating out.  No new clothes, cancel all unnecessary subscriptions. We'd say get your cell phone down to $30/mo or less.  Cancel cable, get the cheapest internet, and hopefully, your other utility type bills total under $100/mo (fairly common if you are in fact living in a city apartment.)  If you do these things you might be able to save $100-$200 a month.  Do that for 6 months, and you probably have $1,000 saved.  You might keep going if you can to get it up to $3,600 or more.  But, even if you stop when you have $1,800 saved you are no longer living paycheck to paycheck.  \n\nIf you want to speed it up, it might make sense to get a side hustle or second job that brings in $100-$300 a month.     \n\nIn PF, we tend to believe that the peace of mind and economic security that an emergency fund provides is worth the sacrifices to build one.

On top of that, by building it in the first place, you know what you can do to 'tighten the belt' in the future. So when your car's alternator dies, you can afford to get it fixed right away, but you also know how to re-build your emergency fund after taking the hit for that repair.",

For example all the late fees that you incur as a result is likely their fault. If your mortgage goes to the default rate because of it, then the difference in interest on your entire mortgage may be damages. If it causes a mark on your credit just prior to apply for a mortgage, than the bump in rates may be damages. In these cases many thousands in damages isn't unreasonable. Three days late though shouldn't cause anything more than a late fee, and if you get hit with that make them pay it. The thousands in damages would likely require they are late by 45 days or so.",

Those 12 hours don't include a flat 8 hours of additional medical leave per month. Personal leave goes up too with years of service. After 5 years it's 15 hours a month, and 18 hours a month after 8 years. \n\n\nCompare that to my last job, which was private sector. 7h leave a month that you couldn't start using until you'd been there an entire year, and didn't start accruing until your 3-6 month probationary period was over. After 6 years you went up to 9 hours, and 11 hours after 10 years. No separate medical leave.\n\n\nThings could be better, but I'm pretty excited because I can't imagine how I will use all this off time, especially when you consider the fact that I have 3 entire days off each week, and an 8 day weekend every 18 weeks for shift rotation.",

            "comment": "Hi there,\n\nnot sure if you are in a situation to take advantage of this or not but one of the biggest changes I made in my own personal finance was to get a single, cash back rewards type credit card that gives money back on everything (mine is currently 1% everything 2% groceries, 3% gasoline)   and put all your bills onto that one card.      This does a few things.\n\n1. It gives you a bit more flexibility when it comes to paying bills, instead of worrying how much is in your account throughout the month when X bill is due you just pay off the credit card in full each month after you receive your pay and your bills are paid in full when they need to be. \n\n2. it builds up your credit and builds a good repayment history which will help you later in life if you need it. \n\n3. it has a built in savings account you can use as an emergency fund.\n\nI've used this for a number of years now, earned approx 2,000 USD in cash rewards over the time I've had it and I have not paid a a single cent in interest charges or fees because I pay the balance off in FULL every month.  Last November I lost my job and I had the saved up cash rewards that I could cash in to pay for bills between when I lost my job and when unemployment kicked in which was a huge relief in a time where money was tight.\n\nThe big downside of this plan however is the temptation to overspend / let it slide for a month and get a big ticket item or spend more than you are making.  If you do go this route, make sure you keep tight track of how much you spend / how much you take in each month and make sure you arn't going over because once you get behind the insane credit card interest kicks in and you end up paying back alot more than you gain by using this method. \n\nAnywho I hope this helps and your financial situation improves!

About a two weeks after the second hiring waves, one of the newest guys gets super pissed on payday cause he doesn't have any money in his account. He goes to the boss to find out what's going on. The boss says he'll look into it, so about an hour passes and the boss comes back. Tells the guy that Payroll (one woman department) forgot to add him into the payroll system. That they'll add him in and he'll get all of his back pay in the next week's check. Then the boss says, verbatim, \"I understand the inconvenience of this, and we are all very sorry this happened, here is a $10 gift card to a gas station to help, but I really do need you to get back to work now.\" Obviously the dude that didn't get paid was pissed and after loosing a few choice words at the boss quit on the spot. Then the stands there, sees everyone on the floor staring at him, then says \"Some people are so unreasonable.\" Before walking back into his office. ",

(Do you even have a contract? I'm in Australia, where contracts are the norm.) It might be that the actual *requirement* is that you must be paid before the 15th and the end of the month, for example, and the 7th and the 22nd are just when they *usually* pay you. If that's the case, then they aren't failing in their obligations to you if they pay you later than usual, as long as it's within the actual window (before the 15th in this hypothetical case), and you should avoid making plans that rely on being paid on the 7th.\n\nOf course, there's a difference between what a company is obliged to do and what a *good* company *should* do. It may be worth having a frank discussion with your employers about the fact that you're living paycheck to paycheck, and to see what can be done to insulate you from the effects of payroll delays, or maybe even find out what it would take to earn a raise.",

I was stupid with money in my early 20s and now I'm paying the price. I'm stuck with student loans payments, credit card payments, a mortgage and a car payment in addition to basic utilities and groceries. I spend 0 money that's not necessary. No new clothes, no entertainment, no eating out, no new home furnishings and I still live paycheck to paycheck until I get some of my debts paid off. I would LOVE to have a month or even a week salary in savings but it's just not feasible right now. I'm working to improve it but at the current moment, it's tough! ",

So when you wrote \"it's just not feasible right now\", to my mind, you *are* doing it - right now - if you are currently focused on knocking out that debt. In fact, having that debt will train your lifestyle to be able to put aside that money, and when the debt disappears, it will be far easier to just save it rather than change your lifestyle to spend it.\n\nWhat's your payoff horizon on the cc debt? Are we talking months or years?\n\nAlso, I'm the same way: when it's time to pay off a debt, I kill just about every luxury. No new clothes, no movie nights, no eating out, simply nothing that isn't a utility or food. So I know the pain, and I know it's hard. Good luck!",

I've seen interest rates as high as 50% on some *really* highly recommended loan companies. When I was learning about being in debt I thought about getting a loan to manage it and got offered a loan for $5,000 where, over the period of 3 years, I'd wind up paying $9,000. I noped right the fuck out of that one.",

I pulled out excel sheets and starting planning out how much to pay on each card during that gap from what living savings I can accumulated. Can't just pay everything I had - have to have something to pay the next month, and maybe the next. But don't wanna pay the min, these rates are dangerously high, and the minimum was almost pure interest.\n\nThat experience was brutal, bad memories and math I don't ever want to deal with again.",

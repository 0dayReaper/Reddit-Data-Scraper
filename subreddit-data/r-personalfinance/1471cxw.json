    "postText": "Hi All, \n\nI have recently been given a decent sum of money (\u00a32,500) by a family member as a moving in to a new house present. I have pretty much all I need for the house, so am planning on saving as much as I can. \n\nA bit about me: \n\nI\u2019ve recently left University and have a good job working in the University - Salary 22k ish. I only have 3 bank accounts, a standard daily account, a graduate account and a savings account which I can only deposit \u00a3150 a month in. \n\nMy question is, what should I do with the money as I don\u2019t want to spend it and I can\u2019t deposit it into my savings account in one go. How can I get the best return for my money? \n\nThanks in advance.",

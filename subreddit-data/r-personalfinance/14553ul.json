    "postText": "Reading the question in the title I immediately think \"no, you shouldn't\". So a bit of context:\n\nI currently have a small car (Toyota Aygo from 2015) which I bought used in 2018, my financial situation has improved considerably since then and I've been holding out on changing the car until I could get an electric car.\n\nI've now come across a finance offer that is really tempting to me, it's a 0% APR PCP deal for 2 years where I put down 30% of the car's cost as a deposit and pay monthly payments well within my budget (less than 10% of my monthly income), when the 2 years are up I'll have an optional final payment that is roughly 50% of the value of the car today. I could eventually re-finance that final payment but it would probably not be a 0% APR deal.\n\nThe question is, would it make sense to go for it or would it be too big of a risk?",

Wasting 80% of your worth just having a new car is shortsighted.. do you have an emergency fund? investments? 401k? That is where that money should live. Make your money work for you, this is the kind of move that keeps people in the debt cycle. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThose deals are meant to entice people who can barely afford it. They don't care about your financial well-being. Stay strong :)",

I don't have investments as I've been always too scared of starting and too overwhelmed with information for the different options. I have no debt at the moment.\n\nThe bit that seemed good to me about this offer is that I would pay no interest and with an initial deposit of 30% of the value of the car it would fall well within my range for buying a car, the bit that makes me more doubtful is the final payment. I know I'll probably be able to make it without issues, but what if I don't? Would it make more sense if I put a larger amount as a deposit to lower that final payment for the eventuality that my circumstances might change and I would no longer be able to afford that final payment?",

                            "comment": "&gt;0% APR PCP deal for 2 years where I put down 30%\n\nWhy bet your financial freedom on a car? PCPs are meant to entice people by getting people to think that. wow, low car payment! You literally give them 30% of the value of the car upfront and if you default... car is gone. The car loses the deposit value as soon as you drive it off the lot. \n\nBy the time you get to the balloon payment.. the car could be worth less than the balloon payment. That is going to hurt to then have to finance that piece, not sure who would finance balloon payments on vehicles. The car is not legally yours, you are stuck in the contract, and cancelling early could be penalised. The PCP contracts are riddled with gotchas. \n\nYou are asking if its a big risk... it is. If you have a car just drive it. Trust me, I would love to drive a new tesla to work everyday, but I take the train because its practical and costs me basically nothing and I want to sleep at night lol",

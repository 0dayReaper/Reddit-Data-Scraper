    "postText": "I am considering using 6 month payment plans for some furniture and a computer, probably around $4k total at around 9% APY is my guess (no hard numbers yet). \n\nWhat kind of an effect will it have on my credit score (currently ~740) if I open 2 or 3 new short term debts that will be closed out in about 6 months time? \n\nThanks\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEdit: to provide some more info and context \n\n9% for 6 months on $4k comes out to just shy of $180, which isn\u2019t much and worth it to have the computer and furniture now instead of 6 months from now in my opinion. So if that is the only downside then I\u2019m okay with it, but I wasn\u2019t sure what the effect on my score would be and I don\u2019t want to do anything that will hurt me long term.\n\nFor context on my current situation: I am contributing 6% to my 401k (13% with match) as well as maxing my HSA and I maxed my IRA last 2 years. I rent and with utilities and all other housing expenses it comes out to 38.5% of my take home (after tax and above contributions, but before IRA). Then I also have a car and with insurance, gas, upkeep etc it\u2019s about 15% of take home.\n\nI don\u2019t think savings in the long term will be an issue for me, but because I have recently taken a new job and moved states, as well as a few vacations to see friends and family, this year has been spending heavy and as such I don\u2019t have cash outside of my investments.\n\nI have like 60% of my furniture now, but still need a sofa and a couple other small things, and was hoping to get a computer (admittedly an expensive one that\u2019s for gaming lol). The computer I can definitely wait on without much issue which would bring the loan down to like $2k total, but I haven\u2019t had a sofa or proper seating for like 6 months now and I\u2019m just moving my desk chair around the house when I want to use my laptop or eat or watch tv haha. It works but obviously not ideal and makes it hard to invite people over.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nEdit 2: I am reconsidering based on comments below, also some more context:\n\nI am 25yo with a pretty good job at the first year of my career (last few years was contract work and I wouldn\u2019t consider it \u2018career\u2019 building), I make $75k now and expecting a raise in the next month or so (approved by manager (and his manager too I think) but pending HR, not a sure thing by a long shot so I\u2019m not factoring that into any decisions just mentioning it). \n\nComputer purchase is 100% personal and for entertainment (gaming) only, I have a work provided laptop at the office for my job as well as a MacBook at home for general daily use.",

If you have an emergency during this time you'll likely need to take on higher interest debt, which will be even harder to pay off and could be financially ruinous or at least extremely painful for a long time.",

Don't wait for the raise.  I would cut back 401k contributions to just get the full match, and pause on the IRA as well.  The emergency fund should come first as it's what gives you the buffer to maximize investment contributions.  It sounds like you're in a great place when it comes to income and expenses, just reprioritize a bit for the short term and you'll be fine.",

You are trying to control expenses not run a full accounting system on your finances which is unnecessary and counter productive. You can see how quickly things become more complicated than they need to be.\n\nI use a receipt tracking app, if I spend money I log it there. Whether it is cash, or card, or click, it is irrelevant to me. At the end of the month I know where my money went which is what matters. At the end of the month I flush excess cash out into my savings account.",

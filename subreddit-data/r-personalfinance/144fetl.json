    "postText": "Title basically says it, around a year and a half ago, younger and more naive me fell for the \"financial advisor\" thing they love to do, basically im paying way too much a month for whole life and my coverage isnt even that great, i was sold on the promise of accumulated cash value by the time im 50 or whatever, but knowing what i know now id rather put that money towards my roth, im 24 with no major health issues and i work for the family business so i do have somewhat of a safety net there. I just feel like i got screwed and im throwing nearly 450 a MONTH away to this policy, like i said i was young and dumb and making scale wages at the time i agreed to the monthly premiums. What is the best way to get out of this? Just cancel it outright? If i were to cancel now id be out like 7k just on paid premiums up to now, is it worth it to just rip the bandaid off and cancel it? I tried calling and they kinda gave me the run around.",

Im sure its worth it for someone who needs it, but I just flat out dont need it and started investing in this because i was under the impression it was a good long term investing tool.",

For anyone else reading this: Don't listen to that advice. \n\nThe idea of term is that you get the term policy when you have actual dependents, and invest the difference between those premiums and what you would have paid for Whole Life. Those investments would grow over the years, and you're ALSO not paying for ridiculous commissions, as you would with the Whole Life policy. So you have the term to protect your dependents if you croak earlier than expected. But, if you save and invest throughout your life, you should eventually be at a point where you don't NEED life insurance to ensure that your dependents are taken care of. \n\nWhole Life is useful for those very few people who have over ~$13 million in assets, who need a way to avoid the Estate tax. \n\nHere's a good article explaining why Whole Life is not good for the majority of people: \n\nhttps://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/debunking-the-myths-of-whole-life-insurance/\n\nIn short: Stop telling people nonsense.",

    "postText": "Hey there so this is my first time posting and needing some advice on what to do with 135K after selling our first home.\r\n\n1. Me 27 &amp; wife 30\r\n2. Salary for me is 150K and hers is 80k\r\n3. Debt - I have 35000 left in private student loans (637 month at 2.7% )and she has 60k in federal student loans. One car with about 35000$ (500 monthly at 3.2%)\r\n4. I max out 401k, max out HSA, 200 monthly to a retirement healthcare plan my company offers, and the 250 a check gets deposited into my pension play from the company as well. So total around 90K for all these vehicles. She only puts in 2% to 401K (that is all the company will match), and 100 monthly to her HSA.\r\n5. Emergency Fund - 20k (10k in bonds, and the other 10 in savings account), wife has 30k sitting in a savings account and doesn't won't to invest it, wife Roth IRA has 9k, my personal savings of 10k sitting in a savings account. Trip account with 10k.\r\n6. She works in non-profit so does the PSLF Program forgives so that is why she pays the minimum and has about 4 years left of working in non-profit and they told her at the end she would owe 10% of whatever the remaining balance is. (But I don't know how accurate this is)\n\nWhere not looking to buy another house for about 3 to 4 years but don't really know what to prioritize or go next from here. Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

Both would outpace the interest on all of your debts for now.  If you want to free up income stream, you could pay off your loans and the car and save for a future down payment at your own pace.  Doesn't sound like you're hurting for money though.  There is no 10% repayment or penalty for PSLF.  The remaining balance on all qualifying direct loans are forgiven.",

Even CDs with terms longer than a year will be taxed the same as their income. They'd take a big haircut in their income bracket on gains. If they're gonna hold it for more than a year they should target investments eligible for long term capital gains treatment or other tax advantaged investments.",

You could put the amount that you plan to use for your next down payment on a home in a savings account you don't touch.  If you're looking for use to tell you to shove it in the stock market, as we are in a recession where liquidity is being drawn out of the system at a high rate, and interest rates are high, that's not the answer I'm going to give you.  Why did you sell the home?  Do you have to move or relocate for the next home/job etc?",

            "comment": "Tough spot with the timeline. How much of a house are you thinking about buying? What are your future expenses? Are you ok carrying debt? What are your financial goals near and long term?\n\nI only see 2 options.\n\nOption 1 - Invest in stock market.\n\nI would be hesitant on the stock market for that time frame,I made money on a home sale and invested Nov 2021 at the height of the market. I am still down $20k, but at one point I was down $60k. I haven\u2019t needed it, but it would be a major stress relief to have just put it into shorter less risky investments as I had a 3 year plan when I put it in. You also lose some flexibility with your money. Depending on your investment ideas, you could lose big money on individual stocks. I would go index/equities if you choose this route and diversify.\n\nOption 2 - Pay off debt/put rest in HYSA, CDs, bonds, etc. This is an either or option. \n\nAs others have said short term investments get taxed at your current rate. But at least you know you have a guaranteed return and your money is flexible. (When your tired of current situation and the dream house pops up). \n\nPaying the debt off saves money and is liberating mentally. It also helps your debt to income ratio, that $1100 in payments would equate to another $150,000 in house mortgage. \n\nThe flip side is, current mortgage rates are 7% and it would be smart to put as big of a down payment on the high interest rate. So saving to pay down future debt and making minimum payments on current low interest debt is mathematically ideal.\n \nLastly, talk to your wife about maxing her 401k and HSA. It will help lower your AGI and help boost retirement. Not really sure why she is only putting in 2%, with both of your salaries and debts, she should be putting in at least 15%.\n\nEither way your in a good spot financially, and could always mix and match options. Maybe all you want is a $400k house, could put $80k in HYSA, and $55k in a brokerage.",

            "comment": "Since you have a great financial setup as far as retirement contributions, savings for emergency, (I'm sure a rainy day fund also) and all liabilities are comfortably being paid, I would then suggest throw the $135k into a 3-5yr fixed annuity. \n\nCD rates are decent now, but if you have ZERO plans for the next few years where you see yourself needing it, pick an annuity option. 5-6.5% currently on APY\n\nEither way, visit your bank or brokerage agent (if you have a brick and mortar firm) and speak with a CFP\n\nOr, a fidelity blue chip ETF, but that's longer term so ehhhh. Or if you wanna get risky, throw it on NVIDIA. With AI booming and more to come in the tech industry in the years to come, NVIDIA is only going up.\n\nNot financial advice.",

It is very specific. It does not have a tax burden if it's actually PSLF. Additionally, your tax strategy together would likely be more complex than this but she can lower her monthly loan payment by increasing her 401k contributions to lower her AGI, if she is on a proper income based plan.",

I was doing my own clean up and realized that in my 401k I had a 'balanced' S&amp;P 500 whatever that means and the performance was complete trash compared to just regular ole' S&amp;P 500. I moved the funds over and it's fixed but I've probably lost $15k or more in value based on thinking I had a S&amp;P 500 fund but I actually had a managed/balanced fund that was hot garbage. Don't make my mistake - check your funds and make sure it's what you are wanting, and check the expense ratios!",

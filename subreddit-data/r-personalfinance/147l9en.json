Is this statistic more consistent with a 20% down approach, or is it reasonable even with a just 3% FHA down payment? \nI ask this because I am seeing a lot of \"flips\" in my area which I don't necessarily think is a bad thing  because the housing stock here in general is old. But because flippers obviously raise the price of the house for profit, do appraisals increase accordingly? Or is there some understood gap where if someone wants to buy a flipped house they will have to have a higher down payment?",

I have been offered a position at a private school with a slighter higher salary (by about $5k). They offer a 401k with John Hancock. I am still a little confused about the employer's contributions but I believe she said 3 or 4 percent and then beyond that they contribute 50% up to a certain amount. I talked to my advisor through my 403b and he said I'd need to make an extra 20k for it to be worth it for me to leave public ed (in order to end up with same salary after retirement). I'm so confused and have to make a decision very soon. Any thoughts? Please help!",

I highly doubt your advisor through 403b is an unbiased source but they could be correct here.\n\nHighly recommend speaking with someone who knows your TRS plan very well but is completely unbiased (teacher friend also interested in finance? Or teacher friend spouse who is in finance?) OR alternatively, get the TRS plan documents and reach out to a CFP (certified financial planner) and pay them an hourly (likely $200ish for 1-3 hours - I get that is expensive but this is a big decision).\n\nAlternatively, I have heard that many teachers strongly prefer private schools so if you are financially stable and want to make the change, it may make sense to take the job even if it results in less money at retirement.\n\nEdit: my credentials are that I have been in consulting/finance/MBA world for about a decade, am a business owner now, and I have considered/applied for high school business teaching jobs in the last 12 months. The way teacher's retirement works in my state depends a lot on years of service so there's also a big question as to how long you want to work. It's very possible that if you worked for 40 years there would be a $20k difference, but at a more \"normal\" 30 year retirement they would be roughly equal.",

                    "comment": "&gt;Is it possible for me to do a Backdoor Roth with my existing Trad IRA?\n\nYes, you can still do the backdoor with an existing Traditional IRA, even when it has a balance of deducted dollars and growth.  But any exiting pre-tax balance in your traditional will cause part of your Roth conversion step to contain taxable dollars. So the backdoor is not as \"clean\"(owing nothing for tax) as when you have a $0 Trad IRA balance, but it is still allowed.\n\nYou could even potentially do the backdoor for 2023, putting $6500 into a Traditional IRA and converting the entire $15,000 in one go.  There's no limit on amount you are allowed to convert, only on new contributions.  The $8500 you already have in that would be treated as taxable income for this year (which may or may not be worth the benefit), but then for 2024 and beyond you'd have a $0 pre-tax balance and can do a clean backdoor.\n\n&gt;If no to #1, is it possible for me to open a new Trad IRA for the purposes of a Backdoor Roth?\n\nNo.  The IRS looks at your pre-tax balance across **all** Traditional IRAs in your name, not just the particular one you use for the backdoor.\n\n&gt;If no to #2, what are the best options I have? Is it simply to continue contributing to the Trad IRA? Are there other types of accounts I should look into?\n\nIf your income prevents you from making direct Roth IRA contributions, you're in a high enough tax bracket that focusing on deductible contributions probably makes more sense.\n\nAre you currently enrolled in a work retirement plan like a 401k?  If so, use pre-tax contributions into that for your retirement savings.  Once you're maxing that out ($22,500 for 2023), then it might be worth considering any Roth options.  \n\nSome 401k plans allow for \"reverse rollovers\" from a Traditional IRA.  This would let you move this Traditional IRA balance into the 401k, where it then does not factor into the backdoor.  If you could do that before December 31st 2023, then you'd be freed up for doing the backdoor this year with no (or at least minimal) tax cost.\n\nIf you are not enrolled in a work plan during any point of 2023, then you can make deductible contributions into a Traditional IRA.  The income limits around deductions only apply when you also have a work plan.  You're stuck with the IRA's lower annual contribution limit vs. a 401k, but it's still something and typically better than an account without an IRA's tax advantages.\n\n&gt;Would hiring a financial planner make sense for me, even though it would likely cost thousands for an account with only $8,500? Acknowledging that they would be able to help in other areas, but I'm fairly satisfied with my financial picture right now.\n\nA financial planner may be overkill for just this one thing.  There are advisors that will do one-time consultations for a more reasonable fee than \"thousands\".  TBH, I'm not sure what a typical rate would be, though.",

We've got maybe 20k ready cash on hand, but we could also cash out assets.  \n\nThe idea of only having to pay taxes is super appealing, and high interest rates make a mortgage even less so, but I'm unsure about tapping so deeply into what we've decided will be our main retirement fund, and it would probably be a hard sell to the wife as well.  I've seen advice that recommends buying up front if you can, and I've seen the exact opposite, and just about everything in between!",

I can share what we did based on a lot of help navigating this.\n\nSo we looked into loans, even with a good credit score the rates were around 6 or so percent. We are very lucky and we ended up borrowing from my boyfriend's dad at 3.75% interest with a little over a 10% down payment. 10% is typical, but putting as much as 20% can save you bigger bucks.\n\nFor investments, it truly depends on who you ask. We are taking about 30k from an investment account and have another 20k cash for our down payment. We have other investments so we were coached into taking some out.\n\nBut even with a private loan or \"cash\" the market is CUT THROAT, specially right now in the summer. We thought apartments  were bad but this takes it to a new level. Houses last three-four days and bidding wars are common. We just put a competitive offer on a house that we adored, 20k over asking and it still was not enough. Mind you, this house was a total of 3 days on the market. Apparently, there are two other \"cash\" buyers and we had to come close to our max budget, and even then I have no idea if were going to win this bidding war. You also have to account home insurance, taxes (which I see you already did) and closing costs and of course having money left over for repairs.\n\nI will say if you can wait just a tiny bit I would. Summer is about the worst time to buy. We have an end date on this lease, so if we must we will move back in with one of our parents and save even more money to perhaps be more competitive.\n\nI do not mean to discourage you but this market is very tough, good luck!",

It sounds scary, but the program helped me land a job where I'll make \\~$230k all-in/yr (think big law, banking, etc.).\n\nAdditionally, I have $90k in a brokerage account that is mostly in index funds like VOO and VTX. \n\nMy questions really stem from how to approach the loans. My mindset going forward is to live below my means for the next few years and pay off these loans as quick as possible. I'm debating if I should liquidate the brokerage account to jumpstart the pay-off process. \n\nPart of me thinks I shouldn't because this is a great potential house down payment in a few years. Additionally, if I liquidate that's a relatively big tax bill for long-term capital gain. Granted I'll have to pay this at some point once I liquidate, but I'd rather do this when my finances are more stable. Lastly, the market gains could outpace the loan IR. This is more of a coin-flip but it's something to consider. \n\nOn the other hand, knocking out a big portion of these loans would speed up my goal of being debt free. And there is the emotional component.\n\nThere might be something to be said about lifestyle inflation here too. If I have to pay a big portion of student loans every month, my free cashflow would be more limited which might help me spend less.\n\nAny advice or thoughts to consider are appreciated.",

This is a big bill and while you have the salary to handle it throwing all your money may not necessarily be the best plan of action. I mean you can get 4% interest in an ally's saving account so it really depends on your apr what you should do.",

They're less expensive (and that's not even touching the ethical and environmental issues around fast fashion).\n\nLook, it's your money and you can do with it what you want, but if your priority is to save up for a house, or save up for retirement, then spending money every month on those things seems...indulgent. How much do you want to buy a house? How much do you want to be set for retirement? Are those desires stronger than the urge to eat out or buy clothes/shoes? What kind of life do you want for yourself in 5 years, 10 years, 20? How does your spending now fit into achieving that?

My question is should I wait and save up until I have the full payoff amount, which is about $19,000, to make the payment all at once, or should I pay the $2-3k extra per month towards the car.  \n\nMy apr is rough at about 12% and I\u2019m 5-6 months into a 60 month car loan payment.  So, I want to get this paid off asap without needing to take a credit hit and get it refinanced currently.  So, if I pay an extra $2k per month, does that go entirely to the principal amount and lower my overall accruing interest or is that being eaten up in interest for future payments too?  Alternatively, would it be smart to refinance it and get a rate closer to like 7% potentially and save a little interest in the 7-10 months it will take to pay it off?  Or is that realistically only saving like $500 total and not worth the credit hit and inquiry?\n\nTLDR: Should I wait to pay off my car loan until I save up enough to pay it off entirely?  Or should I pay $2-3k extra monthly to lower the total balance until I can pay it off in the coming months?",

Is this job your only household income?  If you and your spouse work, then this could be right for your joint situation, but would require more information to be sure.\n\nAssuming only one job, for MFJ on a $70k annual income (taking your $2692 per check and assumed 26 bi-weekly pay periods), your annual total tax owed would be about $4600; so divided back into 26 paychecks would be roughly $177.  If your annual salary will be closer to $75k (maybe with a bonus that isn't reflected here?), that'd go up a bit, but only to about $200.\n\nIf your W-4 was set up with \"claiming 0\" (which hasn't been an option for at least a few years), that'd **increase** the amount of withholding compared to the \"expected\" selection of 3 allowances (1 for you + 1 for MFJ + 1 for single job).  That might explain the extra $250-ish being withheld, but would simply come back to you after filing your return as a $6500 or so refund.\n\nIf you submit a new W-4 to your job with just status of \"married filing jointly\" and nothing else, I'd expect your federal tax withholding to drop to $175-200 per check.  But if your spouse works, you'd have to do some more work to make sure that your joint withholding (across all jobs) is appropriate for your ultimate joint tax bill.",

So your job's current paycheck withholding would cover all of that by itself, making any withholding at her job unnecessary and entirely refunded.\n\nAFAIK, doing a W-4 with \"Married filing jointly + 2 jobs\" effectively calculates withholding the same as being single (maybe with some minor difference).  Under that, I'd expect your paychecks to have about $340 withheld + hers with $135, resulting in a total year's tax payments of $12500 and a final refund in the ballpark of $2500.  Maybe not an \"optimal\" setup, but somewhat close while giving you some buffer for any tax weirdness that might crop up.\n\nIf you'd rather not wait until next year's tax refund to get this extra back, you could walk through the IRS's [withholding calculator](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator), give that all your income (both jobs) / deduction / credit details, and it'll spit out a couple of W-4s to submit to the two employers.  It'd try to \"balance out\" the extra withholding done so far in 2023, so those numbers would not be appropriate to keep for all of 2024.  You'd want to re-run that calculator next January to get a better setup for an entire year.",

A coupon can reduce what you owe for an item (but not below zero - the store isn\u2019t going to pay you for buying something from them). And if you pay with a bigger bill, you might get more change (a refund). But at the end of the day, as long as you have to pay the store with some kind of bill, the coupon helps you.\n\nA refundable credit (which exists by the way - a common one is a portion of the child tax credit) you get even if you have no tax that year. It lets you have a \u201cnegative\u201d tax rate (the IRS pays you money even if you have no withholding). Those are obviously rarer.",

If a couple filing jointly made $100K in gross income (after 401k etc), they would have a federal tax liability of around $7500.  That could be reduced by child tax credits, then you would apply the child and dependent care credit.  The only way you wouldn't get benefit was if you had a lot less income, or a lot more children than the one you described here.",

                    "comment": "The calculation of taxable income is correct. But to be pedantic about the terms and the order of operations\u2014\n\nThe definition of \"gross income\" in the tax code is actually net of your 401k contributions. That's a weird definition of \"gross\", but that's what the tax code uses. It's called \"total income\" on the tax return itself but gross income in the law.\n\nThe HSA contribution, if made through your payroll, is also excluded from gross income. If you make the contribution directly from your bank account however, it's considered an adjustment, which is subtracted to get to Adjusted Gross Income. From there, the standard deduction is subtracted from AGI to get taxable income. So your tax return would either look like:\n\n* Total Income = 73,650\n* AGI = 73,650\n* Standard Deduction = 13,850\n* Taxable Income = 59,800\n\nOr,\n\n* Total Income = 77,500\n* HSA Deduction = 3,850\n* AGI = 73,650\n* Standard Deduction = 13,850\n* Taxable Income = 59,800\n\n&gt; Is this correct? Additionally, if I contributed $6,500 to a traditional IRA on top of my company-provided traditional 401K I will not be able to claim that $6,500 as a deductible correct?\n\nYour (Modified) AGI would be $73,650, [which is in the range that a portion of your contribution would be deductible and a portion wouldn't.](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/2023-ira-deduction-limits-effect-of-modified-agi-on-deduction-if-you-are-covered-by-a-retirement-plan-at-work) Specifically, 6.5% would be nondeductible and the other 93.5% would be, since your AGI is 6.5% of the way between the two cutoff points. \n\nSo you could deduct $6,078 if you made a $6,500 contribution. It would be considered an adjustment, so it would not reduce your total income but would reduce your AGI.",

Saving for retirement is mostly about securing a safe financial future. So if it's a close choice between Roth and Trad, with Trad being better at lower income projections, and Roth being better at the higher income end, you should tend to prefer Trad. \"I accidentally owe more taxes in retirement because I have way more money that I thought I would\" is a problem everyone should hope to have.\n2. You can hedge your bets. But 20% of your money into a Roth and 80% into Trad, if that would make you feel better. It's more important *how much* you're contributing. The exact account type is less important.",

I feel like giving myself 30% of my monthly paycheck is more than enough money to buy the things that I want. If you don\u2019t feel like 30% is enough for you or you can\u2019t afford that, then find ways to increase your income. I picked up a part time tutoring job and it always helped me to remember I was doing it for more fun money and not because I had to in order to pay the bills. \n\nAlso you could be struggling to stick to a budget because it is too strict. I started my budget by finding the average amount of money I historically spent in that category. Over time I adjust the budget to fit what I feel is a more appropriate amount.

About a week after I opened my account I noticed I could no longer access it on the app. I called numerous times and was told the research team was looking into it, but that no further information on my account could be provided. I\u2019m thinking maybe someone tried to hack into my account or something, but it\u2019s been increasingly frustrating not having access to my account for over a month, mainly just to confirm that my money is still there. \n\nWell, after a month, the research team finally called me and told me they\u2019ve determined that the funds are fraudulent (wtf?!)! They will not allow any access to my funds and have told me I\u2019ve committed fraud. This is literally just a large chunk of my personal savings (close to $100k in this account). There is nothing fraudulent about it, and I have no idea how they reached that conclusion. Do I call the previous company I had these funds in that they transferred from (another large, big name financial company)? Do I get a lawyer? How can they just legally take all of my money like this?",

I'm gonna assume you don't have kids. Traveling does get old, but it's 6 months for money that could help you buy a house or clear student debt.\n\nTell them to get TSA PreCheck and maybe Clear.

But if Merrill edge doesn't have the same funds what happens? In the case of the 401k I think it should be fine either way since even if they exit my position and I rebuy something similar since it would be rollover into an IRA there shouldn't be any tax consequenes, but for the brokerage if they don't have it would i incur capital gains at that point?",

For 401Ks, some firms will send you a physical check, so make sure your address is up-to-date and the payee is proper (pay to Merrill for the benefit of pursuingmaterialism).  You might want to reach out to Fidelity/NetBenefits.\n\nFor your taxable brokerage accounts, you'll be doing a transfer of assets (TOA).  Before you initiate anything on these taxable accounts, you might want to reach out to Merrill and confirm that you can do a TOA in-kind, resulting in no/minimal tax impact.  Merrill should be able to do this and let you know in advance if any need to be sold and transferred in cash, which would have a tax impact.  If you hold any fractional shares, they may need to be sold.  And you should ask them about the process, so you're aware of the timing, do they transfer in one lump sum or in piecemeal, etc.  And if you have any transfer lockdowns enabled, you'll need to remove them before you initiate the transfer.",

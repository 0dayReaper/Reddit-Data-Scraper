    "postText": "I work fulltime and attend grad school part time, but still qualify for loans. I don\u2019t take nearly the full amount but do use some of it for living expenses. I recently started making 46k instead of 36k so I can hopefully rely on it a little less.\n\n\nI have 3 credit cards with about 5-6k debt in total. I have 3-4 more years of classes left and was hoping to pay off most of my CC debt before I have to start paying off the loans.\n\nI am considering taking out a little extra to cover living expenses I\u2019d normally cover with my own income and then using my income to pay off one of the cards. I realize I\u2019ll end up just paying it back later but I think it will help me start chipping away at the other CC payments. I know technically loans are for classes and living expenses, but my logic is I can use the loan money for my rent and food (normally paid for by income).\n\nAnyone have any guidance, comments, advice?",

Meaning just pay the minimum each month and pay it all off before the end of the terms and you should be good. \n\nMy payment structure is 10% each month for 12 month terms and of 8% each month for 18 months. Gives you extra room if you won\u2019t be able to make the full payments. Reminder that the student loans and the fee from the balance transfers might be different amounts. In short it might be easier to do the student loans IF THE INTEREST RATE IS CLOSE TO 3%",

You didn't list your interest rates, but it's likely that your credit card interest rates are *much, much* larger than the student loan interest rates.\n\nYou're not talking about taking out a lot of unnecessary debt, just enough to pay off those cards. I think your plan makes sense.",

With credit cards, if worse comes to worst you could quit paying them and tank your credit or declare bankruptcy. You can't easily get rid of student loans.\n\nYou have to think about which type of risk you'd rather take.",

There are YouTube videos that have extensive information on these two methods. Prep your own meals and refrain from going out to eat. Pause all investments including IRAs. Just invest enough of your salary to receive your company's matching contribution for your 401 K. Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors.",

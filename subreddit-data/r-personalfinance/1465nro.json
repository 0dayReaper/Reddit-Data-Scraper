I'm not here for a lecture on the benefits of using credit cards and loans properly etc. I've rented my current place for a while and had to have someone else vouch for me (not cosign) to get it. However now I have rental history so it should be no problem going forward right? Wrong. From what I've read many places will automatically deny applications from people without good credit. This is before you even get to communicate that you have plenty of money for the lease.\n\nHow would you go about this? Email or call to discuss it before applying or just hope you pass the initial processes for applying? I know some places are willing to work with you if you can pay more up front and some may just want to make sure you can actually afford the lease and not require any extra payment.",

This leaves you vulnerable if you have a crap landlord/apartment management company who doesn't fix things in a prompt timeframe.\n\nYou could use the previous landlords as references. Also, if you ever reported your previous rent payments to the credit bureaus and paid them on time, that would be another way to build a track record for your credit.\n\nSince you don't have much credit, you may have to get a cosigner.",

Im turning 30 in 2 weeks and I only started caring about credit 1-2 years ago and one of my regrets is not caring in my earlier years and building a thicker healthy credit profile.  You can start very simple by opening a basic credit card with no annual fees and literally just use it for gas and pay it off IN FULL right away or at least before the statement due date. I saw you said in another comment you plan to never own a home and just rent your entire life. Things change and you dont want to be 45 with 0 credit.\n\nI understand you said you didn't want to be lectured and I'm not trying to, just give me 2 cents.\n\nYou did post this on a personal finance subreddit afterall.",

Maybe shop Craigslist, etc. to find places being advertised as cheaply and informally as possible. \n\nYou will most likely need to be able to show some proof of income, tax returns, etc.\n\nThe problem with just paying the lease up front on the landlords end is basically the possibility that you damage their property. Let\u2019s say you live there for six months and have built a slip and slide in their living room and damaged the property with water and neglected to tell them, now all the floors are rotted and need to be replaced.\n\nThey could charge a renter for this, sue, etc. but if the prospective renter is someone who doesn\u2019t care about their credit, and has no income or savings, how would they ever expect to get their money.\n\nThis is why you will probably eventually need to build a credit score. Nobody will want to trust you with their property if you appear to go out of your way to be collection proof.",

    "postText": "Hello, I have messed up a whole lot because of a variety of situationsover the past year and can't afford my credit card and RV payments atthe moment. I live in the RV and cannot lose it and am already late onone RV payment. Now that I am back at work full time, once I startgetting paychecks from full 40 hour weeks I will most likely be alrightbut currently I am extremely not alright. I have to choose betweengetting late fees for multiple credit cards and buying groceries withcash, or putting my groceries on credit. I have already put groceries oncredit repeatedly and it is becoming a vicious cycle no matter how hardI try to get out of it because my debt keeps on going up. I just needto know what to do this month so I can make my RV payment. I havealready called a debt counseling firm and they were not able to helpmuch because I already have reduced payment plans or low interest onmost of my debts. I just don't know what to do.\n\nEdit: It's really cool that people downvoted this when I was clearly in distress. Wtf. In any case I was definitely freaking out last night because I don't really have a good sense of the future/time passing etc and after I calmed down and thought about it I realized a few late fees will suck but if I keep going to work full time and get a side gig like I was thinking about I can definitely get out of this debt and the current money shortage is extremely temporary. Thanks to those who replied, your advice was helpful and I appreciate it.",

Unfortunately I will probably have to incur late fees no matter what because I really can't do both the RV payment and the other debts at the same time. Ce la vie, I guess.",

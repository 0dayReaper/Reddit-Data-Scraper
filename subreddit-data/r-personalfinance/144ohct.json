My take home should be about 2k a week. On average I\u2019ll spend 500 a week for housing and my bills come out to be 1100 a month for other stuff so my take home a month after everything should be roughly 5k a month. I was wondering what you guys would do with that I\u2019m 28 years old and I wanna know what you guys would invest in and what you would spend the money on to have a better future/ retirement thank you!",

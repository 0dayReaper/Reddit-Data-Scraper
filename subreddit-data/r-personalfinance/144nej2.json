    "postText": "Hi all. I realize I'm in a very fortunate financial situation, however I'm having a lot of trouble validating my school costs. Since I was 17 I wanted to be an environmental engineer but I was talked out of it. Last year, at 27, I went back to school for a master's in environmental engineering. It's a great program with good professors and peers. I am on a break from my government job which pays very well. Getting this degree may allow me to move to a position laterally which may be more gratifying for me, however my office recently is allowing remote work for my position which is unheard of so I may stay despite not liking it. Remote work has always been a priority for me.\n\nThis all brings me back to cost. I think I lost my scholarships for this last semester, which means it will cost 28k, bringing my total tuition costs for this degree to 46k. That is about half of my savings. I keep having doubts, I could drop out with an environmental management and science degree now, or I could complete the program with an engineering degree. I don't know how to quantify the cost of this degree when I am ending in the same position I'm starting in. I spent 24k on undergrad and luckily don't have any debt because I worked a lot during my studies. 46k is a brand new car or a down payment on a house or a global vacation. Not to mention the lost wages of the 1.5 years I'll have been studying, this seems like a +100k endeavor and I'm having doubts. I've so far justified it in knowing I needed a break from my job that was awful and realizing a dream I've had for so long, but maybe dreams change? I just don't know mine yet. In an ideal world, they would offer my scholarships again and I'd only pay 9k for the semester. \n\ntl;dr: Graduate school costs are a lot more than I expected. Can I justify the degree cost?",

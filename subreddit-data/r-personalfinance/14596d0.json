    "postText": "I had roughly $14k in CC debt last October. This was entirely from wedding planning, bachelor trip and paying for our honeymoon. Lost my job back at the beginning of the year, but I had budgeted to make double the minimum payments as part of my 6 months emergency savings. Qualified for unemployment which I split directly into CC payments and additional savings. Down to $5k and it feels great. I mapped out finishing that $5k by early December this year while also growing my savings. So I have a plan.\n\nMy biggest ask, is trying to change my approach or mindset when using CCs. I am personally financially pretty frugal, and other than the occasional lunch I dont use my CCs often. But I think I'm missing out on earning points and benefits  by not buying a lot of stuff. Also should I continue to open CC's every year even if they are not being used? From what I gather, this would lower my gross utilization, improve my credit worthiness, and up my potential buying power (even though I'm not buying anything)",

Only use your card for what you need. Don't try to keep up with the Joneses. Be sure to payoff your balance every month.",

What I really want to know; is there any merit to keeping these accounts open even if the balance is zero? Should I continue to increase my total credit worthiness by opening more accounts in the coming years?",

Put all your expenses on the card. Pay the card in full every month. You get plenty of cash back and don\u2019t have any interest charges.",

We've paid off our $385K home, drive well-maintained vehicles (2010 Malibu and 2014 Ridgeline) that have both been long paid off, and we each have one credit card with $20K limits and no balance. Our credit scores are 810 and 840. Our retirement is just north of $500K and growing quickly. Our debt is $0. We're far from \"wealthy,\" but we're comfortable. Incidentally, we spent less than $5K on our wedding and honeymoon. \n\nHow did we get where we are? Aside from not having children (a personal choice, rather than a financial one...though it certainly helped), we stuck to two basic rules: 1) If we couldn't pay cash for it, we didn't buy it and 2) if we could pay cash for it, but doing so would mean dipping into our emergency fund, not being able to make our full retirement contributions, or not being able to to pay our bills, we didn't buy it. These rules still apply to everything. The only things we financed were our home and our vehicles (all of which were pre-owned).",

Have a card with rewards that align with your goal. 2% cash back is a good standard, if you're not a traveler. \n2. Buy **only** the things you would normally buy with cash\n3. Use the card to pay your utilities/bills (assuming no additional fees for doing so).\n4. Pay it off in its entirety every month.  Remember how in #2 you only bought things you could buy with cash?  Now is when you use that cash you saved to pay it off. In full.\n5. Any 'big purchases'?  Save up the cash first so that you can comply with #4.\n\n2% rewards will be wiped out completely when you get with with 20%+ interest charges on carrying a balance.\n\nNo reason to continue to open CCs willy-nilly, but you can certainly keep the ones you have open and lock the cards away in your file cabinet.",

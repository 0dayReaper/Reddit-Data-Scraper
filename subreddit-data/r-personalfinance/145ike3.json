    "postText": "Long story short, I racked up 15k of credit card debt from March 2022 until now. Got married and did a lot of stupid shit. I\u2019ve put the card away and will never use it again.\n\nAnyway, I had a 0% apr card, and always told myself I was going to balance transfer it and give myself more time to pay it off. I make 100k a year so I falsely assumed I was going to be able to pay it easily.\n\nI checked my credit score today and it\u2019s around 650. It\u2019s now hitting me that I may not be approved for a balance transfer card with that score. My credit utilization is 50%.\n\nI have 1500 in savings, so I can\u2019t pay the whole balance. I do have 5400 in my 401k, and 3000 in my Fidelity account (all in VOO).\n\nI was looking at personal loans for that have 12% apr as an option, but idk. I don\u2019t know if want more debt but I don\u2019t know if I have a choice.\n\nAny insight or criticism would be appreciated! I know i have screwed up but j know i can fix it. I can dedicate $2000 a month to debt payments so i know i can get out, i just don\u2019t know the best option.",

The 28% interest is calculated **yearly**. So if you pay the entire $15k off in 9 months, you will just pay **$16,680 total**.",

Same page link to Pricing and Terms After the intro period, a variable APR of 19.99%\u201328.74%. \n\nI think you're good:\n\n&gt;On first glance, a financing offer of \"no interest for 12 months\" and a credit card that advertises \"0% APR for 12 months\" seem to be giving you the same thing \u2014 a way to pay for something over time without worrying about finance charges. But there's a subtle difference that could end up costing you hundreds or even thousands of dollars.\n\n&gt;That difference lies in the distinction between deferred interest and 0% interest.\n\n&gt;By contrast, when a financing offer is presented as \"0% APR,\" it means that during the promotional period, the interest rate that applies is literally 0%. There isn't any interest silently adding up in the background, because 0% of your balance is always $0.\n\n&gt;If you've paid off your balance by the end of the promo period, you will have paid no interest \u2014 just like with a deferred interest offer. But if you have anything left over when the period ends, you will be charged interest only on the remaining balance and only going forward.",

            "comment": "You could look at other balance transfer cards and if you qualify could roll the balance over to another 0% intro rate depending on whats out there. With your credit score and history of doing this you might not qualify for a card that waives the balance transfer fee, but a 2-5% transfer fee would be worth it if you could get another 12-18 months at 0%\n\nYea this strategy just kicks the can further down the road and if your habits don't change this could make it worse. So if you don't have confidence in yourself to do better than don't. \n\nA personal loan could work but it's going to make you laxed most likely and some charge retroactive interest on the entire balance or will even send it to collections if you miss a single payment. They'll advertise No late fees but then do this instead so be very careful. Huge risk there and you would have to read the fine print. \n\nWith being able to put $2,000 in at 28% interest, you're looking at about $349 going towards your interest after next month. Even with that that means 1600 roughly going to credit card and if you're not putting anything more on it, that's around 9 months till paid off if you can truly sink two grand a month into it. \n\nThat 28% interest would turn up the pressure on the flip side and you may need that if you question your ability to change habits. It would be the most costly solution but might be the least risky depending on your demeanor. You would beat yourself up every month paying that interest which would encourage you to accomplish your goal\n\nI wouldn't touch your 401k or savings even with that little in it. Use that fidelity account as an emergency savings too and keep it, because 1500 is nothing for savings, but 4500 combining those would at least allow you to float yourself somewhat if something else happened. You have to always anticipate the unexpected and I wouldn't dry up your savings,  with no ability to self-rescue from another financial crisis.",

What it takes is learning from this and improving your habits, no matter what short-term strategy you need to dig yourself out of the hole. It's more important to learn how to stop digging and it sounds like you're there and ready. \n\nRemember you could always meet in the middle too and it doesn't have to be all or nothing. If you did do another balance transfer cc or personal loan, maybe just do it for 10k of that 15k? Focus on the remaining 5k on the credit card since it'll be tied to a higher APR soon, but would also provide you that fire under your butt for motivation to get that 1/3 paid off quick since it'll be costing you. Good luck",

Set the balance to autopay for the duration of the 0% BT period if you can swing it, or the term of the personal loan, so that you don't forget to pay it off. If you can get another 18 months interest free for ex, that's $833 and change per month for the duration of the 18 months.\n\nDon't touch your 401k - that's for your retirement and it's too costly to take a distribution. If you have to pay the 28% you're probably better off in the immediate term using it to pay down your balance. If you have $2k/month to put towards this you'll probably be done in less than a year.\n\nOnce it's all paid off, you need to set up automatic transfers for that $2k/month to various places where you can't spend it. 401k, Roth IRA and HSA are great tools for this. If you make $100k/year you should have at least $30k in liquid cash savings and that includes the contributions portion of anything you have in a Roth IRA as that can be withdrawn anytime.",

A 12% debt consolidation loan is not more debt, its refinancing the debt so you\u2019ll only pay half the interest. The 12% interest is yearly interest so it\u2019s not like you\u2019ll pay that much automatically. As long as there\u2019s no prepayment penalty you can pay it quicker than whatever is the term of the loan you take out (I always go a little longer on term to give more flexibility with payments but that could result in a higher interest rate.)\n\nAlso if it\u2019s your Credit Score you\u2019re worried about, using more than 30% of your credit limit negatively impacts your credit score so I\u2019d imagine the inquiry for the refinancing loan would be offset by paying down that balance with the loan. \n\nBasically just do the loan to pay off the CC and pay it down quick.",

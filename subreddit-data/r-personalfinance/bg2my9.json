    "postText": "I'm not 100% sure how well this fits here (it is financial), but I wanted to warn as many people as possible.\n\nLast week on Tuesday morning I was sitting at my desk and suddenly started getting emails. Lots, and lots, and lots of them. 30-40 every minute. They were clearly spam. Many of them had russian or chinese words, but random.\n\nI called one of our IT guys and he confirmed it was just me. And the traffic was putting a strain on our mail server so they disabled my account. By that point I have over 700 emails in my inbox. They were bypassing the spam filter (more on that later). After a different situation that happened  a few months ago, I've learned that things like this aren't random.\n\nSo I googled \"suddenly getting lots of spam\". Turns out, scammers do this to bury legitimate emails from you, most often to hide purchases. I started going through the 700+ emails one by one until I found an email from [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) confirming my purchase of 5 PC graphics cards (over $1000).\n\nI logged into my Amazon account, but didn't see an order. Then I checked - sure enough those cheeky bastards had archived the order too. I immediately changed my password and called Amazon..\n\nI still haven't heard from their security team HOW the breach happened (If they got into my amazon account by password, or did a \"one time login\" through my email.) The spam made it through our spam filter because the way this spam bomb was conducted, they use bots to go out to \"legitimate\" websites and sign your email up for subscription etc. So then I'd get an email from a random russian travel site, and our filters let it through.\n\nEither way - we got the order cancelled before it shipped, and my email is back to normal - albeit different passwords.\n\nAnd I honestly thought about shipping a box of dog crap to that address (probably a vacant house) but I decided against mailing bio-hazardous waste.\n\nEither way - if you see something suspicious - investigate!\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the great input everyone. Just finished putting 2FA on every account that allows it. Hopefully keep this from happening again!",

In fact, one of my clients had this happen last week to hide a credit card transaction of over $4,000.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith all of the data breaches that have been happening over the last few years this is unfortunately going to become more and more common. Here's a few suggestions:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. Use a password manager and use secure passwords. Using the password generator in the password manager is the best approach if at all possible.\n2. Setup 2FA on every account that you can, especially your e-mail accounts. Use an authentication like Google Authenticator and use SMS as a last resort.\n3. Be wary of sites that you sign up for and what information you provide.\n4. Regularly check your computer for malware/viruses. There are several out there that install \"key loggers\" on your computer or device to intercept your passwords as you type them in. Running regular checks of your devices with multiple scanners (Malwarebytes, ESET online scanner, Emsisoft Emergency Kit, TDSSKILLER, etc) is the best way to make sure you are clean.\n5. Setup alerts on all financial accounts, particularly on bank and credit card accounts. I have alerts setup for any transaction $1.00 or more (or whatever the minimum is) and receive SMS and e-mail alerts the moment a transaction happens.\n\nGlad you caught this so quickly and avoided a much bigger problem. Amazon's customer service is the best in the industry so I am not sure why that experience was \"weird\" for you. You mentioned they were dodgy. I would imagine this situation was not something that the lower level customer service reps deal with. They're likely used to the typical \"process my refund\", \"cancel my order\", etc type phone calls. The great thing about Amazon is it's very easy to cancel an order via the online portal. Change your password and setup 2FA.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat other scammers do in these cases if they have access to your e-mail is setup a filter to have these e-mails go straight to trash. They could setup a filter that would have any e-mails coming from Amazon bypass your inbox and go straight to trash. Honestly, this would have been the better way for them to do it but I would imagine they likely didn't have access to your e-mail account, which is why they wanted to flood the account instead.",

Yes, we don't believe they had access to the email.  \n\n\nBy dodgy, I just mean that they kept saying \"we will be in touch in 48 hours\" but didn't. I used chat to ask them and the response was \"2 more days please\". Then after 2 days \"We don't see a record of escalation to security team, we will do that now (5 days later).\"   \n\n\nTurned out that it had been escalated and someone didn't close the ticket out. But they still won't tell me if they logged in directly or did a one time login.   \n\n\nI just turned on 2FA. Thanks!",

We may end up doing a lot of dirty work (custom versions of our products installed, verbose logging, all kinds of profiling, etc). Usually there's one or two developers involved, someone from the support team and someone who works for the client. We may end up fixing the problem right then and there or figure out that we need to address the issue with a later update. We, the developers, never inform the client or the support people about what the issue was or how we aim to fix it, that's not our job. Furthermore, there's a big chance that telling support about technical issues and their fix will be poorly understood and create communication problems. On top of that, even if I consider the fix trivial and I want to rush a patch in the next two hours, the person who decides what is released and when might have other plans. So for a lot of big companies developers just don't inform support about how the issue was fixed or investigated because than can create problems or can even end up in lies being told to the client.",

Also SMS is unencrypted so people can listen in with a device like the Stingray.\n\nEdit: missed in their comment they said to avoid SMS. I'm providing the reason why though :)\n\nAlso there was a time where many Youtubers got hacked because they used SMS 2FA.",

They then call the FedEX guy and schedule a pick-up, he shows up at your doorstep saying he's here for a package - you assume it's for the video cards to be returned, and you hand it to him, unknowingly shipping $1k worth of video cards to the guy who got into your account.\n\nHad this happen to one of the dumbest coworkers I've ever had.

It was a ten dollar charge or so, followed by a purchase of about 600 bucks.\n\nThe second time was after we had changed all of our banking over USAA. I made the mistake of buying a coffee and a snack at the cafe inside Fry's Electronics. My second purchase was almost a grand in computer parts so I could build my new gaming rig. USAA locked my accounts down and, before I could even unlock my phone to look in the app to see what was up, they called to verify the charge. Love you USAA. They verified who I was in a couple of ways then unlocked all my crap. Embarrassing but worth it.",

They go straight to whomever has intercepted your SIM card, thereby bypassing two-step authentication.\n\nTwo-factor authentication (which is technically different from two-step authentication) requires using not just your password, but also a physical or digital key you carry with you. It typically is something like a six-digit number that changes every minute or so which you get from that physical key or from your digital key, like Google Authenticator. It\u2019s an app you can download from the Apple Store of Google Play Store and you can use it to authenticate logins to Google (or course), Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and yes, Reddit.\n\n\n\nEdit: here\u2019s an article about SIM card swapping/hijacking. Basically, your phone number was never meant to be a security measure, but that\u2019s how a lot of us have been using them. They are surprisingly easy to hijack. Even if your phone company protects your account with a PIN you have to know if you call them directly, hackers have been bribing cell phone employees to hand over that data. Don\u2019t use your phone number for security (SMS).\n\nhttps://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/vbqax3/hackers-sim-swapping-steal-phone-numbers-instagram-bitcoin",

Could have been way worse for me; especially if I'd saved my credit card info to the Best Buy account.\n\nBut the lesson learned: I signed up for 1Password and started generating unique passwords for all of my accounts, including those I only use infrequently, and activating 2-factor authentication wherever possible.",

I use 1Password as well, but there are others. You only have to remember one PASSPHRASE (do not make your master password under 20 chars) and you\u2019ll basically be able to generate different passwords for every website you use. I typically set mine to be 20 chars, mix of numbers, letters, and symbols.  So when Facebook had its breach recently, 1Password let me know because it uses data from haveibeenpwned.com and I was able to change it to a new randomly generated password, but also obviously I couldn\u2019t be caught in a cross-site issue since it was unique anyways.",

If you use a gmail account or a live account (other work as well, but not yahoo), you can create email aliases by simply adding +something to you email (eg. myemail@gmail.com could be myemail+whatever@gmail.com).  This will go to the same email.  So when you sign up for an account at Amazon, use myemail+amazon@gmail.com.  When you sign up for Ebay, use myemail+ebay@gmail.com. Do this with every single website you sign up for.  Then if you start getting spam, you know where it came from (and you can block emails just from that address).  You might want to do something different if a person is actually going to look at the email.  I was car shopping and used something similar to uselessemail+dealername@gmail.com and they weren't very amused.",

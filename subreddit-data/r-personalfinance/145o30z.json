    "postText": "My wife and I are 40. Two children in public grade school.  Gross household income is $200,000. Net is $116,000 after insurance and retirement contributions.\n\nI've always wanted a Jeep Wrangler as a \"summer car\". and my wife says I should \"live a little\" and not be like my father, who refuses to spend his money on anything. My in-laws farm and I can keep the \"other car\" there during the season I'm not using it for.\n\nAssets:\n\n* $38,000 cash savings\n* $130,000 brokerage account\n* $120,000 kid's college funds\n* $600,000 house &amp; existing cars\n* $525,000 Retirement accounts\n\nDebt/Expenses\n\n* $280,000 mortgage @ 3.0% interest rate. $2,000/month.\n* $10,000/year in after school care\n\nI would probably put down $5,000-8,000 and take out a loan on the rest. Max payment would be $350/month. Logicistically I'm not worried about it, I am wondering if it is something we can afford. Thanks!",

So in this hypothetical situation, you would be getting a positive 1% out of your money (-2% from the loan and +3% for your investment).\n\n\nIn my personal opinion, you should consider if the peace of mind that you get from the car being paid off is worth more than whatever the potential gain of taking a loan might be",

If you can fit the payment into your budget and the terms are the loan are reasonable, I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t enjoy it. A payment of $350 is actually fairly cheap for a vehicle right now, as long as the interest rate is reasonable. We do all this work so we can enjoy our lives, not just the life after retirement when our bodies are slowing down. I\u2019m not a fan of the Ramsey loyalists for this reason. My parents had this attitude and now they\u2019re mid-70s trying to travel the world and worried that they only have a few years left to do it.

Your underwater the moment you roll it off the lot.  Guess put larger down payment so not underwater and pay it in 3-4 years and then only crazy downside is depreciation.  Can offset that a bit by not getting the overpriced fully loaded model but rule of thumb is lose 50% of value within first five years so used is still typically a better deal but as always shop around.  I have seen new stripped down models cheaper than used ones.\n\nWill also note particularly with Wranglers the rear independent newer ones ride way smoother but yeah your going to pay for it.\n\nIs buying this a good financial decision almost never but you do have to actually have some fun in your life and as long as not affecting bill or retirement payments not a big deal.  Just make sure your buying if for yourself and not to impress your friends and go explore interesting places.",

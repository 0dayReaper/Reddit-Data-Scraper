    "postText": "TLDR: child support office is erroneously ruining my credit without my knowledge. How can I repair my credit?\n\nI've been applying for mortgages recently and was told, to my surprise, my county's child support office has been reporting almost half my payments as late, in error, for more than 5 years.\n\nThe entire time I've had this support order I've been employed full time and the payments have been taken out of my checks automatically.\n\nEven more surprisingly, there are payments being reported as 'over 90 days late' from April of 2023... less than 90 days ago.\n\nI called my caseworker, who was unsurprised and stated they deal with this almost every day. She stated it is due to my being paid biweekly instead of twice per month. Being paid biweekly creates \"a mismatch within their system\" which causes a late payment to be triggered since the payment is due before I get paid. Which make sense, being paid biweekly means my first check of the month can be as late as the 13th of the month, and I am almost never paid on the 1st or 15th.\n\nAnyone who has child support in this county and is paid biweekly has this happening to them without their knowledge.\n\nMy case worker said she can ask her supervisor to issue a \"credit suppression\". When I asked her to explain what that is, she said on the 22nd of every month they issue a report out to the credit agencies and a credit suppression would stop that report. It seems a suppression would prevent the problem from getting worse... but wouldn't fix the real problem which is the strike against my credit report and continual reports of late payments.\n\nHow do I fix this? Should I move forward with the suppression? My credit score is still about 750, but that doesn't matter because when lenders look at me in-depth, this strike comes up as a huge risk factor. Should I contact a lawyer about this?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I've seen similar letters used for other situations and the lender was fine to proceed with them. More than likely getting it corrected will take a significant amount of time, this may help in the short term.",

You\u2019ll then explain why the reporting is wrong but can\u2019t be fixed. What lenders hate are surprises. It is also a sure bet that they\u2019ve seen this before. It\u2019ll entirely possible that your lender has the same problem on their credit report.\n\nAs for solutions, I would ask if the child support payments could be taken from your bank account and not paid from employment garnishment. If so, you\u2019d make sure the money was always there on the 1st and the 15th.\n\nSide story: I know a guy who had a court ordered employment garnishment from his paychecks. He had always sent his child support on time and sometimes sent it early if the ex needed it. However, she asked for child support through garnishment because she \u201cwanted a paycheck, too\u201d. \ud83d\ude04 The problem was the guy\u2019s boss hated the arrangement and hated the ex. He purposely would hold the child support until the last possible day to send it and still be compliance. The ex would be furious but there was nothing the guy could do because the money had been already deducted from his check.",

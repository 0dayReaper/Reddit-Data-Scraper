    "postText": "We were going to pay for a home remodel with money from savings but now my wife wants to put her savings into an annuity and take out a HELOC. We already have a HELOC with available credit of $100K.\n\nI don't want to take out a new HELOC for a larger amount. She said that she can qualify on her own for a larger HELOC. But I don't want to have our jointly owned house to have another lien on it. I told here that I won't sign anything. Hopefully she cannot close on a HELOC without my consent, but has anyone else run into this?\n\nIt's insane because the interest rate on a new HELOC is a lot more than the return that she is guaranteed on annuity (which is uninsured). But some annuity salesperson is offering her a 20% bonus on funds that she puts into an annuity, which sounds fishy to me.",

I told my wife that she should not trust this person if they are pushing annuities from problem providers.\n\nI also received an e-mail from someone I know: \"I found a fixed rate annuity that is offering a fixed rate of 45% for the next 3 years.\"\n\nI am trying to at least get her to consider a top-rated insurer if she is going to buy an annuity, which are not insured.",

Maybe you can approach the issue by suggesting something more like ETFs where the return isn't based on some sus salesperson? \n\nI wouldn't suggest financing that either given the way HELOC rates are going though.",

She may not understand that HELOCs are not insured. She had had the remodeling all planned out in terms of financing, using savings for most of it, with $100,000 borrowed from our existing HELOC until she retired later in the year and could use some of her 401K money. There is some tax advantage in using a HELOC, since the interest is tax-deductible, versus taking money from a 401K which is taxable. But the 401K money will be taxable eventually anyway, though when our income is lower.\r  \n\r  \nI was not really in favor of such an extensive remodeling, I just wanted to remodel the kitchen and not do an addition. The remodeling and addition is likely to cost $450K. It is not likely to increase the value of the house by more than half of that amount. This is not a mansion. This is Silicon Valley where sixty year old tract homes sell for $3 million.\r  \n\r  \nI am reducing my expenditures now since we split expenses about evenly, even though I pay more despite earning significantly less. She pays the mortgage payment of about $2300 while I pay for everything else including the property tax, all insurance, and all other bills which amount to an average of $4800. This made sense so she could maximize her employer matching retirement account savings. She will also get a pension while I will only get Social Security plus income from a rental.",

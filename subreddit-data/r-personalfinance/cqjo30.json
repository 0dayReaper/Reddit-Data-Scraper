    "postText": "Hi Personal Finance!\n\nI see an awful lot of threads here about people wondering how on earth they'll possibly survive this horrible doomsday recession that is just absolutely going to happen any day now.  Here's some tips:\n\n1) There is not a gigantic country-destroying recession that is coming to ruin your life in the coming weeks.  Talking heads have been predicting one ever since the last recession.  The current news cycle is little more than fear-mongering (full disclosure: I used to be a journalist).  IF the current indicators that people are looking at end up holding true, it's still well over a year before things are \"expected\" to go south.  Plenty of time to shore up those savings accounts, make sure you're budgeting properly (see below), etc.\n\n2) The last recession was called the Great Recession for a reason - it was a harder-hitting one than those that came before.  And since it was largely based on a housing crisis, it felt even worse because people were losing their homes due to ridiculous mortgages that they never should have been offered, or agreed to, in the first place.  Which leads me to...\n\n3) Just be smart.  Are you living within your means now?  Great!  Make sure your emergency fund is in good shape, and continue about your business.  If you're overspending, take a look at your budget and see what you can cut out of it.  This is something you should be doing regardless of how the markets look.  Find a cheaper cell phone plan, ditch that $100 / mo cable bill, subscribe to a slower internet package, go out to eat less often, etc.  \n\n4) \"What about my stocks?  Should I sell all my stocks?\"  NO!!!  Do.  Not.  Sell.  Your.  Stocks.  The only exception here is if you really are completely and utterly broke otherwise and absolutely need the money.  Look, I invested almost all of my life savings in late September last year.  And then watched a LOT of it go away - on paper.  But guess what?  It's all back already, and then some - because I didn't panic sell.  In fact, **the best thing you can do in a recession is buy more stock!**  A bad market just means that stocks are on sale.  Who doesn't love a discount?  Again, I wouldn't advise buying unless you have the budget to do so.  \n\nSo there you have it, friends.  The world isn't ending.  Be smart with your money, use some common sense, and be prepared to make some small sacrifices in the short term *if* a recession hits.\n\nupdate 1: thanks for the silver!\n\nupdate 2: I was working my first \"real\" job in 2008, but the pay was so bad that I was not investing much.  Then over the next nine year, I didn't invest one single cent out of fear of another big market drop (just left it in savings).  I ran the numbers, and if I had been investing in the S&amp;P 500 at my original rate that whole time, I'd stand to be up about $200,000 at retirement.  **I potentially lost $200k by not investing out of fear of a market turn.**",

I am not overly concerned about what the resell value will be as whatever home I buy I plan to be there basically until I need something like assisted living in 50+ years. My concern however is the current high prices. I would like to buy a home (not even a big one, 2 bed would be great) that I can pay off quickly (15-20 years instead of 30) so I can put additional money into investments and retirements. With current prices, it is hard to find anything that won't have me making payments until I am 60+.",

I have very little in retirement savings, I rent, and I have yet to make a salary over $40k.  I'm in my mid-40s.  It wasn't that I wasn't worried about retirement before, it's that I was married to and had children with someone who came from generational poverty and didn't understand why this was important.  We're divorced now, and while I'm doing the best I ever had, I still feel behind the 8-ball.  I'm cleaning up my credit from the divorce while trying to save for a down payment.  I feel like the only way that I'll be able to retire is if I own a house and pay it off fast, even if it is in a bad area.  At least then my housing costs won't climb as fast as they have as a tenant.",

Other than a foreclosure here or there or a short sale here or there, I really doubt there will be a macro-event that will cause home prices to dip.\n\nIn fact I wouldn't be surprised if the impact is even more costly real estate as builders tend to be first companies to go under in any recession once funding dries up.

Plus it feels super nice to have a low cost. But that roof replacement or whatever is expensive. I wonder if this recession will really hit housing prices that hard. In my area demand is high, there aren't enough rentals.. etc. Housing is still going up. I expect it to ignore any coming small recession. Seems like interest rates are in a decent spot right now and might dip a bit. I think it's too early to call. A year ago I though interest rates were gonna be stable or go up a bit.  It is nice to lock in rent price. \n\nI was lucky to buy around 2013, so that was a good time. But the decision was made based on long term affordability and comparing to rents.",

The Great Recession was terrible because people lost their jobs and subsequently their homes.\n\nFor the question you\u2019re actually asking, nobody knows if prices or rates will go up or down, so who can say? It\u2019s really a personal question based on a combination of factors: home price, interest rate, net income, emergency fund, willingness to stay put for years, willingness to perform or pay for maintenance, etc. Only your friend can answer all those questions.\n\nFor comparison, the stock market tends to move quicker in both directions. I debated this about 5 years back while rates were low and everyone was predicting a stock market crash, but ultimately decided I just wasn\u2019t ready yet and plowed money into the stock market instead. A couple years after that, the stock market was up, home prices were higher but rates were still low and I decided to take the plunge on a house. Was I better off waiting? Financially, maybe or maybe not, but emotionally, definitely. I don\u2019t actually know if it was better financially, because I don\u2019t care - there\u2019s no point in doing all the math since I\u2019m happy with my decision anyway. Point is: it\u2019s good to think about financial decisions logically, but it\u2019s also good to trust your gut and act on emotion.",

And only buy the house that you really want. \n\nThat's all there is. It's not an investment. Think of buying a house as picking a place to rent, but you sign a 5 year lease instead of 1. Do you really want it? Do you need it? And can you afford it?\n\nI repeat. It. Is. NOT. An. Investment. Not an investment. Not an investment. So important. \n\nSo since a house is not an investment, there is no need to wonder about the market today or tomorrow.\n\nIf you want to play the real estate market, go buy funds that represent that market. But a house is a place to live. I swear. You think you are emotional with your stocks? Wait until you are emotional about the cabinets in your house. It'll drive you fucking insane if you think it's an investment.",

You roll it over to an IRA account. If you take an actual disbursement you'll incur a big tax liability. Income taxes on the disbursement plus a 10% penalty.\n\nI'm 50 so I can personally recollect five recessions, and three since I started working. I graduated college into the 1990 recession. The 2001 recession really came and went so fast most people only saw it in the rear-view mirror. Then 2008. The double-dip recession in the early 1980's actually had higher peak unemployment that the 2008 recession. \n\nI once asked my dad, who's 78 now, what period he thought was the worst economics in his life and he didn't even point to a recession. He says it was the stagflation period in the late 1970's with the high inflation and high interest rates. He just says \"that was awful\".",

In 2008, I was a few years into my first \"real job\". Decent but not great money, solid hours, and insurance + 401k. Early in 2008, I had the company match of 3% coming out of my check. I too, freaked out when the market dropped 6/8/10% in a quarter. By midsummer '08, I was convinced it was over. (Boy was I wrong) \n\nMy meager $4000 401k balance just kept dropping...and dropping...and dropping.\n\nI had to do something. Every month, I kept bumping my contributions by a percent or two. Stocks are on sale, right?.....RIGHT???? By January 2009 -- Obama time -- my contributions were up to 11% of income. But still that balance either dropped or held steady around $4k. I quit watching the market, and quit checking my Vanguard account on the regular.\n\nFast forward six years after that to 2014: I quit that job due to shitty management and got a better one. Statements came in the mail that I ignored...halfway thru 2014 I opened one. WTF $65k in that account but how?\n\nOh yeah...5 years at that same 11% contribution. I kinda forgot.....\n&gt; \n&gt; It makes me wonder what people here will actually do in a real recession. \n\nIn April 2009 (after the recovery started), the market was down 3% midday.  My manager called Vanguard in a panic and moved everything to cash. I don't know when he moved it back, but March-December 2009 was one of the best market bull runs ever.",

How long until it catches back up? 2 years? 3 years?  If you are 5 years out, you have plenty of time to recover from a 20% drop.\n\nSay a recession hits in 12 months, and it climbs 8% before, then crashes 20%, you are down 12%. How long until it catches back up? You are 1 year forward already, but now it only has to catch up 12%, so only 1 year? 2 years? 5 years is still fine.\n\nWhat if you need the money in 2 years? Well, it can be anywhere from up 20% to down 20% in exactly 2 years. If you are willing to gamble, leave it in and see what happens. If you are NOT willing to gamble, put it in something safe. \n\nThat's my opinion. I have put my HSA (healthcare) money in safe savings rather than stock because I expect to use it within 12 months and I am very risk averse with my Healthcare money.\n\nBut my retirement money is staying in exactly the same ratios it has been for the last 2.5 years. I have well over 30 years until that is being used. So at the height of the bubble, or the deepest part of the recession, my ratios will remain the same.",

If you're going to need the money in the shorter term then the stocks can continue to fall and you lose out. If you focus too much on individual stocks rather than an index, you risk too much exposure: a recession will kill some companies entirely, and you need to avoid that",

If your employer laid off people in 2008, you've got some prep and planning to do. If you're looking to buy a house, you may really want to think about where, when, and/or if you buy. The piece of this that's universal is trimming the fat out of your budget. That's something we all should do frequently, regardless of the state of the economy. Personally, I've shifted funds from low-interest debt repayment into savings recently.",

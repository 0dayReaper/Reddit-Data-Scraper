    "postText": "Recently, I started a second job at a grocery store. I make decent money at my day job (49k+ but awesome benefits, largest employer besides the state in the area) but I have 100k in student loans and $1000 in credit cards I want gone. I was cashiering yesterday, and one of my coworkers came into my store, and into my line!\n\nI know he came to my line to chat, as he looked incredibly surprised when I waved at him and said hello. As we were doing the normal chit chat of cashier and customer, he asked me, \"Aren't you embarrassed to be working here?\" I was so taken aback by his rudeness, I just stumbled out a, \"No, it gives me something to do.\" and finished his transaction.\n\nAs I think about it though, no freaking way am I embarrassed. Other then my work, I only interact with people at the dog park (I moved here for my day job knowing no one). At the grocery I can chat with all sorts of people. I work around 15 hours a week, mostly on weekends, when I would be sitting at home anyways.\n\nI make some extra money, and in the two months I've worked here, I've paid off $300 in debt, and paid for a car repair, cash. By the end of the year I'll have all [EDIT: credit card] debt paid off, and that's with taking a week off at Christmas time.\n\nBe proud of your progress guys. Don't let others get in your head. \n\nTL, DR: Don't be embarrassed for your past, what matters is you're fixing it.",

            "comment": "Once, when I was around 19, at a doctor appointment, as a new patient my doctor asked me what I did for employment. I replied, \"I'm just a cashier at a small family run market.\"  He asked me what I meant by \"just a cashier?\". And I said, \"well- that's all I do. The job isn't really glamorous or anything\". He looked me right in my eyes and said \"nobody is 'just' something. It takes everyone doing their part to make the world go around\". \n\nIt gave me an appreciation and a realization about how everyone contributes, regardless of how \"sexy\" their job is. ",

I think the religion of medicine as a calling--that it's this glorious, profound, noble thing that sets us apart (above) from everyone else--is damaging and makes us lose touch not only with ourselves but with our patients.

It's been a recurring contract for me, but usually for only a few months (or in this case weeks) each year.\n\nI've actually kind of given up on the job searching at this point and started focusing on developing my own javascript game engine for building retro RPGs. I built a working prototype demo, and I'm now in the process of refactoring the code base for the engine to clean it up and work out the kinks. The plan is to have a polished demo by December, then I'll probably set up a kickstarter and start trying to develop my own business model around it. I have a ton of content ideas for once the engine is complete.\n\n",

Did the entire restaurant over about a week. \n\nI get one of two reactions from people. It's either \"wow, your restaurant must have been really clean.\" (It was, the owner was very particular about cleanliness.) Or it's \"wow, I would have walked out, I'd never do such menial work.\" If it's the 2nd response, I generally know we're probably not going to be great friends.\n\nI personally feel that I am not above any kind of honest and good work that needs to be done, and if I had to feed my family I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I'm thankful that I don't, and really appreciate those who work their asses off making my life better. \n\nSo tell them that maybe? ",

He plans to keep working there after retiring because he wants to do something and have some kind of schedule. He's also planning to try and learn some Spanish and was talking about how many of his coworkers can help him since they're native Spanish speakers.

I work a day job that pays well enough on its own, but I took on a part time job at a grocery store just for some extra spending money. People at both my jobs know where I work and I get praised for my hustle. Most people know that I can sustain my life with just my day job; so I get asked why I still work at the grocery store often. My answer is that I have goals in my life I want to achieve, and having that second job helps me achieve those goals. \n\nIn my day job, I get to interact with probably 1/4 of the people on my floor, every day, same people. At my part time job, I get to interact with at least 5x the amount of co-workers and customers on top of that.

It's not always about finances.\n\nFuck anybody who shits on someone for having two jobs, regardless if it's two part time jobs, two grocery store jobs, etc. I respect the shit out of people who hold two or more jobs because it shows that that they're hard working people.",

Not all that much. Have a family? It's gone way sooner than that.\n\nCombine that with a poor education and not-great job prospects and you have a recipe for poor financial health despite a nice upper-class salary they only got for 2-3 years.",

He had a job one summer in the middle of nowhere on this beautiful country estate. It was owned by a man who had started his own construction company. He did really well and every summer he'd host this huge blowout for his employees at his place. It was a 400+ head, steak and lobster, open bar type affair on the grounds of his beautiful country home.\n\nI was like 14 or 15 and working the butter pot (my job: unwrap stick after stick of butter, melt it, serve it up). A popular, but not mean spirited girl from my highschool was there with her friends. Her dad worked for the company.\n\n\"Hi godbois!\" she said, approaching me as I unloaded a cooler of butter from the van. We chit chatted as I hauled the butter to the kitchen, then she got a weird look. \"Does your dad work for (construction company)?\" I said no, I was working for my uncle, who was catering the party. She kind of got a confused look at her face and wandered off after saying some half hearted \"ok, well see you later!\" or something.\n\nI talked about it later with my dad and that I was a little embarrassed that a girl from my school saw me and seemed embarrassed for me. He ran me through the logic that I was now $200 richer (for a day's work, at 14/15), I was doing a job that needed to be done, I was helping people have a really good time, and that you should never, EVER be embarrassed if you're doing good work for a fair wage, no matter what that work is. Plus, he said, I would have just spent the Saturday watching TV anyway.\n\nIt's stuck with me all these years. My dad had a lot of faults. But he was a really hard worker. I'm glad that he took the time out of his day to talk to me about it. I think about that conversation every so often and it makes me proud.\n\n",

I grew up as a poor kid in the U.K. With separated parents. Live with mum, who never had any money and we lived in social housing and on benefits (the welfare system in the U.K. Is really good, but a lot of people depend on it.)\n\nMy siblings were what a lot of people consider trash; drug dealers, addicts etc, and from our background it was considered a success to even have a job in a supermarket. \n\nI, somehow, had/have a naturally high rate of retention and managed to get into a Russel Group Uni (our equivalent to the Ivy League) on the back of it. Since graduating, I've found myself considering jobs such as at cashier level 'beneath me' (quick to point out, I don't mean that I am above the people who do these jobs, but that my brain tells me I'm too qualified to do their job, if that makes sense? Still have all the respect for the people in these roles.) \n\nThe reason I'm saying this is because my background has given me something to prove, and I don't think that's ever going to go. I could own my own company or become the Prime Minister and I'll still feel like I have something to prove. While I wish it wasn't the case, I get SO embarrassed when people think I'm poor, instead of just accepting it. \n\nThe reason I say this is cos maybe you can cut the co-worker some slack? There's every chance he's from a similar background, and simply hasn't seen others in a role as high as his while growing up. It doesn't make him any better as a person, but he's probably just insecure about how he got to where he is. Just a thought. \n\nOn the flip side, thanks for sharing! It's awesome that you're doing what you're doing, and I wish you all the best! It's also shown me that I need to relax a bit myself, so maybe I'll try to now. ",

Plus, its a really great place to make new friends and have strangers recommend cool places around the city. ",

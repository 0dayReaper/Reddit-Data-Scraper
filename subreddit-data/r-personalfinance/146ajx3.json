    "postText": "Hi all,\n\nI\u2019ve been car shopping since the beginning of this year. Every single dealership I go to has high APRs from 10 - 16%. I have a good credit score (730) and credit history. I am so tired and exhausted. Even the credit unions around my area have high APRs. Lowest I\u2019ve seen is 5.49% at Wescom. Maybe I\u2019m just really bad at car shopping but the only cheap cars I\u2019ve seen are ones with salvage title or really high miles. I\u2019m trying to get a car that\u2019s 3-6 years old and isn\u2019t going to make me go broke. I\u2019m going to CarMax today to check a car out but the APR is 10%. Hoping I can work something out or finance through my chase bank that is offering 6%. Any advice? I need a car because I drive all over Los Angeles so waiting it out is not the best option for me atm.",

If you wait, you may find better deals. Considering you live in LA with it's high cost of living, you should be patient look for bargains.",

Even though the car you want might be several thousand dollars more, I'm sure a lower interest rate will help out with payments and maybe even save you money long term.",

Cars depreciate in value which is why you should only buy a vehicle that fits your needs because at some point, it'll break down and be worth next to nothing. That is it. It is a tool to be used for transportation. You go out of your way to buy a 600 horsepower v8, you buy it because it's got 600 horsepower and not because you're planning on selling it to make a profit.",

If you're paying 3% higher interest rate for a 10k less vehicle, I'm not really seeing a significant difference in interest. Maybe a couple thousand more, but if the payments are lower and I'm getting a car with 12 miles as opposed to 72000 miles, I'd take the lower payment and newer car. Unless you buy a high mile car for as little as possible, you're over paying regardless of used or new.",

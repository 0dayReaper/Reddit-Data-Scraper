    "postText": "I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m just searching for this incorrectly but I\u2019m trying to find a tool that allows me to input my monthly income then will give me an outline on how much I should be spending on things like rent, car payment, debt, etc. based on where I live. Most tools I\u2019m seeing require me to input that info but I\u2019m more just wanting a guideline that I can follow to start spending reasonably, given I just graduated college and don\u2019t have a car/rent payment yet",

                    "comment": "Correct. The most you might get is something like the 50/30/20 guide that says 50% of your income goes to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings.\n\nNeeds are generally rent, basic food, and utilities like water and electricity. Internet is considered a want...but if you work from home and use it all the time for work you might shift it to needs.\n\nBudgets are personal so you will not find something that gives you a percentage breakdown for every category beyond the general guideline. Someone who makes minimum wage in an expensive area may not even be able to save 3% much less 20%. Someone who makes a high income in a cheaper place may spend way more than 30% on wants because they can afford it.",

Someone might need cable TV and a landline, others are good with a cell phone and over the air/streaming TV.   Get one of the blank apps and fill in what your currently spend, then adjust over time the categories that need more.less money",

But since you're just starting out and maybe feel a little clueless, you might find it useful to Google things like average cost of living calculators for your area, typical budgets for your age group, etc. This isn't exactly what you want, and most data you find will probably be based on families with kids. But it will at least give you a starting point. You could also spend some time searching this subreddit for posts where people breakdown their budgets and get advice, which might also give you some idea of what's normal.\n\nMy advice would be to try to keep rent down to no more than 25-30% of your gross income (though that's not possible some places), try to put 10-15% of your salary into retirement savings (though that's also not always possible), and keep track of your expenses for 3 months to see how much you're spending on different categories. Then make adjustments to how you spend based on that data.\n\nIf you have to make a major financial decision (like buying a car) and you don't know what you can afford, maybe make a post here asking something like \"Can I afford an $X car on $Y salary?\" \n\nGood luck!",

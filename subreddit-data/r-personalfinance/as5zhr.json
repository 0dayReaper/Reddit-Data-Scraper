    "postText": "There are 4 basic reasons people came in to purchase a car.\n\nCurrent car is messy:\nI sold a ton of cars to people who's current car they hated simply because it was dirty. Some elbow grease or paying for a good detail could have saved them $20k.\n\nWanted new technology:\nI sold $50k cars weekly because of Bluetooth capabilities. No matter how old your car is, you can add this to any existing car for around $200. Cheaper if your DIY.\n\nWanted it as a status symbol:\nCars always look amazing at a dealership where they are waxed, clean, and smothered in Armor All and tire shine. In two weeks the difference between your old car and your new car will probably be negligible. The whole status symbol thing really only lasts a few weeks. Most of your peers don't know the difference between a new and much older models if they are both dirty.\n\nMechanical problems:\nThis is the only reason I would advise anyone to purchase a car. Eventually the repairs get to the point where its more expensive to keep it than to move on. If you are buying a car for anyother reason than this... don't!\n\nEDIT: Reading the comments, I figured I should address some general thoughts. \n\nSafety isn't something I meantioned before, but probably should have. Regardless of how reliable a car is, if you are driving something with a rusted frame and 20 year old safety features its time to upgrade (assuming you can afford it). My wife and kids drive in a 5 star crash rating car with every modern safety feature. We have chose to be stingy in other places in our finances so we can afford to have a car with these types of features. Its worth a little bit of money to us to know our family is safe and to be able to see when backing out of the driveway. \n\nThat moment when repairs out way the cost of upgrading is tricky. I have been burned several times by spending money on repairs that I thought were a good investment only to have more and more repairs pile up. I wish I knew some perfect rule for this. I don't. I have repaired cars I shouldn't have and I have gotten rid of cars that probably would have been great with minor investments. ",

            "comment": "The dirty comment resonates hard.\n\nI bought a (new to me) car about 4 1/2 years ago because my old car had several thousand dollars more worth of repairs than it was worth. Over the last year or so I hadn't taken super great care of my car, interior or exterior, and since it was over 100,000 miles I was considering getting a new one. My boyfriend convinced me to just take it in to get detailed. $200 later and it feels like a brand new car again. I completely fell back in love. It'll be paid off in a couple months and still has years worth of life. Worth every penny to have someone do the dirty work and clean it up for me. ",

It doesn't mean it's less reliable per se, (though it likely is) it just makes economic sense to scrap the thing earlier. Many Taurus and Camry models still have a long life left after their value stoops to $4,000 because repairs are so much cheaper ",

But thats before tax, tag, title, interest rate and maybe their negative equity. \n\nIf they bad just told me up front they wanted to be at $300 a month with X amount down and trade or no trade I can help them better. If they are paying upfront for the entire car then they could just say that upfront also. \n\nThere are some good buyers that really do want to shop by the price of the car and not payments.

You are a thousand times larger than they are, and every tiny move you make is the equivalent of a significant earthquake, so they know to avoid you. \n\nWhile people are correct that there is probably one near, I doubt you'll ever even see it unless you go looking; much less have it attack you. \n\nI used to have a spider living in the corner of my room (a wolf spider; typically more aggressive,  and not tiny, either). I could always see it unless it hid behind the leg of my bed (which it did when the cat came around)  and despite my intense dislike for spiders, I held off on the urge to capture it and toss it outside. which I tend to do for larger spiders, since smooshing them is gross and leaves a mess. And.....he never went anywhere aside from those two spots. I named him Lobo, and the thing even died there, as I got a little alarmed after not seeing him for a few days and went looking. Died of cold, curled up on my bed frame's leg. No a/c. \n\nWhich isnt to say thats always how it goes, as I seem to be some sort of spider whisperer. Theyve landed on my head a number of times, including a rather amusing morning where....well, I digress. \n\nIf you're very concerned, check the corners of your room, under your bed, and around your windows. That's usually where they hang around, and if those areas are clear you're good to go. You can also spray some particular oils on your bed that will help keep the curious ones away, but that's more often than not a waste of effort. Y'know, since they usually avoid us anyhow.\n\nPleasant dreams!\n\n",

The most glaring example was an older couple who had apparently been upgrading their minivan every single year for probably a decade consecutively. They always used their trade in as a down payment, took the absolute longest amortization available and got the highest trim level available. When they first came to me I thought \u201choly shit, this is the easiest sale ever\u201d. I assessed their trade, found them a minivan that fit their wants and desires and would pay me nicely as well, got them through the paperwork, sold them all the expensive BS like winter floor mats and snow tires (that they probably could have saved over $1500 on if they\u2019d just bought them elsewhere themselves) and sent them off to the finance office. \n\nI went about my day of cold/warm calls and lurking for \u201cups\u201d. \n\nAbout two hours after this couple had signed their bill of sale, I saw them quick-walking to their \u201cold\u201d minivan (which was literally 13 months old) and tear-ass out of that lot faster than anyone else I\u2019d seen before. \n\nI talked to the finance manager and asked why they didn\u2019t take the new van, because it had been made ready for delivery the instant I sent them into finance. Apparently their string of terrible financing had left them $250k upside down in car finance and no lenders anywhere would take them on. \n\nHoly fucking shit. \n\nTwo weeks later they were back and bought a very similar van, cash. (About $50k CDN)\n\nAgain, I went to the finance manager who\u2019d taken their cheque, and asked what the hell just happened. According to the finance manager they\u2019d remortgaged their mediocre suburban house, paid off their long string of year old minivans finances over 5 and 7 year terms, and used the last $50k to buy the new van in cash. \n\nJesus H Christ. \n\n25+ more years of mortgage payments on a home they\u2019d paid off decades ago and no nest egg leftover just so they could always be driving a brand new minivan. \n\n\nI\u2019d also asked the finance manager why they didn\u2019t just lease these vans if they were just going to put 15,000 kms on them and flip them. The answer she gave me was that \u201cthey won\u2019t lease anything because \u2018if you lease it, you don\u2019t own it\u2019\u201d. \n\nUltimate facepalm. \n\nIn the end I got my commission, and felt so dirtied by this and other similar sales that I quit within the month and went back to waiting tables in nice restaurants.

It took me all day to convince him to come back in. I sat down with him and was going through all the paperwork. And unbeknown to me, another salesman was selling the same SUV. My sales manager knew this and let us both sell the same SUV for about 3 hours. My customer ended up getting cheated out of the deal because my manager was waiting to see who he could screw over the most before letting the deal go through. ",

You'd be surprised the level of camaraderie there is between similar car owners.\n\nWhen I was looking at buying a car out of state (granted a bit on the niche side), someone drove 30 minutes out of their way, spent another 30 there, looking at the car and gave me a pretty detailed report including advice. \n\nRandom dude 'x' helped me install a part at his place.\n\nFor my non-niche daily driver, the camaraderie is a little less, but someone is always willing to help on the forums, at least by messaging.\n\nA few things you can do in future:\n\n- When you buy a cheap car, ask about a 6-month warranty.  Might be cheaper than you expect. And that should get you through the most likely time the vehicle would fail.\n\n- When buying a car, go with someone who isn't invested in it (i.e. not your spouse). Added bonus if they are mechanically inclined. People tend to overlook a few things either because they are tired of searching, or they are excited that they found something. Acquaintance is much less invested and likely to see things you miss. And for the love of god, listen to them when they try and dissuade you from pulling the trigger.\n\n- Make sure your test drive lasts at the very least for 15 minutes. You want to drive the car when it has just been started, and when it is warm. Different problems might show in both scenarios\n\n- While I'm not suggesting you wreck it, give the car a little bit of oomph during the test drive.\n\n- Pay attention to the bumpers, and how well the fitment is. You can usually tell if there was an accident based off that. And try and take a peak at the underside of the vehicle.\n\n- Get yourself a bluetooth OBD reader. It'll help for every one of your cars, and can also do a quick diagnostic check on the car you are test driving. It could also tell you if some codes haven't had the necessary time to be checked (i.e. they might have cleared some codes).\n\n- Finally, for the semi-ultimate peace of mind, pay an extra $200 or $300 to get a PPI (pre purchase inspection) at an authorized dealership. I have always done this. With private party sales, we usually have a gentleman's agreement that I'd pay for it, but if something major is found which wasn't disclosed, they pay me back.\n\nAfter you buy the car, it might surprise you how far a couple hundred dollars in tools and youtube could take you.\n \nmuch longer than I expected, sorry",

A lot of manufacturers have programs like this and I've purchased two great VWs this way.\n\nThe best deal I ever got, though, was buying a car on craigslist from a guy who was around retirement age.  If you look on craigslist and other used car markets, look for vehicles that were driven by/posted by older people.  And educated people who can use proper grammar and take decent pictures.  They tend to treat their cars better than younger and/or stupid people, they're pretty up front about the issues and there's often a fair amount of room in price negotiation.  My first VW Golf (RIP) was listed for $1800, and when I got there the owner showed me something marginal that he'd broken the day before and now dropped $100 from the asking price.  I knew I wanted the car already but that really solidified it for me.\n\nYMMV of course, and maybe I've just had good luck, but those couple things are worth a shot.",

The heater no longer worked and I had no AC. It was a former fleet vehicle, had a moon roof and it was beautiful.\n\nSadly, when I was 5 months pregnant I was rear ended, into a pine-tree, while pulling into my driveway. Air bags deployed, and the car was a total loss. A total loss, without gap insurance, and I was out of work for months. But, I still owed $1000 on the loan, after the insurance payed its part. My car did its job though. I hobbled away, mostly ok, and my baby was none the wiser, and born 4 months later.\n\nSince then I've owed a Mazda 3 (my husband convinced me to buy) but traded it in not too long after because it was too small. Then I got a Kia Sorento which I absolutely loved! I had it for 5 years, but my girls are at the age of wanting to take friends with them. Unfortunately, I got used to the luxury of heated seats, blu tooth, and backup cameras.\n\nI'm not joking, I teared up as I handed over the keys to my Kia, and bought a minivan. If I could have afforded to, I would have kept my Kia too. I love the van, and the extra features of remote start and heated rear seats and heated steering wheel, but I still miss my Kia.\n\nVery long story, cut short... Buy the GAP insurance! Also, check with your bank, or preferably credit union, because their GAP insurance rate is a lot cheaper than the dealership. ",

Trust me, it killed me to do it. \n\nJust out of high school I bought a 93 Nissan Sentra with 100k miles. Put on 125k more on it. That led to a 99 gmc jimmy. Bought it with 90k on it. Drove it to 160k. Then my first real mistake was an 08 jeep that I payed the most for (19k) and only got to 95k before the door liners rusted out with a repair cost of a good couple grand over its value. Granted I drove far less and it did last 6 full years and I'm in the northeast so it does happen. Hell in my drive way is still an 04 honda odyssey with 160k and while she ain't pretty she keeps chugging along.  All this to show I'm usually pretty big on keeping and maintaining cars until it's just simply not worth it anymore.  \n\nI had every intention of going the least expensive route possible but with a young family when I started taking a longer look at safety technology in cars I decided that it was worth the peace of mind to spend a little more. \n\nNow if the van dies everyone can fit in the highlander so you bet your sweet muffins daddy is getting the cheapest honda civic he can find!",

We bought brand new to also just get more good maintenance free full warranty years out of the car so we can focus on our young kids and not have to worry about problems.

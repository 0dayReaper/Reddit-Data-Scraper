    "postText": "Hello all. I know I am late to the game at the age of 36 years old. I didn't really make enough before and I didn't really care about anything up until recently. \n\nI have very little in retirement funds for my age and I have some questions regarding retirement funds.\n\n1) Currently I have a Roth 401k with my employer that matches what I put in up to 3%. If I understand correctly, the limit I can put in is $6,500 a year into this right? Does the amount my employer put in counts as part of the $6,500 amount?\n2) what happens if I put more than $6,500 in annually?\n3) for this fund, am I suppose to just leave it alone or am I suppose to set up where the funds are being allocated into?\n4) should I be creating a separate Roth IRA retirement fund?\n5) I have a separate 401k plan from my previous employment and have never touched it. Should I roll it over to my current employer? What is the negative effect of not rolling over as apposed to rolling it over?\n\nEDIT: I currently make 65k gross a year.",

The Roth component to either is irrelevant for contribution limits. \n\n&gt;2) what happens if I put more than $6,500 in annually?\n\nSee above. \n\n&gt;3) for this fund, am I suppose to just leave it alone or am I suppose to set up where the funds are being allocated into?\n\nDepends what your plan default is. You absolutely want to verify your money is invested and not held in cash. \n\n&gt;4) should I be creating a separate Roth IRA retirement fund? \n\nLimits are global within 401 and IRA designations. Having multiple accounts numbers does not increase contribution limits. \n\n&gt;5) I have a separate 401k plan from my previous employment and have never touched it. Should I roll it over to my current employer? What is the negative effect of not rolling over as apposed to rolling it over?\n\nIf your plan accepts roll-ins, sure. I prefer less accounts to more. Negatives could be higher fees for inactive employees.",

The employer match doesn't count toward that limit, and if your company has a mandatory contribution policy, that amount doesn't count either. Your effective total amount going into your 401k in 2023 can therefore be higher than $22,500.",

With a single employer, you usually can\u2019t overcontribute to a 401k. Payroll will stop you. You can if you have multiple employers within one year. If you over-fund an IRA it becomes expensive in taxes until you fix it. \n\n4. You could have a separate IRA. There are some different consideration for Roth versus traditional IRA. Again, why Roth l?\n\n5. Nothing is inherently wrong with leaving an old 401k alone. It may have higher fees now that your old employer isn\u2019t paying them. If it doesn\u2019t, check the investment choices available through the old and new 401k plans. Assuming neither is definitely superior, combining is a minor convenience but not important.",

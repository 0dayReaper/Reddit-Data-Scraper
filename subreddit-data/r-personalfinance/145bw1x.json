    "postText": "I feel I'm better informed than many people on some things when it comes to investing and retirement but I admit I have big blind spot when it comes to Life Insurance. It has a bad reputation here and elsewhere and since I dont have dependents and assets exceed debts by a significant margin, its not something I've bothered to dig deeper into as its not something I presently need or have purchased for myself.\n\nHowever, I'm currently trying to help my family make sense of my grandmother's assets and make a plan for her remaining years. She'll be 81 years old this year and has several life insurance policies and I'm just not sure what the best thing to do would be.\n\nAs far as I can tell, these policies are all paid in full with no further premiums due so I'm not sure anything needs or even should be done but the statements I have dont make much sense to me.\n\n**Policy 1:**\n\n    Type: Single Premium Whole Life\n    Premium Paid: 38k\n    Face Value: 54k\n    Death Benefit: 56k\n    Current Value: 35k\n    Cash Surrender Value: 38k\n    Notes: Accruing a guaranteed 3% rate but appears to be losing $1000/yr\n    There's $1000/yr in interest/dividend growth\n    There's charges of a $750 admin fee and a $95/month mortality payment\n    Current value is less than surrender value\n    I assume because the policy has to pay out the 38k premium\n    Death benefit is also declining by $1k/yr but is still above surrender value\n\n**Policy 2:**\n\n    Type: Single Premium Whole Life\n    Paid-Up Additional Insurance Value: 3k\n    Paid-Up Additional Insurance Cash Value: 2k\n    Face Value: 47k\n    Death Benefit: 50k\n    Cash Value: 31k\n    Cash surrender Value: 33k\n    Notes: Statements on this account aren't very clear\n    Based on stated Cash value seems to pay a ~0.5% qtrly dividend (2%/annual)\n    Dividend is used to purchase Paid Up additional Insurance.\n\n**Policy 3:**\n\n    Type: Limited Pay Whole Life Insurance\n    Paid Up Additional Insurance Value: 17k\n    Death Benefit: 20k\n    Guranteed Cash Value: 2k\n    Cash Surrender Value: 17k\n    Notes: Even less details here as provider does not have online interface\n    Based on stated Cash value seems pay a ~3.1% annual dividend \n    Dividende is used to purchase Paid Up additional insurance\n\n**Policy 4:**\n\n    Type: Prudential 7-year Surrender Annuity IRA-Plan (Contract Date 2018)\n    Value: 257k\n    Surrender Value: 236k\n    Premium Paid: 250k\n    Paid Out to Date: 52k\n    RMD: 13k\n\n**Policy 5:**\n\n    Type: Reliance Standard Keystone Index 5-year Surrender Annuity (Contract Date 2018)\n    Value: 257k\n    Surrender Value: 245k\n    Premium Paid: 250k\n    Paid Out to Date: 51k\n    RMD: 13k\n    Notes: Reliance account admin website is currently under construction \n    I'm not clear on all the details with this annuity as a result\n    It looks very similar to the Prudential Annuity IRA plan but 5 vs 7yr\n\n**Other Account Info:**\n\nAs it stands she's already sitting on a rather large amount in cash ($240k) and only about 1/2 of it is in HYSA's (working on addressing this by at least moving it to an HYSA but she's stubborn and insists the money stays where it is because she has to pay bills). She also has another IRA with $120k in it and a $6k RMD this year.\n\nStill trying to get a handle on her expenses but between social security and RMDs she's getting about 70k per year not including dividends paid on her individual stock holdings and interest paid on the HYSA and CD accounts she does currently have. I'm conservatively estimating expenses not including taxes to come in somewhere around $50k as she does have a $1500 mortage that she pays $1000 more per month on.\n\nHer mortgage is a 15 year loan refinanced in 2020 at 2.87%. She's already has paid it down so it has 8.5 years left on it if I can get her to stop paying $1000 a month extra on it (which will drop her expenses considerably too), if she continues to pay at the current rate it'll be paid off in 4.25 years. There's considerable equity in the house as it is with the current LTV at 16% so there's no reason she shouldn't hold on to the money in a HYSA, earn more than the mortgage is costing and have that money liquid should she need it but again she's stubborn, doesnt want to change anything and is insistent she pay off the house before she dies. I dont fundamentally have issue with that but in addition to her assets, my family could afford to pay off or continue the mortgage without her so I'd like her to be able to have more money for her enjoyment, more for her long-term care and I'd like her to take the 8.5 years instead of 4.25 years as it gives her something to strive/live for. I told her to stop paying extra and to look at paying off the mortgage as her 89th birthday gift to herself... I think she's coming around as she's agreed to reduce the extra payments but she still wants to pay $500 more per month... Its a work in progress.\n\nAdmittedly we should have had these conversation 5, 10, 15 years ago as we would have had more options to structure things but on the cash front, I'm currently thinking we should have her open a ROTH IRA and make a $7500/yr contribution there and possibly do a Roth conversion on 30-50k of her IRA each year until that account has been emptied (trying to keep her in the same medicare bracket). She's getting to an age where she's going to start getting banged over the head with RMDs so this would allow her to get some of her money back out there, minimize her current RMDs and allow her children (mid-forties and mid-50s) to draw on the accounts as non-taxable income and potentially not have to draw on those accounts until their own retirements assuming she lives another 10-15 years. She should have enough cash on hand to meet current obligations for the next 5 years without RMDs and Social Security income so not being able to touch this money for the next 5-10 years doesnt seem to be a problem. I'm thinking we'll also go ahead and ladder some of her cash on hand into T-Bills and Notes for the next 5 years and move whatever is left into an HYSA...\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyway back to the topic of these insurance policies... I'm not entirely clear on our options here or what all of this really means and I'm also frustrated that her nephew who works in financial services sold her these large annuity policies at 76 years old and didnt advise her to move any money to the post-tax side; I feel like he took advantage to enrich his own wallet on the commissions of selling an annuity to someone who probably didnt need it in the first place given her holdings and age but then maybe that's just a misinterpretation of what I think I know about these policies.\n\nNonetheless, I'm looking for recommendations on what to do now and to get a better understanding of what all these valuations actually mean.\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

            "comment": "So first, to make a Roth IRA contribution, you need to have earned income.  I'm guessing that mom is retired, and SS doesn't count as earned income.  So she may not qualify for a Roth IRA contribution.\n\nFor the life insurance policies: I'm assuming that they are paid up?  i.e. she doesn't need to pay any more to maintain the insurance for the rest of her life?  If so, then just hold on to them.  It sounds like she/the family doesn't need the cash value of the policies.  So whenever she passes, the beneficiaries would get the insurance amounts.  Just check the beneficiary designation.\n\nAnnuities have a bad rap, but wait to pass judgement until you get more information.  Do these annuities have some kind of living benefit rider attached?  The most common is a 'lifetime income rider', which means that mom will always receive a certain monthly amount regardless of the markets.  That can be a compelling income layer on top of her SS and may have provided some peace of mind when she purchased them years ago.  There's simply not enough information to speculate on this.  Perhaps ask the nephew for more information/details.\n\nWhat are her future LTC plans?  Does she have a plan in place should she need help?  Does family plan to help, physically and financially?  I would hold off on the Roth Conversion until you have this conversation.  Maybe there was no plan at all (very common), and her assets may need to be used to pay for those future potential costs.",

                    "comment": "Ok so yeah that's something hadn't realized with her income sources not being classified as earned income so good point there. Obviously my retirement knowledge is more on the retirement planning side not the \"in-retirement.\" I thought I had another 25-30 years or so before I personally had to worry about these conversations or at least another 10 or so until I need to start having them with my own mother... Although this is making me realize I should probably have the conversation with my mother in the w years\n\nAnyway, my grandmother officially retired this year in January after her annual bonus was paid though. I believe her earned income from this should be more than $7500 for this year... Obviously doesn't help in future years and it might just be easier to add it to her current IRA and reduce her taxable income for this year though obviously we have some time yet to decide this.\n\nI feel like the ROTH conversion is somewhat needed here because she's got RMDs coming off the 2 annuities and the IRA and she's got 5+ years of current expenses met in cash on hand and another 2-3 years of expenses if she stops paying extra on the mortgage. Its not much but we can potentially take at least $6k off the money she has to withdraw in the coming years... and if I can get her to move the other half of her cash into something that will actually produce a yield, like an HYSA, it wont even register as a loss of income for her because she'll be throwing off nearly that much per year in interest payments.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe whole life insurance policies do indicate they are paid-in-full and dont require additional payments. The dividends on 2 of the accounts are being used to purchase paid-up additional life insurance. The dividends on the 3rd account are being taken by mortality payments and admin fees but there's no premium being paid. The policy is just \"losing\" value YOY relative to the current value and death benefit though the \"face value\" and \"surrender value\" remain the same.\n\nI do have more information on the annuities. I have statements from the Pacific Life annuity and fact sheet. I also have the brochure from the Reliance Standard Annuity but like the whole life policy statements/documents I have, it might as well be written in Greek for what I can understand from it. \n\nPacific Life Annuity Fact Sheet (7-year)\n\n[https://www.annuities.pacificlife.com/content/dam/paclife/rsd/annuities/public/pdfs/fact-sheets/pacific-index-edge-fact-sheet.pdf](https://www.annuities.pacificlife.com/content/dam/paclife/rsd/annuities/public/pdfs/fact-sheets/pacific-index-edge-fact-sheet.pdf)\n\nThis is the Reliance Standard Keystone Annuity (5-year):  \n[https://www.reliancestandard.com/SiteData/docs/KeystoneNR/e49abfb1657ce840/Keystone-NR.pdf](https://www.reliancestandard.com/SiteData/docs/KeystoneNR/e49abfb1657ce840/Keystone-NR.pdf)  \n\n\nReliance will hit 5 years this year and Pacific Life will hit 7 years in 2025.",

But before paying the taxes on the conversion, have the conversation.  You have time to do the conversion by year's end.\n\nLife Insurance: Don't get hung up on the policies losing value.  They are not designed to keep up with the markets.  They're designed for tax-free life insurance, upon her passing.  \n\nAnnuities: It's hard to comment on these annuities without knowing more about your grandmother's situation and specific investments.  There's so much nuance with this, that a Reddit comment can't address.  The nephew would help explain the rationale for these annuities.",

The benefit of a retirement account is TIME and compounding, at 81, time could be very short.\n\nI would cash out every one of the life insurance policies.\n\nThat will give her $550,000 did math in my head, could be less.\n\nTell her, she does not need to leave any death benefits to anyone, she can leave the stocks she buys to everyone.\n\nWith that money buy five DOW 30 dividend paying stocks, $100,000 into each stock, she keeps the rest in her HYSA.\n\nDOW\n\nMMM\n\nIBM\n\nJPM\n\nWBA\n\nThe $500,000 will pay her about $25,000 in dividends each year, which is 5%.\n\nThe stocks could appreciate in value and be worth more than the life insurance policies, meanwhile, she gets the $25000 per year in added income.",

                    "comment": "I was thinking cashing out or rather partially cashing out and converting policy 5, the 5-year $250k annuity when it reaches maturity later this year\u2026 or maybe leave the annuity alone and focus on her IRA first since that conversion procedure is pretty simple.\n\nThe idea of moving it to a ROTH was just retaining available access to funds and not requiring her to take taxable withdraws or have taxable dividends in the immediate future given she has 2-3 years of living expenses already in cash accounts without any income and SSA + RMDs on her IRA and remaining annuity add up to $50k/yr which will probably be enough for her to live off once I win the argument that she doesnt need to dump $12K extra per year into her 2.87% mortgage that she\u2019s already 4 years ahead on.\n\nShe also already has holdings in several companies like XOM, DOW, COP and several others that she says cant be touched until she passes because she bought them years ago (so long ago that the brokerage holding XOM doesnt even know her cost basis and honestly, she\u2019s got some mild hoarder tendencies and I know the family is dreading having to go through her stuff enough as it is so tracking down her cost basis may not be easy given the number of years and dividend reinvestments so it absolutely makes sense to get the step-up in basis if she doesnt need the principal investment). These are in taxable investment accounts as it is. Im not sure yet how much these are throwing off per year in dividends yet because the dividends are being reinvested and the way she has these holdings each in its own individual account that isnt under a single brokerage umbrella has slowed down access. (I plan to transfer and consolidate them all under one account once I get access to them). The rough estimate is she probably has another $100k or more invested here.\n\nGoing back to opening a ROTH IRA and doing a conversion though, we very well could do something like you suggest within the IRA instead of buying a fund\u2026 which provides the best of both\u2026\n\nIt would eliminate a $13k RMD for her, allow her to redeposit the dividends and let the account to continue growing while she meets current obligations through cash on hand. If she needs the money before 86, it would depend how much she needs access to\u2026 its not like doing a $50k conversion this year and paying 22-24% income tax on it and then withdrawing the $50k next year from her ROTH as a tax-free return of principal damages her any\u2026. And if she needs $150k in 3 years time, well she\u2019ll have already paid tax on $100k at 22-24% and she can withdraw the remaining $50k from the pretax side at 22-24% vs having to withdraw $150k and paying up to 32% on some of her money (not to mention the impact to her medicare premiums)\u2026 there\u2019s just no way I can see to get her into a lower tax bracket; it\u2019ll take ~5 years to get rid of 1 of these IRA annuities in this method, let alone both of them and the $120k she\u2019s got in an IRA account as it is\u2026 so if anything doing these conversions poses no real risk of tax losses.\n\nThe ROTH also helps when she passes for my mom and aunt to have 10 years to withdraw the funds tax free\u2026 granted it helps my mom more than my aunt since mom is 54 and is in the 35% income tax bracket while aunt is 44 and in the 22-24% income tax bracket\u2026 it certainly doesnt hurt my aunt\u2019s position to take the tax hit now under my grandmother\u2019s 22% tax bracket though\u2026 its just not as helpful as it would be for my mom to not have to take taxable RMDs. \n\nThis isnt strictly required though since both mom and aunt could roll-over the inherited IRA to their own IRA\u2019s\u2026 a ROTH though still just seems to make more sense here.",

It\u2019d take 10 years of 4% dividends for the cash-out value to reach current death benefit on those accounts without considering the growth at least 2 of the growth accounts appear to be achieving per year\u2026  granted this doesnt consider growth of the underlying stock which would likely exceed that growth but its still a lot of ground to make up, especially if it increases her taxes and/or medicare premium.",

    "postText": "I want to make sure I'm understanding this correctly. On a regular mortgage payment, some proportion of the money goes to paying principle and another proportion goes to paying interest. On a typical amortization schedule, the first few years of payments are very interest-heavy, and the last few years are very principle-heavy.\n\nIf the borrower makes additional payments to reduce the principle, does it change these proportions on all subsequent payments? That is to say, does paying down principle early make a more of your money go to paying principle on your next regular scheduled payments?",

            "comment": "In somewhat simplified terms:\n\n* When you close on a conventional mortgage, your required monthly Principal+Interest amount is locked in for the life of the loan.  If you pay only that each month, the mortgage is paid off in 360 months.\n   * Note: the \"escrow\" portion of your payment is to cover costs outside the mortgage itself, and that dollar amount can (and usually will) change over the years as property taxes / insurance premiums change.\n* Each month, your incurred interest is calculated from your current owed balance and 1/12th the annual rate of the loan.  So if your May balance was $175k at a 4% rate, your interest owed for your June payment is $175,000 \\* 4% / 12 = $583.  \n* The newly incurred interest is effectively paid \"first\" out of that fixed amount, with the rest reducing the owed balance used in the following month.\n* If you make a one-time extra payment, that will reduce your balance owed, which will cause all future interest charges to diverge from the original amortization schedule. \n\nSo yes, making an extra payment reduces your overall owed balance, which reduces the interest calculated each month, making future payments need less to cover that interest and paying the balance down slightly faster.  This will reduce your total interest cost over the life of the loan and pays it off sooner.",

            "comment": "Paying down principal also reduces interest because there\u2019s less principal to calculate interest off of. Also look into bi-weekly payments instead of monthly - you\u2019ll get 26 payments a year, which effectively gives you an extra month of payments annually to pay off your loan early. HTH",

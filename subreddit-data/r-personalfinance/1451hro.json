    "postText": "This took place in Florida, the private insurance company is Advent Health administered by Health First and later switched (due to bouyout i believe) to Oscar Health.\n\nWhen the wife and I decided to try for a kid, I switched from my company health insurance (name left out because they arent involved in the issue at all) to a private plan through healthcare.gov. The monthly was a bit higher, but all the procedure prices were so low it worked out better financially. \n\nNever had any issues with the private company while we had them. The pre-conception issues we had were handled smoothly, post-conception scans/appointments were all billed to what the plan documentation said as well as what the OBGYN office went over with us at our financial planning meeting either them after they went through our plan. Birth went great (February 28, 2022), as did after care in the hospital and with the OB later.\n\nJump to May of 23. We moved states (to NY) in Nov of 22. Old insurance isn't up here, and the family is now with my new works health plan. We get a bill from the OB in Florida that says we owe $100 for a scan that was performed February 3, 2022. This wasn't a scheduled scan during the pregnancy, but we had 3 scans before this that weren't scheduled, we paid the $50 copay for those, and those aren't changed. It says on the bill that we paid our 50 dollar copay that day, so we didn't miss a payment or anything. Scans that were scheduled during the pregnancy (anatomy scan, routine check in scans) were $0 copay, so I know this wasn't a scheduled scan, but it was coded the same as the other 3 unscheduled scans.\n\nCall the OB office and speak to billing, the lady says the insurance provider decided they billed the OB wrong for this procedure, and changed the bill. According to her, they can do this in one of two ways. They can change the bill saying that the amount changed is needed to be paid by the doctors office, or that the amount changed is needed to be paid by the patient. \n\nThis just seems odd to me. I'm not super versed on any type of health insurance, as my parents were military, I was military, and I'm now fully covered by the VA. My wife is from the UK, so she isn't schooled in health insurance either. Is this something I should or need to pay? Where can I go to find my legal obligation in this?\n\nAnd, as a side note out of curiosity, if this is legal for the insurance company/OB to do, what's the limit on it? If you get a surgery done, pay the bill...can they just come back 10 years later and say \"ah sorry mate, you owe us a mil\"?\n\nThanks in advance for any help or advice you kind redditors can offer me!\n\nEdit: clarified the insurance names in the first paragraph.",

    "postText": "I am new to 401k, so I'd appreciate any insights from people who know more about this. My salary is 102k, company is matching up to 6% (100% of the first 4% and 50% of the next 2%). What I'd like to know is:  \n1. Is it wise to max out the employee contribution (22,500 USD for 2023)? If yes, do you simply calculate the % you should contribute off of your gross salary (i.e. 22% x 102K = 22,500 so I should contribute 22%)?\n\n2. Are there any strategies/ rules of thumb in deciding which plans to invest in?\n\n3. Is there anything else I should be considering when enrolling?\n\nTIA!",

I would not max out your 401k match at this stage unless you're swimming in money and have more money than you know what to do with. BUT at the least, contribute at least the first 6% to get the match.\n2. Keep it simple. Low cost index funds and maybe add in a target date fund or two.\n\n401k up to match &gt; HSA &gt; Roth IRA &gt; more 401k/brokerage. In that order.",

First thing you want to do is get your full employer match; the rest depends on your personal financial situation and how much you want to save for retirement vs spend on other things in the near term. \n2. Generally you want a low-cost total market index fund or target date fund. The wiki has good resources.\n3. Check costs for the plan and the funds you're investing in. Some 401k offerings have very high expense ratios or other fees; generally, for an index fund (it'll say \"index\" in the name) you want an expense ratio on the order of 0.2% or less. If your 401k offerings are all 1% or more, then your employer is likely violating the law by failing to offer reasonably priced options.",

It wasn\u2019t all that long ago (~20 years) when anything less than 2% was considered cheap.  Load funds were also common.  While I agree that 1% is expensive by today\u2019s standards, there\u2019s nothing close to illegal about it.",

There will be many more years to come. \n\nSecond, some companies have a maximum contribution percentage of your salary. Say you find out that you want to invest 40%, maybe the company allows a maximum of 30% per paycheck and you can't do it. I would ask about this at your workplace. \n\nThird, like others have said I would also make sure to have enough income to cover expenses, to pay off debt and to build up an emergency fund if you haven't got one already. Maxing out your retirement accounts is pretty awesome, but being financially secure now should have even more priority.",

The more you can contribute (up to the max) the better.  Anything less than the amount to get the full match (6% in this case) is just dumb.",

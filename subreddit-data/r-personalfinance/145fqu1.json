    "postText": "I (24M) am wondering how I should plan my finances in the short and long term.\n\nAfter my normal expenses, I project to have around $875 every month to either invest or payoff debt.\n\nAs of today, I am assuming that Federal student loans will resume in August. I have no other debt.\n\nLoan #1 is currently at $3,396.48 with a 4.53% interest rate. $24 minimum payment.\n\nLoan #2 is currently at $6,603.52 with a 2.75% interest rate. $36 minimum payment.\n\nMy Emergency Fund is currently at $3,661.69 in Ally Saving at 3.92%.\n\nMy goal is to get my emergency fund to around $11k-$12k.\n\nI also have an Vanguard Roth IRA with a couple hundred in it.\n\nMy question is should I prioritize paying down my (low interest debt) or building up my emergency fund and investing.\n\nOf my extra ~$900, how much should go to building up my emergency fund to its $11k-$12k goal and how much should go to paying off my student loan debt? If I prioritize my EF, after its fully funded, should I continue to invest and take advantage of time/compound interest? Should I fully focus on one and not the other or how should I balance it out?\n\nThank you in advance!",

Since you don't have payments in June / July : all your money goes to build up your fund.\n\nFrom August : Since your interest rates are fairly low : Pay the minimum amounts towards your student loans; the remainder into emergency fund.\n\nWhen you have reached your target for emergency fund : Look at your goals. Financially speaking : earning a higher rate on investing is better than paying down low cost debt; however some people may have goals around being debt free, or needing to remove debt to take on a mortgage etc. You also need to build up retirement savings.\n\nUse the flowchart from the Wiki ----&gt; How to handle $",

What is your job, will you be eligible for public servant forgiveness?\n\nBuild up your emergency funds, we are at time of economic uncertainty, cash reserve is going to be valuable, since its parked at a high yield account,  you are still getting a decent return, though I would suggest put them in Ally's no penalty CD for even greater return (4.25 now) \n\nWhat is your plan for investment? are you planning on putting more in your roth IRA account?  Do you have pension or 401K match?",

Some would rather pay off debt ASAP, but its really up to you.\n\nTake advance of the 401K,  you get free money from the company match and avoid losing your earning to IRS. building up your emergency, no job is guaranteed nowadays, you want to be in good financial footing.  Then put at least 5% into your roth IRA.",

            "comment": "Well there are several different ways you can do it and I don't think any is wrong or right as long as in the end you pay off the debt, build the emergency fund, and invest for the long term and stick to it. As long as you can follow through I don't think there is a wrong way.\n\nIn the past I have done the math to answer similar questions myself. Using long term average market returns I found that no matter the scenario as long as the debt had a lower interest rate then the market returns, making minimum payments to debt and putting everything else into investments always yielded the highest end balance even after subtracting interest paid from investment returns.\n\nBut paying off the debt first can be an emotional relief too. Which causes a lot of people to justify doing that first. In the end I think very few people will ever regret paying off debts and becoming debt free. If this is the path you want to take I would allocate all the money to the one with the highest interest first while making min payments on the others. \n\nMe personally I would make minimum payments to the debt and put everything else into building the emergency fund. I personally have been saved by my own emergency fund and I think having cash allocated to emergencies is critical. Once you build it to your goal I would continue to make minimum payments to debt and put everything else into investing.",

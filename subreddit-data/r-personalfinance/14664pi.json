    "postText": "back in april i had a pretty big scare with my main (and only) bank account. someone somehow managed to steal 4,000$ in my bank account and then still managed to overdraft my checking account by 2,000$. \n\ni locked all my cards, filed a claim and ended up getting the money back (thank god). i opened another account at another bank that's said to be better for banking.\n\nive been wanting to completely close out this account even though they sent me knew cards as i also have a credit card linked to it. with this new bank i wouldn't be able to get a credit card just yet but it makes me anxious having it. my parents recommend i keep the account open and just put one hundred in it, but what do you guys recommend? should i leave the accounts open? or would it be better to close it?",

This isn't like credit cards generally you won't want to close lines so you can have a long credit age and closing one might just sink it a bit.",

If you do however go into the red and decide not to pay it back, you'll be labeled and black balled from opening another bank. You would have to pay that off before thinking about opening up a bank account.\n\nCredit cards if you have one credit card for three years and you took out a second one later on with maybe a year on that. Your average credit is 2 years. It's the average of all your credit cards. That's why it's not recommended to close credit lines. Unless the fee or apr makes absolute no sense but even then you don't have to use it. You could buy a piece of candy once a month with it and have it automatically deducted from your checking account",

If you mean you've been using the old bank account to pay your credit card or have it linked in some way, you need to get it unlinked either online or by calling your old bank.\n\nKeep the credit card open, though, if your credit card number hasn't been compromised. Just because you're moving to a new bank doesn't mean you have to get a new credit card. They are two different things, not connected in any way.\n\nFor the new bank, just make sure you're able to get a secure checking/savings account that won't charge you a bunch of fees or overdraft payments.",

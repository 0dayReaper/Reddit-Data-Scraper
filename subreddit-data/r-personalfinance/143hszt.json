    "postText": "Looking for high level feedback on my situation. I live on a hill inside a gated community that has HOA. During winter, icy conditions caused my car to crash into the gate severely damaging it. Gate was 8 years old, HOA got it replaced with a brand new one for $23k. My car insurance only wants to pay $20k per their policy since they do not owe depreciation. HOA wants to come after me for the 3K difference and car insurance won't sign off on $20k payment unless I agree to pay $3k.\n\nWhat are my options here other than paying the $3k out of pocket? Both the car insurance and I are on the same page regarding us not having to pay the full amount for a brand new gate with warranty when it replaced an 8 year old gate that cost significantly less and had depreciated in value.\n\n**Edit1** (adding email discussion with insurance agent): Normally we would make an offer and get a signed release from the owner of the gate releasing us and you from any more payments. The HOA refused to to sign that as they wanted to collect depreciation from you.  The team leader had said that if we got proof they were charging you and you were paying that then we could amend the release only so they would sign it for the payment of the $20k.\n\n**Edit2** (second email with insurance agent when I asked if there were any previous agreements with HOA): Here is the estimate they provided for 23k and then my estimate trying to match their materials amount and taking depreciation of 8 years on the gate and opener.  I had called and made that offer for 20k and they wouldn\u2019t sign a release.\n\n**Edit3**: Since HOA denied to sign the release of 20k with insurance, they have charged me the full 23k on my HOA account. Thankfully, I'm not enrolled in auto-draft.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few fun updates for weekend reading:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Update 1**(asked my insurance agent if they could pay the depreciation to avoid litigation and here's the response): I had already reviewed and there wouldn\u2019t be any litigation on our end as the state of Washington recognizes depreciation and betterment in third party claims. Its just not an amount we or you would owe them in a loss like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Update 2**(responses from HOA to my questions):\n\nWhere in the HOA bylaws or CCRs does it state that damages to the common area can be charged to the resident without getting HOA's insurance involved?It does not say that,  CC&amp;R\u2019s are attached.  I did not file a claim in December since you had reached out and said that you have insurance.  When the HOA policy is in effect the HOA insurance covers the loss and the owner is responsible for repayment of the HOA insurance deductible up to $10,000.\n\nIs there a clause saying that the resident is responsible for paying the replacement and not the actual cash value for damage?This is not specified.  The replacement cost is $23,000 and I believe that your auto-insurance wanted to cover $20,000.\n\nAlso, who is responsible for maintaining the roads inside of the community under various conditions?The roads are privately owned by the HOA as common area.  The HOA had ice and snow removal contracted before this event and we were scheduled to be serviced.  The road conditions were so poor that the vendor couldn't make it to the property to complete the work.",

Insurance would most likely pay for the value of the old gate or an assessment on what a new gate would cost.\n\nIf it was a 20 year old car you hit the other driver doesn\u2019t just get to purchase a new sports car and bill you for it.\n\nHowever whether you are on the hook for the difference is another matter depending on the HOA rules/bylaws. You\u2019ll need to look into those and might need to get your own lawyer.",

For one thing, it depends on whether the damaged property is *real* property (which means any piece of land and anything built on and affixed to it) or \u201cpersonal\u201d property (which includes any property that isn\u2019t real property). I believe that an entrance gate would be classified as real property. \n\nIn most US states, the measure of (monetary) damages for (physical) damage to *real* property is the usually the cost to restore the property to the same condition that it was in before the damage occurred. \n\nSo, depending on where OP is, the HOA may be entitled to the cost of repairing the gate, or the cost of replacing it if can\u2019t be repaired. \n\nDamages for damage to personal property are often calculated as the cost of repair, or the property\u2019s fair market value (FMV), whichever is cheaper. But even if the gate is personal property (which seems unlikely), the insurer probably is still wrong. it looks like the insurer is calculating the HOA\u2019s loss as the amount that it originally cost to build the gate minus some amount for \u201cdepreciation.\u201d That might make sense for something like a car, because there\u2019s market for used cars. But I\u2019m pretty sure there\u2019s no market for used gates, as gates are custom designed for specific locations on specific properties. A used gate cannot have a market value (let alone a FMV) if it doesn\u2019t have a market.",

The analogy about a car does not make sense since you can\u2019t just go out and buy a depreciated gate to replace it.  The only way to make them whole is to pay the total repair cost.   Your insurance company can argue that they paid most than customary/reasonable and challenge the amount but they will likely lose.  You shouldn\u2019t be paying anything unless the amount exceeds the amount of your insurance coverage in which case then you should or the HOA can sue you to recover the remainder.",

In this simplified example, let\u2019s assume that at 20 years, HOA will 100% need to build a new gate. Let\u2019s say OP crashes and breaks the gate 19 years into the lifespan of the gate. If there was no depreciation, then you would argue OP should be on the hook for paying for a new gate that will last another 20 years. That would mean the HOA would be benefiting from not buying a new gate for an extra 19 years only because OP crashed into the gate. \n\nInstead, it is more fair for OP to pay one year of the gates lifetime or approximating 1/20th of the cost of the gate because the gate depreciated (assuming linear depreciation). It should be expected that the HOA has been saving up for a new gate over the last 19 years that the original gate depreciated and should have the funds to pay the remainder of the cost. \n\nI hope this helps!",

Your HO policy is a contract between you and your carrier. They have to do what\u2019s agreed in the contract. A liability claim doesn\u2019t follow any contractual agreement, it\u2019s simply an out of court settlement. Insurance doesn\u2019t have to offer a dime, but they may be held in bad faith towards their insured if there\u2019s a solid legal exposure. \n\n2. HO policies include language to specify replacement cost vs. value for different kinds of losses. And not all policies are the same. For example, things like roofs, furnaces, etc. that routinely need to be replaced are *typically* covered at actual cash value. So if your 20 year roof gets blown off at 15 years, you\u2019re most likely getting 25% the cost of a new one. \n\n3. The structure itself is seen as one asset, so a repair to the structure isn\u2019t broken down to each individual part that might go into it. \n\n4. Frankly, sometimes the cost of materials for repairs does come into play. You\u2019re correct that an adjuster isn\u2019t going to risk a lawsuit on the basis of putty and nails, but \u201cbetterment\u201d is often applied for larger components. Like if old worn tires are destroyed in a collision they\u2019ll be appraised as such, and if new ones are put on, the difference will be charged to the claimant.",

This question is far more legal focused than it is personal finance. There's a fair amount of overlap, but it's clear that very few people here have litigated liability and insurance claims. I own a business, so I've been through this a few times.\n\nYour liability is not capped at what your insurance will pay. When you pay for insurance, you are paying them to mitigate your liability. Any party who is harmed by your actions has not agreed to the terms in your insurance agreement.\n\nLiability and financial responsibility is determined by law, no your insurance policy. Your insurance is there to pay whatever they're obligated to, but if a plaintiff were to receive an award for damages in excess of your insured amount, you are absolutely on the hook for it.\n\nFor example, let's say your liability insurance were capped at $100k, but you did $200k in damage to some public infrastructure. Like you drove into a supporting column for a bridge or something. You're on the hook for the difference. Your liability does not terminate at the limit of your policy.\n\nIn disputes with unrelated third parties, the negotiation will normally weigh heavily upon the defendants ability to pay. If the defendant is broke, it wouldn't be worth the plaintiff's time to sue them.\n\nHowever, you are not dealing with an unrelated third party. HOA CCRs normally provide the ability to levy liens against your property. So you've got a situation here where the counterparty has an avenue to hang this cost around your neck whether you want to pay it or not.\n\nI am **not saying** you should just cave though. I'm saying that you're not going to get a proper answer here on Reddit, because no one has read your CCRs. The parent poster in this thread is saying the HOA can't simply tack this on as a lien because it's not dues. What they have failed to consider is that many CCRs contain provisions about damage to common areas by residents.\n\nWhat you need to do is call a couple of local attorneys and sit down for a consult. Look for attorneys that specifically deal in real estate or HOAs. The consult is usually free, and they'll be able to at least give you some guidance. Depending upon what's in the CCRs or your state's laws (which also vary), it may be worth a couple hundred bucks to have the attorney draft a letter to your HOA explaining why they should drop it. Then again, the attorney might tell you that it's not worth fighting it for $3k and you should just pay. One thing is for sure, an attorney who knows the specifics is going to give far more sound advice than anyone in this thread.",

It would take a lot of time and work to try and find a used replacement and they provide a gated area so need to repair it in a timely manner.   So I am not sure a case for unjust enrichment would get far.  They would not have wanted or needed a new gate if not for the damage to the installed one.  They just do not want to pay for a new gate they would not have needed otherwise.      So where is the breach of contract or illegal financial practices?",

They will be responsible for defending you and it will likely cost them 3k to do it, even if they win.\n\nThey probably won't budge though, I think I'd keep referring the HOA back to the insurance company, and let the HOA know you agree this is all you owe and if they want to take legal action the insurance company is prepared to defend it.  It'll cost them just as much.\n\nEdit:  it's weird that car insurance won't sign off on the 20k, unless you pay the 3k.  Only thing I can think of is HOA won't sign a release until that is resolved.  A release on a minor PD claim like this, probably means the HOA is being really difficult to work with.",

Insurance agent said that if they they got proof showing HOA is charging me the depreciation, and that I confirm I would pay, then they could amend the release and pay the $20k.  \nLast time I spoke to HOA, they said how their relationship is directly with the owner(me) and that it is the owner's responsibility to make and arrange all the payments. HOA dues currently show that I owe 23k.",

From your other comments, it sounds to me like the HOA has made some questionable moves, like charging the amount to your HOA dues account (it's obviously not dues, and who knows if the rules let them do that?), failing to salt the road as weather conditions required, refusing to work with your insurance company, maybe other things... e.g. how many quotes did they get to replace the gate? Did they get quotes to repair the gate vs. replacing? If they are expecting someone else to pay for the damage, they may not have the right to unilaterally decide on repair vs. replace and on a price and vendor, though it sounds like that might be what they did.\n\nIf it was me, I would at least talk to an attorney to decide how much of a fight it's worth putting up, and more importantly to protect myself.",

While the old one had depriciated the hoa would not have had to replace it if it had not gotten damaged.   It would cost time and labor and probably transportation costs to try and find a suitable used gate if one even can be found.  So I can understand the hoa having to get a gate back in place quickly and not being able to deal with all that (which could cost more than 3k anyway).  It really does not seem like they padded the bill with an outrageous upgrade or anything.  I can see them wanting to be made whole.    If it went to court would the insurance be paying for a lawyer for you?   Maybe remind them of that if they would and see if they will just pay the 3k to get it over and done with.\n\nEdit:  I have thought about this some more.  Neither the hoa nor the insurance company has any incentive to initiate a suit.    You would have to do that and I am not sure the insurance company would support that,  since you are not defending.   With the hoa being able to put a lein on your house they have no need to sue which is what would bring the insurance back to the table.     Talk to a lawyer if you want,  but for a 3k difference I have my doubts you would win a claim for unjust enrichment.    Probably going to wind up paying.  Just be careful you don't wait and somehow lose the offer from insurance to pay the 20k.  I saw in my insurance if I initiate a suit they no longer need to pay out.",

You could also ask the HOA directly. Ask them to point out the section of the rules that allows them to directly charge you for damage. Don't make any other claims or arguments. Simply ask for justification of the charge. Start there.\n\nAlso, the management company does not hold the power. They answer to the board. If the board members have a different opinion, then it's their place to tell the management company to back off.\n\nKeep paying your monthly dues, and be sure to write on the check that it is ONLY for dues. Because what they'll try to do next is claim that your dues payment goes towards the balance and that you are now not paying dues. Then come late fees, which they will try to compound.\n\nInsurance is supposed to pay replacement value. Someone else pointed out that insurance wouldn't pay out for a brand new car if you totaled a 20 year old one, which is true. But if the replacement value of that car is $20k, that's what insurance has to pay out. Same goes with the gate. Since it's unlikely the HOA will find a used gate to replace it with, they sort of have to put in a new one. Insurance should pay for the new one, unless the price is far above actual replacement value. If they find 3 companies that will charge $20k, and the company they chose wants $23k, then the HOA didn't do their homework and this is their fault.",

Your HOA is only owed $20k in court, which is why that\u2019s all your insurance is offering. \n\nOption 1: It sounds like they want to bill you on the HOA portal. I\u2019m not a lawyer, but you may need to sue them for doing so, just so they counter-sue you for the damages. Once they counter-sue, your insurance will retain an attorney to defend you against the suit and the courts will get it sorted out. Don\u2019t pay anything OOP. You\u2019re not legally obligated to pay for their depreciation. \n\nOption 2: You may have the right as a resident to file a claim under the association master policy. File a claim for the common area (fence). They may even pay the depreciation if they have replacement cost on the policy. The HOA insurance adjuster will then handle things with your adjuster. HOA gets paid in full and your insurance only owes the depreciated amount in subrogation.\n\nEdit: Adding that OP should contact an attorney to discuss what happens if this is not resolved by the statute of limitations. The HOA may forget to file suit to protect the statute of limitations so OP would be clear on the liability. Not sure which state this is in. OP should also check if their HOA bylaws somehow supersede the statute of limitations.",

So, should your neighbors be on the hook for 3k for an accident that you caused? \n\nAnd the main question you ask yourself. Hypothetically you own your own gate, and are not part of an HOA. Your neighbor destroyed it. They shrug their shoulders and say our insurance company will only give you 20k for your new gate that you can't buy for 20k. You would expect your neighbor to pay the difference. \n\nEither get the insurance company to pay for it explaining to them that a gate is not a car that they can pick up from a car lot, or dig into your pocket. As someone else said, the HOA doesn't have an agreement with your insurance company. Just my opinion though....",

The insurance company would sure like you to think it\u2019s excluded for third party claims though. \n\nThe insurance company also makes it very difficult for anyone to claim for diminished value because it is usually subjective and is open to opinion so they try to fight it and wait you out. \n\nI would contact the insurance company and advise they are acting in bad faith by rejecting a potentially valid claim, or but not negotiating a claim in an effort to protect their insured (you). \n\nWhat might happen is your insurance company will say the HOA has not presented a claim, or isn\u2019t providing documentation to support their claim. \n\nIf the HOA did not present a claim to the insurance, then they have to. I\u2019d the HOA sues you, then the insurance not only has to step in but they must handle and pay for your defense and provide an attorney. \n\nIf the HOA did not provide supporting documentation then tell them they have to provide it to your insurance company (and make them give you a copy while they\u2019re at it). Usually when you hit this point in the life of the claim what ends up happening is the HOA doesn\u2019t want to deal with the insurance company or interprets their request for supporting documents as a denial. The HOA then comes to you and tries to bypass the insurance. If this happens then you ask them to support their claim. If they do, then pass it to the insurance. If they don\u2019t, then they have no basis to make a demand yet (because they haven\u2019t supported their claim). If they get a annoyed and want to file a lawsuit, then revert back to my above paragraph about the insurance being required to defend you. \n\nIf the insurance company doesn\u2019t want to help, or denies the claim, or ignores you, or even if the HOA bypasses the insurance and tries to fight it your with you directly or files a suit against you\u2026go to your states department of insurance website and FILE A STATE COMPLAINT. Your insurance will wake up and a lot of sets of eyes will be looking at that claim now. \n\nSource: I handle property damage lawsuits for GEICO. Also GEICO is a shit company.",

It cannot be a fine either without board meeting and a hearing, of which you must be notified in writing, have a chance to appear in front of the board etc.\n\n(I'm speaking in terms that are present in the D-S act in CA, I'm not sure if your state has anything like that).\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few years ago we used to lived in a HOA controlled condo. Their \"rules\" had a bunch of stuff such as \"immediate fine for parking in a guest spot, or for moving furniture through the lobby\", and even \"fines for keeping non-wheeled items in a parking stall\". They tried to fine me for keeping a wreath INSIDE of a shopping cart, and gave up after I took photo evidence of basically half the tenants keeping truly unmovable stuff in their stalls.\n\nAnother time I got fined for moving a mattress through the lobby.  In the end we decided to split the fine 50/50 with my landlord to get the HOA of their back because it wasn't worth the fight.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs for you, I more than agree it's between HOA and your insurance - which you should make very clear to the HOA, or their designated lawyer (that might be better if they have one).\n\nThere's probably nothing stopping them for filing a separate civil lawsuit against you for the difference in price, but if HOA has any lawyer they might talk them out of it since the cost to even start the process will exceed the difference.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nCheers",

I wouldn't even be surprised if the company that replaced the gate was friendly with the person making that decision.\n\nAs with anything regarding insurance, its probably going to get worse before it gets better. I absolutely wouldn't pay for anything, get your insurance more involved, and if you can, talking face to face with the person may help. \n\nOn a side note, it always amazes me how easily insurance companies can get out of the line of fire for any bill. Once you have insurance it should be their legal responsibility to resolve the matter without bothering you. The whole idea that insurance can just say no and any amount of money automatically transfers down to the person paying for insurance is so backwards.",

For X premium we agree that we will cover you to X amount. A contractor \u201cyour policy\u201d decides how that works. Insurance companies get to decide how to settle claims within the policy limits. Something that most people don\u2019t understand is no insurance company owes any third party anything until they sue and win. Now this rarely happens 99% of insurers have conceded that it\u2019s easier to handle claims on merit instead of clogging up the court system. \n\nAdditionally third party damages are only owed ACV not RCV this has gone through the courts in many states and held up",

    "postText": "I keep seeing posts where people are struggling with their budget but have some ridiculous car payment. Let's have a little discussion for people who are looking to buy a car. Here's some advice I'll give. Your mileage may vary (oh yes I went there). This advice is in USD but works anywhere. \n\nDon't get stuck holding the bag on a car that depreciates faster than you pay it off. I've done the math at a bunch of different interest rates, and the bottom line is that 48 months is the magic number for loan terms. At 4 years or below, you're typically safe. Maybe you can push the boundary at super low interest rates, but there are other reasons not to finance for too long, including risk of financing a used vehicle for longer than expected reliable service life. \n\nNext, write out your full budget and see what you have room for. Here's where young folks get trapped: maybe if you're still in school or fresh out of school and have super low living expenses, it will appear like you have tons of room for a fancy car. As soon as you become fully independent with a real place to live and food needs and all that jazz (which will very likely happen within a few years), that magic car budget will vanish before your eyes. Be realistic. Account for all the standard living expenses, fun budget, savings, and then be honest - what do you really have to spend on transportation each month? For a lot of people, it'll probably be a few hundred bucks. Then, subtract what insurance and gas and other associated fees will cost you, and multiply what you're left with by 48. That's what you can afford to finance (including interest!) \n\nDoes the number come out well under $10,000 (or equivalent low amount for whatever country you're from)? For many people, it probably does. Don't be discouraged, for you can get a great reliable car under ten grand. \n\nDoes the number come out to less than $5000? Very common! Save up and buy a car in cash.\n\nI feel like people tend to look at $20K as cheap for a car, but it's not cheap at all. Include taxes and fees, finance over 5 years at 5% and you're looking at well over $400/mo. Then tack on insurance (easily $200 for a young driver), and then tack on gas. That $20K car costs you $500-700 per month! If you aren't bringing home $5K+ each month, that probably doesn't fit in your budget. The reality is, even a $20K car is not realistically affordable for the majority of income earners. \n\nWhat about $30K+ cars? Radio commercials make them sound so affordable, but cars in the $30K-$40K range should be seen as luxury vehicles. We're talking six figure income required. Yet, so many people buy $30K SUVs and get screwed by the monthly payments. Please don't let it happen to you. \n\nI work in a respectable profession and make a fairly decent wage. People always ask me why I drive a 10 year old car. It's because that's what I can realistically afford! Society in general has inflated expectations on what they can afford. It's time to fix this and save people from ruining their budgets.\n\nEdit: Thank you to the user who gave me gold! I appreciate it ",

            "comment": "I'd also like to add call and get insurance quotes on the car you want to buy prior to buying it so your not in shock at the cost after you already bought the car and you can budget how much you can realistically spend on the car after insurance cost. It's amazing how much of a difference insurance can cost on a 2 door sports car versus a 4 door sedan. Even if the 2 different cars are worth the same price. And make sure to get gap insurance if you don't put much down but get it through your car insurance not the dealership it's usually cheaper that way.",

It can be a single bit of plastic, but that single bit of plastic can alter who is more likely to buy it and thus the odds of a claim.\n\nA lot more differences between my FZ6 and an R6, but there's still a ton in common between them.  Insurance on the R6 though was about 10x higher than the FZ6. ",

That is really only slower on paper than a new one. Then insure it as a 20 year old and you find out you can only afford liability at most. That's how I got into sport touring bikes. My fjr is as fast as anyone needs, and insures like a touring bike.",

That means very different things to different people.\n\nBut generally it means having enough that you're not downing in debt and seriously stressed about money.  Having nice things doesn't help you if you are too stressed to enjoy them.\n\nBut having lots of money in the bank doesn't help if you are miserable because your car only starts half the time, the shocks are shot, and driving to work gives you horrible back pain because your car sucks.\n\nMaybe you don't care about food, eating rice and chicken and beans every day doesn't make you any less happy than eating fancy all the time.  That's fine, save your money for something else that makes you happy.\n\nI've done the game where the only car we had was broken, and I had a hell of a time getting a ride to go get parts to try and fix it, because I couldn't afford a cab _and_ the parts.  I never, ever want to do that again.  Not doing that again is worth a _lot_ to me.  I don't _care_ about depreciation on a new car, I care that I have a car that isn't going to break down by the side of the road and strand me.\n\nSomeone else might be alright with a car that they have to baby and maintain carefully, they might be fine with having to occasionally call a tow truck.  Other stuff makes them happy, and reduces stress, and that's where they should put their money.\n\nThe same logic applies to pretty much everything else, does having the thing _actually_ make you happier than having the money?  Not _buying_ the thing, but having and using it.\n\n(If buying things is your therapy, you might want to look into actual therapy, it's probably cheaper, and probably better for your mental health in the long run.  But there's nothing wrong with loving window shopping.)",

The reality is, even a $20K car is not realistically affordable for the majority of income earners.\n\n$5k+ each month? You must live in an expensive area...\n\n$900 for rent, $150 for utilities, $50 for phone, $50 for internet, $500 for food (way overspending for many). That's $1650. If you want to splurge and get a really nice, brand new car that has 0 miles and will last 10+ years easily you can definitely afford it with way less than $5k+ monthly salary. You just have to remember that what you overpay in car will lead to less savings and that is a choice, not something that is ruining budget.\n\nThis post is less of a \"can you really afford that car\" and more of a \"shame on you for not saving money when you can get a cheap car\"",

There are so many erroneous opinions that people seem to hold regarding cars (I am speaking primarily of people that are not struggling with basic transportation expenses, but rather those people with good jobs and poor vehicle purchasing habits):\n\n1) A car becomes unreliable above XXX mileage (some say 100k, 150k, or 200k, etc).\n\n2) I only buy news cars. I can't \"afford\" to have to deal with unexpected repairs (this one is almost funny with regards to the way people use or misuse the word \"afford\").\n\n3) I work hard and deserve to treat myself once in a while (makes sense for small rewards, but not with a massive car payment that takes over your finances).\n\n4) All of my coworkers and friends seem to buy newer cars, so that's just what people like me should do (this is a big one, because it seems that adults with middle class and higher incomes are not willing to buck the trend and drive a reliable older car).",

Better gas mileage and three hundred extra bucks in my account every month. \n\nIn contrast, young injineer at work just bought a 50k car on a 70k salary.

Most common sales tactic. \n \nHardest thing to do in car sales is generate a buyer. Sure, you'll get people coming in on their own to buy a new(er) car, but the real money is in being able to generate your own leads from an \"unmotivated\" buyer. So they'll call all the people who bought base model cars 2 years ago. Tell them they'll buy that now old car over market value and sell you a brand new one with better features. \n \nSo they'll give you $1000 over KBB on the old car, but not negotiate on the new car price, roll the loans together, extend the payment, add $20 extra per month (hey, you were doing just fine paying the old amount, what's $20 more for newer, better equipment), and send you on your way. This new car is what you really wanted 2 years ago when you settled for the base model. \n \nNow you're the pride of the parking lot with your brand new car with all the new electronics and sensors. But you're not thinking about the fact that you paid over market for the new car. And you lost any equity you might have built up. \n \nI get fliers from a dealer about my car even (they don't bother calling me). It's worth under a grand and has 170k. Yet I still get a quarterly \"your 2004 c240 is in demand, we'll buy it back above market guaranteed\" note: purchase or lease of new vehicle required. Nobody wants that POS. They just want to make a sale. \n \nBut someone who settled on a used base model car 2 years ago might be persuaded to upgrade ",

Cheap oil is very cheap on Amazon or at Home Depot.  Tools are expensive, but pay for themselves quickly.\n\nYouTube is a great place to learn how to do the work.\n\nHere's an example.  My alternator recently died.  I drive an OK European car, about 11 years old.  Replacement cost per repairpal.com is $579-775.  Dealer was asking closer to $900, Pep Boys asked around $600.\n\nI took the thing out myself and brought it to a local alternator repair shop who rebuilt it for $200.  Took a couple hours of work altogether.\n\nSaved myself $400 in one shot.  That would have paid for ALL my tools and I would have still come out ahead.\n\nPlus you have oil changes and all the routine maintenance that goes into keeping these things operational.  I understand few of us have the time, but this is such a cost saver that it is worth the bother and time to figure it out.\n\nI still take it to a local mechanic family friend for some things like shocks and springs that I'm just not comfortable doing.",

They don't know how they work or what can go wrong with them, and when something goes wrong, they wait way too long and pay way too much money to get them fixed. Once you start working on your own car, you *learn* about it, and when the engine light comes on or it makes a funny noise, you know you can safely ignore it for a while because you know it's something simple that won't hurt it, or you need to get it fixed _stat_ because it could blow up at any time.\n\nAlso, here's a tip. Tools are expensive, but they don't have to be. If you have friends or family nearby, they'll probably lend them to you, or even give you a hand to fix your car. I have a lot of siblings, and rather than us buying all our own tools, we all chip in and buy tools for dad's shop. Whenever we need to work on a car, there's a nicely outfitted shop with a vehicle hoist and all the help you could need. Collectively, we have eight or nine cars that are all more than ten years old and which have all benefitted from this. Of course, not everybody has eight siblings + parents to share tools with, but you get my point.",

The money I've been in the hook for has never felt worth it. And no one has ever complemented my car choice.\n\nEdit: it's a 2013 Chrysler 200.

I think there is a somewhat sliding scale on this (factoring in a ton of variables, like family size, cost of living, cost of driving, etc.)\n\nI have usually gone by the guidance that a financed vehicle (no more than 6%, no more than 48 months) should be MAXIMUM 30% of your income under $30,000 and increasing 2% for every additional $10,000. That runs out to $9,000 car or $211/mo.\n\n32% under $40k; $12,800 or $301/mo\n\n34% under $50k; $17,000 or $399/mo\n\n36% under $60K; $21,600 or $507/mo\n\n38% under $70k; $26,600 or $625/mo\n\n40% under $80k; $32,000 or $752/mo\n\nthis is, of course, paying all taxes, transfer, and tags up front with cash saved up. I would also not go into the purchase without also having at least 10% of the vehicle purchase price in savings for repair emergencies. Buying a car more than this guideline with less money saved up seems like a disaster waiting to happen.  Just a thought.",

For 1 he tells people not to contribute to a 401k at all if they have debt, even if you could get an employer match.  But most employer matches are so much better than the interest rates on even high interest loans that you come out way ahead contributing enough to get the match and taking longer to pay off the debt.  Dave is very anti debt, but not all debt is bad.  Why should i pay cash for a car if I can get it for the same price financed at a very low interest rate and invest that money?  ",

It's probably a much better idea to put that stuff on hold while you attack debt.  \n\nRamsey says that debt is \"dumb\", not \"bad\".  He acknowledges that rich people usually do better by financing large assets versus the opportunity cost of unparking investments in order to avoid debt.  If you are in that wealth bracket, you are already beyond Ramsey's \"baby steps\".  He is educating people who have neither wealth nor discipline.",

The loan payment is an estimate at 5%, and your interest rate might be a little lower, or maybe you had a trade-in/down payment that reduced the financed amount. You have a college degree, probably have a clean driving record, and likely live in a relatively low-crime zip code, all of which would lower your insurance payment. But when all is said and done, you do come in right at the lower end of the given monthly range of $500-700 for your total of loan payment + insurance + gas. ",

We keep asking ourselves, \"What do we *need* this vehicle for?\" The answer is, \"To last us until the kids start moving out and/or get their own cars.\" (which is 10 years). At that point, our vehicular needs are different.\n\nSo, our current one (2001) lasted 16 years. We bought it in 2007-ish. So that means we could conservatively look for a used 2012-2014 range vehicle. Right there, we're now looking at ~$10-$15k rather than $35-$40k. $10-$15k we can pay in cash w/o much issue. $35-$40k would be possible but not without setting back other more important plans (e.g. college savings for kids).\n\nAfter another 10 or so years when most of our kids are no longer dependent on us for transportation we'll again be in need to buy a car. At that point it might make sense to buy new since our future transportation needs will be consistent for the foreseeable future and so we could possibly invest more and take advantage of the full life of a vehicle. I personally hope that in 10 years all-electric vehicles will be much more the norm.\n\nEDIT: We may be in the $20-$24k range if we opt for AWD (which our previous one had and we loved). AWD is just nice for areas that get snow/ice periodically.",

It only had 30k miles and since I was buying direct from the dealership as certified used, the original warranty transferred to me. They even let me pick brand new leather seats of the color of my choosing for an extra  grand. The car came with a 10yr warranty and (9 years in it left when I bought it) or 120k miles, whatever happened first. I absolutely love that car. It's 3 years old right now and most people still ask me if it's brand new. (I take really good care of it). May car payment is only $270 and have not had any major  issues with it. There have been a couple of recalls for which they have notfied me about and when I've had to bring the car to the dealership for anything, they give me a loaner. And they throw in a free car wash an vacuum every time. I think 1 year old certified cars it's really where it's at, at least for me. And my next car will also be a certified used.",

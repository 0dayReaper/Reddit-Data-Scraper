    "postText": "I'm writing this because the Reddit threads on this topic are outdated and more people should know what I now know about the \"new\" timeshares. This is what it's like to be on the receiving end of a Wyndham timeshare sales pitch. Here goes:\n\n\nI vaguely knew what I was getting in to. My girlfriend and I arrived at an MGM owned casino. We get a bite to eat and as soon as we began our exploration of the Casino someone approached us offering vouchers for free play in the casino worth $75. I'm usually hesitant to ever get sucked into something like this but my girlfriend insisted that we do it. \"They give it to you for showing up, we'll just say no, I've got friends who did this too, etc.\" I went along and decided to keep an open mind about it.\n\n\nWe talk to this guy who convinces people to attend this \"seminar\" for two hours and you'll receive the vouchers, plus a hotel room for a few nights from a selection of locations, plus free breakfast. He insists that all you need to do is say \"no, not interested\" once the 2 hours are up and you can just leave with your vouchers. Obviously his incentive isn't to sell anything but fill the buses with as many people as possible.\n\n\nThe next day we get on the bus to the seminar location. My initial thought was that we'd all crowd into a room and watch some presentation before given the opportunity to bounce. I was caught off guard when every couple was assigned a salesperson. We meet our salesman and he immediately compliments us, is incredibly impressed by any of the words we string together, and has now become our fake best friend.\n\n\nWe go into the presentation and the speaker does his thing. And everyone here should be aware that much of what he said was true, but his conclusions were abhorrent. He pointed out that in America we do not use all of our vacation days. We tend to waste them. We are also constantly putting off that one trip to our dream destination to \"someday\", but \"someday\" never comes. Next, he points out that most people, dying people, regret working so much and wish they spent more time with their families. These are true facts.\u00a0\n\n\nBut then he concluded by suggesting we should all buy into this program which will allow us to take these dream vacations. It was the kind of sound financial advice you'd expect from someone who would directly benefit from the purchase and would never hear from you again.\n\n\nI want to note, the speaker was talented and entertaining. He was loaded with jokes, self-deprecating humor. It was funny, but holy shit. Looking around the room were the salespeople with the obnoxious fake laughter. They saw this probably a hundred times. It was creepy. It was surreal. 1/3 of the audience was in on the sales pitch.\u00a0\n\n\nThe salespeople used every joke as an opportunity to measure the responses on the faces on their paired couple. The speaker would crack a joke and all the sales people would simultaneously throw their back out laughing before turning to the couple they were with to see if they were laughing too.\u00a0\n\n\nThere were no opportunities for me to speak with my girlfriend without the salesman eavesdropping. The presentation moved fast enough that looking anything up seemed like too much of a distraction. As skilled as they seemed at controlling my behavior, the whole thing was throwing up red flags.\n\n\nAnyway, the presentation ended and our salesman led us to a table. On the way over there were other couples sitting out in the open with their assigned salesperson. They seemed excited about what they were hearing and excitedly signing papers. It was...weird.\n\n\nWe sit down and the salesman goes through the program in more detail. Here's where I get genuinely turned off. I work in IT, I'm about to finish my bachelor's degree, I don't think I'm a sucker but my love of science puts me at odds with a person who's giving me overwhelmingly biased information. He reiterates all of the great things about this program. He turns to my girlfriend, \"what do you think about that?\" \"It sounds great!\" Then he turns to me. \"And what do you think about that? Is it something you'd want to do?\" And I reply \"Depending on the cost, yes, I'd do it!\"\n\n\nNext, he has us estimate the cost of a hotel we normally pay for. Then he asks us how many vacation days we take per year. This is fine and easy math. If the average cost is $115 per night, and you take 10 days, it's $1,150 per year in hotel costs. The \"program\" (timeshare but they completely avoid the term) lasts 20 years. It's still vague at this part but the salesman insists on focusing on how much we are gonna pay for these hotel rooms over the next 20 years.\n\n\nCost per year multiplied by 20 years is 23,000. But that's ***not*** the equation they're doing. They're not accounting for interest! Ah! It would be more over that time! How much does it really cost? About $250,000. They estimate that the hospitality industry has an inflation rate of 11%!! Everyone should have it ingrained in their heads that inflation across the entire economy (in America) has been around 3% per year.\u00a0\n\n\nHe was willing to tinker with the numbers but, generally speaking, we're spending a fuck ton of money on just hotels according to their calculations. And any close observers would note that the number **should have been much lower**. $1,300\u00d720 years\u00d71.1^20 = $174,914.99. I could have been wrong in my calculation but their cost estimate was obscenely high.\n\n\nDisclaimer: As several people pointed out, some of that math is off and I used the incorrect equation (this does not change the conclusions). Here is a better description from a more qualified redditor /u/mowscut:\n\n&gt;As an actuary, both yours and their calculators bothered me. No idea where 250k comes from, but your calculation assumes you\u2019re paying the fully inflated price (in 20 years) for every payment. The full value is a simple future value of annuity certain formula which is P[(1+i)n -1]/i where i is the interest, n the number of payments and P the payment amount. This gives 1,300(1.120 -1)/.11~83,000. Which is also a crazy number, but formulaically appropriate.\n\n\nThen he asks if we have any more questions. Uh, yeah, how much are we talking about here? They never mentioned up to this point how much it costs! But I'm skeptical and the questions I'm asking are things like how do you actually book a vacation? What happens if I change my mind about it? Is it transferrable? The salesman doesn't know the answers to these questions so a higher level salesman comes over. He's very happy to meet us. He loves the outfit I'm wearing. He compliments various other features and, with the limited amount of information I've provided, seems completely ready to compete with the other salesman for the title of my new best friend.\n\n\nHe answers some of my questions but can't provide any documentation to back up his claims. They still won't provide a price but they hand an iPad to my girlfriend to start filling out personal information. I look over and as soon as I see there's a field for the social security number I damn near slap it out of her hands. They were literally going to do a credit check to see how much the cost would be for us! Huge red flag for me. First, the inquiry shows up on your credit report. While that may not be so bad, I want to be informed on making a purchase and at least know a price range before taking that kind of step.\n\n\nThis throws the salesman off. Apparently, no one stops at this part of the process. The head sales guy says it's fine, and offers for us to check out a room which would be the type of room we'd be staying in if we join this program. *I still don't know how much this program costs*. We go and the salesman leaves my girlfriend and I alone to explore at our own pace.\u00a0\n\n\nThis is where I frantically looked for the Reddit thread where personal finance gurus say \"GET THE FUCK OUT OF THERE, THEY KIDNAP REDDITORS LIKE YOU AND YOUR CLONE BECOMES A SALESMAN\". I found a few threads, and they did warn against this, but they were at least a year old and it didn't all seem timely.\n\n\nI couldn't find costs online either, so I thought to myself \"how much per month would I be willing to pay for something like this?\" I concluded $45 per month. But I still had misgivings about making a big commitment on such short notice when I couldn't even read anything like a contract. I'd rather go home and read independent reviews so I can be confident in my decision. I couldn't get to that point.\n\n\nOnce again we end up back at the table but this time the salesman has a laminated piece of paper with prices on it! I immediately I see huge numbers and realize why they waited so long to show it. They wanted approximately $130,000 for the total program. It would be $13,000 down to get started, and almost $500 per month.\u00a0\n\n(Note: when I did the math later, the actual cost we'd likely pay is around what they wanted for the program. But we'd be paying a fortune upfront and have a monthly payment. We could only go to where Wyndham had properties, which was in America or Australia or some islands, but if we wanted to go to Europe it would be through RCI, which cost about $300 per week. That's about the cost of an AirBnB in some locations, so if you're a smart traveller it may not be worth it at all.)\n\n\n\"Would you rather pay this?\" The head salesman circles the $174,000. \"Or this\", he circles the $130,000. Ooga not want pay big number when ooga pay small number instead. I didn't want it. $45 dollars was as high as I'd go.\n\n\nThis is the part where they tried to pit my girlfriend against me in an amateurish attempt at manipulation. First, they go through the list of everything we ever told them about what we liked about the program (before we ever heard a price). They even sneak in a \"you should be willing to sacrifice something for it\" and gave a few examples like eating out less or having fewer cups of coffee from Starbucks. So I'm telling the salesman that this is way too expensive and once again the head sales guy shows up. He says things like \"I thought you said you liked the program? You said it was a 10/10. Are you saying it's not a 10/10? You said you'd be willing to sacrifice for this!\" He was getting irritated. Then he turned to my girlfriend and says \"it doesn't sound like he's as rich as he says he is\". At this point I was infuriated. Best friends don't say things like this to each other. But I held my cool. I looked him dead in the eye and firmly said \"I'm gonna pass\".\u00a0\n\n\nBut damn, the manipulation didn't stop and they didn't give up. They leave us alone to fill out a brief survey with a guy who definitely doesn't sell anything. So this guy shows up, introduces himself, and asks us about why we didn't buy it. I was truthful, it was too expensive and I wasn't willing to spend all that for it. I also felt pressured to make a big commitment on something that hours earlier I knew nothing about. So then he offers to sell us a \"trial\" program. It's a fraction of the price and it only lasts two years. It starts to be appealing, but then it is also limited to certain locations. I ask to see the contract and the guy says \"what do you want me to do, sit here and read you a contract\"? At that point he gets frustrated and offers to walk us to the exit. It had been 4 hours. We get our vouchers and leave.\n\nTl;dr: it would have been a bad financial decision.\n\nEdit: There are a TON of stories in this thread from people who have had experiences with timeshares.

Considering the amount of buyer's remorse you can find online about timeshare purchases, you can bet they sell quite a few.

Every 20 minutes or so, they'd get up and ring a bell and congratulate the new family they just signed on.  The only difference is, when I glanced over at the \"winning\" table, I didn't see a bunch of excited people ready to enjoy their new purchase, I saw a group of people that look like they've just spent the last several hours getting the mental crap beaten out of them and the look was little more than utter defeat.

They pair unused salespeople up as couples.  Count in the room would now be 20 salespeople and 10 targets, or 2/3 are now paid actors.\n\nI would go so far as to suggest that they run the whole show even if only 1 couple shows up.  You'd have your very own Truman show, you and your mate are an organic pair, everyone else in the room is just playing a role - 20 salespeople and 2 targets (90% actors).\n\nThe timeshare presentation I went to a decade ago went exactly as the description above.  The \"actor\" bit really hit home with me - not only was this a terrible financial decision and a *really* transparent one at that - other couples were inking on the dotted line to buy a $100k timeshare after 5 minutes.  It did not occur to me that these were actors until later, I was just like wtf is going on here?  10 couples in the room and after I've asked the guy what the price is for the 14th time, the 3rd couple has just signed a contract and we're all applauding each time.  I am educated, financially savvy, had a strong plan going in on a strategy with my wife, and after 15 minutes I was seriously considering it.  They are GOOD at what they do.",

My aunt entered me into a raffle for an all expense paid honeymoon. I got a call saying I'd won and was super lucky. All I had to do was attend a small demonstration at this nice hotel. They were demoing some really nice ceramic cookware but we were planning our wedding and trying to start our lives, I wasn't prepared to go into debt to buy some cookware. I remember the guy kept saying stuff like \"you'll never see this cook set again if you don't buy it today.\" Anyway, it was a really convincing demonstration and I was close to caving but I pumped the brakes hard when they started talking financing...I was like, \"no cookware is worth a credit check and monthly payments.\" We walked out with our packet for the trip, but ultimately didn't use it since the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth.",

As soon as the 2 hours is up they say \"No\" and leave with the vouchers. I don't know what percentage that would be but I know there was at least a few. The speaker called them out for their completely disinterested faces. The couple next to us didn't have a salesperson only about 10 minutes in. \n\nWhen we left the presentation and were taken to a table, we were surrounded by tables with couples at them. I completely ignored them but my girlfriend said she saw one of them enthusiastically signing. This was immediately after the first presentation of the day. And she noticed a monthly payment of over $1,000! She noted that they had two kids but it just seems hard to believe. \n\nI took the earliest presentation available but it's possible an earlier one was sold out and this couple was left over from that.",

The price started at $26,000, I kept saying no, the price got down to $13,000 plus monthly payments. I just laughed at them and was amazed that every single person in that room was signing papers. I did receive the discount Disney tickets, and the 3 college tuitions have been successfully paid for.  I have not heard from my new best friends in 20+ years.",

My wife and kids slept in the rental car, and I just wandered around the KOA. I did get to see a key deer though since I couldn\u2019t sleep. That was awesome.\n\nAnyway, we had comp\u2019ed airline tickets, but the return flight was cancelled at ORD due to weather.  The next available flight was a week out (Frontier). So we could\u2019ve dropped a ton of money on last minute tickets, or just make a vacation out of it.\n\nSo we head up to Orlando and stay at one of the resorts. The freaking hot water was out the whole time we were there. They ended up comp\u2019ing the suite because of it.  I\u2019m pretty sure one of my kids washed her hair in one of the hot tubs.\n\nThere was a booth at this resort for discounted Disney tickets. All you had to do was get bussed to the Wyndham and listen to a \u201c1 hour presentation\u201d.\n\nThe Wyndham story could be a post of its own. We finally got our tickets and headed to Disney. They had a record turn out that day at Magic Kingdom. Elbow to elbow everywhere you went.\n\nNothing about that trip was good. If I even bring up Florida my kids in unison cry, \u201cNo!\u201d",

When I looked into it, I was paying for the housekeeping, a new retaining wall at the hotel, roofing replacements, etc. All in exchange for what amounted to 1 week per year! \n\nAlthough, now being through it I know that I can sit through one of those presentations and 100% without a doubt leave buying nothing. I'm scarred lol although, not scarred enough to not get free stuff lol",

About 5 years ago, we went to one in Vegas where we got three nights in a lux hotel, two dinner vouchers (we chose sushi buffet), two show tickets (we chose a magic show playing at the D), and 5,000 hotel chain points all for $300. There was also a $100 voucher of some sort, but I can't remember if we spent that or not. \n\nWe went to the presentation and were immediately assigned a best friend/salesperson, no larger presentation. She started asking us about jobs, etc., on the way up the elevator and my BF started joking with her, saying it was top secret or some shit. We sat down at a table-sized touch screen where she showed us the program overview which probably took 30 minutes tops. When they did the calculate your vacation, my BF decided his dream vacation would be tent camping in the Canadian wilderness and hunting moose. We argued over whether you would have to pay nightly permit fees to camp there. At some point she actually said something like, \"Listen, just pick a vacation and let us get through this.\"\n\nThey did eventually send over the \"big guns\" where they laid out the pricing and we basically laughed when they said the money down number. We were in and out in well under two hours. I would definitely do it again, but it seems like our experience is atypical.",

I got a call from Hilton out of the blue, offering me a free hotel in Vegas if I would attend a time share meeting while there. I got a few pricing options and wound up settling on a 4 night stay in a 2 bedroom suite for $100 per night; plus getting $150 in vouchers and 10,000 Hilton Points. I call 7 of my buddies - \"boys we're going to Vegas\".  \nThe third day is when the dreaded meeting comes. 10:00am at the timeshare presentation, and I have a hangover worse than Ed Helms'. They pair me up directly with a sales guy, I try to follow along, and need to excuse myself to go blow chunks in the bathroom. I come back 5 minutes later, they get me coffee and a mini muffin, and I try to follow the pitch. Everything sounds great - stay anywhere around the world, tons of points and opportunities to use it for regular travel blah blah blah. I have to hurl again. I spend the next 45 minutes hugging the porcelain throne before stumbling back out. At that point the sales guy has fully given up on me and moved on to another customer. I complain and they just hand me my vouchers and shuffle me out the door about an hour after turning up.  \n\n\nWorth it.",

All the same tactics such as making me feel bad, manipulation etc.. Keep in mind I have been travelling non-stop for the last 4 years so time shares make 100% no sense for me but I have never been exposed to high pressure sales before which is how they got me to sign up for their trial program.\n\nAll these time share contracts include a window, mine was 5 days, to get out cleanly and get a complete refund. So if for some reason you really do want the free stuff (I got up to $250 in value with $100 in cash which is far more than the OP got fortunately) and they manage to get you to sign, realize you can get out of it the next day by sending a letter.\n\nWhat is missing from their \"math\" is a lot. Firstly, the cost per night around the world is highly variable. In some developing countries you can get entire mansions for $150/night. More importantly than that what they will fail to mention is you are not buying \"cash\" value you are buying \"credit\" value. The value of a credit is what they set it at and they have the ability to change it to whatever they want. So while they will pitch you that you are saving money due to inflation you actually don't because they decrease the value of credits with time.\n\nIt's not worth it.\n\nTo make it all even worse even if you really wanted to do a time share, you can purchase time shares on the secondary market for 25-50 cents on the dollar.",

It's most commonly illustrated in the [Asch conformity experiments from the 1950s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments) &amp; is a common topic in most Psychology 101 courses.\n\nIn this particular case, if you decided not to conform to the group by remaining stoic or non-responsive to the speaker and his jokes you would have begun to feel awkward or out of place. This unsettling feeling would cause you to want to conform to the group (as noted in the Asch experiments) by laughing and engaging positively with the sales pitch.\n\nThere's actually quite a bit more that can be illustrated in the other parts of your story, but this one stood out the most to me.",

            "comment": "I did one of these with my ex-wife about 15 years ago. I'm not kidding you, NOTHING has changed in that 15 years. Your description was basically spot-on identical. A few standout details I remember:\n\nOur salesman, who loved us, and wanted to be our best friend forever, had JUST started this job a couple of days ago, by gigantic coincidence! I don't remember what he did before that, but I think it was something like construction, so it was incredible just how quickly he adjusted to sales in literally two days!\n\nDuring the video presentation he regularly joked with us, made wise cracks in response to the speaker, and really made us feel like he was our buddy. Meanwhile my wife and I whispered a couple things to each other and chuckled lightly as we recognized the various issues with their pitch. Our salesman, the most kind, jovial, best of friends would glance at us, but things were still great. Then there was a point where they have all of us introduce ourselves and say a little about what we do. One guy mentioned being a musician and gave his name, and my wife was interested in looking him up later, so she wrote his name down on a scrap of paper and handed it to me to to keep.\n\nSuddenly our best friend spins around and with the coldest expression possible says \"alright, that's it, we're taking you out of here.\" He then proceeds to stand up, collect our things for us off the table, and march us out of the presentation room as people stare aghast in confusion. He tells us that we've been disruptive the entire time, whispering to each other, talking back, not taking things seriously (all the things that he'd been doing), and passing notes. We were going to have to leave and forfeit the refund on the free hotel stay we'd already paid for. My wife was in tears in shock at this sudden treatment we were receiving.\n\nA manager was called, and he explained everything to her, including the note. I took the note out of my pocket. \"This note?\" \"Yep, that's the one.\" I handed to the manager for her to read, as I explained exactly what it was. She looked at it, and asked him to step aside where she talked to him for a bit before she came back to us. We never saw him again.\n\nShe then proceeded to apologize profusely and tell us we didn't need to stay any longer, she would credit us for our trouble right away, and we could go home. She asked what show we'd gotten, and we explained that we had the mini-vacation instead, so the three nights of stay. She paused, looked uncomfortable, and then explained that she can't just comp that. If we were to get that refunded, we would have to still go through the entire rest of the presentation.\n\nSo for the next hour she toured us through the facility and rooms, with my wife streaming tears down her face, none of us happy, as the manager pretended there was any chance we were going to buy anything, and we just looked miserable.\n\nThe sales tactics in the end were the same as you mentioned, especially with all of the psychological warfare of using our prior words against us, and treating us like we were dishonest or fools for contradicting ourselves. Then we got to the survey round that was by a totally not salesperson, although this one didn't offer us trials, but these fractional packages that were the equivalent of refurbished vacations, shared plans with other people, etc., with all sorts of restrictions. Eventually we had one MORE final survey which was the last no-nonsense person who genuinely wasn't a salesperson and was there just to get our details, take our feedback (boy did we have a lot) and hand us literal cash for the value of our hotel stay.\n\nThis was a horrible experience, and 15 years later it sounds identical, and just as not worth it as ever.",

You'll notice that salesperson is *always* dating or married to someone in the room (usually the lead sales person). They play off that \"relationship\" to give you a bunch of insight into their lives... it's human nature to *trust* these people who have welcomed you into their lives. More than that **you don't want to let them down.** It's what the whole thing depends on.",

If you don't mind losing 2-4 hours out of one your days, you can get some cool \"free\" stuff. (It is free, but you trade your precious vacation time for these things.) Just go in knowing you will say no at every turn. Know the games they will play. Just keep saying no. Be polite, but firm. Keep saying no.\n\nYou were smart in how you handled it all, never filling out any sort of personal information.",

I was young and in love- so this cheap vacation with a few strings attached seemed like a good idea. The first time we listened to the pitch it took forever, and they got aggressive-ish. Honestly, it sucked. But, I had an idea. The next one, as soon as I had a chance I said \"sounds great- I'll take it\". The salesperson was ecstatic, asked about payment, said \"well I dont have a credit card\", asked about where I worked, lied-said I was unemployed. Tried to get me to borrow the money from family, called my dad- on the spot... Asked to borrow the down payment, he laughed and said \"f*** no\". We were in and out of the 2nd pitch in like 30 mins....",

My incredibly soft husband was falling for the pitch and the $100 vouchers and free steak dinner they were offering. I looked the guy in the eye and said no, absolutely not. When he asked why I said that my time is way too precious to waste in a boring timeshare presentation being pressured to buy something I don't want and no offer of free stuff would convince me otherwise. In the midst of him trying to soften me up he asked me what I was into. He had no free tickets for anything I was actually interested in but he pointed me to Zombie Burlesque which ended up being fucking fabulous. So that was a win.",

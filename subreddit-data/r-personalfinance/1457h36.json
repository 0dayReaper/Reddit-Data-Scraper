    "postText": "So this is the first my portfolio has broken even in about a year. I want to buy a house in a year or two. I made the mistake of investing about 90% of my savings into ETFs in November 2022, thinking it was a sure way to increase my savings before I make the big purchase. Obviously that was probably the worst time to invest, but now that it has recovered I want to take everything out and put it into a much more safer savings account like a CD. \n\nMy main question is what should I consider when pulling my money out? Are there any taxes even though I didn\u2019t make any money? I just don\u2019t want to put in 20k and pull out 20k to find out I owe 3k in taxes or fees or something like that. \n\nI\u2019m currently invested about 85% in vanguard ETFs and about 5-6% in Robinhood random stocks. \n\nPlease help me get my money back and into an actual savings account!",

Gains on one security are offset by losses on another if they are realized in the same calendar year so for tax purposes it's really how much you made or lost in aggregate that matters.  If you're saying you're breaking even then there won't be any tax bill.",

            "comment": "If all of your purchases were in the past 12 months, then any realized gains or losses are considered short term and will be treated as part of your taxable income this year (taxed at your marginal tax rate).  Gains and losses will be calculated on each lot of shares that you bought and sold, but it's the net that's important.\n\nIf you're exactly break-even on your aggregate portfolio then you will owe zero additional taxes.\n\nIf your net gains are $1k and you're in the 22% tax bracket, you'll owe $220, etc.  If you have more losses than gains, you can up to $3k to reduce your taxable income this year, and if your net losses are greater than that you can track it and carry it forward to next year.\n\nFees from your trading platform are another story, I can't comment on that but I would imagine any fees should be disclosed and taken during the sale.\n\nETA: You can probably keep your money in a brokerage and invest in money market funds.  Not sure what's available on your platform but these will have a stable value ($1/share) and pay dividends monthly, most are currently yielding about 4.8-5.1%.  CD's are another option if you want to lock in current rates for a year or so.",

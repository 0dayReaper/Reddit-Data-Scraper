    "postText": "1st car I hope?\n\nI know this is a really easy car question maybe question, but my dad passed away and he was my mechanic/go to person for this kinda stuff. \n\nAnyways long story short, I got my first good job as a welder, and I want to get my own vehicle, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s shitty or not, just to get from work and back without having to use my moms extra car she lets me use. \n\nBut I don\u2019t have a credit score because I didn\u2019t wanna ruin my score, but I\u2019m wondering how hard it\u2019ll be to get someone to trust me to get even a piece of shit car. I have like 1300$ saved up from my first 2 week checks after my other bills, so I know I can afford the monthly payments.\n\nThank you for the help, enjoy your weekend",

Buy a car that's good on fuel economy, and easy on insurance as much as possible. When dealing with dealers I strongly recommend sending an email to them asking about itemized out the door price, you can gauge what your payments will be from there on, there are calculators out there. Anyways, any self respecting dealer will give you itemized price for the car.",

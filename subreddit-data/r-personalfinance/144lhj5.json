    "postText": "Im looking to consolidate some debt and even though i have good credit (730is) I cant seem to find a good rate. Ive searched online, did a few online applications but the rates are ridiculous. Even went to penfed.org as Ive had vehicle loans with them before but same rates. \n\nAny good lenders with rates lower than 10%?\n\nI recently got a letter from a supposed lender with 3% rate, but after searching I found a reddit post that stated the company was a scam.",

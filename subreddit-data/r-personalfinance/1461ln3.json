Our pension plan just got frozen, so I had them run some numbers for me ... and they told me that with lump sum, the actual amount decreases over time. So if I retire five years from now, I will have 40K less in a lump sum than I would if I retired today. They said it's because the lump sum is based on the annuity value over time, and since later retirement means less time alive, the annuity amount I would receive would be less ... therefore, lump sum amount is also less. So I am apparently stupid, but I had no idea this is how pensions work. I guess I'm just venting. I mean, is that really how lump sums work? Does it have to do with the fact that's it's frozen now?",

I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re offering a lump sum payout right now or the option but to start monthly payments when you  \u201cretire\u201d?",

So when I learned I was stupid, it completely depressed me and pissed me off. :-/ I kinda feel like a schmuck working when I know I lose money each month in that pension. My first reaction was, SCREW YOU, I QUIT. But then cooler heads prevailed (i.e., spouse), and then I just got mad at myself for not planning properly. Anyway, thanks so much for posting a reply!",

The older you are, the fewer years you are expected to be alive to collect the pension. Thus, the present value of the payments is lower.\n\nAs an example, let's say your pension benefit is $50k per year for the remainder of your life. Let's also simply and say the interest rate is 0%. \n\nIf you are currently 65 and your expected future lifetime is, say, 15 years, the present value of the payments is around 15*$50k = $750k. \n\nNow, let's instead wait until you are 75, and your expected future lifetime is now about 9 years. The present value of the payments is now around 9*$50k = $450k.\n\nI am simplifying, and making up the expected future lifetime numbers. In reality, they will use a standardized actuarial table to calculate these values, including the value of interest, which is reflected in the annuity values.",

He is not collecting the pension payments while working.\n\n&gt;So as time passes, the commuted value of the pension should go up even if no more contributions are made.\n\nFor a cash balance pension plan, or a defined contribution plan, there is an account set up which can continue to accrue interest even after contributions are no longer made. OP is instead describing a defined benefit plan. Under a defined benefit plan, the company promises a certain payout every year (or month). The annual payout would be defined, for example, as 2.5% of final salary per year worked. If OP has a salary of $100k and has worked ~~25~~ 20 years at the moment the pension is frozen, his benefit is frozen at $50k per year for life from the moment he retires. Since the pension is frozen, this benefit will not increase.",

Working 5 more years reduces the time horizon (they're tables are probably tied to \"on average, people die at age ... So we use payments until that age as our baseline\"). Since it's frozen, your annual payout isn't increasing, but your time horizon is decreasing.\n\nIs your employer switching people to a 401k?

I'm pretty sure I know what's going on here, and it doesn't really have anything to do with what's described yet.\n\nPension plan lump sums are valued at a required mortality table and set of interest rates that are prescribed under IRS code section 417(e)(3).  The lump sum you'd receive today, and the amount that you were given, were based on these rates for the current plan year.  The mortality table changes annually, and the lump sum rates are published monthly; your plan has a certain month for its lookback and that's how the calculations are done.\n\nAny projection for a future year are based on a different set of rates - the rates for the assumptions within the plan.  Normally, these rates are significantly higher than the rates for lump sums, but, as the 417 rates for 2028 won't be published for a long time, this is the only assumption that can be made.\n\nThis is what is seen on one of the required disclosures for distributions - the relative value disclosure.\n\nThis is likely why a projection for down the road is smaller.  The rates are higher.\n\nEDIT: As for what they told you about 5 years from now, even though the plan is frozen, you'd get an actuarial increase on your annuity value (and thus your lump sum) if you're past the plan's normal retirement age. This likely also was not taken into account in the projection.",

Similarly, if OP is eligible for an unreduced (or otherwise subsidized) early retirement benefit, they would expect to lose value by deferring commencement.",

Your may be different but big corps like GM and Ford are required to use the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp calculations when determining the difference between taking a monthly annuity payment vs lump sum.\n\nThe higher the interest rates the less the lump sum. Interest rates obviously have increased substantially over the last 18 months.",

Yours must be a defined benefit plan thus they are calculation your life expectancy into the calculation.  These plans most often steer you away from the lump sum and towards the monthly payment or annuity.    They do this because most people only collect their pension benefit for 18 years and retire at 63.",

            "comment": "That doesn't sound right to me.\nGenerally, money now is worth more than money later. So a lump sum of $x now is more valuable than an LS of $x in 5 years. Therefore, even though you will have a shorter expected annuity in 5 years, you will be receiving the money 5 years later and the amount should increase, probably enough to offset the decreased lifespan (though that does depend on interest rates and mortality table)\n\nWithout seeing the mortality table and interest rates, I can't say anything definitively. However, I strongly suspect they're failing to include the deferral period in the calculation.",

            "comment": "So the lump sum payout is based on the present value of expected (defined) benefits. And since you are no longer accruing benefits (I assume that's what \"frozen\" means) you will receive the same fixed payment when you retire and if you retire later, you are expected to receive fewer of them. Hence reduced lump sum payout.\n\nMaybe you can ask whoever administers the pension if you can cash it out today and roll it over into a 401k?",

The process was very easy.  I just initiated the transfer from Fidelity and had to upload a recent statement and then 7-10 days later it was all moved over.  Depending on the OP\u2019s HSA, they may be able to transfer their assets directly without selling.",

Is it because your employer is not amenable to shifting its excess payroll funds into the product if you don't stay with the scheme operator it picked?",

My assumption is that this is the bank that my hdhp is tied to through our benefits platform. \n\nDoes it not matter which banking option I choose or is it case by case based on the employer benefits?

This is only a ~7% one time tax for all your contributions, compared to your monthly fees, so weigh which one is more beneficial. And don\u2019t forget if you get a yearly contribution from you employer.\n\nYou are allowed to contribute to any HSA as long as you are eligible, and don\u2019t go over the combined limit, which includes employer contributions, just make sure you deduct on your schedule 1. (Workplace contributions don\u2019t count as wages, but voluntary contributions must be filled out on the schedule 1, which is still really easy).\n\nMeanwhile, you are allowed an unlimited trustee-to-trustee transfers per year. So if your fee is % based, transfer to another HSA. If it\u2019s a flat monthly fee, maybe contribute to a fee free provider instead of your workplace.",

It's inherently chained to \"HDHP\" enrollment but otherwise has nothing to do with health insurance.\n\nIt makes a difference which scheme operator you pick if you're averse to paying the scheme operator a nominal fee for being the scheme operator (you've said you are), and/or you're not ok with the scheme operator's speculative offerings that can't, don't, won't, and haven't at least met the historical rate of retail health bill inflation so you at least break even on \"HSA,\" and/or you're not ok with your employer cutting off its excess payroll funds going into the product if you pick a different scheme operator than the one it picked.\n\nOher than those 3 scenarios it really doesn't matter which scheme operator you pick.",

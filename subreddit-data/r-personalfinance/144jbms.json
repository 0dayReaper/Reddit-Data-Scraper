    "postText": "So i have a girlfriend...a therapist who works for the state and on the side making approx 90k a year. somehow, she has gotten herself into 45k in credit card debt wiht zero to show for it, and i dont want to know where it went. she is fresh out of a separation and divorcing. she cant afford rent and is living in a trailer her aunt owns. i dont know what to do for her. these numbers are approx:\n\n27k in a consolidated loan @ 14% @ Bi monthly 282.00\n\n(1) 1500.00 @ 25% not sure on minimum payment\n\n(2) 4k  and 5k both at approx 25% at like 250 a month minimum payments\n\nshe has been making more than minimum payments, but its crushing her and something is going to break soon. we are looking at getting a mortgage a year down the road.\n\nBankruptcy chapter 7 is not an option as she owns a small piece of vacation property which she would die before she parted with it.\n\nchapter 13 doesn't seems like it would be beneficial, but i dont know which is why im here to ask people for help who are much smarter than me.\n\nShe has a retirement account with 70k in it, this is in addition to her pension from the state she is earning, so it isnt like it would crush her retirement.\n\nI am of the opinion she should attempt to negotiate with the credit card companies for a lump sum settlement using the retirement money. what capital gains and principle she loses in the retirement account is , i think, much less then what she would be paying out in interest over the next few years. Then she could take what she would have been shelling out to the predators and stuff that back into that retirement account.\n\nshe also has a divorce agreement paying her 900 a month to start in a few months, but like i tell her this isnt guaranteed. I wonder if this is something a JGWentworth company would buy, a structured divorce agreement?\n\nrolling the debt into a mortgage might be possible down the road, but this will also close us out of alot of house ! we will have to accept terms and a house much worse than would we could get otherwise as i have a significant down payment, but not when your tacking on 40k in debt.  but the hemorrhaging of money to interest needs to stop now. ive also considered yet another consolidation loan, but the calculator i looked at for the one she has currently is threw the roof.\n\nthe vacation property is owned free and clear, im not sure of its value just a small piece of land next to some pond she loves with a tow behind trailer on it. this can be leveraged?\n\nher father has a few acres of property he is giving her, but thats too fluid and up in the air to make anything of it, as it has to be sub divided for the rent to own tenant he has in the house currently.\n\nI love her, but we have had problems and our relationship is still too young for me to consider helping her, not that i really could without breaking myself , all eggs in one basket . i have excellent credit 30k down payment. i think we can swing a 1200 mortgage, much more if this debt wasnt over her head\n\nim hoping any advice someone might have on how to approach this. credit counseling has not been started, but thats still an option as well. the chapter 13 bankruptcy as well. i just dont know, but it seems to me no matter the situation, the retirement account should be used to get out of this hole and hopefully shes learned her lesson. i think she has. I dont know how to show her in plain numbers how paying the debt as she has been and will be is far worse than the lose of the retirement account.\n\nEDIT: how can i show her how much interest she will pay over the life of these debts v. the loss of compounding interest and principle, plus withdrawal penalties, from the retirement account...\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

You're on here talking about $40k of credit card debt, not being able to afford rent and living in a family trailer, but at the same time, she has a vacation property free and clear that she refuses to part with.  Priorities are very much out of order here.",

My advice is to come down to reality, and understand that she\u2019s in no position to have vacation houses when she can\u2019t afford to put a roof over her head.  Sell the vacation property and use that to pay down the debt.  Get on a realistic budget, pick up a 2nd job, and grind down the debt.  What you want to hear is that there\u2019s some magic form of bankruptcy and/or debt settlement that will magically wipe half this debt while maintaining a good credit score so the two of you can buy a house on favorable terms in a few years, while keeping all your toys and extra property.  That\u2019s not realistic.  And falling back on the idea that she should cash out her retirement, pay a flat 10% penalty to burn money she doesn\u2019t have, and then pay income taxes on the lump sum, is a poor idea as well.",

I have taken what you said, it is advice. but what ive asked is what are the numbers for paying off the debt with retirement account and take whatever money she would have been paying the credit cards and putting that right back . if she can pay the debt down in a year, than she can replace what she takes in a year. somewhere the time value of money gets lost in taxes and fees for taking the money out vs. what she would pay in interest on this money. she has every bit of right to hold on to her camp because it makes her happy. she messed up, she can pay her debt and will. but she cant get back the piece of property that has been her family. and as far as toys, she has none. so its all very realistic. do you have an opinion on paying off the debt with the retirement account money?",

Anybody who suggests that it\u2019s a good move without seeing a full budget breakdown from her is doing you a disservice.  How can anybody give you a payment plan idea when you don\u2019t know her full income, a full list of her expenses, and build out from there?  You talk about her being so well off that she can pay off $40k in debt in a year, but your post also says she cannot afford rent and is living in her aunt\u2019s trailer.  None of it adds up.  So if you want concrete advice with numbers and timelines and comparisons on budgeting hard vs cashing out retirement, you need to come with a more complete breakdown of where the money is going right now.  And all of her existing debts/balances/interest rates.",

I guess i just thought you could rough cut one way or another wihtout all the specifics that paying off the debt now would cost LESS than paying it off over time. i gave payment amounts and APR and debt totals. i thought someone would be able to say \"shes going to pay X in interest v. taxes, penalties and loss of gains on the retirement\".  assume an 8% penalty, taxes at capital gains of 15%. i guess with alot of variables its not something you can say yes or no to, you are right. if she can pay the debt in a year, she can replace the retirement money in a year was my thinking. thanks for your time. why everyone concentrated on a little piece of camp , im sure i dont know. almost hostile. and we are talking intelligent people here. the sale of this little piece of property would only make a dent, but its gone for life.",

Very frugal living until they are gone. Then she can relax the frugality a little and pay off the rest, it may take a couple of years.

Then, she needs to figure out where she can cut back. The more she can cut back, the faster she'll be able to resolve this.\n\nThen I suggest the avalanche method - she throws all available money to the credit card with the highest interest. If the interest rates are the same, then to the card with the lowest balance (as in the snowball method). \n\nPulling from retirement should be the last option considered, as she will lose the interest gains. \n\nRe: buying a house- I strongly suggest that you do not buy a house together. You can buy one by yourself if you want to, and plan on her living with you and paying 'rent' ... but getting a house together means that it becomes one of her assets that creditors could go after.\n\nRe: credit cards - You don't have to go into debt or pay interest/fees to use a credit card. Using a credit card for purchases gives you more protection than using a debit card or cash, and you can earn points/cash back. It will also generally improve your credit, by showing a history of on-time payments.",

I ONLY use credit cards, havent carried a Debit in years. i use the credit cards for everything and pay the balance each month. earn points, better protection. you let people into your account and your screwed the bank does zero to help you. with credit cards even if they cant get the merchant to come off of the money i have had the CC refund me anyway. what i meant was i would ever buy anything with a credit card that required payments. Ive suggest this to her, to funnel all expenses and payments thru a card which you have on auto withdrawal each month, but she is scared to do it for some reason. \n\nhouse: she makes triple what i make. by myself im not sure what i can do. i just have excellent credit, zero debt and substantial savings, but my income is minimal. if not for this debt we would be sitting very well. \n\nretirement account: but this is exactly what i want to see the math on and i dont know how to do it...how can it be bad to pull the money from retirement and use whatever payments she would have made to go right back into it? yes she would lose significant gains, and there are penalties for taking the money, but how to do i figure it? its a level of math i cant do and dont know how to do.  i guess the first step would be to calculate how long and at what payment level she can pay down this debt and the interest incurred on it.  if she pulled that amount of money from retirement but instead of sending the money off to the creditors it goes right back into the retirement account i cant see how paying the creditors in payments is the better option. than of course there are the tax implications, whatever they are for the funds taken out.",

You can only \"negotiate\" with credit card companies if you stop paying on the debt, drag it out for months of non payment, then ask to negotiate for a lower amount -- which they might reject entirely out of hand and send the debt to a collection agency. \n\nAll of which would absolutely trash her credit score, which would go against your ultimate goal of buying a house together. Bankruptcy will also trash her credit score, and make qualifying for a decent mortgage really hard.\n\nThere's no magic way to get out from this debt that will preserve her credit score + ability to get a mortgage.",

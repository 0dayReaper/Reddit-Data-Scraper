You won't be able to spend it and future you will thank you. \n3. Implement the 72 hour rule. Anything you want to buy on impulse you have to wait 72 hours. Most likely you won't even remember what it was by then.",

You could also use a robo- investor site like Betterment (owned by Vanguard) so your money is actually invested in the stock market and then transfer it once you get enough. \n\nKeep your investments simple. Either use a target date fund (select the year closest to your 65th birthday) or an S&amp;P500 index fund. As you learn more you can consider personalizing your strategy if you want (not necessary though).",

Index funds like this are usually sold through brokerage firms like vanguard and shwab. Plus you want to use a retirement fund like an IRA so you get the tax benefits. If your income is low go with a Roth IRA. As your income grows and taxes become more of a concern you can look at traditional IRA options.",

Put your money that you dont need in CDs or treasury bills. They will yield you a return and they wont be accessible to you without a lot of pain so you are unlikely to waste the money.\n\nIn the meantime hopefully learn self-discipline and the ability to delay gratification.",

You can improve your lifestyle and toys with 20% of the gains from your investments. The remaining 80% of gains should be reinvested.\n\n2. Remember, every $100 you spend now, is really spending $1000. Why? Compounding value. Had you invested that money, you'd get a lifetime of growth and returns from it. Spending it now, you've lost not on the $100, but the compounding returns. The older you get, the less this applies, as you continue to approach the end of your lifespan. So ask yourself, do you really want that $5... I mean $50... cup of coffee?\n\nThe sooner you get these concepts and force yourself to learn about investment vehicles , the sooner you will be rich. And you'll understand why avacodo toast really does matter , while your peers are working, spending what they earn, and the some. Good luck.",

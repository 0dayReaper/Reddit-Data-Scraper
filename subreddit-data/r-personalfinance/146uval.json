    "postText": "Hello! I am 18 years old and I am an incoming first-year college student, studying actuarial science. I have $4,000 from my past summer jobs. My family is going to pay for my college but they aren't very financially literate so I don't know what to do with my money. Should I open a high yield savings? Open a student credit card? Dabble in stocks? Something else? I currently don't have any accounts to my name.\r  \n\r  \nThank you in advance for sharing your advice!",

You may want to split it between a checking account and savings, depending on what you already have in checking.\n\nGetting a credit card can be a good educational financial tool, but be sure that you are willing and able to pay it off in full every month. Having a card during college is an easy way to start racking up high interest debt if you're not careful. \n\nBeing financially smart now will mean you'll really thank yourself after college!",

Mine has free rollover if your checking hits 0 to draw from savings, and you have like 100 transfers a month which are practically instantaneous. Short of keeping a very small amount in when I know I'm paying a bill it seems like I'm just losing money keeping anything substantial in checking.",

If this is the case make sure you have a budget and stick to it or else that money could dwindle fast lol. \n\nIf truly everything is getting covered maybe ask for monthly allowance for these expenses and try to get that set up/discuss expectations or else you will have to pester them every time you need something and that would get old fast lol.",

It\u2019ll be $500+ for P and FM each for registration and study materials, and yes, buy something like coaching actuaries, college classes almost never teach you enough to pass the exams. I learned that the hard way. \n\nOnce you get passed prelim exams, you could be spending $1000+ per exam. Once you have a full time job, companies usually pay for exams and materials though. There are student discounts on many of the study material sites so look out for those! Because of costs, you\u2019ll want to remain pretty liquid. The more exams you pass, the more money you\u2019ll make out of college. \n\nI got two passed by the time I graduated and that seems like the standard. If you can get three or four, you\u2019ll be ahead of the curve and a great candidate. Passing exams freshman and sophomore years gives you a better chance to get summer internships, which you can make pretty good money from for the summer.",

It\u2019s good you\u2019re starting to think about money and your future and seek advice, that already puts you ahead of most people. \n\nIt\u2019s good to have emergency funds in something as liquid as possible.

You don\u2019t have the luxury of going out on Thursday nights or pulling all nighters on a weekday because you don\u2019t have class until 2 the next day forever. Enjoy them! Life as an actuary can be really tough when exams are coming. You sacrifice some of your social life to studying temporarily. It\u2019s good to have some funds to unwind after them! :) \n\nIf you want to put some of your money into an HYSA, go for it. It\u2019s never a bad idea to start saving. Unless you\u2019re planning on getting a job at college and working a good amount of hours, I\u2019d stay away from investing for now. When you pass a couple exams and get that internship money coming in, that\u2019s when you should start focusing on Roth IRAs and investments.

You only go through college once, so while being responsible is important, you also don\u2019t want to tie up all your resources and not be able to do fun stuff. \n\nGo open up a Discover student credit card. They\u2019re the best choice I\u2019ve come across in my research and talking to friends, across the board - credit limit, points, app that actually works reliably, etc. View the credit card as nothing more than a tool for building credit - don\u2019t go buying things you can\u2019t afford right at this very instant. Pretend it\u2019s a debit card, and be very strict with this mentality so you don\u2019t go off on a spending spree. \n\nDon\u2019t make the same mistake I did a couple years ago and pay it off the second you make the purchase - you have to actually get a statement and have an amount due for it to increase your credit, if you pay it off before that it will be as if you didn\u2019t use it at all. Only exception is, try and keep your utilization at or under 30% of the limit - if you go over that, pay the difference before you get your statement (this will probably happen a lot, your credit limit will probably be very low). Once you do get the statement, pay it off right away and in full.",

Open a high yield savings account. I use bread savings\n2. Open CD\u2019s and do a CD ladder. \n3. Get a credit card and use it accordingly.\n4. Open a Roth IRA and traditional IRA and invest. \n\nI\u2019ve done all of these things but it was later on in my life.",

I\u2019d recommend putting it all in an S&amp;P500 index mutual fund or ETF.  You are young and have the advantage of time, use compounding interest to grow that $4K into tens of thousands that will all be tax-free later in life.\n\nIf you can\u2019t bear the thought of saving it all, then decide how much you\u2019d like to put in an emergency fund in an online savings account, and put the remainder in a Roth IRA as above.",

            "comment": "Standard advice for your age would be to open a Roth IRA. The benefit to this is that you get taxed on the money you put in- not what you take out. If your investment of $1,000 turns into $10,000, then you only pay tax on the $1k.\n\nAlso, the compound interest year over year at such a young age makes a dramatic difference.\n\nStick to a safe ETF/mutual fund, be happy with your 8-12% returns and watch the money grow.\n\nObviously there are some restrictions, like you have to wait until your 59.5 years old, but there are some exceptions and workarounds.\n\nRead up more here: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rothira.asp",

Dont spend anything, become a ninja of not spending money.\n\nPick up change you see. Save your change. Dont use debit cards. Open a sofi credit card. Direct deposit your check to checking, this will get you bonus cash for starting direct deposit and theyll eventually give you 4.7% on your savings. \n\nUse the credit card to pay for gas and stuff. Pay your card early with the checking account in the sofi app. Do not over spend on the credit card and always pay early, in full. \n\nWhen your checking and savings hits 10-15k total, lock it down. Take 1k leave in checking- take 10k live it there. Take the rest and go to chase bank\n\nRinse and repeat.\n\nWhen you have business positive at all five major north american banks, its called the five fingers of wealth- Chase Jpmorgan, wells fargo, bofa, usbank, citi- you now have a reputation across the breadth of the financial industry as a wealthy person who manages their expenses well.\n\nDont talk to anyone about your money. Watch it grow. Eat like a peasant. Build your wealth.\n\nWhen you have 50k across your empire, youll be about 22-24 given youll make mistakes, heartache, troubles- now you must decide who you will partner with, if any, and what force or goal or mission should drive you.\n\nCan you continue working for others your entire life?\n\nHonor your mother and father, or whoever is your family, be kind to them and be grateful you can live to a certain extent in a tribe that will protect you while you focus on building your wealth.\n\nSmile when you are tired at work. Be thankful for the hard times. Save every penny. Do this and I guarantee you freedom from the traps of finance/\n\nYour soul, how you go on, past survival is the riddle that really gets most of us/ on that note, im still searching.\n\nEnjoy the times when money is the only question in your heart. Once that distraction is dealt with, you have to cope with the guy in the mirror.",

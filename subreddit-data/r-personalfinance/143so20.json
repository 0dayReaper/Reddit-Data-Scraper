    "postText": "I plan on purchasing a house some time next year, ideally summer 2024 since I just renewed my lease and the new lease ends in August 2024. I already have enough for 20% down. So I'm trying to figure out what to do with my future paychecks, and there are essentially 3 options:\n\n1) Put down a larger downpayment (maybe favorable given the high mortgage interest rates? though they might be lower by the time I purchase)\n\n2) My employer offers mega backdoor roth, so I can contribute to an after-tax 401(k) and have it converted into a roth. \n\n3) Put it in an individual brokerage and invest in equities\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\#3 sounds inferior to #2, since with #2, I would invest the roth 401(k) money in a roth and the earnings would grow tax free, so I think it's really a debate between #1 and #2.",

            "comment": "I think this depends on your personal preferences. Which risks are the least palatable? A mortgage in retirement? Money in a tax advantaged account with some or all of advantages taken away by future legislation? Money locked up in a house or retirement accounts that keep you from pursuing a dream?\n\nFor me, this would depend on whether I plan to stay in the house for the rest of my life. If yes, then I would want to pay off the house sooner for the peace of mind that comes with knowing my retirement housing is secure. (At least, moreso than if I had a mortgage. Property taxes can still change. And home maintenance is expensive.) But that's just me. What matters is what's important to you.\n\nIf you just want to maximize returns, then you have to decide which plan will get you that. But I suggest including how you imagine that you'd like your life to go and not optimizing purely for returns because even if you have the willpower to stick to that, you may wonder later if you made the right choice.",

[http://imgur.com/gallery/lPjXhQt](http://imgur.com/gallery/lPjXhQt)\n\nIf you are looking for information on what to do if your bank declines fraud purchases or your bank refuses to return your money, please read this so you can see what steps we had to take to get something done.\n\nI just wanted to post an update to anyone who followed along on my post last Thursday about the issue we were having with Bank of America declining some very obvious fraud charges and giving us the runaround for 180 days. For those not familiar with the situation, you can read up on it in detail here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ac96zf/180\\_days\\_later\\_bank\\_of\\_america\\_is\\_refusing\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ac96zf/180_days_later_bank_of_america_is_refusing_to/)\n\nTLDR: July 15. Fruad on our debit card in Texas while we were in Illinois. 180+ days later, bank lies to my wife after repeated phone calls. I ask for help on reddit. It goes viral. You guys give big help.\n\nAfter posting on Thursday, I took the advice of several Redditors and took the several steps on Friday. Here is the timeline of events leading up to this being closed out.\n\n* **8:00am Friday:** Called  Jonathan Stickland, my local Texas House Representative and left a message explaining the situation\n* **11:00am Friday:** Submitted a complaint to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB - [https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/))\n* **12:00pm Friday:** My wife called me and told me Jonathan Stickland's assistant had called her to gather more information and said she would be making some calls to see what they could do for us.\n* **4:00pm Friday:** Wife called me to let me know that someone from Bank of America's \"Regulatory Complaints Department\" had called her in regards to the CFPB complaint filed earlier in the day. He called at 10 minutes before his office closed and my wife didn't get the message until after. We planned to call Monday morning.\n* **9:00am Saturday:** Wife wakes me up and says the money is back in the account as a \"Misc Credit\"\n* **9:00am Today:** I call CFPB. They say the complaint is still open with the bank and they usually respond within 15 days.\n* **9:00am Today:** I call the number left by BofA's Regulatory Complaints Department. Leave a voicemail. Wife calls him from work and leaves a voice mail\n* **1:00pm Today:** We get a notification from Bank of America that the dispute is closed. We're done. We will wait until the notice comes in the mail before we shut our accounts and move.\n\nI hope that anyone else in our situation now or in the future can use this to get some fast results too.\n\nThanks to everyone who commented with advice, their own stories, and kind words to keep me motivated throughout the process.",

How to find a credit union:\n\n&gt;The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the agency that oversees federal credit unions, provides a [credit union locator](http://www.mycreditunion.gov/)  online. Start by searching within your geographic area, then check  eligibility requirements to see if you can join any nearby credit  unions.^(1)  \n&gt;  \n&gt;If you can\u2019t find a credit union in your neighborhood, search  nationally. It may be possible to find a credit union elsewhere that you  can qualify for (remember you can still use a local credit union\u2019s  branch if they\u2019re part of the [CU Service Center](https://www.thebalance.com/can-i-make-a-deposit-at-any-credit-union-315398) network).\n\n^(1) Try calling any CU you like, many are switching to accepting anyone!  \n\n\nFull article for more in depth research: [https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-find-a-credit-union-315397](https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-find-a-credit-union-315397)\n\n  \nI would also check yelp ratings.  \n",

No  complaints so far, they always honor my online payments and haven't opened any fraudulent accounts in our names yet !  :)",

I didn't actually know they did full banking services until recently, when I had to transfer the address for a renter's policy, and the rep mentioned something about it. \n\nI've used USAA for a few different insurance policies for years, and I've never had a single bad thing I could say about them. Every time I've had to speak to anyone on the phone for anything, they've been super easy and helpful. \n\nFor customer service quality at least, I'd recommend them to everyone. ",

If I had autopay bills come due while is was MIA, they simply wouldn\u2019t get paid.\n\nI absolutely could not get past tier one support despite vigorous efforts over several months. I\u2019d call in and since the tier 1 folks couldn\u2019t see it either, they\u2019d argue with me that I didn\u2019t have a checking account with them.\n\nThen they\u2019d ask me if I was using my phone or a computer to check it.  If I said either one, they\u2019d transfer me to technical support where they\u2019d tell me to \u201cmake sure my app was updated\u201d or \u2018make sure I was using the latest webbrowser\u2019 I even had one sweet, well intentioned tier 1 person ask me where I lived, and when I told her, she replied that it had been cloudy in my part of the country and THAT was interfering with my phone.\n\nI never expressed the blind, incoherent rage that was building, but I absolutely could not get past tier 1 regardless of what I said or did. Toward the end, I thought it might be a firing offense to get me to tier 2.  And it was frightening seeing my checking account randomly pop into and out existence and my own bank arguing with me about it.\n\nI finally searched and carpetbombed as many \u201cexecutive\u201d email addresses as I could find on the Internet, including a couple to the CEO. \n\nI STILL never got to talk anyone who seemed to understand what was happening, and eventually got an email saying the issue had \u201cbeen resolved and shouldn\u2019t recur.\u201d\n\nIt really shattered my faith in the previously solid and service oriented USAA.

There is a limit of $15/month of fees they'll cover, but I typically use an ATM less than once a month so that isn't really a problem.  I love not having to hunt down a specific ATM.  I just walk up to the nearest one, and it is free for me.\n\n* Other banks have kind of caught up now, but for a long time their online deposit was something no one else had (that I knew of).  Before smartphones, they offered online depositing of checks by sticking them on a flatbed scanner on a PC as early as 2006.  They added smartphone camera deposit support in 2009.  Before that, they would mail me a stack of prepaid envelopes, so if I had a check I would just stick it in the free envelope and drop it in the mail.  Because they don't have branches scattered around the country, they've always been very focused and a leader in online/remote services.\n\n* Free checking.  No fees, no minimums.\n\n* They used to be one of the only US banks offering a true chip-and-pin card, which was great for international travelers.  I traveled around Europe, and often had to help other Americans purchase things when I was the only one with a credit card that worked in the kiosks.  However, they dropped this product and replaced the cards of everyone who had it with non chip-and-pin cards.  Not sure why, but it happened when they transitioned from Mastercard to Visa, so I suspect dropping it was a side-effect and not specifically intended.\n\n* Bitcoin friendly.  While some banks are cancelling the accounts of people found transferring money in/out of Bitcoin, USAA has Coinbase integration.  It' s nothing fancy, and just shows my Coinbase balances within USAA's site, but it shows they're not afraid of Bitcoin users.\n\nAnd that's not even getting into their famed customer support...\n\nI see people talking about things like if a bank has branches nearby, and that is meaningless to me.  I think the last time I went into a bank branch was the early '90s.",

For some reason BofA cashed the check, even though there wasn\u2019t enough funds available.  When I filed a stolen check complaint, they did an investigation and said the sig matched previous checks and denied the claim.  Was a huge mess.  Closed my accounts and got a lawyer.  Never got my money back, but didn\u2019t have to pay the over drawn amount or the fees or the lawyer fees.

Dude was pretty wealthy due to an invention and basically checked out; however,  he was a tenured big-name professor. I tried everything - talking to dean, leaving post-it notes on advisors door, etc. I wasn't at some huge university - relatively small.  I got exasperated and emailed the president of the University and cc'd all the people who had not helped along the way.  I had been trying for weeks to get a PIN. Within a half hour of sending the email the situation was resolved.  The dean called me into her office to reprimand me and actually called my father to tell him what I'd done. The latter was a weird strategy because my dad unsurprisingly was irritated with the dean and not me. Anyway my point is it's amazing how high you have to escalate some things before they get resolved - even when they're pretty minor.",

I believe the releases are specific to ( i.e. grades, financials, etc.) I would think this would be a ferpa violation, but I'm not a legal professional, just a college student who is a TA.",

At any research university (basically all state schools, and any private school that doesn't specifically bill itself as 'liberal arts' or 'undergraduate institution'), the faculty positions are NOT teaching positions. They're research positions that sometimes also require teaching. All of the faculty were evaluated and hired based on their research potential, with teaching getting much less consideration. Many faculty embrace the dual roles, but for a significant minority, if you're talking to them about teaching, registration, forms, whatever that isn't research, you're already bothering them with something that they'd rather not be doing.\n\nAdd on top of that that the academic market has a kind of 'rockstar' feel to it. There aren't enough tenure-track academic positions for everyone who wants one to get one. In fact, there aren't enough by a longshot. So the people who do get these jobs, even at what might otherwise be considered mid-level state schools, typically did their PhD at highly ranked universities, had prestigious postdocs, and beat out like 100 other candidates for the job. \n\nI think that kind of highly competitive process does some selecting for people who thrive on that attention, have very high self-confidence (bordering on arrogance), etc. ",

The first step was meeting with my professor and presenting why I thought I shouldn't have got an F in the class. I referenced the syllabus where it clearly outlined the grade breakdown but of course he didn't want to listen.\n\nThe second step was going to the dean of my major. We scheduled a meeting and I spend all night preparing a portfolio of class materials, grades, reports, and documents to support my side of the argument. I show up to his office at the scheduled time, introduce myself, and start bringing up the topics of my appeal, but immediately it feels like I'm in the same chair many other desperate students were sitting in. He seems unconcerned and glosses over the documents as I hand them to him, almost as if he's already decided. I burn through my prepared speech faster than expected. When it's his turn to talk he irrelevantly brings up the grade appeal process and almost like a script he says the next step will be meeting the grade committee. I try to ask him questions, if he even approves or denies my appeal because I need that to progress, but he keeps vaguely answering \"Trust the process.\" He talks a lot but doesn't say much. \"Trust the process.\"\n\nSo I went to the grade committee. And after writing up a 12 page report you know what they said? They said that my department dean has to send a signed form approving or denying my appeal before they'll even read it.\n\nAt this point I was tired of the bullshit so I CC'ed everyone in an email and attached the form. I included an advisor, head of the grade committee, department dean, and my professor and told them that the grade committee requested the report be signed with their approval or denial of my appeal.\n\nIt set off bombs. Half a day goes by and the department dean says he will meet with the professor. The next morning he says the professor will handle the rest of the appeal. The professor sends an appointment to meet. He said he will regrade my project due to the points I brought up in the syllabus. Two days go by and I check my grade, to my surprise my F was changed into an A. I graduate cum laude.",

Regulatory complaints team tries to call you to let you know.\n5.

They even took away the reward points that had accrued, because God forbid they do something to make up for their constant hassle.

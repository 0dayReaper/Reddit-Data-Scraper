    "postText": "I'm currently in Qatar but my assigments might bring me to UAE, Asia, SEA and Europe again. Qatar is tax free and we will be prioritizing countries with no to low taxes. I don't see myself buying a house or appartment due to the uncertainty of the destination. We might retire in 20 years from now either in SEA or Europe. We have family in both places and a high chance of inheriting a house in both places. We saved up money beyond an emergency fund and we have no kids to plan for.\n\nI thought of passive investing into index funds as one investment strategy. If I do that I dont want to have to pull out the money if I move countries. \n\nI have a bank account in Germany, but Germany has incredibly high taxes. \n\nI have used the etorro app before but I suppose that's not a great place to store money for 20 years.",

If I do that I dont want to have to pull out the money if I move countries. \n\nAs a non-resident of the US - you CAN invest in US index funds or the market through brokerage accounts. Note that many brokerages don't encourage overseas investors because of the documentation / formalities to be completed. Two possible brokers you can look at; Interactive Brokers has a wide range of markets they cover and foreign investors that they will service; Charles Schwab has an international brokerage service that requires a minimum of $25K.\n\nNote that as a non-resident of the US : You will have to submit documentation (personal ID's and other); File a W8-BEN and periodically update it to certify that you are non-resident; and a variety of other formalities. Non residents are exempt from capital gains but are subject to 30% tax withholding on passive income (dividends and interest) - so you do need to choose your investments for growth and not for income.\n\nAs long as you don't become a US resident - you don't have to worry about pulling out your money when you move places. That said - each country has different tax laws, many of them don't tax overseas income - but you need to make sure before you move there and if necessary either pull it out or be prepared to wait for the next move OR pay the tax in the local country as appropriate.\n\n&gt; We might retire in 20 years from now either in SEA or Europe. We have family in both places and a high chance of inheriting a house in both places. \n\nI hear you on the not wanting to buy property in Germany because of taxes - but if you do have family in SEA (who can help with managing / supervising the property) - that MAY be an option worth exploring. Some countries allow overseas buyers; others don't; you can check what applies in your specific case, and whether it would be worthwhile to invest in property (rental or commercial or other).",

Note that many of the countries that have tax treaties with the US also have taxes on income; some tax only local income, some may tax foreign investment income etc.\n\nThat said - with a investment strategy focused on growth (and not income) and with capital gains not being taxed by the US for a non-resident - you are likely to retain most if not all of your returns. You will need to review your strategy before any move to ensure you don't get taxed on past earnings.",

Right now my strategy is to be not registered in Germany and not have an income due to the high taxation. At this stage it's not in the plan that I will use a property in Germany. My proffesional field is underpaid and tax is high in Germany. Working abroad makes more sense for us.",

In the majority of the world i.e., not USA and Eritrea, people are taxed on foreign income only if they are residents (reside in the country for 183 days in a year). If you are a non-resident and receive your income not from your home country, you are not taxed on it. Therefore, it may be financially practical to establish a residency in a tax-free country, open an investment account there and invest money in REITs, not purchasing a real estate in your country of citizenship.\n\nSecond: it is hard to be a landlord from abroad. Any problem and you're responsible for it. Imagine you have a subletting renter, a fentanyl lab, or a human trafficking going on your premises, and you simply can't jump a plane on a short notice and return to solve the matter. You need to either have a local representative with POA, or an intermediary who will rent it out and clear all hassles for you for a price which may erode all the alpha.",

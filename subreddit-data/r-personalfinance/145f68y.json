    "postText": "Title pretty much says it all. In addition to me and my partner\u2019s retirement accounts and taxable brokerages, I have ~5k invested in random stocks. I\u2019m talking a little of everything, largely just because I was interested in researching stocks and their potential. I\u2019m not day trader and all my other investments are on auto pilot, but it was just a bit of a hobby during 2020. \n\nThose investments are up ~30% as a whole,  but with some real duds in there. \n\nPartner thinks I should just hold them and not realize the losses of the duds that never rebounded, and just leave them there indefinitely (maybe forever lol). I was thinking to sell them and throw the money into index funds, which works better for my \u201cset it and forget it\u201d mentality and also might perform better over time. Just wondering what those who may be more active investors and/or more well-versed on the pros/cons think. \n\nIn case the context helps for tax repercussions or anything, we are married and file jointly. \n\nTIA!",

            "comment": "The only real con is taxes. You could at least sell the duds you no longer want to hold and enough of the winners to offset the capital gains to $0. Then for the rest you can let them sit until you have other losses to harvest or decide the amount of tax you pay is worth it for simplifying your investments going forward.",

    "postText": "My kid will be going overseas for school, we will keep her car and use ourselves (car is in our name, but insurance is under childs name) as you know insurance for a teen (southwest USA) is not cheap. Can our kid be not on the policy while she is away? seems silly to pay all that money for nothing. I am not well versed in insurance so I assume taking child OFF the policy, then putting child back on when child returns is possible?\n\nAny help would be great.",

Since the child's DL will still show your home address, you will need to show proof that the child no longer lives here (overseas school admission letter or student certification).\n\nThe disadvantages : \n\nIf the child comes back during vacations etc; they can't drive your cars.\n\nWhen they come back for good - they will be considered as \"not having had insurance\" and therefore will be charged higher rates.\n\nSecond option : Many insurance companies offer \"distant student discount\"; my insurance considers 100 miles as the distance. You submit proof of study, and they give a discount.\n\nIn my case - the distant student discount was close to the exclusion discount (about $100 more per year); I chose the distant student discount instead of the exclusion discount.\n\nAdvantage : Price slightly higher, but allows child to drive when comes back for vacations; and in the future, their insurance costs will be a lot lower.",

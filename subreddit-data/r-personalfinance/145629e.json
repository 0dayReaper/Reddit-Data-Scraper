            "comment": "If your employer has any matching on 401k, be sure to max that out. And then look for low cost index funds in the 401k. If your options are not good in the 401k, look into rolling it over into a self directed IRA. \n\nFor the $20,000 in your checking it all depends what your goals are. Check the wiki. You want to fund an emergency fund for starters.  Then you may want to save for a vehicle, house down payment, travel or simply invest. For investing: a brokerage account with low or no fees like Vanguard or TD Ameritrade is a good option. Don\u2019t buy individual stocks, buy low cost index funds like VTI. \n\nA High Yield Savings account or treasury bonds are options so that your money isn\u2019t losing massive value to inflation.  \n\nRoth IRA or standard IRA are options if you decide to put some of the money for retirement.",

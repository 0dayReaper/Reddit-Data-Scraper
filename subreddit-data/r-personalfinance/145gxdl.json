Now they are pursuing investments, and they claim they will pay my salaries once they secure investment.\n\nShould I take any action? If so, what should I do?\n\nThe startup is in Europe and I have been working remotely from outside of Europe.",

So OP would need to look into the labor laws of his own country.\n\nIndeed many EU countries wouldn't allow this behaviour. I.e. my country would require a permit to fire someone (even due to economic reasons, though a bankruptcy would be without it), latefees are due on late income &amp; the state will cover up to 3 months of late pay incase of bankruptcy &amp; the state being notified in time by employees about non payment.",

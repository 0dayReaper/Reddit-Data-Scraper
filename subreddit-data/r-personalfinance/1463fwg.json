We would like to transfer it in my name as they are getting older and my credit is much better now.\nHow do we go about this? The house in under an LLC if that makes a difference.",

I did this with my dad's commercial property - it cost like $200. The attorney will have to figure out the LLC. Not sure why they did that, seems unnecessary.",

Only way to put the mortgage out of their names is for you to finance and purchase the house from them. It\u2019s possible the mortgage could be assignable but that\u2019s unlikely. Since their mortgage has the house as collateral if you can\u2019t assume it then you\u2019re just buying the house from them with your own financing.",

    "postText": "I'm considering buying a condo as an investment property, and would appreciate tapping into this arena's Wisdom of Crowds. \r  \n\r  \n**Case facts:** \r  \n *- Mid 40s, married, 2 middle school age children*\r  \n *- NW around $1mm*\r  \n *- MHCOL area*\r  \n *- HHI has been between $200k and $300k the past several years*\r  \n *- Primary residence worth around $900k, $350k remains on mortgage, just under 4% interest*\r  \n *- 401k and 529s are in reasonable shape* \r  \n\r  \nI have around $175k in liquid investments, with another $100k bump forthcoming. My impulse (and the idea I'm floating here) is to purchase a 2BR or 3BR condo in the immediate vicinity for $300k to $350k as a rental. \r  \n\r  \nThe area I'm targeting is within an affluent inner suburb with an exemplary school system. The aim is to pay nearly all cash, with the monthly carrying cost from minimal financing at 7% interest, property tax, insurance, and HOA totaling around $2k a month. Expected rent would be in the $2,300 / month vicinity, so my expectation is to build equity, not achieve significant immediate cashflow. \r  \n\r  \nWith prices flagging a bit and rates contextually high, this seems like an opportune time to leverage cash on hand while creating future upside once rates cool off. \r  \n\r  \nThe counterargument against buying a specific property would be just to plow the money into a REIT, but I'm thinking there is some advantage or efficiency to purchasing a property outright (or nearly so) that a retail investor with $25k or $50k would not be able to gain. \r  \n\r  \nThanks for participating in this thought experiment, views and reactions welcome!",

    "postText": "I know this may seem like a bragging post, but it\u2019s not. I make very good money, more than all of my friends and I work remote. Live in a medium cost of living area. Have no debt. $150K in savings.\n\nI make around $275K including bonus, equity etc. my base salary is $200K. I also have a partner who we split expenses proportionate to our income.\n\nMy previous job I was making around $100K. We were living great then. And I was still saving a lot. \n\nNow I\u2019m still saving a ton but every-time I buy something to treat myself I feel guilty. I usually only buy a few big things a year. This year I got a good bonus and decided to treat us to a nice chair that I\u2019ve wanted all my life (it was around 5K.) even though this is the first time I\u2019ve treated myself since starting this job I still feel guilty. \n\nWhen I hang out with friends who work tirelessly at their jobs and barely make means, I feel guilty. Most of my friends have no idea what I make and I try not to bring up anything money related in front of them. \n\nHow do I stop feeling guilty about living the life I\u2019ve worked hard for?",

Once you\u2019ve done it enough you\u2019ll notice you feel it less. That\u2019s how our brain is wired. \n\nObviously, you can take this too far. But that\u2019s the real answer to your question.",

            "comment": "I struggle with this, too, because I 1) was raised by very frugal parents and 2) have experienced being \"broke.\" These days, I live by two rules: 1) If I can't pay cash for it, I don't buy it and 2) if I CAN pay cash for it, but doing so would mean dipping into my emergency fund, not making my full retirement contributions, or not paying my bills, I don't buy it. This helps me rationalize my spending; if all my financial obligations have been met and I have surplus cash to make a purchase, I don't feel bad about it because I'm following my own rules.",

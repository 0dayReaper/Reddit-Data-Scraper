    "postText": "Hello, not sure if this is the proper place to ask but I thought it worth a shot. \n\nI received an adverse action notice and it came with a $1,100 check. It\u2019s from a local property specialist. I\u2019m not sure what this is or why I received it. I googled it and from my understanding you get it after putting in applications for various things. But I haven\u2019t applied for anything. I am currently renting. I have been in this house for 2 years, always make my payments on time, and I don\u2019t rent thru them. I\u2019m sorry if I am completely misunderstanding or misinformed. \nI\u2019m just unsure what to do. I don\u2019t know what this is for, and why it came with a check. any advice is appreciated thanks guys\n\n\u2014\n\nit\u2019s not letting me edit but another thing I wanted to add that\u2019s stressing me, is my name is not on any of the paperwork. Is this normal? It has my address and thats it. It\u2019s also marked as info received from criminal record but I have no record.",

But no name is listed as the person it\u2019s for. The only name it includes is the company name and the signature from whoever completed the action. \nOtherwise it wasn\u2019t addressed to any person. But most importantly I don\u2019t want this money ?? I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re freaking out. I don\u2019t accept any checks that I wasn\u2019t fully aware I was receiving. And had no idea this thing contained a check until I was opening my mail. Again, it wasn\u2019t addressed to anyone in particular, you\u2019re just being an ahole for no good reason lol.",

The fact there was additional information and a check inside makes this worse, not better.  Op\u2019s best bet is to contact the company that sent it and have them fix the issue\u2026shredding it or setting fire to it would compound the issue as well.

    "postText": "While browsing on my phone last night, I came across [this ad](https://imgur.com/a/d4ISK) recommending holding real gold and silver in a self directed IRA account.  Please do not follow this advice.  It's horrible and Reddit should be ashamed of selling this type of advertising to their users.\n\nEdit:  I want to thank the r/personalfinance moderator /u/dequeued and Reddit admin u/liltrixxy for their quick attention and response in [resolving this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/62141f/reddit_is_advertising_really_bad_ira_advice/dfj7i8k/) \n\nEdit 2:  I know I spelled ads wrong in the title.  I, like most people, fall for common [homonyms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZLkcFns8Ks) when typing fast and posting without proofing.  \n\nEdit 3:  Thank you reddit for correcting my grammar because it does matter.\n\nEdit 4:  I do use an ad blocker but this is on the reddit app on my phone.  \n\nEdit 5: [See this thread for why it's a bad idea to hold physical gold and/or silver in a self directed IRA.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/62141f/reddit_is_advertising_really_bad_ira_advice/dfiwa9g/)  tl;dr:  Placing a physical commodity inside a tax advantaged account is pointless because it doesn't produce earnings, it sits.  Self directed IRAs open you up to fraud.  Fees you have to pay a special custodian.  Cost of storage.  When RMD hits, your stash of gold will be valued and your RMDs will be based off that valuation and physical gold will start being sold off to meet the RMD regardless of what they can sell for and with disregard to future valuation.  Lack of diversification.  High volatility, etc.  [See u/SIave's comment about the difference in earning between physical gold and the stock market](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/62141f/reddit_is_advertising_really_bad_ira_advice/dfiytwk/) and [/u/benny_kurrell's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/62141f/reddit_is_advertising_really_bad_ira_advice/dfjh0dz/?context=3).",

Those people might have specifically bought an ad on /r/personalfinance, so then it'd be quite difficult to exclude the subreddit from showing it. It's still nice of you to contact the admins though.

Precious metals don't actually produce value, they tend to go up and down based on inflation and other market factors, not because they produce new additional value themselves.

One is a commodity, the other is an entire industry that people depend on. I don't know why you even thought of real estate to prove your point.

There's a sweet spot in the supply curve where a commodity can be used as a currency: it must be rare enough to be valuable but common enough to be generally available at the level of demand. With the vast majority of modern gold production going into government/bank purchases of 1KG or 12.5KG bars, while population continues to increase, gold coins probably don't exist in adequate supply to properly lubricate an economy.",

I'm not sure that shiny rock stockpile is going to do any good.\n\nSo long term you can count on riding out a crash with a properly diversified portfolio, but lets say you were set to retire in 2007/2008 when the market collapsed. Within two years half of that value evaporated. That value returned **eventually** but the market didn't cross it's high water mark again until 2013 at which point retirees living off those investments were stuck cashing out at half value for most of 6 years. Gold as a commodity however tripled in value over that same timespan from $600/oz to over $1800 (currently it's sitting about $1200).\n\nWhen most sensible people say to buy some gold they don't mean your entire portfolio, but a modest amount as part of a diversification strategy to hedge against a recession, because when the market crashes commodities like Gold/Silver surge in value.\n\nSelling what's $50,000 of gold in a normal year for $100k during a collapse beats the shit out of selling $200k of investments for the same liquidity.",

Gold will not have earnings and it will never give something like dividends.  Commodities like gold fluctuate wildly in price.  While you had to purchase physical gold at market price, your sale of it will be less than market.  You're also wasting tax deferred space on something that doesn't generate income.  When you reach required minimum distribution age gold will be sold of regardless of its value to start payments.  Let's not forget the fees you'll pay a special custodian because places like vanguard and schwab will not touch this.  You also need to pay for storage space.  The list continues...\n\nEdit: fidelity sell physical gold for ira's so removed them from the list.",

A Self Directed IRA is one of the best retirement options available (second only to HSA accounts and Solo 401(k) accounts).  There's nothing wrong with as SD-IRA in general, they're actually a very good idea for smart investors.  \n\nThere is risk if you have no idea what your doing (and you use it entirely to buy gold for example).",

The idea is on some imaginary absolute value scale it will remain constant. 1 ounce of gold today = 1 month rent, 1 ounce gold in 100 years = 1 month rent.  However, if you are owning gold as a hedge against inflation the value in terms of dollars could increase significantly resulting in big tax bills. \n",

To take an extreme example, while a dollar invested in bonds in 1801 would be worth nearly a thousand dollars by 1998, a dollar invested in stocks that same year would be worth more than half a million dollars.  All this is in real terms, taking\ninflation into account.  Meanwhile, a dollar invested in gold in 1801 would by 1998, be worth just 78 cents. The phrase, \u201cas good as gold\u201d can be misleading as the phrase \u201cmoney in the bank\u201d, when talking about the long run.  \n\n&gt;There have been many short-run periods when bonds and gold held their value while stock prices plummeted.  The relative safety of these different kinds of investments varies greatly with how long a time period you have in mind.",

Unfortunately, one of the mods went along with it and decided to finger-wag at Reddit, too...\n\nThe more cautious claims OP could have made, but didn't, are 1) that holding precious metals may not be for everyone, and it requires careful research about its downsides and upsides, and 2) self-directed IRAs are complicated and should be approached with caution and care.\n\nAnd a slight correction, because OP mistakenly claimed down-thread that Fidelity won't touch the stuff, Fidelity offers precious metals holdings in IRAs:\nhttps://www.fidelity.com/trading/investment-choices/gold-silver-platinum",

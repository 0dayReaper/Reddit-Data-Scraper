I mean sending a personnel to the place (japan in my case)to investigate? 20 days for the whole investigation seem too fast",

I think they actually do some type of internal investigation to make sure that the fraud is legit.\n\nI know of people who have had charges reversed, and they were really lying about it, so they got the charges put back onto their account",

This is from cars and apartment debt and other small debts. \n\nI current make around $40,000 a year before taxes. \n\nI\u2019m 24M. \n\nI talked to a bankruptcy lawyer, he said he would help me with with process for $1,500. There\u2019s other courts fees and miscellaneous things that need to be done. So in total about $2,075. \n\nI would like to hear your thoughts on if you think I\u2019m making the right decision, if there are other options, and is this a fair amount he is charging to file. \n\nThanks for all your replies.\n\nMy only asset is a video game console",

If you quit spending money on lottery tickets by the end of the year you will have the money to pay the lawyer fees.  I read $160/month on lottery.  Of course if you do pay the attorney and file bankruptcy most of your monthly debt expense goes away.  \n\nIt will be about seven to ten years before you can get your credit restored.  That\u2019s seven to ten years of always paying more for car insurance and more for credit.  Good luck being able to buy a house without a co-signer.  \n\nIf you file bankruptcy keep in mind it\u2019s not a silver bullet.  You\u2019ll likely come out ahead with your debts being discharged.  However you will still pay more for things until your credit is fixed.  You could pay part of this off and in about two years have an okay credit score.  I probably would file for bankruptcy.  Simply because the cash flow will be more positive than negative in the near term.  However if you don\u2019t control your spending the bankruptcy will have been for nothing.  Just another $2,000 thrown away.",

    "postText": "I just found out that my insurance plan isn\u2019t compatible with a normal FSA, only HSA. \n\nSo I unknowingly put $1,000 into a limited purpose FSA with no significant dental or vision expenses in the foreseeable future. \n\nAnything I can do here to recoup these expenses? My employer is saying I can\u2019t withdrawal the funds or transfer them to a normal FSA or HSA. \n\nI\u2019d really hate to lose the $1,000. It sounds like the end of year rollover is pretty minimal. Any suggestions? I have tons of medical expenses that I could really use this money for.",

            "comment": "While expensive, I do hope you at least learned the lesson to read / ask about what you sign up for.  If it's any consolation, since FSA deductions are pre-tax (including social security / medicare), in terms of spendable take-home pay this $1000 really only represents a loss of $800 or so (difference would've gone to taxes), though will depend on your overall federal + state tax situation.\n\nA limited purpose FSA is specifically only for dental and vision expenses.  This makes it compatible with an HSA since no medical costs are covered, but is only useful if you actually expect to **have** dental/vision expenses that you'd use that FSA money on.  And vision/dental plans commonly cover most basic needs (annual eye exam, two dental cleanings) anyway without the need for paying much beyond that.\n\nDo you wear contacts / glasses?  Getting replacements would be one way to use up some of that money.  LASIK (or other eye repair surgery) is typically another qualified expense, but that's going to run you more than $1000.  [This page](https://healthequity.com/lpfsa-qme) appears to have a list of expenses eligible for a LPFSA, though your particular FSA may have a different list.  Some of those might apply to your situation.",

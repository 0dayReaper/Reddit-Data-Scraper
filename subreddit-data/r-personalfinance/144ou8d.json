I\u2019ve had a credit card for 3ish years? Never missed a payment or anything like that and my credit score is like 770. I am a college student so my income is a little low. \n\nIn the past I was looking at the cash back and the quicksilver 2% cash back card came to mind. I applied like a year and a half ago and was rejected because I put my real income down\u2026. Which was too low to qualify unfortunately. I\u2019ve been told I should just lie about my income because they don\u2019t check but I feel uneasy doing that. I don\u2019t intend to max out a 20k limit or something just put a charge or 2 on it every now and then and grow a history with another line of credit. \n\nWhat cards of choice would y\u2019all recommend getting or ones that you use frequently. I do expect to travel more frequently in the future as I do triathlons so I\u2019ve been looking at like the chase sapphire I believe it\u2019s called? I\u2019m not trying to churn card benefits or whatever although any bonuses are nice. I also want something from a reputable company/loan agency. \n\nThanks in advance for the advice. Any links or resources you have I will gladly look at so feel free to leave the links!",

I guess right now I\u2019m looking for\u2026 well the bulk of my expenses outside of like daily necessities is going to be from triathlon\u2026 so training equipment, fuel stuff, travel, and race fees. I\u2019ve got 3 races planned for later this year in Wisconsin, Arizona, and Florida for their 70.3s. Crunching the flight numbers that\u2019s like 1200 bucks on flights alone not including equipment stuff I\u2019d have to bring. So 3% cash back there wouldn\u2019t be awful. Especially since this is something I\u2019ll do more in the future. \n\n1. Travel likely first.\n2. Maybe a basic needs card? I\u2019ve heard of some that do big cash back on like groceries or restaurants. (Discover is nice but it\u2019s a rotating 5% category)",

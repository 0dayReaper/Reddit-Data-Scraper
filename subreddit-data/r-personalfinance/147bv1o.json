    "postText": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI am 20 with plenty of savings, and a good job I have been at for 2+ years and recently got a raise to $30/hr which is insane for my age and I am super grateful for what I have accomplished. I drive a 2011 Kia that keeps giving me nothing but trouble, and I've had my window smashed in twice which is becoming a common occurrence against the vehicle. I currently live with my folks and pay them $450/month in rent which is great but I am looking to go out on my own soon.\n\nI went to a dealer this weekend and found a brand new VW Taos for a great deal under MSRP due to the dealer closing, my OTD price is only $28,500 (MSRP is $33k). I was planning to put $10k down (a big chunk of which will be reimbursed when I sell my Kia), my payment will be at or under $350/month. I would love to take the advice to just buy used, but I am honestly incredibly tired of having an unreliable, un-warrantied vehicle and this savings opportunity seems too good to pass up (I would be all in well under KBB value).\n\nWould it be a responsible purchase?",

It will depreciate quicker than a Corolla or Civic as well. \n\nGet a  Toyota Corolla (regular one, not the crossover) or a Honda Civic, lower spec with not many options. Crossovers are more expensive and the cheap ones aren\u2019t very capable anyway.  You can still get a Sedan for 25k or less new if you look carefully.",

            "comment": "Do not buy the new Taos. Getting it at a discount does not mean it is a savings opportunity.\n\nLike you said, you are making good money for a 20 y/o. Don\u2019t incinerate it by financing a depreciating asset, especially with current interest rates.\n\n Shop used cars among brands with good reliability and get something ~5 years old. You\u2019ll easily be able to find something that is a major upgrade over your current car for $12k or less.\n\nEdit: Just googled VW Taos prices and they start at MSRP of $24k. DO NOT pay $28k for one that has slightly upgraded features.",

Doesn\u2019t seem like the window smashing is going to stop because you get a new car - I\u2019d bet it would actually increases in frequency with a new car.\n\nTo me, spending nearly 1/2 your yearly pre-tax salary on a new car isn\u2019t super responsible and is a bad idea in the long run. But if you have made your budget, taken the increased insurance costs into account, this won\u2019t have a negative impact on your retirement and savings, you\u2019ll still have your 3-6 months EF, and you\u2019re not planning any major lifestyle changes, then it could work. Those stories are just a little rarer.",

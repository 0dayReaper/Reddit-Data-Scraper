Many will ask you to show them your utility bill, and there have been reports of companies signing up you up for their services without your consent after copying down your customer number off of your bill.  Even if they don't, many will end up charging you higher rates than what you're currently paying or will charge you hefty fees to have service with their company.  The first time I fell for one of these, the gas supplier told me that I could lock in a fixed rate to avoid the variable pricing that my gas company uses.  What they neglected to tell me is that their fixed rate was triple the highest that my rate had ever been.\n\nNever sign up for a door to door energy salesman.  Do your own research and find a supplier that offers a low rate (I always suggest a fixed rate with a term of at least 6 months) with no signup fee, no monthly fee, and no early termination fee.  Some states will provide this information for you on a website that lets you compare all of the suppliers side by side, in other states, you might need to do a bit more legwork to find your suppliers and what they charge.",

In the late 1970\u2019s, the federal government determined that energy utilities (which are a natural monopoly) would do better with increased competition.  But because they ARE natural utilities, the market was not opened entirely.  Instead, energy DELIVERY would remain a regulated geographic utility, but energy GENERATION and SUPPLY would be a competitive marketplace open to all players.  However, a single company could not be in both the generation AND transmission businesses (with some exceptions).  Later, most states adopted a system whereby any customer could contract  with any Energy Supply Company (ESCO) for their energy, which the utility would deliver on the common infrastructure.  The local utility would also bill all customers in their service territory and pass the supply cost collected to the ESCO for each customer.\n  \nIt is NOT more efficient on the basis of supplying energy to any particular customer.  The theory is that the competition should deliver overall lower cost to the market as a whole, which will be the best outcome for the most customers.\n\nThe ESCOs make their money either by hedging supply costs or by offering something (like the promise of green sourcing) that makes their profit margin justifiable.\n\nThe utilities make their money on delivery charges, which pay for the improvement and maintenance of the delivery system plus a regulated profit margin.  That margin is set by the state regulators.  This is why the utilities have to get their rate increases approved by the regulators\u2014they have to justify every penny they spend, because every penny winds up on somebody\u2019s bill (with some complicated exceptions).",

If you are in a state where energy is deregulated and you have multiple options for a provider, then the answer is a solid maybe.\n\nThere are absolutely, 1,000,000% certain companies that will exploit you and give you a low rate and then hike up the rates soon after. I\u2019ve seen some people whose rates quadrupled and rather than spending something like 7 cents per kilowatt hour they were now paying like 26. Coincidentally these rates go up right around summer time and winter time when people start using their AC or heater more. If they are only offering an adjustable rate then you should never, never, never sign it. There is about a 99.9% chance of you getting screwed over. If they are offering a fixed rate that will never change then it is likely a good company just trying to save you some money. Often times you can just go online and compare rates and pick the cheapest as long as it\u2019s a fixed rate, this will save you even more money because the reality is no matter who you work with, they are obviously making a profit. What happens is they find out what rate you currently pay (so they probably asked to see your energy bill), and what rates are available in your area, then they add on a few cents per kWh to make a profit, but still give you a cheaper rate than what you currently pay, so in the end everyone comes out on top. What makes it cheaper to do yourself is you can sometimes get those rates before the extra cents are added on since there is no salesman trying get that commission out of you. The key difference here being whether or not they are making a profit by exploiting you or by helping you, which is basically whether they are using an adjustable rate or a fixed rate as a very, very good rule of thumb. I would recommend going online and seeing if you can do it yourself.\n\nI will mention something worth noting is that almost everybody that has not gone through the process of picking their provider is almost guaranteed to be overpaying, and probably by quite a bit. It was very common for me to be able to cut peoples bills in half, and I worked specifically with large businesses so we\u2019re talking millions of dollars of savings just by going through a 10 minute process. I don\u2019t fault you for thinking it\u2019s a scam, it very well could be, but it\u2019s always worth investigating because of the massive savings you might be able to find.\n\nIn order of what\u2019s best I would say (1) research and choose yourself, (2) an unbiased third party consultant that can easily compare rates and give you the best deal [this is far quicker and easier than yourself, but they will add on a few cents as commission, but you also minimize risk by not choosing a company that will scam you], (3) directly with the company [they will add on even more money and be biased toward you working with them even if a cheaper option exists at another company] though still probably cheaper than what you pay, however these are also the ones that could \u201cscam\u201d you by charging crazy fees or using adjustable rates and skyrocketing the prices later (4) a door to door salesman [probably a scam]. If you want you could probably cheat the system by calling a third party company and asking for the company they would pick for you, this will likely be the cheapest option, then go through the company they picked directly yourself online and compare that rate to what was offered to you by them (I say this because sometimes deals are offered to these consulting firms and they actually get you cheaper rates than you could ever get yourself since they bring in so much extra business). \n\nThe major point is just ensuring it is a fixed rate and not an adjustable rate, and one that doesn\u2019t have a ludicrous amount of fees making it end up being more expensive for a cheaper rate, and of course one that is cheaper than what you currently pay. It\u2019ll likely be a 3 year contract and is super easy to get done. It\u2019s also worth noting that during the summer and winter months it\u2019s usually a bad time to get it done because the rates are higher due to the higher usage of everyone in that area. If you are able to get it done at a good time you could end up paying a very low rate for the next several summers and winters rather than being at the mercy of random price changes throughout the years.",

I got a commission from every sale with the lingering promise of a promotion that no one ever got while walking 10+ miles in the cold every day. No base pay. Horrible culture. Had me working alone in random neighborhoods to train people, one turned out to be a pedophile. I was a barely 18 year old girl at the time. \n\nCompany is called smart circle if you want to google them.",

Do not give them your account information or show them your bill or sign anything they give you. They will \"slam\" you which is a nice way to say that they fraudulently change your provider then play dumb in court. You get a teaser rate, followed by crazy high bills a few months or a year later.",

That. Low price for a while, very high price after.\n\n\nMy pitch would always undercut their current rate. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re paying $0.35 for x amount of gas, we would come in and say \u201cbecause Maryland is a state where you can choose your own utility supplier, you can shop around the market for better rates. We\u2019ll sell you gas for $0.23 for the same amount, and lock you in at that rate for two years\u201d\n\nThis is completely true. It\u2019s like insurance, or cell phone carriers, dealing with utilities in some states. You can find better rates, but most of the companies going below market rate are doing it for that scam, because they can put it in a lengthy contract that says after 2 years your rate goes up to $0.74 for that same amount of gas. When you get your utilities from the state or from a well reputed supplier, you get more stable pricing.\n\nBecause most gas bills can be pretty cheap, some people will go years paying double or triple without ever realizing it.",

            "comment": "Yes and no. The top comment I see sums it up fairly well -- but I actually did this door to door work for some time about 5 years ago. What we are doing is essentially switching your energy provider from the government controlled and subsidized one to a private entity due to legislation ruling the previous company a monpoly and allowing more companies to now enter the market. All they are is another front who \"provides a competitive rate for energy sources\" also we had a thing where if you paid a premium we could guarantee you were only recieving \"clean, green\" energy.   \n\n\nIt worked well for our pitch as I was working in Providence, RI and anyone in that area knows there are a ton of wind turbines on the south providence coast line so we could literally be knocking door to door and point to them \"you see those turbines? we can guarantee 100% of your power only comes from that so you are not supporting \"dirty, environmentally damaging\" energy. Was this true? beats me -- we def charged more if they signed up for this though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit was ultimately a pyramid scheme. I had an \"office manager\" who recruited the guy who recruited me. It wasnt until my recruiter became office manager and brought me up to speed on the REAL game which is recruiting suckers to go door to door for you. When I was brought on intially as a door knocker -- we were getting 25-35 per house signed up if we got them on tier 1 or teir 2 respectively.....what I found out once I became a recruiter was that usually a single home would generate over $150 to be paid out, but 45% right off the top went to the office manager's unseen manager, then by the time it got to us recruiters, I was assinged a total of $65 per home. I was generous and gave my sellers $35 per home, and I would get $30 for every house they signed up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNobody likes to work for others without seeing the money up front, and we had to typically wait AT LEAST 3 weeks after selling a home as the energy company red tape and stuff took a few weeks to change everything, and we didnt get paid until the first bill was paid by the person we sold to. It was good money for about 2-3 months and then suddenly my whole sales team quit and I just said its not worth it. I hate selling bull shit",

We had some Verizon leeches out a few weeks ago and they would literally camp out in front of the house for 20+ minutes to see if they could catch you coming outside to talk to you if you didn't answer the door. They came back 5 times over the week. You would think after I didn't answer the first two times you'd give up because it's clear I don't want to talk to you. They suckered a bunch of neighbors to sign up for the new service and to switch from our other provider, but now a few weeks later they are all complaining about billing issues and not getting the services promised etc.",

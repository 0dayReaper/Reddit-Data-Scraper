The biggest exception to this is kinda the other way around -- they're cutoffs for if you received excess advanced premium tax credit (the health care subsidy) how much you need to repay.)\n\n*Edit*: I *will* say though that the EIC phaseout, as well as those for other credits and the phase-in for things like social security taxability, can lead to a *higher marginal rate* than would be suggested by just looking at the normal tax bracket, and potentially much higher. But I doubt it can ever be even particularly close to 100% let alone actually above it. (Aside from the very small steps due to tabularizing the data, same as the actual tax brackets.)",

My point was that while the public assistance cliffs are real, in terms of the tax code *itself* you won't really see them. And indeed, your link shows that the highest additional rate with $2K of additional income across the various income levels is a \"marginal\" rate of 51%. That's high of course, but it's still *way* below 100%, let alone taking home less because you made more.",

Based on how tax brackets actually work al your person has to do is account for the income above a certain level. It seems like people who stress like this don\u2019t fully understand or don\u2019t keep accurate track of their money. If he got pushed into the next bracket because of an extra $100 dollars and that bracket was at 30% then only that hundo is taxed at 30% which means from that hundo he only owes 30 back. Anybody with a 1099 should be using some sort of tracking system for their income and everyone should be budgeting in general.",

A person that makes $21,749 will take home over $300 *more* than a person that makes $21,751.\n\nAnd the people who have to worry about it are already the worst off among us, as they're inherently making around minimum wage.  Now they have to worry about getting as many hours as possible, but they have a ~30 hour window for that year they need to avoid.\n\nhttps://www.tax.ohio.gov/ohio_individual/individual/annual_tax_rates.aspx",

                            "comment": "&gt; Can someone explain to me how automatic tax withholdings are calculated?\n\nThe IRS updated their W4 for the year 2020; it now uses a somewhat different system, though still similar in its broad strokes. Because so many people are using the old ones though, I'll explain the old one based on allowances. This is for non-supplemental pay; supplemental pay is withheld at a flat 22% (unless you're talking like a seven+ figure bonus).\n\nStep 1: annualize the income by multiplying the amount of *that check* only with the number of pay periods in the year. Example: you get a paycheck of $2,000 semimonthly. There are 24 pay periods in the year, so that means an annualized income of $48,000.\n\nStep 2: compute deductions. Multiply the number of allowances you claimed on your W4 by $4,200 (or thereabouts), then add in another $4,000-ish. Also add any pre-tax deductions such as health insurance costs and 401(k) contributions. Example: someone who claimed one allowance and has no other pre-tax deductions would have around $8,200 in assumed deductions.\n\nStep 3: subtract assumed deductions from annualized income. Example: $48,000 minus $8,200 is $39,800.\n\nStep 4: considering the amount from step 3 as your taxable income and without any credits, compute what your tax burden would be using the filing status you indicated on your W4 (either single or married). Example using 2019 numbers on $39.8K is $4,615.\n\nStep 5: divide that tax burden by the number of pay periods per year. That's the amount of federal income tax to withhold. Example: $46,15 divided by 24 is $192 to withhold.\n\nStep 6: withhold state in usually a similar fashion, and \"withhold\" FICA using usually a flat 7.65% of the full amount.\n\nSome of these can be done via table lookup rather than formula, but that's where the table numbers come from.\n\n*Edit*: with the 2020 W4 it's steps 2-4 that change above. Instead of the proxy calculation via allowances, additional income, deductions, and credits are directly reported on your W4. Those are used for the mock tax calculation instead now.",

It's relatively rare that someone can deduct $10,000 in mortgage interest, for example.\n\nIt's in the way that itemized deductions work now.   You have to have more of them to be able to itemize, and fewer things are deductible.  So someone with only $10,000 mortgage interest is relatively more likely to otherwise have relatively low itemized deductions, and so be unable to itemize at all.\n\nTo run some numbers, $10,000 would be 4% of $250,000 principal outstanding.  About 2/3 of mortgages of that size are held by married couples who need to have over $24,000 in itemized deductions to be able to itemize.  They can only claim $10,000 in state (income) and local (property) taxes, so it's hard to see how they would be able to itemize any of that.  \n\nThe numbers are slightly better for single people, who might have (say) $7000 in state and local taxes and then $10,000 in mortgage interest, so could deduct about $5000 of that over the standard deduction.   \n\nParadoxically, if you had $30,000 in mortgage interest on a $750,000 mortgage (the maximum size for full interest deduction), then you almost certainly also have $10,000 in state and local taxes, so could deduct a considerable portion of that, simply because it is more interest.",

We own a home but we cannot write off the interest because we will never meet the itemized amount. Which is fine. Year-over-year we pay $4,700 Less in taxes with the new standard deduction compared to the old tax code. Since we can't write down our mortgage interest we realized that we are basically renting money from the bank and it's not worth it.

Yes, getting a raise resulting in you hitting a higher tax bracket doesn't make your effective tax rate jump to the new tax bracket (only the money that entered the higher tax bracket pays more tax), there is another angle to this.\n\nIn the USA, and I am sure many other countries too, there is such a thing as a assistance(?) cliff. It's where you have various programs helping you in some way (food stamps, rent assistance, subsidized health insurance, scholerships, etc), and they have a hard cutt off. If you are even a penny over, they deny you *all* of the assistance. They do not gradually phase out the assistance, they cut it off entirely.\n\nIt is very possible that if you are currently using those programs and get a raise, you will be much much worse off. This doesn't apply to people in higher incomes because they don't use such programs, hence a ton of posts here flat out ignore this.",

At the micro level, the US and I suspect most if not all states compute taxes (below some threshold anyway, for federal it's $100K) based on a table rather than formulas, and everyone within a $25 or $50 span has the same tax burden. So if you make $1 more and move into the next bucket, your tax will go up by a few dollars. Or phaseouts are often done in $100 increments -- I think the IRA deduction for example works this way, so if you make $1 you might get dropped into the next $100 bucket and lose a $100 deduction (worth, say, $12 or whatever it is for you).\n\nThings like this are usually excluded when people say that a raise won't lead to increased taxes that outweigh the raise. :-)",

I have heard time and time again someone say if they get more $$$ it will bump them into the next tax bracket and they will end up making less in pocket overall.

It's for those kids who grow up to be engineers, physicists, mathematicians, etc. Having those kids succeed into such a career is considered more important by the educational institution is considered more important than teaching something easy to Google for folks like you.",

    "postText": "I've had a fund in my regular savings account at USAA of about 13K -- this is my \"if I lose my job I can still live for a while\" fund. I've wanted to get into an Index Fund for a while now. After reading through several posts here on Reddit, I split this fund into $5K at CIT, $5K at Vanguard, and the remaining $3k I left at USAA. I plan on setting aside $100 biweekly to my USAA, which will then be split $50 to CIT/Vanguard on alternating deposits and the other $50 to remain at USAA until my balance at USAA reaches $5K. Then the $100 biweekly will probably be split 50/50 CIT/Vanguard.\r  \n\r  \nAs I've just opened these accounts, I'm confused on the Vanguard side on what is the Index Fund. I see options for Mutual Fund or ETF, which I think both have Index Funds.\r  \n\r  \nI'm looking for the type where I put my money in, and it follows the market, any dividends earned are invested back into the fund (at my discretion) and I don't have to worry about it every day.\r  \n\r  \nAny help would be appreciated.",

From reading the links you provided it almost seems like the mutual funds VTSAX, VTIAX, VBTLX are preferred.\n\nI'm just still not sure what the difference is except one is traded at the cost at time of transaction and the other is traded at the closing day cost.",

What do you do if you invest this and the market goes down 20% next month and then an emergency comes along, you just lost a lot of money as you can't wait for it to sit and recover.\n\nSo figure out how much you really need in an emergency fund, usually 3-6 months of expenses.  If that is say $10K, then leave that 10K liquid (so high yield savings account, money market, etc.) and take the other 3K and start your investment account with it.\n\nMutual funds are an investment that have multiple stocks in them.  Index fund would be a type of mutual fund and follow a particular stock index.  So an S&amp;P 500 index fund will basically do exactly what the S&amp;P 500 does,  NASDAQ fund will follow that market and so forth.",

The remaining $5K is at Vanguard now in a MF following VTSAX.\n\nSo I still have about $11K liquid at the moment and $5K invested.\n\nI appreciate the advice and you taking the time to reply!",

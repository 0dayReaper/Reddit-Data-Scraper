    "postText": "Due to the sensitive nature of this post, this is a throwaway account.\n\nIncome:\n\n* 92k Salary\n\nCash:\n\n* 60k in savings (15k in first time home buyers savings account, 13k IRA, 32k Roth)\n* 10k in checking (operating/rainy day)\n\nDebt:\n\n* 103k in student loan debt\n* 42k car note\n\nOriginally, I wanted to save up more so i didn't need to use my retirement, but I was informed on the 1st, that my next lease renewal (Dec 2023) will increase by 22% (1850 to 2250). No rental increase laws or caps in my city (Salem, Oregon).\n\nI contacted several lenders and discovered my maximum loan amount is 305k.\n\nThis is an insane amount. I thought it would have no problems finding corner of paradise for my family. It turns out that starter homes, start at 350k, but according my realtor, homes under 400k usually sale within 24 hours. So an obtainable house price is 380-400k. Which is far beyond my means.\n\nMy requirements are:\n\n1. Within a 30 minute drive to work\n2. 3 bedrooms\n3. 2 bathrooms\n4. Not on a busy street or near a highway\n5. Some form of yard\n6. Good condition\n\nAccording my realtor, before COVID these same properties were 140-160k.\n\nI also cant afford the maximum loan of $305k, as thats $2550 a month (pmi, taxes, insurance included).\n\nApartments start at $1800 for a 3BR/2B, 900 SQFT. But this would crush me. I am an extreme introvert.\n\nI cant move far. My wife is blind and relies heavily on my family for support.\n\nI love my job and do not want to switch. But even if i wanted to, i only have four more years before i qualify for my student loans to be forgiven (i work for a nonprofit).\n\nMy parents have zero financial support to offer.\n\nThe only extreme extra that i see is my car. I bought it before the price drop, and incentives. I am 20k in negative equity now. so its sticking with me for the long term. Plus, i really like it. Its the only luxury, that i can see, that is only for me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHere is my financial breakdown: [https://imgur.com/a/JuOoQ4m](https://imgur.com/a/JuOoQ4m)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am completely lost. How are people buying homes? What are they doing i am not?",

Needs to put 20% down, finance for less than 3 years, and the monthly car payment needs to less than 8% gross income (&lt;$613/month for you).  If you can't stick to this rule, you can't afford the car.\n\n-Although your house criteria seem \"reasonable\" to you, your market disagrees.  For house purchase, they recommend 3x your gross income and definitely not more than 4x your gross income (your max should be 368k).  This is so you have enough margin left to save and invest.  They recommend investing 20 to 25% gross income.\n\nLike I said, you can buy a house, but you need to modify what you want.  You need to lower your budget.  Probably won't get the number of beds/baths you want.  Probably won't get a big yard.  Might back into a street.  Remember that whatever you want, other people will want it, too, which causes bidding wars.  Buying a house is not buying a shirt. You have to be able to compete.\n\nSo I bought in 2021 and my advice is pay off all your car/consumer debt, get both credit scores &gt;760, save for at least 10% down, have a 6 months emergency fund.  Don't forget to budget for renovation and moving costs.  Home ownership is very expensive.  It is not something you want to rush into blindly.  I recommend watching The Educated Homebuyer on YouTube and learn as much as you can.

It appears i need more education. Thank you for pointing out where to get that.\n\nSo, should i make extra payments on the car instead of saving for the house? If yes, i could have it payed off in 28-ish months.",

In the mean time, it doesn't hurt to browse Zillow on a weekly basis to see what people are bidding on the price range you want.  Go to YouTube and learn all the house buying terminology.  Reach out to a lender a year prior to buying and have a conversation.  It is all about preparation.  I wish you plenty of luck!!!",

Instead save as much as possible, and put it in a safe investment, like a Money Market account.  They are paying 4.5 pct right now, I think.  If at all possible, save up a 20pct down payment to save on mortgage insurance (when you buy).  Once you have saved up enough, you can talk to a mortgage lender and figure out if you should use the additional funds to pay off the car, or pay a larger down payment for a house.  Either way, you have been collecting interest on the additional saved money.\n\nIn a nutshell, even though you are under water on the car, the car loan you have is almost free money, so paying it off early is questionable.  \n\nI am not a financial advisor.  The above is just a thought you should evaluate for yourself.\n\nGood Luck.",

Quite the contrary, I'm saying this because I'm jealous AF that you are driving the car I want to drive. I just chose the home, first.\n\n1.7% I'd pay that car off as slow as possible and just save up for a larger down payment. As for me, it's the same.

Sometimes Safeway also does a special. We freeze the milk. \nHow do your kids go through 2 gallons a day? \nThere will be a free lunch program once school closes, it\u2019s 0-18 years old. They will be at parks, schools, community centers. In my location the pick up is Monday and then they give an additional lunch for Tuesday and Wednesday with 2 additional lunches for Thur/Fri. \nThere is no income requirement and it\u2019s asked that everyone pick up that has kids to keep the programs funded. This is a nationwide program but they for sure have it in Salem.\n\nHow I shop for groceries is pull up Walmart/Fred meyers, and Safeway app and check the price again reach. I am in rural Oregon on tbe coast so all my stores are next to each other, but I also have to drive an hour one way to get there. In Salem you have a lot of choices! Plus grocery outlet for snacks, meats, easy meals. \n\nIs there an \u201ceveryday deals\u201d there? That\u2019s a \u201cfall off the truck\u201d store. Im only familiar with the Portland ones, but it\u2019s rock bottom prices on grocery\u2019s. \n\nCould your wife train for a phone customer service job? The state of Oregon was actually hiring for that for benefits and what not recently. If you are in Salem look at the state jobs. I know she did a good job raising your kids, could she work at a day care?",

Remember, a car is the opposite of a house -- it immediately depreciates the moment you buy it, and never really stops depreciating. Never get upside-down in a vehicle loan\\*, and ideally never borrow money for a car.\n\n\\*Never get upside-down in any loan, but cars are the easiest asset to make that mistake with. That's why there's an entire industry built around \"gap insurance.\"",

I did it with a family member because we need at least a six figure income to get a toe in the market and neither of us earns six figures alone. I supplied the down payment and other associated costs. I had the required savings due to being very frugal. It meant paying off all my school debt, public transit, cooking everything, free/cheap entertainment, working as much overtime as I can and/or picking up side work and since I'm single it meant living in rough areas with housemates for the cheapest rent I could find. One winter a snow bank was my freezer. Another place had me in a former mud room with no insulation so I used a space heater. Even with all my sacrifices I couldn't get the kind of home I would have wanted. This is a matchbox of a place and it's a \"condo\"... but that's the market here even with the interest rates. My family member needed a place so we took the plunge. Otherwise I'd have kept working and saving and looking for better areas in the country to move to.\n\n\nIt doesn't matter what you think you should be able to get. You need to meet the market.

My requirements were the same as yours, my salary was then quite a bit lower than yours, and I was a single earner with major medical expenses.\n\nFirst of all, I find it hard to accept that houses in Salem pre-pandemic were 140-160k. Around the time I bought my house I was considering moving to Oregon. I do not have the exact numbers for Salem because I was looking at Eugene primarily, but just does not seem true for a house in good condition. In any case, you are buying now, not then. The time to get on the property train is anytime you can, at least for a primary residence.\n\nHere is what I did as a single earner on a lower salary in order to give my family a 3bed 2ba home with a nice yard in a safe neighborhood.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n* drove a very old Toyota which I bought outright for under 10k. I am now driving a different old Toyota which cost more, but I could still purchase it outright.\n* Single car household. \n* No debt back then except some medical debt, so debt to income ratio was good.\n* Took on extra hustles to be able to put more down and afford moving+expenses.\n* I looked primarily at fixer homes in my area. \n* Aimed for a quiet and safe neighborhood but not upscale\n* I did my own research, trying to drive and walk around and spot homes as they went on sale. This is how I found my home. Timing is EVERYTHING in a hot market. Educated myself about my market, neighborhoods I was targeting, sales history (Zillow is great for that).\n* Interviewed multiple realtors and lenders.\n* Bought a house in bad cosmetic condition but good structural condition. You can fix the cosmetic stuff if the bones are good, but buyers tend to get fixated on the cosmetics.\n* After buying the house, the whole family invested sweat equity - and we are still working on it. We repainted, cleaned up the dumpster yard, put a lot of elbow grease and research into redoing the kitchen on a shoestring, beautified the yard, etc. \n\nOutcome: house has appreciated, my salary significantly increased, and I can now afford a much more expensive home, but our house has everything we need.\n\nBest of luck!",

I shop at thrift stores. I used a separate thermometer to check the fridge/freezer temps and found I could safely increase a degree or two so it's not running as much. I use Ting for phone. I use an antenna (no paid TV services). I drive a 20 year old car in very good shape.

Your landlord jacking up your rent is jacking up my blood pressure! I'm sorry that you're faced with all of this. That said, home ownership is not necessarily a panacea. I find even a small yard is actually a lot of work. It's not just mowing....it's more involved than that. Multiple hours outside every week during the spring, summer, and fall.

Definitely look into that if you haven't and try to get all the support you can from there if there is any.",

Personally, I\u2019ve made tons but it\u2019s how you learn! We get it, the car was a bad idea, but I\u2019ve seen much worse\u2026\n\nGetting rid of that student loan in a few years will be huge, that\u2019s the time to buy the house. And you\u2019ll have time to prepare - you can have $0 debt other than a mortgage at that time.\n\nHere is my advice from someone who started with way less salary, loves spending money on cars, and now I have 14 properties and is worth $7 million. Try to sell the car for as much as you can. If you get $37k, use cash on hand to pay off remainder. The down payment and loss is a sunk cost, so don\u2019t dwell on it. Buy a very inexpensive but reliable car if you can (Honda, Toyota, Acura, Lexus), using cash. Buy a 2 bed, 1 bath - small house, condo or townhome that is equivalent to your rental, make sure it will rent nicely (cash flow positive once PMI is removed). You\u2019ll only need a small down payment which is fine. Live there a few years, save money, and then rent it out (if you\u2019re willing to be a landlord, which is not hard for condos). Buy your 3 bed/2 bath in a few years. Remember, ignore interest rates, you can always refinance residential properties with no penalty (just a bit in closing costs). If rates go up, you\u2019ll be happy you bought. If rates go down, refinance.\n\nDefinitely cut food expense/meal kits. Costco in bulk with prep is your best bet! Don\u2019t buh other small stuff you can\u2019t afford, it adds up! If you have to buy or replace something broken, look at lightly used options on Craigslist, eBay or FB Marketplace. Lots of great deals to be had!\n\nGood luck!!",

Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for a down payment.\n\nThe banks are tightening lending requirements because the FED is raising interest rates. Do your best to lower your debt so that you can receive a favorable mortgage rate from your lender in the future and frees up more cash for your monthly budget.

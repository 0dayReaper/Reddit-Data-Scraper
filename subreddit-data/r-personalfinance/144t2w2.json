    "postText": "We started renting out our house two years ago unexpectedly (I am not a real estate expert) when we decided to not sell because we weren't getting what we felt like were fair offers in a really competitive market. Our best offer was in the mid $650ks when a house with the same floorplan sold slightly over $710k about a month before. We had already started the closing process on another mid $750k house, which we now live in, and we didn't want to lose it for various reasons. I'm a little over 12 months from the 3 year capital gains exemption deadline and I am unsure of whether I should sell my rental within the next 12 months or keep it (probably for a very long time). We were the first residents and had lived in it just over 2 years. Here are some financial details that are relevant.\n\n* Debt to income is \\~15% (Pretty much only have mortgage debt)\n* Debt to assets is \\~50% (only have \\~$30k equity in my current house)\n* Have a 6 month emergency fund\n* $415k in investments ($20k brokerage, $300k retirement, $55k HSA, $40k 529 with 2 kids and 14+ years to go for each)\n* Clear the mortgage (3.675%), interest, property taxes and management fees by $11,000 per year\n* Have about $325k in equity on rental, so get all cap gains exempted \n* I am the breadwinner (90%+ income)\n\nThe numbers seem to indicate I should keep this, but I feel like I've only seen the positive side on being a landlord. I haven't experienced a real estate market in which I haven't found renters. I have had pretty low maintenance renters and I haven't had many expenses due to the age of the house. \n\nIf I did sell, I would use the proceeds to pay off some of the mortgage on my current loan (decrease debt) and invest the remainder. \n\nAre there things that I'm not thinking about that I should think about?\n\nThanks for your feedback!",

                    "comment": "Thanks for the insight. I would invest in equities, so even more of a reason to sell. \n\nI should mention that I'm also weighing the increase in value of the property into the decision as well. I live in a high growth city with high skilled labor, current and future projected housing shortages, etc. A lot can happen in 10+ years, but it's certainly not a Detroit (no offense to Detroit or its residents). I suppose ultimately the question is do I think a 3.3% plus annual return on the value of the house, which has a ton of uncertainty, is going to be higher than the alternative investment, whether risk free bonds or equities.",

They\u2019ll be easy to vet based on income, etc. \n\nDefer the capital gains with a 1031 exchange down the road you\u2019ll have supplemental rental income forever that will pay you I excess of what you\u2019ll save in interest payments on the current house.",

            "comment": "You haven't mentioned the interest rate on your current home; unless it's super low - you're probably paying MORE interest on your current home than the net return on the rental.\n\nIf your interest rate is 4% for instance; you'd be paying 13K in interest vs the 11K that you get.\n\nThere MAY be some offset from the tax benefit of rental (claiming depreciation) but unlikely to make a significant difference.\n\nNext : It sounds like the rental is a new home (you lived for 2 years, and were the first); but if you start getting any significant repairs / maintenance expenses (replacing appliances / getting it repainted / roof issues etc.) - then the 11K net goes. \n\nIt depends on your interest rate - and what other returns you can get. 11K on 325K is ~3+% rate of return; HYSA's are in the 4.5% or higher range. If your mortgage interest rate is higher - then that's a better return.\n\nUnless you think the home is going to appreciate phenomenally (capital value) - but then by that time, you'd have crossed the limit for capital gains exemption.\n\n\nIf I were you - I'd sell and redeploy.",

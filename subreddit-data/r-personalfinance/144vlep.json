    "postText": "I\u2019m in what I believe to be a decently unique situation and I\u2019m looking for what the best next steps are for my financial goals. My parents are great parents and people, but they aren\u2019t interested in discussing financial matters with me, period.\n\nI am 18 years old and going to online trade school for Construction Management full time beginning next fall. I will be living at home rent free for at least the next two years, have no car expenses besides gas and insurance (around $1000/year \u2014 this is out of my control and I have 1 single-car crash on my record) and make $22 an hour working full time in construction (MCOL area in MN). My program is at a local vocational school and costs about $12k total; this is paid for entirely through a 529 plan from my grandparents. I plan to continue working full time while in school; this is doable for me. My career will start at ~$60,000 with well over 6 figure earning potential.\n\nAs for goals, I am looking to purchase a home in roughly 3 years with my girlfriend in the south, likely SC, NC, KY or TN. She is also debt free and currently in cosmetology school that she paid off herself. She makes a little under $1,500 a month working part time right now. Combined, we have slightly over $20k in the bank, and we\u2019d like to invest a significant portion of that money. We both have limited credit history with great credit scores.\n\nEssentially, I\u2019m asking:\n\n- How much of that $20k should we invest? I\u2019m talking long-term investments, mutual funds, etc.\n\n- How much should I be setting aside for a down payment (and where) and how much should I be investing? ~$2,500 net monthly income with $400ish required expenses.\n\n- How realistic is buying a house in 2026-2027? Depends on the area and state, but we\u2019re thinking $250k max. We will stay where we move to long-term. I\u2019m worried loan approval will be an issue, even if we have the down payment.\n\n- How much should I put on my credit card each month? Right now, I\u2019m only using it for gas (substantial \u2014 I drive a truck).\n\n\nThank you in advance and I can answer any questions within 8 hours.",

Your gf could too. You\u2019d also want to see if your company offers a 401(k) match and/or HSA.\n\nStay on your parent\u2019s health insurance if they\u2019re willing to do it for you.\n\nBe a little careful about combining finances with another person while you\u2019re that young. Relationships in life sometimes take time to figure out. \n\nThe house stuff can\u2019t really be predicted. Just keep earning, saving and investing. And learning your trade + adding value as an employee. Time is on your side.",

I\u2019m kind of embarrassed to say I don\u2019t know whether there\u2019s a 401k for my position but I will figure that out.\n\nHealth insurance isn\u2019t a problem, they want me to stay on it for now.\n\nI know \u2014 nothing officially combined until the house, but I do think she\u2019s the one. Young and dumb, maybe, but you only live once right? Haha\n\nReally appreciate the comment.",

For precisely the reason you said - housing prices are likely going to keep getting steeper.\n\nAn emergency fund for an 18 year old kid who lives at home rent free? Couple hundred bucks in the sock drawer should be fine. Not likely to have a major medical expense (unless he gets hurt at work, which would be covered) and he doesn't have any rent to pay. Plus he has 20k in the bank.\n\nPreparing for retirement at 18? Yes that would be excellent but makes no sense to do before you get a house. Not owning your own home is gonna be the number one thing to make your retirement way more expensive and difficult. He still has plenty of time to put money towards that, it's a long way off.\n\nHe asked how to invest the 20k. I'm not sure why he wants to invest it long term when he wants to buy a home - it should be the 'down payment' fund in my opinion. A house is probably the best investment he can make anyway.",

Being able to move for career growth or higher wages, pays lifetime dividends.\n\nYour IRA and 401(k) don\u2019t really care where in the world you work, but owning a home ties you to a specific location. For that reason, I really think it is better to save and invest for retirement and a down payment then to buy the house you can afford at 22. \n\nThe best part is that you can even save cash in a Roth IRA and pull out the same amount you have contributed without penalty without waiting for retirement.",

Yes, you have a great situation now, but it doesn't hurt to start those financial habits now. So estimate that, and keep that in the bank. \n\nBTW if your bank isn't giving you good interest, shop around - you might be able to open up an account with a one- year 5% rate (I did that in February of this year). \n\nAs far as housing, well, who knows where you'll be in a few years? But you can definitely start planning for it and saving. Set yourself a target range and you can start with a goal of 20% down.\n\n(Edited to respond to OP).",

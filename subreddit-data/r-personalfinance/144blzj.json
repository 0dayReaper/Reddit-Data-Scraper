    "postText": "Trying to figure out where I should prioritize between these 2. Currently maxing out both my Roth IRA and 401k. Don\u2019t have an HSA as with my 2 young kids and the healthcare costs associated with that. My costs make the low deductible plan the better deal for this moment in life. So out of the after tax conversion or typical brokerage where should I focus on and does this change as I get older. Im only 29 so I think the mega backdoor is a really good opportunity for long term tax free growth and don\u2019t plan on retiring super early where I need a big bridge account to hold me over until I can touch retirement assets. Is that a fair assessment?",

The answer is pretty clear.",

            "comment": "Megabackdoor Roth can be withdrawn before 59.5 since it is categorized as \"Conversions\" in the Roth IRA withdrawal order. Example: The MBRs you do in age 29 can be withdrawn in age 35 (5 year rule), or even immediately if you convert before any earnings post into the after-tax account. (This doesn't include earnings after conversion.) If you don't have a clear, shorter-term goal for your income, it's better to not waste the opportunity for tax-free growth (and still have the chance to take money out early).",

But don't forget that your final years before retirement are likely going to be your highest earning years. You can fill up a bridge account in those years. For now, I think you should get as much money as you can into these accounts where that money can grow without any tax drag whatsoever.",

            "comment": "I started my investing journey before Roth was invented.  So there was no megabackdoorRoth.  Further, my employer hasn't offered after-tax 401k contributions, never mind megabackdoor.  Once I was hitting the federal max, I went into taxable.  It can be used anytime for any reason.  Including to supplement your 401k.\n\nThe problem with tax-free, is it comes with \"federal entanglements.\"  Congress makes the rules and Congress changes the rules.\n\nAs far as taxable investments...people talk about the \"tax headwinds\" generated by having to pay yearly taxes on those investments.  Yeah, I suppose that's kinda true.  But I don't take money out of my investments to pay the taxes generated.  It comes out of my work income.  And it's not that much...  yes, less taxes is better, but 15% on the dividends and capital gains distributions from my mutual funds really isn't that onerous.\n\nI've made it somewhere into my mid-late 50s without touching any of my investments, and I don't really have plans to retire.  I know I will someday.  At *this* point in my life and career, I would hit hard on the mega back door Roth if offered.  But I don't have a lot of spending goals and I've got plenty set aside between taxable and retirement...so I could stop with the taxable saving if megabackdoor was there for me.\n\nIt all comes down to your personal goals and your philosophy.  First of all, I don't trust Congress not to change the rules in a way that adversely affects my ability to spend retirement savings before age 59 1/2.",

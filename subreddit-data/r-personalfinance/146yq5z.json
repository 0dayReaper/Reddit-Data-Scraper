    "postText": "Quick background:\n\n* M29 / $220k salary / not married (gf and I live together, she makes $50k but it's not factored into any of this) \n* Live in MN. Moving to FL (yeah, I know...) \n* Bought current house last August, $420K at 5% using the VA Home Loan ($2.8k/m mortgage) \n* Have up to $100k liquid for a new house down payment and can use the VA Home Loan again\n\n--------\n\n\nThe house I currently own is great. Move-in ready, beautiful suburban neighborhood, very close to a big public lake and schools.\n\nThe city is growing quickly and becoming increasingly popular for those looking to move out of the immediate Minneapolis area. \n\nWe're moving to the Tampa area and will likely rent an apt/townhouse until we find a new house to buy. \n\nMy rationale for not selling and going the renter route:\n\n* I love it, love the neighborhood, and it's just an all around perfect house and area. 4bd/2ba, 2 living rooms, giant yard. Would be great for a new family.\n* I recognize this property will very very likely continue to increase in value based solely on the popularity of the area. Acknowledging that current prices are inflated, but I'm picturing long term-- 10+ years. \n\nOn the other hand, I fully understand renting it out comes with a whole slew of risk and uncertainties. \n\nMy father lives a couple minutes away and recently became a landlord for 2 properties in a nearby small town with his business pal. He's fully willing to manage my current property if I take the renter route (and he's of course in favor of that option). \n\n----- \n\nI'm torn about what the smartest move is. I'm not intentionally trying to become a landlord and I'm not looking to price gouge the hypothetical renters-- In my view the property is the investment, not the extra $200-300/m I would get from padding the rent. \n\nIf the house sits for a bit or renters don't pay rent I wouldn't be underwater covering the mortgage, but there would still be an impact. \n\nCurious if there are any glaring holes in this idea.",

I know there are certain places with high housing prices so that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t say \u201call.\u201d But in typical suburbs, rent is ridiculously high. In the tune of $1600+ for a 1br, $2500+ for a 2br, and $3200*+ for a 3br apartment.\n\nOf course, if you got your house and loan after covid, chances are you\u2019re paying high interest. But if you got your house pre-covid, it\u2019s a good bet you have a good mortgage and would likely be less than if you rent the same size house/apartment.",

If your father has the capacity to look after the home while you're in Tampa, why not do it?\n\nIt's also an additional form of income for you, and the tenant would help with paying the mortgage on the home.

The Social Security Administration grants requests for new Social Security numbers only in cases when:\r  \n1.\tSequential numbers assigned to members of the same family are causing problems.\r  \n2.\tMore than one person is assigned or using the same number.\r  \n3.\tA victim of identity theft continues to be disadvantaged by using the original number. Which means it cost you money.\r  \n4.\tThere is a situation of harassment, abuse or life endangerment\r  \n5.\tAn individual has religious or cultural objections to certain numbers or digits in the original number.\r  \nUsually you have to get your Congress(wo)man office involved because it is a lot of work for the Social Security Admin to change your number.  I used work in Social Services and victims of domestic violence #4 would often change their SSN so they could not be tracked, but SSA would often change the web link for the page explaining how to change it. Once it is changed you have to go in person to your bank(s), employer, stock broker, and pension provider to give them the new number; they are only ones required by law to need your new SSN right away. You will have to provide it in the future for filing taxes, a credit check such as renting an apartment a loan or when other government agencies demand it. Do not give your dad you new SSN https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/change-social-security-number-ssn/",

If you noticed the current rule I posted say you have to be hurt by SSN thief . The reality if you go to your local Congress(wo)man office and they take your side they will quickly change you SSN.\n\nWhen SS was setup in the 1930s the law said your SSN could not be used as ID just you and your employer for your retirement account, It was amended to allow it use for military ID, banks and taxes. The only part of this mostly unforced law is enforced is it can no longer be used for medical insurace and patient id.",

Because a lot of people wait to file until April, it's easy for a nefarious actor to use your SSN and file a tax return with fake or made up data.  Which really hits when you go to file, and the IRS says \"we already have a filing for that SSN\".  And then you spend a lot of time and effort sorting out that tangled knot.\n\nGet yourself and Identity Protection PIN from the IRS.  [https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/get-an-identity-protection-pin](https://www.irs.gov/identity-theft-fraud-scams/get-an-identity-protection-pin)\n\nThe IRS will snail mail you a PIN every year that you can enter with your tax return that will allow yours through, but will stymie any bad actors from getting their fake returns in.",

Yes someone could try to apply for credit in your name but banks are all aware of the scams and do a lot of identity crosschecking before they will ever cut a check. For one, they'll never deposit money into an account that can't be tied to you and they won't mail a card to an address they can't verify and match. Freezing your credit is an option, and might be smart initially, but credit monitoring is usually what is offered when a number is breached. Millions of Americans have free monitoring from the various known hacks. That will let you know immediately if someone applies for credit in your name and you can quickly shut it down.",

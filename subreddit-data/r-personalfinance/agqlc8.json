They're goal isn't to make money off of you.  \n\nCompanies are owned by people/shareholders/cats and their goal is to make money for those people/shareholders/cats.  In the case of Fidelity/etc. the people buying the investment funds are a different group than the people who own the company.  So they want to make money off you for the owners.  This means the highest expense ratio they can charge, because that maximizes profit.  \n\nVanguard funds are owned by the people who invest in the funds.  Their goal is to make you money.  This means the lowest expense ratio that still collects enough money to run the fund.  \n\nOther companies see that everyone is buying Vanguard and slash expense ratios to be competitive and keep you invested with them and maximize profit, not because they want just enough money to keep running.  \n\nThere's other differences in how Vanguard is organized, but my point is there is reason to do that (cut expense ratios) because Vanguard has a different operational philosophy than other investment companies.

If he wanted money he could have easily bumped expense ratios by 0.1% or whatever and put it right in his pocket.\n\nAnd that's exactly what most of wall street does and exactly what he was morally and philosophically opposed to. He could have very easily been a billionaire and he was quoted saying his peers made fun of him for not being one. But instead of hoarding that money he gave it all away to the investors.\n\nDefinitely one of the better philanthropists of our time for that. He just did it in a much quieter, longer term and more invisible way than hoarding wealth then making a hospital or whatever. ",

The brokerage earns a modest and fair management fee. Competitors are forced to adapt, but they too can benefit by offering similar low-fee funds.

These guys were all pretentious pricks. Sure, consumers saw wonderful benefits from their inventions, lower prices, increased convenience and consumerism. These guys all exploited their respective workforce, played dirty, and took the excess of capitalism to its extremes.\n\nHenry Ford was actually sued by some of his investors (the Dodge brothers) because he wanted to pay Ford workers more. They investors wanted that profit, and actually won. They used that money to to start their own car company Dodge. Henry Ford was a shitheel in many ways, but he actually believed in paying workers enough to buy the cars they built.",

Today, you can buy one share and no one bats an eye.\n\nThis the major reason why stocks don't split as often as they used to. In the past, companies had to keep share prices relatively cheap in order to ensure that buyers would be able to afford hundreds of shares. High share prices could lead to illiquidity.",

He was so incredibly connected to not only the business, but everyone that worked for him, even after he retired and was no longer running the show and the company had grown into a juggernaut.\n\nThe guy was not just brilliant, but his humility and integrity came through like a beacon when you spoke with him.   He was absolutely the real deal.  I cried today when I heard.  Even though I no longer work for that company, I keep large portions of my assets there which is a testament to my trust in the business and the people there, and one of the few places I've ever worked in my career where the mission statements about client commitment and ethics weren't just lip service for the benefit of prospective customers.  He built that commitment into most every layer of the company.\n\nNever worked for anyone else in my career that I had such deep respect and admiration for.  He lived to his principals, and his impact to the industry really can't be overstated\n",

He got around the distribution compromise by switching the funds to no-load--selling shares directly without an up-front fee instead of going through the brokers controlled by Wellington. Then, in 1976, came the Vanguard Index Trust, which, because it simply aimed to track the S&amp;P 500, got around the boards' decision to leave money \"management\" in the hands of Wellington. (Wellington Management is still around and still manages some Vanguard funds. But not many.) \"It was one of the great acts of disingenuous opportunism defined by the mind of man,\" Bogle says now.\n\nEdit here is the article: https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2003/01/20/335617/",

A win win for investors and Vanguard.\n\nThis had two parts one, active vs passive investment. Jeremy Siegel and others noticed that active management (people picking individual stocks for a fund) rarely beat the market (buying one of every stock) in the long run, and the difference is even larger when fees are considered. \n\nSo Jack made it his mission to educate people on this and then to back that up by having vanguard offer index funds with the industry's lowest rates for a long time. \n\nSo we went from an era where it was typical to pay 5% up front plus 1-3% a year to where we are today which is &lt;.1% and some companies even have no fee index funds!!! that is a MASSIVE massive massive difference when you think about investing for retirement over 40 years.  So he did the right thing, educated people on the most efficient way to invest in the long term and pushed the entire market's fee structure down. ",

We didn\u2019t get to speak long (everyone wanted to talk to him), but he said I was off to a good start in life and fortunate and that I shouldn\u2019t blow it. After meeting him, and finally having steady income in a fairly promising job, I was inspired to read up on investing and his ideas on strategy. Now I\u2019m putting $500 into a Vanguard account every two weeks (VTSAX for now, will diversify later, got plenty of time). I expect to spend the better part of the next 40 years getting paid every two weeks. As I get raises, I\u2019ll up my contributions, and I should be able to retire early and comfortably because of his advice and company. ",

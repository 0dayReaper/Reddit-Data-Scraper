    "postText": "**Holy shit at the money people spend on food!**\n\nAnd I was the exact same way when I landed my first job out of college.  You know what I'm talking about--biscuit and Starbucks on the way to work, lunch out with coworkers and pizza and beer at the local tavern for dinner!  Every night!  All week!  Professional money spender!  And more beers and dinners on the weekends!  Woohoo!\n\nWait.  Where did all my money go?  And how the hell did I gain 40 pounds in six months?  If you're nodding your head you've fallen into the brand-new-job-big-salary-eat-out-because-I-can trap.  And you have to stop it.  It's killing your bank account, it's killing your financial freedom and it's killing *you*. (Literally--I was on the edge of type 2 diabetes and had hyperglycemia during routine physicals.)\n\n**What you know you need to do: *STOP EATING OUT***\n\nBut how??? How do I stop eating out???  Fast food is *soooo* good!  And cooking is *soooo* hard!  Well, first off, not really--you're just attuned to that garbage 'food'.  You're going to break free of both these stereotypes and someone has already invented it.....\n\n&gt;Crockpot.  It's the crockpot.  Crockpot.  Crockpot.  Maybe you call it a slow cooker, but I'm from Georgia and here it's a crockpot.  \n\n***!STOP!***--If you do not own a crockpot I highly recommend you go buy one from Amazon and buy the biggest one you can afford!\n\nGet one with a timer that switches to warm after the cook settings: *JUST GOOGLE IT CAUSE MODS DONT LIKE LINKS!*\n\n**BOOM!**  $39 investment.  We're going to make that back in.... *three days*.  Are you ready?  We're going to make enough food for dinner *AND* left overs for lunch.\n\nI'm going to give you some of my super-secret-I-eat-this-every-week-crockpot-meals that are delicious, cheap, filling and easy.  Yes.  The crockpot makes *all* of those possible.\n\n**MEAL 1: Thick Cut Porkchop with Potatoes and Carrots**\n\n&gt;Servings: 4\n\n&gt;Ingredients:\n\n&gt;1 Can Beef Broth (50 cents)\n\n&gt;1 Packet Brown Gravy Mix (50 cents)\n\n&gt;1 Packet Onion Soup Mix (50 cents)\n\n&gt;1 Package of 4 Thick Cut Porkchops ($7)\n\n&gt;6 Carrots (50 cents)\n\n&gt;4 Large Gold Yukon Potatoes ($2)\n\n&gt;Sack o' Salad ($2)\n\n&gt;Total cost for lunch and dinner: $13/4 about $3 each.\n\n&gt;Spray or wipe crockpot with cooking oil.  Add beef broth, gravy mix and onion soup mix and stir.  Place porkchops in broth.  Chop carrots and potatoes and add to top of porkchops.  That's it.\n\n&gt;PREPARE THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED FOR THE NEXT DAY!  Put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  When you get home make your salad and dig in.  Use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.\n\n**MEAL 2: Sausage, Potato and Kale Soup**\n&gt;Servings: 4\n\n&gt;1 Pound Italian Sausage ($4)\n\n&gt;1 White Onion ($1)\n\n&gt;1 32 Oz Box of Chicken Stock ($1.50)\n\n&gt;1 Bag of Prewashed Kale ($3)\n\n&gt;3/4 Cup Heavy Cream ($1)\n\n&gt;5 Large Gold Yukon Potatoes ($2)\n\n&gt;1 Head of Garlic ($1)\n\n&gt;Total cost: About $14/4 = 3.50 a serving\n\n&gt;Brown italian sausage with chopped garlic and chopped onion.  While meat is browning add to crockpot the 3/4 cup of heavy cream, chicken stock, and chopped yukon potatoes.  Add browned sausage and top with half the bag of kale.  (I get two recipes per bag of kale).\n\n&gt;PREPARE THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED FOR THE NEXT DAY!  Put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  When you get home dig in! Use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.\n\n**MEAL 3: Super Awesome Easy Chili**\n&gt;Servings: A Lot (6-8?) -- I eat this *all* the time and it's delicious.  Stores really well in the refrigerator (and chili gets better over time!)\n\n&gt;3 Cans of Black Beans ($2)\n\n&gt;2 Cans of Hot Chili Beans ($1)\n\n&gt;2 Cans of Red Kidney Beans ($1)\n\n&gt;8 Cans of Diced Tomatoes ($6)\n\n&gt;1 Pound of Ground Beef ($4)\n\n&gt;1/2 Cup of Chili Powder ($1)\n\n&gt;1/4 Cup of Garlic Powder ($1)\n\n&gt;1/4 Cup of Onion Powder ($1)\n\n&gt;3 Tablespoons of Cumin ($1)\n\n&gt;3 Tablespoons Black Pepper ($1)\n\n&gt;Edit: The spice proportions are correct!  This makes nearly two gallons of good (about 7L).\n\n&gt;Edit: Salt to Taste($1)\n\n&gt;Total cost = $20/8 = About $2.50 per serving\n\n&gt;Drain the tomatoes and kidney beans but don't drain the black or chili beans.  Brown the ground beef.  Add everything to the crockpot and stir like crazy.... and that's it!\n\n&gt;PREPARE THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED FOR THE NEXT DAY!  Put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  When you get home dig in! Use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.\n\n\nIt's easy guys.  It's really easy.  You spend 15 minutes a night and you make *tons* of food for lunch and dinner and you save a LOT of money!  AND ITS GOOD FOR YOU! (better than Wendy's--that's for sure!)  AND ITS EASY!\n\n**Stop spending your money on eating out and go full crockpot!  I am much happier and much wealthier!**\n\nEDIT: For our vegetarian friends.  You can't get any more simple than this!\n\n**MEAL 4: Baked Potato**\n&gt;Servings: As many potatoes as you bake\n\n&gt;1 Potato\n\n&gt;Cover in tin foil and place directly in crockpot.  Cook on low 4-6 hours or keep on warm all day.\n\n\n**MEAL 5: Vegetable Soup**\n&gt;Servings: However much you want to make\n\n&gt;Tomatoes, Potatoes, Green Beans, Zucchini, Carrots, Peas, or Onions\n\n&gt;Vegetable Stock\n\n&gt;Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Salt and Black Pepper\n\n&gt;Add vegetables in any proportion you desire to crockpot and add vegetable stock until covered.  Season to taste.  Cook on low until vegetables are tender.\n\nEDIT 2: I live in Georgia and shop at Kroger--prices may vary.  If you live in Canadia or buy organic free range vegetables harvested by hipsters with a minimum of a master's degree you will obviously pay more.\n\nEDIT 3: \"Just learn to cook!\"--Yeah, okay guys.  I agree.  I cook more than just in a crockpot.  This post was inspired after I read a /r/personalfinance about a single guy who spends $1300 a month on food because \"he didn't have enough time to cook with work\".  I wrote a very long comment and just made it into a post.  The point was you can eat decent food in a short amount of time and save money by planning one day ahead.  \n\nEDIT 4: I agree fresh vegetables are better and these aren't the *healthiest* recipes.  This post was just to encourage those that eat all the time to transition to something healthier... and then they can transition to something even healthier... and on and on until they've become a raw vegan, growing their own vegetables, saving the whales and composting regularly.\n\nEDIT 5: Electricity costs: Crockpots seem to consume between 200W and 700W per hour.  That's between 2 and 6 kWhs for 8 hours of cooking.  That's about 15 to 60 cents.  It seems insignificant relative to the overall cost of food.\n\nEDIT 6: I'm not a shill or marketing person for crockpot.  I'm a mechanical engineer.  Don't believe me?  My first post on reddit ever was about bolt failures:  https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/3e20vs/bolt_failure_modes/ctatj1y/\n\nTake off your tin foil hat..... and use it to wrap a baked potato to put in your *new crockpot!!!*",

Imports of these products are also discouraged with tariffs that run as high as 202 per cent for skim milk and 298 per cent on butter.

Odds are, if you've had a \"good\" version (good restaurant, good home cook) version of something like a stew, and then you make a \"typical\" crock pot version, the crock pot version is bland and mushy.  The \"good\" version browns the meat before it's put in the stew (and may only add it at the last minute).  Browning creates a lot of flavor and in many cases some more texture by \"crisping\" the meat, in contrast to the \"mushiness\" of a typical long/slow cooked stew.\n\nLook for recipes that brown the meat before adding it to the pot.  (In your $14 cast iron skillet.  See if your grandmother has your great grandmother's cast iron in the attic or something to give you.)",

It has the added benefit that you're almost always done in under an hour.  I made chicken and lentil stew the other day - sauteed the veg, then sealed and set the timer for 22 minutes, and it was perfect. Plus, mine automatically sets to warming for 10 hours after pressure, but you can go up to 99.  To me, it has the benefits of crockpots without always having to wait forever for everything.  ",

Why the hell spend more money on baby carrots or pre cleaned pre cut carrots when you can buy a shit ton of carrots for $1-2 and wash them in 1 minute. Peel them if they have bad parts on it but other than that, its good to go.\n\nOP even talks about buying cans and stuff. You can save even MORE money by buying bulk foods, freezing stuff, cooking stuff you're gonna eat for a few days, and save more time and money than whats mentioned in this thread. ",

It's a useful step to help people who are new to providing meals for themselves every day understand that \"cooking's not so difficult after all.\" It also provides a \"safety net\" of easy at-home meals if someone wants to take a break from cooking.",

I tried to save money by buying groceries, meal planning, cooking every night, I had the best of intentions. Buuuuut Tokyo Joe\u2019s is directly across the street. I can see it from my balcony. So $100 worth of groceries went bad in my fridge, and I still ate out, so it ended up costing me more. Because I\u2019m lazy. But I can do a crockpot. Most days. \n\nPlus, since I don\u2019t cook a lot, it\u2019s always expensive to go shop for all those spices, I usually have to buy some kind of kitchen item I don\u2019t own or a special pan that didn\u2019t come with the set I got at family dollar. Then I don\u2019t know the right way to chop things so chopping things takes me like 20 minutes... ",

If planning and preparation is the main contributor to eating out, then it doesn't help in that regard.\n\nA pressure cooker has all the same advantages but compressed into 20-40 minutes. \n\n1. They cost about the same, or if you want to splurge, you can get a crock pot/pressure cooker combo (but they cost more).\n\n2. They are very fast, so you can still use those cheap cuts of meat to make stews for example, but in 30 mins instead of 2 hours.  Same goes for certain veggies and stuff that can take a long time (dried beans, that kind of thing). \n\n3. It expands the possible repertoire of dishes you can prepare in 30-40 minutes to include things that would normally take a couple hours or more. \n\n4. They are usually pretty big, so you can prep several days worth of food. \n\n5. I find the texture of the resulting meal to be better since you can pressure cook the meat and sauce, and then add in vegetables at the end so they don't overcook and turn to mush. \n\n6. You can use it like a normal pot if you don't want to use the pressure valve. \n\nSo if you're reading this and thinking \"8 hours? Ain't nobody got time for that!\" you should look into pressure cookers. ",

Now I have a Phillips combo pressure cooker / crockpot thing, and amazingly I haven't died or coated the kitchen area of my studio in tomato yet. And the thing works and is ridiculously easy to use.\n\nThe caveat is that it is neither a real pressure cooker nor a real crock pot.  For example, water doesn't evaporate in the slow cooker mode, so you have to know to put less in if you're making a sauce kind of thing that calls for liquid in the recipe. And the pressure cooker mode doesn't get high enough pressure to do, for example, canning. But as one device that can do both, depending on whether I want to prep late at night and eat for lunch the next day, or prep immediately to eat that night, it works.",

In a small pan with the gas on medium, put enough oil to cover the bottom by a good amount. Once it's hot enough, one teaspoon jeera (it should be sizzling), then add diced onion. Once the onion looks clear, add the tomato. Fry it until the tomato is soft, then put it in the slow cooker. Add a spoon of salt, a spoon of butter/ghee, and a big as spoon of rajma masala. Eat with rice, and also yogurt if you want. Definitely not bland, but also not very spicy if you eat with yogurt. The salt/butter/masala ratio is probably off but I'm still trying to get it right.\n\nMy mom told me this recipe so it won't taste as spicy as restaurant rajma, try it sometime and send me pics!",

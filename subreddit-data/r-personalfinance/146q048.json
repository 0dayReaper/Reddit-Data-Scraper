    "postText": "Recently got accepted into a fully funded graduate program. I receive 1,700 a month salary, plus healthcare and tuition paid for with grant money. I am in a niche area of STEM with decent employment opportunities after I finish my degree. There are opportunities in government, private sector, and consulting. \n\nMy question is did I make the right choice?\n\nHere are my stats:\n31m - 2 more years before I graduate\n\n39,000 in federal student loans from my undergrad. There are 3 different loans at different rates. \nLoan 1 - 12,500 @ 2%\nLoan 2 - 13,000 @ 3.8%\nLoan 3-  13,000 @ 4.5%\n\nNo CC debt\n\nNo retirement or investments\n\nRent is 750 a month for a 200sq apartment\n\n2 older vehicles paid off\n\n2000's Chevy full size SUV (8cyl)\n1990`s Toyota truck (4cyl)\n\nInsurance is 120 per month for both vehicles\n\nI have a few questions I am looking for guidance / reassurance on. \n\nFirst is my vehicle situation. I am thinking about selling the Toyota, but then I am stuck with the gas hog and I drive quite a bit for my project. The Toyota doesn't have AC, a radio, or airbags. There are times when I feel like I need a more substantial vehicle. I also pull trailers for construction projects with the SUV. Does it make sense to sell the little truck? I would potentially save about 50 per month in insurance, plus the cash from the sale. \n\nSecond is should I take out an additional student loan to pad give myself a bit of a financial cushion. I can barrow up to 20,000 this year at 7.5% interest. I was thinking about barrowing 6,000 to have a small emergency fund. I only have about 2,000 in liquid assets. If I had a big bill I would have to use my credit cards to pay for the expense. Should I take a loan at 7.5% to hedge my bets, or roll the dice and use a credit card to pay for an unexpected bill? \n\nThird - Did I make the right choice to stay in school in school to get a graduate degree. I feel like I am so far behind financially. No retirement savings, living pay check to pay check. My dream is to buy a house with some land to make a little farm while working in my field. Everyone in my family assures me that I made the right choice and not to worry, but they don't help me out financially. Education is a powerful tool and I am pretty passionate about the project I am working on. I just wonder if I should have skipped coming back to school later in life and went the trade school route. \n\nAfter I completey degree I should have a starting salary of 70 to 80k with room to climb into the 6 figures as I establish myself. \n\nShould I sell the truck?\nShould I barrow anymore money?\nDo I have a decent shot at buying a house before I turn 40?",

            "comment": "I did grad school in my thirties and despite the loans have no regrets because financially I'm in a much better position now.  You don't mention what your salary was before grad school, but finishing and being able to start at 70-80k isn't terrible especially if you don't live in a HCOL area.  I presume your income will continue to go up from there.  \n\nSure it sucks not being able to pay into retirement right now, but you're not funding your entire education with loans.  That is a huge win.  You can play retirement catch up later because you won't have that debt.  \n\nHaving an emergency fund is tremendously important.  I drained mine twice in graduate school and the next emergency was funded by loans.  If you can avoid or reduce that I recommend it.  You don't mention having a spouse or live in partner, so in my opinion you don't need two vehicles.  I get wanting them, but they aren't needed.  Selling one will give you some money to put into an emergency fund and save on maintenance, insurance, and registration costs.  Once sold, I would take all the money you would normally have spent maintaining it for the year and add it to the emergency fund.  All of this will give you at least a micro emergency fund which is a start.  \n\nThen consider if there are any other expenses that can be cut or reduced to increase your emergency fund.  Is it possible to take on a flexible low stress side hustle to increase your income temporarily?  Once you've done all of this then reevaluate if taking out a student loan just to beef up an emergency fund makes sense.  You might find that you're fine with a slightly smaller emergency fund, that you hit your emergency fund goal, or that regardless the student loan doesn't make sense.  \n\nI'll let those with more knowledge chime in on the likelihood of you being able to afford buying a home before age 40.  I was nowhere near be able to try making that goal and I'm ok with that.",

My wife worked full time as a teacher the first two years and then went back to school for the next three (with a scholarship that paid a stipend/free tuition). We were able to save about $110k, plus a smidge more in retirement accounts (we didn't qualify for tax advantaged most of the time) that we're going to use for a down payment on a 650k or so house. We're basically just waiting on my onboarding to finish, then applying for financing, then house shopping. So, it's easily conceivable that a more focused individual could finish a PhD and be in their first house by 30. I almost did it and I spent a couple years meandering.",

            "comment": "&gt;My question is did I make the right choice?\n\nGoing to grad school in your thirties after working in your STEM field for a few years as actually the best time to do this. Older adult students are more sure of themselves, have already formed their end goal, and are less likely to waste funds for grad school due to their extreme focus of where they want their career to go in the long run. \n\n&gt;First is my vehicle situation. I am thinking about selling the Toyota, but then I am stuck with the gas hog and I drive quite a bit for my project. The Toyota doesn't have AC, a radio, or airbags. There are times when I feel like I need a more substantial vehicle. I also pull trailers for construction projects with the SUV. Does it make sense to sell the little truck? I would potentially save about 50 per month in insurance, plus the cash from the sale. \n\nIf you're attending a college in an urban area with reliable public transportation, selling the car would help with your finances. You don't have to worry about paying car insurance and other repair expenses.\n\nIf do you need a car, though, you should definitely still replace this one with a car that is low is mileage, has a clean title, not as old, and a similar brand (Honda, Toyota, Hyundai) since they're all reliable vehicle brands.\n\n&gt;Second is should I take out an additional student loan to pad give myself a bit of a financial cushion. I can barrow up to 20,000 this year at 7.5% interest. I was thinking about barrowing 6,000 to have a small emergency fund. I only have about 2,000 in liquid assets.\n\nSince your income is only $1700 a month, you should take out a minimal amount of loans. Only take out what you need to cover for food, daily expenses, and to start an emergency fund.\n\n&gt;Third - Did I make the right choice to stay in school in school to get a graduate degree.\n\nYes. Getting a grad degree in a STEM field automatically opens more doors for higher pay, senior level and management roles in your major. It also depends on what area of STEM you're in, if you're doing a research-oriented degree program or a more practical, hands-on grad degree. You never said what your STEM focus was, but depending on that or your specialization for grad school, you should be able to estimate your salary or career path on sites like Indeed, bls.gov or salary.com.\n\n&gt;Should I sell the truck? Should I barrow anymore money? Do I have a decent shot at buying a house before I turn 40?\n\nYou should sell the truck.\n\nOnly borrow the amount of money you have to. The more you borrow past emergency savings, food, and daily expenses, the money you'll have to pay back. If you're worried about student loan debt, there are companies and government agencies which hire grad students with specific benefits to get rid of student debt, such as non-profit/govt work for student loan forgiveness. I don't have knowledge of this, but there are opportunities available for STEM students. You might want to research this.\n\nI don't have an answer for you on if you'll be able to buy a house at 40. This will be impacted by the amount of student loans you borrow, your ability to pay off those loans, how soon you're able to secure a job in your field of work, salary, and aggressively saving money in the future along with credit score.",

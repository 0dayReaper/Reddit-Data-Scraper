    "postText": "I'm exploring the option of moving out of my condo and possibly downsizing. This might be a very simple question but my overly analytical mind possibly has it twisted.\n\nHere is the break even.\n\n* HOA : \\~$800\n* Property Tax : \\~$1200\n* Mortgage : $2200 (\\~1100 for principal and \\~1100 for mortgage interest)\n* Repairs : None yet in last few years, but can keep $100 a month aside in case something breaks down\n* **Monthly Cost to live: $4300**\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLet's hope I can rent our apartment out for a price such that property management fee, move in move out fee, paint fee etc is all covered and I get $4300 in my account. Question is out of this $4300 that we we were spending how much should we budget towards a rental property?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**Thinking Point 1) Mortgage Interest Deduction**\n\nWhen I live in the hope $1100 \\* 12 = $13,200 can be deducted each year. Our marginal tax is 32% (federal) + 10% (state), which means roughly about \\~$700 per month goes out of pocket vs $1,100.\n\nThis means our **monthly cost (after tax**) to live in an apartment we own **is closer to $3,900**\n\n**Thinking Point 2) $1,100 towards principal is like an investment**\n\nThis point is likely wrong, and haven't thought very deeply. \n\nEven if few years down the line we sell for the same price we bought, then we'll be getting the $1100 per month back, so one way to think of it could be this is a no-yield-savings-account. Hence we shouldn't include this in our monthly rental calculation.\n\nHence should we remove this from $3,800 i.e **$2700** or keep it as is?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnswers =\n\n1. $4300\n2. $4300 - $400 (mortgage interest) = $3900\n3. $4300 - $400 (mortgage interest) - $1100 (principal) = $2800\n4. $4300 - $1100 (principal) = $3200",

            "comment": "The principal repayment portion of your mortgage is not an expense from a conventional accounting sense. This is not an income statement activity, it's a balance sheet activity (disposing of an asset - cash - to reduce a liability - mortgage balance).\n\nSo you're left with HOA, property tax and interest portion of mortgage. These are true expenses in the traditional sense. The net tax impact of your mortgage interest + property tax deductions combined offset a part of that expense.\n\nSo the number you're looking for in a traditional accounting sense is #3.\n\nFrom a budgeting perspective most people will either use #2 or #4.\n\nFrom an economic perspective, it's #3 plus the opportunity cost of your down payment + $1,100/month.",

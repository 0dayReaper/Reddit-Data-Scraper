    "postText": "Hi All, \n\nI am 23 years old and I just inherited 20k. I am kind of lost as to what to do. I never really have invested myself and I don't want to just let it sit in my HYSA. \n\nI have two investment accounts with a family member who is also a financial advisor. I haven't talked to them about the inherited money yet. I would like to see some other opinions first. I tend to find I don't exactly get an explanation of how it is being invested or the thought process behind it. I want to be a bit more hands on with my money. It makes me feel very childlike and out of control lol.... \n\nI was thinking maybe to purchase rental property either alone or w/ my sibling, does that sound like a safe investment? \n\n**Income:**\n\n$75k annual income- 5% going into 401k per check. I will put my annual bonus of roughly 7.5% of my salary in 401k this year. I don't get an employer match at this company unfortunately...\n\n**Debt:** \n\n$179k - Mortgage (I just bought this place in April)\n\nI fortunately don't have any student loans or CC/Consumer debt. I don't own a car. \n\n**Assets:** \n\n$25k -HYSA (Not including the inherited 20k- check hasn't cleared yet)\n\n$2,700 - Self Directed Brokerage (I opened it a few years ago w/ $3k and since covid etc, it hasn't come back up. I don't know if I should touch it. All of the money is in a mutual fund??? I think... Don't quote me)\n\n$14k- Brokerage w/ family member\n\n$7,800 - IRA w/ family member (Rollover from a previous job)\n\n$2k- 401k from current job",

If you don't normally contribute enough to get your full employer match, I would bump up the 401k contributions to get the full match, and then use the inheritance funds as needed to make up the difference in your monthly budget. This may take a few years to use up; if you find additional room in your budget later, you can increase your contributions further.",

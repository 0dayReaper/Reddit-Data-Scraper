    "postText": "So I signed up for Cerebral a few weeks ago, ended up not loving it for various reasons. My subscription was set to auto-renew on June 4. I was out of the country and forgot about the auto-renew until I got an email on June 4 stating that it was about to be renewed, so I log into the app and hit \"cancel subscription\". Immediately I'm locked out of the calendar and the app no longer allows me to schedule future therapy appointments. However, I was still charged for the month of June. Contacted CS and they basically said sorry, you should've canceled sooner. I said ok but I'm being charged for a full month of services while my account is inactive, so I'm being charged for something I'm not getting. I disputed the charge with my credit card (Discover). A week later (today) I log into the app and my ability to schedule appointments for June has been reinstated. Should I dismiss the dispute with Discover, since technically I am now getting the services I was charged for (albeit a week or so where I was unable to utilize the therapy app)? Or should I continue to dispute it since I notified Cerebral that I didn't want it renewed and just wanted a refund?\n\nETA: I've literally never disputed a credit card charge before so I apologize if I'm overthinking it. I'll pay for whatever I have the responsibility to pay for, but this whole thing with Cerebral just feels shady. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Heck this is not a personal attack; the overwhelming majority of managed funds (run by armies of professional stock pickers with their doctorate degrees) suck at picking stocks. 2021 was a bad year for them with 80% of managed mutual funds underperforming the market and that was before fees were accounted for.",

            "comment": "\r\rDollar cost averaging can be a great strategy for buying stocks on a regular basis while managing your budget effectively. \n\nWith this approach, you can invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, such as monthly, regardless of the stock price. This method helps to mitigate the impact of market volatility and removes the need to time the market. \n\nAs you mentioned, since you may not have enough funds to buy all 10 stocks at once, you can prioritize your selection and gradually allocate your monthly investment to different stocks based on your investment goals and research. \n\nThis way, you can build a **diversified portfolio over time**, including any new stocks that catch your interest along the way. \n\nIt's crucial to conduct thorough research, and keep up to date on the stocks you're interested in to ensure your investment strategy aligns with your risk tolerance and long-term objectives. There are a lot of great resources for financial news online; Google News, Axios, [Evenfeed](https://www.evenfeed.io/). \n\nThe point is to keep as up to date as possible to make the most informed decision possible. \n\nBest of Luck!",

The only problem, your stocks might not offer this as an option.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www-us.computershare.com/Investor/#DirectStock](https://www-us.computershare.com/Investor/#DirectStock)\n\nThat is a company, computer share, that operates DRPs for 100s of companies.\n\nTypically, the DRP needs $50 per month.\n\nI opened DRPs for my kids, for our grand niece, and for ourselves.\n\nYou can sort of figure out if a company offers a DRP.  Go to their website and look for a tab that says \"Investors\", \"Investor Relations\", \"Shareowner Services\", etc.  This could be at the top of their home page or at the bottom of their home page.\n\nExample\n\n[https://www.analog.com/en/index.html](https://www.amwater.com)\n\ngo to the bottom of the home page\n\nIn the middle left, there will be \"Investor Relations\"\n\ngo to the Contact Us\n\nlook for Transfer Agent\n\nthen you will see a link that puts you to the third party that allows you to create a DRP in Analog Device.\n\nAnother way is to just open a mutual fund that invests in a basket of stocks, to reduce the risk of owning one stock.  Mutual fund is the same way, you give them money each month, they buy shares of the mutual fund, and that fund then buys shares of companies.\n\nYou can find mutual funds that specialize in certain fields, such as electric vehicles or gold or oil and gas or whatever.",

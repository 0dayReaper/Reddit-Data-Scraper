    "postText": "I'm a female in my late 20s and have 20K in my checking account. I'm unsure about how to invest the money. I attempted to sign up for the Chase bonus for new savings account users, but I was ineligible because I already have the money in a checking account with them. My goal is to save up for a down payment. However, I'm not sure I'll buy a house soon, but I plan to do so within the next two years.\r  \n\r  \nI don't have any debt, and I own my car. I am also putting 18% of my biweekly paychecks towards my 403B and maxing out my HSA. I have been looking into a HYSA account or a Roth IRA. Do you have any suggestions?",

Besides the obvious better interest rate is there any gotchas ? The HYSA I have has NO fees for withdrawals or deposits or maintenance.",

Do that first if not.\n\nBut for the 20k, I wouldn't put it into an IRA if there's a chance you'll need it within 5 years; you'll have to pay taxes if you need it before then. There's an exception for buying a home but you'll only be able to access up to 10k and you're likely going to need more than that. I guess this rule only applies to earnings not contributions. But personally I just wouldn't want to be messing with taking money out of that account so I tend to put only what I expect to be able to keep long-term in my IRA.\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/waitingperiodroth.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/05/waitingperiodroth.asp)\n\nI'm putting my down payment money in a Money Market fund right now (probably want gov backed funds rather than the other two kinds).\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N53wZ\\_80abU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N53wZ_80abU)",

Big question/advice needed is if I should pay it off in full or invest/pay off slower?\n\nExpenses: No rent (live with parents) so basically food/travel + have a 15 year old car that's on its last legs and will have to think about getting a new one\n\nSavings: 150K (for loans) + 50K for emergency - has been in a HYSA\n\nIncome: I quit my old job (averaged 80 hours a week with extreme stress) and took a pay cut to about 70K (pre-tax).\n\nLoans: 150K student loans (Federal at 6% and currently paused but starting again soon) - no CC or any other debt.\n\nThank you all - really appreciate the help!",

Once you have ended your debt your options will open up immediately to save and invest more aggressively for other endeavors. A mortgage is the only debt you should ever have to carry. Every other consumer debt is dead weight. Plus paying them off will free up more cash for your monthly budget.",

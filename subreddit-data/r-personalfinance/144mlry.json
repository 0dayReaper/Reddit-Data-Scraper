    "postText": "So I bought a 1 bedroom condo back in 2019 in Waterdown, ON Canada for $303K and after 4 years it's finally built. \n\nI'm going through all the closing fees the lawyer sent over and the first fee that shows up is something called \"additional consideration\" and it's $31K..... That's a pretty massive chunk of money and floored that was thrown on there amongst everything else. \n\nIs this normal? Do I have to pay this? \n\nThanks in advance for your help.",

    "postText": "Everything I can see online says JEPI is a low risk fund. It invests in stable large cap stocks and does some options trading to provide periodic income\n \n\nBut somehow, Fidelity asked me to acknowledge a warning saying I understand it is high risk when trying to invest in it. What am I missing?",

            "comment": "If you're young, don't invest in JEPI or any covered call ETF. You are severely capping your investments upside potential. Covered call ETFs were meant for retirees who want to supplement their pensions and social security without selling off their investments. Stick with a fund that tracks the SP500 for growth over time. After you retire then invest the contributions and earnings into JEPI for the monthly dividends. SPY, VOO, VTI, SCHD have blown away JEPI in annual returns. \n\nDon't invest JEPI in your taxable account. Covered call dividends are taxed as ordinary income. Invest JEPI and other covered call ETFs in your Roth IRA or HSA to minimize taxes.",

    "postText": "Hi all. \n\nCurrently 29 making 80k before taxes, around 66k after. I contribute 6% to my 401k, and my company matches. I currently only have around 33k in my current 401k, and around $2k in my company\u2019s pension plan. There are no contributions here, the company automatically contributes 2% of my salary annually. \n\nSince I\u2019m not really where I should be, should I look at contributing more into my 401k? Should I open an IRA and contribute to that in addition to my 401k? \n\nIn terms of what I have to contribute, I have roughly ~4k a month after bills and other expenses. I don\u2019t have an emergency fund (it was used for emergency medical bills) so I would think I need to build that back up first? \n\nThanks for all the advice.",

You have excess money leftover after covering needs that isn't currently going into those retirement accounts.\n\nPut however much of that you comfortably can into the retirement accounts until you're happy with where they sit.",

An IRA is and individual retirement account that you open by yourself and based on brokerage you can invest in a lot more such as individual stocks or ETF\u2019s. There is something like 5000+ stocks, you only get access to handful of mutual funds in your 401K but IRA you would have access to majority of the stocks. Other investment options can include real estate and other stuff.",

You can contribute up to $22,500/year in your 401(k), reducing your tax burden. You can contribute up to $6,500/year into an IRA. The total contribution would be $2,416/month, which would still leave you with an extra $1,600/month in savings to build up an emergency fund. Perhaps wait until you\u2019ve built up your emergency fund to a comfortable level, but it seems like you would really be able to accelerate your retirement savings without impacting your QOL.",

Warren Buffet\u2019s advice. \n\nOpening a Roth IRA is a good idea. but I would wait on this until you build up your emergency savings fund. You can only contribute $6500 a year and you have until April of next year to contribute for the current year. \n\nI would recommend Contributing more to your 401K now.. While still building up your emergency savings fund. As your contributions to your 401K will lower your current tax bill. I would up your contributions to 10-12% at a minimum. \n\nFinally. Probably TMI. Retirement is a long way off. Are you saving for a home? Shorter-term expenses. Wasn\u2019t your question, and Roth IRA contributions can be used for these.  But a brokerage account is made for these expenses. Also brokerage accounts can fund an early retirement. As 401K have tax penalties for taking money out before age 55 and IRAs before age 59.5.  \n\nFood for thought once you build back up your emergency savings fund. \n\nGood luck!",

Just set it and forget it even during market corrections until you retire. Consider a Roth 401K if your company has this option. \n\nOpen up and max out a Roth IRA. There is a book you can borrow from your local library. The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle. This book was written for beginner investors emphasizing investing in broad market ETFs like VTI or VOO for their simplicity. Just set it and forget it even during market corrections until you retire. Broad market ETFs for the win.\n\nIf you have extra money, gradually increase your 401 K to it's max of $22500 if you're comfortable with your monthly budget.",

One technique to do it over time is to increase it every time you get a raise by 1% until you are maxing it out.\n\nIf it is any consolation I had a negative net worth when I was 29 with $0 in my 401k because I moved to the US from Canada broke but like you had a decent job.  So I was behind like you but I caught up eventually (in 50s).  My advice:  Consistency is the key.   And never ever borrow from your 401k.\n\nI personally only started looking at ROTHs after I maxed out 401k which was when I was in my mid 40s.  It took me a while because I focused on 529 plan for a while which I am glad I did as well.",

That\u2019s just not possible for many, so you do what you can.\n\nThere\u2019s no advantage of a regular IRA over a 401k except more investment options. If you opened a Roth IRA, you could set a little after-tax money aside there as well as your 401k. However, just adding your 401k is fine too. which is better really depends on how much tax you pay now, and how much you predict you\u2019ll pay in retirement (the latter part being particularly tricky to estimate).\n\nMake sure you also have an emergency fund of easily accessible cash for emergencies (3-6 months of expenses).\n\nYou probably want to invest some money for future non-retirement expenses like a car, house, etc. You don\u2019t want to dip into your retirement for big expenses in the future.",

I have a Schwab IRA and I invest in index funds that charge around 0.02  to 0.05 percent in fees.  If your 401k doesn't have index funds with fees that low, then open an IRA at Schwab, Fidelity, or Vanguard and invest in a low cost index fund.",

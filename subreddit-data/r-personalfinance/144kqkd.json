    "postText": "I ordered a new car last month but it won\u2019t be built till end of this year which works out great since i\u2019m in no rush. I was curious since I\u2019m trading in my current vehicle, would it be better to pay extra towards my principal on what I still owe left on it or should I just pay what I usually pay and put the cash towards a bigger down payment? Does it make a difference? does it look better to have to bigger down payment + trade in, or bigger trade in + smaller down payment. Does it matter? I already have quite a bit of equity on my current car already if that matters really. \n\n\nNot sure if that made much sense, but if it did any answers are appreciated.",

    "postText": "Hello. I\u2019m 25 years old. I make $91k a year base, but can easily pull more with some extra work. I\u2019m on pace to do $110k this year currently. My daily driver recently finally died after 280k miles. I\u2019m looking at a brand new car (Honda Civic Hatchback) that costs right at $33k before tax/fees. Top trim. \n\nTake home is about $4600 a month. This is assuming I work just the base amount. It is very easy to bring in extra if I want. For context, I will take home $7600 this month and only worked an extra 5 days this month and after that, I still have 14 days off this month. \n\nI have no other debt. Currently right under 30k in retirement and I do 12% to my 401k with a 3% additional match from my employer. Roth IRA already maxed. Rent and utilities is right under $1000 a month (I live and split with my girlfriend). I also own another car, an unpractical for the most part 2016 Mustang GT that is paid off. No intention of selling currently. I want a practical daily driver to go along this car. \n\nI plan on putting down 12-15k, 48 month loan. I\u2019m estimating around a $570 a month payment at 3.9% APR if I do 48 month loan with a 12k downpayment. \n\nI think I know deep down I can easily do it. I\u2019m just getting cold feet and sick thinking about it because I am decently frugal and view that that $570 each month as money I could be using for other fun stuff. Not to mention all the Dave Ramseys and everyone always talking about how terrible car payments are no matter the income. But at the same time I drove a beater for so long and think it\u2019s time for something nice. \n\nJust need some opinions.",

You have the fun car, why pay 33k for a civic? You can easily find something as a daily for way less. If you need to go new, the sport (which I have) is very nice. Sonic grey pearl gets compliments every day, but I get out of it and laugh cause it\u2019s a civic. It\u2019s a basic car. Don\u2019t spend 33k on a car that you aren\u2019t having ~fun~ in.",

You can find a sport for 25-6k, save that 7-8k and have some extra pocket change. We seem to be in similar situations. I\u2019m 26 with a large savings, good job, and no debt. This is just what I would do! \n\nAs for the v8 muscle, I\u2019m torn. I drove an SS Camaro yesterday for shits and giggles on the lot near me. It was amazing. I\u2019m not sure how long the wait will be on a 24 gt, I would probably go with that in a perfect world, but that could be a whole year away at this point. I\u2019m impatient and need that v8 in my life lol. How you like the stang?",

Haven\u2019t done much to it, just wheels and tires (previous owner put off-road X Pipe, SLP Loudmouth axle backs and a resonator delete so it sounded good when I got it). Thinking about getting some long tubes for it. But whatever you get, I\u2019d get a manual. The A10s in the newer Mustangs are so damn quick and very impressive but rowing through the gears and downshifting/rev matching in a V8 muscle car is just so much fun. In fact if I do get one of these Civic hatches, one of my absolute requirements is a manual transmission.",

Go to some online places like Ally or Capital One.  Go to your bank.  Get your best rate.  Take that to the dealer.  See what rate they offer.  If they beat it, that's great!\n\nA couple of cars ago, I got a rate that was something like 3.5% from Capital One online (which was very good at the time).  When I went to the dealer, they offered me 5% or something.  I said pound sand.  They then offered to beat whatever financing I had.  Then like magic they came in at 3.25%.",

I trust Honda and Toyota and won\u2019t fall into the \u201cused cars are unreliable\u201d trap\u2026 but still spending that much for a way old used car with that many miles is a hard pill to swallow. As far a few years used go, those Civics are still 25-27k. For a 2-5 year old car with miles and the last generation of Civic technology.",

    "postText": "Hi Everyone,\n\nI had to setup an account with BofA, that has Zelle as a core function for transfers. Because of the nature of this account, there isn't an associated debit card. Just checks or digital transfer. My banker said: \"just zelle yourself money to another account if you need to, easy\". - But my Zelle is already associated to this other account, and you can only have one associated at a time.\n\nIs there a way around this? I need to send it to chase, and preferably instantly if at all possible.\n\nTrying to figure out a way to transfer money from this BofA account to Chase instantly, without extra fees, and without having to wait 5 days for an external transfer inside chase itself.\n\nThank you!!!!",

Only issue is the one makes it hard to initiate because you can only send to saved contacts,  and I can't save the og email because it's my contact email on that bank and throws an error. So I just request from my main account and accept on that account.",

All three banks I use have it in their apps, so I don't actually know much about the actual zelle app. I log into Bank A, request from Bank B, log into Bank B and accept, then log into Bank C and send to Bank A to get all my funds together when I need to. I think BOA has it built into their app as well so you should be able to sign up and send.",

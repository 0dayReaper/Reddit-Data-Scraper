    "postText": "Interim Equifax CEO\u2019s Message in Wall Street Journal:\n\nOn behalf of Equifax , I want to express my sincere and total apology to every consumer affected by our recent data breach. People across the country and around the world, including our friends and family members, put their trust in our company. We didn\u2019t live up to expectations.\n\nWe were hacked. That\u2019s the simple fact. But we compounded the problem with insufficient support for consumers. Our website did not function as it should have, and our call center couldn\u2019t manage the volume of calls we received. Answers to key consumer questions were too often delayed, incomplete or both. We know it\u2019s our job to earn back your trust.\n\nWe will act quickly and forcefully to correct our mistakes, while simultaneously developing a new approach to protecting consumer data. In the near term, our responsibility is to provide timely, reassuring support to every affected consumer. Our longer-term plan is to give consumers the power to protect and control access to their personal credit data.\n\nI was appointed Equifax\u2019s interim chief executive officer on Tuesday. I won\u2019t pretend to have figured out all the answers in two days. But I have been listening carefully to consumers and critics. I have heard the frustration and fear. I know we have to do a better job of helping you.\n\nAlthough we have made mistakes, we have successfully managed a tremendous volume of calls and clicks. And we\u2019re getting better each day. But it\u2019s not enough. I\u2019ve told our team we have to do whatever it takes to upgrade the website and improve the call centers.\n\nWe have started work on our website, and I see significant signs of progress. I won\u2019t accept anything less than a superior process for consumers. We will make this site right or we will build another one from scratch. You have my word.\n\nThe same goes for the call centers. There is no excuse for delayed calls or agents who can\u2019t answer key questions. We will add agents and expand training until calls are answered promptly and knowledgeably. I will personally review a daily report on their operations.\n\nWe will also extend the services we are offering consumers. We have heard your concern that the window to sign up for free credit freezes with Equifax is too brief, so we are extending the deadline to the end of January. Likewise, we are extending the sign-up period for TrustedID Premier, the complimentary package we are offering all U.S. consumers, through the end of January.\n\nWe hope these immediate actions will go a long way toward addressing the concerns we are hearing from consumers. We know they won\u2019t solve the larger problem. We have to see this breach as a turning point\u2014not just for Equifax, but for everyone interested in protecting personal data. Consumers need the power to control access to personal data.\n\nCritics will say we are late to the party. But we have been studying and developing a potential solution for some time, as have others. Now it is time to act.\n\nSo here is our commitment: By Jan. 31, Equifax will offer a new service allowing all consumers the option of controlling access to their personal credit data. The service we are developing will let consumers easily lock and unlock access to their Equifax credit files. You will be able to do this at will. It will be reliable, safe and simple. Most significantly, the service will be offered free, for life.\n\nWith the extension of the complimentary TrustedID package and free credit freezes into the new year, combined with the introduction of this new service by the end of January, we will be able to offer consumers both short- and long-term support for their personal data security.\n\nThere is no magic cure for data breaches. As we all know, every organization is at risk. When consumers have access to our new service, however, the cybercrime business will become a lot more difficult, and we are committed to doing what we can to help millions of consumers rest easier.\n\nMr. Rego Barros is interim CEO of Equifax.",

They are not making money from you, rather they make money off of you. You are a resource to them, not a customer. Their business goal is to protect companies from losing money. They don't care about you, they just see you as a source of information. They are like farmers growing crops without caring for the land. They act like all that matters is that someone will buy the crops, not the quality or health of the land which grows the crops. It's what happens when immediate profits are top priority, even above safety or planning for the future. From the point of view of protecting loan-givers from losing money, it's a legitimate business practice. The problem is not their business model itself, but the irresponsible way it was implemented.

                            "comment": "There is a ton of misinformation spreading here. Here's what I've been able to gather. A lock and freeze effectively do the same thing - it prevents anyone from pulling your credit report or trying to open new credit in your name. Locks can be triggered by signing up for online services with the 3 credit bureaus (sounds like equifax is going to be free, experian has a cost, and transunion is free) after an online identity verification. You can lock or unlock your credit report online \"instantly\" after logging in (you can put in the request instantly, however, behind the scenes it might take some time to take effect - read the fine print). However, a freeze requires you to know a special PIN to unlock it which is typically sent via snail mail. It is much less convenient (especially if you forget the PIN I imagine) but likely more secure. \n\nSource on freeze vs. lock: https://www.lexingtonlaw.com/credit-repair-news/credit-repair-news/whats-the-difference-between-a-fraud-alert-security-freeze-and-credit-lock.html\n\nOkay, now it's rant time. Why all three credit bureaus are not legally required to offer free locking/unlocking services to consumers is beyond me and unbelievable. I sincerely hope this breach triggers legislation around requiring this ability for free, or that the last hold out (Experian) turns their service free as well. It's seriously enraging that these credit bureaus hold so much power, the consumer has no choice in this, but they aren't prohibited to charge you to take such a basic protection measure as being able to easily say \"I'm not applying for new credit, so don't let anyone try until I say so\" which should be a DEFAULT state for 99% of people. \n\nEdit: Separated my useful info from my rant, and added a source. Please try to stop guessing at information, or if you think I'm wrong, reply and cite a source. There is a lot of misinformation spreading (or at least I believe so from my research), so please cite your source if I'm incorrect on this.",

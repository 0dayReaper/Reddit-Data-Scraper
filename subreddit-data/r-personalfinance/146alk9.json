    "postText": "I have been debating what is the best investment which would be good for &lt;5 years approx. \nI am looking into high yield savings accounts and CDs and also treasure I Bonds. \n\nAre there more options or better options if I have about 20k to invest?\n\n\nEdit: Original post was a bit vague. Some more details below.\n\n\nI do plan on buying a house in the next 5 years and hence would like to currently keep investing in something which should give decent returns in 5 years time.\n\nHence the options I listed seem that way.\n\nI graduated and am working since 5 years now. Currently I make about 120k and have no debt except paying off my car loan (700 monthly)\n\nAnd of course spend on rent per month which is about 1400.\nI do try to save as much as possible and I think I have enough in my emergency fund to start looking at investing all extra money saved per month.\nI do have a HSA and a 401k which I do not touch ever.. \n\nI don't like the stock market as much as I have been bitten by it in the past and hence looking for more \"stable\" forms of investing..",

            "comment": "Long term (meaning money not needed for 5+ years) should be invested in the stock market.  That money I have invested in broad market index funds split 70/30 between total US and international.  If you want bonds you can make it 60/30/10.\n\nFor short term savings, I have my cash saved in a mixture of high yield savings, money market funds, treasury bills and the occasional new account bonus.\n\nMy high yield savings is earning 4.15%, while my money market funds are earning 4.9%.  My various treasury bills are earning around 5.05% to 5.3%.  When I do new bank account bonuses, depending on the institutions base interest rate, I'm earning roughly around 8% APY for the 90 or so days I need to keep it there.\n\nI also have some iBonds, but I would recommend not buying iBonds now as their composite rate is close to where treasury bills are and if inflation goes down then the rate on iBonds will also go down.",

    "postText": "A month ago on a Friday my dog had emergency surgery and I paid 8k on my credit card with a 12k limit. My wife told me to use the credit card instead of debit card to get the points from such a big charge.\n\nSince it was over a weekend the charge didnt post on my account until the following week, and then I immediately paid it off 100% because I didn\u2019t want it dinging my credit card usage. But it\u2019s a month later and my score dropped 45 points from 790 to 745. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid.\n\nWhen will my score go back up? My balance is only $400 now from everyday purchases and I can easily pay it off. Is there anything I can do? It sucks because Im looking at buying a car soon.",

Most report the statement balance, [some report](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/credit-utilization-reporting-dates-for-each-card-issuer/) on 1st, 2nd weekend, or last day. This is the only day each month where balance matters for credit score.\n\nAlso, which credit score did you see? AFAIK, only FICO 10 tracks utilization trends. Previous versions don't keep a history of utilizations.",

Score should go back to normal after the next time that card reports to the bureaus (usually around the statement date, but could be different).\n\nIf it reported a $0 balance and you normally report a small balance, this might be the cause of the drop.  Look up \"all zero except one\" (AZEO)",

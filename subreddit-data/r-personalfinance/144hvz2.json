    "postText": "I've been using the Acorns app that takes leftover change from all my purchases and moves it to an investment account. It's cool and it's been a fun place to park a little extra cash, but for the past 2 years I've only lost money (low returns and not enough money invested, so it's not making up for the $5 / month fee). \n\nAre there similar apps that:\n\n* Are free\n* Move money to a high-yield savings account OR historically have decent investment returns (I'd like to make at least 2% on it)\n\nI've done some Googling and Chime seems like a good fit. Just wanted to see what else is out there.",

Now I think it would only be a decent option if you start with a lot more cash to invest.",

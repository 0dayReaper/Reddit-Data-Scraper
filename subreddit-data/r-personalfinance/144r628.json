    "postText": "I walked into this T-Mobile store in a upscale mall to get a new phone. They checked my credit and it came back as it is locked (I have my credit locked at the credit bureaus - so no surprises there). Then agent in the store called a support number and talked. Eventually he asked me to talk. The person on the other side of the phone asked for all my details (address, birthdate, full SSN) etc\u2026 I gave all that without hesitation. They told the same as the store associate (credit freeze). \n\n\nAfter walking out, I now have doubts about whether I should have given the details. \n\nAm I being paranoid or really in trouble (with regards to identity theft)?",

Most of the time customer service for any company is typically required to ask you for certain info just to confirm they're speaking to the correct person before divulging any sensitive info themselves.",

It kinda of defeats the purpose of the credit freeze, if any company could just access your credit just by you giving them your info. The process is through the credit bureaus directly.\n\nNext time, you go home or somewhere secure, unfreeze your credit, then you can go back or they might even have given you the support phone number to complete the process yourself without having to go back to the store.",

In fact if I copied a social even on accident with a click or control-c I could get fired if qa caught it.\nIf that makes you feel any better lol. Plus the sheer volume of people's info customer service agents have to take means that they aren't like robbing everyone the instant someone gives you their social. \n\nYou are more than likely fine",

    "postText": "My brother added me as an authorized user on his credit card 7 years ago. This is the card with the longest credit history. My other cards have only been opened/added recently, with the oldest being 1 year, and others 4 months. I also have 25k in student loan debt if that\u2019s relevant. My current score is 677 (according to Credit Karma) and has improved these past few months because of my newer cards. \n\nMy brothers card is maxed out (17k) and I think it\u2019s holding my score down (correct me if I\u2019m wrong). Before this high credit usage, my score was about 780. If I asked my brother to remove me as an authorized user, would that hurt my score (because it\u2019s my longest credit history)? Or would it improve my score (because the % of credit card usage of the limit would lower)?",

I think you have to look at it long term in regards to your brothers situation and his ability to pay his debt off as well since you're currently attached to it.",

    "postText": "\r  \n\r  \nAbout 8 months ago, my car was totaled. I'm lucky enough to have a job now where I travel a lot. However, most of my recent work has been local, so I'm required to have my own transportation so my company doesn't rent me a car.\r  \n\r  \nFor the past 5 months, I've been renting through Avis doing month to month rentals at about 1200 a month. I have an Acura TLX because that's all they had at the time. I got VERY lucky and they've been billing me for a subcompact this whole time. But the gravy train has run out.\r  \n\r  \nOn 6/19, I have to return the car because that's when my rental is up, and I can't renew it because it has a ton of miles on it now so they can't re rent it to me. They'll actually give me a subcompact this time. No way in HELL am I gonna rent a Mitsubishi Mirage or Yaris or something for 1200 a month.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, I only have about $1000 in savings. I really really do not want to rent again and this time actually get a subcompact car.\r  \n\r  \nMy credit score is around 630. I make about $4500-$5000 a month. Debt to income is zero.But I don't have a few grand to put down on a finance or lease. I'm stuck in this purgatory.\r  \n\r  \nWhat the hell do I do? I don't want to try to take out a super shit subprime personal loan that I'll end up paying 2-3x on just to get into a finance / lease. I don't want to go to some buy here pay here and get a used shit box for 0 down.",

Once you are done paying the beater start saving money towards a better car.\n\nUsing your \"gravy train\" $1,200 a month moneys you should find a pretty decent beater for $10k, which should be paid off in less than a year. From there $1,200 a month should net you $14k+ per year. If you get two years out of your beater car you can afford quite the nice car at the end of that rainbow.",

Any unexpected expense would put you in a bad situation. First, you should evaluate your budget and spending. If you're making $5500/mo, then where is the money going?\n\nBut if you need a car now, buy the cheapest car you can safely drive. There are plenty of options for under $4k. No, they aren't luxurious, but they'll work. If you maintain it well, you might be able to get 6 or 8 years or if it. Get one with no reported accidents. Try to get a mechanic to look at it before you buy it.\n\nBut get your own financing. You can probably find a credit union that will give you a loan for under 12% interest in your situation. Do not get a car on a loan with 20%+ interest. Try to avoid a long term on the loan for this car. You don't want to have it crap out on you with 4 years still left on the loan.\n\nA $4k loan at 12% interest for 36 months will work out to about $160/mo. You should be able to get insurance for about $80/mo. Way cheaper than the rental you're doing now. \n\nAs you save money, in a few years, you should be able to afford something newer and nicer. But for now, be very realistic and honest with yourself about what you need/can afford, rather than what you can convince yourself you need/deserve.",

Not having a car payment (or a very small one) is more of a luxury than driving a car that costs 600+ a month to drive. Having more income will always feel better than having \"luxury\" items.",

OP was fine paying 1200 a month for an Acura sedan to drive a \u201cluxury car\u201d. Too many people can\u2019t see the forest through the trees and if he would instead save that 1200 a month for a year or two, he\u2019d have plenty of cash for either a great down payment on a new car he\u2019s not renting, or a decent used car that will get him to and from.\nSome posts in the sub and the responses OPs have to legitimately helpful financial advice make me feel so lucky my parents instilled good financial/credit sense in me from an early age. Some people will never get off the debt wheel",

    "postText": "This is a post about how even a little bit of attention can go a long way for you, and others. \n\nI work for a company with ~600 employees across North America. Since finding the personal finance communities two years ago, my family has been keeping an eye on our budgeting and saving, and I was having fun with it, so I started also keeping track of contributions into my 401k - nothing major, just a yearly look to see contributions, matches (my company matches 4%), and dividends.\n\nOne year I logged into my 401k provider (Fidelity) and ran my transaction history total for a year, and what caught my eye was a Fee for $12.50. To that date I had never seen a fee before. I called my HR/Benefits and they confirmed they had jumped the gun but that - starting next year - every employee would have a $12.50 recordkeeping fee charged yearly. They reimbursed me the $12.50 for that year, but I learned a lesson: 401ks (and the HR departments behind a company) were not infallible.  I added 'Fees' to my mental thing to check on during my year-end check.\n\n2 years went by, until this last year. This year in February I pulled the 2018 totals for my 401k, and noticed that my contribution and my year-end total seemed off, by about $150 or so. I couldn't figure it out. Finally, I went to the transaction history of my 401k and looked through it. And there I saw it: a company **match** of *negative* $153.95, back in March. It was the strangest thing! It wasn't tied to any actual contribution; it was just sitting out there, all by itself. It wasn't even listed under 'Fees'. It was just a *negative* company match. (Shout out to everyone who has ever complained about their company match or lack thereof - at least you've never had a *negative* one!) And I knew it wasn't just those dollars I was missing - it was all those dollars that those dollars were going to make, and the dollars *those* dollars would make, for decades to come. \n\nI started asking around. My HR department said there were no reported problems and that if I wanted a detailed walkthrough of my 401k contributions, I could wait two weeks until I had a meeting with the benefits coordinator. I said, 'Schedule it'. But I didn't stop there. I started asking my coworkers, and guess what - *everyone* had a negative company match on that date. I had 5 confirmed cases, then 10, then 20. The amounts all varied, but it was always on the same March date. \n\nBy this point I got enough people riled up that I ended up talking to the head of Benefits, who confirmed that, okay, maybe there was a problem. It took 2 months for them to confirm, at which point we found out that a payroll 'true-up' calculation had incorrectly counted a week that crossed from year-to-year as two weeks, and then had automatically 'corrected' for the doubled amount. It took 2 more months for them to finally correct it. I'm sure some of my coworkers contribute less and some contribute way more, but 600 employees * $153.95 = $92,370.  Meaning that every person in the company had a hand in some $92000 missing from their 401k... but I was the only one who had bothered to check. \n\nI know most people don't ever calculate out their paycheck or look at their 401k. And I'm not saying you should on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis. But every once in a while, take 5 or 10 minutes and grab that paper copy of your paycheck, or hit that 'Forgot password' button, log on to your system, and take a little look over how much money you're getting - be it paycheck, 401k, or whatever - and see whether it makes sense to you. You might be surprised what you find.\n\n\nEDIT 1: Wow, I return from work to see this has blown up!! Thank you for all the great insights and feedback - if just one person improves their path to better finances, I'll be happy!",

To their credit, HR immediately investigated.\n\nTurned out that in working in a spreadsheet to calculate the contributions, a clueless Excel user had deleted a cell when they meant to delete an entire row. As a result, everyone in the latter two-thirds of the alphabet was credited with the contribution for the person in the row below them.\n\nIn a company of several thousand employees I was the only one who had noticed.",

My current supervisor recently realized she hasn't been contributing to her 401k- she just always assumed it was automatically deducted from her paycheck.  \n\nThe way our company's 401k match works, we only get to keep what they match if we stay with the company for 3 years after we enroll in our 401k plan (not 3 years from one's start of employment). So now, although she's worked here for 4 years and would've been able to keep what had been matched if she had actually contributed to the 401k plan, she's lost out on all of it. Even more frustratingly, now if she wants to keep any matches they make on her 401k she'll have to stay at our company for 3 more years, and she was trying to leave in the next year or two. So basically because she never double-checked whether she was actually contributing to her 401k she's going to miss out on 4-5 years of employer matching and there's no possibility she gets any match money now unless she stays in this job longer than she was planning to.",

I asked HR if I\u2019d still get my full match if I hit the cap early before end of year and would months after match? They didn\u2019t know, our CFO didn\u2019t know, no one knew and they had to research. Come to find out that yeah I\u2019d still get my money as they were currently looking st the match being for the overall year BUT they had some changes on the way that would indeed mean that in following years I wouldn\u2019t get the match so I had to scale back contributions. No one in my company had ever thought of this and when asked no one knew the answer until they reached out to our large provider! People in general really don\u2019t pay much attention to this stuff and near as I can tell, using tools my current provider gives us to compare with peers, no one is really contributing either! \ud83d\ude31",

This was when caps were lower and at that company I could contribute whatever percentage I wanted. \n\nI moved to a new larger company and couldn\u2019t go more than 10% so didn\u2019t hit the cap for YEARS until recently that number was lifted. I mentioned this to an HR person I know from another company and they couldn\u2019t believe we were stuck at 10% so I did some digging... Seems if you work for a company where a large number of \u201chighly paid\u201d employees work and not enough lower paid employees participate in the 401k the company is penalized with a cap. We had that cap for at least 18 years \ud83d\ude44 I guess it\u2019s just another indication of how bad the savings for retirement are in this country and it bugs me I wasn\u2019t able to put in as much as I wanted, I was too lazy to do IRA so I guess I had problems too \ud83d\ude02",

I worked for a specific company for 6 years straight and put half my investments in the auto invest target date fund and the other half in my own investment mix based on my somewhat limited knowledge of stocks in the day to day. When I left that job I'd made about 8% annually with premix target date and 9.5% annually with my own choices. Both options decent return, notably better than bonds or CD savings but most would say it isn't really worth the manual effort unless you are going to put real time into it and adjust investments regularly with market fluctuations.",

It's to automatically change your risk profile over time. So if you're young now, you can take on more risk because you have time to wait out market fluctuations, so your target date fund with date out at your retirement date would have higher risk funds in it like small cap, international and other indexes like that right now. And over time that same fund would do the work for you to reduce your risk profile by selling those higher risk funds and buying more lower risk funds in corporate and govt bonds etc. You could expect to get the same performance as the target date funds if you're willing to adjust that mix yourself each year but for lazy people like me who don't care to monitor it so closely, the target date funds help make sure you're staying properly diversified at appropriate risk levels.",

But as someone mentioned already, a plan that large will be audited, and that should be caught. Also, Fidelity and most huge outfits like it are notorious for making errors like this. But also- just as an educational aside- it is possible to have a negative match true-up. It is also possible this is a correction of an over-contribution error made earlier. In many 401(k) plans, the match is calculated on an annual basis. However many payrolls will only support a per-payroll calculation. This can cause a discrepancy, especially if someone has started/stopped/changed his/her deferral election in the year and the match is made with each payroll. Anyway, it is possible this is not at error. But it sounds in this case, with so many affected, that it was. Best of luck getting it resolved!\n\nEdited: to say- hardly anyone looks at the details of their 401(k) accounts.",

Basically, for 401(k)s, any violations to the sponsor side are usually due to \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d violations. ERISA law mandates that companies don\u2019t have to provide a retirement plan, but if they do, they better damn well treat everybody the same. That is, the CFO\u2019s friend Bob can\u2019t get a 3% match, while they give you and everyone else 2%, because they like you less. If your contribution was made on time, and the Sponsor fucked up their reporting of it; usually because they have zero idea how to upload a payroll file to a website, then they have to make it right. Usually, they do not need to calculate gains or losses because it\u2019s caught in time. Sometimes, people are so dumb they don\u2019t catch it for years. That means that the 17% stock market return for this year isn\u2019t being calculated on something that you (usually) has taken out of your paycheck. ERISA rightfully says, the Sponsor (employer) has to make it right, along with gains and losses, because the client would otherwise be out those returns and Bob, who is also in the 401(k) plan, realized his returns. That is, you\u2019re entitled to your returns just like he is. ISN\u2019T EQUALITY GREAT?\n\nHaving said that, there are many loopholes and nuances in place that allow the business owners to fuck their employees. See me, who\u2019s playing 1%+ in fees in their 401(k), because the participant disclosure didn\u2019t mention the FA was collecting 1% annually from the participants in the plan.",

            "comment": "Wanted to summarize some points that were already made and clarify a few things related to this post/topic that are commonly misunderstood.  **Yes everyone should 100% watch and reconcile their 401(k) accounts closely - contribution errors and vesting errors are extremely common and happen all the time.**  \n\nTLDR below:  explained some of the terms and how a few things work.    \n\n**Timeliness of posting Employee Contributions:**  EE contributions must be deposited into the 401(k) *as soon as reasonably and administratively possible.*    As was pointed out by  u/windycitylvr there was an old rule which was referred to as the \"15 day funding rule\" which has not been in effect since early 2000's.\n\n**Employer sources:**   A qualified plan can have multiple types of employer contributions.   \n\n* The common ER contribution is the employer match which is \"x% match of the first x% of your contributions, based on eligible compensation\" e.g. 100% match of the first 3-5% is common.   \n* The second common ER contribution type is a profit sharing match.   This is a discretionary match and the employer can decide or not decide to make this contribution, but if the ER decides to make the contribution, it must be distributed fairly.\n* The third common ER contribution type is a non-elective contribution, commonly referred to as a \"Company Match\".  This type of contribution is made to the plan regardless of you contribute or not - you only need to be eligible to participate in the plan.    Generally these are setup as a percentage of your eligible compensation.  Example 2% of your compensation for the first 5 years, then 3% thereafter.      \n* There are many other types (QNEC's, QVEC's, QMAC's, Money Purchase) etc, but the above contribution types are most common.\n\n**Plan Errors:**  The type of error that the plan made described above is a plan error, and the correction must be corrected under EPCRS.  There are different correction types (Voluntary correction program requires IRS permission to proceed, the Self-correction program does not require the proposed correction to be vetted with the IRS first).  In all cases EPCRS corrections **always** require earnings to be credited to the participant account.   Earnings in this case would be to credit the account as-of the date it was supposed to be credited with market appreciation and dividends included to the present date based on the investment direction the participant had at the as-of date.   With respect to this issue, it would likely be corrected under SCP.\n\n**True Up Match** \\-  This is a completely normal activity that generally would post to your account sometime near the beginning of each year.   Employer match contributions in most cases need to be trued-up shortly after the plan year end.   For example, if you make 120,000 and your deferral rate is 40%, you  will hit your contribution limit in May and will no longer be able to contribute for the rest of the year.    If the employer match is 100% of the first 5%, from January to May you would  receive an employer contribution on the first 5% of your contribution, which would be $250 each payroll period if you are paid semi-monthly.....    After may, when you hit your annual limit, there is no more employer match.    If your deferral rate is 16%, you would hit your deferral limit at the end of the year, and each employer match throughout the year would be $250.    The true-up match makes this fair, crediting the participant with employer contributions they are entitled to based on your full year activity.   This confuses everybody, participants and employers.\n\n**Recordkeeping Fees:**  If you are in a 401(k) plan, you must receive an annual fee disclosure, written in plain english, which is also known as the 408(b)2 Notice.    This will list out all the direct and indirect fees that you are paying.  Indirect fees are what is wrapped in the investments (e.g. mutual fund expenses) and what you are charged directly for.      Plan's pay their fees a number of ways, but generally a quarterly recordkeeping fee in the $10-30 range is reasonable.     Keep in mind, it is administratively expensive and complex to run these plans and comply with all the regulations.      From most peoples perspective, it is clearer to pay a fixed quarterly fee directly, rather then to have your recordkeeping expenses paid for out of mutual fund revenue which is much less clear to the participant. \n\n**Negative Contributions:**  Yes, these do happen, and every auditor/compliance officer/lawyer has a different perspective on how kosher these are.   The most common type of negative contribution is a result of a payroll error.  E.g. if  you were over paid on a pay period for whatever reason, and your payroll needed to be adjusted, a negative contribution could be posted to correct the payroll error.\n\nFinally with respect to the specific error, and how it could have occurred.     All plans have a Plan Year End (commonly 12/31) and a Calendar Year End (always 12/31).    At the year end the recordkeeper needs to update their systems and data for the new year (e.g. zero out your YTD contributions, update your hours for vesting calculations, flag future contributions for the next year so they show up on the right 5500, etc).    This is usually called the year end roll.      **Tons of errors happen here** usually because the plan sponsor or their payroll provider makes an innocent mistake that they don't understand will have consequences.  For example if you get paid at the end of the month, and your contributions are posted at the beginning of the next month, at year end that january contribution must be flagged into the correct year.    True-up matches must also be properly flagged in the correct year.",

If the employee is not deferring, there is nothing to match on.

To keep the plan safe, they will (should) employ a TPA or similar to review the year-end data and issue corrections in a manner that is considered timely under whichever applicable code.  This process can begin as early as January or as late as the Plan Sponsor pushes it to get us their annual payroll data.  The later they are, the higher the risk of missing timeliness requirements for their corrections and annual filings.\n\n*Source: Am TPA with APA credentials*",

In the end, that account had $12k in it and I lost out a bunch on currency exchange rates, inflation, and market opportunity lost.  My living expenses are very low so I invest most of my salary .  I live in a developing country and it would take me 5 years to spend that here. On top of that, they were charging me the wire fee every month.  They reimbursed me the fees and I was able to wire some of the money back.   I did not bother calculating what I lost out in market gains because I know it will be huge.  They said \"sorry\".",

            "comment": "Not quite the same thing, but I have a similar story about company wide payroll glitch that went unchallenged for years, maybe decades. \n\nI worked for Discover Card from 2004 to 2009. The way they paid full time employees was bi-monthly. On the 15th and last day of the month. Because it wasn't always two weeks they paid people for 86.67 hours twice a month. They explained this as 52 weeks \u00d7 40 hours \u00f7 24 pay periods = 86.67 hours/pay period.  OT and docked time was on a two week lag. \n\nIn 2008 we were working on leap day, Feb 29th. One co-worker mentioned that we should get the day off, because our paychecks weren't going to be any bigger, but this day was one more than the usual year, so we aren't really getting paid for that day. I laughed it off and went back to work. But it nagged at the back of my mind. \n\nBy coincidence in July of 2008 the company switched to bi-weekly paychecks instead of twice a month. This brought the bonus 2/29 day back to forefront. \n\nEventually I sat down with a calendar and counted how many working days there were in that year. 2008 had 262 working days. 5 \u00d7 52 is 260. Based on payroll we were paid for 260 working days a year. At the age of 24 I realized for the first time that a year isn't 52 weeks exactly, it's 52 weeks plus 1 day. By basing our pay on 5 days a week 52 weeks a year, the company was getting one free day whenever that last day was a weekday, and leap years that could be 2 free days, like 2008. \n\nI showed my boss. Because of the payroll change the last 6 months of the year were correct, but that lone 2/29 was sticking out, as a day no one got paid for. He assured us we were wrong, we all got paid for the time we worked. The next day he pulled us into a room, with his own calendar, and we walked through again how we all got shafted out of a day's pay. \n\nHe took it to HR, they looked at it, and sent back a Excel sheet proving payroll was correct and we were wrong. They borked the formulas, and when we sent them the corrected sheet back they said they would kick it up to corporate HQ. \n\nMonths later the entire company gets an email that all full time employees would see one extra days worth of pay on a paycheck in November to account for the payroll system change. \n\nWe went back to HR, and they quietly and unofficially confirmed that we stirred some serious shit in HQ bringing this up, because payroll worked that way for years and years and no one ever accounted for those extra days outside 52 weeks. In early 2009 they gave all full time employees another correction extra day of pay. \n\nIn March of 2009 HR launched an internal audit on our entire team and fired us for \"violating the code of conduct\" for taking 1 hour lunches instead of 30 minute lunches with two 15 minute breaks.

As long as it's not discrimination. \n\nWe worked closely with a team in another department that did similar work. About a month after they fired us, that team was laid off, with 2 months severance plus 2 weeks per year plus they kept the full years PTO. My team was escorted out by security like criminals and the company fought our unemployment (saying we were fired for cause). I was unemployed on 2009 (at the height of the recession), and fighting to get unemployment and applying to 15+ jobs a week. Scary time, 2009 was an absolute shit show for me personally. \n\nThe silver lining is that I got a job the week they filed the unemployment dispute, paying more than I left. So I had no gaps in pay, and found a better job. It was at Wells Fargo and I'm still here, making today 3 times what I made 10 years ago, in a job I really like. So it worked out for me.",

It's sad, but out benefits/HR department are so inept, that they basically tell us to go in and check deductions at the start of each year because they so frequently screw it up and apparently cannot check behind themselves. Im not saying that I shouldn't check, just that it shouldn't be because they are expecting mistakes.",

            "comment": "Great post and good job helping organize people in your company to bring the issue up!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI happen to work of a 401k analytics startup that analyzes these things, and I have to say the fee problem is a HUGE deal that no-one is talking about. **Why?** Because a huge percentage of 401k management fees (things like record keeping, general administrative expense, etc) come directly from the plan balance (your savings!) \u2014\u00a0**AND...** because fees netted from the plan don't appear on your company's financials as an expense, companies often don't pay attention to it. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, fees that are above market by 15-25% are common across the industry and across plan sizes. And the impact of those fees are compounded (like you mentioned) each and every year! **Again, WHY** isn't anyone paying attention? Probably because most people that understand the nature of the problem are somehow compensated by the industry that has grown the problems over time!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, it's super-great you found out about this one \u2014\u00a0it was absolutely glaring! There's probably more issues, especially as you mention Fidelity \u2014\u00a0they're one of the worst in terms of hidden fees. So **PLEASE keep the pressure on**! It's the employees that have to push back on 401k fees as they're the ones being hit come retirement! (See John Bogle's [Frontline piece](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNkcM-nteAm07sUyQzbVu7hi_cM7jcBEL) from a few years back on how fees impact your retirement)",

It had considered I was \"terminated\" and they simply took a significant non-vested amount of money from the 401k without saying a SINGLE WORD TO ME. \n\nI caught it on my financials, reported it to HR, caused an investigation to the investment bank, and then was resolved. They trued me up for all missed allocations, and investments owed. Definitely a good reminder here to CHECK your statement on a regular basis... this saved me almost $20,000. Thanks OP!",

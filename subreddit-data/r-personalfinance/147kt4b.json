    "postText": "I\u2019m a registered nurse.I\u2019m 25.\n\n I make about 58,000 yearly, which is about 4800 monthly. I own a car which is $643 monthly. This is really my only bill other than maybe the gym.\n\nI live with my parents. We get along ok, but I\u2019m dying to have more privacy and would also like to give away my room to my siblings.\n\nI have a boyfriend who also works, but we\u2019ve only been together 7 months. He\u2019s supposed to move out soon from his parents to a place his family owns where he will pay cheap rent.\n\nI live in a major city where rent and most things are not cheap, so it\u2019s been hard for me to find a cheaper, but safe and clean place to rent. I\u2019m thinking about renting an 1/1 apartment if I did move out. Rent where I am is mostly 1900 and up. Mostly in the 2000 range for something safe and clean. \n\nCan anyone give me advice and how to handle my finances? Is it recommended I move out on this salary?\n\nI also do have plans on going back to graduate school for my nurse practitioner license in the next year or 2 as well.",

You could do it for awhile and maybe find a place you like better and potentially move there.  \n\nIf you absolutely want to move out of your parents, I would recommend paying off your car and any other debt first.  That will give you more options for housing.",

You want to keep rent under about 1500 preferably. That way you're looking at one paycheck a month for car and rent and the other check for all other bills and expenses, entertainment, savings, etc. ( not to mention an extra check twice a year)\n\nIt's not ideal but you can make it work by being a little frugal.",

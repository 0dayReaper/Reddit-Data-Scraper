    "postText": "Hi All!\n\nI've been doing some research on selling my Vested RSUs and not sure if I'm understanding people's advice.\n\n  \nI just had some of RSU vested and was thinking of pulling it out. I was expecting to only pay Long Term Capital Gain Tax since its been a little over a year that I have been working for my company but I noticed the Brokerage account  stated I would have to pay Short Term Capital Gain Tax. I figured that I'd just leave it and wait till next year but I read a PSA on another reddit post that said RSUs would always be considered Short Term Capital Gain Tax. Then I read alot of comments that advised to just take out the money and invest wherever you want.\n\n**\\[TLDR\\]**  \nAm I right to understand that I might as well pull out the vested RSUs since I will have to pay Short Term Capital Gains regardless if I wait a year or more? I might as well sell and invest in whatever ventures I'm looking into such as Index Funds and etc?",

            "comment": "When rsu vest, you have to pay ordinary income tax on the vested amount. Usually, the brokerage company will withhold a portion and sell to cover that. You just need to make sure to correct the basis on your taxes next year such that you are not taxed incorrectly.\n\nIf you then hold the stock for more than a year, you would pay ltcg on the gain between the amount at vest and the amount when you sell.\n\nAs for what you should do - I always go back to \u201cif you had that amount of money in cash, would you buy your company stock?\u201d If the answer is no, then sell the rsu and do whatever.",

I would have to pay my standard tax on that $1000 and long/short term capital gain tax on the $100?\n\nFair enough on if I had that money in cash, then would I tye it up in 1 singular company stock. I probably would diversify my portfolio rather than tying it to my just company stock only",

            "comment": "* It's generally a good idea to immediately sell vested RSUs and diversify your investments; having a large amount of your wealth tied to the same company that cuts your paychecks is a risky move.\n* Tax wise, there is zero difference between a company handing you a check for a gross of $X and you buying stock with that, versus handing you $X worth of stock. Grant date/value is completely irrelevant. When the stock vests it's considered income, just like a paycheck.",

A bad stupid decision of someone in the top management can lead to lost of job AND investment loss at the same time.\n\nIn my current company, there was an incident when the single biggest customer (DOD) cut their contract due to a relatively minor bad news. 2/3 of the employees were layoff the same night, stock plummeted 80% the next day. According to me manage at the time who survived the layoff, many of his colleagues had massive company stocks due to very good ESPP plan, many of them contributed 20% of their salary to ESPP, for years to decades.",

It is as if the company paid you $1000 cash and you bought the shares on vest date. $1000 shows up on W2 and is your cost basis. If you sell 1 year after vest, it is long term gains, short term if before. \n\nHold rsu's only if you would buy yourself, and only if you have an exit strategy (when do you sell?). Company stock is only a small portion of my portfolio. I wouldn't get carried away in company stock.",

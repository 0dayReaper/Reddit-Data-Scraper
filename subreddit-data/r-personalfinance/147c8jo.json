There's something driving this desire to take the cash out, and we have no idea what that something is.\n\n\nBy pulling equity out of the house into cash with no actual need or plan for the cash, all you're doing is giving yourself a large number to look at in an account balance -- at least until it's gone. You already HAVE the money in the form of equity in the house, and the barrier to access is a good thing. If you ever DO have a need for it, you can access it relatively quickly via HELOC or something like that. As it stands now, the house is practically guaranteed shelter for you and your children, and it's costing you next to nothing. As a father, that's just about the most important thing that you can provide for your kids. You would be doing them a major disservice to risk that for no reason. Plus, you're gradually getting that money back out with every month that you don't have to pay rent or mortgage, and you can use that for whatever else you are considering.\n\n\nI know that it must be exciting to suddenly have such a large asset at your disposal at such a young age, and that it might look like a world of opportunity is opening up... but the best course of action here (barring some sort of expensive emergency or something) is the most boring one. Just do nothing. Unless, of course, you plan to sell and move somewhere else. Best of luck.",

Just really depends on what you and your other significant future goals are. as far as capitalizing off of your free and clear house you could use the equity in your home to buy assets aka a \u201cheloc\u201d or to invest in education. but again depends on your goals and risk tolerance. you can downgrade to like a mobile home and have 100-200k in savings after sale proceeds.

    "postText": "My son just got his first job, he\u2019s working part time in retail and they offer a 401k. They match 100% on the first 4% and 100% vested. This is just a summer job as he will be going to college in the fall. While he will try to stay on payroll while away at college, he likely won\u2019t be working much with this employer during that time, maybe picking up a few hours over the holidays. \n\nHe wants to start investing his money but I\u2019m not sure what the best route is. \n\nThe employer retirement account is handled through vanguard, so he can always rollover his savings to his next employer.  I\u2019ve never had to do this so I have no first hand experience but is this relatively easy to do? Being that he will be a working college student he\u2019s going to likely have multiple jobs before he settles into a career. Is it advisable to open up a 401k with every employer that offers it vs. opening up a brokerage account and investing on his own?",

            "comment": "If he puts in 4% and they put in 4%, he is getting a 100% return on his money and it grows tax free.\n\n  \nAvoiding taxes is way better than any stock account, unless you catch lightning in a bottle and get a 400% return on your first investment.\n\nAs others have stated, rolling over a 401k from one company to another company is not complicated, just kind of a pain in the derriere.  Remember, these companies have rolled over millions of 401k in their lifetimes now.  They have it down to a science.\n\nSometimes, companies have a limit on how little you can have in a 401k if you no longer work there.  At these times, the administrators will cash out the accounts and then you have to pay taxes, and maybe a penalty.\n\nif that happens, then you want to create a rollover IRA(401k is pre-tax, so a IRA is pre-tax, no penalties, no taxes owed when you roll it over).\n\nIf your son changes jobs a lot, which will probably happen in his lifetime, my oldest is on his fifth job currently, but it looks like he might stay with this one.  He was cashed out of each of his 401ks but it was not a large amount of money, so we told him to just take the cash and pay the taxes.\n\nYour son might want to create a rollover IRA and each 401k he gets at a job, when he leaves, he just rolls it over to his IRA.  \n\nVanguard is one of the good guys in the 401k, IRA, rollovers spheres.  Fidelity is a good company.  Other biggies like T Rowe Price, Janus, and Schwab would be good also.",

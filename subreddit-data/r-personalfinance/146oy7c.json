What about learning skills, to be a freelancer? All these thoughts just overpower me. What about investing money, how will I do that?\n\nCan anyone tell me, how a teenager can start early to secure a succesfull future where they can live comfortably?",

            "comment": "I think you need to take a step back. It\u2019s good to be thinking about your financial future, but you\u2019re way too young for it to be causing considerable stress. I obviously don\u2019t know the specifics of your situation, but if you have a stable home life currently and don\u2019t have to support yourself, you can afford to calm down a little. If your parents can afford it, you\u2019d be better off getting mental health advice rather than financial advice. May I ask where these anxieties are stemming from?\n\nThat being said, assuming you\u2019re in middle / high school, one of the most important things you can do is take your studies seriously. There are ways you can have financial success without school, but doing well in school will keep your options much more open. \n\nThe second thing you should do is practice being responsible with money now. If you save X% each month, stick to a budget, etc. this will build up valuable skills. \n\nYou can educate yourself by reading the wiki (there should be part for your age group). \n\nOne of the most important things you can do now is set yourself up for a career path that will generate decent income. Some people on Reddit really recommend the trades. The \u201cgo to a good CS school, then get a high paying software engineering job\u201c is pretty tried and true, at least up until recently. You could also grind econ, go to a target school, work yourself to death in IB for a few years, and be financially set. However, if you\u2019re just trying to be financially stable, you don\u2019t need to optimize for the highest paying careers possible \u2014 you can just make enough to support yourself, and live within your means.  \n\nWith  regard to studying medicine, I personally think if you\u2019re just in it for the money (which is fine), there are much easier career paths. You will be making almost nothing for many years, and be under immense amounts of stress. If the only thing that\u2019s motivating you is a paycheck, I\u2019m not sure that\u2019ll be enough to sustain you through med school.\n\nSimilarly, freelancing comes with its own trade offs, and is often (generalizing) something people do after they\u2019ve already been successful in a traditional career.\n\nWhich career you should chose to maximize earnings is a long discussion, though. The important thing is to remember is it will also be a significant portion of your life, so potentially also consider what your WLB will be, how much you enjoy the work, etc. There are many, many types of very high income jobs, and even more jobs that will provide enough to make a living with. \n\nAlso, with regard to buying fancy things for your wife, I would say this is not a thing real adults care about. Yes, there are TikToks about 50/50 men, dating high earners, etc., and yes these people are vocal, but in real life, they are a very small fraction. And also \u2014 you don\u2019t have to marry them. You are free to marry someone who doesn\u2019t care what kind of car the neighbors drive, or how big your house is. I know there\u2019s a lot of toxic rhetoric online about a man\u2019s value being connected to his wealth, but it\u2019s important not to let this get to you or you will turn bitter.",

Take time and enjoy these years.\n\nThat said, if you don't want to live paycheck to paycheck, here's the most important advice:  *Don't stupidly borrow money.*  Way, WAY too many Americans - especially in their 20s - take out huge student loans; buy a car they can't afford by financing it; stupidly open credit cards for dumb reasons (\"I like the signup bonuses!\") then run them up, etc.\n\nIf you look around, no one on reddit, no matter who they are or what their karma is, ever have an answer for the foregoing.   Their only \"answer\" is \"go get a credit card with a lower interest rate!\" (which is not an answer at all).  In other words, their \"answer\" is more borrowing.\n\nStatistically, you don't need to earn  a fortune to be a millionaire - you just need to control your spending.  Don't borrow unless you have to; and don't over-borrow.  That's my advice.",

As long as OP is a decent student, and gets into a decent school or ends up in a job or profession that pays decent, **controlling spending as well as borrowing tends to be the bigger issue**. \n\nSee this AITA from a day ago:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145pozb/aita_for_pushing_my_husband_to_sell_the_dream_car/\n\nAlso picking a career based solely on money ignores the real issues of, say, burnout, medical problems ie mental health related or ulcers. Making 6 figures at a job you 100% despise and seem like a complete skills mismatch for is not a recipe for long term success or satisfaction.\n\nFor med school as an example, you have to have a strong science background, have excellent grades, and spend years being overworked and underpaid as a resident. The resulting stress has ended many relationships and the length of time means high student loans. Not to mention the competition just to get picked for med school and selected for residency placement.",

Google lifetime earnings of people with a college degree vs those without.  Also, going through life with a good education is awesome. It empowers you with knowledge and critical thinking abilities that help in all aspects of life, creating an overall high quality of life.  Also regardless of income, learn to live frugally, spend less than you earn and invest the difference each month. Put an emphasis on learning, building strong relationships and developing a few interesting hobbies such as playing music or drawing. Be a kind, educated, curious and responsible person and things will fall into place for you.",

            "comment": "If you are motivated there are two very secure ways to land a job with good income.\n\n1. Get a degree in a specialized occupation that pays well. Some of these can be very competitive with a crap ton of schooling (doctors, lawyer, etc) but there are other jobs in other areas that is a lot easier to obtain. Tech is very common, things with computers, robotics, etc. if you start now and look up things you can do for better success later in that field you\u2019ll be golden. \n\n2. Sales. People good in sales make a lot of money because they directly bring in the most money. Many sales positions that can bring in over 100k don\u2019t even need anything beyond a highschool education. To be good at sales you just have to be willing to deal with the public and have people get angry at you for pushing from time to time. I hated it but if you can get past the part you can make a lot of money. Best way to get good at sales is to take a job, well, selling. And not retail or fast food, see if you can get a job selling phones at T-Mobile, or selling Comcast over the phone, or doing door to door sales. These entry level jobs are far from glamorous, but it gives you the reps to figure out how to do it. Plus your bosses will be motivated to have you sell well, so they will put in as much time as you need to help you. Once you get good at selling look for better sales jobs. Selling cars is a popular destination, but there are a ton of options out there. The nice thing about sales is if you truly are motivated you can generally always move product. When I worked at Comcast there was no cap on commission, and they always offered OT. So if you wanted to you could be smashing your monthly goals AND get paid OT hours to do so. If you work at a used car lot your boss will let you move as many units as you can handle. Basically in sales as long as your willing to put in the time there will always be more money to be made.",

Keep your expenses low enough where you can actually have savings, and guard those savings jealously. 60% of United States adults, including more than four in 10 high-income consumers, live paycheck to paycheck. It's a sucky way to live.\n\nPick a career path that you'll think you'll enjoy and that has upward mobility. If you're passionate about art or social work, consider that artists and social workers make very little money. \n\nIf that good job involves going to college, do it for as little money as possible. About 25% of the posts I see on here are people drowning in student debt. Consider starting in community college, which is free or very cheap in many US states. Other ways to go to school cheap or free: scholarships, employer tuition reimbursement, and military, if you're up for that. \n\nBe careful about credit cards. Another 25% of the posts I see on here are people drowning in credit card debt.\n\nGenerally speaking, don't be afraid to make good choices for yourself that might go against the conventional wisdom. Example: The four year \"college experience\" is greatly overrated, and not worth being saddled with six-figure debt, whatever your family or friends might think. Also, college isn't essential. People who enter skilled trades can make excellent money and have great careers. Military service has allowed many people to break a cycle of generational poverty.",

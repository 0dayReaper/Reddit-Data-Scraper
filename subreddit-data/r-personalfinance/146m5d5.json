            "comment": "Why are you against PMI?\n\nIt's the thing that allows mortgages with less than 20% down. It acts as a second mortgage, or insurance, against the risk when you have put little money down.\n\nAs to why anyone can't easily save 20% down, I'd encourage you to look at history. You mention 'average home selling price', but I strongly suspect you are trying to buy in an above average market, and comparing home prices with a skewed perspective.\n\nYou can absolutely buy a nice home in the Midwest for $130k. You personally may not want to live there.",

There\u2019s only one program that permits any fees to be financed into the loan balance, which has a maximum LTV of 101.75%. There are several low or zero down payment mortgage programs for non VA borrowers. AFAIK, it\u2019s just shifting money around. It\u2019s a higher interest rate, more closing costs or additional due at closing instead of a down payment. The borrowers utilizing the zero down mortgages ultimately pay more in interest than if a down payment and more points were used initially. \n\nI\u2019m also not a huge fan of paying points unless you can receive a substantially cheaper rate and you anticipate owning the home long enough to recoup the money spent. All of NFCU\u2019s conventional low/no money down loans require a minimum of 0.250 points, which are due at closing and can\u2019t be rolled into these loan balances. \n\nI\u2019d also be leery of the ability to refinance these loans. Just my two cents though",

    "postText": "So I am moving to Austin and I have to buy a vehicle to get to work. My plan has changed incredibly over the past few weeks.\n\nI went from deciding to walk to office to buying a electric bike to buying a cheap used car to buying a cheap car to outright taking a 30K loan to buy Nissan Z or Toyota Supra lol.\n\nSafe to say that I am being very indecisive.\n\nMy basic requirements are this:\n\n1. It has to be reliable.\n2. I will be disposing off this vehicle in 2 to 3 years time and I want to be able to recover as much of my investment as possible. Previously I had a 2017 Honda civic and I managed to recover all but 4,000 dollars on my investment. I had 1 accident on it. I ran it into a snow pile. I scratched it against a stone bridge. And I still managed to recover like 83.33% of my investment on that car.\n\nRight now these are the options I am thinking of:\n\n1. Buying a new Toyota Corolla base model. Might work out to around 24K? If I take good care of it unlike my previous car, I think I can recover 21K to 22K back?\n2. Buying a 2013 Toyota Corolla with 25K miles on it from Carmax for 19,000$? Can I sell it back for 16K? 17K if I drive it for another 25K miles in 3 years time?\n3. Leasing it? I don't know how this works. But for 3 years I would end up paying 10K to 12K for the lease and I would have miles limit on it. Sounds like the most horrible option of the three?\n\nIs buying a used car from Carmax a good option? Would I be able to sell it back for good value if I take good care of it?",

            "comment": "1: Stop calling a vehicle purchase an investment. You buy a vehicle to get around, not make money. In 99% of situations, vehicles are depreciating assets, not investments. \n\n2: You're not going to get 90% of the purchase value of a vehicle back after using it for 2-3 years. You got super lucky with your previous vehicle due to extremely unusual market conditions. That will very likely NOT happen again. \n\n3: If you're trying to save money and were originally considering walking/biking to work, why are you now looking at buying a vehicle? Keep in mind that even if you sold the vehicle for exactly what you paid for it, you'll still be paying out thousands of dollars over 2-3 years in license/registration fees, insurance, maintenance, fuel, etc. Even with no payment, a vehicle costs $100/mo just sitting around. \n\n4: Finally, the math on which is better is very easy, but you need numbers. Get a lease quoted, and see how much it'll cost you over the time period. Then, look at purchasing the same vehicle used/new, take into account historical averages for depreciation and see how much you're expected to lose. I would hazard a guess that they most cost-effective option will be buying a 2-3 year old vehicle. But, used vehicle prices are still a bit high, and financing costs are higher on used so the new vs. lightly used math might be pretty close. The advantage of leasing is that you know exactly what the deal is and you don't have to worry about selling a vehicle at the end of the term. Just turn it in and walk away.",

Under normal conditions a new vehicle depreciates 10% pretty much by the time you get home from the dealership lol.\n\nJust get your numbers and do the math. Comparing buying new, used, leasing and see what it'll cost you. Then you'll have your financial answer and it can inform your final decision.",

The no-negotiation is not a good thing when their prices are above average. \n\nExpand your search into smaller dealerships and even Facebook marketplace. The way to buy from an individual is by having a mechanic do a pre purchase inspection to make sure you are not missing anything.",

It just doesn\u2019t make financial sense and they make way too much money off you.\n\nRule number 2: Dont ever buy a brand new car unless you have tons of money and can buy cash. New cars depreciate so fast it\u2019s ridiculous. In 3 years you would be lucky to get 18k back on that Corolla.\n\nThe 2013 Corolla sounds like your best bet but not for 19k. I think for a 2013 there are cheaper cars that are still very reliable, do some more research. \n\nHonestly, if walking is an option I would just opt in to public transportation for a few years which would allow you to really stack up some cash for investments or a future car purchase while at the same time letting you get to know the city better.",

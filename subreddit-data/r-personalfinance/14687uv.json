    "postText": "Gross annual salary: $123,600. Probably will have another 3% bump at the end of the year.\n\nMonthly take-home pay after taxes, insurance and 12% into Roth 401K: \\~$6100. \\~$7300 without 401K.\n\nNo debt, good credit \\~780.\n\nLooking at a house that is about $356K. I have $70K for a down payment, and about 90K in total liquid cash. Total PITI on a 30 year fixed mortgage at 7.1% interest (ouch) would bring the payment to about 2400/mo with that down payment.\n\nI am on the fence. Currently I am paying $1400 in rent so jumping up an extra $1000 makes me nervous. After the total mortgage payment that leaves me with about $3500/mo, and I'm estimating about $1000/mo for utilities, food and other essentials. So realistically I would have between $2000-$2500/mo to spend or save extra. Is this doable? My gut is not really comfortable with this after being able to save \\~60% of my take-home pay from renting so long but I would like to move on to a house, maybe this is one isn't it though.\n\nThanks in advance.",

            "comment": "To put things in perspective for you, I make slightly less on average than you do (6.9k take home) my mortgage payment is $2500. My car payment is 665. I spend another 1500 for everything else. Gas, utilities, insurances, and whatever. I usually save 2-2.5k per month. It feels a little tight. It isn\u2019t really, but it definitely sucks seeing about 5k per month vanish from my bank. Ultimately my family and I are comfortable and have a nice life. I could save more by being homeless and not eating but then why even have money? It\u2019s only useful when you use it.",

In the same time you will have paid off just 40k in principal in the same 10 years. Unless the house is worth 500-550k in 10 years from now the math favors renting and investing.  Now, if your rent starts creeping up quick that changes the equation",

    "postText": "I just graduated from college last month with 60k in student loan debt. About 40k are private loans with 20k being intrest free federal loans. I got a job  with an 85k salary that I'll start in August, so figuring how to pay off the loan isn't that big of an issue. My concern is how I should pay it off i.e. should I aggressively pay it off after each paycheck or set a certain amount say 2k each month. Obviously I should pay off the private loan first. I estimate that my salary after taxes is about 64k. Following the 30% rule on rent, this gives me a budget of $1600/month, unfortunately the rent is pretty high where I will be working with nicer apartments being in the $1800+ range for a single person (I tried looking for a roommate but no luck). There are more affordable apartments in the $1000-1400 range however it's more of a gamble dealing with bad management and poor maintenance. I also currently live 1.5-2hrs from the work site with my parents, so I have thought about commuting as an option as I will be working hybrid with me only coming in two days a week. With that said here are the options I'm considering.\n\n1. Bite down and gamble with cheaper housing 1k-1.4k/month, 2k+ monthy student loan payments, pay off private loans in about 2 years.\n\n2. Stretch budget and choose nicer housing 1.5k-1.9/month, 1k-1.5k monthly student loan payments, pay off private loans in about 3 years.\n\n3. Stay home with parents for one year and commute. 4 hour one way commute 2 days a week. 13k-20k estimated savings from not renting. Pay off all private loans within a year.\n\nAny thoughts or insight on this? What would you do?",

            "comment": "Just to clarify, you say it's a 2 hour commute and a 4 hour one way commute. I'm going to assume you meant 4 hour round trip in option 3. \n\nThat being said, I'd personally live at home, and work 2 consecutive days at the office. Basically, drive to the office on Tuesday morning (2hrs) and overnight at a cheap hotel. Work Wednesday and commute home (2 hrs).  I've done this for a remote client. Found a decent hotel that cut me a deal for frequent stays. Managed to get the hotel, tax, and dinner for around $100.  See what you can find!",

They might even let you keep some stuff there so you don't have to fully pack every time.    \nI don't think I'd do that for a super long time, but doing it for 6 months is really reasonable IF the office is mostly a hybrid office like that.  After six months, hopefully, you've paid of $18k in loans, making a huge early chunk in the private loans.  Also, you may have met people at work or in the town that might allow you to find a roommate.  You might find you are more comfortable with the cheaper housing.  Also, you'll be more secure in what the job feels like.  It sucks to start a job, sign a lease, and realize after 2 months you hate this job, but cannot leave because of your lease.   \n\n\nThe dream would be to then move into housing for $900/mo that is nice with a roommate and be able to pay $2000/mo.  Now you can pay off the private loans in another year or 14 months.  At that point, you can decide if you want to keep living so cheaply and pay off the federal loans in another 10 months, or relax a little, move into the nicer housing, and pay off those loans on a 2-3 more years timeline.",

If the rate on the loans is above 6% I'd pay the loans off rather than investing over the 401k match.  If the loans are less I'd prefer to invest.  I agree on avoiding lifestyle inflation.  Once OP's income can afford a home it makes sense to pay the loans off completely.  With more cash flow it will be easier to make your mortgage payment.",

Spending 4 hours on the road on top of 12 hours in the office was not sustainable. \n\nIf OP could cut the commute and save their mental health, it would be worth the loss in savings until the loans with interest are paid off. However, they can \"suck it up\" and find a less expensive apartment for that time period. They don't have to live in luxury right out of school.",

You'll feel better having paid your dues and early at that. Living like I didn't get raises for 5-6 years allowed me to pay my student debt 17 years early and now debt free.

I view them as financial leverage instead of a burden to get quality of life that we can not access otherwise. (Not recommending to live beyond your means and for the record, credit card debt is almost always a terrible idea).\n\nDecision to pay off the loans quickly and putting rest of your lives on hold should be driven by the interest rate. If your interest rate is 3%, there is no reason to make yourself miserable for it. Pay down the debt, but live your life normally, too.\n\nI graduated with 70k in student loan as well, similar to OP.  Paid it off in just under 4 years- i made extra payments every month. Used parts of any bonus j got as well. But continuously upgraded my life at the same time. Bought 2 cars for us. Saved for downpayment. Just before paying the loan off, also got a house with the help of a mortgage. \n\nOP - prioritize your loan by interest rate. Look at how much extra you can pay easily. Live comfortably, but responsibly. don't splurge mindlessly on the new gadgets or fancy cars until you have paid off your loans and have savings. Throw every extra cent at your loan to pay it off early. \n\nBasically, prioritize paying off your loan, but don't live just to pay off your loans.",

If you are making money, your loan providers will find it. \n\nWhat you should do is follow the prime directive in the wiki. How much you allocate to paying off your loans will depend on the interest rate and your other financial goals. If your interest rate is low, it might make sense to pay the minimum and invest the rest. Also, personally, a 4 hour one way commute sounds like a nightmare. \n\nGood luck, sounds like you have the opportunity to have a nice life if you play your cards right.",

Yes, you would gain from having that long commute and listing to the podcasts listed below, but that 16 hrs/week driving is fuel/maint/wear/tear on your vehicle unless you are on a bus/plane/train.\n\nWhat would I do: depends on how well I got on with my parents, but I'd probably find a room in a house or apt to rent near work where I split cost with other people, living like I did in school.   I'd sure try to keep the rent as low as possible, commute as short as possible, COL as low as I could.  Plow money into retirement investments and shed expensive debt slavery.",

Having your own place and putting down roots is important - you studied and worked to be an adult - reap some benefits. A month or two to determine if the upgraded housing is \"worth it\" is fine though.\n\nYou are working hybrid - so a good apartment can make a pretty big difference. Something with amenities you will use (e.g. gym, maybe pool) can have a significant impact on QOL. If the other ones are just more dated that is fine, maybe worth saving the money. Are you single? Are you the type who may want to have people/dates over? How much does your environment affect your mental state?\n\n\nIf you can find out the \"culture\" at the apartment complex - choose the one with people you might become friends with. If you can put down a solid friend group it will be worth dramatically more than any savings. This is also why you cant live far away (unless the job is in a bum town, but it sounds like its somewhere cool). \n\n\nReally we need to know more about you interest rates and you personally to make a good assessment.",

When you're an independent adult living on your own, there are always unexpected costs coming up and you have to be prepared for those.\n\n\\- Understand what your loan interest rates  and your payment plans are. I failed on this one for several years after graduating and ended up paying way more than I needed to. In one case, I was on a payment plan that was such a minimal amount that the interest really racked up. In another case, I had consolidated loans into a private loan during school (mistake #1), and then I didn't understand that the interest rate was very high for the current environment (mistake #2). I ended up refinancing that private loan when interest rates were low, but I do cringe thinking about all the extra money I paid because I didn't realize that earlier. I know interest rates are high right now, but definitely keep an eye on them as you're paying off the loan.\n\n\\- From your options, I would probably choose #1. You want to enjoy your time as a young adult while you can! But you also don't need to drastically upgrade your lifestyle right away. Live frugally, but not so frugally that you aren't really living.",

I think the real question is can you actually see yourself living like that?\n\nI lived with roomates for the first 2.5 years after graduating until I just couldn't go on with it more. Then I lived with my parents for two months after switching jobs, and it felt like forever. There's no question student loans are incredibly stressful and can feel like a burden when we want to start our lives ASAP, but we also can't let them define who we are and the lifestyles we want to live.\n\nIf you chose to live alone, I think you're approaching the housing equation backward. I never understand why people are willing to stretch their budget in order to rent a \"luxury\" apartment. It's a bit of a different story if you're stretching your budget for a place you can own. That's not a knock on your post, rather, the definitions our generation places on what we ought to spend our money on. Nice cars, nice clothes, nice apartment, etc.\n\nInstead of \"How much can I spend on an apartment,\" Ask yourself \"What do I need in an  apartment?\" You can usually save tons of money if you find a place that has all the typical old-school housing traits like window A/C, baseboard heat, shared laundry, street parking, and old appliances. If you're OK with commuting 2 hours by living with your parents, maybe look for an apartment further away from your office?\n\n*Edited for clarity*",

Even your *least* aggressive proposed plan here--3 years to pay off 40k in loans--is actually still VERY aggressive. Unless the interest on them is insanely high, it won't make that much of a difference long-term. Bumping down my own student loan plan from a \"pay it all off in 5 years\" plan to a \"pay it all off in 7 years\" plan was hands-down one of the best financial decisions I have ever made. Don't starve yourself to avoid doing the same.\n\nAt this stage in life (exiting college, starting new adulthood), having a social life and building an emergency fund are significantly more important than paying off your loans in 5 years instead of 6. The emergency fund of course being the important part (see: the Prime Directive on the subreddit sidebar, though I disagree with it putting retirement before HSA; HSA should be a much higher priority). Aim to have 2-3 months of expenses in accessible liquid cash before worrying much about paying down long-term expenses like student loans.\n\nImportant clarification: \"having a social life\" does not necessarily mean lifestyle inflation. You do still want to keep that to a minimum if possible.  What you want to prioritize is your *time*. Minimize your commute times as much as possible. Live near the things you want to spend your time doing. Don't spend too much money on material luxury, but do spend money on *reliability*. Don't get the apartment with the fanciest-looking lobby, but do invest in living in a neighborhood where you're going to actually enjoy living. Don't get a fancy sports car, but make sure you drive something that isn't going to break down. Don't go get front row seats at every concert and sporting event, but do take every single chance you get food or drinks out with friends.\n\nYou're making, I estimate, around 80k before taxes as a 22/23-year old. That's probably in the top 5% or so of people your age, and pretty much everyone higher than that will be in NYC or The Bay where rent is twice what you describe. You are doing *really*, really well financially. Don't deprive yourself of live just to make the numbers on the computer screen go lower slightly faster. No one has ever said \"wow, sacrificing my early twenties to be debt free at 26 instead of at 28 really changed my life!\" You can always get more money; you can't get back more time.\n\nMost typical answers on this sub are going to be geared towards someone that has insane out-of-control debt that needs to be paid down ASAP. That doesn't sound like you. You're in an extremely healthy spot already; don't hurt yourself trying to hyperoptimize it further. Any decision you make, ask yourself: what does this actually gain me in concrete terms?",

If you are not paying them rent offer them some rent maybe $500-700 a month it will help you argue you are a responsible adult if they get into patterns of treating you like a child.  Pay the minimum required on the student loans for the first few months so you can build a small emergency fund for yourself (or the first, last and deposit for when you are ready). Then just pay off as much of that private loan as you can in the shortest amount of time. Make sure your loan is set so any additional payments to paying down the principal. You might have to make the principal payments separately. Many loans default extra payments as future payments so it just puts your payment due date further out.",

I'd recommend option 3 if the commute was not 4 hours 1 way. That commute is terrible. After I graduated from college I stayed in a $600 per month apartment in a sketchy neighborhood and commuted an hour each way to my first professional job to save money to pay off my student loans. I was living with my gf at the time and we split the bills so that saved me more money to put toward the debt. We had to get gas for the car about 2 times a week so I'd imagine that a 4 hour commute would mean you'd be using a lot of gas on your commuting days which is another big factor to take into consideration. I paid off my loans in about 1 year and then moved close to where I was working because I valued my time even though the cost of living significantly increased.\n\nTLDR: Find a cheap apartment within an hour of your job and pay off loans aggressively.",

            "comment": "I was and still am in a nearly identical situation to you, here are my tips.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\- Even only twice a week, that commute will be horrible. Housing is worth the cost, just focus on keeping it at or near that 30% mark. It's understandable that it isn't always achievable, but it's good to strive towards. There is a line to walk between financially conscious and living life, but that's up to you to define.\n\n\\- Realistically the private loans are the real killer. The federal loans likely have a lower interest rate and more protections for you. I also pay \\~2k a month extra on my private student loans, which are nearly identical to yours, and personally have found that my investments outperform the interest of my federal loans. This of course is a little bit of a risk (paying the federal loan is a definite ROI of the interest percent).\n\n\\- Your first goal isn't to pay your loans off as fast as possible. Pay the minimum automatic payment, or a little over it, until you have an emergency fund. Personally I saved for a year before really tackling my student loans, which allowed me to reinforce my retirement as early as possible and make sure that I am ready for any unknowns (lay off, health bills, etc). A year may be overkill, but I wanted to ensure my safety if I decide to not grow the savings during repayment of my loans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLastly, make sure you make a budget and follow the prime directive in the wiki. This is the best advice anyone can give.",

Like other have said, now is the time to be aggressive as possible.\n3. Consider using the debt snowball method. I had 80k in loans and this helped me see progress. Instead of going after highest interest, pay off the smallest loan first - this gives you confidence it can be done. ( you can adjust to going after high interest as needed)\n4. Be persistent. Every paycheck, first thing you do is send payment to those loans until their gone.\n\nA couple side notes, you can also set aside a month or 2 worth of expenses in savings as a starter emergency fund.\n\nBut overall you can do it - it takes time and determination but you will be so much better off later in life being debt free!

I knew that because I only would earn that 55k salary for 7 months, my tax liability wouldn't be that high, so I claimed exempt on my W-4 and banked the extra $200/week from the lack of tax withholdings. I did this for approximately 9 months and quickly banked up 14k. in 2014, I changed my withholdings back to 1, filed my taxes and just like I thought, I owed the feds like 2k and the state 1k. I paid that off from the 14k and threw like 8 or 9k at the highest interest loans. For the next 2 years I just made double payments and chunked something like 10k to pay them off just shy of 3 years after graduation.\n\nIf you can claim exempt for maybe one tax year and make sure you have enough money to pay your taxes, you can chunk a huge amount at the beginning of the next tax year. This becomes a little sketchier as your income goes up because if you don't pay your taxes on time, the IRS will forbid your employer from allowing you to claim exempt.",

It's also harder to go back once you have a taste of that lifestyle, so delay the lifestyle creep.  \n\n\n4 hours of commuting is soul-sucking.  You have more valuable things to do with your time, unless you're taking a train and can do something productive while you're commuting.  Take the cheaper housing and don't stretch your budget.    \n\n\nInvest your savings.  The more you save &amp; invest early, the easier you'll have it later on.",

This will mean that for your 20k government loans you can pay this $200 payment for 100 months until it is paid off and as long as you pay that amount the loan will not accrue interest. In other words, don't rush to pay of the 20k loan since it's basically a 0% interest loan under the new IBR plan.",

I would suggest make a budget of your essential bills, then set aside some money for pleasure, and then put all your spare money towards paying off the loans without compromise (maybe get a little nest egg first to cover any unexpected costs). The time will go by quick and the more you watch those numbers drop the more motivated you\u2019ll be to keep going. Whenever I got a raise I would put the extra money towards the loans too because I was already used to living on a certain amount. I believe it took me just over a couple years to pay mine off if I remember right. Also to me the commute for the third option sounds like a nightmare lol.",

Don\u2019t buy a new TV or laptop or car or start dressing like you have a bunch of money. Take cheap vacations like camping. Don\u2019t pick up bad habits like smoking or drinking. Live frugal like a monk for a couple of years, make it a lifestyle habit, get a room mate who is an adult but also lives like a broke college student (preferably isn\u2019t in college like you!) and you will be done paying it off in a couple of years. If your first job out of college isn\u2019t paying enough then save up pot of money and in a year or two start job hunting for a second job. Your first job may not respect you enough to give you a raise or maybe it isn\u2019t a good fit. People these days usually make more money by job hunting.\n\nGood luck.",

That's literally like driving to another state for work. \n\nThe best thing you can do is rent an apartment closer to work. I know you said you tried looking for a roommate without any luck, but that's only because you probably didn't look online. There are tons of ads of people looking for roommates. You can create your own ad too. Go for the nicer place and share. Quality of life will be a lot better.",

If this were my problem, I'd call the insurance company and explain to the rep what's going on and find out what codes they are expecting to see. Then I would call the doctor and see if those new codes are acceptable to attempt to submit a new bill.",

The first code is a diagnostic code. The diagnostic codes are extremely complex and depending on the medical records system is actually very easy to make minor or sometimes even bigger mistakes. Each code has what are called specifiers that help explain the difference between like a rash that is all over the body versus one that is on a specific part of the body (this is just a small example by the way, there are literally thousands of codes, for those interested look up something called ICD codes). The second code used is a procedural code or CPT code for short. Again there are multiple codes and specifiers and again very possible for a busy doctor to enter in error or incorrectly. Large hospitals have groups of professionals whose jobs are to be experts on these codes and to review documentation. So you need to ask the insurance company what is wrong with the codes and why it was not covered. I am assuming you are in the US and if the insurance is giving you the run a round you can contact the state insurance board to file a complaint and ask for help with the dispute.",

Doctors are usually going to be clueless when it comes to coding. Most systems will automate this process for them, and if they can't find the right template, they won't look very long and use whatever is convenient.\n\n3. Your billers are not clinical and are clueless about your condition and the treatment actually given. They see the code and assume that's what happened.\n\nFor both your examples, I honestly feel like it's a shitty system taking advantage of you.  \n\nFor first issue:  In the future be sure to schedule preventative visits specifically as a preventative visit.  If this did count as your yearly checkup, you might have luck with explaining this to the billers - just say it was scheduled incorrectly and you only had your yearly preventative visit.  Good luck on this one.\n\nFor the second:  I were you, I would ask your insurance company for the coding they would expect this to be and explain the differences to you between the uncovered code and the covered code.  This sounds like it would fall under a \"specialist visit\" that usually just carries a higher copay.. but I don't know your specific plan.  Once you have a good understanding, you can tell the billers it doesn't look like it was run correctly, if they refuse, there's usually a way to go about disputing it.\n\nIn either event, the billers sound like assholes, and I would tell your physician you are looking to go see someone else because they keep billing you incorrectly. They might be able to light a fire under the ones that aren't helping you and others. They'll lose patients if they don't fix it.",

Sometimes patients mention another problem, let\u2019s say \u201cY\u201d. Sometimes \u201cY\u201d requires a new medicine and in order to prescribe that new med, I have to add a diagnosis code which can result in increase in billing codes and amount billed. Sometimes \u201cY\u201d does not need a medicine but just medical counseling. Sometimes I will document about \u201cY\u201d in my note but not submit a new diagnosis for it (reasons vary but it could be as minor as I forgot) and sometimes I will. This addition or lack of additional diagnosis code will change final billing. So sometimes you go in for a check up and you talk about a few things and still no charge because annual check ups are usually covered and other times there will be additional charge. Once again, it\u2019s not a perfect system and I/most physician do their best to be consistent. At a minimum, I May forgot to upcode but I will never falsely upcode to increase billing and charges.",

I told him that 'its been fine, completely under control'. No more than 15 words between the two of us on the subject. The office considered that \"discussion\" beyond the scope of an annual physical, even though *he* asked *me* about it. I wouldn't have brought it up myself, since it was a non-issue. The doctor's office refused to accept how fully unreasonable that was, and I had to resolve the issue with my insurance company, who agreed that the minimal extent of the conversation should be considered part of the annual physical, and they then they resolved the issue with the office on my behalf.\n\nOn a previous, separate incident, I needed a covid test. My doctors office had been sending spam emails about availability for \"free\" walk-up testing at the point during the pandemic when most test sites were only scheduling 3-days out, and which would be booked within 5 or so minutes after midnight. So I called my Drs office, they confirmed I could get a free test, I went, they tested me, and I left. A month or so later, I got a bill where I had a patient responsibility to pay for an office visit. When I called, their explanation was that because the \"free\" test was administered in the office, then the test constituted an office visit. My insurance company agreed with that explanation and refused to pay. The service my primary care office provided was virtually identical to what CVS minute clinic was doing at the time, yet minute clinic wasn't billing for any sort of 'office visit'.\n\nFuck that practice, and fuck the US \"healthcare\" system.",

Other things like your routine mammogram, pelvic exam, colonoscopy, etc are also covered if indicated.\n\n\nHowever, if you\u2019re bringing up new complaints or your hypertension or diabetes is uncontrolled and you need to make adjustments to your medication regimen, then that\u2019s no longer just a \u201cwellness visit\u201d and can be billed for an additional E/M code (evaluation and management).\n\n\nPerhaps your physician was kind and just decided not to bill for these things in the past.  However, as medicine becomes more corporatized and insurance reimbursement falls, the bean counters are definitely pushing us to fully bill for everything we do in a visit.\n\n\nSource: Physician\n\n\nEdit 1: Read further down and saw that OP\u2019s visit in question was a virtual visit.  Most primary care docs I know don\u2019t do routine health maintenance exams virtually, so I suspect this was an E/M visit and OP was hoping to get it billed under their annual.  That\u2019s not how it works.  If you go to the mechanic because you hear something rattling under the hood, then you can\u2019t just ask them to cover it as if you just wanted an oil change.  Evaluating the new problem takes time, it may require addition labs and images that need to be reviewed and we\u2019ll have to try to figure out what\u2019s going on.  Insurance doesn\u2019t pay you for time you take to interpret the results and piece the puzzle together once all the results come in several weeks later.  If it\u2019s going to take a bit of the physician\u2019s brain power to figure out, then they\u2019re going to bill for it.",

Usually annual checkups as is meant by patients is a physical exam (this is what is free under ACA). This shouldn\u2019t really be telehealth because the point is to DO a physical exam + counseling/preventive screening. Now, if I have some in for a physical I will also do their Med review as part of it but won\u2019t include the separate code for that (My system in general doesn\u2019t force us too but I am sure there are places that would double code this).  It\u2019s arguable whether a provider could do so (codes are based on time and/or medical complexity - its an algorithm).\n2. if I had a patient scheduled telehealth for a checkup I would do their Med review and bill accordingly - which is NOT a physical and it\u2019d be fraud if I submitted it that way (there\u2019s no actual physical exam documented). Now, if it said in the booking notes it was for a physical I\u2019d just have them reschedule in person.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nas an aside: it\u2019s actually really hard to do a full physical plus/minus Med review AND adequately evaluate multiple new concerns. I can usually squeeze in one big issue or several minor but they\u2019re rushed and frankly it isn\u2019t really safe. We are booked back to back to back all day and I simply do not have enough t8me go through the whole history/assessment/plant testing) for a lot of new concerns in the 30 minute visit. We hate it too, but rushing and jamming more in is how things are missed/misdiagnosed.",

But that isn't for everyone, and I'm personality surprised that in your case your secondary billing codes aren't also covered by insurance, but then I'm not an insurance expert by any means and may just have good insurance that covers whatever comes up.

OP was not ripped off, their is just some coding insurance issue that is preventing the insurance from paying this (nothing to do with telehealth).

Even I know it\u2019s covered, but what if the doctor decided it\u2019s not? \n\nLet\u2019s say that my throat is itchy. I thought that it\u2019s a cold but the doctor said it can be a symptom of a cancer of some organ. The doctor asked more questions and run all the diagnostic tests on me. Later it turned out to be a cold. Good for me. Not good for my wallet.",

    "postText": "I currently have a roof that is nearing its life and needs to be replaced. We have two leaks that have caused ceiling damage and need to be repaired.\n\nI had two roofing companies come by and give me estimates. I had a third guy come by today and give an estimate but he also noticed that there was wind damage on the shingles and pointed it out to me. He says he works with insurance all the time and says he can help me file a claim so that the insurance will pay for it. \n\nI didn't get any bad vibes from this guy and his company has great ratings from google and yelp. Is there a down side to having insurance pay for the roof? The worst they can say is no right? Im surprised that the other two guys didn't recommend insurance pay for it. Anyways, it would be nice if all I had to do was pay my deductible and get a new roof instead of taking out a personal loan. ",

They can draft up a report that says even though the roof needs to be replaced by wear and tear that the storm damage reduced the life of the roof and insurance needs to pay for it.",

One of the roofers said the same as yours and we were very hesitant but it worked out.  \n\nInsurance went up about 25%. However, we shopped around and switched companies to bring it back down to what it was. \n\nIt went up about 10% this year. \n\nThis could be state dependent. I know some states, FL and CA, can be more difficult when it comes to home insurance.",

The fact you started getting quotes for your end of life roof without any thought of storm damage or filing an insurance claim also speaks volumes. \n\nThere is an entire cottage industry of unscrupulous roofers who work with shady attorneys and public adjusters to push borderline or outright fraudulent roofing claims. And under threat of high cost of litigation, they manage to squeeze money out of the insurance companies. This has absolutely ruined the insurance market in FL.",

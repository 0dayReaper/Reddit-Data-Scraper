It's kind of a waste taking classes that aren't a part of your major's plan, though. (Music 115 with Morton is easy and really fun and meets CSU transfer requirements if you're going that route.) \n\nI guess it also depends on how far along you are with math and what level you tested in to (or transferred into).",

You don't want to take math the same semester as the two accounting classes, each has a lot of homework. \n\nIf you need help with Business Calculus and Stats, see Kim in the tutoring center.  He looks like Santa with a dodgy hip, but he knows his stuff.  There's also a short Middle Eastern gal who is really good too.  She sits near Kim. See Junior for the accounting classes.  Take those back to back with Michael Barendese(something like that).  Also take Kielher for Business Law and Communication.  Michael McHan for Comm Speech.  There are no tests, just speeches.  It sounds scary, but it's really not.  If you have a heavy workload his class doesn't require much.  ",

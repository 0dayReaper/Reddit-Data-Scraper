When I had counseling they said after Math 110 I should take Math 176 (or split it up into 170/175.)\n\nOnce I started mapping out my future classes I noticed Math 176 says:\n\n\"Prerequisite: \u201cC\u201d grade or higher in MATH 110 or equivalent\nand MATH 097 or equivalent.\"\n\nMATH 097 looks to just be a small credit/no credit class.  There's only one section offered this semester so I'd be surprised if it's something that is required before Math 176 but I don't want to assume anything.\n\nSince I'm taking Math 110, do I really need to also take Math 097 before 176, or is it something that could have been cleared when I originally took my math assessment, or based on my old high school record?  How could I find out if I'm cleared for it or need to take it?\n\n(Side note: I already took/passed MATH 103 years ago when I was planning on a non-science major.  I'm now returning to college so I'm taking Math 110.)\n\n",

That being said, it's really hard to meet with a counselor right now, so you may want to talk with one of the Math Dept. chairs -- Susan Working or Shirley Pereira. Otherwise, your assessment is what's considered the \"equivalent\" in the language you provide. Good luck and again, my apologies!",

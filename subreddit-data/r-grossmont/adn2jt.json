I went to UCSD for a few years but had to drop out because of problems at home/family. I'm looking to get an A.S in Mathematics, and am hoping some of the general ed classes I took at UCSD fulfill the requirements at Grossmont. Example classes: PHYS 10, BILD 10, ANTH 21, Math 18(?). I imagine the easiest thing would just head up there and ask but I cannot do so at the moment and am curious if any of you have useful information. Thanks so much",

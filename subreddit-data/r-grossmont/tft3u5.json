    "postText": "Ever wanted to try theater, but felt like it was too intimidating? Come join our production crew and help us create the work behind the drama.\n\nWe are looking for all kinds of supporting crew people especially designers, carpenters, and painters. There are practical reasons why the theater doesn't have these extra hands, but that means there is lots of room for more people to join us.\n\nDm me for more information about the production or the theater in general. Thanks!",

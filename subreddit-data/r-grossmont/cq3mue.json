    "postText": "I'm currently enrolled online at Grand Canyon University to get my Bachelor's in Elementary Education, but my current job would like me to have Child Dev. 131.  I need to get the class syllabus to send to GCU so they can see if they have a comparative class that I can add to my courses, or if I will need to take this class at Grossmont. I've only been able to find a syllabus for this class on some subscription service that wanted to charge me at least $10-20 to access. If anyone can help me, I'd really appreciate it!",

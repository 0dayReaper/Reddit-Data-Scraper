    "postText": "Im 27 years old, never enrolled in college, just enrolled for grossmont last week, did my fsa, fafsa, and got my student ID,  but I need more information, I would really like to be able to sit down with someone and discuss what I need to do, I spoke with someone today about setting up an appointment with a counselor and all they said was its quicker over the phone, so I asked the questions I could remember as I was in the car and not at home, but the info she gave me would only have been helpful had I been through this process before. I am very confused an uneducated as to what I need to do to officially get into school, and have a lot of questions I would like to ask in person, sitting down with someone, not standing in line feeling like Im at the DMV, I understand its a busy place, but there has to be someplace or someone I can speak to one on one in an office type situation. Can you help me?",

She is the absolute best counselor at Grossmont. \n\nIf you're going to be on campus soon I can sit down and meet with you. I have been through the system long enough that I can answer most questions. I know the general ed counseling sheet like the back of my hand, haha. I can help guide you through the campus and pass on some tips/tricks I've learned while there. \n\nI'm on campus Mon-Thursday this summer. Drop me a PM and we can work something out. I love helping people navigate the college!! :)",

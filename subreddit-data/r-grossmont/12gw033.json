    "postText": "This has been on my mind for a while now and I need to find some way to let people know. Essentially, the financial aid department at Grossmont has been screwing me over and I'm curious if anyone else is having these issues.\n\nSome background, I'm currently a straight-A student but this wasn't always the case. When I first graduated high school I took some classes at Grossmont and didn't do so hot, ended up dropping out multiple times. When I came back to school during the pandemic I worked with a counselor to get my financial aid back on track and they were very helpful. They told me I needed to appeal for Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) if I wanted to receive financial aid, basically I needed to give them a good reason why my GPA was terrible at the time. This was in spite of me never receiving financial aid before. I did so and got approved, and was able to start receiving finaid from that first semester. The approval process was over a month long though, which meant I couldn't actually get the aid I needed until way later.\n\nThen things get a little sticky. Every semester after that, I get an email a week before the first day saying I'm disqualified for finaid because of SAP, again, which is never true because my GPA since coming back has been fine.  Every semester after the disqualification, I have to contact the finaid department and let them know their system made an error, and every semester it takes them months to fix the problem. This pushes back my scheduled payments, essentially withholding the funds for much longer than they should be.\n\nMore recently I was able to get an academic renewal which nixed the grades for my initial attempts at Grossmont, raising my GPA higher. In spite of this, I got hit with another disqualification for going over a certain amount of units, caused by the first couple classes I took out of high school. Since I'm on my last semester at Grossmont and already approved for graduation, I was able to appeal this easily since all they wanted to know was how many more units I expected to take before graduating.\n\nBut like, why was this even a problem? I had already applied for graduation by the time I got hit with this. Once again, the appeal process took over a month to get sorted out. The process itself was needlessly complicated with me having to schedule with two different academic counselors to sign off on the appeal because the first one literally ghosted me and stopped replying to my follow-up emails even after he said he'd help me with it.\n\nIn regards to the SAP disqualification still hitting my account for no reason, at the beginning of this Spring semester when it happened again I reached out to my finaid counselor. He told me that the financial aid department has known about this issue FOR YEARS, and they have done nothing to fix it. He said it happens to every student who has ever had to apply for a SAP appeal, and every semester they have to go back and manually approve every student that the system has wrongly disqualified. This adds an incredible amount to their appeal workload, which makes the appeal process take even longer, all because of how the system has been programmed. He told me the head of the department is the only person with the authority to fix it and that they don't know how and are unwilling to learn, which means the system is working essentially how it was programmed to work, as designed.\n\nSeriously!? This sounds like something fishy is going on in the financial aid department! I just had my financial aid payments pushed back A THIRD TIME this semester, which means I'm not getting my first financial aid payment for this semester until MAY. I was able to get in with the ARC and EOPS and even my EOPS grant is expected to come in before that. I've been having these problems in spite of all of my good efforts, in spite of my now stellar GPA, and in spite of my financial need. I was counting on these payments and have already sold off personal belongings to pay for essentials. At this point, what's stopping them from simply not releasing the funds altogether if even their own payout schedule is a joke to them?\n\nThis is Grossmont failing its low-income students at its most explicit, considering this is a systemic issue at this point. The lack of competency in the financial aid department is astounding. I'm very curious if anyone reading this has had this issue with SAP as well, and I'm even more curious if anyone has any ideas on how to move the dial and go about getting this fixed.\n\ntl;dr:\n\n\\- Straight-A student approved to graduate this semester is still getting disqualified for finaid  \n\\- Was told every student who's ever appealed a low GPA will be automatically disqualified every semester  \n\\- Only person who can fix this is too incompetent and doesn't care enough to learn  \n\\- Finaid department pushes back payments as much as they want with no consequences",

            "comment": "Update on this, after showing up in-person to the FA office they told me my payout would revert back to April 13th and it did. They told me students get packaged up together for disbursements and I kept getting moved back with the students I was packaged with, which yet again suggests I'm not the only student being effected by this. Still interested in hearing if anyone else is encountering these issues.",

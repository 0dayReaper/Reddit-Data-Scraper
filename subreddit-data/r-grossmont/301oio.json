    "postText": "I'll be moving to SD from Sacramento this summer as I'll be attending Grossmont College's cardiovascular tech program. I'm looking to live on my own (bad experiences in past with bad housemates), so a 1 bedroom apartment or a studio is preferable. Looking for a place that's not too far from the school, where I can take public transportation instead of driving. Also, a big plus is if there is a skatepark in the area. I've done some searching on craigslist, apartmentsguide, and trulia, but nothing too concrete - just searching around. \n\nCan anyone give any insight? Any help is appreciated!\n",

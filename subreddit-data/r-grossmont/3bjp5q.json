I've got all my forms in and everything.  Just waiting to see if I get approved to see if I've been approved for enough to move from Sacramento to San Diego.  \n\nThanks for any help received.  ",

There was an extra form they requested from me, but they didn't want it over the phone or via email, they wanted it in person.  So I had to wait until May 15th, the orientation for the program I got into, to do it since I live in Sacramento.  \n\nOh well.  I've still got some time.  Hopefully it comes soon....",

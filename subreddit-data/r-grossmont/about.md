Rules:

Reddit rules are enforced: 

Be respectful: Friendly arguments and discussions are okay, fighting and name-calling are not. Beware ad hominem attacks that aim for the user and not the the point they're trying to make. This also means be ready and willing to entertain alternate viewpoints. You may disagree, but we need to treat each other well.

Keep posts on-topic: This reddit is maintained to serve the students, faculty, and community around Grossmont College. Advertisements that are not explicitly relevant to the Grossmont College community are not allowed. Low effort posts will be removed.

Academic dishonesty is not tolerated: Posts seeking to undermine academic integrity will be removed and repeat offenders will be banned. Plagiarism or encouraging members to take academically dishonest actions falls under this.

Avoid posting duplicates of recent topics: If there is still an active discussion about the topic you're about to post, please contribute to that discussion with your thoughts instead.

Avoid derailing, hijacking, or necroing posts: If you have something you'd like to talk about that may be only tangentially related to an existing topic, you are encouraged to make your own post. If a topic is over a year old and hasn't received regular updates, you are encouraged to start a new conversation regarding it.

Titles, posts, and comments in ALL CAPS will be deleted: 

Titles should be descriptive, not clickbait: Posts with titles deemed to be too clickbait-y will be deleted. Keep the titles relevant to the topic and descriptive about the intention of the post.

Rules are enforced at the moderators' discretion: This means the moderators might miss some things, or otherwise allow some posts to exist while others are deleted. Moderators are not perfect people, but are people too.

    "postText": "I am trying with everything I have to be happy for her but I feels impossible. I 25f was told I would have a hard time carrying a baby to term. Not because of my lifestyle or a habit or anything, I was just built like this. My cousin (21f) just gave birth 2 days ago to her first child, also the first kid from my generation. He's healthy and her and her husband are happy but I'm devastated. \n\nShe knows I can't have kids because my dad has a loud mouth and told his family about my condition. When she was pregnant she would go out of her way to rub it in my face that she was a mom and \"that's what a real woman is\". I try to put up a strong face but it crushes me inside. I want to be a mom more than anything. My grandmother is also rubbing it in my face how I'm failing at being a woman since my younger cousin became a mom before me.\n\nI've already gone low contact with her and most of my dads family but my dad came home and was talking about the birth and going on and on and gushing over the new baby. I blew up at him about it but he doesn't really understand why I'm so upset about. I haven't told him or anyone really how awful she's been to me because it won't fix anything. I'm trying to not be petty, I'm trying to not be mean, I'm trying to get the green monster on my shoulder to go away because it won't fix anything and it's only making me mad but it's really hard. \n\nIf you made it this far, thanks for listening",

So, holidays are me, husband, our two daughters and my sister. When step-dad and wife aren\u2019t travelling, they join. \n\nAt first, I was sad at the thought of a small gathering. I had an awful family, just like yours. Oh, holidays and birthdays were big, full of food and people\u2026 but there was always drama\u2026someone having to outshine everyone else or not talking to this person for x reason\u2026 it was exhausting but I put up with it because \u201cit\u2019s the only family I had. People would kill to have this many family member\u2019s at a party!\u201d\n\nCutting all of my family off and surrounding myself with people who add joy to my life was the best thing for my mental health. Also, I started looking forward and enjoying the holidays! \n\nThere isn\u2019t a day that goes by that my partner and I regret our decision. Our family might be small but at least there\u2019s love, genuine laughter and wanting to be amongst each other. Don\u2019t surround yourself with assholes just because they\u2019re \u201cfamily.\u201d I\u2019ve learned that I\u2019d rather be happy and alone then amongst the kind of people that feel better about themselves by tearing down others.\n\nGo make your own family! Trust me when I say, my friends have been more of a support than my blood relatives.\n\nPS: Not to get your hopes up but don\u2019t be so hard on yourself about not being able to have kids. Some times, doctors are wrong. I was told I wouldn\u2019t be able to get pregnant, and if I did, it would be hard to carry a baby to full term (diagnosed with PCOS). While I did suffer four miscarriages, I did have two successful pregnancies! \n\nYou never know what could happen. Live your life! Give it to the universe and, if it happens, never take a day with your children for granted. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t let it define you as a woman. Getting jizzed in and incubating a fetus for 9 months doesn\u2019t make you a domestic goddess. Any woman can lay down and get pregnant, but a *real* woman is one who lifts up other women and takes joy from seeing their dreams accomplished.\n\nMy advice, seek therapy and talk to another woman who have help you find your strength and make it grow.",

Also if u r honest then if anyone tries to force u to see them or push it they will look like the assholes. But also u dont have to do this either, do what is best for u.\n\nAdoption is also an option as well and if not adopting then fostering might be a good idea as well.",

Yes, your cousin is rubbing it in your face per se, but a big pregnant belly is a pretty big billboard. You'd be jealous even if she was gracious and kind to you because she has something you can't have. Millions of women get pregnant every year; they're literally everywhere. In order to function properly and healthily you must make peace with your body's inability. We all have limitations. Just like there are millions of women having babies there are also millions of women who cannot, you are not alone. There's more than one way to make a family, so giving birth isn't your only option for motherhood. You might say that it's not fair, or it's not the same but life isn't fair; we have to play the hand we're dealt. How we play that hand is how our life is measured. Jealousy is an awful, evil emotion that nothing good comes from; please don't let it destroy you. Jealousy causes you to mistreat people because they have something you don't or can do something you can't and that is never the other person's fault, it's yours. Therapy is a wonderful tool to help you deal with any issues you may have and I suggest you take the initiative to partake in it, it will be helpful.",

Their mom and I are married and in a good place all these years later. But\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s NOT easy. In fact it\u2019s so goddamn hard and takes effort every day.\n\nI think that both scenarios can be true without degrading either. Not that you are at all, just that it\u2019s such a delicate thing. Life, I mean. Personalities clash on principle, and our stories are written by our choices. So many of those choices are easy to regret and some of them are easy to stand by. But those parameters are defined by the individual.\n\nI certainly don\u2019t judge the opinion that it\u2019s better to wait until you\u2019re mature and experienced and stable. Just like I don\u2019t judge those like me, who bred their own difficult situation and figured out a way (mostly through failure) to succeed and find a rhythm.\n\nLife is a balance of being a complete fucking idiot and being a confident journeyman. It rarely works out, and that\u2019s why stereotypes of both exist. But when it does it was earned.\n\nDoesn\u2019t diminish either opinion, but it does make it a murky one to draw a hard line in the sand on.\n\nEither way, your opinion on this is valid. OP\u2019s experience is valid, and her raw feelings on it are as well. Everything is case by case. In this particular case, I think it\u2019s clear that she is being wronged by someone who hasn\u2019t earned their right to stand on any kind of pedestal. Idk if anyone can earn that objectively, but objectively the cousin in this scenario is a dick.",

I\u2019m not able to have children either, and while I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not the ONLY reason I\u2019m not married, most people prefer to have a partner that they can build a family with. Seeing all of my friends have children can be hard. Sometimes it makes me feel very resentful. I currently live in a part of the country where getting married and having babies is just what women do. I can think of only four female friends from high school or college who have never had kids. That is not an exaggeration. So I\u2019m a real oddity. \n\nEVERYONE constantly asks me when I\u2019m going to settle down and have a family. People have asked me if I regret all of the years I spent working and traveling when I was younger, now that I\u2019m \u201cgetting up there\u201d. People have said I need to stop being so picky and settle before I end up dying alone. People have asked if I\u2019ve ever thought about who is going to take of me when I\u2019m old, if I don\u2019t have a family. Someone even asked if I was asexual once, because I was 35 and unmarried and childless. My parents told me that they gave up on getting grandchildren. \n\nIt\u2019s infuriating. Because obviously I would prefer to not have to explain my private situation to every single person I meet who wonders why I don\u2019t have kids. I\u2019m not ashamed - it\u2019s my body, and frankly, none of their business why my life is the way it is. But honestly, it\u2019s just kind of an awkward conversation to have with people. \u201cWell \u2026 I\u2019m infertile. What\u2019s new with you?\u201d Also, I do not want any more advice on foods I should/shouldn\u2019t eat, essential oils, vaccines (::eyeroll::), exercises, or prayers that I should try.\n\nAlso, even when people do know that someone can\u2019t have children, I find that there often seems to be this underlying belief that if you \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d or haven\u2019t had kids, it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t tried hard enough (or prayed hard enough ::vomit::). And society in general, I think, has a low opinion of childless women or at least an underlying belief, as your grandmother does, that never being pregnant makes you less of a woman.\n\nDealing with my jealousy of friends when I see them getting pregnant can be hard. Especially when I get excluded from group events at times, not in an intentionally hurtful way, but just because people\u2019s priorities and activities change when they have kids, and I don\u2019t have kids to bring along on the group family play date.\n\n\nHowever, as I\u2019ve gotten fed up after about 10 years of being asked when I\u2019m going to have kids or why I don\u2019t have kids, I\u2019ve just started saying really loudly \u201cI have a hostile uterus.\u201d It makes people SUPER uncomfortable, and they\u2019ll also never bring it up around you again.\n\nYou aren\u2019t alone! Hug!",

When things don\u2019t go the way we desire, it can certainly build up internal frustrations. So, you need a healthy outlet for those very valid feelings/emotions. Do not confide in anyone you can\u2019t trust, no one who will throw this information back in your face. Learn how to grey rock your family and anyone else who seeks to harm you with their words. If you have access to therapy, look into that option. I would suggest journaling also, but if you run the risk of someone finding your journal, maybe that\u2019s not a safe choice. I\u2019m a believer, so I also find comfort in prayer. Lastly, if you can find joy in other areas of your life, focus on that and live. Live and live well, as well as you can. It hurts, it sucks, you don\u2019t understand\u2026 I know. But don\u2019t let it be your everything. Volunteer, travel, enjoy your work, spend time working with your gifts/talents/hobbies, meet new people. There is more out there, and you can be happy. I wish you well!",

I was told I couldn\u2019t have children due to a rare blood disorder that causes miscarriage and a lack of eggs. I have two little boys running around the house right now. The second I had at 43. Yes, a lot of medication was used, but we didn\u2019t need IVF. I was given less than a 1% chance. \n\nDon\u2019t let your cousin get to you, see a fertility doctor (covered by insurance) and get a work up done. Finally, live your life and have fun. Don\u2019t let anyone be an asshole to you. Especially not family.",

Just because you may not be able to have kids of your own doesn't make you any less of a woman and they are horrible for trying to make you feel that way.\nI can understand how you feel though and I am sorry that you are going through that. I was diagnosed with horrible PCOS  at 8. By 18 I had my first endometriosis surgery as well as a pmdd diagnosis and later found out all my issues were related to  low progesterone. I was told since I was 8 I would never have kids. I told everyone I didn't want any but I really just hurt and kept it in. I had 5 miscarriages then gave birth to my first born daughter at 26 and was on progesterone to be able to carry to term. I had 5 more miscarriages  then  had no period for almost a year. Drs believed I was possibly perimenopausal even though I was young as a few women in my family went through it young as well. Out of nowhere after a year of nothing I got pregnant with my second born 6 years after my first born. No need for additional meds and other than issues with my own body sucking the pregnancy progressed well with no intervention needed so PCOS does make it harder but it's not always a for sure never gonna happen situation. I saw plenty of specialists who helped me and my diagnosis with low progesterone helped family members with the same issues not have trouble with pregnancies. We have a long family history of PCOS, endo, and miscarriages going back a few generations on my mom's side. Don't want to give you false hopes and wish no one the pain I went through with miscarriage after miscarriage but I do encourage you to have more talks with your Dr if you ever decide to try.",

Cut off the toxic and unkind family members, and you'll be much happier.\n\nAs for the infertility, I am sorry that you are struggling with this. From your comments I see you mention severe PCOS and that you don't know much about your condition. That impacts getting pregnant and makes miscarriage more likely, but does not otherwise impair making it to term.\nI have PCOS and three children and earliest any of them came was by 11 days. I did have 2 miscarriages in the mix, but my healthy pregnancies were quite healthy and low stress. I rarely ovulate, I'm not a responder to Clomid and I cannot take metformin so trying to conceive was not quick or easy, but learning my fertility (even as limited as it is) was very helpful in the process.\nMy cousin has it quite severely and she has a son and others I know with PCOS also have kids.\nAnother cousin was told she had no eggs remaining after cancer and treatment in her teens and she has three kids without any intervention.\nWhile PCOS can make it HARDER, it does not make it truly impossible as even infertility is not all that absolute.\nWith infertility, we DO have to accept that it could be never for us, and how little control we have in our own family planning (exactly when/if we get pregnant, child spacing, how many kids), but it sounds like you are lacking in information and support for your condition and that will only add to the pain you are experiencing.\nI would recommend finding a quality doctor in your area that is well-reviewed for PCOS and infertility, and getting updated hormone panel and exam, and starting fresh.\nI would also advise reading Taking Charge of Your Fertility, and joining evidence based support groups when it would come time for you to consider actively trying.\nKnowing when/if you ovulate and your luteal phase length will be key to how possible or difficult it may be, what options exist, etc.\nI'm sorry that you are hurting. The wait and unknown are painful, but don't give up fully until you have been thorough in learning about your condition and your particularly version of it as we all \"wear it a bit differently.\"\nGentle hugs.",

You don't have to be happy for awful people, *especially* when they try to treat you as \"less than\" your cousin because you were told it is possible you may not be able to conceive as easily, if at all. Also, news flash to them, there are plenty of ways to be a \"proper\" woman, and when a mother, without giving genetic birth. You could adopt, you could just be your awesome self, everything about you is just as it should be, and they should shove it for even acting as though it's not. Also also, it's possible that things could change. You're very young, there's plenty of treatments if you do choose to want to pursue having a biological child, but again, that is up to you, and is *absolutely not necessary* or at all a measure of your worth. Please know that I personally support every bit of negativity your feeling, because they're awful and your feelings are valid and natural (even if I'm only a stranger on the web that is haha). \n\nMy final advice? Just keep living your best life, and keep being awesome. Don't let them know their crappy attitudes bother you. Honestly, kill them with kindness. Pretend your stoked even if you're not. That is one of the best revenges for those types of petty people, to act like their shitty attitudes don't bother you or effect you at all. But definitely feel free to confide here, or with a close friend or even therapist, cause bottling it up all solo-like can be hard too. Please feel better!",

What you're experiencing, I am not going to say it's normal because it may sound like I am trying to minimize it, and I am not - but what you're feeling and how you're feeling is completely validated, real and understandable. Being a \"real\" woman is not a transactional thing, you don't have to bring anything or a human into the equation to be considered a woman. Who makes those decisions anyway, there isn't anyone who has the right to tell anyone what we are and aren't. \n\nMy mom tried having children for a very long time only to find out she couldn't and it was of course devastating. So her and my dad looked into adoption and they got an infant son, then the mother changed her mind and took him back a few months after. My dad got sick and eventually after some fighting and praying, they got a new infant which was me. I know a lot of people have adoption horror stories, and I've had my own issues with it but it wasn't because of anything my parents did. They were wonderful parents and did everything they could. I learned early on what it means to be family, and it sure isn't a bloodline. You don't have to physically give birth to be a mother, and anyone who says otherwise is sadly misguided. I know this is a huge decision and it's not right for everyone, I just have felt the pain my mother had gone through and how she wanted to be a mother so badly, and I can hear her words through your own. Just know that there is no one who can tell you that you can't be a mother, unconditional love for a child is not bound by the bonds of blood. \n\nI also have cut off several members of my family because they are toxic. Just because they are your family doesn't mean they have to be in your life. Real family can always be chosen. What your cousin has done, that is petty and cruel. I can't imagine ever wanting to make someone feel discouraged how she did. You are an amazing person to even be able to say you are still happy for her. I think you should try to set healthy boundaries with your family and tell them honestly how you feel, and if they don't respect them - then they may not deserve your time. My few family members who I don't speak to think we should have an unconditional love for each other that unfortunately in their eyes comes with dealing and putting up with everything from disrespect to abuse. Family relationships are absolutely based on conditions, and if someone can't follow them then they don't deserve your time and energy. I know you didn't ask for advice, and I apologize for being so forward. I just want you to know that all the things those people are telling you, they're wrong. You are a strong woman and deserve everything life has to offer you, and I hope one day this will all be a source of strength for you.",

Someone who you can pore your feelings out to and not be judged.  2nd if you really want a baby find a specialist. There maybe a way to have a child and just not push it out. C section before you go in labor.  Don't give up til all avenues have been check. My sister in love was told she could never have children when she was young. But she's the mother of 3 healthy grown children now. I pray things work out for you. Finally I will say this. If your family continue with the way they talk to you or about you, cut them out.

I'm not sure if you're in the US but lots of employers now have a separate fertility specialist help program make sure you find out all the available benefits at your human resources office.\n\nIf you've exhausted all your possible avenues to accomplish your goals look into other ways to make your own family.

When I lost my baby, it was hard and nobody really was there to support me so I was on my own. Think of it this way, yes you don\u2019t have children, maybe date somebody who is a single dad, I did and I have three great stepkids because of it. It won\u2019t replace the feeling of giving birth but it will want to help you be a mother. Even if you did, big brothers/sisters it would help you find your joy in being around children. Even volunteering at a children\u2019s hospital or hospice could help. You might to go into therapy to help with your feelings but there are so many ways you can still be a mother and give your love to others without being pregnant. Who knows maybe one day you will be pregnant and all your troubles and worries will disappear when every appointment and check up and everything is ok. I believe you will have your baby genetic or other wise, you will be a mother to somebody who needs it. Hugs sending love and light to you.",

            "comment": "I had a similar experience with my sister-in-law. I had chemo and radiation after cancer and my husband and I were told it was very unlikely I\u2019d ever be able to conceive. \n2 months after that my (younger) sister-in-law told us she was pregnant. She didn\u2019t know who the father was but was going to keep the baby. I was incredibly jealous but kept it to myself. \n\nThroughout the first trimester she complained to me constantly about how shit it was and how I should be grateful I\u2019m not able to have children. She lost the baby at 14 weeks and was devastated, I tried supporting her but she told me I\u2019d never understand because I could never get pregnant.\n\nBy some divine miracle I was able to get pregnant and now have a healthy 9 month old son. She cut us off when she found out I was pregnant, we haven\u2019t spoken to her since and she\u2019s refused to meet our boy. \n\nSometimes the best thing to do is cut these people off. Jealousy is hard, but when it comes to pregnant remember might not isn\u2019t the same as can not!",

There are many, many ways to have kids if you truly want to be a mom someday.  You are young, and there are many others paths you can explore, including getting other opinions from doctors on your ability to carry a pregnancy to term.   And just because you can give birth, it doesn\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ve got the emotional maturity to be a great parent.  Your cousin\u2019s lack of empathy towards your condition is proof  of that.   Distance yourself from those who make themselves feel better by knocking others down, and look for support from those who truly care about you.",

I think, unfortunately, your cousin\u2019s immature behavior exacerbated your feelings towards the situation. Had she been a decent human being you might secretly wish it was you but still be happy for her. \n\nI have a big cousin (4 years my senior) who struggles with fertility.. to this day I\u2019ve never sent her a single picture of my baby because I know how much it pains her that she hasn\u2019t had her own yet. My baby is now almost 2.. I\u2019m very cautious and sensitive about it to her because I can\u2019t imagine the pain.. you deserve that consideration from the ones who love you.. \n\nEdit to add: Motherhood come in all forms, don\u2019t get too discouraged.

All had to be in baby ICU premie care for about 6 weeks or a little longer. 6 are strong, bright, and healthy young adults and 2 babies that came early a few years ago born to one of the six who came early. There are a lot of measures medical can take now to keep the baby in longer and medical miracles if they come early. So don't give up quite yet. And keep it quiet should you get pregnant as long as you can to keep your stress level down from well intended relatives.\ud83d\udc95",

Firstly, if you truly want a child to love , there are options available, not all are preferred but there ARE options . Consider one day giving all that love to a child who needs a family and parents, just not your dad's family because disrespectfully, fuck em. I'm 35, the oldest grandchild,  I was the first married, also the first widow at 30, my cousin's decades younger have all had Children before me , and like you, a condition prevents me from having them.

I also carry the same dream, and I\u2019m 28, so I can understand a portion of the weight you carry with you daily. Sending you so much love and light.

You can still find that worth without carrying a child, as much as you may want to. \n\nLife is more than having children, don't let yourself harbour bitterness too long. Let yourself grieve, let yourself be angry, but a time will come when you need to live again.

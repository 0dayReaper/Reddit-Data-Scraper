    "postText": "My(21) bf(22) and I have our lives very intertwined. We have been together for two years. We live together, we share friends together, we have a pet together, we have plans together. I have gained so much from him. I have grown so much with him. I fell in love with the way he cared for me, the way he made me laugh and the adventures he promised. We\u2019ve had many adventures. He\u2019s hard working and very smart. When we want to get something done we are a powerful team. \nAnd because of all of that I am guilty. He often gives me the ick. I feel like his mother. I clean up after him, I cook (if I don\u2019t want something burnt or over seasoned), I keep him together. It\u2019s exhausting as I also work (not as much as him) and have disability such as severe scoliosis, chronic migraines many mental health issues, etc.\nAfter the honey moon stage of our relationship I noticed he has more of a short temper. He acted entitled (esp due to his hard work ethic giving him money enough to buy land at a young age), he\u2019s not romantic, and is somewhat awkward in bed. He\u2019s very good at saying all the wrong things. And I\u2019ve had to train him to communicate better. On and off I\u2019ve begged for him to try harder in our relationship and after two years of asking he\u2019s finally reminding me of who I fell in love with. Unfortunately I think it might be too late. Of course I enjoy that he\u2019s finally acting as I hoped. But I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s only changed because I\u2019ve withdrawn. I\u2019m also not sure if I see him the same anymore. We still have great banter but our relationship to me often feels more like family. He annoys the shit out of me and I would have his back through anything. I have. I have moments where I can be with him the way I want, but then others when it feels weird to have him touch me like that. I often find myself fantasizing about others, because it gives me the butterflies I\u2019m trying to remember. I\u2019m stuck loving him so much and not wanting to lose everything we\u2019ve built, and feeling like Im leading him on, not knowing how I actually want to continue. How do I figure out what I want? I don\u2019t want to lose him. But I also wonder what else there is. Do I break up with him? Or give him the benefit of the doubt in his changes and try to rekindle my attraction?",

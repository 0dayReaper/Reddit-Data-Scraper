    "postText": "The delivery guy in this neighborhood is pretty obnoxious sometimes. Just throwing packages at people's doors that are later destroyed by rain. Getting angry if you aren't at the door fast enough (I usually sit in the attic and I have 5 floors... You can hear that I'm on my way...). \n\nWorst moment was recently when there was construction happening and the Ambulances to the nearby hospital had to make a detour trough a narrow street. The guy had his van parked in the middle of that street. I arrived just in time to see the police arrest him for that after he was arguing with the ambulance driver instead of moving his van out of the way. \n\nTo get to my front door, there is a stairway that is one story high. A couple of months ago I ordered a 20 kilo bag of sand off the internet and the guy looked like he could kill me after he had dragged that bag to my front door. \n\nEver since, whenever I see this guy acting like an entitled asshole, I will order a crate of wine from the internet. They usually contain 6 to 8 bottles and with the glass and wood the packages are like 8 to 10 kilo's. It's my little micro aggression and it makes me feel satisfied to see him carry those crates up the stairs every time.",

UPS states it clearly, provides a dolly for their use( if not they should talk to their union rep, which they certainly have). They also state that anything shipped over 150 lbs is considered freight and not shipped through regular parcel couriers. ( Edit- I am by no means saying they have to be happy, but they knew what they were getting into and if they feel they are treated unjustly should seek their union representative for advice, couriers have gone on strike.)",

Their logic is that it slows the carriers down, and the union reps don't do anything for the carriers unless a lawsuit is brought up which they think they will lose. And as for the lifting, yes they were told those requirements but at least in my dad's case, when he joined 15-20 years ago there were not as many big item deliveries. \"Regularly\" did not mean almost every stop had a package, nor did the weight requirements mean almost every package would be heavy. But nowadays, everyone orders everything online. The USPS was originally just for mail but since people weren't sending mail as frequently, they added packages in 2013 to save them from going under. But again, the circumstances of 2023 are very different than 2013 in terms of the amount of packages and frequency of heavy items, yet the postal service won't make any changes accordingly or make it easier for the carriers. And strikes don't happen as often as people think, it's not just something you decide to do on a whim because you're upset. You lose out on money for your family and bills, your livelihood, when you do that and there's no guarantee the  risk will end favorably for you. The problem is the federal government doesn't care about it's postal employees, not that the mail carrier doesn't care about your package\n\nYes, I  copy and pasted a lot from other comment. I didn't feel like creating a whole new response",

Their logic is that it slows the carriers down, and the union reps don't do anything for the carriers unless a lawsuit is brought up which they think they will lose. And as for the lifting, yes they were told those requirements but at least in my dad's case, when he joined 15-20 years ago there were not as many big item deliveries. \"Regularly\" did not mean almost every stop had a package, nor did the weight requirements mean almost every package would be heavy. But nowadays, everyone orders everything online. The USPS was originally just for mail but since people weren't sending mail as frequently, they added packages in 2013 to save them from going under. But again, the circumstances of 2023 are very different than 2013 in terms of the amount of packages and frequency of heavy items, yet the postal service won't make any changes accordingly or make it easier for the carriers. The problem is the federal government doesn't care about it's postal employees, not that the mail carrier doesn't care about your package.",

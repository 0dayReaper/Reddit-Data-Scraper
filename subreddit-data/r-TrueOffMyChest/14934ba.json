    "postText": "I\u2019ve been struggling with my health for 7 years and I\u2019m now 18 years old. We think I have fibromyalgia, EDS and POTS. I also have IBS, acid reflux and moderate scoliosis. I have constant back, shoulder, neck and rib pain and recently I\u2019ve had awful chest/upper body muscle twitching and spasms that\u2019ve made me afraid to do much, so my mum (who has been incredibly supportive through my life) will do almost everything for me, like tying up my hair and putting my socks on.  \n\nI \u201cdropped out\u201d of school last September, what would have been my final year, because I couldn\u2019t sit at the desks with my neck and back or write without being in awful pain. I never used to do much with friends anyway since I have health anxiety and would feel sick all the time, but I haven\u2019t seen any people my age since. \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve lost my teenage years. I feel so sad when I see people my age living their life while I\u2019m stuck at home crying in pain. I\u2019ve wanted to be an author since I was a child but I can\u2019t sit at a desk or support a laptop or type very easily with my muscle, neck and chest sensitivity anymore. \n\nI know there are so, so many people with much worse conditions and lives, but it still makes me feel so hopeless. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll ever get a job or meet people. \n\nAnyone who wants to share their story or give advice, I\u2019m here.",

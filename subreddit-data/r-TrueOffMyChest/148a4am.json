    "postText": "Intro\r  \n\r  \nI am just writing it down. Write down what I\u2019m feeling about my life, so I won\u2019t feel anxiety. I do want to mention I am taking actionable steps to get where I wanted to be, but I have to start small. I\u2019m sure there are people who are going through WORSE than me and I empathize their struggles and hope for the best for them. I think, this is my story. Please note that I'm not really good at intreperting\r  \n\r  \nIdentity\r  \n\r  \nI am a (2nd?) gen, 21 y/o Vietnamese American male, Gen Z, Catholic, now single, somewhat have both conservative and liberal values, 6\u20190, 175 lbs skinny (fat?), INFJ person who doesn't have his driver\u2019s license, but prefers taking public transportation, haven't worked out in a few months, software development major who just switched from CS, living with parents with 4 other siblings and a dog, living in a ivory home with a nice neighborhood, ADHD?, kind of ugly?, hygiene is good, but could work on my fashion. Gamer who is hardstuck but who is cutting down the game time for a few weeks now. Not sure why, but I find it more enjoyable to craft things software or in arts.\r  \n\r  \nStruggles\r  \n\r  \nI felt like getting an summer internship at sophmore year and junior year was like a norm as a CS student, but it didn't know it was so competitive and 300+ applications and a few interviews later, no offer at all. I updated my resume like 5 times over the course of 10 months and even career centers were like \"yeah doesn't look good enough\" LIKE WHAT? YOU TOLD ME TO CHANGE IT. I MEAN YEAH RESUMES ARE UPDATED ONCE IN A WHlLE BUT NOT TILL THE POINT I NEED TO CHANGE IT EVERYTIME I NEED TO APPLY OR SOME COMPUTER PROGRAM TELLS ME THAT MY RESUME ISN'T 80% MATCH TO THE JOB DESCRIPTION. EVEN IF IT'S A 80%, IM GOING AGAINST LIKE 700 MORE APPLICANTS FOR A STUPID COMPANY THAT DOESN'T MAKE FUCKING SENSE. MAYBE IM NOT MATURING ENOUGH MAYBE IM NOT CORPORATE ENOUGH MAYBE IM NOT AMERICAN ENOUGH. MAYBE IM NOT LOOKING AT THE WRONG JOBS? SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERN? SOFTWARE DEVELOPER INTERN? HOW THE FUCK DO I SEARCH FOR JOBS EVEN IF I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO. IM A FUCKING SENIOR AND I JUST FIGURED OUT WHAT TO DO. I JUST DONT KNOW IF I WOULD FIND A GOOD COMPANY THAT INTERESTS ME.\r  \n\r  \nI recently cut the use of IG and other social media apps so I can focus on doing my own things. Before that, I felt so envious for my friends who were able to go outside town or the country to enjoy their lives. Like yes, I'm happy for them! It's just I felt like I will never get to experience this type of thing until I'm older. BeReal was also a cool social media app, but I felt like most of my friends took moments when they are 'actually' good moments and idk why I felt bad about myself. \"Am I mediorcre? Am I just boring? Do I have a boring life? Am I just poor, a broke college student?\". I have a lot of friend groups, but rarely hang out because I don't really belong to any. I felt like I was a side friend in each friend group. Most of the time, I just feel lonely.\r  \n\r  \nmy mental is so weak. I've been dealing with PMO for a couple of years now and a three years back I decided to fight it, but I fumbled a lot. The highest I could go is 90 days without it. Right now, I decided to invest myself to a support group for a couple of buck per month my group is pretty cool and I am grateful for it. I still fumbled, and that's the reason why I also deleted social media (or at least cut from it), is because I'm looking at some content that tempts me to go to their OF, or their actual hub page. (Yes, I'm down bad or was i guess). Also I don't mind, but i don't fucking know why White Male and Asian/asian american Female couples irritates me so much. Like I'm happy for them and it's not my fucking business and it shouldn't be my fucking business, but maybe I was taught to hate on the idea from social media? I don't fucking know. My SISTER IS DATING A WHITE MAN, AND I ACTUALLY VIBE WITH HIM SO HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS ME DEAL WITH THE STUPID IGNORANCE I HAVE TAHT SHOULDNT BE PLANTED IN MY BRAIN FROM SOCIAL FUCKING MEDIA AND THE HUB. Please, I don't intend to send hate to the couples that are reading this. I'm happy for you, it's just a me problem and it's something I have to deal with alone. I don't want to think this hateful way and with other hateful ways that I have. ALSO I THINK I GOT INTO A REDPILL RABBIT HOLE. LOOK SOME INFLUENCERS MAKES GOOD POINTS AND I SHOULD DEFINTELY Discipline MYSELF and BE ON A SELF DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY,ITS NOT A COMMUNITY I LIKE TO JOIN.\r  \n\r  \nThe next few paragraphs will hopefully makes sense.\r  \n\r  \nCurrent situation\r  \n\r  \nrecent break up. I'm still not over her, I felt reckless and we told ourselves we weren't ready for another relationship bc are good friends, but I asked her out, and it lasted about a month. We stayed back friends, but she wanted to move on (but still wants me). Both of us needed to be more responsible to our actions, but damn I miss that connection. Maybe we'll come back together, if not then that's okay. We both want to be our very best, and it seems like we can be our best when we're alone. I felt like I was a horrible boyfriend to her and I WAS EVEN HER 1ST BOYFRIEND. SHE WAS A GEM AND A ANGEL TO ME WHEN WE WERE FRIENDS AND NOW WE CHANGED BECAUSE OF MY RECKLESSNESS AND INSECURIIES AND MY FUCKING ADDICTION TO PMO. GOD I FELT SO DISGUSTED ON MYSELF.\r  \n\r  \nI think, I'm just also scared of working the corporate life for the next decades. Talking 'adult stuff' like insurance, health, jobs, fucking cars and expenses, humble brags,afraid to be a linkedIn Lunatic basically. Idk how some of my friends were manage to get a good corporate job and travel outside of the US and joy their youths. However, it's something I might have to go through with like all other functional adults do, but without doing what my heart wants to do. Maybe that's maturaty. Maybe I have to sacrifice a bit of my youth for some stability in my american 'dream'. Get a job, car, house, American wife, children, work, investments, other boring topic. AND PLEASE IF I HEAR A FUCKING \"Well, yeah, it's boring, but some tasks are actually interesting to me\", IMMA EXPLODE BECAUSE EITHER YOURE LYING OR IT\"S SOMETHING I HAVE TO FACE. LINKEDIN LUNATICS ARE FUCKING RAHHHHHH IT'S LIKE YOU ACTING LIKE \"HEY IM A BETTER SLAVE THAN YOU\". FUCKING REAL ESTATE. THAT DOESN\"T MAKE FUCKING SENSE BUT I HAVE TO LEARN IT AND IM STILL CONFUSED, IMMA CHATGPT MYSELF INTO EXPLAN REAL ESTATE LIKE FUCKING 5\r  \n\r  \nWhat my heart wants to do\r  \n\r  \nI wanted to a least live a nomadic life (for a few years), and not worry about all of this: Money, and the American 'Dream'. To visit numerous countries and to meet new people.\r  \n\r  \nAnd then live a type of aesthetic of \"old money\" or a \"luxurious life\"\r  \n\r  \nI wanted to build a business and be a founder of a tech company or whatever.\r  \n\r  \nI wanted to provide stability not only for myself, but for my family. While me living in my dream and do what I love.\r  \n\r  \nI keep bitching about it and what 'my American self' wants to do\r  \n\r  \nI feel like, I'm destined to not go anywhere or move anywhere....\r  \n\r  \nI talked with a catholic priest near my campus about my problems in school and life and basically the goal as a believer is to \"get into heaven\". Like the ultimate goal to life is to go to heaven. To be closer to Jesus. I believe in it. I was born with it. However, it feels like I won't be able to do what my heart wants. My local priest who I usually go to Mass with because it's the only Vietnamese Catholic Church in the state (I think?) lightly implies that we shouldn't live a life that we want because God has a plan. So, am I destined to be miserable until I maybe go to heaven? Actually, I am not certain. Maybe because I automatically go to hell because of my addiction or any commandment i broke? Maybe because I didn't follow the right religion? The right denomination? Even some told me that I'll go to hell because of my faith. Some Catholics (or trads) that I'm doing this all wrong. But then again, it's like I have to stay in state and be dull as possible.\r  \n\r  \nBecause of the fact my family immigrated here from the war, I have conflicting feelings. Yes, someday I want to move back to VN. Note that I am MEDIORCRE AT MY VIETNAMESE. in addition, I'll be considered a \"viet kieu\" or \"people of Vietnamese descent or who grew up in Vietnam but moved overseas.\". I'm not sure how Vietnamese people think about this... IM NOT SURE WHAT MY PARENTS WILL THINK ABOUT THIS. MY DAD'S FAMILY MOVED TO THE US FOR A BETTER LIFE AND FOR POLITICAL REASONS FROM THE WAR OBVOULSLY JUST FOR ME TO GO BACK TO THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS FOUGHT?\r  \n\r  \nWhat actions I will take\r  \n\r  \nAside from all of this. I'm taking some small, actionable steps to hopefully figure out what to do in my life and to see what are my priorities.\r  \n\r  \nGetting new skills and making projects I want to build to help others in my 'community'.: I mean, I see problems, and I have solutions. Not really sure if its something they like, but it does give me some time get more project experience and figuring out what I like to code and build. It could be a potential SaaS business and it's something small and im happy to fail. Also participating online hackathons are really cool so i'll be doing that in the summer.\r  \n\r  \ncontinue build a youtube audience on my dev journey. I know how building a brand works from other experiences, but idk I want to try it to keep myself busy alongside work an project.\r  \n\r  \nStarting a new club. I think all of my classmates need some community in the Software development field in campus and figure out what type of developer they can be and build awesome projects outside of school\r  \n\r  \nGo back to the gym. No brainer. I want to look good naked for myself obviously.\r  \n\r  \nLearn how to be a better student: I had shit grades right now. 5 classes wasn't the move for the greatest academic comeback of all time.\r  \n\r  \nRead more books: I miss them, idk why I found it boring before.\r  \n\r  \nJust touch grass and hang out with friends: I need to do that more.\r  \n\r  \nUni therapy kind of doesn't work.\r  \n\r  \nQuick rant, but counselors never follow up on me even though they told me they will :/ So it's my responsibility to check up on myself.\r  \n\r  \nWhat im grateful for.\r  \n\r  \nA loving family, though I am misunderstood sometimes, but it's something I need to learn by learning Vietnamese.\r  \n\r  \nA house, clothes, a new job that pays a little more than my previous job, my friends that checks up on me, my support group, talking with God sometimes, meeting new people online, building a community, taking the first step to greatness... (i think)\r  \n\r  \nFinal notes\r  \n\r  \nI felt way better writing this down. it made me understood myself a bit more everyday. but there are some things that might be controversial towards religion, relationships, careers. So please, criticize me. Educate me. because I'm the dumbest person alive. I'm always learning new things and new perspectives. And I don't go to this platform a lot, but I'll do my best to listen to everyone.\r  \n\r  \nSo, Am I playing life on hard mode? or I'm making all of this hard on myself?\r  \n\r  \nTL;DR: I think it made this hard on myself, but I'll keep going",

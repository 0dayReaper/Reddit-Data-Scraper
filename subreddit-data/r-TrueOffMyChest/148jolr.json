Let me tell you, it took about 6 hours and hurt the entire time, one sitting. There\u2019s no shame in confessing that tattoos hurt. It\u2019s known it hurts, it\u2019s part of the pride in getting them personally. I have one on my back that\u2019s about bowling ball sized and it only hurt bad when the needle hit my spine bone. \n\nIn my experience any time the needle makes direct contact with bone hurts because of all the vibrations. Needle on just skin/fat/muscle was mostly just a matter of mental toughness feeling like your getting pinched for hours.",

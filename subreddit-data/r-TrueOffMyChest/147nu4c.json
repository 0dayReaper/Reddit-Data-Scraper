    "postText": "I do wanna leave this anonymous because I know my now girlfriend (Lilly) is on Reddit and I don\u2019t know if she would see this.\n\nI had a very rough childhood growing up. I didn\u2019t have a dad, and my mom was never really there because she had a rough battle with health issues and got hooked on narcotics.\n\nI had friends growing up, but I had my best friend since I was 12. Her name is Lilly. We have been extremely close due to our childhood issues and we had always been there for each other. We had talks of being together, but got cold feet because we were scared if it didn\u2019t work, we couldn\u2019t recover from that. \n\nWhen I was 18, I didn\u2019t really wanna go to college. School had never been for me. So I went into a trade. I work long hours, but it\u2019s been worth it and I make solid money right now for my position. I\u2019ll come back to this in a bit.\n\nWhen we were 19, Lilly got pregnant by her boyfriend. The dude somehow managed to avoid child support payments and broke up with her, and has not seen the kid once in his life. Complete deadbeat. Makes me disgusted. \n\nLilly was scared, but I told her I would be here when she needed. She didn\u2019t have parents that would help, but I told her I\u2019d help where I can when the kid gets here. \n\nLo and behold, she gave birth to a beautiful little girl named Kelsey. I was there when she was born and it was a\u2026weird moment. I don\u2019t know to explain it, but I did feel happy for her. \n\nNow we\u2019re 21, and ever since then this little girl has had me wrapped around her finger. I\u2019ve done my round of the diapers, bottles, middle of the night screaming, etc. \n\nEvery day I get home from work we sit there and we watch her little shows, and we spend a lot of time together as the 3 of us as well. When we walk, she grabs my pointer finger with her whole hand because it\u2019s so little. She stands up and kisses me on the cheek after I change her, and she loved her snuggles where she just lays on top of me with her head laid up against my chest. \n\nAs of recently, she has begun speaking. She has been calling me daddy. I\u2019ve been feeling really weird about it lately. Feeling like it\u2019s not right, and that someday she needs to know the truth. \n\nI talked to Lilly about it one night and got her opinion of it. She sat there with a slight grin and then she came up behind me and hugged me. She said \u201cyou\u2019re the best dad she could ever ask for.\u201d And then proceeded to tell me \u201cwe\u2019ll worry about talking to her when she understands. As far as she is concerned, you are her daddy, and you are to me as well\u201d \n\nI turned around and hugged her. We had a long talk about what\u2019s been going on lately with us as we have been engaging in\u2026not so \u201cjust friends\u201d activities and she just said \u201cI like this, I like our family.\u201d I just kinda froze for a sec and asked her \u201cis this what we wanna do?\u201d and she followed up by saying \u201cI think we\u2019ve been doing this for awhile now\u201d and then laughed. We had a great moment and agreed to be a family. \n\nI had told her I needed to run to the drugstore for some diapers for Kelsey. On the way there, I bursted into tears. I cried for maybe a good 30 minutes. I don\u2019t even know how I describe what I was thinking and feeling, but I was happy. I just know that there isn\u2019t a thing in this world I wouldn\u2019t do for those two. It feels like I can relax and reflect on everything that\u2019s happened to this point. But also I don\u2019t. I basically have a family I\u2019m looking out for. Like no matter what happens, I have people who will depend on me, and something like that makes me wanna be the best man I can. \n\nIn about another year, I will have my official license for my trade, giving me a substantial pay raise and a new job that I already have lined up. I\u2019ve already started looking at houses and rings. We\u2019ve also talked about having our own once I get my license. \n\nI don\u2019t know where I\u2019m going with this, but I wanted to share it with someone, but I don\u2019t really have those people in my life. \n\nThanks for reading :)",

I know you are attached to the kid and would really be hard if you broke up. Even if you remain friends, if she gets a new boyfriend he may not appreciate how close y\u2019all are. And insist on you not being around as you aren\u2019t her daughters legal father. \n\nI know no one wants to think about this while I\u2019m a relationship but as you get more and more attached it would get harder and harder on you to let go if something did happen. \n\nGood luck OP! I\u2019m rooting for y\u2019all.\n\nEdit: I should say after marriage or a good long thought process and discussion. Don\u2019t jump into it because adoption will also mean child support if something went wrong. Don\u2019t take it lightly. You\u2019re just in a tough spot.",

I\u2019m really not too worried about something going wrong, because it shouldn\u2019t, but also if I got stuck with child support, I wouldn\u2019t care.

I recommend the child\u2019s book called \u201cWhat Makes a Baby\u201d that opens conversation about how families are formed. We have an unconventional family and it really helped us start that conversation super early (now isn\u2019t too early!!) so the kids grew up understanding the different family and biological connections they have and where they fit in it all.",

Their daughter was an adult by this point so get mom couldn't limit their contact if she has tried, but it would have protected him if they had split up earlier and she decided to be malicious about custody.",

Get to know your kids as they go through all their changes.   Never hide your true self and let your kids always feel that you were once a kid too with that same insecurities.   I can\u2019t stress this enough.   Talk to them like they matter, like their world matters.   I see so many parents just raise their kids instead to developing a relationship with them.   \n\nBest of luck.  You\u2019re a good man.",

But it sounds like you're subconsciously doing all of this to fulfill a psychological need you never had met which is in your mind, a healthy family. So all I'm saying is, before you heavily involve yourself in this situation just consider weather you are really doing this due to psychological issues you have that you need fulfilled or you're really doing it for the child and what that does or doesn't mean. Because it matters. I'm only saying all of this because you don't have parental figures and you're young and making a life altering decision.",

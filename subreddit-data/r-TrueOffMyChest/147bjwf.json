    "postText": "I'm M22 and I started dating this girl named Ashley(who is now my ex), which I would call \"the love of my life\". Bullshit. We started dating in 8th grade and we were together for 8 years. We were both the same age and when I first started talking to her, it truly was, love at first sight. She and I were the so called ,\"The Perfect Couple\", it was a nice title to have till last week. \n\nIt was a Wednesday night and she was over my house and she usually goes on my Instagram account, which if you don't know what Instagram is, its basically a Social Messaging app. Anyways, she went onto my account and I asked her, \"Can I go onto your account?\" She hesitated for a second till she said, \"yeah hold on\". I didn't really think nothing much of it but 10 minutes later she gave me her account. But thinking about what just happened, i decided to go through her following. She had around 2.5k followers and being me, I went into her messages being shocked when I only saw 8 chat boxes. Till this guy texted. The text said \" Miss you babe, See you tomorrow.\" I looked at her and told her to get the fuck out. She tried to deny the fact she was cheating on me and that her and that guy were \"just friends.\"Before she walked out the door she said \"Your stupid for just realizing now.\" And walked out.\n\n\nI cried for the entire night and even typing this out. I've been wanting to kill my self because I thought I found the love of my life, and all along, I've just been getting played, fuck love, its nothing but a toy to mess around with. \n\n \nThank you, for reading my experience.",

I was the one who left, I didn\u2019t get cheated on. I just needed something else, but he was my everything up until then. I made the right choice, but it was fucking hard. \n\nYou are going through something even harder. Take time to learn who you are without her. What are your true interests and hobbies. What does your ideal future look like. Is it time to take a new job in a new city? Go back to school? Travel? Join a rec soccer team? \n\nMy number one advice is to use this time to explore. You are going to feel like shit, lonely, and angry. Might as well feel those things while training for a Marathon or becoming the best D&amp;D Dungeon master in your city. Whatever floats your boat. \n\nPlease remember- her cheating is a reflection on HER. Healthy people leave a relationship before fucking other people. I always have. It isnt that hard. Hard to leave? Don\u2019t fuck other people, easy. Hard to avoid fucking that new person at work? Leave, easy.",

Some days are going to be better than others. Its going to be hard to imagine a life apart from her. If you have close friends and family then go spend time with them. A support network is absolutely vital in this time. Partake in your hobbies, or pick up a new one. \n\nYou need to take time to focus on yourself. Growing up together from a young age means that so much of who you are is tied up in who she is (or who you thought she was). Figure out who you are on your own and what you want going forward. Don't get into a new relationship anytime soon, because you're going to bring baggage over from your previous relationship that you need to unlearn first.\n\nYou're worthy. You're loved. You're important. Hold your head up high.\n\nYou aren't alone in these experiences. You can get through it, and rise above it. I say all this as someone going through something very similar.

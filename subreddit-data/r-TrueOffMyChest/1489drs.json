    "postText": "This is a rant with a lot of excitement so this may be quite shallow but if you have time, hear me out and tell me what's going on.\n\nSo I (18F) celebrated my 18th birthday yesterday. I invited him (17M) to come but he told me he is uninterested. I told him multiple times about the event and he just shrugged it off like it was not something to look forward to so I stopped. Yesterday, he sent a picture of a badminton place, so I was convinced that he was not coming but when I went to the gate to meet my visitors I suddenly saw him. Take note that I like this person alot and he is the guest I really wanted to come and he knows it so when I saw him, I felt so happy and was so excited. He approached me and gave me gifts with letters attached to each item. I was so happy bcs he is not the type to make letters and his gifts were things that he likes. He also spent alot of money to pay for the transportation of all my friends to come so I was shocked with the efforts he did. But, during the event, he never talked to me. We were singing in the karaoke and he was just busy fixing his rubiks cube and when I went out, he suddenly started singing and when I came back, he stopped midway so I went away again and he continued. When I came back again he quickly put his facemask on so I found it very funny. I shared this because I can't understand him anymore. We are soooo close in chats, but when we meet, we never speak a word to each other, and him coming to my birthday, made so much effort and spent alot for him and my friends to come was so weird. I am soooo happy but also so confused because we are like this for years.",

The fact that he showed up with gifts and letters would indicate that you were special to him (unless those were written and bought by his parents or someone else but that would be really odd). Anyhow, keep observing and if you really like him, maybe find a good place and time to express your feelings and thoughts.",

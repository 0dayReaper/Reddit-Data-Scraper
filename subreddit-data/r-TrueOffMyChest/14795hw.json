    "postText": "I dont affiliate myself with any political party because, and call me selfish, but if something doesn\u2019t directly  affect me, like politics, then i honestly dont really care about it. \n\ni cant help but cringe when i see someone define their entire identity based on whether theyre a conservative or liberal, or any political party.\n\ni used to be into politics and realized how many arguments and the dumb personality that it gave me, i used to hate people if they didnt agree with my opinions, so i stopped.\n\nNow i dont care whatever  politics you believe  in, as long as you dont let it define your personality, then i will dislike you for that. but other than that i dont care. you want trump 2024? cool, dont care. Biden 2024? cool, dont care. Kanye west 2024? cool, dont care. \n\nanyone else feel like this? i just feel like people care about politics way too much. \n\nof course i do have my own personal world views though, but theyre pretty scattered anyways, some are more right leaning and some are more left leaning, thats why i dont wanna put myself into one.",

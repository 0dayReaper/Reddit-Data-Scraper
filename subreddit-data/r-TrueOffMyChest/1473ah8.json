    "postText": "I recently started dating this girl about 2 months ago and i have zero desire to be with her. I thought id grow to love her but nothing. Shes not beautiful but her personality is the best ive seen so far and i cant bring myself to end it this early in the relationship. She clearly is in love with me and this make me feel like a monster.",

The right thing to do is to break it off before the relationship gets any deeper, it\u2019ll only hurt her more if you wait. Let her go so she can find someone who will genuinely love her for who she is. You are playing that girl, you don\u2019t truly love her. You should\u2019ve never gotten with her, you\u2019re tolerating her.",

    "postText": "True of my chest i (F20) who was 18 at the time worked for a laundry service and my then boss gave me a new form of trauma i didn't know could exists. i was fresh off of high school when i got this job it was organized by my sister for me to be a receptionist at her friends' laundry service. i won't name names so well just call her Nini. Nini was a foreigner in our country and open a laundry service at a popular mall and was looking for trusted people to work for her hence where i came in.\n\nmy initial impression of her was that she was so beautiful and nice, and she treated me well when i first started working there (now looking back all her actions were love bombing.) i was young stupid and naive and treated her more like an older sister than my boss as i met her through my older sister. she cried in my arms told me about her past trauma and her relationship problems with her husband and i tried my best to comfort her and work hard to make her business a success. all was well till my second month of working there.\n\nthis is when her mistreatment of me started. it started small as her getting upset i wasn't at the receptionist desk and was helping out back on the clothes. fair enough i was hired for a specific job but we were so understaffed (she kept firing everyone over small things) that the clothes weren't being cleaned in time for pick up so i stepped up to help. then it got to a point where she would get upset with me over sitting at the front desk essentially doing nothing as we had no customers for days on end. this continued on everyday with her scolding me for small things but no matter what i did to change it or improve she would find new things to get upset about like how much coffee or tea the staff (me and the washers) would drink.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe first major thing to happen was when her husband came by to take her to breakfast. i was working reception and had to use the bathroom. she didn't allow us to use the bathroom in the store and had to use the malls one. i told my colleague i was leaving but when i got to the bathroom it was closed for cleaning so i had to go to the one on the second floor. when i came back my boss was so angry at me and asked where i was. i simply told her i went to the bathroom and that i let my colleague know.\n\n she responded: ''i went to the bathroom to check and you weren't there.''\n\nme: '' yes i was at the second one as they were closed for cleaning''\n\nshe then called me into her office to chat. i went in and sat down just for her to say: ''are you trying to fuck my husband ?!''  i was flabbergasted and asked her to explain what she meant. she then said that he left breakfast and insisted she went to work, and he just leave to go to his and that in the time i went to the bathroom he went as well. and that she doesn't believe i was at the bathroom and that she believed i approached her husband with the proposition of an affair. i stressed to her i went to the bathroom and that i have no interest in her husband.\n\nshe then tried to smooth things over and told me that she doesn't trust her husband and that i should be wary of him. i left the office and continue working and some time passed but her treatment of me didn't improve. i was already looking for a new job at this time and told my sister what happened but i was still working there.\n\nthe next time something happened was when we were doing a promotional stand in the mall to boost the laundry's reach. we were all packing goodies for give aways and then the manager of the mall came to me walking past my boss and said that we should just stay on the floor we were assigned and not leave and do promotions down stairs. i told her thank you and i would let my boss know as well, when i went to tell my boss she was upset and yelled at me Infront of everyone because the manager choose to talk to me and not her. i told her that idk why she came to me and that i was sharing what she said. i left and went back to the laundry while they did promos. I was so sad i started bawling my eyes out and writing my resignation letter. when she came back i said to wanted to talk to her and gave my notice.\n\nin our exit talk she called me names, said i was a gold digger that wanted to find a guy to support me and that I'm unprofessional. i said than you got my pay and left that day.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR my old boss gave me workplace trauma, said i wanted to sleep with her husband, yelled at me Infront of my colleagues and an entire mall floor worth of people, called me a whore and a gold digger.",

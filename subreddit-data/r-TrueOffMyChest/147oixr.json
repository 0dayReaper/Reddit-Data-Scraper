    "postText": "Years ago I got a degree as a teacher (literature, grammar and history.)\nI wasn't able to get a job as a teacher at all: I applied and nobody answered me at all. Last time (in this year earlier)a school literally ghosted me after a phone call.\nBecause I needed money, I had to do other jobs like telesales, customer care, and other administrative tasks. However I tried I wasn't able to get higher positions with higher salary at all, but I felt everywhere even now: that our bosses eviscerate us: more and more tasks but no rising our salary, they even try to cut our benefits. I feel myself in a Vicious Circle: applying another job, mastering the tasks, but I don't feel myself appreciated, just eviscerated and trampled on.\nNow I believe: I chose wrong about being a teacher, I should have attented to another course.\nI am experienced but it's enough for nothing. I don't know what should I learn, what should I do with my life, how should I upgrade my career.\nI have no confidence at all for now.",

You can flex your teaching degree to parents to make it more appealing and you wouldn't be beholden to any bosses or gatekeepers. Just need to get some initial clients and do a good job and word of mouth will spread.",

    "postText": "When I was 25, I was a tattoo artist working with my best friends. One of them came in and we went bowling after work, and I got drunk. I told him about the woman in our friends wedding was super hot and his girlfriend called her and asked her to come to the bowling alley. She was heavily tattooed and we hit it off instantly, even though she was light years out of my league.\n\nSo, my friend and his girlfriend bail and she needed a ride home. Naturally I obliged and things went as expected. I hadn't spoke to her since, mostly out of fear she didn't want anything more than a drunken hook up. ~~A week later~~ Some time later I get a phone call to come hang out, and everything is chill. She lived with mutual friends so we just played games and drank, but she wouldn't. Weird, but maybe she's just not a drinker. At the end of the night I go to leave and she walks out to my car and tells me she's pregnant, catholic, and that we need to figure out what to do.\n\nI said nothing. I got in my car and left, and packed my bags for Mexico.\n\nIt's been 9 years.\n\nOur daughter is 8, her birthday is in 2 weeks.\n\nHer sister is 2.\n\nAnd their beautiful, intelligent, and clearly insane mother married me against all the protest from her family and I've been the happiest I've ever been in my entire life.\n\nEdit: Both kiddos are mine. First one proven, second one is mine as well.\n\nEdit2: Clarity - I never went to Mexico. Just packed. Clarity Part 2: We were at the bowling alley right after work, got drunk, she showed up, I had quit drinking knowing she was coming and didn't want to be sloppy. We bowled for 6 hours. Then I took her home. Was I drunk? No. Was it a smart move? No. Clarity Part 3: Catholic is in reference to her being against abortion.\n\nMost importantly: We're happy. Honestly, only 1 rude DM and 1 report about my safety so all in all pretty good. Thanks for the support and well wishes, and also thanks for the laughs. And the hate, I love that, been on reddit 10 years the skin ain't so thin guys.",

I think it was a couple days, but the reality was I was not in anyway ready to be a father and was terrified. I ended up deciding it was important enough to try and I'm glad I did just that :)\n\nI think the best part is calling my dad a week or so after all of this happened and saying \"Hey dad, you're going to be a grandpa.\" and his response, verbatim, was \"You can tell your mother.\" and he hung up on me, lol.",

We're not rich, never will be, but we're comfortable and our kids don't go without.\n\nI hope when one of my daughters calls and tells me they're pregnant (if that's how this story goes, that is) that I can handle it a bit better, lol.\n\nTo be fair though, neither of them even knew her name, and had never met her at this point. My dad met her at the tattoo parlor almost a month later, for the first time haha",

The sentence basically means their brother is making 6 figures and is married to the mother of his child. I think \u2019that person\u2019 was supposed to refer to the brother now wife/ then gf. But poster omitted her from the first sentence so it becomes like \u2018that person\u2019 refers to the brother or grandkid lol.",

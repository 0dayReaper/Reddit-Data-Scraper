    "postText": "I (27F) had a fallout with a friend (29F) a yeah ago next month because i quit a job she helped me get. (I was unprofessional about it and am FULLY aware that wasn\u2019t ok to do, also understand the anger my ex-friend had/has. also me quitting DID NOT hurt her position at all.) \n\nSince then she hasn\u2019t spoken to me, which i get, but i don\u2019t think this is something to just completely ruin the friendship of multiple decades, (but clearly not my decision i guess and that\u2019s ok.)\n\nI\u2019ve just reflected our times together and to be honest it seemed like we\u2019ve grown apart, our friendship was great as kids but adulthood just wasn\u2019t it. we did a lot of things as kids but as we grew older we grew apart. we don\u2019t have any of the same interests, 7/10 she\u2019d ghost me or stand me up and that\u2019s just frustrating itself. We\u2019d have talks about doing things but it NEVER happened. she is also someone who can\u2019t go a minute without smoking weed and that (in my opinion) is just pathetic. \n\nidk i\u2019m glad we\u2019re not friends anymore despite how it happened but looking back it wasn\u2019t fun being around her\u2026",

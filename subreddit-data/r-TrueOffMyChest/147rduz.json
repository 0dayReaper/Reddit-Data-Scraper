Now...\n\nI've lost 55 lb, and on track to lose more.\n\nI'm drawing again after years of never even touching a pencil.\n\nI'm not addicted to gaming anymore. \n\nI'm not addicted to food anymore. \n\nI'm recovering from my binge-eating disorder. I still have relapses, but not enough to deter my progress.\n\nI can walk longer distances, and up steep inclines more easily.\n\nI've shrunk out of my \"plus-sized\" clothes.\n\nI'm far more agreeable, and get along much better with my family. \n\nI look at all these victories, big and small, and I'm like \"Wow...I never thought any of these would actually happen, but they did.\" I'm more hopeful about my life than I've been in a decade, and I'm so thankful for everyone IRL who got me this far.\n\nI never thought my life could actually get like this again, but here I am. Just had to let it out.",

I was a special-needs kid, so I was an easy target for kid bullies, and some teachers were impatient to the point of being bullies, too. I was yelled at, scolded, and punished for things I either didn't understand, or weren't my fault, like not understanding social cues, or saying \"shut up\" to a bully. It really drilled in the feeling of \"you should be more like normal people.\" It happened long enough that I developed an inferiority complex that I still struggle with sometimes. \"You're still awkward and mentally behind, so try not to mess anything up.\"\n\nWow, talk about a True off My Chest within a True Off My Chest (\"Chest-inception?\") lol",

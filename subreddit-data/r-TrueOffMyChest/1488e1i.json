It\u2019s one of those things in life that makes you stop in your tracks and take stock of what\u2019s important. Always check up on friends and family and make sure everyone is doing ok. Don\u2019t feel guilty because you didn\u2019t know or they didn\u2019t confide in you. It\u2019s not your burden to bury.",

They were smiling a day before. \nI hope I'll do it too someday soon and I'm not miserable I just think I don't want to continue playing this game anymore.\n\nRIP your work friend",

    "postText": "No advice needed. I've only had a couple of relationships in my life and they have been pretty short. It's been a while since my last relationship and I've mostly liked being single and independent. Occassionally, I do get sad, but I also can't bring myself to put in that much effort to find someone. I've gone on countless first dates. I'm in my late 20's and while a lot of people tell me I'm still young, these same people, and more, will also constantly question if I've met someone or how dating is going. Some are trying to set me up more and more often with quite literally the only other single person they know.  I've been on practically all the dating apps for a while and haven't met anyone I really click with. Physically, I'd say I'm a 6 on an average day, but there are plenty of other better looking people in my area. Everyone I know: my family, my friends, my coworkers, is in a relationship. I'm always the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th wheel and feel so behind in life. At this point, whatever the next relationship I find myself in (if I ever do) is, I will try to keep them around as long as possible, no matter how I really feel. Obviously, they could leave me at any point, but no matter the compatibility or attraction I feel, I will stick with them. While many people warn against settling and hype up their loved ones by saying they don't have to settle because they are \"amazing\", my love for the single life is waning and with my track record, the next one could very well be my last real chance.",

I feel like this kinda thing would change the dynamic of my relationship with a person if I figured it out a couple months into dating.",

So I married the next guy I met. And 24 years later I rarely even get off the couch. I'm depressed, I'm a drug addict, and when I think about the rest of my life my only hope is that I die at 61 like my mom. My dad is 83 and considering spending another 30+ years like this makes me want to kill myself.",

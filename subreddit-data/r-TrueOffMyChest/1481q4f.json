    "postText": "As the title says, I(21m) dont have a future, I can see so many people on their way to doing what the want, including my girlfriend(20f) who is currently working her way towards cabin crew and im really happy for her\n\nAs for me? I dont know what I want to do, the 2 things I've thought about doing in my past fell through and didn't work out and im not sure they ever will, I've been looking for a job for 2 years, 2 YEARS, im sick of it \n\nWhen I look into the future I can see everyone happy, but when I look at my own future I see nothing, there's nothing there for me, I hate it and I dont want to admit it but I have no future",

This is your life and as much as the universe doesn't rotate around you, when it comes to your mentality it actually has to.\n\nYou're the key piece of your clockwork, if you don't move the rest never will.",

You\u2019re young, in ten years you\u2019ll laugh at what you thought life was supposed to be at 20. Keep your head up, and keep pushing. You don\u2019t need to look at the future yet, you need to worry about today. When you wake up tomorrow, worry about that today. Work towards the future, but never get so caught up that you lose sight of today.",

I took a lower paying job to start in an industry that was was aging out. 11 years later I am doing better than a lot of friends who went to college and work in their field of study. I worked hard but also found luck in the fact that most people in my industry are on the way out and companies are looking for the next generation. Just being competent and able to retain information while being able communicate that information is what got me from 9/hr to over $100k in 11 years. You may have to start at the bottom but there are opportunities out there. I don\u2019t love my job but I love my city and the job is how I support the things I do love. I was selling frito chili pies at a concession stand before I took this job.",

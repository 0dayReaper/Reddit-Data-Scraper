    "postText": "I don't know why \"being logical\" is so praised in society. It's useless. I could make a logical argument that we have fucked up the planet beyond repair and humanity is a cancer and existing means suffering for most of us and therefore the most ethical thing any person can do right now is grab a weapon, kill everyone around them and then themselves. That's logical. Is it a good argument? No. It's stupid. It doesn't help. It's not gonna happen and people won't do it. What's the point? \n\nI wish I could just believe in things the way people believe in God. I wish I could appreciate an art piece without knowing exactly why I like it. I keep second guessing everything I do and overthinking all the time. Even right now I don't know how to put what I'm feeling into words and I know if someone else read it they wouldn't understand what I'm trying to say. That's because I'm bad at expressing things. I wish I had an intuition. I wish I knew things instinctively and I wish I could trust my instincts. I wish I weren't always so skeptical of everything. I wish I could trust the things I feel. I wish I could feel certain that something is true. I wish I could appreciate life more than I already do. I wish I could get excited for things. I wish I were passionate. I wish I could feel sad when people die. I wish I felt like a real person with real feelings. I wish I could love people. I wish I cared about things. \n\nAt least I keep this shit to myself and don't annoy others with it. I'm actually really good at acting like a regular human being and being kind to others and listening to people even when they're annoying me and not letting my distaste show because I know it's my fault not theirs. I work really hard to make people feel comfortable around me. I don't complain. I'm so good at this. I'm so non annoying. I don't even want anyone to comfort me or hear me talk. I just needed to yell somewhere. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR; i'm a redditbrained rationalist. i wish i could be smart instead. the whole thing makes me a bit sad.",

            "comment": "Human beings are not rational. We can attempt to apply logic/reason to our lives and behaviors as an axiom, but at our base we are animals, imo. \n\nSomething to consider: sometimes we are actually happier and healthier when we think less.\n\nA lot of what you\u2019ve written suggests overthinking/anxiety/depression in your mental health, which is completely valid considering the state of the world. There is a ton of bullshit going down. Reading your middle paragraph I see \u201cI wish\u201d over and over. You want something to believe in, but more importantly it looks from what you say that you want to believe in yourself. You also seem to want connection. A lot of people have felt this way and found ways to improve how they feel. I know I have. I\u2019ve felt a lot of what you\u2019re saying. You can definitely believe in yourself, it just takes time and small steps that slowly become your proof. Failure is an illusion, every step you take, even mistakes, teaches you something.\n\nYou might consider making some space/breathing room in your life for trying to not think. Practice getting in your body more by maybe taking long walks and focusing on your breath, stance, muscles, skeleton. Try a martial art or join a kickball/dodgeball team at work? Dance even?\n\nAlso, you haven\u2019t shared much of your story, and don\u2019t need to, but the way you\u2019re mentioning your feelings seems to indicate that you might be in a sort of survival mode, recovering from stress or trauma. Feeling dispassionate/disassociated is definitely part of being in survival mode! You gotta do it to get by. And with the way things are in the world, it may take time and work to leave that mode. \n\nTry to give yourself some grace. Perfect doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s alright to just be. Even if you\u2019re a mess, be a mess, and getting space from all these harsh thoughts against yourself may eventually help you process and allow you to feel yourself and your intuition again.\n\nAlso, you may have already seen it, but I highly recommend the film Stalker by Andrei Tarkovsky. It deals with a lot of themes you\u2019re talking about.",

                            "comment": "I will say, I just read something about how telling people to \u201cstop overthinking\u201d can be ableist, and that was absolutely in no way my intention, but if it came off that way I\u2019m sorry.\n\nI am totally glad you enjoyed the film! To me, its so much a metaphor for art/the artist/the concept of inspiration/muse. As well as demonstrating how reality can be bleak and when we find ways to enter \u201cthe zone\u201d, however it manifests for each of us, its about taking something from the experience and bringing it back within us. The shaman initiate enters the dreamtime in a rite of passage, emerges, then begins to help others in the tribe do the same fostering their own journeys.\n\nOr, as an artist your art manifests as you, the stalker, leading others into the zone through your work, and when they reach the room at the end, it\u2019s their chance to connect with you on your version of the journey. They then get to ask the question of how they can fulfill their own desires through similar journeys. If they choose not to take it, or don\u2019t get it, that\u2019s not your fault. And the beauty of the message overall to me is that no matter how many people you take to the zone, no matter how many fail to get it, its not a failure. It may test your faith, you may question if you\u2019re completely alone and feel it may be fruitless. \n\nYou can still go back, and take and find your own truth or meaning from it. And you can try to be that truth and meaning every time you return.",

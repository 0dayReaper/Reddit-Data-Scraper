    "postText": "I\u2019ll preface this with the fact that my mom isn\u2019t a great person. For as long as I\u2019ve been able to retain a memory, most of her behavior has not been good. Some things are easy to let go. However, what she\u2019s doing now isn\u2019t.\n\nMy mom works in an elderly care facility as a nurse. She is constantly on FaceTime or will answer a FaceTime from my sibling (18F) or me (19NB) if we call her, and it definitely breaches some confidentiality of the patients there with the things that could be seen or overheard. Secondly, she openly admits to me and her coworkers that she punches them out when they leave early or if they leave before their shift actually ends. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s something serious enough to report or how to go about it. \n\nOverall, I don\u2019t even enjoy the fact that she works there because of her past. She has lost her previous jobs nursing, the worst reason she lost a nursing job being cause she \u201cforgot to sign out on time\u201d, but my other family members say it\u2019s because due to her negligence she caused a baby to pass away. This was in the NICU. Since then, she\u2019s never held a steady job or worked with anyone but elderly patients. The place she works at has terrible ratings and reviews. She\u2019s just an awful person and i don\u2019t trust her to care for other living g brings because she couldn\u2019t take care of me properly. She lost custody of me. She\u2019s been caught stealing pain killers from my grandmother who was going through chemotherapy at the time. She\u2019s abused drugs but thinks it\u2019s fine because she obtained them legally. There\u2019s so much more I could say about her, but I fear if I give too many details away that it would be recognizable to her.",

    "postText": "My boyfriend recently revealed to me that he wasn\u2019t sure of us in the beginning of the relationship. I don\u2019t even know how to feel. Before we started dating, we both told each other we were just going with the flow of it and to get to know each other first.\n\n2 weeks later we made it official in February 2022. Around June 2022 I found out he was still liking women\u2019s pictures and I confronted him about it, he said it was an accident and he didn\u2019t mean to. I was dumb and forgave him.\n\nThen I caught him watching porn, we had agreed previously that this was a no for our relationship, this boundary was already set and he crossed it, multiple times.\n\nI got pregnant around October 2022 and I would still catch him doing it, he didn\u2019t stop till late April of this year when I finally had enough and was about to leave but he promised to change.\n\nHe\u2019s changed but I am still going through the pain, when we\u2019ve talked about it he\u2019s told me to move on and let it go. I then asked why he would do that and he said \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure I wanted anything serious at the time\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know why he would even make it official knowing he was unsure, I would\u2019ve been fine waiting those months trying to get to know each other but instead he rushed it with me, now I look like a fool and stupid especially since I had his kid.",

I mean you guys dated for four months and he was already crossing boundaries that you both had set? And he did it multiple times? Then you decide that you want to have a child with him after 8 months of dating him? I feel like most people don\u2019t know where a relationship will go. But clearly this man has disrespected you more than enough times so you should think more clearly about what you want your future to be.",

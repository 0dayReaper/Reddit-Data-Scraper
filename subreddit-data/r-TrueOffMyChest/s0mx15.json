    "postText": "I\u2019ve been working with this woman who just recently immigrated from Brazil and she is quite literally the most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever seen. We\u2019ve been friendly but there\u2019s always been a level of attraction present that I\u2019m just realizing was sexual. I wanted her and she wanted me and neither of us knew it could understand that that\u2019s what it was.\n\nWell she may have I didn\u2019t. Every Friday my office goes out for beers and she tagged along for the first time. She stuck next to me the entire night and I just couldn\u2019t help but notice how amazing she looks. I have never been sexually attracted to a woman before like I am her.\n\nWe stayed late and both had a few more drinks than we should\u2019ve. We talked and finally she asked me if I would come home and spend the night with her. Then I finally understood why I had been so interested in her.\n\nI have a wife at home. I have 2 daughters. I have a family and responsibilities to all of them and I\u2019m here chopping it up with a woman who might be a fun sexy escape but is nothing compared to the mother of my children and life partner.\n\nI had been letting this friendship grow. Letting this pure animalistic lust grow in the both of us. I entertained the idea, \u201cmaybe if we just do it once\u201d, \u201cno one has to know\u201d and more.\n\nIn that moment I told her she was very nice, but I have a partner who I can\u2019t betray. I called an Uber and went home and slept it off.",

My ex and I would alternate working from home on Fridays.\n\nIncidentally she was from Brazil and was one of the most beautiful women that I've ever met.  Christiana always looked great: tight jeans, beautiful hair and full makeup. She was always very friendly and we had a great rapport. \n\nOn one of the Fridays when it was my turn to work from home my ex was also there.  Christiana showed up as always, cleaned the house and left.  I did notice that she was kind of quiet but didn't think too much of it.  Later that day my ex asked me if she noticed anything different about Christiana.  I mentioned that she seemed a lot less talkative but other than that no.  She then said \"Really?  Whenever Christiana is here she shows up in sweats, no makeup and her hair pulled back.\"  So it turns out that she was only dressing up on the days that I was supposed to be the only one at home.  Needless to say my ex stopped having her clean the house.  I thought that it was because she was jealous, which was partially true.  My ex came out as a lesbian a few years later and I am now convinced that she was jealous of me and not Christiana.",

Not this wishy washy legal technicality crap. \"Technically I didn't do shit\" yeah and technically you didn't betray the trust of not just your wife but your children as well.\n\nThe minute you realized you found that coworker attractive, you shouldn't have been anywhere near her at work and certainly not in a bar.",

The reality is, both you and your wife are going to come across people you find attractive outside of eachother, so in order to protect the integrity of your marriage, you don\u2019t go hanging with those people outside of required work functions. Yess its great you didn\u2019t let it go further, but it shouldn\u2019t have gone as far as it already did. Learn from this, and don\u2019t go hanging out with people who tempt and your attracted to because I bet you if your wife knew you were hanging out with a women you deemed to be the most sexually attractive women ever, you would break her heart. In my eyes, you still cheated. Maybe not in your eyes, but maybe in your wifes eyes too. Emotionally cheating and hanging out almost like a date like situation like this is considered cheating for many.",

While I have never been shy I really went high for this fine young lady.\n\nWe were getting a bit hot so we headed to the bar to grab some adult beverages. She said, \"I need to be honest. I want to get out of here with you but I'm married.\" In that moment I feel a sickness start to come over me. She says they are separated but he still wants to make it work. I thought I was going to be sick right and there. My ex had recently slept with my best friend while still keeping me close like we could work things out.

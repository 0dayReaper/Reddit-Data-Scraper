    "postText": "For a year, we've lived in our great new (new to us) apartment. It was more than we could properly afford, but I loved it so much. Our upstairs neighbor was awesome too. We talked all the time, she came to our kid's birthday party, and even gave them a special goodie bag for Halloween. I thought everything was great. Shortly after this, she started complaining more and more about the noise our toddler had made. I thought the amount of noise was normal - we always tried to whisper when she was home, but it's really hard to enforce that with a 2 year old. \n\nI guess she complained about us a lot more than we thought because the landlord called about how they were not unhappy about having to do renovations to reduce the noise between the units. \n\nI had hoped that because she had asked for these renovations, that she had plans to stay. Because at this point, it was icy between us, she was loud all night every night, so I was incredibly sleep deprived. But still, she wasn't a smoker. I didn't have to worry about my child sleeping in their own room, which was such a blessing compared to the last apartment. \n\nUnfortunately, our wonderful, loud, neighbor moved out at the end of the last month. We were hopeful that the landlord would pick a good next tenant since they knew how strongly we felt about the duplex being non-smoking. It's in the contracts for both units that smoking is not allowed on the property at all. \n\nOn the first of this month, a new woman moved in. I was kind of horrified when I first saw her because she definitely looked like a smoker. But maybe she just looked like that? Maybe it would be okay. \n\nIt's not okay. She's smoking in the house. Our child's room is no longer safe. Our landlord won't believe me. According to him, she was the only good candidate. I've seen her smoke in her mom's car, but she claims not to be a smoker at all. She's absolutely disgusting. \n\nI'm beyond pissed off that I can't even stay at home. My child and I have been staying with friends for the last week now. I miss my husband. He's staying home since one of his coworkers picks him up from our home, and my friend lives on the other side of the city. \n\nI'm sick and tired of these smokers driving us from our home. I'm going nuts. I feel panic every time I see her, or hear her coming into the laundry room. Oh yeah, we pay the hydro bill for the laundry in the building. So now, not only do I have to clean the machine after she uses it (because she's so gross), I have to pay for it??? \n\nSeriously, fuck you Alysha.  You're the worst kind of person.",

    "postText": "\n\n\nI didn\u2019t want kids. When I was a little girl and growing up there was never a time where I played house or with baby dolls. When I thought about my future, kids were not in the equation. I\u2019ve lost a few good men due to me not wanting kids. Once I hit my 20\u2019s I swear I heard \u201cwhen are you going to hang up your party hat and become a mom?\u201d and \u201cOh you just don\u2019t want kids now, but don\u2019t worry you will\u201d a million times. Maybe it\u2019s because I had to become independent at a young age? \n\n\nNothing in life is free. No one is going to take care of you. If someone does give you something they can take it right back. You can\u2019t rely on others. This was and still is my mindset. My biggest fear has always been me not being able to provide for myself. I started working at 14 and never stopped. I was able to purchase a nice car and quality furniture. I\u2019m a huge foodie and love to cook. Grocery shopping was fun. \n\n\nMy sister on the other hand is a heroin junkie who can\u2019t afford to be one as well as a mother. A few months ago her daughter Lex showed up at my doorstep in the middle of the night. My sister was arrested on drug charges and child neglect. I immediately gave up my room so Lex could have privacy and feel safe. My ex and I lived together at the time but that ended. I\u2019ve been sleeping on the couch. Expenses have only gotten higher while my income decreased. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne kid is expensive. My fridge and pantry is basically bare. I have custody of Lex but every time I try to get help I\u2019m turned down. Everything from trying to get her school to deal with bullies who took advantage of her to getting help with food/bills it\u2019s always \u201cYou need her mom to be here or be the one filling this out\u201d. Sure I could spend hours looking to find her mom but I can\u2019t drag her in. \n\n\nHer mom doesn\u2019t care. A few days ago I contacted my sister and poured my heart out to her telling her I need help. My sister's response was \u201cYou wanted to play mom so she is your problem now\u201d. The fucking audacity! \n\n\nReunification was the goal. My sister is never going to stop doing drugs. I used to tell myself she just needed some space and to lose everything to get the wake up call she needed. Except her everything isn't Lex, it's heroin.\n\n\n\n\nI had a mental breakdown last week. There was an incident at my serving job where a 10 year old shit head crawled under my stall door as I was half nude and it brought back memories of my SA. I relied on my daily tips to survive. \n\n\nIt\u2019s been 100 degrees and I can\u2019t afford an air conditioner. I just snapped and shaved all my hair off because I couldn't take the sticky sweaty feeling. I love Lex. She didn\u2019t choose to be born, I get it. I\u2019m not going to stop doing my best for her but I\u2019m fucking tired. I\u2019m starving and hot and I feel like a child throwing a tantrum and no one is listening.  I\u2019m slowly losing it and no one cares. \n\n\nNo one is going to help. All I hear is \u201caw hang in there things will get better you are a great person for taking her in\u201d. I have horrible anxiety over not being able to provide for myself let alone her.",

All those people DO want to help. \n\nI also had to get guardianship of my nibling. My sibling through a fit.

Then she gave her niece the bedroom and started sleeping on the couch. The boyfriend became an ex shortly afterwards when she caught him stealing her cash.\n\n&gt;If OP has legal custody, they qualify for a lot of help.\n\nBased on her posting history, she doesn't have legal custody or guardianship. I'm hoping she will follow the advice she's been given to pursue it, but it does take time (and custody in particular involves legal fees she might not currently have).\n\nJust based on my own personal experience with family members and friends from the working class, her story doesn't sound sketchy at all. She definitely isn't as financially astute as she could be, but up until she took in her niece, she was doing a lot better than many of her peers. One of her biggest financial problems appears to be keeping her low-life family members and friends from stealing from her.",

I wish I could offer you help, or money, or something to make life easier for you. \n\nI know you're worried about yourself and Lex having enough money. I'm sure you're completely exhausted. You deserve a break and, unfortunately, I can't tell you when that will come. \n\nThe only thing I can offer is this: Lex loves you, and will love you forever, for what you have sacrificed for her. She will look back and feel nothing but love and gratitude for how much Aunt OP sacrificed for her, even when she didn't have to. You didn't have to take her in. She could have gone into the nightmare that is the foster system. You didn't let that happen. She has a nice, warm bed, food, love and affection, and she's away from a goddamn junkie who gave up on her to chase her next fix. Lex will never forget what you have done for her. \n\nPlease find a way to take care of yourself too, even if it's just the occasional bubble bath or glass of wine or something. You've taken on a massive burden, and people are right to compliment you for doing so, but you also need to find a few minutes of peace for yourself. You've proven that you can provide for yourself and her thus far. I'm sure it feel like the weight of the world is on your shoulders and no one is helping you bear the weight. But you have had the weight of the world on your shoulders since you were a little girl yourself, and you've come out on top thus far. You're incredibly capable, independent, and intelligent. You come across, as my grandpa says, \"as tough as a $2 steak.\" You are still scrapping and coming out ahead. You have all the qualities of a great woman, much less a great parent. There is a solution out there for you; you just need to figure out what it is.",

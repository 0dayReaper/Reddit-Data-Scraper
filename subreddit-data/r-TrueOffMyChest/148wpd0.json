    "postText": "My (26f) bf (29m) just broke up with me. I got a bit sassy over him telling me that he was going to room with a group of women during his work trip, this was outside of the original accommodation that their office provided so they\u2019re going to pay for it themselves. I got weirded out by it and didn\u2019t respond well i just said \u201ck\u201d. i realized how passive aggressive i was being and apologized for how i acted but he got so mad at me and started sending all the links to the girls profiles (i didn\u2019t ask for it) then told me he\u2019s disgusted that he had to do that. i argued that i didn\u2019t ask for him to do it and that he\u2019s being unfair to me by trying to make me look bad when i didn\u2019t ask him to send those and didn\u2019t even stop him from rooming with women. the whole fight just kept escalating and it led to all our past issues being brought up and he ended up breaking up with him cause he\u2019s afraid that the fights will get even worse in the future. I think it\u2019s worth noting that i reacted the way i did because he has acted suspicious in the past like he hid things from me, prevented me from coming to his gigs, hid me from his friends etc, tends to be a bit flirty with other girls etc.\n\nI know he doesn\u2019t value me so i should be able to move on right? but i find myself wanting to fix things and i\u2019m beating myself up over it for not having enough respect for myself to just move on.",

    "postText": "I noticed that after working overseas a switched flipped on my brain that wanted me to separated from my family and start living on my own. But my family is always telling me. Family comes first. But I myself don't feel that way when I'm with them. To the point that I feel like I'm residing with them but not living with them. And this fucks me up a lot. I don't know what my true mental state is. All I know is im fucked up right now and no one knows about what's going on with my mind. Literally no one but myself. There are time thats it's all plain blank. there are moments that are overwhelming. there are time that I wish I'll do everything on my own. It sucks being a guy because i dont know who to talk to. Plus I think I have an issue with myself on hooking up with women just to feel the physical touch and the aftercare I always wanted. \n\nWhat if after working again overseas for the next seven months ill disappear and live by myself when i get back to my home country.",

    "postText": "I posted a few days ago about being raped months back. I don\u2019t understand the justice system. I didn\u2019t report right away so I had to do a call where I was sitting in a room with some detectives and call my rapist and get him to admit he raped me. During the call he said \u201cI\u2019m sorry for forcing you to have sex with me\u201d. Just found out today they aren\u2019t pressing charges because they don\u2019t believe they can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. I\u2019ve sacrificed my mental health time and time again to do what they asked of me and now they aren\u2019t even going forward. This is why victims don\u2019t come forward. Wish I never would have said anything. It\u2019s made my living situation unstable. It\u2019s ruined my life. I would have been better off suffering in silence.",

I\u2019m proud of you for having the strength to come forward and go through all this. Are you able to get into therapy? You need support to help you heal. It takes time but you\u2019ll get through this &lt;3 feel free to reach out to me anytime. I care.",

    "postText": "I (15f) have recently moved in full time with my mother (37f), after leaving an abusive situation with my father (40f)around October last year. I eventually found out that my mother had started dating again. I was completely fine with it I met him and my mum seems very happy with him and seems to enjoy his company. I genuinely don\u2019t have any issues with him. \n\nRecently after reconnecting with my father to pick up things from his house and soon to have picked up everything I found out that he was moving and my father said \u201cit\u2019s not any of your business where I am moving.\u201d And I feel crushed because I used to have a very close relationship with my dad growing up and he at one point wanted to move very strongly towards his family, mum and I denied and hated the idea. And so I\u2019ve been scared he is going to leave and I\u2019m going to loose all contact with him. \n\nNow here\u2019s where the title comes into play. I don\u2019t and I am not ready to have another strong father-like figure in my life at all, but my mothers boyfriend keeps on suggesting that \u201cI\u2019m here, not as a father but the same place as one\u201d and I have already expressed how I feel about this and we were about to go out for the day but all I wanted to do was curl up into a ball and cry, I felt sick. I know he means well and we had a good weekend but he keeps on trying to parent me and suggesting he is \u201cfather like\u201d and that I\u2019m his \u201csecond chance at being a parent\u201d (he has a 19 year old son) and I just feel sick. I don\u2019t know how to feel, what to do and I feel like I may be overreacting?\n\nI feel now I can\u2019t talk to anyone I truely trust about this because I feel my situation(s) to be inferior to theirs and I feel like a burden. I\u2019m so tired, I\u2019ve been over thinking a lot and I just feel hopeless. I know I can talk to my boyfriend, or a friend or even my mum, but it all feels pointless. I\u2019ve started spiralling into my depression again and I can\u2019t express how much this is weighing on me, I feel like I can\u2019t breath and my therapist only sees me once a month and I just cant anymore it\u2019s choking me. I feel like I\u2019m loosing my dad, and someone is trying to replace him. But I like the idea of \u201cfamily time\u201d and I\u2019m just so torn.\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is a long post I just needed somewhere to vent..",

            "comment": "You need time to process how much your father\u2019s words have hurt you. Your mother needs to understand that you can\u2019t switch parents like changing a pair of socks (although it\u2019s not her who appears to want to step in your father\u2019s shoes). Your therapist would indeed say you need time to process the hurt, and reflect upon what this means for you, your relationship with your father and the impact it has had. \n\nSelf care is important, but it is not selfish. You should be allowed alone time if you need it, and you should be the one to determine how much of your mother\u2019s partner plays a role in your life. You are not being dismissive, but he wants to step in and possibly substitute the hurt with an offer, and that may not be the best thing for you whilst the situation and fear of losing your father is at the forefront of your mind. \n\nToo many people listen to hear and don\u2019t listen to understand. You need someone to understand your feelings, how it\u2019s affecting you and that you need to work at your own pace to reflect on what your new life may look like. \n\nSmall steps for you, and lots of self care, but communicate to your mother that you feel a bit overwhelmed at the moment so need some space and time to heal. At your own pace, if you are able to have some small interactions with your mother\u2019s partner, it has to be on the understanding that you want to make a friend, not a replacement father. \n\nIt may be your mother\u2019s partner has good intentions, but we don\u2019t always know what the right thing to do is, so we try our best.",

And the idea of someone that\u2019s a fatherly figure terrifies me and I\u2019m definitely going to take time for myself and to heal, I don\u2019t know if I should talk to mum about a different approach with things and try to set the boundaries again?",

I haven\u2019t spoken to my dad in about 2 years and it still hurts even though we aren\u2019t in contact due to his history of abuse and alcoholism. I have a stepfather who i love and go to him for all my fatherly advice but it will never be the same, and that\u2019s ok. Your moms boyfriend definitely needs to give you some space. Have you told him that you appreciate the offer? Maybe tell him thanks but you\u2019re still adjusting and ask that he just drop it for now. There are subreddits that center on estrangement from parents.",

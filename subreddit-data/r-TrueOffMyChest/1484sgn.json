    "postText": "Today, I (20F) asked my coworker (24M) to give me a ride home today, to which he said yes. On the way to my house, he was receiving texts from his girlfriend whom I\u2019ve never met, about giving me a ride. I wasn\u2019t trying to snoop into his personal business, I really wasn\u2019t, but I noticed his notification said that she told him to not give me rides anymore and that if I asked him to do it again he should decline. \n\nI didn\u2019t look at the whole message or get the whole context of what she was saying, but I could tell based off of how long the notification was that she was angry. He kept saying it was fine and dropped me off, but after I went home I texted him and told him that if his girlfriend was uncomfortable with it, I wouldn\u2019t be asking him for rides anymore. I also mentioned that I am in a happy, healthy relationship with my boyfriend of seven months just recently. And that he could tell his girlfriend that if she didn\u2019t already know.\n\nI apologized for violating a boundary of hers and his, but I also mentioned that I was sickened and disgusted by the implication that I would do anything to try and make a pass at him or anything like it, which would not only ruin both our relationships, but also likely cost me my job. It literally made me feel nauseous and sick to my stomach when I first understood what made his girlfriend so uncomfortable.\n\nI am autistic, and was only recently diagnosed, though I am certain that I have displayed symptoms ever since elementary school. I know it will pass, and after talking to my boyfriend I know that it isn\u2019t my fault, and that there is nothing \u2018wrong\u2019 with me, but I still can\u2019t help but to feel like this is something I failed to pick up on because of my autism, and that it is my fault that I didn\u2019t realize sooner why it would be a problem. I 100% respect both my coworker and his girlfriend and their boundaries, I am just upset with myself for not \u201cgetting\u201d it sooner. Because had I not seen what I had seen in his notifications today, chances are I would\u2019ve asked him for rides again in the future (I don\u2019t ask him every single day but it has happened regularly) and continued to make his girlfriend uncomfortable.\n\nIt never occurred to me to even think about things in that way, especially since in the near three months I\u2019ve worked with him, I\u2019ve come to view my coworker as an older brother type of figure. Especially since my biological brother has been such a horror to me and my family for years, something my coworker is aware of and can relate to. \n\nThis is another reason why I feel as sick as I do, because deep down I know that if anything, the only thing more than coworkers I would consider him being is family (thought I would never tell him this.) It hurts knowing I\u2019ll have to act as impersonal and boring as possible around him now, to respect their boundaries and keep everyone comfortable, but I\u2019m willing to do whatever I have to to endure both he and his girlfriend feel safe.\n\nI\u2019m not really looking for anything in particular by posting this, just more so looking for an outlet for these feelings of guilt, hurt, and frustration that I know will pass but still need to feel. Any guidance on how I should proceed at work/what if anything I should say to him when I see him next would be MUCH appreciated.\n\nAll I know is that I\u2019m sorry and that I don\u2019t know how to not direct the frustration at myself. I can\u2019t help but to wonder if this would\u2019ve still happened if I weren\u2019t the way I am. I doubt it.",

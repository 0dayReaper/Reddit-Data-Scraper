    "postText": "I have pretty bad body dysmorphia. \n\nIt started when I was in elementary school. I was bullied for being \u201cfat\u201d a couple of times. My mom would make comments about how I eat too many sweets and it even went as far as trying to make me wear a girdle in fifth grade to my brother\u2019s wedding. \n\nFrom that point forward I saw myself as huge. I went through middle school, hitting my full height of 5\u201911 by 7th grade. I think at that point I started to thin out. People would always tell me \u201cyou\u2019re so beautiful and skinny like a model.\u201d Which I genuinely believed was just them trying to be nice. \n\nThroughout middle and highschool I would pour over pictured of myself, comparing my leg size and stomach size to other girls. It wasn\u2019t until my junior year when someone said something to me along the lines of \u201cyou\u2019re so skinny you look like you have pencils for legs\u201d that I even began to think that I maybe might not be big. \n\nI continued with body image issues, developing an eating disorder in college in college that has resolved at this point. No matter how much or little I workout or eat I feel like I see myself the same. My BMI is pretty much where it \u201cshould\u201d be but I look in the mirror and see myself as really big. I\u2019ve been trying to put on some muscle so I\u2019ve been working out and eating more, other people have made comments that I look stronger but I cant for the life of me see it. \n\nI\u2019m not scared of gaining weight, thats not what this is about. I just really wish I could look in the mirror and know what I am looking at is truly me.",

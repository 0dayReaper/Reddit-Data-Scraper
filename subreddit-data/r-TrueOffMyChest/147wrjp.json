    "postText": "I've been questioning my religion for a decade. Last year I found not exactly a religion but more like a set of beliefs that I connected with. At first I was a bit relieved, but now I'm just upset because I feel guilty for believing in God but not belonging to a religion. I also feel upset because I told one or two people about the religious confusion I went though &amp; how I'm figuring things out, and they called me an atheist/agnostic even though I believe in God. I haven't told my parents what I believe in because they will think I'm weird and I bet they will call me an atheist too. For context, I believe in God but not in Jesus. I believe that there is probably an afterlife out there, but it is not as important as our life right now. I don't believe in hell. I've learned a lot about Noahidism in the past year but I don't know if I could call myself a Noahide. This hurts a lot, especially since I can't tell my parents because my dad will laugh at me and my mom will kill me. I'm starting to wonder if I am weird or broken.",

    "postText": "Where to start.. I (F33) am married to 'Ike' (M34) and this past weekend my best friend 'Carly' and her husband 'Josh' were in town visiting. A little back story; I have known Carly for over 17 years as we grew up together. Her and Josh have been together for over 10 years, although recently married. Now Ike and I have been married for almost 3 years and live in a city that is fun to visit and frankly, I have a good amount of friends, so we host visitors fairly frequently. Ike is Eastern European and I include this information because he and his family are much more touchy-feely than myself, which may be associated with their culture. \n\nCarly, Josh, Ike and I are out to dinner after a day of drinking and festival hopping. Now, this dinner is BYOB, but heavy with carbs, which I thought would balance out the alcohol-intake, but boy was I wrong. Carly starts getting a bit loud, which is fine because we are on a patio, but I look over and my husband is touching her hair, touching her face and is giving her a hand massage to 'calm her down.' I make a comment along the lines of 'okay! I am sure she does not need a hand massage' (something along those lines), but I am starting to feel perturbed and also on medium-alert. We are then leaving the restaurant and Carly in her 'drunk-but-playful' state goes to lightly hit her husband Josh's butt with her foot. Josh grabs her foot and she topples into the restaurant's easel sign on the sidewalk, which opens up an entirely new can of WTF-worms. He picks her up, apologizes, and gives her a kiss on the cheek, but she is not having it. I understand her ego was bruised and I am not excusing the fact that she rolled into a sign, but you would have thought he kicked her and spat on her by the way she was acting; she screamed at him the entire Uber ride. Ike, who I guess wants to attempt to calm her down again (?), is massaging her leg. For a visual, I am in the backseat with Josh and Carly and Ike is in the front seat in front of Carly. I sent him a text that went like this:\n\nMe: The point isn't that you're touching anyone when they're pissed, you're massaging her and she doesn't want it and you need to fucking relax\n\nIke: In the uber? Massaging her leg playfully then stopping when I realized she was this so I cooled it \n\nMe: Correct\n\nIke: Oh yeah. All true. But she's being very unreasonable right now\n\nMe: But like chill with the hands\n\nIke: It was a joke not realizing she's this unreasonable\n\nMe: Touching isn't a joke\n\n\nWe return home, everyone is scowling at one another, so we go to bed. I see Carly and Josh briefly in the morning and they leave. Ike's birthday is this day, so I do my best to be cordial, but tbh I am pissed. He asks me what is wrong and I say that I found it very inappropriate to be touching someone, a woman and my best friend, in this way. He apologizes, I am again cordial, but will let him know how I feel at 12:01am when it is not his birthday. In the morning, the day after his birthday, I am seething. We have a conversation where I say that I am embarrassed, uncomfortable and found it incredibly inappropriate that he felt the need to attempt to calm someone down, when she a) is not his responsibility, she can take care of herself b) is not his wife! and c) does not need to be touched EVER. I use this word lightly, but he gaslighted me and said 'you were the only one who was uncomfortable' and 'who were you embarrassed to?!?!' and 'we were all there together' as if doing it front of everyone is okay.\n\nWe are talking tonight, but frankly this has shifted my entire view of him. Am I married to the creepy-touchy guy who gets weird when he drinks? I call him octopus-arms when he drinks because he is v tall and once in a while will scoop close friends into a side-hug, but it has never, ever gotten to this point or I am honestly unsure I would have married him. My therapist said I may need to set boundaries, which makes me feel gross.. I need to set boundaries for my husband to not touch other women?!",

Everyone\u2019s expectations about what is normal or ok are different. \n\nI don\u2019t know how willing your husband is to acknowledge his mistakes but he\u2019s probably feeling criticized and defensive by the way you\u2019re reacting to his attempts to calm your friend and dial down the intensity. \n\nTry looking at it objectively from his point of view\u2026 he\u2019s just trying to help calm things down. He\u2019s not trying to make his wife angry with him. Do you really think that he prioritizes the feelings of your friend over yours? \n\nI highly doubt it. Allow your feelings to cool and get yourself to a place where you guys can talk about this from a less emotional place.  Then explain how his actions made you feel. Ask him if he\u2019s willing to rethink how he approached the situation at the time and if he would be more respectful of your feelings in the future.  \n\nYou got this.  Relationships are full of ups and downs, but you can work these things out.",

He's spent 31 years believing that this behavior's okay and was trying to console someone that you care about.\n\nI can get why you're upset, it feels like a massive breach of trust to us, but I think if he were going to try and do something more than consoling your friend he wouldn't have been doing it in front of you or her husband.\n\nI think he was just showing empathy and trying to comfort someone, but I also see where you're coming from, and I'd be upset too. \n\nWhy not talk to him about it? Sure reddit can say this is bullshit behavior or oh no it's totally fine or whatever. But at the end of the day you married this man with the intention of spending the rest of your life with him. \n\nWhy talk to us about it when your life partner is right there?",

I tend to touch the hair or do the things that her boyfriend did when I am trying to console someone, but I would do it to my boyfriend, friends or even strangers, but NEVER my boyfriend's friends (even if my bf told me beforehand that he is ok with me doing that - which is not the case in this post - I would not feel comfortable doing it).",

And tell Carly to hold her liquor better.\n\nI am just saying, from a man's perspective, when out in a group, and one of the women gets exceedingly drunk; it can be really hard to support her, and keep her from falling over without your hand grazing over inappropriate areas, especially if she is \"dressed up\" in some kind of sexy outfit. What makes it worse is...since men are physically stronger...the men in the group are typically expected to minimize the situation and hold her so she doesn't fall.\n\nIt creates a very uncomfortable situation.\n\nFYI ...**What was Josh doing during all this ?** Carly is his partner ! your husband shouldn't have been the  one with the responsibility of guiding DRUNK Carly out of the venue if her partner was there.",

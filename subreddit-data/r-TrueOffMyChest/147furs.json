    "postText": "I know the title sounds self centered and narcissistic but let me explain. My mother adopted my nephew from my brother in another state (currently in the US). My brother wanted nothing to do with him, and still doesn't, so my nephew fell into my mother's lap. Well, almost 17 years later, he has so many mental issues it's hard to count. If he doesn't get what he wants, he will destroy things of my parents, the walls, anything within his range. He disrespects her every day while my father sits there and does nothing about it.  He's crashed their car and they covered for him before. I haven't been able to get my license because every time I sit in the driver's seat of our car, he has a breakdown until he can have the car. Even before I got my permit, he had a tantrum which resulted in my parents not letting me get my permit. I had to argue with them to get my state id. \n\nWell today, I asked to have my father drop me off at a friend's house for a few hours. Turns out, my nephew had to be to work earlier than expected and when I came home, he had punched a hole into my door because I made him late. He neither told my parents or me about the time he had to go to work. \nSo I try to vent to my mother about it and she says I acted just like him when I was his age. Last I checked, I stayed in school and didn't do drugs and drink and drive. She let's him get away with so much that I would have physically gotten beat for doing. \n\nShe later decides that nothing has happened at all and proceeds to say how much she wants to kill herself. I'm just so emotionally done with this all and I wish it would all go away. If you made it this far, thank you for reading it. If not, it is what it is. Hopefully it'll all be over soon. Thank you again.",

You just need the car for the driving part. How about going over while the nephew is at work?\n\nOh. He's not her favorite. She's scared of him.",

I have my driving test scheduled for this Friday and he is already absolutely pissed that I have to take our car for 15 minutes tops. He needs it conveniently at that time to go to the gym. So my mother has me rushing home to get him satiated and shut up. He complains when I have a yard sale but screams at 3 in the morning playing video games. He's one of those ones that would be loved by the \"Video games make you violent\" community.",

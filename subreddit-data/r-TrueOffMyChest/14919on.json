    "postText": "I love MONSTER 666. I drink minimum 1 monster energy drink since high school so 5 years. Thats 1825 monster energy drinks. Sure I may have skipped it maybe ~30 times. But I very often drink two a day. So a number is probably closer to 2500. I smoke one pack of Marlboro Red a day also since 5 years maybe 6. I'm 21 one will i live to see 22 i don't know but i feel i will see many more years. Which is fucked up. I know 2 people my age that have cancer and are opposites of me. They drank all alcohol but only on parties once a month. They are not getting better and they have girlfriends and are great people and I'm a worthless idiot and yet I somehow live? My cousin was so talented wrote poetry did many great things was pretty and smart and she dead. Lmao. I abuse researxh chemicals like 4cmc 3 cmc and 4cma pretty much every two days. 10 grams for a week is enough. I eat exclusively fast foods and sweets and no diabetes my blood is perfect. I do tests every month because I'm paranoid about the hiv from SEXINT agents and it's cheap if you do all the shit at once but it's not recommended.\n\n\nAnd i live and probably will live while people who should live leave this plane of existance. Which is the only plane of existance BECAUSE AFTERLIFE IS BULLSHIT. Jews are smart they figured it out the best probably. And Nietsche. On small scale it is reincarnation but in jewish sense not Buddhist Indian bullshit. In big scale it's eternal return which doesn't matter anyway. It's all a scam. Like even my post is selfish i care only about the illusion this writings will give me. That I'm better becaude i wrote it and I'm looking for sympathy or some other bullshit and it makes me a master manipulator or something? I am because I'm a fucking pervert that manipulates woman into small penis humiliation bullshit while I probably caused all this trouble by exchanging soul for big dick lmao. Final irony. Change laws of physics and get big dick but you're fucked for the eternity lol. Whatever you do you lose I guess. Thanks for reading it's cheaper than psychotherapy and I always cry after drinkikg vodka and i don't want to call my friend again i prefer reddit hahaha",

You're a human being who deserves respect and compassion. How do you cope with your feelings? Do you have anyone you can talk to or trust? \n\nYou have a lot of potential and you can make positive changes in your life. It's not fair that some people suffer more than others, but that doesn't mean you should give up on yourself or your health. You have a choice to live differently and to seek help if you need it. There are people who care about you and want you to be happy and healthy. Please don't harm yourself with substances or risky behaviors. You matter and you have a purpose in this world. I hope you find some peace and comfort soon.",

To some people (even people in the comments here) incel is just a mean insult to call losers/nerds/shut in types. \n\nWhich is kinda messed up, since, yeah there are actual incels who are ok with violent crimes against women, encourage suicide among their piers, and are just very hateful and outspoken online.\n\nOn the flip side, a lot of incels are just sad dudes who can\u2019t seem to get laid/find a significant other. So they vent about it. (Sometimes in pretty nasty ways)\n\nBut ALSO, a lot of incels (I believe) are genuinely mentally ill. And having these forums available can be seen as propagating these bad habits that aren\u2019t helping their mental state.\n\nIt\u2019s a little messed up that something this unfortunate, and kinda complex, is being flung around as a meme-ish insult. IMO.",

He was a bouncer at a bar during his off hours, worked at a shipyard regular shift.  Practiced judo for years, was clean fit and healthy, took care of himself, was objectively handsome and smart.  Should be a catch for anyone.  Except for the racism and misogyny.  \n\nEvery relationship ended with him getting dumped, every one fed his complex and led to the next one ending faster than the last until there just weren't any new ones.  So he stepped up the misogyny, got \"red-pilled,\" and just didn't have any relationships at all.  His old friend group started dropping away as well.  We all got just so, so tired of it.  \n\nI don't know where he's at now, but the last time I saw him he was ranting about \"the trans agenda\" to me, my close friend, and my close friend's wife.  I'm trans, I've known him since the early 2000s, I gave him a ride that day and a ride back home.\n\nWe've known him for twenty years, and he's just not invited to anything anymore.",

There are no innocent incels anymore than there are innocent propagandists or innocent Neo Nazis because the numbers just don't add up. Sure, health and socioeconomic circumstances may drive *some* with mental illness to embrace harmful ideology due to desperation, but come on. Hate isn't a mental illness. It's a structured belief system.",

They think that rape is okay, and that women owe men sex if they do something nice once in a while.\n\nThey have an extremely distorted view on women, and human relationships in general. They act like they don't need women at all and that the world would be just fine without them, when in reality they're just that desperate. I might be a loser but I'm never gonna be an incel.",

The post itself seemed fine, about how in the process of society becoming more sex positive, he\u2019s experienced a lot of hate for \u201cbeing a virgin and waiting for marriage,\u201d which\u2026I agreed with because me and my gf are both celibate until marriage but obviously by choice and we both are.\n\nThen you scroll down in the comments and his replies are all just weird, and he had this weird fascination with virgin women. Then someone pointed out he had posted previously about sleeping with a girl AND her mom, like dude how are you a virgin if you\u2019re posting about doing stuff like that?! Wut lol",

Maybe I went to a dating advice sub because I\u2019m having issues, and then I get advertised a post in an extremist sub that echos my frustrations with dating. Then down you go in the rabbit hole and that\u2019s how people get brainwashed into extremism. It\u2019s well documented. Banning or at least not advertising these subs to people might prevent at least a little bit of extremism. Someone has to take responsibility somewhere for the content of these subs.",

He spent a lot of his time there arguing with people on the sub and being downvoted to oblivion. It was r/IncelsInAction\n\nAnd he spent a lot of time on another sub,  r/IncelExit, that was supposed to help incels \u201cdeprogram\u201d and  stop being misogynists. I wonder if it was actually just promoting the ideology instead of helping people",

People here are generally just saying that the toxicity wouldn't end when their respective subreddits are shut down, which is also true (r/fatpeoplehate anyone?).\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to make clear that I am of course aware that deplatforming such toxicity does make a noticeable difference for the better (hence why I said that I agreed with OP), but there's always that few who can't take a hint and happen to be the loudest voices online. In short, this bullshit can't be eradicated entirely, so mitigating as much as possible is all we can do.\n\nEDIT 2: Did some of you actually think I disregarded all of OP's points because of the statement I quoted above? If so, you're a funny bunch, because I still agree with everything OP said otherwise, but accusing people as being accomplices to murders because they simply imply that there's always going to be people waiting for the next platform to spread their bullshit on (which is a fair point and why deplatforming is important to prevent this again and again) does nothing but anger a bunch of people and in turn, puts us at a stalemate as toxicity continues.",

While comments against fat people obviously still exist on reddit, it's not really the same as one central place for them.\n\nTo use that comparison if all incel and incel like subs were banned, the incels would still make their comments in other subs. But they would be downvoted and attacked for it. No safe space. \n\nAlso both for FPH and this, many would just leave reddit",

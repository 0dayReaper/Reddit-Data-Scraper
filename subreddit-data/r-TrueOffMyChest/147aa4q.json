    "postText": "Sorry this is a bit long. I needed to provide context before I could request advice. \n\n[25F]I recently got married March of this year after being with my now husband for 3 years. \n\nWe had a long distance relationship and he lived 3 hours away.\nHe would drive down to church on Sundays and would spend time after this and he would go back the same day. His drive totaled 6 hours.\n\nMy family did not treat us well at all. Specifically my parents and older sister. I have two other sisters. And my dad is also my Pastor.\n\nMy mom was disapproving mainly over the fact that I am taller than him. She didn\u2019t focus on all the work and progress he was making spiritually at all. She did say \u201cHe is going to do everything right\u201d basically to get my dad\u2019s approval. When I confronted her about how this hurt me she was not understanding and though I addressed it with both my mom and dad later in time, the scar still has not healed because of the continual maltreatment I received.\n\nMy parents also accused me of talking to a boy because I wanted attention but that really is not the type of person I am at all.\n\nI was always shamed for the lack of confidence in myself and this relationship that started over quarantine was the only thing that actually brought light to my life. I had had major struggles at college, COVID started and I was stuck at home to finish my final semester of college. I didn\u2019t have a will to live and my husband took me out of a darkness my family only dug me further into.\n\nOnce my husband was \u201cofficially\u201d in the picture though things got better for us in ways. But my family made my relationship absolute hell. I didn\u2019t want to believe they were as bad as they were though my husband had to see and deal with this truth for years alone.\n\nMy older sister (now 28) was a major antagonizer and not respectful of the relationship at all. She had NEVER talked to a boy before.\n\nSince the start of me and my husband spending time we were put on a timer in regards to the time we could spend. She would get on me for being \u201clate\u201d, she did not recognize us going out after church as \u201cdates\u201d so she would request us to run errands for her. We would do this because we just wanted to spend time. I eventually had to go to my parents because the disrespect was just too great.\nShe accused me of being a bad example for other women in the church to follow because what I was \u201cdoing\u201d was not acceptable and they would think they could do it. (Mind you one of my sisters had two boys in the church at the same time at a point, and I was the bad example).\n\nWhile a major factor to his time spent down where I lived was for church, I was a factor too and my parents and older sister shamed the time spend as \u201crecreational\u201d. I was constantly told throughout this whole time \u201csoul mating not dating\u201d and was not allowed to have a normal relationship at all. There was a lot of silent and passive disapproval. It led me to be ashamed and scared to have the relationship. I couldn\u2019t be honest about my love and my husband often felt hidden and disrespected.\n\nHe hated being around my family. And to this day prefers to not spend time with them, I\u2019ve come to respect this.\n\nMy father\u2019s approval was required for us to be married. We sat down to talk to him and tell him we would like to take steps toward preparing for marriage. \n\nThings got so bad through this process that I didn\u2019t want to get engaged or have a wedding, they had sucked any joy or love out of our love story.\n\nMy husband did end up proposing (which surprised me and I ended up appreciating it dearly), and I was forced to have a wedding that I did 98% of the work for and my husband and I fronted all of the bills that they said they\u2019d pay us back late for.\n\nPost-wedding my family has been nothing but sweet. So nice and respectful that it\u2019s scary.\n\nAll seemed fine until I found out a few days ago that the older sister in now in a relationship after starting to talk in April (very soon after my wedding) and it is approved of and anything and everything that I was shamed for and not allowed to do she is doing.\n\nI initially was supportive when I first heard but then the pain of years of mistreatment started to reappear. Because I never felt accepted or supported until I had my wedding.\n\nI treated my family with respect and got none. I was put through hell and my sister gets an amusement park pass.\n\nI always knew her journey would be quicker and easier but I didn\u2019t think it would come this soon and hurt me as much as it is.\n\nI want to talk to her and my parents at the same time (to avoid misconstrued information) and am requesting help on how to go about it.\n\n\nTL;DR\n\nI endured 3 years of extremely unfair treatment from my family in my relationship with my husband. \n\nAs soon as we got married everyone was loving, nice, and approving of us. It was very much night and day.\n\nMy older sister starts talking to a guy from church a month after my wedding, things are now serious and everyone in the household is approving of it.\n\nShe says she\u2019s in a relationship and is dating, she\u2019s allowed to care about how she looks, she is allowed to go out and spend time as wanted multiple times a week. \n\nI know they will be getting married before the end of 2024.\n\nThough I love her and was supportive of the news when it was first told to me.\n\nThe emotional abuse that my husband and I endured for years that I obviously suppressed has reared its head and I am struggling greatly.\n\nI plan on talking to my family and need some advice on how to best go about it.\n\nI want to let them know that though I love them, they hurt me greatly and never felt a need to apologize for it. Now I\u2019m seeing unfair treatment and favoritism and I know I will grow distance from them if it is not addressed.",

            "comment": "Hunny, take it from someone who left her church a while ago: they will NEVER apologize. They didnt like the fact you got together with an outsider and only are nice to you in order to make sure youll still tolerate them enough for them to have access to their grandchildren/nieces/nephews. \n\nYou can tell them how you feel, they'll gaslight you saying \"It wasnt like that at all! Youre making such a big deal of it\". And totally disregard you feelings all over again. Bet you theyll snub you at the wedding for marring an outsider. \n\nYou have a choice in how much you want to involve your family in the future. Just understand youll always be an outsider to them compared to the ones who gor marrried \"the right way\"",

    "postText": "I am the kind of person that thinks of prostitution as a job that shouldn't exist, and think of people who pay for sex as rapists, because there's no consent if money is needed for it to happen.\nBut I also have this spots of my personality that I was never able to stop from making me feel like a hypocrite, like porn addiction (which I've given up on trying to fix) and this. I discovered a site to talk to these girls and so the thing happened. I couldn't get off the bus before getting there even though this huge part of me kept telling me to run back home.\n\nI was in a flat with the girl (ten years older than me, and told me she obviously is in the job because she needs cash), we were there for about half an hour, I felt no pleasure, no shame, no fear, simply kept some kind of pokerface through all the experience. I didn't get an orgasm, nothing.\nI keep trying to dissociate (don't know if that's well-written, sorry) from the whole experience because I'm already going through depression and it would make me hate myself to a point I can't stand.\nSometimes certain smells or sights take me back there, and it's not any good. What do you think I should do?",

And that violating your principles makes you feel guilty (irrespective of whether your principles are right, I don't think that discussion should be had here). See it as a big mistake that you're not going to repeat. And know that self-loathing makes it impossible to address your problems, whatever they are exactly. If you're not getting out of this on your own, you need therapy, supportive friends/family, and spiritual guidance. Porn might be your way of coping with feelings of misery and self-loathing. If you just take away the coping mechanism but don't address the deeper issues, it's no wonder you fail. And it seems you will need help to get to those issues. Just know that you're valuable as a person and human being and that you can get out of it.",

    "postText": "I suffer from social anxiety and I\u2019ve been working to overcome it. I\u2019ve gotten a lot better, but still struggle at times. On my off days I\u2019m rather quiet and keep to myself. I avoid people and social settings as much as possible because some days I just can\u2019t take it.\n\nAt lunch with my coworkers everyone seems to engage in conversation and I just listen and eat my lunch. Every once in awhile I\u2019ll add my two cents, but for the most part I see myself as a wallflower... wishing I could be a social butterfly like everyone else.\n\nThe truth is that I\u2019m constantly battling negative thoughts such as \u201cnobody cares what you think\u201d or \u201cnobody wants to hear what you have to say\u201d ..etc.\nI struggle with low self esteem and lack confidence, but I recently learned that I\u2019ve been mistaken for being \u201ccold,\u201d \u201cunfriendly,\u201d \u201carrogant\u201d and \u201crude.\u201d A work friend of mine let it slip that our coworkers think I\u2019m a \u201cstuck-up bitch.\u201d\n\nThis really hurt to hear because it couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. They think that I think so highly of myself, and that I act like I\u2019m \u201cbetter than everyone else\u201d because I don\u2019t socialize with them much. If anything, I think I\u2019m Less than everyone else. I just wish they knew the real me. I wish I could tell them that the reason I don\u2019t engage like the rest is because I think so little of myself that I feel worthless. I feel like I don\u2019t matter. Some days I wish I could be invisible.\n\nI don\u2019t know how I gave such a bad impression, I smile and say good morning and I\u2019m always respectful of others. I know I\u2019m a nice person and I would Never be rude if I could help it. \nI feel heartbroken knowing how others see me. I feel so misunderstood. I wish I could be the warm, bubbly, talkative girl that everyone liked; but I don\u2019t know how to be her... or if I even can. \n\nI hate that I\u2019m like this. Socially anxious, insecure, scared, shy, quiet, easily intimidated, self conscious... I just wish I could be somebody else. I just wish people understood me and the way I am. ...I just really hate myself sometimes.",

            "comment": "I can relate how frustrating it can be to feel like people are misinterpreting who you are and what you stand for. I appreciate your willingness to open up about this, as it can be tough to admit when we're struggling with social anxiety and low self-esteem.\n\nIt's not uncommon for introverts or those with social anxiety to be perceived as unfriendly or aloof, even when that's not the case at all. And while it's never easy to have others think poorly of us, it's important to remember that their perception doesn't necessarily reflect who we truly are as individuals.\n\nThat said, it might be worth exploring ways you can connect more deeply with your coworkers, even if it feels uncomfortable at first. It can be as simple as asking someone about their weekend or commenting on something in the office. You don't need to become a social butterfly overnight, but taking small steps to build relationships can make a big difference over time.\n\nKeep in mind that you are worthy and deserving of love and connection, just as you are. Don't let negative thoughts keep you from living the life you want. Keep pushing through, and know that there are people out there who see and appreciate you for exactly who you are.",

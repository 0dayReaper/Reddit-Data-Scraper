    "postText": "I (F17) am a student, studying my last year in high school and I am really sleep deprived. Not from staying up late to study for end of year exams and tests but because I am scared to sleep. I have dark eye-bags hanging down to my cheeks and I have people commenting on how bad I look. I can't stop overthinking that death is around the corner for me when I sleep. There's this same scene that keeps replaying in my head, where once I wake up, I'll find myself floating away from my physical body. It is so scary and I can hear my heart beat so loud, and it's difficult for me to breathe. This has really impacted my grades too , as I don't get enough sleep. I've been sleeping during tests and classes and not able to think clearly. I am constantly distracted and always daydreaming. I need help, and I don't know what to do. \n\nBackground:\n\nWhen I was about in year 2-3 so at the age 7-8, a male adult within my nationality community passed away in his sleep. He was about 18-19 years old, and had just started working and fending for himself. His unexpected death caused grief for the community, and of course as apart of the community, my family and I paid our respects by attending memorial services at the deceased's family's house.  This goes on about a week or more. It's apart of the tradition here. During the services, as a young child, I was so curious about the cause of death and once I heard that he died while sleeping (the first time I ever heard that it was possible to die while sleeping) I was so paranoid ever since. The thought of me possibly dying while sleeping spooked me after the memorials, but after like a few weeks it stopped bothering me and I didn't think much about it. \n\nFast forward to this year, I learnt that my best friend knew the deceased person, as they were distant relatives. The thoughts came rushing back in and I was paranoid again. I could not sleep at all after that, I would stay up until 4 am, playing games and watching tiktok to distract me. I searched this matter up on Google and it's a phobia apparently. Somniphobia. \n\nI would go to therapy, but in my culture it's seen as a disgrace and that I'm a crazy person and I don't want to go through that struggle. I care so much about what people think, I know. Plus, I don't want to put my family through those judgments by the community.\n\nI would take those sleep pills to help me sleep but I'm afraid I'll overdose while sleeping. I KNOW ITS SILLY BUT IT COULD HAPPEN.....??? I just feel like I'm being difficult, but I am so desperate to get better and live life without overthinking so much.\n\n(My English isn't that good since it's not my first language. My apologies!!!)",

Given the severity of your symptoms, you should speak to a psychiatrist, even if it is looked down upon. They can determine the best course of action for you. \n\nNo matter what others think about it, you have to look after your health.",

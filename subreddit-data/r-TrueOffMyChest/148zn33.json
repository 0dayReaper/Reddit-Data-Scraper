    "postText": " About a year ago I (15m), developed bilateral chronic pain in my legs. Since then I have been seen by multiple specialists and have recently found myself seeing going to a pain clinic every six months. I have been through many tests and treatments which has also thrown my body and mind around the ringer. \n\n I am currently on a pain medication called diclofenac, use KT-tape, do at-home physical therapy exercises, and use forearm crutches as a mobility aid on my bad days. My symptoms normally include pain (obviously), fatigue, muscle spasms, numbness/tingling, etc. My doctors have not found a possible cause or diagnosis besides for EDS(ehlers danlos syndrom) but it's very difficult to diagnos and they \"don't want to put that pressure on my life.\"\n\nThough it's annoying I don't mind not getting diagnosed as long as I can be treated for my symptoms. The real issue is my mom.\n\nI see that she tries with bringing me to these appointments and getting me my crutches but she constantly denies it whenever I refer to myself as \"disabled\". She tells me in not actually disabled and it'll go away. She puts false hope into chiropractors and herbal lotions to heal me. She gets upset when it limits me and says im being dramatic and I should just exercise more as if I can walk even half a mile without feeling terrible. \n\nRecently shes started to take advantage of my accommodations and condition. Me using my crutches has gotten us past long lines and allowed us the elevator instead of the stairs when we went on a school trip. If someone is rude to us she points out that I'm \"clearly sick\" and that the person should be nicer. Though through all this she denies im actually disabled and says I'll get better.\n\nShe doesnt realize that her denial hurts. I've been trying my best to adjust and make the most of my new life. I've been seeing a therapist, per doctor recommendation, to have a safe place to talk about my highs and lows. I've almost fully accepted this but her denial doesn't help. It makes me feel like this is a bad thing and I'm unfortunate for it to happen to me. \n\nThis is very wrong by the way, sure it's difficult sometimes but being disabled is in no way a bad thing.\n\nTo wrap it all up, basically I feel stuck with her telling me I'll get better and to not get used to it.",

            "comment": "\nI'm sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you have a lot of challenges and frustrations with your condition and your mom. What is your relationship with her like? Do you have any other family members or friends who support you? It's understandable that you want her to acknowledge and respect your identity and your needs. \n\nIt seems like she is in denial or afraid of accepting the reality of your situation. Maybe she thinks that by saying you're not disabled, she is protecting you or encouraging you. But I can see how that can be invalidating and hurtful for you. You have the right to define yourself and to seek the best treatment and support for your symptoms. You're not being dramatic or lazy. You're being brave and resilient. I hope you can find some understanding and comfort from your mom or someone else in your life.",

    "postText": "My family wants me to come out even though they already know I'm gay, they've actually known for quite sometime actually - before I did. A lot of my childhood memories about discussions surrounding my sexuality and relationships is layered in accusations and words I didn't know the meaning of at the time. As early as me being 9 my vocal disinterest in dating and especially dating the opposite gender was met by frustration and vitriol by my family. Mind you, I didn't even know what \"gay\" meant, I basically considered myself straight until I was 14. I would hand-wave whatever anger and definitions they were throwing at me as the typical verbal abuse, but I didn't ever actually consider what those words meant.\n\nFlash-forward while I'm still exploring and learning definitions of words and sexualities around middle school, my mom randomly seemed to be at her limit. One random day on the way to school she just goes \"What are you? \" Again, I'm not quite there to understanding, and so she reclarifies, \"do you like boys or girls? Because you're not making it obvious and I need to know so I emotionally prepare myself if you're gay.\"\n\nI didn't have an answer, but I had learned what the words asexual and pansexual were, so I went with that, and she wasn't happy with either of those. Immediately making my day worse with comments about how \"everyone has to have sex you aren't a plant\" and \"you have to pick one or the other, being bisexual makes you a slut\".\n\nSo before I even had the capacity to understand what coming out would mean for me, I was being constantly and preemptively forced out of the non-existent closet against my will.\n\nThe degree to the homophobia in my family has always been very prevalent, but at some point I just eased myself into my reality and the identity I had come to accept about myself. I didn't make it an announcement or a big deal, I have a loving partner going on 5+ years and my cousins and friends have always supported me. And again, I must emphasize - everyone knows. They know about my partner, they know I'm gay, and even though they don't like it, they basically pretend it's not a thing. That being said, when they do decide to bring it up - it's because they want to directly call me a coward for not coming out.\n\nWhy? Because there is actually one person in my family who doesn't know. This particular person is someone my family looks to in order to choose how they're going to react to something, and they all want me to come out to him. I'm just going to called him 'The Head' incase this still in some weird way gets to my family.\n\nNow normally, I would come out to him myself. I love this person and trust him, I have an inherit understanding that if I were to do the traditional thing and \"come out\" I wouldn't suffer for it. Or at least, my heart is there enough that I really hope I wouldn't.\n\nSo why do they want me to come out to him? Because basically all their methods of disowning and abusing me doesn't work if he doesn't have context. For example, my partner came to visit me in college once - and in a bit to get me pulled out of school and force to come back home, the guardians in my family basically weaved an elaborate tale about how I was about to get trafficked, attempted to convinced my cousins that I was so angry and distraught that I was going to out all of them to The Head (because they are all also LGBT in some capacity), and threatened to put me in a hospital if it meant I didn't see them.\n\nBut none of that worked, my cousins knew I'd never do something like that, and The Head trusted my judgement of people and just told me to be careful. My family were considering outing me themselves, but they couldn't justify doing that to me. Despite what I'm describing they actually do care about being *perceived* as homophobic funnily enough. That's one part of it, but mostly they don't trust they'd get the reaction they wanted if they did out me, because the reality is they like to use The Head as a nuclear threat to scare people into submission - but he loves us and I know this.\n\nA year or two later after I'd graduated, I had made plans to visit my partner on my money. That became it's own issue for similar reasons, similar tactics of manipulation and stalking my social media came up - but at this point I was making my own money as an adult. The only control they had left was the fact I lived in the house. So that's why finally - I was kicked out of the house. (According to my cousin The Head had gotten angry that happened and made them retract it). However, leading up to that, my mom and everyone was still insisting I was a coward, and that I had to know I was doing something wrong because I \"wasn't being honest and hiding\". When the only reason anyone knew I was going on the visit was because I had told my mom wanting her to be supportive and a point of contact incase of an emergency.\n\nSo now we're here, a year and a half removed from this event, and I skimped out on details but I  always have nightmares about it. I really don't understand what makes me a unique target in this situation, my cousins - who are also LGBT and everyone knows - have expressed before that they simply do not get targeted in this way. Their family's do the same thing of just pretending it's not a thing, but they aren't being thrust forward with the weight of being the gay one who needs to come-out for everyone's sins.\n\nI don't think my family realizes how degraded and unloved this has all made me feel, which is worse because I love them all so much. I wish I was the type to experience abuse and cut everyone off, I really do - but I'm not. I love my family and would do anything for them, and to this day I am basically paying for my own place, helping with chores, and coming to events. I do all these things, but there's always this backdrop of terror and angst  because on more than on occasion they have tried to sabotage me, my future, and my relationships, especially my relationship with The Head - all over my sexuality.\n\nMy mom especially has made numerous points to just seem disgusted by me, calling me everything from broken, confused, and saying I am just not a person with real feelings in general. That all feelings I have are fake and fabricated including the feelings of love I feel. It hurts, deeply, and once again I'm in this lull with my family where they basically pretend it's not a thing. I am on the cusp of getting married, I foresee it in the next two years tops, and I still have not \"come out\". I don't want to.\n\nA lot of people have made the point to say that I should, especially because it's clear The Head loves me and that it would take even more power away from my family. But I really don't want to. It's not because I don't trust him, it's because I hate watching my family, especially my mom, basically be on standby for his take on the situation to decide whether or not its appropriate to love me. I wouldn't be happy if he accepted me and suddenly everyone cares about my love life, and I'd be absolutely miserable if he chastised me and suddenly I'm on the cusp of being completely disowned and ignored even more because of it.\n\nMore than anything, here's just a certain level of misery attached to knowing your mom is waiting for permission to love and support you. It haunts my dreams and sometimes, even when I see her for events or visit her at home, I have to hold back the sickness and upset I feel so I don't just start crying because she's made it very clear already, in no uncertain terms, she's not going to support me and she thinks I'm going to hell.\n\nSo, that's where I'm at. I basically refuse to come out, not only do I personally see no benefits, straight people don't have to do this. They get to come home with their partner and their partners get to get judged on their merits as a person, come in and out whether they're bad or good people and no one makes sexuality the center of it. I'm basically going to keep operating like that, with the caveat that the people who have gone out of their way to make sure I know I'm supported get to participate that deeply in my life and know what's going on with me.\n\nThis is my answer to it all, but it still hurts. It still hurts, and the nightmares and anxiety spells won't stop haha. If you read this far in thanks and happy pride month.",

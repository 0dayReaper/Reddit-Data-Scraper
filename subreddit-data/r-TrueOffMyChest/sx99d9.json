    "postText": "\n\nOooof, My younger sister (23) got beat up so badly by her boyfriend over some laundry and got taken to the hospital for a dislocated shoulder and broken finger. My parents are filing a report with the police and are pushing to have her (hopefully ex) boyfriend charged.\n\n\nMy husband heard and his reaction was to lean back and say she desreved it, and that she had it coming. Why? His excuse is that my sister is being babied by my parents and that she isn't fit to be in an adult relationship, moreover, he said her boyfriend had probably hit his limit with her and basically treated him as if he was the victim of abuse.\n\nI was shocked to hear him say this and quite frankly worried that he'd condone and even JUSTIFY such horrible behavior displayed by my sister's boyfriend. I couldn't sleep thinking about what he said. Especially after I asked if he would do what that guy did if he ever hit his limit with me and his response was to just stare at me.\n\nI don't know, I'm just not comfortable with his stance in this situation and I never expected him to say this.\n\n**EDIT Hey, I just returned home and checked my profile and ...wow there are just so many comments that I can not/will not be seeing but thanks for those who gave advice, I really do appreciate it!**\n\n**So, I read a comment about info being missing but that is pretty much it, Just want to mention that my sister is doing pretty well, her boyfriend is currently in custody. I haven't got the chance to talk to my parents about the police report but from what I understand my sister is still feeling hasitant about having him charged which is not a good sign**\n\n**now about my husband: So my husband and I already have exsistant issues in our marriage, it started few months ago and I admit there's some built up resentment on my part and unfortunately, I'm starting to see things I couldn't see before in his behavior in general. We haven't talked since we had that conversation and he's not even asking how my sister is. He says he's going through some stuff at work but I'm pretty sure this isn't about work**.",

His response was essentially \u201cdamn dude I had no idea you were going through that but thanks for sharing and trusting me. I think it\u2019s great that you wanted help and got it.\u201d Since telling him I have not had a single person I have told show me judgment or anything else but love and support. I think (and hope) that times are changing with stigma around mental health support, and that it is becoming more normal and accepted to seek help when and where you need it!\n\nHopefully another perspective on therapy helps you also make the decision to try it out and see if it\u2019s right for you, also remember that if the first therapist isn\u2019t right for you there are always many many more! Not all therapists work for everyone, combinations of different methodologies and different conversational tones/body language can make some people respond poorly to some therapists even when therapy is still the answer, just maybe a different therapist!",

It can become a conscious choice. \n\nAnd therapy\u2026 just having somewhere safe where you can feel heard is so, so huge. \n\nIt takes a shit ton of work but you\u2019ll get there man, and it\u2019s totally worth it.",

He's already rationalizing and justifying physical abuse of someone very close to you. He indirectly threatened you and stared at you in order to intimidate you in a way that's meant to create doubt of your own perception of what he meant. \n\nHe told you exactly what he thinks a woman deserves and has coming if she doesn't 100% conform to the arbitrary expectations of her partner. All that's left is for him to \"hit his limit\", and you have no idea what that arbitrary \"limit\" is or when you will hit it. \n\nHe will hurt you with no remorse, blame you for his actions, and see himself as the victim. He told you exactly who he is and what he is capable of doing. For your own safety, wellbeing, and sanity - please believe him!\n\nFrom this and your post history it seems that your husband has already been emotionally and/or verbally abusing you, which is often the precursor to physical abuse. You at least have a warning of what is to come, please don't ignore it.\n\nIt sounds like your parents are supportive and want their children to be in safe relationships. They can help you. Please consider formulating a safe exit out of this dangerous relationship. The longer you wait the more difficult it will be to extricate yourself. \n\nP.S. It's not about work. You're just finally beginning to see who he truly is. Don't let the sunk-cost fallacy keep you in an unhealthy and dangerous relationship. You deserve love, honesty, and safety. Good luck.

Just not doing any of that is huge flag in its own, when you add the stare, which is practically a method of psychological manipulation of \"what do you think I would do?\", I am sorry, but this is a clear sign something is very wrong with his behavior, this is not how normal human beings function.

    "postText": "Throwaway account. Scroll down for a TLDR.\n\nA little background about me, I live somewhere in Europe. (Sorry if my English is not perfect, it's not my first language) I have a very unsuccessful dating life and unfortunate series of relationships that left me a bit hopeless for a partner in life. I've been single for a long time, even if I'm in a relationship, it felt so one sided.\n\nBefore giving up on dating apps and uninstalling them, I saw this profile from a woman in Asia and she's literally perfect. We have the same interests and sense of humor. Reading her profile made me chuckle a lot and I thought she was a bot at first but seeing how well she wrote her profile with details about herself and putting what she wanted in a relationship (she wants a serious long term relationship like me), I swiped right on her. I felt it wasn't enough and I knew I'd be in a sea of men wanting her so I went for it and I regret using that free superswipe on someone so paid for another superswipe/super favourite whatever to just be in front of the line (and so she'll be notified by it). I sent an intro and felt it's lackluster, I thought I blew my chances. After a few days of waiting, she responded. She would be busy with her work so it took her days to reply. I really thought I was ghosted but she offered to move to another messaging app so we could communicate better.\n\nAfter a few months of talking and really feeling a great connection, we're in a relationship, dating each other through video calls, having Zoom dinner dates, and facetiming when we're just doing our individual things. Because of this, I asked for her address so I could send her some goodies from my country. She was surprised with the package and was so grateful about it, knowing the childhood snacks I love and such.\n\nBecause of her country being so strict about giving tourist visa, she couldn't visit me even if I offered to pay for it. I couldn't just travel to her because of my senior position at work. So we compromised and been in a long distance relationship for almost a year now.\n\nTo my surprise, I received a package at work that came from her. She said she used the address from the package I sent her. I literally didn't expect this because it's expensive for her to send something from her home country to mine. I got home and immediately messaged her about it. We had a video call while I was unboxing it and it's full of snacks and candies she loves, also a personal message from her but on top of it all, she sent me a plushie and a keychain of a character that I told her I found cute, it's Kirby.\n\nI shared with her that I had a stuffed toy Kirby as a kid that was given to me by my grandma and held onto it until she passed away. That plushie unfortunately burned with our old house during a fire incident and it devastated me.\n\nThis keychain was funny because it's Kirby with muscles (you can Google the drawing). She laughed while I was bizarrely looking at it and said it reminded her of me because I'm weight lifting. She also sprayed the small plushie of Kirby with her perfume and said \"so I could be with you even if I'm far away\". As the night sets in and our video call ended, I put the keychain on my work bag and the plushie next to me in bed as I fell asleep.\n\nI woke up with that small plushie being crushed under my neck and I instinctively apologized to it (I know, it's dumb) and placed it on my nightstand, fixed my bed and got ready for work. As I was about to get my work bag, I saw the keychain. I don't know why but it made me teary eyed that turned into a full on sob. I cried for a good hour as this wave of emotions suddenly crashed onto me out of nowhere. I never felt this cared for in a relationship with my previous girlfriends. This woman, thousand miles away from me, sent me a \"silly care package\" (her words, not mine) and included something that's very sentimental for me which is a stupid Nintendo character.\n\nGod, I love this woman so much. I told her that I would marry her and make her the happiest woman alive and she would brush it aside and laugh at it. I told her I'm serious about her and I know she was hurt from her previous relationships as well and she's just being cautious. I was late for work for that day but I didn't care. I was crying and laughing at the same time. A grown man like me that's always being avoided by people because I'm like a gentle giant cried like a baby because of this woman caring for me. I planned to surprise her on her birthday and visit her in person. I'm holding back not to propose to her as soon as I see her but I love her so much and she felt the same for me as well. I'm already holding back saying I love you to her (but she already said it to me) because I want to tell it to her in person. We're serious with each other and we feel we're each other's soulmate. I'm never gonna let her go. I love her so much.\n\nTLDR - my long distance girlfriend sent me things that's connected with my childhood and I felt loved in a relationship for the first time.\n\nI told my friends and workmates about it but they laughed and dismissed on how silly it was so I figured I'd share it here because of how to truly made me feel so good. It's hard for them to understand how this woman made me feel that I was easy to love and I couldn't wait to be with her.",

I usually get ghosted but I don't mind those now, I just feel so damn lucky that this woman who's being chased by a lot of guys wanted to be with me.",

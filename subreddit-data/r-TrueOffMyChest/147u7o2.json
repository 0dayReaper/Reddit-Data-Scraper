    "postText": "For the past 2 and a half years I have had this feeling of people watching me wherever I go and even when I'm at home. It's not the typical social anxiety feeling of stares either. For some reason I feel like famous people I watch commonly on TikTok or YouTube or sometimes even other family members are watching me all the time. I know it literally sounds insane but it's what I feel. My brain makes up conversations they have about things I'm doing and have been doing. I have a window in my room that looks into the backyard and woods. Whenever my curtain is open the feeling of them watching me comes back. I can look out the window and into the woods and not see anyone and literally tell myself that no one is there and clearly see that no one is there but my brain still says there are people out there. I don't feel like they are a threat to me either. Thinking they are out there watching me actually makes me feel safer even though I know they aren't actually there. I'm only 14 and I don't know what is wrong with me. I can't tell my parents either because they would get mad because that's the kind of people they are so I can't see a professional to talk to about this. This is the first time I am telling anyone this.",

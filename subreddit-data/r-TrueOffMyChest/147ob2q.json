    "postText": "Basically my aunt doesn't think that I (26m) should be dating someone like my new boyfriend (19m). He's disabled. He's not paralyzed but he does need a wheelchair to get around. And he's not very smart. But for the most part he can take pretty good care of himself.\n\nWe met a few months ago through a mutual friend. And we hit it off right away. He comes over to my house all the time to play video games and watch TV. Or we go out to eat. I really like him. And even though there are some things he can't do, the sex is still pretty good.\n\nBut my aunt thinks that I shouldn't be with him. Basically she doesn't seem to think that he can take care of himself and make adult decisions on his own or make decisions about sex and what it means to be gay. She thinks that I am taking advantage of the \"situation\" (meaning him). She says I am taking advantage of him because he has the mind of a child. She makes it sound like I am grooming him or something. Now she won't let me watch my little cousins anymore. It's like she thinks I am some sort of pedophile.\n\nBut I would never hurt him. Or anyone else. It doesn't bother me that he has a disability. He's nice to me and I'm nice to him. I've been abused before. My ex use to hit me. But he is so kind. I really like him.",

    "postText": "I have two sisters. I\u2019m 15 (they are 18 &amp; 23). Ever since I was younger I\u2019ve always been closer to my sister we\u2019ll call her Betty since we are three years apart (since she\u2019s  18). We have gotten along effortlessly our entire lives we tell each other literally everything and I love her. My older sister we\u2019ll call Sara was always mean to her but we kind of got along. When my family moved into my house Sara moved out but her room that she stayed in before is downstairs next to Betty\u2019s. Me and Betty became inseparable in 2020- 2022. Sara moved back in 2021 I think but Sara and Betty still didn\u2019t really get along, I got along with Sara really well and it was going good. Until they started really getting used to each others company because of me. Then they started to hang out more and more which made me happy but also I started to become their younger sister and not Betty\u2019s best friend. This year Betty had close to no school like a gap year and Sara and Betty would hang out every single day while I still had school. They started to have inside jokes, watch movies, go out to eat, and just talk to eachother every day without inviting me. Honestly this made me really hurt. They are right underneath my room and I hear them every night laughing and hanging out it makes me so jealous because I felt so insanely lonely. They are both really pretty too and it makes me feel insecure all the time. Now I never really bond with them anymore and they act like I don\u2019t exist and they treat me like I am 10 years old it hurts my feelings deeply. Today was Betty\u2019s birthday and because she had turned 18 she wanted to get a matching tattoos with her \u201clife long best friend\u201d Sara. I once had this title which I feel like I lost. They got matching tattoos today and I feel so hurt. They post about how they are each others people and I truly don\u2019t know what I did to lose them both. I feel as if Sara doesn\u2019t even enjoy my presence half as much as she does with Betty\u2019s. I am well aware that I am younger, but if Betty wanted me to get one to match with them I could have with parental consent. Betty wanted my mother to get one with them to it would be  a daughter mother matching tattoos but my mother declined because she didn\u2019t want me to be left out. Sara came up to me today and asked what I would want to get if I wanted one when I was an adult. I said i would get something on my own with my own meaning and she acted like i declined getting a tattoo with them. This made me mad because I was never asked if I wanted to get one. Betty said she wanted to match with Sara not me. I even offered for all of the sisters to get tattoos together and my idea was shot down immediately. I feel so let down and like I\u2019m not good enough. But am I wrong for feeling like this? I just feel like I lost my best friend of 15 years. I love Sara, we do get along it\u2019s just not really the same as when we are with Betty. It feels like they rub it in my face that they get along so well without me and everyday I feel so depressed because of this. What should I do?",

            "comment": "I don\u2019t actually think you did something wrong besides being younger than both of them. May sound silly but Sara is 18 and you\u2019re 15 and while that doesn\u2019t sound like a big age gap it actually can be regarding to interests and other stuff. You might think that Sara and you have the same interests, but it\u2019s normal for Sara to look up to people older than her and trying so find her place in adulthood while you\u2019re still in school. It doesn\u2019t mean you lost her, even if it seems like it. \n\nYou should definitely try to draw a line somewhere. You\u2019re all three sisters and not random friends from elementary school or something which means your connection will never comparable to normal friends and you shouldn\u2019t feel bad. It\u2019s a good thing to get along, but try to have friends besides family as well. Also, I don\u2018t think it\u2019s unusual they started to do more things together while they\u2019re both staying at home more than you do. BUT I do understand how you feel and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay to exclude you the way they\u2019re doing it so I think you should try and have a talk with Sara. Explain to her how you feel and ask her if there\u2019s something you did wrong but don\u2019t pressure her (because I feel like older siblings easily get the feeling to be annoyed by the younger ones in situations like this). \n\nTry not to interpret too much into it, I\u2018m almost 100% that it\u2019s something age-related and will sort out as soon as you get a little bit older (I know that sucks it\u2019s nothing you can influence or change at the moment, so chin up).",

    "postText": "So, I have been with my boyfriend for about 2 years. I feel torn with myself about our relationship. I love him so much but there are so many red flags. I met him online through a video game and we became close pretty fast and about 2-3 months in we started dating. (I have a tendency to attach myself pretty fast to others) So after about doing 7 months doing long distance we decided to meet. He flew over to where I live and we spent a week together. I was absolutely in love with him. When he went back we soon realized we couldn\u2019t live apart anymore so about a month later he moved to my state with me and my family. We both couldn\u2019t financially support ourselves and still can\u2019t. I am going to school. We were so happy and had so many plans. Our first problem was that i was friends with one of my exes. I had a friend group and he was in it so we would hang out and stuff. Once my bf came along we stopped hanging out but i would message him (my ex wasn\u2019t a great person but i was attached and i have problems stopping attachments) so my bf found me texting him and would get angry and give me the silent treatment a lot. I would stop and go back to texting my ex (not flirting) and my bf would keep getting mad. So I eventually stopped. Next problem was that my bf couldn\u2019t keep a job. He kept quitting every job for no reason. Just because he didn\u2019t feel like going. (He recently got fired from a job, so he is unemployed). He has awful work ethic and always says he will change but never does. I had a job but i quit to go full time to school. (Which I still am doing) He also has an awful attitude most of the time especially to my family and work. He has awful manners and is disrespectful sometimes. But i love him so much, he is funny and makes me smile and he does small things that keep me from totally losing myself. I will say I have screwed up in this relationship many times. I flirted behind his back when he was giving me the silent treatment, thinking I could get comfort from others. (It wasn\u2019t the case and i screwed up, which he knows about and stayed) i feel like we are holding onto something that is not going to last and i want to marry him but i feel like i would be giving up on my younger self. I feel like i deserve someone that can be my equal and help me and also make me smile. And i feel like he deserves better and someone that won\u2019t look to others for love and comfort. it plagues my mind so much that sometimes I can\u2019t even look at him and it hurts so much bc i do love him but i feel like we need to spend time apart but i can\u2019t do that to him.",

If I break up with him then he will have to move back and idk if I\u2019m ready for that change and also I feel bad bc I would be turning his life upside down",

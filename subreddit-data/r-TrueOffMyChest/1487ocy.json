    "postText": "My grandparents (dad's side) have been ruining my family\u2019s life for many years and I only recently got the full story from my mom so here\u2019s what\u2019s happening/happened. It started years ago in our home country when my parents got married grandma tells my parents (I was like 1 maybe less at the time) to go the USA because we will buy you a nice house ( grandparents from this side were always well off and had money still) so my mom agrees and takes me and my dad over to the USA to start a new life rather than going to Europe with her family that have been there for years already and have a restaurant that my dad could start working at. We get here and about 6 years later my grandparents also come and live with us for a bit before they find their own place. (Still no big house has been bought let alone any money given as promised) we live here for another 10 years or so but still nothing. Only empty promises as always, but recently my dad went along with grandparents back to homeland to sell the last house they have left. Surely they will give us some of that money ( at this point we are lower middle class living a decent life in the USA always thankful) but they comeback after selling the house for about 100k in usd. This was a few months ago, still no money or house price that was promised, nothing my dad is really hurt but there\u2019s nothing we can really do. But a couple weeks ago we hear that this money has been put under a cousins name that also lives in the us but nobody tells us, this cousin does well financially and do not deserve this money because we were promised it and it was my dad who went with them on the plane to our homeland, they have done absolutely nothing to deserve the money but grandparents give the cash to them rather their own son and 3 grandchildren. They deny everything even though we clearly know. So basically over years of empty promises and lies (other things than this but this is the big thing) we were ruined since if it were not for them we would be in Europe living more comfortable lives and with more family and closer. Sorry might be grammar errors but I will update this later because I am in a hurry. Just had to relieve this because I am still fuming.",

People can promise you anything but until they give it to you don't let them string you along. It is all about control. \nFeel free to cut ties with your grandparents. They haven't been there for you anyway.",

    "postText": "My now-ex-partner broke up one month ago today after I was unable to help them through one if their self-harm situations. \n\nThe night before I saw someone have a seizure at my local fast food joint; and that morning I felt so emotionally disconnected, even when they started crying and hitting their head - I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to do anything. And them running into a kitchen to grab a knife and cut themselves across their chest, I only was able to stop them when they wanted to do it again.\n\nI know living with someone with mental illness is difficult, and that it\u2019s not fair to make your partner take care of you - but I wish I had just hugged them, I wish I had just been competent enough to send emails to their professors and co-workers excusing them today without making them embarrassed (for reference, I said they were having a crisis - nothing specific).\n\nOur relationship did grow co-dependent, and we both have issues that we need to work on. But I wish I could\u2019ve been better, I wish to live the life I had for 3.5 years that I lost, and I wish I could be with my partner again.\n\nI\u2019m sorry forever.\n\nThank you for reading.",

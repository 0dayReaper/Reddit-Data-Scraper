    "postText": "I (23F) was born shortly after my parents (42 F, 42M) graduated high school. My dad was an absolute ass and cheated on my mom. He went on to have 6 more children and hasn\u2019t stayed in their lives long. My mom did amazing at raising me, never talked ill of him and encouraged me to spend time with his family. I am very close with his mother and I would see my grandma every other weekend for as long as I can remember. He would pop in every now and then playing hero/best dad ever. He\u2019d spoil me and give me gifts, take me out to do fun activities, go to family events, and do special things with him before he\u2019d go ghost again. He hardly ever paid child support and fled to another state to evade it. This all eventually added up and he was expected to continue paying back child support after I turned 18.\n\nWhen I was 14, he met and eventually married my step mom. She had two kids of her own and seemed like an awesome step mom for a while. We\u2019d all do things together for a couple years, until it all came to a head. My mom met my step dad when I was 16 and he really stepped up and helped me when he could. He taught me to drive, he took me fishing, we went to the movies often, and he really helped and stuck by my mom and I during a very dark time in our lives. They got married 6 months after they started dating and talked about having more kids together. My dad got very upset by this and would make comments whenever I came over. He even tried to tell me to convince my mom to drop claims of child support since he was in my life now and since I had a step dad to help out. He got jealous that my stepdad was teaching me different skills, despite him making no effort to do so. \n\nIn response, he, my step mom, and my step siblings started doing things without me and it broke my heart. When I told my grandma this, she chewed them out. My stepmom blocked me on Facebook \u201cso I wouldn\u2019t get jealous when they did things together.\u201d She eventually yelled at me and sent me a nasty text explaining that I\u2019m such an ungrateful child and that my father does so much for me and I take him for granted like his other children that don\u2019t want to see him. She had other choice words that crushed me. My mom called her and tore her a new one, resulting in my stepmom having a crying meltdown. My father in response slandered my mom and I on Facebook, calling out my mom\u2019s past history of alcoholism and accused her of trying to spread lies to me. I messaged him privately to tell him off and it turned into a big fight.\n\nMy grandma attempted to have a meeting where we could hash it out in private. My dad and stepmom came over for dinner, not knowing I was there. My stepmom brushed past me and didn\u2019t say a word. My dad and I had a talk on the porch and I thought we made good progress. We expressed our feelings and felt that we came to an understanding. I then set a boundary that our relationship couldn\u2019t pick up right where we left off, that I need time before I could go over to their home over the weekends and whatnot. He stood up and yelled at me, telling me off, and saying that I\u2019m a b***h, c**t, piece of s**t, mistake, and other choice words. I was crying and went after him as he tried leaving. He pushed me down on the ground and I started to pee my pants as I saw him clench a fist. My grandma and stepmom came outside yelling at him to stop. He yelled at my stepmom to get in the car and they left without another word. I was in hysterics hiding near the bushes and my grandma looked for me. She yelled at me and was asking what happened. I couldn\u2019t speak for a while until I told her what was said. She called my mom and she rushed over with my stepdad to get me. They held me and took me out to dinner. I cried throughout and couldn\u2019t eat much. I remember overhearing them talking that night and my stepdad saying that he didn\u2019t want me near my dad again without someone they trusted in the room. I didn\u2019t want to be near him again.\n\nThere were times since then that we met and talked, he pretended like nothing happened. My birthday following the incident, Christmas when I was 18, and I eventually invited him to my graduation and open house. He never showed and told me that my stepmom said that I told her I hated him so he refused to come. I saw him one other time in 2020 for my grandma\u2019s wedding. We barely talked. I almost saw him at another family event and people were telling me left and right that though he couldn\u2019t make it, he missed me and loved me very much.\n\nI hate him. He is an awful father and an awful person. His years of \u201csobriety\u201d that he\u2019s so proud of don\u2019t include all the drugs he\u2019s done in angry fits. He\u2019s cheated on or beat up every woman he\u2019s been with, including my stepmom. They were cheating on each other and she ended up taking a lot from him. He lost his business, which he put in her name so she could write low checks for him so he could evade paying child support (again.)\n\nI want to be rid of this hate, but I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t talk about this much to others as I\u2019ve already vented enough about it and I\u2019m just a broken record this point. Is it bad to say if he were to die tomorrow, I\u2019d be relieved?",

I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve gone through so much bullshit with him and your stepmom. \n\nI highly recommend therapy. I\u2019m in it and it has helped with my issues with my mom (I\u2019m no contact, also won\u2019t feel that sad when she dies).",

It\u2019s something not a lot of people can truly empathize with, they just don\u2019t understand how being cut off from a parent can really affect you. I hate trying to debate with others why \u201cbeing the bigger person\u201d and \u201creaching out to make up and have a relationship\u201d is worse for my mental health and puts me in danger. \n\nI\u2019m currently in therapy, have been for a couple years but I\u2019m finally clicking with my new therapist. Doing DBT therapy and I\u2019ve been really learning how to use radical acceptance to get through these types of issues. It\u2019s definitely a work in progress and it\u2019ll take a long time to get past with over 20 years of untreated trauma. \n\nThank you for being a kind and understanding human, I wish you luck and healing in your journey!",

The vast majority would say no, so I tell them that until they\u2019ve been in that situation, there\u2019s no way for them to understand. Which is a good thing since no kid should have shitty parents, but makes it unfathomable to them that kids would cut contact with parents. I had a cousin try to talk me into forgiving my mom and all, and I finally had to explain that was tried multiple times until I decided it wasn\u2019t worth the pain anymore. Now I just stop the conversation. I don\u2019t have the energy or time to explain the details of it all.",

    "postText": "I went on a trip to Europe and met the most amazing woman and we hit it off. Me being an ass had a gf back home who I was planning on breaking up with, but never told the woman I met  I exchanged numbers with the girl I met and continued to talk to her. I then confessed 2 days after I got back to my gf and broke up with her so I could have a chance with the other woman. My ex gf messaged the girl that I was  still with my ex while we met and now she feels betrayed I never told her about my gf even though I was going to break up with her anyway. she has stopped all communication with me. I had to move in with my grandparents while I continue work. Moral of the story is always be honest because karma will make sure you pay for your misdeeds.  I have lost my only friend (unrelated), my ex, and someone I really cared about and wanted a future with all in the span of a few days.",

    "postText": "Hi. First off I want to say that english is not my first language and also i am on mobile. I know this is my fault and I am not looking for any sympathy as I am aware. I made a mistake, procrasnitated and missed an exam and i fear i might not be able to graduate college. Once again procrasination is my fault but now, idk i've been having these thoughts about not beign here anymore, like s*icide thoughts. And i do not have anyone that would truly support me. And idk if it is really worth living anymore. Just wanted to get this off my chest.",

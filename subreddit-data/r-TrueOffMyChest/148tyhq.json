    "postText": "&amp; I feel like I\u2019m going to throw up. How could someone hold a baby kitten and see it in such pain and then just not bring it to the vet? I have anxiety and a sick sinking feeling in my stomach worrying about the kitten. The op hasn\u2019t replied, all their videos were locked and comments were disabled and this poor kitten \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I am hoping that the OP didn\u2019t reply because they changed their mind and they are going to the vet. My little baby cat babushkas are here comforting me and I just want to squeeze them so tight because I couldn\u2019t imagine being so negligent to such a cuddly creature.",

It was so horrible. They just aren\u2019t replying. I can\u2019t imagine holding a kitten like that and being on the side of the video where they can actually do something about it being like \u201cwell there\u2019s nothing open right now\u201d hitchhike \u2026 walk \u2026 drive .. take a bus \u2026 I don\u2019t care how you do it just do it \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d I feel like human maternal/paternal instincts should take over at that point. But I agree. I tend to try not to take my cats to the vet unless I feel it\u2019s urgent so I get that but like this wasn\u2019t that \u2026 this wasn\u2019t like \u201cmy cat is not eating, can my cat make it though the night?\u201d And then it\u2019s like okay \u2026 I could understand how someone could dismiss that ity bitty red flag \u2026 but this cat was paralyzed, twitching and pooping itself \u2026 that\u2019s not like \u201chmmm, do you think my cat will be okay?\u201d That\u2019s a\u2026 \u201cwill my cat be alive in 20 minutes?\u201d Type situation like holy fluff. At this point in life I know what is urgent and what is not and cats hiding and not eating is urgent\u2026 I could just understand that. I can\u2019t understand this. I\u2019m usually not the type to get bent out of shape about random videos online either but like \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d",

Try to let yourself calm down a little. We all feel helpless towards those we can\u2019t help, but we can help those who we are able to.",

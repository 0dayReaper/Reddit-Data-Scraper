    "postText": "I really just need to vent. I recently got into some drama with my ex/ex-best friend which led to me completing cutting her off from my life. I still don\u2019t second guess my decision, but I have been going back and forth everything that happened between us in my head. This is just something that I kinda forgot about that was probably the start of where everything began to go wrong with us.\r  \n\r  \nA few months ago, now (we weren\u2019t dating anymore at the time) my ex and also ex-best friend (who we\u2019ll call \u201cA\u201d) and I were texting back and forth. Around the time she was having a particularly hard time at home with her family and drama with her friends, on top of her grades which were starting to suffer because of it. \r  \n\r  \nOne night whilst we were texting, she said something along the lines of, \r  \n\r  \n\u201cI have pills in my drawer.\u201d \r  \n\r  \nAnd I was like uhm, okay? Because that had nothing to do what we were talking about. Then she said, \r  \n\r  \n\u201cthere\u2019s 14, I counted\u201d (14 is a guesstimate I don\u2019t quite remember) and I was like what are you talking about? What do you mean by that?\r  \n\r  \nBut she refused to elaborate, just saying like haha it was nothing and to forget about it. \r  \n\r  \nNow, only a day prior I had gotten word that an otherwise casual friend of mine was in the hospital due to attempted suicide (she ended up being okay but she\u2019s a whole other can of worms). We weren\u2019t that close, like I said she was kind of just someone that I knew from around. But to think that she was struggling like that and I never even knew about it was simply daunting. I was just still processing it.\r  \n\r  \nI told A, you can\u2019t just go around saying shit like that. It\u2019s not it\u2019s not funny and you can\u2019t joke like that. She was like \u201cyeah, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Then abruptly said that she had to go.\r  \n\r  \nWe didn\u2019t really talk over the next few days, until I finally reached back out to her, and I asked her what was going on with her and the pills, and if she was okay. \r  \n\r  \nA then told me that shortly after we stopped texting, that her dad yelled at her for throwing the pills away. Which she was going to use to OD. She said that after our talk, she felt really bad about what I had said. But I only said all because I thought she was just trying to be edgy and quirky, and I thought she wasn\u2019t taking it seriously. But it turns out that her cousin (of which she was really close to) who lives in a third world country had attempted suicide. And that she couldn\u2019t get ahold of him and had no idea whether or not he was even still alive. She was spiraling but she didn\u2019t talk to me directly, instead she just came across (to me) as aloof and insensitive. \r  \n\r  \nAs you can imagine I felt terrible about scolding her. I never would have if I had known. It wasn\u2019t my place, and perhaps she was simply using humor to cope. Nonetheless, no matter how bad I felt about the whole thing she said that I saved her life. That I snapped her out of it. That I got her to throw the pills away and I was like no girl !! YOU did that. It doesn\u2019t matter what I said or what impact you think that what I said had on you, you were the one who made that decision. I told her I\u2019m not a life saver! I didn\u2019t do anything! And she just kept saying \u201cbut you are.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nA couple years back, I had to report someone close to me because she was texting me back and forth talking about how much she hated her life and that she wanted to die. I was just a kid. I didn\u2019t know what to do with that so I reported her (to the SCHOOL COUNSELOR by the way). Then even after I got actual CPS called to her house she told me that I saved her life. Even the next (and the last time) I ever saw her mom, she gave me a big hug and thanked me for what I did.\r  \n\r  \nBut I\u2019m not a life-saver. I\u2019m an idiot. I just happen to be lucky that everything worked out in the end. At least for me. I reported my friend to the SCHOOL COUNSELOR not knowing that (most of the time) those bastards are the worst at caring for students\u2019 mental health. I know that now because of personal experience and not only that but her mental health quickly just declined again shortly after the fact. Then I scolded my best friend when she probably needed me the most. I didn\u2019t even ask her where she was coming from, or what was wrong. I just reprimanded her immediately. \r  \n\r  \nUncool.\n\nMaybe I am just overthinking all of this, but I'm not pleased with my actions.",

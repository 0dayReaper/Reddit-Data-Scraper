    "postText": "growing up I was always religious. I didn't go to church but I addended multiple Christian schools and youth groups where I integrated the idea of heaven and God and Jesus into my life. In Primary school I  learned from an early age about the bible and its teachings, and I always stayed true to my beliefs that one day I would be up in heaven with my other relatives and friends. However, during middle school and now into high school my perception has changed and I have grown new beliefs through my own experiences in everyday life. I no longer believe that eternal life in heaven awaits us, how could it? surely there would have to be something beyond that. My new perception of reality in now based around nothingness. \n\nBefore you ask, yes I am Atheist, and even though I have only recently accepted it, I believe I have been so for quite some time now. From early on, I don't fully know what it was, but something about worship and praise almost... pissed me off. In primary school, each morning  we would sing along to a few Christian songs. Not the old fashion sort you hear from a choir in church, but the more contemporary, \"rock and roll\" sort. I'm sure I'm not the only one who finds these Christian \"pop\" songs obnoxious. Early on I enjoyed them, however after time I slowly grew tired of the basic tunes and the boring lyrics which sound like they've been made up on the spot. I feel like this is where the turning point began. \n\nIn my final years of primary school I grew to hate Songs of praise. and it kickstarted my new opinions on religion. I think the fact that I was now becoming a man and my brain was rewiring throughout middle school became one of the biggest causes of my mindset change. I started thinking more *practically*. \n\nThis new mindset I adopted made me question the beliefs I had grown up with, and I became somewhat depressed. I felt like my whole life had been a lie and the realization that there may not be eternal life after all shocked me. most of my sadness came from the thought that I would never see my  family again after death (which looking back sounds like an awful lot to worry about at that age). I am part of a very stable family and never struggled like some people did. and I feel very sorry for those who grew up in harder times. I sometimes even feel selfish for being depressed when I had so much in life. \n\nI developed the idea that there couldn't possibly be a God out there with all of the issues in the world today. The bible tells us God has a plan for everyone, but I always struggled to understand how. could there really be an invisible man up in the sky? watching your every move? how did this invisible man even come to exist in the first place? a lot of things stated in the bible don't add up, and Christians seem to just back this up by stating how god works in unimaginable ways that we simply cannot understand as humans. a weak excuse. \n\nIn recent years, I've spent some time digging on the internet to find individuals with the same logic as me. I did find one video on YouTube by NatelsLame which explains it a bit further which I'd recommend you go check out.\n\nIn terms of beliefs, I currently think that there is no afterlife at all. I think it all goes black. and you just don't exist anymore. needless to say I do now believe that life is meaningful. with the chances of being born into this life being so slim, wasting your life away doing nothing would be disrespectful to all those who didn't even get the chance to live at all. \n\nI do not hate Christians, or any religious people, and I do not at all feel smarter than them just because I feel as if I've found my truth. And I do have many religious friends, who's beliefs I completely respect.\n\nIf you are reading this, make the most of everything in life. be grateful, and take that chance. go get that dream job, go on that holiday you've been planning, go pursue that new interest you've picked up. and if it doesn't work, just get up and move on. That's my view anyway. \n\nvideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3ee2RMQYns&amp;t=554s&amp;pp=ygURd2h5IGdvZCBpc250IHJlYWw%3D",

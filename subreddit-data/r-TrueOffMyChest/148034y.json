    "postText": "I went to a doctors appointment with my mom and if I\u2019m being honest I was selfish and lazy and didn\u2019t feel like going but I went with her anyway. \n\nWhen we went into the office the doctor said a lot of confusing stuff but summed it up to her having pancreatic cancerous mass and if she didn\u2019t get surgery she\u2019d die within a year.\n\nI remember him telling us to breath and it\u2019s they will go through options and when he left I remember seeing my mom with her head down and her fist in her lap just shaking while she cried. \n\nI tried my best to hold her and comfort her and I was devastated too. I told her that there\u2019s hope and he didn\u2019t say she was going to die but surgery is our chance and we have to fight it. \n\nThis made her calm down and it gave her hope and for a year we did fight and she got surgery, she went to chemo but in the end it did nothing because she ended up dying within exactly that one year.\n\nIt\u2019s so painful to remember and I hate thinking about this. I had just graduated high school it seemed so unfair. \n\nWhen I visited her in the hospital, she knew she wasn\u2019t going to make it and when it was time for me to leave she grabbed my hand with the last straight she had and asked if she was going to see me again. I told her yes but she died that night. \n\nEven 3 years later it still hurts.",

This hit far too close for me since my own mom got diagnosed in mid 2021. She didn't have the same options since it was already stage 4 and she had other issues, both hereditary and otherwise. She fought it as long as she could and tried chemo as long as they'd let her. The reason we started hospice wasn't even because of it, it was for wound care that the hospital couldn't take care of anymore. But it was just a slow decline from there and we lost her in November and I think it's only barely started to really sink in now. \n\nGrief's such a weird thing, the stuff that doesn't get to you and the things that do set you off. Was especially hard and different for me than the rest of my family in a way I don't think they'll ever entirely get since we lived together, so i had to watch both her decline and in general the year of fighting, good and bad, in real time. But I'll always be grateful for the time we got at least.",

But his final weeks had his ups and downs, as it took some time to find the right pain killers. One time, as I left my girlfriend's parents' house, he waved me goodbye with tears in his eyes - they occupied mine as well - as we were both convinced this'd be the last time we'd ever see one another. A devastating moment.\n\nBut then the pain killers kicked in and the next time we saw one another, he was almost his old self again! That didn't last, of course.\n\nThe last time I saw him, he was still doing quite okay. But the medication had an effect on his voice, it was higher pitched and weaker. Then it was time for me to leave, as I had to catch the train home. As I departed, my girlfriend's father was in the bathroom. I must've said something along the lines of: *Hey, I have to split, take care, okay?* And he replied, from the other end of the bathroom door: *Oh, right, take care son, we'll meet again soon.*\n\nBut everything wendt downhill rapidly from that point on and exactly a week later, he died. We didn't see each other again.\n\nThat sucked, but somehow it was sort of poetic, for lack of a better word. We said our last goodbyes, had our last bit of communication through a closed door. As if it were *signified* that this was the last time we were ever to meet.\n\nHe and I got along great and I'm grateful I got to know him in those six years. He's been gone for four years now. I miss him most when I'm with *my* parents, as they're both still alive and that's when I notice the difference the most.",

I wouldn\u2019t say the pain lessens as for me Father\u2019s Day, dads birthday and his death anniversary is difficult.\n\nOne thing I recommend is therapy, even if it\u2019s been years as it can help process your emotions. Never stop talking about your mum as you can keep her spirit alive by sharing stories about her.",

In all of these things, look deep within. Eventually, given enough searching, you'll find a glimmer of the woman you loved within them. A million shining factals of the past that propels us. As a shattered pane of glass. Broken? Perhaps. But lingering in its beauty as the fading sun casts its last rays upon the remnants of what once was.\n\nNo matter what you believe. Faithful or faithless, this is an undisputed fact. Know that the warmth you feel in your greatest moments is no less than the love she held for you. Know that it will remain with you until the very end. And, even then, that warmth will be passed to the next. An endless, ever-burning torch that others have beared throughout the centuries. One that, so long as you retain your ability to love your fellow man, shall never die. For all time.",

She had been in and out of the hospital dozens of times and it was really wearing me down as I was one of the only people still in her life to take care of her. She was combative with nurses and doctors and home-care staff (and myself).\n\nI'm leaving a lot out, but this basically ruined our relationship (what was left of it). I took care of her the whole time but I was an asshole to her and really impatient. I had a lot of other stuff going on (school, work, etc) but that doesn't really excuse it.\n\nThe last time she went to the hospital she had enough and had herself discharged. She passed away that night, alone, because I shut myself into my room once she fell asleep. Her doula walked into my room the next morning and told me she died. I didn't even want to touch her body or see them take her away. I still have panic attacks when I remember everything that happened but that's what I get for being a PoS. \n\n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, and there's only so much you can do as a caretaker and her child.",

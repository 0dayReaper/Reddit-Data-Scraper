    "postText": "So for a couple of days my fiance and his Mom got news he will be getting his own run. Now this run is a osf carrier,so basically delivering specimens to hospitals and clinics. So he currently shares a run with his mom because his mom the his boss,so estimated day he would do his own run would be next Monday to the beginning of next month. So for the couple of days my fiance has been looking into getting a car that would be good on gas. He has two trucks that needs some repairs,one not so major but both trucks are not good on gas. So he found a car that he really likes and is good on gas. But today I found out he got rejected. So now because of that,having a massive tooth pain and only going on a hour of sleep he isn't having a good day. He was hoping on trading his utv,if not that then those two trucks I mentioned. I wish he could be able to sell the utv and the trucks for what they are worth but he can't. The utv is barely heard of in our state (Illinois,we are in Ottawa IL)so not a lot of people knows about it here. With the repairs he needs to get done with the trucks,I bet nobody would want them. It would be nice and I was begging and praying to God to let him get the car,to make him happy. Like really happy. He made plans for that car and he even got the close versions of the car in two different games. He fell in love with that car and so did I. So this sucks and I know I'm not able to do anything to help but to be there for him. Right now I'd be fine with him not having the trucks and the utv,he was hoping to get that car that he would give up a truck that was his step grandfather's and a big truck that he got for big heavy duty. He was putting logic and what he really needed over his attachments of two trucks he does love but isn't good on gas mileage. I just wish things can be nice to him for once and see him really happy with something.",

            "comment": "One, think about removing your location. Bad people will use that and other posts to find you and do bad things. \n\nTwo, what kind of trucks?  They might be worth more, you think. Heck, my rusty 78 that does not run. i keep getting offers for 5k. You never know. Try auto max or the like to get an estimate on what you can sell it. They will give you an offer.\n\nThird,as a gear head.... what kind of car?\n\nGood luck. I hope it turns out well.",

    "postText": "For the past several years I have had a recurring dream/nightmare that a nuclear bomb is detonated a few miles away from me. Every time I\u2019ve had this dream, I can see the explosion and I try to jump on the ground to escape it but of course it always catches up to me. The horrible thing about it is I can feel myself dying. I feel an immense surge of powerful heat hit my back and it grows and grows until a numbness slowly takes over. Once that numbness hits its like I can feel myself falling out of my body into a deeper darkness than I\u2019ve ever experienced before. Eventually it feels like I\u2019m just floating in nothingness, but I\u2019m also aware of that and I think I must have died in real life to have experienced something so real as this, but then I always wake up. \n\nI\u2019ve died in so many ways in my dreams and most of the time I can feel it happen. Plane crashes, gun shots, and nuclear bombs are the main ones I have experienced. Every time I tell people this type of dream has happened to me they act like it\u2019s the craziest thing they\u2019ve ever heard.",

My doctor put me on a medication specifically for it since it was happening almost every night. It has made a huge difference",

With the right guidance one can accept it for what it is - outside of one's control - and thus make it into a positive. \n\nDreams are a weird thing... Some think they're prophetic, some - that they hint to stuff you repress, others think that they're nonsense and just a way for your brain to 'defragment' the memories of the day. \n\nButnif they're actually causing you discomfort and distress maybe it's a good idea to talk to someone who is a professional in the field about them? \n\nBest of luck!",

I make a little under double minimum wage but am scared to move out of my parents\u2019 house (1 bedroom apartment) because I think I would I would run out of money in a few months. I realize I have it a lot better than some people, but holy shit this depresses the hell out of me.  The world is fucked\n\nEdit: To everyone telling me to \u201cget a better job\u201d I highly doubt you have struggled financially in your life. I\u2019m not saying it is not impossible to work your way up in life, obviously that\u2019s true. But in reality that is so hard for so many people. You\u2019re clearly missing the point. There are huge flaws in American society that need fixing. I\u2019m not saying I know the solution, and I\u2019m not saying it will be a simple fix, but things need to change.",

I know they use this to insult people who work low wage jobs but if they can\u2019t support even themselves on it, how will they support their family. \n\nIf only inflation wasn\u2019t a problem. Entry level jobs maybe were never meant to \u201csupport families\u201d but the reality is that now with the job market as it exists, many people can only get entry level jobs regardless of age or family status.",

On top of I could never afford to save to buy a house if I rented alone because of how expensive rent is \ud83d\ude43",

That's the thing, all the people who got in early clamped down on development and they don't build enough to meet demand. Added to that, baby boomers that bought in metro LA, San Diego, and SF sell their city houses and move to wine country. Young families in the area can't compete with baby boomers who just made half a million on their previous houses. \n\nWine families run Napa and Sonoma counties, and they prevent development in the name of open space preserves and lock development on these areas for 30 years. They refuse to increase density in town centers. Immigrant families are 3 families to a house. Young families are leaving. School districts are having trouble filling classes. \n\nMy neighborhood is filled with boomers who kept their first houses when development was rampant, bought bigger ones in the forest/coast when building restrictions were lax, and then rent their first houses for absurd amounts. In fact, their first home purchases pay the property tax on the rental house AND the mortgage on the second. \n\nMy wife and I own our house, and in order for that to happen, we had to settle on a house that is adjacent a busy street that needs major repairs. Our electric and plumbing are 50 years out of code. The only reason we got our place was that my wife and I each had family that passed and left us money. Even then, we dumped every penny we had saved into the house. I spend most of my free time fixing things, and we need a new roof soon. \n\nEven after all that shit, I still feel lucky to live here. I drive by vineyards on my way to work. We're 30 minutes to redwood forests and an hour from the Pacific. It's no wonder these monied boomers are moving here en masse.\n\nAdded to that, all the San Francisco workers who suddenly were not required to go into the city laughed at the home prices out here and found they could buy a house out here for half of what they paid to rent a two bedroom in SF.\n\nSorry for the lengthy reply, but to answer your question as to how do people afford to live here? Most can't. They scrape by until it overwhelms and move to Idaho/Nevada/Oregon/Arizona.\n\nIs it worth it? Fuck if I know. I'm just scraping by, and the sad part is that so many people have it worse. \n\nSorry this was the reply. I just had to get it out. I feel better and I hope you are able to find sunny pastures wherever you go.\n\nBut $23 an hour? Fuck that noise.",

Combine that with the fact that most landlords on St. Croix suck, they only contact you for rent, if you contact them about a issue that needs to be fixed, like a broken screen, or the house being absolutely infested with flies when you first move in, you\u2019d be lucky to get a reply, and you\u2019re likely gonna have to deal with it yourself.\n\nSadly, it was the only place we could find for under $1000 after the house we were renting before got destroyed in hurricane Maria, which was $750 a month, but it was actually somewhat worth it, for St. Croix standards.",

What changed? worker's unions were killed off so the only organization that protected the wages of the working class disappeared.\n\nwe only have one political party that even gives lip service to worker's union and that's the democratic party. but we have people in the party who are clearly anti-union. but all OTHER PARTIES ARE ALSO ANTI-UNION. WHY ARE THERE NOT ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT PARTY THAT'S PRO-UNION? this means all other parties are just variation on conservatism that only helps families with multi-generational wealth.\n\nif you want to deal with the multi-national multi-ethnic group of inheritors depressing you wages, you need a group bigger than them to put them in their place. you at the bare minimum need a national worker's union. but the reality is that these inheritors are working at the global level. a global worker's union is actually what's needed.\n\nother things that depress us wages are immigrants from countries with social services, particularly universal healthcare, who can underbid us citizens in terms of salary. salaries in countries with universal healthcare will always be lower since workers there do not need the extra cash for healthcare. illegal immigrants obviously also lower the wages of the average us citizens. but you need  strong worker's union to call out corporations who hires these illegal immigrants.",

The economy tanks.  You lose money. \n- I'm probably applying for government assistance, charity, or other help that you need to pay for. You lose money. \n- If an employer can't find domestic labor to do the job, they're going to outsource the labor - immigrants, prison labor, ship it overseas, use contract workers with no benefits. Now, our unemployed population has grown and wages have stagnated again. You lose money. \n\nEvery single argument against paying people a living wage just ends up fueling a different argument *for*  living wage, usually with the same talking points.\n\n\nEdit: yes, I have oversimplified this issue because this is a reddit comment, not my presentation to the World Economic Forum.\n\nIn addition to raising wages, the US needs to seriously step up its game with regards to enforcement of existing labor laws, subsidized maternity and paternity leave, and universal healthcare to stop us from collectively being 1 bad infection away from crippling debt.\n\nThis isn't some hypothetical pipe dream. In addition to advocating for policies which have been successful in other countries, these are policies which have even successful in *this* country as little as a few decades ago. \n\nYes, this is a complex and nuanced issue. Yes, it doesn't work the same everywhere. However, take a look around. Wages have been falling since the 70's. Benefits have been eroded. The same work takes more and more qualifications. And it doesn't look like it's about to get better. \n\nIf you've seen the trend over the past 50 years and think it's a *good* thing, I can only assume you either 1. Are currently in a job that's in an economic bubble that hasn't burst yet, 2. You made a few good choices that let you be comfortable and now you look down on anyone who didn't have your luck, 3. You're struggling and want other people to struggle with you, or 4. You find the feeling of the invisible hand of the market around your throat to be erotic",

But raising that federal minimum alone wouldn't be enough to effectively target some of the issues that modern workers are faced with. For example, I live in one of the first cities to crank the minimum wage up to $15/hour, and while it did benefit a lot of people, it also led to a lot of people suddenly being cut to part time, or becoming contract workers; we need labor protections at multiple levels in order for any given intervention to mean anything. \n\nOn top of that, our healthcare system is so wonky that even if the minimum wage were jacked to $50/hour tomorrow, most people would still be one rainy-day car accident away from crippling medical debt.\n\nOverall, I'm frustarted by this trend of sacrificing long-term, or even medium-term outcomes for short-term convenience. I'm extra-frustrated that a lot of the things people take issue with -- government assistance, immigrant labor, relying on charity -- are a direct result of these awful tradeoffs.

            "comment": "I have a pretty average job (that required me to have a degree) paying a pretty average wage. I also live alone in a house I own (well, have a mortgage on).\n\nI live in one of the cheapest parts of the UK in terms of house prices so my moderately sized 3 bed house has a pretty low mortgage. I'm pretty frugal, although I admit my mobile phone bill could be lower. I have a sensible car that I bought for its fuel efficiency as I commute a total of 350 miles a week (costs me about \u00a340 a week in diesel), and aside from renovating my house I don't really have much in the way of 'big' expenses outside of bills.\n\nHowever, once I take out my Utilities, my Insurance, my phone, my car, my broadband, my fuel, my food and council tax (which is a rip off), I'm normally left with a few hundred to save or spend on something I want.\n\nUnfortunately I got someone pregnant (we weren't together) and she kept it. I didn't want that to happen.\nNow my daughter is here I love her to bits but she hasn't half fucked my finances. On top of my other bills I now have to pay for Nursery and life insurance, coming out to an extra \u00a3250 a month with creative childcare arrangements and the mother paying a bit more because she earns significantly more than I do.\n\nI finish each month with \u00a3140 left.\nI pay a tiny mortgage, my water usage is so low I'm surprised the water company haven't assumed im dead, I use very little energy on a good tarrif and I save where I can, yet on an average wage in a cheap part of the country, a broken down boiler would leave me depending on borrowing. Christmas is something I honestly am dreading this year because I can't afford anything. Until my daughter goes to school, or I get a decent payrise (which reeeaaally isn't likely), my life is literally working or looking after my daughter, because I can't afford anything else. It shouldn't be this way, and I know others have it worse, but it's a fucking shit system where I genuinely may be better off if I weren't working and claiming benefits.",

In terms of disposable income, and without wanting to continue the er... \"pity party\", the weighting is still on my end. As I say, she earns a lot more than me. We're on very good terms so it was an amicable arrangement. My mum also looks after my daughter 1 day a week to keep costs down.\n\nMy point was, and perhaps given the late hour i didn't quite get to it properly, is that I'm not the worst situation. I have a decent job and have low living costs comparable to most other places, yet I am skirting disaster if something unexpected happens. What I probably should have dedicated a bit of time to, and my apologies for not doing, is the comparison to others. I could be worse, but even my semi-privilege leaves me with very little. \u00a3140 a month for savings/baby stuff/emergencies etc really isn't a lot.",

After the ww2 most governments set up systems so everyone could afford things if they work a hard full time job and have a good economy. It seems like though for the last 50 years politicians and big businesses are completely corroding everything and people are getting less and less in return for their hard labor and it seems like it's getting worse every year. It's like every great society is slowly getting eaten by unhinged capitalism and it's hurting the small earners more and more. Somewhere we need to turn around because I don't see a good future ahead for alot of people and that makes me mad. It's like politicians and big businesses don't realize that when people have more money they spend more and meanwhile a basic walmart shelf stocker can't even afford a one bedroom apartment.

Wages kept up with overall growth. Families could survive off of one income. \n\nEnter tax cuts of the 1980s (down to 28% at the top rate). Wealth at the top explodes. Now there\u2019s no reason not to be greedy AF. Wages don\u2019t rise with growth anymore. CEOs now make 600x their average worker. And people working full time can\u2019t even support themselves, much less a family. And the wealthy want more tax cuts. It\u2019s crazy. \n\nTrickle down economics helps very few people.",

The problem is you are limited in where you can live especially if rent goes up, you cannot save enough to buy a place, you cannot afford replacement cars easily, and you cannot save significant amounts for a rainy day. It\u2019s great that you are doing well now, but you should plan for any future eventualities. Eg figure out to save for a deposit to buy your own place, then take in a boarder to help with faster mortgage repayments.",

He probably makes about twice minimum wage, which is not really enough to rent a half decent apartment on his own anywhere within a reasonable commute from his work. \n\nHe's probably capable of living on his own, he can manage his basic household chores and such, drive himself to work, etc. but can't afford to. With his disabilities, even finding a roommate would be kind of a tough task, not a lot of people would exactly be lining up to live with the guy (disabilities aside, he's also just kind of a weird dude,) and even fewer could really be trusted to not take advantage of him.\n\nFor now, he's still living with his parents, but they won't be around forever. They're likely to leave him a decent bit of money, but probably not \"you don't have to worry about paying rent for the rest of your life\" money, so he's likely going to end up living at least partially on the taxpayers dime at some point.",

I went back to my bed straight after.\n\nI was supposed to go out of town for the day to visit my medium distance partner. I didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it.\n\nThe only reason I\u2019m getting out of bed tonight is to feed my cat. I feel awful.",

I know it can prove difficult but I urge you to discuss this with your partner !! Or simply just be with them. You need them the most right now of all times especially. Really proud you got up to feed your cat !! I know that couldn\u2019t have been easy. And make sure you\u2019re eating and staying hydrated, doesn\u2019t have to be a four course meal but just that you\u2019re eating at all is the most important. I\u2019m wishing you well !!",

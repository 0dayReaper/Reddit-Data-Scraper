    "postText": "I (21f) have a 9 month old son with my ex (23m).\n\nI didn\u2019t have a good childhood. There was nothing but misery my whole life. I don\u2019t want to get into details about my childhood and traumas but I will say that the trauma I have gotten from years of physical, mental, emotional, psychological and spiritual abuse I have gotten my whole life messed me up in the head so much that it has led me to be nothing but someone who has no purpose in life. And I\u2019m not being dramatic when I say that.\n\nMy ex and I have been in each other\u2019s lives since we were infants because of our moms being college acquaintances. I was in another state when we got together back in 2019 and I flew out of the state away from my friends and family 11 days after I turned 18 to be with him in January 2020. During the 3 years we\u2019ve been together I gave my ex my all and got nothing in return. The sex was always boring and he hated doing foreplay so most of the time I\u2019m dry plus he never lasted long and whenever we finished he just gets up and casually goes back to doing his own thing with no after care or anything. He never wanted to do things I was interested in because he was not interested in what I liked but then gets angry when I don\u2019t try to do things that interest him and that just because I don\u2019t like what he likes doesn\u2019t mean I shouldn\u2019t try at all to like his interests. I was emotionally neglected by him throughout our relationship but I still stayed with him out of pity because I knew no one would ever want to be with someone like him. But then I had our son.\n\nBefore I got pregnant with my son I\u2019ve always wanted to have kids but as I got older I was questioning if I really wanted kids or not and was having doubts if I actually wanted any because I had a rough childhood and thought that I\u2019ve only been wanting kids for my own benefits because of my past traumas. I\u2019ve told my ex many times about it but his excuse as to why we should have kids is because we need more good people in the world. While I do kinda agreed I started to realize little by little that motherhood might not be for me because I don\u2019t want to be responsible for another person for the rest of my life and there\u2019s so many things you have to do for a child that I do not want to do 24/7. I wanted to live out my life because unlike my ex I didn\u2019t had a childhood and being with him made me realize little by little I\u2019m wasting my life with him. And then came December 9th 2021 I tried to off myself because I was going through a lot of things mentally and emotionally but was stopped by my ex. Not even a month after the incident I found out I was pregnant after my 20th birthday. I wanted to abort because I was not in a position to have a baby because of what happened not even a moth prior plus I was falling out of love with my ex and wanted to go back to my friends and family back from another state. But my ex took advantage of what I did and used it as a way to get me to keep the pregnancy. He promised that he would change for the better if I keep the baby. And like the ignorant girl I was, I kept the pregnancy. I love my son dearly. But I\u2019d be lying if I said I don\u2019t regret aborting him. Or better yet, I wish I could\u2019ve just successfully ended my life so that I wouldn\u2019t have conceived him. Not only for the sake of myself but for the sake of my son from having a shitty father. Everything I have to do for my son are all the things I never wanted to do as a mom and there are some days I wish I could just run away or give my son up for adoption but I just can\u2019t do that to him because my son didn\u2019t ask to be born and shouldn\u2019t be punished because of my life issues.\n\nthe state where my friends and family are which is in Florida. I originally was going to move there but the prices in FL have been rising up more and I couldn\u2019t find an apartment that fits my budget. I\u2019m a high school drop out and I\u2019m on disability because I have mental deficiencies and with my income I would not be able to survive in FL. So I decided to stay in FL for a couple of months to be with my loved ones. Which I loved and hate because although I was only there for my friends dealing with my family and their bs was hell. I eventually came back to my home state a week before my son turned 8 months old. The first time I saw my ex his hair was long and greasy. His teeth were not brushed and his breath smell horrid. I think what caught me off gourd the most was his hight. He\u2019s a lot shorter than I remembered. Honestly I was so worried that I would fall for him again when I saw him but seeing him again especially like that gave me the icks and made me loose even more interest in him. He looked like that and had the audacity to ask to get back together. Like ew dude, NO!\n\nEver since I came back home my ex keeps pressuring me to get back together and no matter how many times I tell him to stop he keeps being touchy and always tries to kiss me as if he is still entitled to my body. I want to kick him out of the apartment but his parents are moving to Texas soon and he has no friends to live with plus he just recently lost his job so he can\u2019t get his own place. But before he lost his job he would guilt trip me on how he will be homeless and how he won\u2019t be able to see his son or help me with our son and how him paying for his own apartment would make it hard for him to give me money to help support our child. Recently this guy also had the nerve to request 5 hours of him relaxing from any responsibility including our child. Was 4 months of being away from your son not enough for you to not want to have breaks from him? He says he hated that I mostly had to raise our son by myself because he wanted to be there for all the time he has been away from our son but his behavior and attitude on when I ask him for any help related to our son says otherwise. Idk what to do with him.\n\nI really hate how my life turned out to be. I hate that I have no support group. I hate the sadness and loneliness I feel everyday. I hate that I have no way out of this mess with my ex. I hate that I am tied to him for the rest of my life. I hate that I have mom responsibilities. I hate that to this day I still constantly want to end my own life. I hate that my life and existence is meaningless. I hate that my life keeps getting worse and worse and no matter what i do my life is still full of nothing but misery as it has always been since birth. I hate that my son is the reason I won\u2019t ever end my own life because as much as I don\u2019t want to live anymore because I literally don\u2019t have a purpose in this world I just wouldn\u2019t do that to my baby and I don\u2019t trust my ex nor my family to raise my son. But most importantly I hate that I wish my son was never born.\n\nI love my son. But I hate that he is keeping me here to continue living.",

    "postText": "This is my throw away account because this is one of my deepest secrets that I\u2019ve never been able to anyone. \nFor background information my brother and I did not grow up with our parents because they were drug addicts and alcoholics. When we lived with them we were later told that we both were victims of abuse (SA included) and neglect. We left that home when I was 5 and he was 4) we are only a little over a year apart. \n\nThis all began when I was in second grade. My dad just got out of jail and was living his parents and us. He went back into jail soon there after and left a lot of his belongings behind. Including those playboy type magazines. As a second grader I saw them and initially felt weird inside but didn\u2019t know what to do or why so I started looking stuff up online here and there and as I reached the age closer to 11 I was full on addicted to porn. I was watching it all day long and had no real concept of what I was going through ( I was also homeschooled ). Push came to shove and my brother actually caught me looking at porn. He became curious as well. While I\u2019m not confident it was my idea, I want to blame myself for what came next. We never had sex but we did touch each other like the videos we watched. Just typing this makes me sick. This did not last long because eventually my grandma caught me by going through my search history. I was grounded for over a month, I wasn\u2019t allowed to wear a towel out of the shower because \u201cI was so comfortable looking at other naked people\u201d and from that point on my brother and I have never talked about it again. Sometimes I wonder if that is the reason my brother hates me so much, and why we barely talk. And the other part of me is nervous he\u2019s told someone else. I don\u2019t know why I did it, but even thinking about it now makes me sick to my stomach.",

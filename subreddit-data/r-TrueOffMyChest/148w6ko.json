I've known her since we were six and I love her to death but I just don't really know why she thinks this. I'm probably missing something but I just really need advice and also I just need to tell someone about it. For the record I don't hate her and I'm not sure if I should tell her or not. For a little context this sounds a little silly but I was looking through her TikTok reposts and saw one on a sad edit and the repost said I'm starting to think my friends hate me and its not like she said this months or years ago she only posted that like one month ago so I know it's recent. My birthday party is on Saturday so I was thinking of maybe telling her I know then but I just don't know what to do and I have a huge lump in my throat just thinking about it but I just needed to tell someone and maybe someone will have some advice for me.",

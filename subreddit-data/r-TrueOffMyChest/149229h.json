    "postText": "posting this because everyone in my life knows her and despite all of what i\u2019m about to write i\u2019d never talk about someone to anyone who has any ties to that person (other than my boyfriend) but i need to vent somewhere\n\ni spent the last two years of college with a roommate that i had the oddest relationship with. outwardly and usually truly we were best friends. could tell anything to each other, personalities meshed super well, hung out all the time. but underneath that we had some weird underlying tension which led to weird competition with one another on both ends. there would be periods that we wouldn\u2019t talk and it would be super tense in the apartment but we\u2019d always switch at some point to being best friends. it was odd. \n\nwe had a lot of conflicts. the biggest was 6 months in to living together when she threw an extended mental health \u201ccrisis\u201d on my shoulders until i called the cops to handle it instead of me after a month od dealing. genuinely one of the most stressful times in my life- hearing loud performative screaming melt downs conveniently whenever my boyfriend was over (who she made a move on as soon as he expressed interest in me despite knowing him for years without any interest). our relationship never really recovered i guess and j think my empathy is permanently altered from it i am definitely more cold and harsh now. \n\nafter that came problems with accountability. she refused to take any sort of responsibility for her own actions. whether that be panicking and melting down to me about running out of meds when she wouldn\u2019t schedule an appointment in time but blamed the system or complaining that people didn\u2019t like her when she caused problems. \n\nthe weird competition came in the form of subtly talking shit about me to my friends or potential friends. not direct gossping but dropping my negative traits casually (not me wronging her; like casually telling people my supposed flaws &amp; completely over selling them to make them thing less of me) and complaining to mutual friends about any inconvenience and throwing it on me to make me look bad (ex: i ask her to take out the trash and suddenly the world needs to know how unreasonable i am)\n\nanother thing was stealing friends. i would have no problem sharing friends but a pattern of me losing a friend the second she met them happened. as soon as she met one of my friends suddenly she needed to spend every moment with them gradually cutting me out until we never talked and they were best friends. particularly all my male friends. happened every time with a male friend but suddenly she knew how to normally hang out when it was female. weird. \n\neven with all this we acted like best friends and regularly did nice things for each other unprompted. i went out of my way to find a super rare vinyl she wanted and surprised her with it, she threw me a surprise party, etc. we had infinite inside jokes, hung out, went to events together. and genuinely enjoyed spending time with each other. it was so strange that we were best friends sometimes but in competition at other times. \n\ni\u2019ve always been iffy about remaining friends after graduation and considered ending our friendship (and our lease) several times. but i genuinely enjoyed spending time with her so i\u2019d push it all aside. \n\nmy last straw was a couple weeks ago at move out when our lease was up after graduation. she planned on leaving all her heavy furniture that she didn\u2019t want on me to deal with. i had to force her to stay and move it with me. not all was done so she told me she planned on coming back before it expired to finish with me. well, we went to a music festival together two days before the lease was up and she informed me she wouldn\u2019t be coming back. she told me her mom would basically ruin her life if she came back because she\u2019s super controlling. i told her i\u2019d have to leave the festival early so i could do it myself. once she realized i was being serious she suddenly decided she could come back later to help. i asked if she just lied to get out of her own responsibility and she had no words. couldnt even deny it. so i left. from that moment on i was genuinely so put off from her that i have no urge to ever talk to her again. i feel no loss at all, it was like how some people get an \u201cick\u201d and lose all romantic feelings for someone immediately except platonically. \n\ni\u2019ll always look back fondly on our friendship and all of the highs and don\u2019t think she\u2019s a bad person. but i\u2019m fully over it and just needed one last vent. sorry this was so long i don\u2019t expect a single response, been holding it in for a while. i don\u2019t think i truly sold how much we were supposedly best friends but take my word. very odd relationship dynamic and i\u2019m glad it\u2019s over. i\u2019m also not absolved of blame- i certainly played defense and participated in the competition culture although i never initiated and it was always out of retaliation. i\u2019ll admit i was always jealous of her in some way- she\u2019s much more beautiful than me and i was jealous that she was able to get so much attention because she was so likable to everyone at first meeting. i also suspect a lot of hers came from jealousy of me for a lot of things i have going for me. i\u2019m still not innocent but i do think i was a much better friend to her even if not perfect. okay, rant over. i just wish i had someone to send our niche memes to now, lol",

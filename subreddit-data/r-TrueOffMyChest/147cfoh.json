    "postText": "Forgive me for any typos, I just needed to tell someone about this. I'm a 15f and I have two older siblings. A sister (19f) we'll call Angel and a brother (22m) we'll call Jamie.\n\nFor some backstory, Angel is currently in a very prestigious university in our country, learning how to become a marine biologist and Jamie is building his own company and doesn't live at home but comes back to visit quite often. When Angel got into the university she also earned a full-ride scholarship. She was also valedictorian and one of the most decorated graduates at her school. Idk how she got so many cords for graduation but I know she looked like a rainbow and worked hard for them. Jamie on the other hand, tested out of high school and never went to university. Jamie has always been a go with a flow kind of guy while Angel as been a silent and hard-working person.\n\nOur mom is a nurse at our hospital and our dad teaches at the high school. Only recently have I noticed that Jamie is THE golden child while I come second to him. Growing up Angel always looked out for me, took the blame when I did something bad, and treated me with so much love and respect. My mom worked long hours and often times back-to-back shifts so she wasn't always available and when she was she was exhausted but she would push away the exhaustion to be there for me. Dad was the usual parent that would pick us up and drop us off at school and watch us at home.\n\nJamie never needed help with homework and usually watched TV when we got home. Angel always helped me with my homework while our dad would grade assignments and get dinner started. Angel never let me feel stupid because I didn't understand my homework and she never let me give up. She explained everything to me and answered even my dumbest of questions.\n\nWhen I felt sick, had a nightmare, or in general needed anything, Angel was usually there helping me. When I went to my parents I felt bad because my mom was exhausted and my dad acted like it was a burden for him. Every accomplishment I had was celebrated by Angel no matter how small. If I failed a test or an assignment, Angel never shamed me or told me to do better she just asked if I did my best and that my best was more than enough even if a teacher couldn't see that.\n\nWhen Jamie turned 13, our dad started drinking even more than he had before. Our mom was struggling enough with her own demons and Jamie was either blind to it or ignored it for his own sanity. Whenever our parents would fight, Angel would bring me to her room and we would build a pillow fort and she would distract me. Only now do I realize that late at night after Angel helped me fall asleep, she would begin doing her homework and silently clean the house. I think she was cleaning up broken class when one of our parents broke something during a fight.\n\nI guess I'm mainly saying that Angel was my rock in our immediate family. Our extended family always treated her poorly and most forgot about her existence. She was the silent glue for the family that no one cared about. She was criticized for every little thing she did no matter what. She either ate to much or too little according to the women in our family. I remember one of our cousins making pig noises when Angel went to get a second serving at Thanksgiving one year but I remember that she hadn't eaten at all that day to 'make room' for the dinner.\n\nAngel came home recently to take care of the house while our mom went on a month long vacation with some friends in Europe. A much deserved trip. Our dad hasn't been doing well because of his drinking and Angel offered to come home mainly for me. Not only did she want me to enjoy being a teenager without responsibility but she didn't want me to home alone with our dad. Even now she is taking her classes online while taking of both my dad and I alongside the house and our animals. \n\nI'm also only now realizing that she drinks this really caffeinated coffee to have energy and to seem happier than she is. I know being home depresses her and makes her anxiety skyrocket. She has probably been my only real parent my entire life and I don't know how to tell her how much I love and appreciate her. \n\nI need to say that when I call her Angel on her it's because she is a literal Angel. She lost her childhood to our parents and older brother but instead of being bitter she protected and loved me. She is also an Angel because she never complains or gets upset. She could be an angry and bitter person because of how she grew up but instead she wants to spend her life helping animals and their homes. She could've been horrible to me but instead she has shown me nothing but love and raised me to be a good person. I don't know how I'm going to approach her tomorrow, but I know she deserves an apology and a hug.",

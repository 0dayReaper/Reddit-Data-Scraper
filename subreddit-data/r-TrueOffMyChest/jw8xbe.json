She *very much* has the ability to work from home. \n\nA lot of her friends who work in the same industry, they've all been home for months with no signs of going back soon. Her employer is pretty much the only one of its type in the area to stay open, the rest have closed. \n\nAnd so she's been at work pretty much this entire time, just in case she needs to \"meet with a client\", even though she can do that online too, which 95% of people do anyway. They've installed webcams at everyone's desks so they can have Zoom meetings with people... But nope, she's \"essential\" so she goes in every day. \n\nAnd they have their weekly Zoom meetings where the manager in charge of Covid, who's working exclusively from home by the way, talks about all of the things they can do to stay safe, including \"working from home if you can\", but *you can't* because \"you're essential\". Isn't it weird how the bosses get to stay home but nobody else does?",

The owners have never completely shut down, only closed a couple of locations, and that's only because they would be risking people by having them in these smaller locations. Anyways, my state never issued a mask mandate or a lockdown, so those greedy fucks are like, \"Well, we'll stay open because we don't give a shit about our employees and will run them into the ground to get our prissy, bitchy customers their coffee.\" I get wanting \"artisan\" coffee, but I'm willing to bet 95% of people have a drip coffee pot at home. Make that shit yourself, you selfish fucks.\n\nEdit: Since it is not obviously apparent, I am venting. I am not asking you to explain how I should be grateful for income (I am) and being explained to how a capitalist system works. I literally do not care. What I do care about is being treated like a human being, not some organic coffee making machine that can run and run and run without ever breaking down, which is how I and about three other of our full-time employees are being treated. I am upset over a number of things about this. You do not know the full story of what my life is like right now or has been like in the past few months, so step off.\n\nEdit 2: It should be noted that those smaller locations have since opened up again, despite their apprehension to keeping people together in a small space barely the size of a decent walk-in closet.",

Lotta filthy stuff in there, but also in a documentary I saw Ramsay in his own damn restaurant - taking a towel off his shoulder and using it to wipe someone's plate just before serving. In one case, even licked the towel to wipe something stuck there. Isn't that pretty horrific? I'd rather a glop of food on a clean plate than Gordon Ramsay's spit, however little of it there was there, or germs from a towel off his shoulder. Thoughts?\n\nEdit: [Ramsay licking a towel and wiping your plate](https://youtu.be/_JWsiLmLhZg?t=3194)",

My union had a contract with a production company that 'folded' and restarted under a different name in order to try to get rid of us. Thankfully we won the case in court and kept the labour contract but it shows what lengths people will go to.",

Once I finally received my 2018 tax returns, I received my stimulus check like a week or two after. I had both my tax returns setup for direct deposit so it helped get my stimulus check faster, but if you didn't do direct deposit then it may take even longer to receive it in the mail. \n\nHopefully you get yours soon!",

We have many, insanely dense metropolises with limited hospital space. \n\n*Per the first link I shared below(http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1070348_DHSCOVID-19Dashboard.pdf), COVID+ patients aged 1-49 spend an avg of 3 days in the hospital, COVID+ aged 50+ spend an avg of 5 days each. Take a look at the first graph showing total available beds between March 16th to November 17th showing a consistent downward trend. \n\nRegardless of how inaccurate the reporting of hospital occupancy has been these past few months, winter has come and we are suddenly receiving a massive influx of people testing positive. The vaccine is being rushed but (I believe) the closest trial in consideration for the U.S. is in Phase III. At this rate it would not be released until early 2022 (https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/800/cpsprodpb/111E2/production/_114241107_vaccine_timeline_v62x-nc.png). Also, someone who received the trial vaccine in Brazil died(COD still under investigation). If proven to be a direct result of the vaccine, I would expect a vaccine around 2023-2024 at the earliest. Per the data I shared, we could be at full hospital capacity by January 1(given current severity + deep winter is coming).\n\n#2 Our hospitals are in debt and money HUNGRY! ER visits lasting just an hour or two can end up costing more than you make in a year just from running a few simple tests. COVID gave an opportunity for hospitals to make a profit.\n\n*Hospitals receive average Medicare payment at $13,297 for a less severe hospitalization and $40,218 for hospitalization in which a patient is treated with a ventilator for at least 96 hours.\n\n#3 We have received ONE government stipend, enough for some to live for 2-4 weeks. Most people will risk infection and continue working high traffic jobs to provide for their families.\n\n#4 Politics got involved\n\n#5 *Coincidentally,* during this entire pandemic, the country has been protesting/rioting in all major cities over George Floyd and police reform.\n\n#6 People here are stupid\n\nThere is much, much more but I just can't list it all. The repercussions of how this has been handled will be significantly worse than September 11, 2001. All of the small restaurant chains near me that I love, have closed down permanently. Suicide is up, the economy is collapsing and all we hear about every day is Biden and Trump.\n\nOne thing I just found, very interesting, Hispanics(at least in L.A.) seem to have been affected significantly more than any other race(74%), especially compared to white hospitalizations(2%) even though per the demographics there are more white people in L.A. http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1070348_DHSCOVID-19Dashboard.pdf\n What????

WA has had 9 deaths, my city has had around 250. I think considered the fact that there's near two thousand times more people per square kilometre and we've only had 25 times as many deaths the difference isn't actually so bad and we've done reasonably ok with the struggle that we're facing here.",

Only about half of our country actually went on lockdown as it was up to the individual states and sometimes local counties to make those decisions. Which anyone with half a brain knew it wouldn't work unless we were all shut down.. \n\nAlso since the beginning of the lockdown we were told conflicting information about the magnitude of the pandemic from our president and health professionals. Hell, the cdc even told us not to wear masks in the beginning of the pandemic and that added more fuel to the misinformation and conspiracy theories. \n\nPlus whatever mandates that would be passed on the state and local levels would be enforced if lucky.. that's mostly attributed to the majority of law enforcement here are trump supporters; and so of course they too thought the virus was blown out of proportion and these mandates were nonsensical. Some have even come out publicly in numerous counties of the state i reside in, CA to not enforce those laws. Don't even get me started about Texas.. Our country is so big it's hard even for us Americans to keep track of who is doing what.",

Basically there are things the national government can do, but the 10th amendment to our constitution says that anything not outlined in the constitution is stuff reserved for state and local governments. It would require a declaration of a state of national emergency, which is an executive power. Our current president is certainly not going to do that. \n\nEven relatively progressive places like California saw protests against lockdowns and mask mandates, and a subsequent lack of political willpower to enforce any of the rules except for the worst offenders (repeat offenders of very large parties actually got arrested).  \n\nYou can walk into most stores without a mask and just say you have a medical condition, and the management will let you in without it, because they're more concerned about someone complaining to the corporate office or tweeting about it than they are about the lives of their other customers and employees.",

Since our leader was hands off, it became a state by state issue, meaning governors had to make the choice to shutdown and to what extent. Shutdowns are not popular especially in red states, nobody was rushing to be the first guy to shut things down. So the bluest states shutdown first, while having neighbor states completely open. \n\nNow the stage we are in, is bare minimum lockdowns. So mask while inside and everything else is normal. \n\nJust throwing it out into the universe. The usa from the start was in a bad situation. First covid case was november 17th in china, first death in america was around december 20th. So we had 3 full months at minimum where this thing got to spread. We were easily at 100k cases back in april.",

Im guaranteed minimum wage of $7.50 if I don't make enough;  I've never lived above my means,  which up until 6 months ago was roughly $14-$20 an hour.  Im trying to pay for an apartment I could comfortably afford in January with less than half of what I made in January.  Plus I lost my job of 6 years in March (which I HAD accrued sick days if I feel ill;  now I don't have any pto) so I'm afraid my bank is gonna see that I have only held my current job for 4 months and deny me a car loan even though my credit is good (not to mention my credit cards have consistently been extremely high for the last few months when they never were before)\n\n I ran out of unemployment benefits weeks ago.  Im getting $6000 for the car and totaling it might be the best thing thats happened in a while because I can use half of that money to pay off other debt and rent if my bank approved the loan.\n\nI don't know what Im gonna do.

What about local restaurants open for take out. If those don\u2019t stay open for take out or delivery, most will not open back up again.",

Sadly, a lot of people feed their families and themeselves with cheap fast food, because it's one of the only options they have.\n\nI learned this when I was doing research on Child Obesity, and why we allow parents to kill their kids with fast food, even though we statistically know it's bad for us, and ultimately leads to fatal health issues. I went into it very critical of parents that get fast food for their children, and came out of it with a different mindset.\n\nSadly, some people can only afford a single $1 cheeseburger a day per person.

I was \"essential\" at a bakery for a large grocery store chain and everyone would take off their mask as soon as they got inside, and then get pissed when I asked them to keep it on AT LEAST while they were talking to me. I got in trouble with my manager for this. If I had gotten sick I'd be shit out of luck because I can't afford to miss work, yet the people I worked for would do nothing to ensure the safety of their workers.",

I was told by my bosses and most all of my other co-workers that I didn't need to wear my mask. I politely told them them since I worked drive thru and handled money I felt that I was at higher risk, but I felt truly most unsafe by my coworkers. I don't know if this is true at other fast-food places, or also true about other lines of work, but I felt that I was at particularly high risk at work. \nI too am concerned for fast-food employees.",

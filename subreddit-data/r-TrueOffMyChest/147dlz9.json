    "postText": "Tw:suicide\nI should mention he did attempt suicide years ago.\nI (m/15 [14 at the time]) had a friend (m/16), who i cut off as of now, who we'll call jack. About three months ago he shoots me a text over discord asking if he a bad person. I said he wasn't, and he said \"really? Because I've been thinking with this .45 in my hand\". Already, off of that sentence alone I knew what was happening, and I managed to talk him out of it, and we talked about how if it was his friends that brought him to do this he can cut them off, and he replied with shit like cut=kill and I really couldn't tell if he was joking, if it was a test, or if it was just some kind of hate towards them, but I was focused on his wellbeing and called the police to tell them he was on the verge of suicide and should talk to him. After a couple days of radio silence from him and worrying he wasn't even alive he finally showed up again venting about how the situation got him expelled, as the school was thinking of the list jack sent as a hit list, and thought he was going to shoot up the school, which led them to talk to the kids he listed off. One of these kids, who we'll call eric(m/15) ended up trying to help too, and getting the same treatment. A couple weeks went by, he talked about how he was getting better (and still talking about how he'd beat the everlasting shit out of the person who called the police on him since he's a blackbelt) when we were talking over discord and he just kinda broke down. I won't go into detail, mainly because I forgot and left the gc he was in so I can't check, and really showed off that he was not getting better. We all told him therapy would be the best option, but he insisted that it \"twists you\". I finally cut him off and learned how much of a bullet I dodged. I was talking to his ex on discord, since she was in the gc he was in, and she told me that he was holding her by suicide hostage talking about how if he wasn't with her he'd kill himself. This story stretches from about 4/21 to 6/09 2023. I'm entirely disconnected from jack now, and so is Eric. I'm honestly just disappointed it took me this long to cut him off.",

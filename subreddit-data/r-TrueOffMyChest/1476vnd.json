    "postText": "Not looking for advice just wanted to get the frustration out. My finances have been garbage since being laid off last year. I'm back working with full benefits but the hit that my accounts took in the meantime were hard. I've been trying to build my savings account back up but with everything being so unnecessarily expensive these days that's been kind of hard. Now as I sit here minding my business I bite into a protein bar and hit an almond and broke my tooth. Literally don't need this right now. Very first world problems but still. Rant over. Ugh. Just ugh \ud83d\ude2b",

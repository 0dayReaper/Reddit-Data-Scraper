    "postText": "Mid 30s here. Normally not one to complain but today is my birthday and it sucked. So I\u2019m going to be a whiny bitch.\n\nMarried, sole bread winner. Wife is a stay at home mom.\n\nMy birthday present requests:\n1. An enthusiastic BJ (This was a happy request she can decline, not a demand)\n2. Breakfast made for me (even a bowl of cereal I dont care just a little effort and showing that they care)\n\nBirthday timeline:\n\nWake up at 6am, super quick vanilla quicky with wife (no BJ) Toddler cries as we\u2019re finishing. So ends super quick(er).\n\n6:15 Take my kid downstairs, make him breakfast, roll some cars around. He\u2019s cute.  don\u2019t make myself breakfast, that would be fucking sad after my request.\n\n7:45 Wife heads across to another city for a 100% unimportant PTA type meeting she could totally skip if she wanted to. I see her off, don\u2019t even get a \u2018happy birthday\u2019.\n\n7:45 -&amp;gt; 8:30 I do the housework (like most days) prep the child, walk him to daycare go to my office to start work.\n\nBirthday breakfast was a plastic wrapped convenience store scone.\n\n8:30 -&amp;gt; 11:30 work, child #2 (was at a friends the night before) gets sent home from school due to being sick\u2026. Even though she\u2019s not sick. I leave work, take her home and look after her. Wife still in pointless PTA. I remind kid it\u2019s my birthday and I get an \u2018oh I forgot, happy birthday\u2019. Make sandwiches for her and generally keep her happy. We play a few rounds of video games together. She\u2019s rubbish at them but adorable too.\n\n13:30 kid goes to grandmas, I go back to work.\n\n17:00 wife gets back from PTA meeting, finds i have taken the ~$12 she left on my card / money / wallet pile assuming it was mine. Apparently she received it from someone and didn\u2019t write down how much it was. Get aggressively lectured for no reason.\n\nShe is \u2018too tired\u2019 to pick up toddler. I rush to go do it.\n\n17:30 She asks what I\u2019ve prepared for the kids dinner\u2026 ahh, I was working?!? I try to suggest cheerfully, hey it\u2019s my birthday let\u2019s Uber something tasty! get told off for that taking to long and told to \u2018make something\u2019 - so I make the kids some ravioli.\n\n18:00 Wife grumpily folds a few towels from the 3 loads of washing I did. Then goes to play with her phone in our bedroom while I feed the children.\n\n18:30 Birthday dinner was ravioli scraps and some toast, too burned out to be fucked making anything at that point.\n\n19:00 I bathe the kids and feed them a slice of birthday cake I bought. I invite wife downstairs for cake. Nope.\n\n20:00 I bring the kids upstairs to bed, put the big one to bed and the little one decides he wants to cuddle mommy.\n\n20:30 Big kid falls asleep. Wife falls asleep next to little one.\n\n20:30 -&amp;gt; 22:00 clean up the kitchen and two kids worth of carnage by myself.\n\nThat\u2019s it. Birthday done.\n\n22:00 -&amp;gt; now I mindlessly scroll Reddit wishing someone cared about me, not just needed me for money / food / changing diapers.\n\nHonestly a card, a letter, a cuddle and a \u2018happy birthday\u2019, a fucking coffee made for me. Any glimmer of hope that someone cared would have been enough\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve got money, food and a roof over my head. I know at the end of the day it\u2019s not so bad and I\u2019m just being a bitch. But I guess it\u2019s a bit lonely hey.\n\n\n\nEdit \u2014-\nI\u2019ve no idea why this blew up while I was sleeping. But thanks for the birthday wishes internet friends. It\u2019s weird that it helps, but it does!\n\nEdit 2 \u2014\nI said PTA type meeting because I didn\u2019t want to dox myself. I\u2019m familiar with what she\u2019s doing and the large group she was with. There is a new school campus being built in said city and they have day long steering meetings (and get a nice cafe lunch with the other mums provided, I should have skipped work for the meeting ha!)\n\nEdit 3 (as I read the comments) \u2014\nI understand leading with the sex thing is douchy. I just hate that I was \u2018gifted\u2019 what should be a normal part of a marriage.\n\nEdit 4 -\nJust approached the topic with the wife. I\u2019m not good at articulating these things so I wrote it down.\n\nHer response was \u201cis this going to make me feel worse? If so I don\u2019t want to read it\u201d\n\nEdit 5 - \nSo, I've got 150+ DMS, most of which are people sending their love. Once nice girl offering to send her boobs (lol!) and another offering to send a card I guess today wasn't so bad after all.\n\nGuys, with 4.5k comments and 150+ dms there is no way I can reply to your birthday wishes, but I'm reading them and I appreciate you all!\n\nEdit 6 -\nSince this started getting shared in other communities I should mention I said I \n 'clearly' requested a BJ in the OP. 'Clearly' as in I asked friendly and directly; I didn't mention it in passing in a way that might be missed or forgotten. Not 'clearly' as in demanded.\n\nReddit you all need to calm down about it. It's OK. to ask your spouse for a sexual favor, it's also ok for them to decline.\n\nEdit 7 ---\nLots of people asking what I did for wifes bday:\n\nI bought her some Airpods pros and a full frame Sigma art 50mm f1.4 lens. Woke up early and cooked her favorite breakfast with kid. (using home-cured gravlax I prepared from a week earlier because it's her fav.) Kid did garnishes and help make foam hearts in her coffee.\n\nGave her presents &amp; card. Sang happy birthday goofily every time I handed her anything throughout the day and generally tried to keep the day as upbeat as possible. Ate dinner with her fam (I ordered her favorite). Gave her a flower before bed so she could go to sleep with a smile. Generally lots of smiles and happiness that day.\n\nIt's the one day of the year you can go out of your way to remind someone that they are loved and you were happy they were born. I don't go out of the way for many people but IMO your spouse is the one you should do it for.\n\nTo be clear, I didn't expect anything to the scale of above. But any kind of indication they cared would have been good. Shit, don't cure gravlax for a week, just pour some cereal for me and I would be like 'holy shit, she cares!'",

The \u201csomething missing\u201d is communication.\n\nFor all we know, wife spent those 9 hours running around to extremely important appointments, errands, offices, commitments. She very well may have been justified in being exhausted at the end of the day. But if all she can portray to husband is \u201cI have to go to the PTA meeting\u201d and then doesn\u2019t give any info beyond that, of course husband is going to have no idea wtf is going on and why she\u2019s so worn out.

But it implies a lack of communication in the relationship that is clearly having a detrimental effect. Do people have to give minute by minute itineraries of their days to their partners? Of course not. But if it\u2019s to the point that your partner somehow misunderstood that you were at a PTA meeting for 9 hours, communication might need some improvement for the health of the marriage.",

My wife suffered from PPD after our child was born, and because she didn't take the recovery very seriously, it turned into more severe general depression. It's not easy, and many people think I shouldn't have stuck it out for as long as I have. But I love her, and as frustrated as I am, I'd rather my child grow up in a clean house with clean laundry and a home cooked meal than have yet another fight about how she doesn't contribute much. Am I exhaused? All the time. Am I happy? Comes and goes. I've decided that so long as she's trying to get better, then I'll keep doing what I have to.\n\nOP's wife may be in a similar boat, depressed, not emotionally connecting with the family, addicted to social media/phone games as a means to cope/hide from her life. She may very well know she isn't doing a great job as a stay-at-home-spouse, and it may be making things worse. She may need to realize that and get help, and OP may need to communicate that he feels like he's being over worked and doing a disproportional amount of the work. If she comes back fighting, he may need to put his foot down and say it's either she gets help or they both go for couples counseling. If she still refuses, then she is likely not going to get any better and staying together may no longer be the best option.",

Sounds like there's a lack of respect there. And you mentioned that she was \"too tired\" to pick up the child. What's the point of being a SAHM if there's complaining when doing SAHM duties? \nIf this keeps going, sadly the kids are going to notice this dynamic and the lack of respect your wife has for you and that will become into even more issues down the road and/or they will expect that to be the norm for relationships.",

That is because I did all the things I wanted others to do for me and it felt great.\n\nNext year try planning a day for yourself that you want. Order yourself your favorite cake, book a massage, get yourself flowers, go for a nice walk..whatever that makes you happy that you wish someone else did for you.\n\nWhen you treat yourself well, take good care of yourself, and do nice things for yourself...its 10x better than anyone doing it for you. I was also told that when people see you treating yourself good it makes them either step up or fall off! \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Kid did garnishes and help make foam hearts in her coffee.  \nGave her presents &amp; card. Sang happy birthday goofily every time I handed her anything throughout the day and generally tried to keep the day as upbeat as possible. Ate dinner with her fam (I ordered her favorite). Gave her a flower before bed. Generally lots of smiles and happiness that day.  \nIt's the one day of the year you can go out of your way to remind someone that they are loved and you were happy they were born. I don't go out of the way for many people but IMO your spouse is the one you should do it for.  \nTo be clear, I didn't expect anything to the scale of above. But any kind of indication they cared would have been good. Shit, don't cure gravlax for a week, just pour some cereal for me and I would be like 'holy shit, she cares!'",

I was ready to hover over the keys that spell \"boo bloody hoo\" because I find it exhausting with adults who whine about their bdays. \nHowever, this hits different. \n\nI kind of get the feeling it wasn't necessarily so much about it being your birthday, but rather a day where you had an 'excuse' to let it be a day for YOU. You didn't expect to be served hand and foot, you didn't expect a massive party and kids being on their best behaviour etc. \nIt sounds like you wanted a bit of a break from the grind and the issues you're facing in your marriage. \nAnd that is an okay request and shouldn't happen only because it's a birthday. \n\nI read some of your comments- your wife is depressed and you got young kids. I'm assuming it's hard for you both to get time where you get that extra TLC. \n\nIt's a shame how your wife has been reacting. I'm sorry it was such a rubbish day for you. \nAs many have likely said, it sounds like you need to perhaps regain some effective communication in your relationship. Depression changes, perhaps there's new/different things you can do to support her which she hasn't voiced.\nPerhaps you can help her understand your needs to feel valued and supported. \nKids make things harder most of the time, make sure you get time for each other without the kids if possible. \n\nThose are my two cents. Again I'm sorry it was such a bad day and I wish you and the family the best",

    "postText": "My partner and I have been going out for a year and a half now. No matter how hard I try to get on with her we just don\u2019t seem to have that relationship I would\u2019ve liked to have with someone who could potentially be my mother-in-law. I am extremely close with my mum though.\n\nI don\u2019t know how many arguments this has now created with my boyfriend because obviously she is his mum and would do anything for her, I suppose it\u2019s hard to see when it\u2019s someone close to you that you love. \n\nShe lets me stay at her house as he lives with his mum and I live with mine but we go from house to house so I suppose you could argue that she doesn\u2019t completely hate me as I\u2019m allowed to stay but on the other hand, she knows that if I\u2019m not allowed to stay that he would be living at mine. I would like to add I don\u2019t ever stop him from seeing her or his family, I always encourage him to spend time with them but we are both grown adults in our 20\u2019s and work full time so it\u2019s hard to make time for everyone.\n\nWhen we stay at her house she will offer to do all of his washing but I have to take mine home unless I say I desperately need something washed and she will say she always offers. When I\u2019m there she will ask my boyfriend how his day has been and talk to him as she completely ignores me or just says \u2018hi you alright\u2019 and that\u2019s it. \n\nI haven\u2019t been keeping well lately, I collapsed and as I was waking up I heard her say to my boyfriend \u2018she\u2019s just at it, looking for attention, we\u2019ll take her home and you can spend a night with me\u2019 meanwhile if my partner gets so much as a paper cut it is the end of the world.\n\nWe also done a lot of work for her to help her out doing errands, I took time away from family to help out so she sees that I actually do want to make an effort to which she bought him gifts to say thanks for helping out and gave him them in front of me which is fair enough but she didn\u2019t have to do it in front of me.\n\nI have tried to bring this up to my partner and at one point he did say to her she was barely making an effort to talk to me but she just said she had been busy. I\u2019ve tried to bring this up to my partner again and he said I have a big problem with his family and that I\u2019m out of order which has me feeling terrible. I feel like this is all in my head because it\u2019s no big deal but it also is\u2026 \n\nI have nobody to talk to about this because then I just look like an ***hole. \n\nI just wish things would get better and everyone would get on okay.",

Now she also has you part time and you expect her to wash your clothes if she does so for her son.  it is ridiculous she still washes his clothes, does she still do everything else for him?",

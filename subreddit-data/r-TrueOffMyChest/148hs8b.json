    "postText": "I (20F) have a younger half brother (17M). **The incident happened a few years ago back when I was 16 and he was 13.**\n\n  \nFor context, our caretakers left us home alone for a few days because they went on a vacation abroad without us. I, as the older sister, had to take care of my brother while they were away. We had enough food to survive.\n\n  \nThings were going fine on the first day, he was playing video games all day. At times he'd get mad at the game and he'd lash out on me, hitting me or telling me horrible things to make me cry. At some point we were constantly fighting. Knowing he's a violent kid, I tried not to get myself in trouble. I should also note that he's bigger and taller than me, I have a smaller frame and I'm physically weaker than him, even to this day.\n\n  \nThe second day started about the same, he was on the game the whole time and he was refusing to help me out with chores. His computer was in our bedroom. I entered the bedroom and laid on my bed to rest and play on my phone. At some point he came over to my bed and started play fighting with me. I was trying to push him away but couldn't. The play fighting turned more sexual, as he started spreading my legs, getting between them and kissing my neck, groping me and all that. I told him something along the lines of \"wtf are you doing, I'm your sister\" and what he said stuck with me forever: \"It's okay, you're only my half sister after all\". I started screaming and trying to push him away but he was laughing and didn't care at all. At some point he stopped and returned back to his computer as if nothing happened.  \nI was shocked and didn't know what to do. We acted as if nothing happened until our caretakers returned the next day. I told my mom about what he did and she made him read a book about incest but didn't punish him or anything. \n\n  \n(For the record, I've been awoken by him inspecting my breasts through my shirt back when we were even younger and he used to tell me that he wants to marry me.)\n\n  \nBack to the present day, I have a normal relationship with my brother, we both grew up. He has a girlfriend now. We both act as if the incident never happened but sometimes I can't help but think about it and feel disgusted by him. I don't usually admit it, but the incident scarred and traumatized me. Sometimes I can't help but wonder why he did it and I feel sad. That's why I decided to write about it so many years later. Maybe I shouldn't have forgiven him.",

                    "comment": "He never apologized and he never showed any remorse for his actions. I forgave him because my family makes family gatherings/dinners very often and I see him there. They want us to be on good terms. I'm very dumb for forgiving him, but my family calls me \"dramatic\" anytime I try to bring up the incident. They tell me I'm overreacting and that I have a \"weak victim mentality\", which is why I never properly confronted him about it. My mother has taught me that only strong people forgive, so anytime I try to talk to her about it, she shuts me down, she doesn't believe that he traumatized me and she tells me to just toughen up, that's the mentality she raised me with.\n\nThe other issue is that my brother is very VERY violent. If I tell his girlfriend and ruin his reputation he can absolutely physically harm me and more. He knows where I live, where I study and where I work. My family will also find out I \"betrayed\" him and cut me off which is bad because I still partly rely on them financially.\n\nI'm concerned for his girlfriend but I'm also scared for my own safety, that's why I've never even confronted him about it.  It's a very frustrating position to be in. I oftentimes try to excuse his behaviour due to the fact that we both went through a horrible early childhood and grew up in a violent and drunk household since we were babies.",

Forgiving does not make you strong, especially when he has not asked for forgiveness. \n\nI hope you find your way out of this one day. Please know that sharing blood with someone means nothing if they don\u2019t show you love and respect. You can find your own family find people who love you and support you and leave these people far behind.",

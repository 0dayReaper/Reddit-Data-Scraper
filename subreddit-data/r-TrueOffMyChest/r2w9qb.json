And Everytime I bring it up he claims what he\u2019s doing is unpaid labor similar to that of a homemaker. But he doesn\u2019t clean or cook or do any of that the way he used to. He just monitors his stupid subreddits. I don\u2019t know what to do.\n\n\nSometimes I want to leave him because I believe I may not be able to reach him.",

            "comment": "All.  There has been some misunderstanding as to what is allowed on this subreddit.  I made my standard playful post but didn't sticky it this time (I usually sticky the \"Down with the mods!\" comments I make) but there seems to have been a breach in protocol, so to speak.\n\nWe always allow posts against reddit mods in general (just not specific users to avoid doxxing, unless it's me specifically, then be as savage as you want).  Yes, moderating *is* a thankless, unpaid \"job\".  But that is no excuse for a moderator to be butthurt on the internet just because people don't like them or what they do or think what they do is unimportant.  If we ignore everyone who has something negative to say about us or our subreddit, there would no longer be any room to improve.\n\nIt's the onus of the moderation team to be transparent, accept criticism, demolishing the non-constructive, and evaluating the constructive.  That's how to have the best community possible.  This *requires* us to allow criticism of moderation.  Consequently, the previous post stating that hatred towards moderators will result in a permanent ban is retracted.  Per usual, do not mention specific users and definitely don't tag anyone, but complaints are literally what this subreddit is for.  We, of course, still encourage these posts to be personal in nature.",

Niche genres and styles do not earn money.  Literary writing doesn't earn money.  The competition for publishing is totally nuts in any area.  \n\nSuccessful writers tend to write commercial fiction that is not particularly fun to write.

                    "comment": "&gt; He is not a \"homemaker.\"\n\nSo, here's the difference between a homemaker and a mod.\n\nBoth do work for no pay. But a homemaker *contributes to the household*. A moderator does not, not unless you somehow live inside of a subreddit. \n\nThey don't even contribute to your local community, like you would if you, say spent all your time volunteering for a local food bank or being a volunteer firefighter for no pay. The contribution they make is to a virtual community made of people who are millions of miles away, furthermore a *optional* community dedicated to entertainment.\n\nThat is not to say that moderators are not useful. They are. But they are not useful *to a family*.\n\nOP would have an equal right to be pissed if their husband were spending all of his free time doing unpaid work for a sports team that was based in another country.\n\nEdit: Yes, people have already pointed out that I've been reading too much science fiction and my scale of the Earth is way out of whack. You can stop commenting about it. Not gonna edit it, tho.",

Especially if there's kids involved, but even childfree/childless households, so much time is saved in the evenings by one person doing every task during the workday.\n\nNowadays households almost always need two incomes, but I feel like true homemakers get a bad rap from people like OP's husband who just doesn't want to work.",

I have no idea how people do it with both parents working.\n\n(Childcare is so expensive in my area that something like 90% of Hubby's pay would've gone to childcare, if he stayed working. So when our daughter was born, he quit and started being a full-time homemaker. I am so grateful for him.)",

    "postText": "I have a friend that had 4 cats and was trying to rehome a couple of them. I didn't have any pets and was thinking of getting one so I decided to take it in.\n\nThe first couple days it just hide, but I more or less expected that. The second night it was there I managed to get it out of hiding and chilled with it on the couch for a while before it hid again. Woke up today and couldn't find him again so I just assumed it was hiding real good.\n\nGot back from work an hour ago. Looked again, no food eaten, water drink, litter box unused and no sign of waste anywhere. I can't think of anytime he would have had the opportunity to escape, but I also can't think of anyplace I haven't already checked at least a few times.\n\nI feel bad as my friend trusted me to look after this cat and i have no clue where it went.",

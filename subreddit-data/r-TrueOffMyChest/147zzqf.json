And I\u2019m certain that anyone who reads what you wrote is very proud of you.\n\nMy dad passed by suicide, nobody knew what he was going through and he never told anyone how he felt. You just coming to this subreddit and saying how you feel goes a long way and for some people can lift a weight off their shoulders when they\u2019re trying to hold it in because they don\u2019t want to make others upset, and you\u2019re genuinely a brave person for being clear about how you\u2019ve been feeling. That doesn\u2019t make you weak.",

The fact that you keep bringing up no one cares sounds like you wanna do it for attention. \n\nPlease, no one\u2019s attention is worth you taking your life. You need to be around for your mom and to create a life for yourself. I think you\u2019re good. Maybe you should read the book \u201cthe courage to be disliked\u201d \n\nAs you get older. You\u2019d realize external validation isn\u2019t worth a penny. Live for yourself and the lady who brought you to this world and who loves you more than anything else in the world",

(I\u2019m selfish and self-centered that way)\n\nI can point out that most survivors of suicide report regretting it. (The ultimate post-nut clarity)\n\nI can tell you that there are several recourses such as suicide prevention numbers ([suicide prevention numbers by county](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines)) \n\nI can tell you that you\u2019re brave and strong and that everything will be alright, but I\u2019m a stranger on the internet and easily dismissed.\n\nI can tell you to get therapy, but that\u2019s expensive and time consuming. \n\nBut all that being said, I hope that you don\u2019t do it, and if you\u2019d like, message me.

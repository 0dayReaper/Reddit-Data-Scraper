    "postText": "it's not like it happens regularly, in fact a good majority of the time everything's fine and our friendship is great. but then there's the days he's got some kinda hangout planned with them, it's usually online because of scheduling and what have you. i genuinely have no problem with it, when we talk after he's had some friend time elsewhere he tells funny stories of what they got up to. we'll crack jokes and laugh and i'll tell him i'm glad he had a good time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe problem is only that he will completely and utterly ignore me when he's with them in anyway, he'll ignore my calls and leave me on read for hours if not entire days if he has plans with them. it'd be fine if he'd let me know, but it's always a surprise to me when my best friend is active but not responding to me. i don't mind him being with them, that's not even an issue. his friends are fun and talented, they're all artists so they draw together a lot. it's just solely the ignoring me that bugs me, but he knows about that ! i've told him clearly before that i'd rather be told \"no, can't hangout i'm busy with XYZ\", like that would give me ease. i'd know he's just busy and leave him alone. but instead he ignores my messages, so i give him space so i don't bother him. then days pass with nothing so i try again and THEN he tells me he was busy with them for a while. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nit's also conveniently always when i'm going through something rough in my own day-to-day. i don't think it's on purpose on his end at all, i know if he knew he'd be there. but i think the universe is just fucked up and times things to go wrong exactly when he busies himself with his friends. i don't spam him or anything while he's with them, i think at most i'll send 3-4 messages when he's active but not responding, then i just stop bc my (admittedly overly-anxious) brain worries he's mad at me. this will go on for days at a time until i finally work up the courage to message him again and make sure he's okay. it's this cycle that left me constantly worried until i finally picked up on the pattern to know what was happening.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\neven worse is now i worry he ignores them for me too, like that we're the back ups when each other are busy. i'd hate it so much if his other friends were left feeling the way i do because he's ignoring them to talk with me. i have zero evidence to believe this is the case, so i hope not. can't help but worry, though.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni think i've just become hyper aware of it because it's conveniently when i'm doing awful. i'm stressed and tired and sad, and really all i want is to talk with my bff. if he were to message me right now to ask how i'm doing i'd feel so much better. but i'm tired of being the one to reach out when he does this, so i'm not gonna message him first. i won't ignore him, if he finally reaches out to me i'll respond. i don't want to make him feel bad, i have a hunch he isn't even aware he does it. but it still hurts and i'm not in a place to be his back-up entertainment after he's done with them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni'm not here for advice on what to do tbh, i just wanted to vent. he's still my bff and we have so much fun the rest of the time, i trust him completely. today was just rough and it was like things stacking on each other and i hit a breaking point when i began tearing up missing him again. i have no one else to talk to to get it off my chest so this was my best bet. thanks for reading and i hope you have a great day",

I do a quick count based on rows of 10 to see how many i have in total, then I race to the self checkout and i just start scanning one box over and over and over until i get to the amount i actually have. \n\nManagement at my local winn dixie has become wise to my ways, and will often send out one of their goons to tell me \u201cthere\u2019s a limit to how many of those you can purchase sir\u201d and \u201cwe told you this last time sir please stop\u201d but i just keep on trucking goddamnit! I scan and scan until i\u2019m fucking done, they can\u2019t stop me i\u2019m a fucking jimmy dean breakfast machine! Thank god for touch to pay, because by the time i\u2019m done with my legal and rightful american transaction the cops are already in the store as always lookin for the JIMMY DEAN EXPRESS but it\u2019s already PULLIN OUT OF STATION MOTHERFUCKER. \n\nI\u2019m stopping in front of those automatic doors waiting for my han solo moment to shoot right through the gap and fucking destroy the death star that is my hunger! THEY CANT STOP ME IN THE PARKING LOT, i\u2019m riding that motherfucking cart like a skateboard standing on the back end of it, pushing down to my car where i go hand to fist, blood sweat and tears shoveling that shit into the trunk of my Ford Explorer in less than 10 seconds tops! I don\u2019t need bags, i just need JIMMY DEAN!!! \n\nI\u2019m pulling out and everyone\u2019s standing and watching, admiring the master crafting his magnum goddamn opus. They can\u2019t stop me, and they\u2019ll never stop me. I eat jimmy dean breakfast bowls for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! It\u2019s true, i defy the word of the gods and enjoy it for every meal. All these assholes at work question it, some even beg me to stop. But i tell them GODDAMNIT THESE PRESERVATIVES ARE GONNA MAKE ME IMMORTAL AND THE FLAVOR IS A ONE WAY TRIP TO HEAVEN! They don\u2019t fucking get it, they never will, they never tried to live life like i do, nobody does,  nobody understands THEY JUST JUDGE ME but they can\u2019t see how beautiful this light is at the end of the jimmy dean tunnel\n\n I JUST WANT PEOPLE TO FUCKING UNDERSTAND HOW BEAUTIFUL JIMMY DEAN BREAKFAST BOWLS ARE\n\nAlso here\u2019s my ranking of jimmy dean bowls in order of best to last\n\n\t\u25e6\tSteak and eggs\n\t\u25e6\tSausage and gravy\n\t\u25e6\tMeat lovers\n\t\u25e6\tLoaded potato\n\t\u25e6\tBiscuit and gravy \n\t\u25e6\tDelights farmhouse breakfast bowl\n\t\u25e6\tSausage\n\t\u25e6\tBacon\n\t\u25e6\tDelights turkey sausage\n\t\u25e6\tDelights sweet potato and spinach with turkey sausage\n\t\u25e6\tSalsa verde\n\nThank you have a wonderful night \n\nEdit: i just wanted to say i\u2019m actually at a bit of a low point right now with my office closing down and having no success finding a new job so far so i\u2019m glad i made so many people happy with MY BURNING DESIRE FOR THE SODIUM-LADEN GLORY THAT IS JIMMY DEAN BREAKFAST BOWLS GODDAMNIT I LOVE THEM SO MUCH",

How, you may ask?\n\nI MAKE MY OWN AT HOME NOW. They're even BETTER.\n\n* Oil up a pan and put over medium heat, preferably a pan with a lid\n* Chop up some potatoes, season to taste, cover, stir every 3 or so minutes. (I prefer either Russet or Gold potatoes, but any will do)\n* Cook potatoes to preference. It takes me like 15 or so minutes, or until most of what I see is golden brown or darker. They'll also soften up a bit because you cover them, so you know they're done if they're soft enough to split or crush with your stirring apparatus. \n* Scramble some eggs (I use egg whites).\n* Cook some sausage (I still use Jimmy Dean so I guess I haven't kicked the habit completely)\n* Add whatever else you want, but I consider the above to be the base, and most of the time I'll eat just that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThanks for this post. I'm making me one of these for breakfast now.",

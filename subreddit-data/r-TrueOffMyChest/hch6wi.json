    "postText": "I've always been a $40k/yr guy.  No education. We've been married 20 years. 2017, I landed a mediocre job that paid $70/k do to oil industry shit that I'll never understand.\n\nI told her it would be short lived.\n\n2019, we buy a house.\n\n2020, I lose the job. I collect unemployment for a month, then go to work in a warehouse for $15/hr. She gets a job there to at the same wage.\n\nSweet. Both of us combined make what I used to make. We'll be fine. She says it's fine cause she'll do anything to keep the house.\n\nAfter a week, she decides she can't handle working 40 hours a week, so she makes this...  post.. on Facebook talking down on me for not doing enough for my family after she quits the job.\n\nI wanted to reply, but don't wanna be \"that guy\" on Facebook, so I blocked her.\n\nI'm ranting right now, cause I'm drunk and thinking of just walking away.\n\nI feel like she's totally in the wrong for being too lazy to work a 40 hour week.\n\nShe thinks she does enough at home...\n\nNormally, I would agree, but she doesn't do shit. The house is trashed when I get home. She's usually stoned and drunk and doesn't even know where our 9 year old daughter is.\n\n\"She's at the neighbor kids house\" is her usual response..\n\nI just wanna leave this bitch but don't know how.\n\nThanks for listening Reddit.",

She shouldn\u2019t put you down when you support her and your family while she does nothing, especially on social media! It doesn\u2019t sound like she will do anything for the house, it sounds like she will do anything for herself.",

They had her in jail for a few weeks for an unrelated reason and let her out, told her to be at court in n a specific date for a child support hearing, to which she never showed. After checking up on the case, I learned that no warrant was issued for her not appearing, and they are trying to locate her to get information on where she lives to send her more mail. \nI gave the worker the address to the place she is staying(with her mom), they tell me they will add it to the system. A few weeks later, they start sending mail meant for the mother to my address. I asked them to remove my address for the sake of mail not meant for me and they refused. \n\nIt\u2019s all such a clusterfuck here.",

Anywhoodly, she\u2019s a meth addict &amp; a pill popper &amp; to make an incredibly long story short, she\u2019s been abusive to both boys pretty much their whole lives, mentally &amp; physically, and there have been NINE DFCS cases called against her, she\u2019s violated TPO\u2019s 4 times, and so much more, but the courts JUST IN FEBRUARY, granted \u201csupervised visitation\u201d. I\u2019m not complaining because at least it\u2019s something, but neither of the boys wanna be around her. I\u2019ve been here since they were 2 and 7 &amp; they\u2019re 8 and 13 now &amp; those boys are my whole world. I don\u2019t know how any mother could do such awful things to her children, but what pisses me off the most is how fucked up the courts are when it comes to dead beat, abusive mothers. It took almost SIX YEARS of the most painful nights, holding those boys while they screamed from their nightmares replaying her abuse, six fucking years, while I bandaged wounds she caused to those boys. One of those times she cut the oldest ON PURPOSE with a kitchen knife because he made his little brother mad...and the police, the judges, the DFCS workers, did NOTHING! So, no...the courts don\u2019t give a fuck about what\u2019s going on unless you have solid evidence of neglect, abuse, addiction, etc. and even if you do, they still don\u2019t care. And also, idk how it is everywhere else, but in my state, even a sole custody parent is required, MANDATED, to receive child support for at least one year. I went through that in my divorce before I met my current husband. I didn\u2019t want a dime of his money, but my atty told me I didn\u2019t have a choice but to calculate it &amp; put it in the papers, whether he paid it or not, it HAD to be in the papers. \n\nI\u2019d also like to add, which I can\u2019t stand that I feel like I have to, but in the 6 years I\u2019ve been with my husband, I\u2019ve had so many people tell me that I\u2019m \u201ctoo involved\u201d with my bonus boys. Actual medical professionals said that to my face because I had to bring the boys to their regular check ups because their dad was working &amp; their mom was binging &amp; no one could get in touch with her. I\u2019ve had people tell me I needed to back off and stop trying to be a bonus parent to them because they \u201chave two parents\u201d. The list goes on. But, I\u2019m not a \u201creplacement mom\u201d, I\u2019m not a \u201cbitter wife\u201d, and I\u2019m not an \u201cevil stepmother\u201d. I\u2019ve never wanted anything other than all of us, my husband, myself, his ex, and her husband, to be able to co-parent and get along for these boys. I\u2019ve never wanted anything so badly in my 6 years of being a bonus mom other than for their mom to get the help she so desperately needs and refuses to acknowledge. I grew up with an absent father and an addict/abusive mother &amp; I went through 100% of the same abuse that these boys have been through. So, even though no one has called me out on reddit anytime I\u2019ve shared this, (it\u2019s only been a couple of times) I still always want everyone to know where my heart is &amp; where my mind is. When it comes to those boys, I\u2019d give anything in the world for their mom to get clean, get back on her meds, and be the best mom those boys could ever ask for.",

Obviously police are useless, but they generally take assault with a deadly weapon and potential attempted murder seriously.",

They even had to do a forensic interview that my neither my husband, nor I, could take them to. We had to have a family friend take them &amp; the report from that was \u201cinconclusive\u201d. It might help to add (and this is incredibly hard to hear) that the oldest changed his story to DFCS the FIRST time they were called because their mother told him that if he didn\u2019t tell the caseworker he made it all up, she was going to force him to watch her slit his little brother\u2019s throat &amp; bury him in their grandparents back yard &amp; then she\u2019d do the same to him. He was SEVEN...what seven year old wouldn\u2019t change their story?! Unfortunately, after that, for some reason he was considered \u201ca non credible witness\u201d and they closed that case. So, after that, my husband tried to get a restraining order against her &amp; the judge literally laughed at him &amp; told him to leave. We didn\u2019t actually get restraining orders until she entered my car, tried to yank their youngest out of my car while he was sleeping, and in the struggle (he was belted in his booster seat, she punched my youngest daughter who was two at the time. I knew she didn\u2019t mean to, but if she\u2019d just kept her ass in her car until he woke up, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. She hit me twice &amp; although I\u2019m not proud of it, I hit her back. A lot. Neither of the kids saw anything, but there were witnesses outside who saw it all &amp; even though I didn\u2019t wanna press charges, they arrested her &amp; we were able to get the TPO\u2019s then. She violated those over &amp; over again, in more ways than one, and was arrested for one of the times, but not for the others. We\u2019ve had nine, maybe 10, DFCS caseworkers and the last three times they were called, their \u201csupervisor\u201d, who we found out was a friend of the mom\u2019s grandparents, personally told my husband &amp; I, and the other caseworkers told us, that if they got another call, they\u2019d remove all four of our children (the boys, my daughter from my previous marriage, AND our daughter together) from our home &amp; investigate my husband &amp; I on the grounds of neglect because we knew about the abuse but continued to send them to her for visitations. BUT, the caseworkers told us to let them go as to not throw up red flags. So, in 2017, my husband stopped allowing them to go to her house &amp; started taking them to their grandparents so they could keep an eye on things, but she stopped coming because they wouldn\u2019t let her be alone with the boys (it\u2019s a weird but awesome dynamic bc the boys great grandparents are her grandparents &amp; their grandad is her dad, but we are very close with them &amp; they don\u2019t support or agree with her actions. They knew my husband when he was little &amp; they\u2019ve been like grandparents to him his whole life, so he trusts them &amp; for good reason.) since they knew what she was doing &amp; then came the every weekend calls from the \u201cofficers attempting to find out what was going on &amp; why he was keeping the children from their mom\u201d...literally 12 of those calls &amp; about 20 CAD reports from the E-911 center. Basically, she was showing the cops the \u201cparenting plan\u201d which is a breakdown of the final court order (I\u2019m sure you already know this. Lol) specifying which holidays she has on which year &amp; vice versa, and who makes the religious, educational, medical decisions, but it doesn\u2019t say who has primary physical custody, so there were two times (the first two officer calls) that they were attempting to meet with my husband so they could arrest him for going against the custody order. But we all know \u201ccops don\u2019t deal with civil matters\u201d my ass...anyways, there have been so many times that my husband has seriously contemplated just leaving the state &amp; never letting her find us, but I can\u2019t do that. As horrible as she is, I still hope that one day she realizes how much she\u2019s missed and how much pain she\u2019s caused &amp; tries to re-establish a relationship with them. If I\u2019m being 100% honest, I don\u2019t feel as strongly about that as I used to, but I promised the oldest that I\u2019d always keep my hope as long as he did, and I can\u2019t let him down. \ud83d\ude14",

When my ex &amp; I got divorced, his parents paid a caseworker to implement a safety plan against me because I was supposedly a heavy drug user, passed all my drug tests (blood, urine, and hair follicle) then when all was said &amp; done, my ex was in RTU for crack. When the divorce was finalized, unfortunately my sister in law lost a child in utero 3 weeks before her due date &amp; it was a huge wake up call for my ex &amp; his family. Now, thank the goddesses, my ex in-laws &amp; I have have a great relationship &amp; they adore all of my kids, blood or not, they hung the moon in their eyes. I never EVER thought, after my experience with DFCS, that it could get worse, but lord, was I wrong. In that same sense, though, I\u2019m grateful for my experience because it helped me to be able to help the boys &amp; my husband understand what we were facing. Now that I\u2019m in my 30\u2019s &amp; have read up on so many children who have died at the hands of DFCS, my heart breaks for them &amp; my head is just clouded with emotions every time I hear of another case of DFCS injustice knowing those children were supposed to be in \u201cgood hands\u201d, but they weren\u2019t. It\u2019s just hard to know but not be able to do anything about it.",

People genuinely want to believe that courts are equally fair to both sexes at best, shitty to women at worst. They don't want to believe that the treatment of men and women is...different. Courts are stuck in the traditional mindset that women are natural mothers, made to fuck, reproduce, and nurture children. This means they're less likely to prosecute rape in many circumstances, and also less likely to deprive women of the right of motherhood, even if everyone else will suffer for it. If courts just treated women like humans, then everything would be better.",

But understand that the courts are being advised by psychologists &amp; social workers. The same people they presently want to replace police forces with. But that's an issue for another day.\n\n   \nI will tell you a story from a long time ago. There was a famous child abuse case in NYC 25 years ago where a little girl died. It brought to light severe neglect &amp; child abuse, as well as domestic violence. This shined a light on social services. So there was another social worker  on another case who was spoken to. She was from another country near So. America. She also had an extreme case. They asked her why she didn't report the abuse she had seen, and she replied \"I didn't think it was that bad. Back in my home country children have it worse.\" Imagine that. So even though she had American Guidelines this is the judgement she made.   \n\n\nAnd this is what we deal with in the courts.",

She had three kids, then took on three step kids, and just recently another bonus kid who is friends with her second oldest. Her step kids mother consistently would do things like \"forget\" to give the kids medication when she had them (which eventually lead to the realization the youngest had an ear infection for over a year because my sister trusted their mom to give him his antibiotics) and have the oldest (who was 8 at the time) babysit the younger two while she spent a few hours fucking her new boy toy. And that was all on the rare days she didn't pawn them off on her parents. The oldest is 16 now and they've had full custody for a few years. The kids still visit her but they see her more as a troubled friend than a mom. My sister is the most stable mom they've ever had (She's known them all since birth). So fuck anyone and everyone who says \"you're too involved.\" By blood or not, they're your kids and there's no such thing as a kid that has too many people caring for them.",

What I told them. How hard I tried to coparent.\n\nIf she decided she wouldn't coparent and she made some damaging decision without discussing them with me.

This is not a concept people typically forget. \n\n&gt;She seems a bit spoiled to be honest with you.\n\nShe's publicly talking shit about her own husband of  20 years  and father of her children on FB and you really felt the need to qualify that with \"a bit\"? What would it take for her to just be spoiled?\n\n&gt;Marriage is a partnership and you have to work with each other and not against one another to achieve goals and be happy.\n\nWhich ones does publicly shit talking your partner fall under again? And what about working hard to provide for your family for 2 decades?",

                            "comment": "You know, I knew a guy once that bought a beautiful, dream house for his family. They were so happy when they moved in. Unfortunately, shortly after, some tensions started to rise. Little problems and issues started popping up around the house. They were having behavioral problems with their daughter. They found holes in the floor, and in the daughters closet, and had no idea where they came from(they weren't there when they moved in. Maybe shoddy building materials?). Anyway, they had a lovely daughter. I believe her name was Carol, or Coraline, or something like that. She was such a sweet girl, but at her age, she started to devolop some behavioral problems. She started to become aloof, talked of imaginary friends all the time. Started to develop sleeping issues, and was completely absorbed with her television(you know kids). It was so bad, even when nothing was on, she would happily just watch static over interacting with the family anymore. \n\nSo anyway, my friend finally decided he should spend some money looking into renovating the house to hopefully fix some of these issues. \n\nAfter wasting a lot of money hiring these quacks that just took over, disrupted the house, set up a bunch of weird equipment that took up the whole damn living room(I even caught one of them filming the house and rooms of the family members. Can you say creepy?) They stayed up at all hours of the night, charged a fortune, and still couldn't fix any of the problems. \n\nSo he decided to try and look into the town history, and discovered his new home was built on top of a damn old cemetery! And nobody bothered to mention this? Ridiculous. Anyway, after discovering this, he was greatly concerned. Everyone knows the soil of an old graveyard is very unstable from being repeatedly dug up and filled back in over and over. \n\nWhile looking for options, it was suggested to call this little old lady. He was of course skeptical at first. I mean, a little old lady being a master at fixing the issues with a home? But he decided to give her a call anyway. She ended up being great though, and of course, this little old lady (cute as can be, but she knew her stuff), figured out that yes, his problem was indeed where the home was built, and had completely destroyed the foundation. \n\nBelieve it or not, when the ground finally collapsed due to the weight of the home, actual human skeletons from the graves (Trivia: he later he found out they were american indian skeletons), actually started floating up in his swimming pool (yes, it totally freaked him out at the time). \n\nSo anyway, the foundation had failed so badly, the house basically just sank and disappeared. And even though it was their dream home, they made the decision to move out that very night, and just take the loss on the home(insurance wouldn't pay out. Something about \"unexplained occurrences aren't covered\" bs. Typical insurance company). \n\nSo they did leave. Unfortunately I heard that lovely little old woman that helped them through the process did eventually die, but they found a new home, moved, and although the little girl continued to have some issues(sad story for another day), they never did regret leaving behind their dream home......but I guess you would've just said \"DONT LEAVE THE HOME!.\n\nEdit:spelling/punctuation",

There is always the risk of an abusive partner running off with the child, especially if they experience high stressors, like a job loss, divorce or addiction. Police will not do anything in that situation unless there is a custody agreement outlining who the primary custodian is and the county of residence for the child. Their reasoning is that since the abusive parent is still a parent of the child, them taking them isn't kidnapping unless the court says otherwise. It's a shitty system that puts way too many children at risk for kidnapping by an abusive parent.\n\nEdit: Not saying your wife is this way, but you're better safe than sorry.

The situation with your kid is the emergency here.\n\nThe fact that you\u2019re drunk right now doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019re an alcoholic.

I've watched it happen real-time. It's basically when two trashy adults find love. The personality type is exhausting though: venting personal information online, texting friends or family about problems in their personal relationship, no trust, no mutual partnership. \n\nIt's so weird, too, because they don't understand that if they just starting being open and honest, they'd be fine. But instead they just pull each other down. His wife isn't actually wanting to shit on him, I think. I think she actually wants to say is \"I didn't like working there, I didn't want to sacrifice our home, but I couldn't handle the job. And now I'm afraid my decision is going to cost us our home.\" And OP really wanted was a partner that could handle an equivalent amount of work. But he doesn't have that partner. He has her. And that's the choice he made. So he should be working with her to help her find a job she *can* handle and can help pay their bills. Instead of talking and working together, they'll bicker, bitch, moan and post stuff on the internet. It's times like this I'm so happy I have the person I do in my life. To be honest, I'm more of the \"trashy\" person in my relationship, but at least I can take a step back and logically assess the situation and offer some sort of insights that allows us to continue on happily. But OP will most likely just do what every trashy couple does when they want to solve a problem: one of them concedes miserably. And so either OP will convince his wife to work in a job she hates to afford the house they want or OP will be double-timing it to make a living while his wife chills out at home. \n\nThese people are fools. They could have a happy arrangement if they just understood each other's flaws and knew how to work with them instead of against them.  OPs wife maybe isn't cut out for that kind of work. Well, fine. Find different work. Don't just cut down your hours. Maybe in her off hours she could do gigs that she likes. They just need to lay the cards on the table. Talk about their strengths and their weaknesses and plan together. \n\nThey'll never be partners until they can work together. It's a fucking three legged race in relationships and you can't do that shit unless you start out in tandem. Sounds like they don't know how to walk let alone run.",

People are so quick to judge the wife when we don't know the true scope, only tidbits, and the tidbits were from an upset, drunk man. (Not victim blaming, because they both could be the victim, I can't tell cause Idk her side of the story) So obviously the post is already gonna be bias. \n\nAnytime there is a relationship post, everyone is quick to throw words like \"LEAVE!\" \"DIVORCE!\" \"LAWYER UP!\". Sometimes people just need to rant. Including the wife. Not saying what she posted on facebook was nice, but everyone has their outbursts. They obviously agreed that she'd be housewife and shit hit the fan when they bought a house (OP maybe wanted the house since he's the bread winner and convinced wife to get it, it's vaguely mentioned why they even bought a house, besides having a bigger paycheck, so maybe it was OPs idea to begin with, Which the HOUSE is the biggest stress causer atm, yet the buying of the house was barely touched on). Maybe it's the stress of buyers regret that's triggering her. Either way both can't afford the home without each other. The needing to keep the home is the solution they need to work towards because that's the wedge in their relationship now. \n\nAll I know is there is another side to this story, like almost every damn relationship posts on reddit, I almost always try to see it both ways and either way, the best advice I can give OP is to communicate, soberly. I'm sure after 20 years they can at least communicate in some well manner. If they can't then OP will know when it's time to divorce. Strangers on the internet shouldn't be telling him too.\n\nEdit: wording and spacing.",

We have been divorced for some time now. \n\nIn hindsight what I should have done is:\n\n* confront my own behaviors and thoughts as well as my perception of hers. Articulate them; either to myself or a counselor/therapist. I checked out so thoroughly that it wasnt until well into the divorce process and a lot of counseling that I was able to do that. Sure, I had plenty of monkeys in that circus, but I was also ignoring her behaviors and how they affected me. \n* Decide if you want to salvage or restore your relationship. again a professional is a big help. There is nothing unmanly about seeing a pro to help get your head straight. I was fortunate in that the first one I went to was an outstanding woman who didnt let me weasel and helped me sort my head. \n* If you do want to salvage it, get into a marriage counselor. But dont let it go as I did. In my case we covered her complaints but when it came to my turn later on, well suddenly she couldnt be bothered to go. Dig in. Its going to be painful. And it may not result in a renewed marriage. \n* If you decide you have had enough - then go research the divorce process in your state and get going on that. \n\n\ntl;dr:\n\nGet your head straight before you choose an action.

I\u2019d also consider doing some form of online education. You do not need a college degree to make a living; however, you do need to be competent in a field. Try reading more in your free time, whether it be some manuals or educational texts. Best of luck.",

Is she really like that all the time, or are you just talking shit lol. \n\nIn a few hours when you wake up, when you check Facebook and Reddit and all social media, panicking because you are hoping you didn't say anything stupid or embarrassing if so, praying not too many people saw it before you can take it down.  \n\nOn the other hand, in the event you are seriously venting, how long has she been drinking and smoking like this, and have you guys been having problems for a long time or is this something recent?  Maybe she is more worried about your finances than you thought, or maybe it's both of you stressing. But your rant did sound like drunk talk, and this is coming from an alcoholic (sober since 2014). Man, waking up to that blackout and anxiety wondering wtf did I do or say or post ... \ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude35\ud83d\ude35\n\nAnyway, hope things get better for you!",

Possibly with a professional. 20 years is a loong time and if communication has been shit for a while there is probably a lot more going on in both of your minds. \n\nYeah she did a jerk off thing but maybe she felt like it was the only way for her to be heard? Who knows. People can be weird. Just sober up, and talk to her about maybe going to couple/marriage counseling. It's not for \"bad couples\" it's to help strengthen what is already there and air out things that felt like they couldn't before.",

The question is, outside of this one instance does your wife treat you fairly well?\n\nAlso, you need to boost your self esteem a bit, I\u2019m sure you are a little worn out because of everything.\n\n1.  Stop drinking completely , after about a month you will be amazing at how great you feel.\n\n2.  Update your resume, whatever experiences you had that were unique to that 70K job probably relate to multiple industries and you could definitely find something.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with sending out resumes and looking for a job while still working your current one.  There is nothing wrong with making $15/hr but if you can make more with your experience then you should.  Jim Rohn said, \u201cyou are not paid by the hour but by the value that you bring to the hour\u201d.\n\n3.  Write down your monthly expenses and get a plan together for spending.  It won\u2019t make the problems go away but at least you will have a plan which will make you feel a lot better.\n\n4.  Spend as much time as you can with your kid.  Fishing, hunting, gaming or even going for walks.  Especially when you are stressed out.  Children have a way of making you remember being young before the world was on your shoulders which is a great way to reset when you are frustrated.\n\n5.  Your wife is an adult, part of being an adult is making difficult decisions.\n\n6.  Invest in yourself, find a hobby that makes your more valuable.  Read books on leadership, teamwork and motivation.  Get training or take night classes which can make a difference on resumes.",

Worked full time often with OT, worked w jobs for a couple years while she stayed home and took \"care\"of the house. Except I'd come home and have to cook, clean, do laundry so she could go upstairs and sleep, because she was worn out.    Been divorced for 5ish or so years now, I have the house, the kids, and my credit score increased.  Lol. Plus my mental state is significantly better.",

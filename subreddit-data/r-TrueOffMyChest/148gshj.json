    "postText": "im a groomsman for my friends wedding. I befriended him when i met my Fiance, who is the BFF of the bride.\n\nim the odd one out of the groomsman, all other grew up together. im also older at 26yo than the rest at 22-23yo.\n\n**planning the bachelor party was like being in a group project with people from school who never did their part.**\n\nno one wanted to do any planning, let the mere idea of a \"plan\" was over their head, and clearly something they weren't used to.\n\ntherefore, the plan was \"nashville\"... nothing more. the only thing we needed was an airbnb.\n\nat this point, since his first \"2 best men\" were dropping the ball since it was there job to find one, he came to me and complained about it. so i stepped up. immediately that day, i nailed down what HE wanted, and found several and had him choose. **DONE.**\n\nNow it was the best mans job to book it and collect the money for it.\n\n&gt; \"hey OP, so [best man] doesn't really wanna do it and was wanted you to do it\"\n\n**fuck it fine. DONE. after a painful 2 weeks of trying to get people to pay me back that i dont know**\n\n\nas the party approached, i knew there was still no other planning. \n\nI reached out to the groom with several suggestions:\n\n&gt; hey this white rafting looks fun.... wanna eat here on the trip down for lunch.... how about reservations here on friday\n\nbut that was too much planning for the groom and he kinda dismissed it.\n\n**fine. no plan it is**\n\n---\n\nfinally arrived.\n\n6 people 5 beds (no additional couch). the airbnb said they had a extra cot but didn't. \n\n- one friend didn't pay at all (he took the grooms dads place who couldn't go but paid)\n- one other friend didn't pay at all\n- i booked the place and then paid for myself &amp; the groom (since someone should pay for him as tradition)\n\n\n**i got the shit end** and had to sleep on the hardwood floor. everyone else got a bed. \n\n\n---\n\nwhen it came time for planning anything, the groom was complaining. we wasted so much time walking/driving around.\n\nI made rafting reservations, but the groom told me to cancel them because it was too early in the morning.\n\nthat next morning, he wanted to do them, and then proceeded to complain about \"not having reservations\".\n\n\n---\n\nthey proceeded to throw fireworks into the woods and have them go off. when i yelled at them to stop being idiots and cut it out before they start a fire, they jumping down my throat for having a stick up my ass\n\n---\n\nwhen the plan was \"no one drive. all uber. we are too drunk\" and then they decided to drive, i questioned it and asked \"are you safe to drive, you've been drinking\"... again, jumped down my throat for having a stick up my ass\n\n---\n\nmuch more other stuff, but just needed to rant and get it off my chest....",

The optimist in me thinks there\u2019s still hope, but his fianc\u00e9 would need to be an expert in bullshit intolerance and boundary setting. Drawing from my own past memories of being 22 and female, this skill of hers may not be strong enough yet.\n\nu/ObjectiveDev if you or your fianc\u00e9 were ever to give advice to this bride-to-be if immaturity starts to erode their relationship, rather than crapping on her choice of man I\u2019d focus on building her confidence up and encouraging her to say no to such behaviour. People hesitate to stand up for themselves in fear of losing the relationship but sometimes it\u2019s the only way to save it.",

They tell me they are all crashing at one of their shore houses and are confused as to why I thought they were staying at the hotel. \n\nTrying not to ruin his BP, I quietly tell a few of them what I think of them and otherwise don't rock the boat. One of the other groomsmen ended up paying half of the cost instead of these shit weasels.\n\nMy buddy got divorced and remarried years later.  His second BP was just a BBQ at a friends house (I was his Best Man again, but disnt have to plan anything). A group of these same assholes was invited. \n\nAfterwards we decided to go to a local bar for a few hours and one of his bride's cousins said he would order a couple Uber Blacks to transport everyone. He asked the shit weasels if they needed to Uber and they said yes. Against my advice, he ordered an extra car for them. \n\nAfter he paid (I don't remember how much, but the Uber Blacks were expensive) and the cars arrived, these motherfuckers backed out and decided to drive, even though he said he had already paid.  \n\nThey didnt give a shit, and I called them out in the bar for being such blatant assholes. I dont usually lose my temper, but I almost came to blows with one of them over it (Im getting pissed off recounting this).\n\nThese assholes all have good jobs and bragg about how much money they make (one is a millionaire, another is CFO of a corporation).

And the fact that had you not stepped up and taken charge of the planning/payment, there would have hardly been a party at all.\n\nFor comparison, my brother just got married and his bachelor party was planned collectively. All the groomsmen were in their early 30s/late 20s, and everything went smoothly. Everyone communicated throughout the planning process regarding Airbnb, food, activities, and payment for all of it. We used this app called Splitwise to keep track of all the expenses and everyone paid their fair share.\n\nSorry OP, you got screwed. If I had put in the time and effort that you did and ended up sleeping on a hardwood floor I would\u2019ve been pissed.",

I was in my second week of recovery and balls were being dropped. \n\nI got the massive Airbnb house. I got rental cars. Whitewater reservations and then. I got regulated to sleeping in the bunk bed room. Then after I had bought my plane ticket using my air miles I get a call from the groom. He doesn\u2019t want me there anymore. Not safe to travel post Cancer. Apparently. I\u2019ve never spoken to him again\n\nApparently the best man who ended up not going to the wedding and another close friend who dropped the ball on planning complained I had taken control and they didn\u2019t want me there. \n\nNo idea. Sucks really. I only took over because the Groom asked me too. Nothing was planned. \n\nI sent a wedding gift.  I was still planning on going to the wedding but got an email from his soon to be wife that they didn\u2019t feel comfortable with my traveling.  The wedding was 3 months after my surgery. So I didn\u2019t go to the wedding obviously \n\nJust really sucks. I figured I would have gotten an apology. The other groomsmen apologized. I was told by his wife he was going to call me and apologize. Never happened. \n\nWhat can you do. \n\nJust move on OP. I was bitter for awhile. But they showed their true colours",

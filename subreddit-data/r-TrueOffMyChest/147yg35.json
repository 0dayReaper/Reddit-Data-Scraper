    "postText": "Tesla called me back for an interview for an internship. Most people would be like \"YOO that's crazy congrats kick ass\" or at least appreciate the achievement of how hard it is to get those really nice companies to respond. They usually all ghost you. \n\nBut when you send it to parents they're just like okay? Don't screw this one up. Don't forget to practice. \n\nThey don't care what company it is. They don't really get it. \n\nBut it's okay because it's also a blessing that they view life like that because it means they're happy with whatever job you get. You could be working at the #1 company in the world or the #2000 but they'd be like yes this is my child who works so hard and works so well. They'd be proud no matter what. \n\nToday is just one of those days where the sad ones feel a bit more isolating than others. And I wanted to share that Tesla thought I was worth their time as a student in a pile of hundreds of applicants. After surviving trafficking during college I never thought I would be worth anyone's time to begin with. I had little faith in myself as a student so this took me by surprise. I wish I could share this with my parents in the same joy that I am experiencing but I know it won't ever happen, hence the sad isolating feeling.",

Also, thanks for this post. My husband and I are living in another country (different continent) and we\u2019re thinking about settling around here, so your post got me thinking if we ever become an immigrant, I hope I can integrate well that my son won\u2019t feel isolated.",

If you moved there and speak the language you're probably going to integrate just fine. \n\nFor context, my parents and I moved as a family so they spent 40+ years in our home country before we moved. So, I imagine it's much much harder than I can ever imagine (yet) to integrate into a new society. \n\nBut, I'm glad I was able to give you that perspective! And thank you so much!!",

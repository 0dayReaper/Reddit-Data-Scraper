I\u2019m just scared and I\u2019m already \u201cfragile\u201d as is. I don\u2019t think I could take a break up. I have big problems with anxiety and depression. It will snowball very fast starting with seeing a cute girl out in public getting anxious cause I don\u2019t think I look good and then get sad because I\u2019m too scared to ever talk to someone. I just want to hold someone love someone be someone\u2019s",

You can always tip toe on any new relationship until you are certain and then again, nothing is for granted...its just what it is and we as people strive to make the right choices thinking long term. There are people over 30 with no previous partners, so dont worry, there will be men that will try to get your attention..its up to you to decide which you would allow near you.",

If you're feeling scared and fragile, maybe stop pressuring yourself to conform to what you think your \"society's\" expectations are. Also, you may find that what you think \"love\" is at this stage of your life is anything but. And on a physiological level your brain is still developing and your thoughts, feelings, and outlook at your age will most likely be completely different at age 24. Please give yourself time and grace.",

Not just lies but self fulfilling prophecies. Since as you said you aren\u2019t unattractive, the best thing you can do as act as normal and platonic as possible from my experience lol. \n\nDid you know? Your usual jokes &amp; demeanor that you\u2019ve had literal years to practice is actually usually pretty attractive. Since you\u2019re romantically inexperienced, I\u2019d be willing to bet your rizz is only so-so. That\u2019s something that happens only with practice usually. So just make it fun, communicate well, and just hang out with women as if they were your friends. It will dispel whatever aspect of your self conception is holding you back pretty quick. Good luck man.",

            "comment": "In addition to what goose_tooth_ said, is there anyone you trust enough to talk things through with when you go out with someone? That helps in the situation of getting a little advice for the next step. \n\nFirst dates, try something easy without too much of a commitment, like coffee, etc. Committing to something like a movie and dinner is a lot. Plus, if the restaurant is loud, you can\u2019t really talk and then you can\u2019t talk at the movie. By the end of the date, you may not know too much more about your date than you did at the beginning. \n\nGoing slow is not a bad idea. If someone truly wants to get to know you, they don\u2019t mind talking, going on dates and just seeing where things go.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable or pressured by anyone, trust me, I know girls can do it too, or if something just doesn\u2019t feel right, trust your gut, not the anxiety, your gut. I have anxiety as well, and I have faith you will be able to tell the difference.",

    "postText": "\rWhy do the wounds leave the memory so quickly? Why did I think they are sweet marks? I imbibed on the swollen lip and a smile snuck on my face. Why did I think that if I get hit more often, only then will I learn how to differentiate between what is acceptable and what is deadly? Am I my only parasite, feeding those who agreed to take what I have? I\u2019m an altruistic parasite. \n\n\r  \n Seems like my own mental bandwidth is the limit. My attention circles more to what I need to attend for others than it does to me. I lucid dream about the things I know I should have been celebrated for. In those lucid dreams, nobody can withstand the shine I possess. Maybe I\u2019m a bully who struggles to see others shine alongside me. Those manners of mine are part of the reason all the masses would tune in to my channel\u2026 to celebrate the victories I have despite how much the punishment should be. There, I don\u2019t get punished unless I surrender and admit my pride when the truth comes into my ear. So, yes, the mental bandwidth is the limit.\n\n\r  \nI can\u2019t breathe. The truth will hurt me. Okay. I prefer to breathe, instead of dying by holding onto lies. I can\u2019t let them close. I just might let them convince me to take on a new form of beatings\u2026 Self-beating. I slept in the dark room because I didn\u2019t want to sacrifice my comfort for a new experience: I was going to have a room all to myself. \n\n\r  \nNow I\u2019m too comfortable in the dark. I need light. Those self-beatings weren\u2019t always the best method. Holding my breath wasn\u2019t going to help. \n\n\r  \n\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve this. Why don\u2019t you let me take care of you? Look at the mirror. Don\u2019t be afraid. I am with you. Be of courage. I am with you.\u201d \n\n\r  \nBreathe. Breathe. Breathe.",

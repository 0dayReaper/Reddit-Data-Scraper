    "postText": "Hello, I know this server says not for relationship advice so I'm not looking for any, and I'm not a big reddit used so please go easy on me lol. I have been dating the same man for about 5 years, people have called us high school sweethearts because we both met when we were 17. We are both 22 now and its different to say the least.\n\nThe first year of our relationship was really good actually, my boyfriend is shy, but charismatic once you get to know him. Hes extremely funny, like to the point where I cant breath because I'm laughing so hard. Hes also incredibly creative, he has this scetchbook full of amazing drawings that are so cool to watch him put out. Hes also really cute.\n\nHe also likes playing video games, like a lot. He has THOUSANDS of hours in multiple games and spends all of his free time playing them.\n\nMost of the memories I have of the last 5 years are me talking to him while hes sitting at his gaming PC. We have never had a lot of time together. Now if you think thats bad, it gets worse. I'm not sure if this is the law everywhere but where I am once you turn 18 you are no longer legally required to attend school, even if you havent gotten your diploma yet. And thats exactly what he did. It started with him missing like a day during the week, then most of the week, then not showing up at all. I got my high school diploma. He did not.\n\nOh and it gets even worse. Both of us are 22 now, its been a little over 3 years since then. He has never had a stable job since I've met him, nonetheless since he stopped going to school. Oh, and did I mention this entire time we have lived at my parents house? Yeah it gets worse.\n\nMy parents LOVE my boyfriend, they say that the reason hes acting like this is because of his upbringing, hes so depressed that he cant get a job, he cant make a doctors appointment, he cant finish high school. \n\nBut I'm the one who shares a bedroom with him, who watches him make his microwaves burritos and then laugh with his friends while I just sit on the bed waiting for something to happen. \n\nThe first time he got me a flower was THIS valintines day. We had already spent 4 years together and that was the first time. But you know what? I loved it, when hes funny I want it to last forever and when he consoles me after crying I think hes the best man in the world. I can genuinely see myself falling down this cycle and marrying him and I do NOT want that for myself. But I have no idea how to get out of it. \n\nI'm starting college in September and hopefully moving out of my parents house directly after I finish. If he wants to stay with Debroah and George thats fine by me. ",

He's gotta understand that he needs to grow up and become an actual adult. Then, if he truly loves you, he will change, and if he doesn't, he won't. He will make the decision for you through his actions. But don't accept superficial changes, only real ones. Don't throw your life away. These demands are not negotiable.",

We stayed friends and when I moved to his city for university we ended up getting together. Within a few months of us being together he had unofficially moved in with me (just stopped going home). I felt bad for him because his mother had died when he was 4 and his grandparents had raised him. His father was giving him money, but was rather absent from his life. I thought he needed some attention and company. At that time I was living off whatever my parents were giving me and a small job I had on the side. He did not once pay rent or offer to split the rent. He did not once offer to give me some of the money from his dad for groceries. Instead he spent day in and day out playing WoW and spending his money on weed and online poker. He dropped out of university and I barely saw him anymore, even though we lived together. He was awake all night while I was sleeping and slept while I was awake during the day. The straw that broke the camels back was when we went shopping with his dad and I bought a few more groceries than usual and his father said \"well no wonder he has no money left if you guys shop like this\". Excuse me??? Well long story short I moved abroad to study and broke up with him. He tried to guilt trip me by saying I ruined his life and he was going to propose. Well I am 33 years old now and have not once looked back to the relationship with him and thought it was a mistake to break up. If anything I kinda wanna kick myself for not doing it sooner.",

I\u2019ve never met a girl that isn\u2019t into cuddling, but who knows? Maybe there\u2019s someone out there who isn\u2019t or someone you\u2019re willing to compromise with",

Very light sleeper who needs his own space and girls usually complain about it\u2026literally can\u2019t sleep if I do it and don\u2019t want to stay up an extra 30-45 minutes until they fall asleep to slink out of it",

I usually cuddle for a while and when I\u2019m ready, explain why I need some space in order to sleep (and reassure the guy I\u2019m with that it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to cuddle more, it\u2019s just that I need to sleep). It\u2019s been a reasonable compromise for me so far",

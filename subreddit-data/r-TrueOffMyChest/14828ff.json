    "postText": "yeah pretty much summed it up in the title.didn't attend public school until junior year, never got much attention from girls there, didn't get much better since i also flunked my freshman year of college so bad i got suspended and now i'm back living at home. i don't know any other person atm 17+ years  old with less romantic experience than me. it makes me extremely insecure and distracts me from what i'm doing. my self esteem is really affected as well. i feel like i will never be considered attractive because the idea of a girl liking a guy with as little experience as me at my age is insane. i know i am not completely alone in this situation but it feels that way a lot of the time.",

Not only will you build credits it will force you to socialize in you down time.\n\nPS girls don\u2019t care about your past experience or lack there of. If she likes you and wants to sleep with you, letting her know your a virgin might be embarrassing for you, but it\u2019ll likely make her want to give it to you sooner rather then later.",

But it also makes sense not to sleep around. Less of a chance of diseases and it makes that one you decide to lose it to that much more special",

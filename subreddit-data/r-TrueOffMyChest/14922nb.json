    "postText": "tw: mental + physical ab* (?)\n\nidc abt grammar errors\n\nI went to my dads house earlier to print out a copy of my resume and my mum came to pick me up. They were talking for a while and then my mom was telling him i could\u2019ve printed it out at home if i had just asked my stepdad (her bf/siblings dad). My dad looked at me and was asking why i didn\u2019t just ask him- i didn\u2019t answer, then my mum started saying that im being rude and disrespectful to him. (Context: last year around march he fought my mom and i interfered, he ended up chocking me and throwing me at the wall. My mums face was swollen for weeks she even had to go to the hospital for ear pain.) He sighed and told me that i was overreacting i didn\u2019t say anything and my mum took us home.\n\nwhat really made me upset was what both of my parents had said. im not speaking to him (stepdad) bc of everything that he did. he slapped my youngest sister when she was in 2nd grade and proceeded to lie about it even though is hand print was on her fucking face. he told us that all we was good for was shit and talked badly about my mum calling her a whore and a no good mother. he talked about my family saying how they will get no where in life he compared my sister and i to his exs daughter saying that well never be like them we\u2019re a disgrace. The two of them knows all of this everytime bc everytime he said something i would tell my mom and what would she do absolute fucking nothing",

    "postText": "I'm a mental health therapist(f48)who has jumped back into dating (males) after a ten year dating hiatus.\n\nI've met a few men, taken some time to get to know them, and dang. Usually about a month into getting to know these guys I'm hearing phrases like \"emotionally dead inside\" and \"unable to understand my own or other's feelings\". They are angry and irritated at the core of their emotional lives and have very low levels of positive emotion. I feel so horrible for them when they disclose these things to me. It's very sad.\n\nI'd like to think that my sample size is low and that my observations cannot be generalized to the entire  heterosexual male population, but my gut tells me otherwise. I think there is a male mental health crisis. Your mental health does matter. And I wish I could fix it all for everyone of you, and I can't.\n\nEdit: Yes, the mental health system is completely overwhelmed. I know it's difficult in the first place to reach out for help only to find wait lists and costs that are way out of hand in most places. Please keep trying. Community mental health centers usually have sliding scales and people to help get access to insurance.\n\nThere are so many mentions of suicide. Please, seek help, even if it's just reaching out to the suicide prevention hotline.\nhttps://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/\n\nI'm trying to read all the comments, as some of them are insightful and valuable. I appreciate all who have constructively shared their thoughts and stories.\n\nFor those who have reached out via private message, I am working on getting back with you all. \n\nThank you all for the rewards.",

My father is a boomer, as was my mom, he knew he was gay at the age of 12, but as was popular at the time in an Irish roman catholic family, he suppressed it, did what mom and dad expected and found my mom to marry and start a family. They managed to almost get to kid #3 before my dad was outed (mom walked in on him cheating w/ a dude when I was 2, while she was pregnant with with my little brother), thing is, she already knew, it's partly why she married him, because she was also queer and doing the exact same thing of marrying and starting a family as was expected of her. \n\nThe fucked up part was, you would think that my dad of all people, would have been sensitive / woke to the shitty idea of gender norms and misogamy, but he also never changed a single fucking diaper in his life. He might have been gay, but he still expected every other societal norm from his wife that every other male did at the time. This is how pervasive it was. Without growing up in that culture, you can only observe it from the outside in, we can never truly understand it from the viewpoint of someone who spent birth through adolescence with that being the norm.",

But it'll pass - surely you'll be happy any day now. \n\nI told myself when I hit 40 - man, it's been so long, happiness must be just around the corner. \n\nWhen I was 43 I was chatting to my Dr and agreed (without giving it much thought) some anti-anxiety medication. I was significantly happier within two weeks with no other changes, and when I found a good complementary medicine to go with it*, I was as close to as being 'cured' as I'd ever been. \n\n(*I'm not gonna say what my 'supplementary' medicine is, as it's different for everyone.)\n\nI wasted 40 years of life (and happiness, and potential) by \"manning up\" and waiting for happiness. (I did do a bunch of other things as well, of course - got fit at times, gave up drinking, smoking at times - tried hobbies, interests, counselors, therapists, a wife, blah blah blah...nothing would work, and of course now I know that that was because my mind was sick and until that was fixed, nothing else would bring me happiness. \n\nI was *resilient* for those 40 years, and whilst that's a GOOD thing, because it kept me alive, and fighting, boy do I wish I had done something sooner. \n\nThere's one thing that I think a lot of people might skip over in what you wrote, u/johnlsullivan2, and that is this:  *\"it's possible to find happiness in so many different ways.\"*\n\nThis is SO true - but in case it's not apparent, this also means that if you try things and they don't work, don't just keep doing them in the hopes that THIS time they might have better results. \n\nI don't know why I never considered medication - I just don't. I think a part of me thought: \"dude, you're a white guy in his (20s, 30s, 40s), you have a good job, and friends, you don't have any real health concerns, both your parents are alive...what the fuck have you got to complain about?\"\n\nOf course, what I had to complain about was the fact that I was so sick that I fantasised about killing myself 10, 20 times a day. I knew I would never do it - I couldn't hurt my parents like that - which I'm grateful for, but when I got lucky with my meds and suddenly only started thinking about suicide once a month or so, boy did it really show me how different things could be. \n\nI'm not angry at my brain - in fact I'm eternally grateful that it got me through everything, for SO long, with only the occasional bit of happiness (usually the rare occasions I'd get my hands on MDMA) - but fuck me, though it definitely gave me 'resilience', is NOT the same thing as happiness. \n\nGood post dude!",

I remember going to her and expressing how depressed and stressed I was and her response was to \u201cbe stronger,\u201d no conversation to help, just that it was embarrassing for me to be acting like that. She brought this up when I ended it (still depressed from the recent event) and once again mocked me for being so affected by the situation. It was then I knew I was making the right choice to walk away. The mental health stigma will continue as long as women and men ridicule for reaching out and expressing these bad feelings, not just the good.\n\nEdit: A little late, but I will clarify that it wasn't a full on mental breakdown but for my usual stoic demeanor the sudden expression of sadness, grief, and general depression was as close to a breakdown as I have ever had - it left me in a very dark place and the breakup only made that worse. Thank you for the kind words, it has been 2 years since then and while I haven't dated since I am now aware of what to look for in a future partner.",

Bad timing to have a break down lol. Since finished therapy and doing much better. It really is better than the meds the doctors try to push. Turns out I was severely anxious in a general sense and a tendency to dissociate due to trouble growing up. Ex wife was in touch last month wanting to meet up and be there for me. What a coincidence, she's recently single, jobless and has a child to raise (not mine, thank god) with a guy who's not interested. No thanks.

Getting together just for the sake of getting together anymore is simply not an option. Example: I am an avid cyclist, and I have not seen most of my cycling \"friends\" since this pandemic began. I do reach out from time to time, but everyone \"has plans\". Eventually I'm just going to stop asking.",

For most of my female friends, getting together to just shoot the shit is entirely viable, but for men it generally has to involve doing something. Even if it's something as mundane as shooting hoops or drinking, it almost always revolves around an activity.\n\nI dont know if I would characterize it as superficial. It's more a thing of whether you consider talking an activity in and of itself, or if you prefer to socialize while doing something else. For me and my buds it's usually the latter, since if I want to talk to them I can just message them, while meeting up in person (especially as an adult with limited time) usually involves a different thing as well",

Similar things to this have happened at the hand of either sex, this one just being the most drastic.\n2. She's not the devil for doing this, calm down.

No way. I cut that right off (in a nice way) and it felt really good. It sucks to be lonely, but it sucks even worse to beg for attention from someone who's distant. \n\nKeep looking, there ARE women who want to be friends or be in a relationship with someone who likes being active and interactive. Like Tony Robbins has said - it's all about standards. You have to hold yourself to standards, and also be willing to cut people out of your life who won't meet the basic standards of kindness.",

I guess it's the outcome I was after: she knows where I stand and what I offer, but she has to decide whether she wants to play her part.\n\nFWIW, I'm not asking that we become exclusive right away, or that she has to text me all the time, just a little more feedback. Not leaving me on read for days and then responding with \"oh, sorry, yeah, maybe next Tuesday?\". IDK. I am actually still interested, but the interaction has to be there.",

It was so intense. \nSo many people have so much darkness inside them but as a culture we don't talk about it.\nI was one of those people before I went in but realised that I would never be happy if I didn't share how I felt. Which since doing so I've not stopped because I'm sick of pretending everything isn't insane in the world around me. It takes too much effort to pretend anymore.\n\nMy therapist compared me Teflon when I went in which I took as a compliment. However he explained that it wasn't a good thing to not let things bother me. It wasn't a sign of strength as I thought. Was way too many men that I know pretend it's all fine and it's hard to be around them. Overall I prefer to be around women now because they are in general more open. Open men I am of course really glad to be around.",

As much as the comments here are talking about \"it's all generations\" I think that the generation OP is discussing is unique compared to, say, 17 year olds who claim they feel the same way. \n\nNot to say that 17 year olds can't also feel this way. but I think it's unlikely they've gone through the same challenges of men 40+, especially for very extended periods of time like those men have just by living more than 2x longer. A 17 year old has likely not been *party* to a messy divorce. To being cheated on by your lawful partner. Having a partner die. Or been lonely for 40 years and thinking about all their failed relationships. \n\nSpeaking as a mid-20s male.",

            "comment": "I've tried to reach out to therapists multiple times but I get really unhelpful (and expensive) advice like \"sleep more\".  I really just think people don't give a fuck about men to be honest.  When my wife met with a therapist they were ready to get her on all kinds on prescriptions and meet with other doctors, all kinds of things.  I realize that not every person is the same, but the stark contrast between how our situations were handled when we both have a lot of the same issues is what kinda sours me on the idea of trying for a forth time.  I'm not looking for drugs, just some kind of inclination that the person I'm paying gives a fuck and wants to find a solution.\n\n\nedit: all of you saying anti-women shit are really not helping and I don't fuck with anything you're saying.  This isn't an \"us vs them\" problem.  Women didn't cause this issue.",

            "comment": "There are a lot of toxic messages being directed at all men these days, and we\u2019re all expected to silently swallow the toxins and not give a word of complaint. I hate Trump, but a part of why he won is because he represented a way for predominantly straight white men to lash back at society for the bullshit we\u2019re being made to swallow.\n\n\u201cBullshit? Such as what?\u201d\nCancel culture. The left has become obsessed with identity politics. Who is the common villain to blame for all of societies ails? Straight white men. There isn\u2019t a better boogey man to stand up. Why? Because nobody will dare oppose it or stand up to a claim. Women can dogpile on men, and its not sexist. To protest, you\u2019re sexist against women. The LGBTQ community can dogpile as well and to oppose their claims would be considered transphobic. People of any other race can also dogpile on us, because to oppose them, you just get called a racist. Its the holy trifecta of identity politics to blame, dogpile and smash straight white men in all discourse about whats wrong with society, and men typically won\u2019t say anything since we tend to \u201cman up\u201d and \u201cdeal with it\u201d. Instead, we bottle it up. We swallow it. We hope the toxin dissipates over time, but it rots our soul in the process. We can\u2019t ask for help. It\u2019s a waste of time, because there isn\u2019t any. Nobody listens because nobody cares. How many cases of domestic violence do you hear about being committed against men? Very, very few - not because it doesn\u2019t happen, but because men don\u2019t report it. Yet, men silently suffer DV just as often as women. How many DV shelters can you find for men in your city? Usually none, and one if you\u2019re lucky. What about those of us who are facing homelessness? If a woman faces homelessness, there are lots of resources for her to use, including the possibility of living with friends and family. Men? We don\u2019t matter. Men are left to fend for themselves on the streets, whithering away until we go crawl under some rock to quietly die where we won\u2019t bother anyone by inconveniencing them with our presence.\nHow little do men matter to society? We\u2019re disposable. If a man dies, it doesn\u2019t really matter. We\u2019re meant to die. In a sinking ship, when passengers are being loaded onto life rafts, its \u201cwomen and children first!\u201d. When negotiating for the release of hostages, its \u201cplease release the women and children as a sign of good faith\u201d, and when it comes to war, every boy at the age of 18 has to sign up for the draft, but women of similar age don\u2019t. If there\u2019s a mining accident or some other workplace disaster and a handful of men die (because of course its just men!), then does society and media care? Do we get a candlelit vigil in our remembrance? Nope!\nBottom line is that adult men are expected to come last and die first because we matter the least. How do you suppose that might affect our mental health and attitudes towards life and society?\nBut then, when you consider the dismal state of marriage and family, it gets even more abysmal. A lot of stink has been made recently about systemic racism and how a lot of it is very prevalent and unconscious in various institutions. While there is some truth to that, is anyone raising their voices and shouting about the overt systemic sexism in our society when it comes to treating men fairly? 50% of couples get divorced. 80% of the time, the divorce is initiated by a woman. Sometimes, it can be a \u201cno fault\u201d divorce, where a man doesn\u2019t even screw anything up, but he gets divorced for \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d. During divorce proceedings, he loses 50% of his net worth he worked his ass off for, grinding away at some thankless job just so that the wife and kiddos had a roof over their heads and food to eat. And, *most* men absolutely love their children, no less than women do, and yet when a divorce court rules for child custody, it is almost always granted to the women! The divorce lawyers know exactly how to game the system against men, they know exactly what gets children taken away, exactly how to fleece men of their money and maximize their pain, and how to limit the amount of time a man can spend being a father to their children\u2026 as far as the legal system is widely concerned, men don\u2019t deserve anything and shouldn\u2019t get anything. If you end up owing child support, you are threatened with stiff jail time for not paying. In other words, lose 50% of your net worth, then pay 50% of your paycheck, and if you don\u2019t work, then you go to jail. Men aren\u2019t allowed to \u201canti-work\u201d, we have to be wage slaves.\n\nTo compound things further: To advocate for men and to be a proponent for \u201cmens rights\u201d, is often seen as sexist and misogynistic, regardless of how much merit an issue men are facing has. Men\u2019s rights advocates quickly get branded as haters, shut down for hate speech by their detractors, and there\u2019s a rush to cancel them \u2014 \u201chow dare they speak up for the boogey man/whipping boy! The insolence!\u201d\n\nAnd then, people have the audacity to lay the current problems of society at the feet of men who\u2019ve been denied the opportunity to be fathers? And people wonder why so many men are quietly facing mental health problems and feelings of worthlessness? Why there\u2019s a quiet seething rage in every man that sometimes manifests itself as a vote for monsters like Trump? Why anyone is surprised that mass shooters are typically all men, who are lashing out from the anguish of their mental health problems in the only way they know how to be heard and seen? Straight white men are the worlds best scapegoats for all problems \u2014 \u201cwe\u2019re strong, we can take it\u201d, right? But what about those among us who aren\u2019t so strong anymore, or ever were? And under decades of persistent toxicity constantly grinding men down, how long can anyone be strong? When all your cartoons growing up portray men as bumbling, incapable idiots (homer simpson, peter griffin, etc), when sexist statements  at mens expense always get a free pass but the same thing said about women would cause national outrage followed by PR trying to soothe things over?\n\nI am an advocate for equal rights. Nobodies gain should be another's loss. Some men are terrible scoundrels (and ought to be rightfully condemned and held accountable for their behaviors), but many men are not. It\u2019s tempting to paint all men with the same brush because it\u2019s intellectually easy, but its sloppy and hurtful to the rest of us to be lumped in with the scoundrels. \n\nI think we\u2019re going to be facing a crisis in the very near future when it comes to men. You need not look any further than college and university enrollment these days. Men account for only 40% of university students these days and that number is dropping at an alarming rate. In fact, it has been accelerating lately. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it became 70% women and 30% men by the end of the decade, with a majority of men coming from international students. If this trend continues for a decade, there is going to be an increasing labor shortage of men and that will leave a lot of disaffected and disgruntled men in society \u2014 and if history is an indicator, that never leads to good outcomes.\n\nWe need to take care of men and treasure them too. We all matter. Nobody should be sidelined because of their gender, sexual orientation or skin color.",

    "postText": "  Recently I\u2019ve been jealous of my boyfriends \u201cboobs\u201d. They are bigger then mine and for some reason it really pisses me off. Like BAD. He\u2019s been working out a lot bringing me with him. He\u2019s happy with my body as is and when I weighed more (280 when we dated the second time). (This will kinda matter later)\n\n  He\u2019s definitely no Greek god bod but he is looking like the beginning stages of it. However his man boobs are just popping. He always wears tight shirts at the gym and I see people looking. I\u2019ll be honest I get jealous but I never act on it. \n\n  Sometimes I question why I got lucky to be with a guy like him. Not only for his personality but he\u2019s also way out of my league. But I also have to take into consideration the first time we dated how I would always be there for him and would cook for him all the time. Sing to him and just treat him with more then the bare minimum. I\u2019ll be honest he was a really skinny loner kid. He didn\u2019t take care of himself much either. Plus I was also his first and I\u2019m pretty sure his only gf so far. \n\n  Here\u2019s when it became a \u201cproblem\u201d. A few hours ago I went to the gym with him and one of our mutuals ( we will call him Danny) and his gf (who we will call tiff) who we only met once before. She hasn\u2019t been nice to me. She\u2019d make snide remarks on my body. Usually my healed self harm scars (been clean for almost a year). \n\n  A little backstory on Tiff. When we met her she kept bringing up how me and him started dating again. It was a fucked up situation and toxic on my part but we got through it and are stronger together now. She brought it up not even an hour after meeting her. She kept making \u201cjokes\u201d about my body but I didn\u2019t say anything about it. After they left my boyfriend told me how she made him really uncomfortable. \n\n  I\u2019ve been insecure about my body since I grew up the fat kid. I\u2019m still on the heavy side but I\u2019ve gained more confidence in myself and my body since dating my bf. He tells me I\u2019m the only woman he\u2019d want and gives me constant reassurance and attention. I have no doubts about his loyalty what so ever. \n\n  Anyways back to the problem at the gym. When Danny and Tiff arrived I already could tell that it wasn\u2019t going to be a good day. \n\n  Remember how I said my bf wears really tight shirts to the gym? The whole time she was eyeballing him. He didn\u2019t notice nor did Danny cause they were both in their own little bro world. They were doing weights while I was doing the treadmill. Tiff decided to use the treadmill next to mine. I tried to be nice and start a conversation and avoid bringing up her eyeballing my bf. \n\n  It went ok. Not good or bad but she brought up my boyfriend\u2019s body. She compared me to him. Mentioned how his chest was bigger then mine. He has \u201cdaddy milkers\u201d like wtf. It made me feel bad about my boobs. How he was more fit then me. How he was more attractive and out of my league. \n\n  I wanted to cry but I didn\u2019t want to do it in front of her. She talked about how she\u2019d be better with a guy like him then him being with and this is her words \u201csomeone built like a Big Mac\u201d. Honestly kinda clever. I\u2019ll be honest I stopped to her low as well. She\u2019s very thin kinda looks unhealthy. Flat in both ways. I\u2019m ashamed I said this but I told her that if we are what you eat she\u2019d be nothing. Told her that I could grate cheese on her rib cage. \n\n  She just up and left. I was so shaken up I just got up and went to one of the benches and just sat there feeling bad but also proud of what I said. Mostly bad I\u2019ll be honest but I tried to justify it in my head but I just feel bad now. \n\n  When Danny realized his gf wasn\u2019t in the gym he said his goodbyes and left. My boyfriend came up to me and asked if I was ready to leave and I just wanted out. \n\n  The second we got in the car I just started bawling. I told him everything that happened. What she said to me and what I said to her. When I told him what I said he laughed at it and told me it was a good one. He told me I don\u2019t do anything wrong and just gave her a taste of her own medicine. \n\n  He\u2019s going to talk to Danny about what happened tomorrow. He doesn\u2019t want to ever see tiff again nor have me be around her. I\u2019m nervous in all honesty I just feel bad about everything.\n\n    EDIT: my bf went out and got me a few treats and a cupcake cause he was happy I stood up for myself and to help cheer me up. I don\u2019t really stand up for myself but I stand up for others especially people I care about.",

Hurtful language about body image can have significant negative impacts on an individual's mental health and self-esteem. It may also be triggering. When someone is subjected to derogatory comments about their appearance, they may begin to feel ashamed or embarrassed about their body, leading to feelings of low self-worth and poor body image. This can result in harmful behaviors such as disordered eating or excessive exercising to change their body in an attempt to conform to societal beauty standards. Moreover, hurtful language about body image can also contribute to the development of anxiety and depression, leading to long-term consequences on an individual's mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to promote body positivity and refrain from making negative comments about someone's appearance.

You feel bad because you aren\u2019t naturally nasty to people and so acting out of character doesn\u2019t sit well with you. And to clarify, your \u201cnastiness\u201d was well deserved and incredibly minor compared to hers. If she can\u2019t handle what she\u2019s serving she should learn to keep her mouth shut.\n\nI\u2019m also sensitive to stuff like this and I don\u2019t hesitate in standing up for myself but I don\u2019t like feeling like I\u2019ve waded into their filth. So instead of reflecting their body shaming behavior or (insert any other form of bigotry here), I just call out their behavior bluntly. It makes people incredibly uncomfortable being seen when they don\u2019t want to be. For example, you can just look her dead in the face with a look of pity and/or disgust and tell her \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine going through life feeling so completely powerless that I\u2019d resort to pathetic attempts at tearing the people around me down. You can try as hard as you want to hide it but everyone can still see that you\u2019re rotting on the inside. How devastating for you.\u201d\n\nObviously you can change up how you phase this depending on the situation and what I you think is going on under the surface. The point is that when they lash out, they expect fire in return, give them ice. This way, you hit them where it hurts while avoiding toxic behaviors that harm or oppress entire groups of people.",

You are enough. \n\nIt\u2019s so easy to get bogged down in \u201cbut you shouldn\u2019t want me, I\u2019m X Y Z\u201d but that\u2019s some horseshit quite frankly; you don\u2019t get to decide how he should, or does, feel about you. He decides that, and he\u2019s decided that he loves you. Trust and believe him when he tells you, he\u2019s not lying nor does he have an ulterior motive. \n\nYou deserve to love yourself, and he deserves a partner who isn\u2019t putting herself down. Every person has something wonderful and special about them, and he sees you for who you are - not who you think you are. Chin up darling, and try to leave these awful thoughts about yourself behind; they help no one.\n\nAlso, that was a sick burn and you have nothing to feel ashamed of!

She was clearly insecure around you and wanting your man and acted on it in inappropriate ways. Everyone has their insecurities, yours are your weight and breasts and clearly this girl is insecure about being so bony. Anyway, she\u2019s not important. Forget about her. Your bf is right to never want you around her again as she\u2019s toxic and she would probably bring out the worst in you.\n\nI\u2019m also proud of you for going through dbt therapy and no longer self harming. That takes a lot of strength. The only thing that is concerning is your jealousy of your bf\u2019s man boobs. Look, he seems to be a blessing in your life so don\u2019t blow it! If you want bigger boobs, get a boob job or come to accept your body as it is but it\u2019s not healthy to covet what other people have especially ones that are building you up and beneficial to you.",

One of those I\u2019d think about once after the person left.\nYour insecurity about your boobs compared to your bf\u2019s though sounds unhealthy and kind of weird. I think there are plenty of beautiful small chested women , and actually wouldn\u2019t consider a man\u2019s large breast size to be an attractive feature.\nMaybe the people staring at him aren\u2019t doing it because it\u2019s hot, but more because it just catches attention. \nI also certainly would stay away from her from this point.

    "postText": "\nIm 30. I live with my dad &amp; 2 younger brothers. My brother is 25. He has been working for a company for a while and he had dreams of getting promoted for top salary\u2026 they actually hinted he\u2019d get promoted but last minute they changed their minds &amp; DEMOTED him to part time last year (who knows, he probably did something wrong).\n\nHe has been in a deep dark hole ever since. He decided to turned to alcohol to make him self feel better. (Im not talking budweiser, im talking heavy liquor). He drinks every. single. day. And when he is sober, he is MUTE. He does not wanna talk to anyone about anything. He does NOT wanna even TRY to get a new job. He is convinced he will get this \u201cpromotion\u201d one day. And in the meantime he wants to drink his life away. He already totaled his car while drunk. My dad mistakenly bought him a new one, and he continues to go out drinking and driving every. single. day. \n\nOn top of all this\u2026 He has mass amounts of monthly bills/expenses/car insurance that he can not afford. He is BROKE. He makes 300$/week on average from part time hours.. &amp; he spends all that at the bars. My dad has been paying for all his bills for 7 MONTHS! Ive never seen my dad so stressed and depressed mentally physically and financially.. its all because of my brothers situation. Im worried about my dads health just as much as i am about my brothers. Its so bad that my dad is turning MUTE. He is too down and upset about everything.\n\nMy brother does not want to get help. He does not want to stop drinking. He claims he is fine and everything/everyone around him is at fault. He is not going to change. At this pace im very very concerned that things will not end well. Now my dad who is a happy go lucky guy is now become depressed! \nThis house has fallen apart.\nI just want to run away and disappear.\n\nI really dont know what to do! Anyone?",

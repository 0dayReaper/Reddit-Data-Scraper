    "postText": "Six years ago, i swapped my then-girlfriend now-wife's cat with a more well-behaved lookalike.\n\nShe had an all black cat that was extremely aggressive. It scratched everyone, hissed at everyone, and didn't use its litterbox half the time. My wife insisted she could get it to behave better. One week she went out of town to visit her family and I was supposed to go to her apartment and feed it. \n\nThe first night I went over, it scratched the shit out of my arm. I joked to the cat that it's not special and I'll replace it if it scratches again. The joke stuck with me until I had thought about it enough that it wasn't a joke. The next morning I went to the local animal shelter. Found an identical cat who was already litterbox trained and acclimated to people, but was a little skiddish (it's old owner died of a heart attack and the animal shelter people said they think that's why it was skiddish). But overall, it was a lot friendlier and better behaved, and the skiddishness would help it resemble the original cat. \n\nSo I adopted it, took it to my wife's apartment, settled it in, then drove her original cat to an animal shelter a town over (I was paranoid my wife would find out if I took it to a local one).\n\nIt's been 6 years since then. We got married 4 years ago. We still have the swapped cat. It answers to the original cat's name. My wife knows nothing. She loves this cat and brags about how much better behaved it is. Everytime I see it, I feel like a total piece of shit.\n\nEdit: For the people saying the other cat was likely euthanized by the shelter, I just double-checked and the shelter I dropped it off at was and still is a no-kill shelter.",

Their furs are different, one is very soft and the other is slightly coarser, their meows are completely different, one classic cat noise and the other more of a high pitched mew/squeak, their head shapes are slightly different with one having thinner cheek bones, their eyes are different, and most of all their behavior is completely different with one being a lazy layabout and the other constantly hunting and causing trouble. They both have their own quirks and different ways of showing affection and their own favorite toys and locations. Anyone who has had pets knows how different they can be. They may share habits and features, but they're all pretty unique in their own way just like people.\n\nAll this to say, the husband is an asshole and an idiot for thinking he could pass off a random cat, sticking to the story after being immediately found out, and then trying to make it like she was being crazy. Accident or not, the dude doubled down on a lie and then tripled down with the gaslighting. Just a trifecta of bullshit.",

My husband and I have been married for four years, living together for five years - so I had Smokey before this relationship started.\n&gt;\n&gt;I went on a three week long business trip, when I came home my husband welcomed me and acted completely normal. Smokey didn't welcome me, so I called for her - husband told me she must be napping or something. I found \"Smokey\" hiding under an armchair in the living room and thought that she must be spooked since I was gone for three weeks. I got down on the ground to reach out and pet her and, well, I've had my cat for seven years. I know every single whisker of hers. The pitch black yellow-eyed cat was NOT Smokey. Once she got out from under the armchair I confirmed that yep, this is NOT MY CAT. \n&gt;\n&gt;I asked my husband what's up with smokey and he just waved his hand, said she's just excited to see me and whatever. I felt like in a fucking Twilight Zone episode. I told my husband that this is not Smokey. He looked at me as if I have grown another head and ask me what do I mean. I repeated that this cat is not my cat. Where is my cat.\n&gt;\n&gt;He kept assuring me that this is my cat, I honestly started getting kind of panicked and hysterical. I'm not proud of it but I ended up screaming at him to cut the bullshit and tell me what the hell happened to my cat since this is not Smokey. He called me an \"insane bitch\" and just drove off.\n&gt;\n&gt;I felt so crazy and shaken, I called my sister to come over. I pulled up photos of Smokey on my laptop, told my sister to compare and to just look at how the cat is behaving - the cat knew the house obviously, but regarded me as a stranger. My sister confirmed that the cat is very similar to Smokey but small details give her off - eye hue, facial shape. All those things you just notice when you own an animal for seven freaking years.\n&gt;\n&gt;My husband came home later on and my sister and I confronted him again. He finally broke down and admitted that just a few days into my business trip, he STEPPED ON SMOKEY in such a way that it killed her. Broke her ribs, punctured her lungs... he rushed to the vet but the vet could only end her suffering since she was dying. First of all how do you step on a cat this hard, did he stomp? I'm still so shocked and angry. Anyways, following some stupid freaking logic the way people do when they replace a dead hamster or a dead fish to trick their small kids, he spent a week going thru cat shelters everywhere to get a similar cat - color, build, age. \n&gt;\n&gt;He had THE NERVE to end this by telling me that he doesn't see what the big deal is, he didn't want to tell me about the death because he didn't want to upset me, and he went really \"OUT OF HIS WAY\" to get a same looking cat, so I have no reason to be angry! \n&gt;\n&gt;He killed my pet, lied to me, and most of all - what the hell is with that approach, I feel like he considers me to be a stupid child. Either he thinks I'm the stupidest person alive, or HE IS one. \n&gt;\n&gt;Either way, this is just an absolute breach of everything for me that the same day I told him that I'm packing my shit and moving over to my sister's place, also I'm getting the divorce papers next day. He freaked out, crying, saying how much he loves me - then getting angry and yelling at me that I would let a stupid animal ruin all we had. He even tried to use the poor Not-Smokey as a way to keep me, threatening to give her to a kill shelter. Needless to say, I did include Not-Smokey in the stuff I packed - as much as I absolutely hate my husband right now, the poor kitten did nothing wrong. \n&gt;\n&gt;The following day I was absolutely flooded by messages from both sides of the family. Apparently the story my husband sent out is that he accidentally killed our cat, spent the day and night apologising to me and crying, but I yelled at him and insulted him and yadda yadda. No word about the cat swap and treating me like a child/idiot and calling me an insane bitch when I didn't play along.\n&gt;\n&gt;How the hell do I continue. Divorce is a must. We didn't have children, the house was rental. I love my in-laws, should I tell them my version? Looking back on all this (I'm writing this two days after it all happened), I'm obviously still insanely upset, but am wondering if I'm throwing my marriage under the bus over a small thing... or are just my in-laws' messages getting to me? How would you react if this happened to you? I'm very emotional now, absolutely not over Smokey's death. \n&gt;\n&gt;(Not-Smokey is coping fine and enjoying her life in my sister's household)",

A couple weeks later it turned up at a shelter. She brought it home. My husband and I were like ummm that dog does not look like Libby. I mean, it kind of did. It was a brindle boxer. Same height, weight. But something was slightly off. She was sure it was Libby though. \"Look, she comes to me! She does X and Y and Z etc. Blah blah blah\" Well a few days later, the shelter calls, asking MIL to bring Gucci the dog back. Yeah, Gucci. Some other lady was missing Gucci. Oops. My MIL is goofy as hell, but she loved that dog. No, it wasn't chipped. Not everyone does that. Some areas of the US, it's just not even a thing. She had even taken the dog to her vet to check it up after the tornado and all. Vet didn't notice any difference and why would he? The vet sees presumably hundreds, maybe thousands of dogs as patients like what, once a year each?",

Add religious trauma, physical abuse, and narcissism.\n\nUnfortunately that was the last time I ever saw the kitten, its mom, and the rest of its siblings. There were a lot of them even tho it was only one litter, and my parents decided that litter boxes crossed the line and that all the cats would do well using the bathroom outside. So guess what playful group of kittens decided to go rummaging in the landlord's trash, and the landlord decided that we needed to completely get rid of all the cats. I loved them all, but that one orange kitten was my favorite. It would walk with me to the bus every morning and try to go with me to school, and it would be waiting with my mom for me when I got back and it would jump into my arms and let me carry it home.\n\nMy in parents weren't willing to even ask if we could keep that one kitten because of a litter box. They took a ~6 year old kid with them to watch as they dumped these inside cats out of a moving car so \"there's no chance they'd jump back in.\" This is over twenty years ago so the kitten would be incredibly old in a good home with vet care, but I like to think it was found by a good person who provided that and cherished how unique this kitten was.",

    "postText": "I (21M) have battled with a volatile bowel most of my life and despite this, the past three years have been calmer. However, back in last June, I started suffering from loose to full on liquid movements for 4 weeks culminating in one final attack on July 1st. The attacks started at the same time and followed the same pattern (sudden burning flatulence, that dull urgent diarrhoea stomach pain and the stools of course)\n\nThe next 6 months were quiet, things got back to normal and I brushed it off as just merely food poisoning until the beginning of the new year when out of the blue, it returned and from the next 4 weeks, it was a less violent repeat of last June. Once again culminating on the final day of the month (January).\n\nOnce again, the next 2 months were a return to normal and although perturbed, I dismissed it as something or other (Maybe a reaction to Christmas food or a reaction to giving up beer).\n\nAnd then, April rolls around and yep, same pattern although slightly more violent. Culminates on the first day of the next month and quietens down. After two weeks of seemingly normal form (albeit me being even more perturbed yet wanting to get on with life), We come to the early hours of this morning.\n\nI'd had slight stomach discomfort but not that aforementioned dull yet harrowing diarrhoea ache and had gone to bed as normal. Woke up at 5am and found I'd leaked out very badly (thankfully none got on my bedsheet). Just pure brown liquid. Nothing more, nothing less. After washing 5 times, I'm lying down typing this out. I'm no longer perturbed and more fully disturbed and distressed (considering it . Thankfully, I study from home and work later in the week and today is my day off.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAlso a few side notes.\n\nI've been monitoring what I eat on and off since last year. I was eating more bland foods and drinking less (giving up fully in January) but this has taken it's toll as at one point I dropped down from 9st 6oz to 8st 4oz (I'm 5 foot 10 BTW). After this, I introduced more sugary elements back and in March, weighed roughly 9st 2oz. However now, I've dropped back to 8st 7oz. I've had comments on my appearance for the last year with complaints of looking gaunt and in some cases, people believing I have an eating disorder but frankly I'm really embarrassed and scared to tell the truth.\n\nI have been struggling with my mental health this past year. Wider spread stresses and personal problems have taken their toll and I've wondered whether this is a result of stress.\n\nThe reason I haven't mentioned this to a Doctor IRL is A: aforementioned embarrasement and fear. B: The factors I initially thought might have played a factor and C: Wanting to forget about it and focus on the things I do love in life (Spending time with my dog, Art and outdoor walks)\n\nI am an ex smoker having started since I was 15 albeit an occasional smoker, becoming full time at 17 and giving up at 19 a year and a half later. I did switch to an e-cig but when the attacks seemed to start in January, I packed it in with surprisingly little fuss.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry if this sounds waffling or bizarre. I'm afraid to go back to sleep in case it happens again and it might seem meandering and droning.",

The intestinal flora is delicate and can be off. \n\nYou might have a parasite or Lyme disease which is easily treated. Don\u2019t deny yourself medical care that can save your life and make you feel a LOT better. You don\u2019t have to live with pain.",

    "postText": "I came home for the weekend, from my hostel. Everything was fine, until today. In the morning my mother said something to me which ended up hurting me a lot, I had a huge intense breakdown and cried to the point where I am almost burning and my eyes were red. Whatever my mother said brought up the past memories of the verbal and emotional abuse from her, done to me as a kid / all my life. I didn't eat anything the whole day and even kind of gave in to SH again (I have been SH free for almost 6 months now) \nI try to avoid my family, visiting my family as much as possible, but they were being nice and I thought things are getting better, I can tolerate them, maybe our relationship is healing, until today.\nPS - my mom isn't talking to me rn and thinks I am overreacting and that she isn't at fault.",

            "comment": "Abusive families will always have thier \"good days\" or \"nice times\" but choosing to be around them during those times is like handling a powder keg in a house on fire. You don't know When it will go off, but it will for sure, so run.\n\nIt is hard to cut family off, especially if you have siblings you want to save that are still trapped. However, you can only save people, if you save yourself first. I went little to no contact with an abusive grandmother. I only talked to her if she picked up the phone, and that was ONLY to ask to talk to one of my sisters and remind then I was there for them if they needed it. I hope this helps.",

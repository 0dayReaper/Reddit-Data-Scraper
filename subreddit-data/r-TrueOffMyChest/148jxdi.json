    "postText": "when I started high school I met a girl I became best friends with. a detail important for this story: my mom is very much into numerology and astrology and stuff like that and she likes to call herself a medium or a fortune teller (I\u2019m not sure about the right english translation). one day my friend (T) and my mom were talking about this topic a bit and my mom told T something I don\u2019t specifically remember but T told me that evening that she feels like she has a water on her chest. she didn\u2019t clarify it closer, like whether it\u2019s like inside or on her skin, just \u201cI feel water\u201d. \n\nafter that she would start to have dreams about me and about things that would happen. but only about me. a lot of them I don\u2019t remember after 7-8 years, but 2 stayed with me to this day and for some reason I think about it often in the recent weeks. \n\nI was abroad for a \u201cpractice training\u201d as a waitress from school and I met a guy there. we went out one night but there was nothing more to it. it\u2019s important to mention he was polish. the day or two after we went out T texted me \u201cdo you speak polish yet?\u201d I haven\u2019t told T about the guy because from the beginning of our friendship she was very jealous of any guy I dated or even not dated, just met. she wasn\u2019t in contact with anyone who was there with me, she had no way of knowing about it. so I asked her what she meant and she replied that \u201cI was dreaming some bullshit again\u201d I asked her to tell me more and it was just that I met a guy and that he was polish no specific details but that was enough for me.\n\nsomeone I told about this suggested whether she didn\u2019t have access to my social media, but at a time this happened I didn\u2019t even have the guy added anywhere and she would know things even after I changed my password just to be sure.\n\nsecond thing was, in our 3rd year, one day we were just having conversation about nothing, in class when somehow the topic of us doing something after we finish high school came, she just casually mentioned \u201coh we won\u2019t be friends anymore after school\u201d I was weirded out and asked her about it and she kinda shrugged it off saying because of a guy. and I know it\u2019s common to friendships end after school, but we\u2019re really not friends anymore and I think about it lately a lot so I thought I\u2019d put it out here.",

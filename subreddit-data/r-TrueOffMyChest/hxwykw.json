Ex: dinner's ready in 30 minutes... 15... 5 minutes.\n\nIf you just started a 15 minute match, knowing full well you have to stop in 5, it's your own damn fault. I gave you a deadline, when it's over you shut your game.\n\nEdit: Holy crap, I just woke up and saw this exploded overnight! Thank you for the replies, the awardsand tge multiple death treaths I've received! \n\nCouple of things since I can't answer everyone.\n\n1: I'm a dad, lot of people assumed I was a mom. No worries\n\n2: This is something that has been discussed with my kids beforehand. We've talked about the importance of time management and how this ties into it.\n\n3: Dinner is always around the same time. Bedtime is always around the same time. If dinner is in about 45 minutes and you play a game that can last up to two hours, then you probably should play something else at the moment.  (Although my kids don't play most of the long games you mentioned, no smithe or LOL etc. Mostly fortnight and Overwatch)\n\n4: Again... death threats? Some of you guys need to chill...",

It\u2019s a good idea to start out using a planner book and going in 1hr increments. Then developing your own into a cheaper-easily replaceable composition notebook that goes by 30 minute stamps.\n\nThis requires that you put important things on the schedule, the life progressing things like time to reflect, decompress, and destress, as well as any life facilitation things such as cooking, cleaning, and (this is a big one for me)any vehicular (20 yr old car) or home (110 yr old house) maintenance activities.\n\nThe biggest benefit I\u2019ve seen in my life is that I schedule time to spend with my family, and I schedule things for my significant other to do to get out of bed. Their depression lends itself to secluding in bed, locking away all the positivities of the outside world. \n\nIf I can keep the schedule paramount then it keeps our lives running. If I let it lapse then I wind up having to play catch-up more often than not.\n\n\nAlso, remember not to get too bogged down in scheduling time to set your schedule for the next day/week. The important things will show themselves. My schedule is almost exclusively, \u201cwork, food, playtime, family, news, school, maintenance, life facilitating behaviors, and life progressing behaviors.\u201d I might put a note next to food of what I want the menu to be so I check the ingredients.",

I got to 0 a few times when we started it, and then I picked him up, put him on his bed, and kept replacing him, impassively, until he learned this was *the worst*, and a force of nature.\n\nThe security lady stopped me at the Thomas event, saying she had seen that dozens of times today, and I was the first one for whom it worked.\n\nParents, be consistent for your kids.

He has been at the centre 'long enough' to know, but he doesn't. He has been there longer than the 2 year old, but it makes no difference. \nSchool rarely teaches anything on how to be an adult. On how to manage our time, how to regulate our emotions and a lot of parents don't either. But I'm not blaming the parents. They may not know that they have to teach this. They may think you just happen to know it as you get older but it doesn't work like that. \n\nI really think some form of material/course that is free should be made available to new parents. I don't have kids but I took a two year course in childcare and young people and also did a year apprenticeship in a childcare centre for 3 months to 5 years old and I now work at an early intervention centre where I was additionally taught behaviour management and other ABA strategies. The amount of things some parents don't know it realise is shocking, but it's not entirely their fault. When I did my course we learned child psychology, safeguarding (look this up if you don't know what this is. One of the hardest topics I've had to endure due to what I learned and the pictures I had to see), we learned nutrition, health and safety and pretty much everything else there was about children. A lot of this stuff would greatly help parents! But sadly it's not readily available nor free.\nSorry for the rant, thanks for reading.",

Do you know better than to do them, but still do them?  I'd guess yes, because *all of us* have bad habits we struggle with.  We know we shouldn't eat that fast food but we do.  We know we shouldn't procrastinate but we do.  We know we shouldn't lose our tempers in traffic but we do.  We know we should be more patient with a difficult friend or family member but we aren't.\n\nSo if you know better, but don't *do* better 100% of the time, why do you think a child with a fundamentally underdeveloped brain, volatile emotions and still-growing executive functional system is going to do better every time?   \n\nIt doesn't matter that they logically \"know better\".  You aren't teaching the rational part of their mind.  You are training the **emotional** part of their mind.  You are helping their rational mind exert more control by handling their emotions at a time in their life when that emotional part of their mind is exceptionally volatile. \n\nThis attitude that others just \"should\" do better and that it's not your responsibility if they struggle to do so, and meeting that challenge only with punishment, is an extraordinarily ineffective way to instill behavioral change.\n\nYour mindset is the punitive-authority approach.  The approach that commands, and then punishes if commands are not met.  Immediately resorting to believing in the authority over the child, establishing that they *must* follow your orders and then growing angry or doling out consequences when they do not comply.\n\nThis has been shown over and over and over and over again not to be effective in instilling long-term desired change in children.",

I think that, and I hate to be hard on my parents, I'm sure they did their best, but I think that they really took away a lot of my carefree \"fun\" years with excessive rules and controls.\n\nWhen you're young, you have the ability to sit around and play games without a care in the world, adults can't do that, you have to worry about work, and life, and all kinds of things. I just feel that kids should be given a little slack.

If the rule is arbitrary and the intent or reason is vague or undefined, you can shove it up your ass. Explaining WHY a rule exists is super important, and during that process you very well may realize that some rules aren't necessary and can be scrapped. If you're unable to articulate the reason for a rule in a convincing manner, then its no one else's failure.\n\nSource: I manage lots of people, and I would never expect someone to blindly follow a procedure without understanding why its important. I therefore have cut a lot of dumb procedures from our work that were only there because the old boss was a moron and implemented old school rules that he was used to without ever questioning if they made any sense. Like \"no cell phones out at your desk\" rule. Fuck that noise, all you're doing is making people hide it. Have your cell phone out all you want, but get your damn work done. If you don't get your work done I don't care if its because you were playing on your phone or doing your makeup or writing a memoir. The point is you didn't get your work done. \"No cell phones\" is arbitrary and disconnected from its purpose. It's a bad rule.",

Their parents tho? A WHOLE DIFFERENT STORY. I can get a kid to understand that homework is completed before activities, but parents will yell and scream at me for not allowing their precious baby some play time. My job was to help kids with their homework and have it completed, THEN activities. Some kids were so spoiled by their parents that they\u2019d cry and kick and scream to me, calm down enough until parent comes and then does it all over again for the attention. Then the poor 18 year old \u201cteacher\u201d had to be berated  and yelled at until the supervisor came along. Smh parents need to learn to parent before sending their kids out into the world.",

In order to learn what boundaries are, their parents have to set healthy ones and hold them to it. You don't have to be a dick about it, but like OP said, if I gave fair warning and you chose to mismanage your time, that's too bad kiddo.\n\nIn fact, pushing boundaries and learning these lessons the hard way a few times is a normal part of growing up. Your kids might be mad at you for a little while, but leave it be. That's part of the deal: you're a parent, not their friend.",

My mom would set an egg timer on top of the TV. When it dinged she gave us five extra minutes to save the game or write down a password. After that, if we were still on, she or my dad would hit the power button. I used to hate this at the time, but now I\u2019m appreciative that they did this because it forced me to go play outside with my friends and be active. I see kids today just holding cellphones lagging behind their parents or playing on them when they\u2019re out at dinner with the family.

They learned real quick that it is easier to keep a good attitude and not fight it since they are usually allowed to go back to the game when they completed whatever needed to be done.

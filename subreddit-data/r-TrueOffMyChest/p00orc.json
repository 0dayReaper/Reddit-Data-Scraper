    "postText": "Before I begin you should know that I love my child unconditionally. He is so smart in his own way, and has a generous heart. I know this. \n\nBut I also, sometimes... okay, a lot of the time, hate that this is my life. \n\nI hate the looks we get. When someone asks him a question then awkwardly realizes he can't respond. When he has a major, hysterical meltdown in a store and I have to sing and rock him on the floor until he calms down. When other kids realize he isn't as \"normal\" as he looks...\n\nI hate that he will probably never have a real friend. That I will have to fight for him to be included in everything. That his birthday parties will likely be adults/family only.\n\nI hate not being able to go to church without making sure they have an adult with training to be with him. I hate how hard it is to find adults to be with him. And that I have to be the one to train them.\n\nI hate that he will be my only child. I don't know that I can handle a second child with disabilities... and it's not fair to him if we bring a neurotypical child into the mix. It's not fair to the other child either. \n\nI hate that he has to be watched 24/7. I never get anything done because I am exhausted from keeping him safe while trying to give him room to grow and learn. \n\nI hate the appointments, the juggling of specialists and primary care doctors and trying to remember who needs to be told what. I hate having to sign a kajillion disclosures to share information, and I hate that even my husband has to ask me what all kiddo has going on.\n\nI hate that he hurts me. Yes, I understand the reasons: trauma and development and delayed attachment and frustration. But I hate that my baby boy, my darling child, regularly kicks and hits and bites and scratches me. \n\nI hate saying, \"Kind hands, please.\" \n\nI hate how much I rely on his tablet to occupy him. \n\nI hate when people say it's just a phase. Or all boys/kids do that. It's not true, and they know it. But no one is comfortable enough to say, \"that sounds like it sucks.\" Which is what I really want.\n\nI hate that being away from him takes so much planning and money. That we can't hire just anyone to watch him. It has to be an adult with training, or a respite provider (which is impossible to get), or a rare, understanding friend. Or my husband. \n\nMost of all, I hate that I hate any part of being his mommy. Because I always wanted to be a mom. And when we found out we couldn't have biological children, I was so happy my husband agreed to adopt. I knew it would be hard. I knew it meant raising a child with disabilities and trauma. And I worked my ass off to prepare for it.\n\nBut here I am. On Reddit, telling however many strangers that I hate being a mom to a child with disabilities. Because there is nowhere else I can go and be this raw and open about it.\n\nAnd I hate that our society is the kind of place where parents like me can't be raw and open. Because I already know some of you are judging me, or calling me a snowflake, or passing by this post because this sliver of my reality is too much for you to bear on top of your own stuff.\n\nBut I had to say it. Had to let it out because it's too hard to carry around on top of all the other shit I have to carry every single day.",

They're simply venting about the stress and struggle. And believe it or not ALL parents vent about their children regardless of mental or physical disabilities or not. \n\nBearing this in mind, Rule 4 is in effect. No attacking or insulting the OP. If you disagree you're free to do so civilly but name calling or insults wil be the end of your time here.",

Exhausted he was physically stronger than they were. She was heartbroken and guilty to put him in a group home. It turns out he is quite content there. He has fewer meltdowns than he did at home. When he comes home on weekends he keeps asking when he can go back. BTW, her educational expertise is actually autism so it\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t know the techniques to manage this. But for whatever reason, he prefers the group home.",

And I don't mean that they are better trained or anything. What they have is the ability to shed away all the emotional trauma that comes from working with the mentally disabled.\n\nI know this because I was a caretaker. I handled all sorts of things from screaming and fighting to attempted suicide. It was a heavy emotional burden while I was there but I had the secret weapon that parents don't have. I can walk away. There's no dread that their trauma was the rest of my life. So every day, I went home, and I could dump all of the emotional baggage they heaped onto me. Which meant I could start every day with a new set of emotional batteries. They can tell when their caretakers hate them, but there's no way for parent's to avoid reaching that state. They have no way to recharge. Even if they took a vacation, there would still be the knowledge of what's waiting for them back home.\n\nSo yeah, I would always advocate for a group home. It's the best way for parents to have a productive and healthy relationship with their mentally disabled kids.",

Most humans crave structure, another way of saying, *predictability*. Some thrive better in structured environments because there is far, far less spontaneity. In a nutshell, some may deal with  one  fire alarm a day in a facility, and one every half hour at home.",

As much as it may not seem like the case, individuals with autism and other disabilities can often pick up on the low-grade stress and anxiety they cause the rest of the family, and can grow frustrated that they are causing that stress.  They don't want to cause their parents grief.  It often hurts them to know they do cause their parents grief, and that they are unable to stop themselves from doing so.",

Remember autism is a sensory processing disorder so I can get overstimulated/overwhelmed by \u201cnormal\u201d things. This is what helps me with that specific part of autism. (I don\u2019t know the advice given to parents of kids with autism so I might over explain)\n\nHeadphones and/or earbuds. - I can block any sound that bothers me with headphones and even more with noise canceling headphones. I can also \u201cblock\u201d the world around me and focus on something I like. I love music, but he might like something else. \n\nAnything that can change or block a sense might help. I am more affected by certain sounds but he might prefer sunglasses to dim light or an eye mask. This only works if I have the power of choice. He is nonverbal but probably not dumb (I am assuming). He can probably put on fluffy earmuffs and probably will if it makes him feel better when he needs it. \n\nPicky eating: I am very affected by textures. I HATE the texture of tomatoes, cooked onions, cooked summer squash, most meat, eta. But I like the flavor. I LOVE tomato soup, as long as there is no graininess or chucks. I use a food processor to cut the cooked onion into a paste so I can add it to my favorite dips. The texture can be different with different cooking methods. I love steamed cauliflower but don\u2019t like roasted cauliflower. And he might be more affected by flavors or smells or appearance so see how that can be changed. \n\nUnderstand that I have an ingrained fear of trying new things because somethings really bother me. He might have developed that too. I literally almost vomited forcing myself to eat a tuna sandwich as a child when my grandma said I had to eat it before I could play. I don\u2019t think I was able to finish that sandwich no matter how much I wanted to play in the water. I am trying to change that fear of trying new stuff, but it is a work in progress. Honestly It is easier with desserts.\n\nNote: young children have more bitter receptors so bitter foods will taste extra bitter then they do to you. A small amount of salt can actually help block the bitter receptors so things taste less bitter.\n\nThe ability to leave a situation or room that bothers me. It might be obvious, but it is extremely effective. But since he is 3 and needs to be supervised, maybe make an area that is dark or quieter or whatever he needs. (Again might be obvious, but idk the advice given to parents of kids with autism)\n\nWeighted blanket. Feels a bit like a hug. Very calming.\n\nI wish you the best. I have a disabled parent who I have to help everyday so I know the stress of non stop caregiving. I wish I could move out, but my mom comes first.",

She doesn't have social skills and can't have an intellectual conversation or long sentence. The brain is half an adult and half 11yo, been three years since she graduated (online) and can't find a job that suits her and she's almost 30yo. She has only one friend that she barely see, always in her room and never eat with us since seven years ago (we are like a roommate), can't ask her to do something like cleaning kitchen, will refuse and get angry but she will ask us to do stuff for her. In the long run, she needs an adult by her side and that's eventually going to be me after my parents pass away. That's why I don't want to have kids since I'm going to have take care of someone else which is too much responsibility. Envy my other youngest sister who went and got married and planning to have kids without letting this case changes her view. While me 31yo, thinking negatively (worst case scenario) of having kids. I wish I could be pre 23yo thinking when I imagined myself having two kids by this time but my sister case changed my whole perspective",

He has [Childhood Disintegrative Disorder](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001535.htm#:~:text=Childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder%20is%20a,skills%20that%20they%20already%20learned.) - think dementia but in children. He went from being a typical kid to a baby trapped in a man's body.\n\nHe used to be able to write his name, he used to play tag, he used to say full sentences, he loved music, fashion and cartoons. Now he's 17 and I have to wipe him after the toilet, bathe him, dress him, feed him. He can only scream. He can't use cutlery. He'll never be able to socialise, tie his laces, or communicate verbally ever again.\n\nAnd I'm just his sister. The stuff my mum has to do is beyond anything I am capable of and it's some of the most exhausting, taxing, laborious tasks you can do. People don't understand what it's like to be a carer, if we say one negative word about the experience they assume we don't love them, when in fact we *do*. It's that love that pushes us through, but that doesn't mean we don't feel anything! We need breaks, we need someone to tell us it's going to be okay, and we need support too! But everyone forgets this.\n\nWhether you're ill or tired, or want to do something for yourself (more often than not) no one is there. We can't just get a haircut, or go to a Dr's appointment, or attend a relative's wedding. People take it for granted that we're expendable as they wake up when they want, drive whenever and wherever they please, book their holidays and go to the park on a whim.\n\nMeanwhile the likes of you and my mother wake up, get ready for the day and brace yourselves for intense caring around the clock. I highly respect you, and I hope you realise that to those of us who do understand, you're an incredible parent and what you do is above and beyond.\n\nMuch love!",

He had a big laugh at me the other week when he saw me get a fright from a spider :) others may have not made the humour connection though.\n\nI'd also say he is a dancer and a music lover, even if his 'dancing' involves him sitting down and swaying side to side. Would others consider that dancing? Probably not, but I'm aware of what he's doing\n\nI hope I'm making sense?

Really, he just crawled. I was there because my mum's a nurse so she was doing the vaccinating but wasn't there for long, and i was like 5 so he was kinda weird to me so i left. but i could tell his sister was just fucking tired. Shes younger than him by a good hunk of years.\n\nLooking back, its really depressing how he only had like 5 years to make friends and be a normal kid. If i, a good little Christian girl, couldnt muster enough balls to talk to him i know few other kids would.\n\nI have no idea where they are and no idea how he's doing now but i hope he's in good hands.",

However, most kids are moved around. Whether you've had a kid for 2 years or 2 months, they can be moved into a new home at literally a moment's notice. You don't get a choice in that. Foster care agencies make a great effort to prepare you for this, but especially for smaller children this isn't something that you can bet on.",

He was in a wheelchair full time when they got him but he\u2019s in his 30\u2019s now, and has been walking since he was nine. I used to babysit him to give her breaks and even those few short hours gave me mad respect for those who parented these children. It\u2019s not easy. I feel bad I\u2019m no longer able to give her respite (I moved across the country) because I know how hard it is for her to find someone willing. I\u2019ll admit, when my daughter was a toddler I got a little nervous how this six foot man, who was at the same developmental level as she was, would treat her. I always stayed right there with them and was pleasantly surprised how gentle he was. They\u2019d throw a ball back and forth and they would both beam from ear to ear. My daughter would say \u201cgentle\u201d if he ever threw the ball too hard. It was adorable. I might have been hesitant to get them together had I not known him since he was 6. I should reach out and see how she\u2019s doing. \n\nGood luck mama. Posting on Reddit is even better than screaming into a pillow.

He was wheelchair bound by 12 years old.  \n\n\nHis disease physically dictated every thing we did. Is the destination accessible(no stairs)? Are the tables high enough for the chair to fit? Are the restroom doors wide enough for the chair to fit? Will that chair's battery last long enough for day trip? Blah blah blah...\n\n\nThe emotional toll was also aweful. My mom should never have to console her youngest child because she is worried about when her brother will die. She should not have to console her oldest because he doesn't want to die.  Add the looks, stares, whispers....  burying him just shy of his 22nd birthday.  A big ball of suck all around.\n\n\nIts human to hate the situation. I loved my brother with my whole heart. I would not have traded him for anything but I would have traded his situation in a heart beat.  I would give anything to not be an only child as an adult, to have had more of a friendship relationship than just big brother/little sister relationship.  \n\n\nAnyone who judges you for this is damn lucky enough to not have been put in a situation like this.

            "comment": "Hi there, I think this is my frost reddit post. I'm the youngest child of 4 and my second oldest sister has severe autism as well as mental retardation (my mom unknowingly drank contaminated water twice which she was pregnant with my sister among other things) until a year ago my mom was with my sister almost constantly, and my family life revolved around her needs. She can't use the bathroom herself, feed herself, speak in full sentences, etc. One day at school I listened to a podcast from This American Life about a couple who decided to put their autistic son in a facility. I sent that podcast to my mom, and that began my mom's journey to finding a new living situation for my sister. I don't know your situation financially but I wonder if you could atleast look into your options. My mom spent 2 years doing this and thinking over it and was reluctant when the time came for my sister to move out, but that decision she made has truly made my family's lives better. My mom can visit her whenever she wants and my sister still comes to family events. My mom has sleepovers with her friends, takes walks, takes time off work for herself, and has even restarted her hobbies again\nThis kind of situation may seem impossible, or heartless, or over dramatic right now to you but I wonder if just doing some research every once and a while about how it could look like for your family would give you perspective on your living situation now. Regardless of what you choose for him, you have given him/will give him a lifestyle that he wouldn't be able to have if you hadn't adopted him. And most importantly you have given him a family. If you'd like to listen to that podcast I can try and find it for you.",

It sounds like it sucks and I hope you find some semblance of peace knowing that some of us know that it sucks. I don't pity you, and I don't envy you. I empathize with you. I know what it feels like to regret decisions you've made when you were in a different place, and sometimes wish you could go back and make a different decision even if it feels wrong. I admire your self-awareness. You are not a saint, you are not perfect, and it's okay to embrace that. Thanks for sharing this.",

But there are really rough times like when she cant sleep and decides the correct course of action is to wiggle around til she finds something to kick that will make noise and proceed to kick and cry no matter what you do or how you reposition her.   And when you try to help her sit up in your lap, she bucks like a horse and requires all of your body strength and constant maneuvers to keep her from falling into the floor.    There are hard frickin times.

And it\u2019s not as simple as finding others who have the same experience, because it\u2019s like a downward spiral.  You want to get away from it and feel normal (whatever that is).  \n\nWe have had some luck getting the behaviors better as he got older, but the path we\u2019ve had has been a very isolating one.\n\nLooking back, if I could tell my younger self how to prepare, I think having a therapist for my own mental health may have made things a little clearer.  \n\nYou are not failing, you have a very difficult situation.  My hope is you find some balance or peace, or get help with the difficult behaviors your child has.  Pay no mind to the outsiders on this thread, unless they have walked in your shoes, there is no way they can sense your anxiety and frustration, no need to argue.  Best wishes",

He was born normal and healthy,  but suffered an injury when he was 2-1/5 years old.   He's now 13.  I understand how you feel,  as I also hate that this is MY life.  I wasn't supposed to order oxygen tanks and supplies every month.   Endless appointments.   Recently he had spinal surgery.   Although I'm not alone in this,  his dad and big brother are a great help, I often feel like I am because his dad works 2 jobs and I feel guilty asking his brother to help.   \nI will never hear my baby's voice again.  I will never watch him run or do anything.   I'm forever grateful that he is still with us.   I love him beyond words and would do anything for him \u2764\nKeep your head up mama.  I know your son loves you and appreciates all you do for him.",

            "comment": "I understand.\n\nI will raise my son to bethe best version of himself he can be, but if I could turn back time I'd get a vasectomy.  My wife leaves the house for work because she just can't handle him, and I (sort of) can, so I work as much as I can from home.  The livingroom of our house always looks like shit because he just dumps stuff wherever.\n\nThe Coronavirus made me damn near suicidal because school was the only break I had from 24/7.  I have gotten fed up and been verbally abusive a few times just to get a nap in.  I know it's wrong but I can't get any personal space or time and it boils over.  What used to be cute imaginative play as a young toddler gets tiresome quickly now because it never advances in complexity.\n\nI cannot take him out in public for long because he gets violent when someone doesn't comply with his moment to moment desires.  I dread the horny teen years because, given his personality, I am almost certain he will force himself on someone.\n\nThe worst part is I know this is my life now, and for the rest of my life.  Eventually I will grow too old to physically overpower him and hold him away from committing violence on others.  My son will forever be a burden to the world, never understanding consequences are related to actions.  It's heartbreaking because he doesn't understand why he has to be decent to others; he has zero empathy.  It's just part of his brain that never developed.  He cannot understand why the world will not change to make the bad things he does become acceptable.  It's not his fault he is broken, and he understands JUST enough to know he is different.\n\nMy wife asked how people used to deal with this in the old days.  Yeah, turns out wealthy people had them committed,  and poor people would just let them walk into the woods.  The modern world expects us to be saints, not understanding what this is really like.  Any time I try to get relief or _help_ I am treated like a criminal for not wanting to be a perfect caregiving machine 24/7.\n\nI go to support groups and all the other parents are SO FUCKING WEALTHY.  They are baffled that we can't \"move stuff around\" to hire in-home help... not that we have a spare bedroom anyway.\n\nI thank the Sun and Moon schools are open this year.  My wife and I will finally get to spend a few hours a week with each other.  Life sometimes hurts for people like us.  All we can do is feel the hurt and let it pass through, trying desperately to ensure that hurt does not get passed onto the child, because it's not the child's fault they are broken.\n\nI'm tired.  I'm poor.  I haven't been able to really write new books under my own name for so long, just for hire crap... and it IS crap.  We recently bought a 40 year old motorcycle with a fucked up electrical system because insurance is so much cheaper than a car.\n\nI understand,  OP.  I understand. \n\nNow that we have vented it's time to stand up and fight for our child to have the best life we can give them.\n\nIt's not their fault.",

You adopted a child with seemingly severe disabilities, rather than letting him disappear into the system. Of the billions of humans who live, or have ever lived, that alone puts you in the 99th percentile of most compassionate/bravest/loving. \n\nI was diagnosed with Aspergers as a kid, considered severe but high functioning. I can seem cold, distant, blunt, and unappreciative. While the experience of any neurodivergent person is unique in alot of ways, here's some things I can infer with a great deal of certainty. He knows you love him. He wants to say it. He knows he can be alot to deal with, and he appreciates it. \n\nYou're allowed to feel things. You're allowed to be sad, angry, hopeless, or numb. You're allowed to have weak moments, and bad days. None of that makes you a bad mother. You're a human being who took on an unimaginably difficult task, and you do it everyday. You deserve support, and praise, and I for one think you're awesome.",

His developmental disorder also turned violent sometimes and my mom merely explained to me that 'he's sick so we need to be understanding of him.'

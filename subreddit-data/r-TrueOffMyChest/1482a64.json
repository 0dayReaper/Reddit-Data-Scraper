    "postText": "I (17f) have been hopelessly in love with a person who we'll call \"T\" (17nb). T and I talked over summer 2022, I'm not proud to say it but me and them did trade nudes I thought they liked me and I told me friend \"R\" who is a year above me in school about them.\n\nTelling R was a big mistake, in September-ish R and T started dating, I was so hurt and so angry. I hate seeing pictures of them together because all I can think is how that could have been us.\n\nSorry if my english is bad its not my first language.",

The person you\u2019re feeling for is *also* entitled to how they feel. \n\n\nI know it feels sucky and like a betrayal right now but I guarantee you, in 5 years it genuinely won\u2019t even matter.",

I have no real life friends and the few online friends I do have barely talk to me. I used to have close friends of many years online but they all ghosted me. I'm ghosted by every person I meet. I've long since given up hope to find a person who would give a shit about me. I also have serious trust issues. Life isn't worth living when nobody cares I exist. I think of ending it daily.",

            "comment": "Been there a lot. I suffer with chronic full body pain, anxiety, and depression, amongst other health issues, and it's so hard to get out of a depressive state when you feel like there's nothing good left to hold on to. I've started forcing myself to do more things, even if I'm in pain, and even if I feel low. Sometimes I wish I hadn't even have bothered, but other times I feel much better for trying it. The distraction alone is worth it. \n\nI've found since I became ill (8 years ago, at the age of 17) that I wasn't able to do half the things I used to. But over the past 2 years I've started to do more, and push myself to try more things. It may not be as easy as it was before, but when I do it, it feels like a massive accomplishment. \n\nI completely lost contact with friends because of my health, but that was more so because I didn't know how to explain to them just how bad I was. \n\nIt fucking sucks having chronic health issues, but we slowly learn how to live with it. It does get easier, it just takes a lot of time and effort. Unfortunately, we need to put more effort in than the average person just to go about our day-to-day lives, and a lot of people can't understand that. But you will find people who do - you just have to put more work into finding them.",

I used to be part of a a few very large communities. Most of my adult life I was disabled but when things got worse. They all disappeared. I used to be a healer. But when I needed their help. They all disappeared. I understand the trust issues. Even family just doesn't get it. And I don't really have that many . Everybody's busy they don't have time. And I understand. Just sucks.All extended family ghosted me. When I became so ill with something they didn't understand. I was able to heal from that. But not from the hurt that they caused. Still dealing with chronic illnesses. It's physically and mentally exhausting. And not having any empathy. Or connections with people. Makes it hard. I understand what you're going through. Even though I'm older. And at least I have my cat. You're not alone",

You sound pretty isolated. You only mention online friends, what about friends irl? You have to force yourself to go out and join groups/meet ups/activities where you can find people with similar interests and bind. \n\nOnline friendships are fine but there is something to be said for maintaining friendships outside of your social media bubble. I hope you try. There are people who care. Even if we don\u2019t know you. Because we\u2019ve all had those low moments in life but we overcome. You will too because you deserve it and you deserve to be happy \ud83d\ude0a",

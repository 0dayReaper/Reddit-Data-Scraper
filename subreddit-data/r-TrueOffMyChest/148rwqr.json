    "postText": "Just a couple of minutes ago my mom started to scream at me because I (f17)had an open soda in the fridge and she knocked it over while taking something out. She started yelling my name angrily telling me how I was gonna have to clean this mess because I shouldn\u2019t be leaving open drinks in the fridge. I told her I wasn\u2019t done with my drink and I still wanted to drink it but she told me that I\u2019m not supposed to put it in there. Then i had to clean it. Also yesterday she got mad at me because I didn\u2019t go to the store and and get chips for my sister. She then came in my room and told me not to ask her for anything else. My mom is starting to turn into a bitch and she\u2019s starting to piss me off everyday I hate living here. I\u2019ve been trying to avoid her at all cost. She\u2019s making me really upset and now I\u2019m crying idk how to deal with her.",

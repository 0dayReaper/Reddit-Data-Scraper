    "postText": "In my memories, I remember almost nothing. I barely even recognize that an event happened. I have difficulty with remembering sounds and voices, I can\u2019t feel emotions from past memories, and most of them are really muddled together.\n\nI hate how, in all I can recall, I\u2019m just a pair of eyes, with a vibe Like every memory is a dream. No emotion. No motivation. I want it to stop so I can improve myself, but it won\u2019t. It won\u2019t and I can\u2019t take those extra steps I need to be a better me because it\u2019s too painful to as a result. I don\u2019t know how to explain it, but it\u2019s just how it works.",

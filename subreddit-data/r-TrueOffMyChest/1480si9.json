    "postText": "Obligatory *I\u2019m on mobile*\n\nI (19F) was in a situationship (if you can even call it that) with a friend of mine, B(23M). He was cool n all, pretty immature for his age since he was a non-traditional student at my college, and we shared a lot of the same friends. We met through a school club and he\u2019s liked me since February of 23, almost since he first knew me. \n\nWe were in a talking stage for no more than a month, maybe the entirety of May? It wasn\u2019t very long, as I live a few hours from school and realized I didn\u2019t want to be committed to someone at the time. I pulled away early so it would be easier. \n\nDuring the time we were just friends, I was diagnosed with severe ADHD and high functioning autism. I have some special interests in video games and dolls and I talk openly about my interests if my friends want to hear about it. I felt like during the time we were talking, I was being treated like a child. I\u2019m not a child, I\u2019m a mature adult woman (kind of) and I hate being treated like I can\u2019t understand anything. There were also many times I had breakdowns throughout the semester and instead of just leaving me alone to cry like I asked, he would simply message me and tell me \u201cthings will get better\u201d which is something I HATE hearing from people, even if it\u2019s true. When I\u2019m upset, the best thing is to play music and just let the tears out and I\u2019m very explicit in telling people that. \n\nI was very clear to him that I was not looking for something serious due to issues I have getting over my previous relationship. I told him that I just wanted a little fling and that\u2019s it, he knew it because I was very, VERY direct with it. We kissed maybe four times, and never had sex or anything intimate, and we went on one date. Not to mention, half the time we hung out was at parties that happened at his house, in which he was barely functioning with how much he had to drink. \n\nAt the end of May, I told him that I didn\u2019t want to continue our talking and explained we had very different values - he wanted to always have deep conversations, and I greatly dislike them, I was only looking for a short fling, he wanted a long term relationship - these were, again, things I had told him when we began talking. He did not take it well and we did not talk for several weeks. \n\nWe went to a concert this past weekend with some of our mutual friends and he got drunk immediately upon arriving to the venue, despite the fact that we would be meeting the band at the end of the show and our friends tried to cut him off early. Today he blew up my phone with long messages about how he wished I had told him I didn\u2019t want to be in a relationship (remember how I said I already told him? Yeah), how he wished I had been up front about our romantic compatibility, and he essentially claimed that I avoid my problems instead of facing them head on. I talked to one of our mutual friends who was with us at the concert and they agreed that he\u2019d been acting super weird and had been a dick recently. \n\nI think I dodged a bullet. Our friends who have known him for longer are saying that it was a good thing I ended it when I did, as apparently he is an aggressive alcoholic and I didn\u2019t really notice. There were other issues that went on as well, but I\u2019m not sure I have the space for all of it, lol. Thanks for listening to my ramble.",

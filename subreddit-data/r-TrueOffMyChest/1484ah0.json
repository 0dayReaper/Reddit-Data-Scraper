    "postText": "So this just happened\u2026\n\nI(24f) am laying in bed scrolling on Reddit and my boyfriend(28m) has been playing xbox with the bros via his headset in the living room. \n\nHe just finished up games and came to lay with me and cuddle/goof around but when he did he knocked over my space heater and it burned my leg really bad. \n\nOut of pain, annoyance, and just reacting I yelled at him. \u201cOw babe\u201d then I said \u201cget the fuck away from me. Go\u201d. When I said it it was half angry and half just kind of in pain. Well he did get away from me. He immediately stood up, walked out of the room and swung the door to our room shut. Now I\u2019m laying here and feel bad. \n\nI feel like he is always really rough with me and will push it to the point where I get angry and/or physically hurt. Then he gets upset once I put my foot down or get annoyed. \n\nI think I\u2019m just going to let him pout this one out. My leg is on fire and I\u2019m not in the mood.",

This time the \u201cphysically\u201d was from my space heater tipping over so it wasn\u2019t intentional but still he probably would\u2019ve been pissed if his leg was burning. \n\nBut I agree. My therapist says the same thing. I feel like I try to communicate but a lot of times when I communicate he doesn\u2019t get it until I\u2019m angry or sad. \n\nRelationships are tough.",

    "postText": "This happened today and was a momentary blow to my confidence. \n\nThis guy I met on bumble had been chatting for a couple days. I am always straight forward with people about who I am because I don't want any misconceptions. \n\nI told this guy that I am not the typical \"insta\" looking girl, that I'm chunky/curvy/thick, and that I'm not fit. He said that was totally fine. \n\n5 minute later after he added me, he blocked me and unmatched. \n\nI know I'm not 22 any more, not skinny Minnie,  I've had a kid since then (he knew and was also okay with it). I'm 31 now, with a mom bod, but I'm still cute. I've got a tummy and some thunder thighs with a big booty. But not in a way that's sexy maybe? I don't know. I have my days where I'm like \"bleh, ew, my body, groooooss\" but most days I feel pretty good about myself. \n\nMen say they are okay with xyz things but once he saw my insta, something made him delete it. \n\nI am me. That is it. Nothing more, nothing less, just me. I'm glad the trash likely took itself out. He also kept trying to talk about sex when I changed the subject. Even though he claimed he wanted more than just sex. \n\nPeople are so confusing! I don't understand the dishonesty! Is sex THAT good for men that they can't contain their lies in order to obtain sex?! \n\nSomeone please tell me why people are so dishonest about who they are and what they want and why they care so little for others feelings.\n\nIt's so ... Discouraging..and I'm exhausted. How is anyone suppose to trust these days? Ugh.",

If they can't adjust thier expectations properly, then they probably wouldn't compromise well in a relationship. Which means, they would not have treated you like the Queen you are.

In other words, a curated, portrayed, false, made-for-social media \"image\".  When he saw that you were not what he was envisioning, he dipped out.  Honestly, it's for the best, so that way he wasn't going to be disappointed, and then disappointing, or even actively/emotionally mistreat you.  Sucks, but the good thing is that he told you who he was, and now you both can move forward without wasting any time.  Dudes can be dirtbags, this was a fairly clean break, all things considered.  What would have been worse?  This immediate disconnect, or a hurtful series of messages from the guy (proving his d-baggedness)?",

You should be a good conversationalist,if you are making this guy do ALL the work that kills interest really quickly. Also you said you have a kid, alot of men REALLY dont want to care for another mans children bc of the financial aspect and the implication of a situationship. That isnt a deal breaker for a relationship, its just a difficulty tweak. Find a good Man with strong values and a traditional base. Its hard but they exist",

I don't have a ton of money to go out all the time. \n\nIt's funny you say be a good conversationalist and not have them do all the work. 90% of the conversations I end up in I am given one word answers or it's like talking to an unsalted soda cracker. OR people that match with me, don't respond at all. I can't do boring conversations or boring people in general. Dating a boring guy for 8 months because he was nice and I needed nice but nice for him equaled boring. He agreed with everything I said, and never gave his opinion or input on anything. It was like talking to a walk.. I'm a decent and fun person to talk to so I'm told. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f ... But I digress...\n\nAs for being a mom, I'm always straight forward that I have a kid, I raise her with her dad as the co-parent and I would never ever expect anyone I date to help raise her or pay for things etc. But I can understand why guys would feel that way I suppose. \n\n\nAny whooo thank you for your input. Dating is hard regardless!",

Imagine doing that to someone face to face.  Then whipping it out.  We call this a crime.  Those dudes, I just block immediately.  Not worth my time or energy.",

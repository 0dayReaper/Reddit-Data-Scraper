    "postText": "\nThis is a throwaway so nobody I know can find this post.\n\nMy friend (Anna, 18F) has always had a boyfriend (Tom, 19M) that treated her like shit. In high school, he was in the yearbook and newspaper clubs, so he was always pretty busy. While doing tasks for his clubs, he invited his yearbook editor over so she could revise his pages and whatnot, but they had ulterior motives. They had sex, without a condom or birth control, and they had been flirting a bit prior to this. Anna was saving her virginity so that she could have her first time with Tom, who she also thought was a virgin. After having fucked his editor, Tom was no longer a virgin but kept it from Anna for 9 months. He kept promising her that their first time would be amazing and that they could have their first time together. Nobody on the planet knew the truth but me. \n\nA bit after this, Anna also caught him texting a girl that was a couple years younger than him. He would text her and delete the messages, and when Anna found out about this, he said that he, \u201cfeels bad for the girl because her parents are divorcing\u201d and that he \u201cdeleted their texts so that Anna couldn\u2019t see her name on his phone and get upset.\u201d He always had an excuse for everything. She took a shower at his place one day and when she got out, she caught him huddling in a corner and going through her phone. She has given him zero reason to go through it. She\u2019s never cheated or even looked at another man.\n\nTom was my friend for about 7 years before our friendship ended. He and I had some differences and we went our separate ways. His girlfriend, Anna, is now my closest friend due to us just somehow getting along really well. Tom is in the military and he is stationed about 20 hours away from Anna and I, so she wound up confiding in me because she knew of mine and Tom\u2019s past friendship. Tom treated me pretty badly when we were friends, but he also treated me like family. He made me think that every argument or misunderstanding was my fault, and he never took accountability for anything. This is how he treats Anna.\n\nFrom the time I knew Tom, he and Anna have been together. They got together when we were all 15 or 16, and I got to see Tom\u2019s side of their relationship. He talked shit about Anna to me on a daily basis, and he never seemed to really respect her as a person. I\u2019ve tried telling Anna how shit he is to her, but for some reason, she never listened. \n\nNow she is married to him. Tom\u2019s family pressured her a month ago to marry him so that she can move onto the military base with him and start a family. They\u2019re constantly arguing and fighting and Anna is constantly in emotional turmoil. Tom watches her location and accuses her of cheating when she goes out with friends or just goes to work. He\u2019s extremely possessive, manipulative, and sways her opinions so that she stays with him. Watching from a third party perspective is like watching a fucking movie. I feel horrible for her but she doesn\u2019t know what to do. Tom is always going out to other places but always tells Anna that \u201che\u2019s just in his apartment and his location isn\u2019t accurate.\u201d He seems to have an excuse for everything or he lies about everything that happens. He always turns the argument onto her to make her sound crazy and apologize. His words are so manipulative that it makes her rethink everything and she always winds up apologizing for his actions. He never apologizes. They have each other on Life360 and are constantly watching each other\u2019s every move. Tom\u2019s family spies on Anna when she\u2019s around and not paying attention, and he keeps her on a really tight leash. She can\u2019t even talk to male coworkers at her job. Nobody in Anna\u2019s life knows that they argue or that Tom is emotionally abusive. She has nobody to talk to. Her family loves him and doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s like behind closed doors. I have never seen a relationship as unhealthy as this one.\n\nNow that they\u2019re married, what can Anna do ? They\u2019ve been married for a month and don\u2019t have any assets or anything to fight over legally. She isn\u2019t in the military system yet and hasn\u2019t changed her name or gotten a social security card. How easy would divorce be ?\n\nTL;DR - My friend got married a month ago and her husband treats her horribly. What is the best way to go about legally splitting when they don\u2019t have any assets to fight over ? Should she leave him ?",

She's only stuck in that bad marriage if she allows herself to be AND if a kid gets involved it will make her situation 1000% more difficult. \n\nAn annulment will save her a lot of time and money. Once she's free of her terrible husband she can block him and his entire family and change her phone number. She doesn't need to listen to his apologies or his lies about how he'll change. \n\nChanging a phone number is an important step because a block only blocks known numbers, the hopefully soon to be ex-husband would still be able to harass her if she doesn't change her own.",

I have lived like this for three years with my ex and leaving him was the best decision I have ever made. Exactly like this - he was constantly tracking my location, acusing me of cheating and he ended up even hitting me for no reason. \nThere are a million guys out there, way better, please take it from someone that\u2019s been there. I am now happily married with someone that treats me amazingly and I never once regretted leaving my ex, even though it was hard.",

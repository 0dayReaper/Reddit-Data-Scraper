    "postText": "So I posted a thread about my annoying brother, and someone asked me why he and I (who are both adults) still live with our family. I explained that it works that way in Asia. It is pretty common for us to stay until we're in the late 20s for various reasons like our parents would get lonely, cost of living is insanely high for an insanely low minimum wage, and so on. But simply put, it is a cultural thing.\n\nAaaand I suddenly got downvoted, with some of them calling me immature for refusing to get out of my parents' home? What the fuck? I haven't even graduated in college, and in my country, even degree holders struggle to secure a job at McDonalds (which by the way don't even pay enough to pay rent), and yet you think it is immaturity not to leave your parents' home at 18? Because of what? Your sense of entitlement and sheer ignorance on other culture?\n\nBring your Western culture out of it. Unless you live in Asia, shut up.",

It's a lot more common these days for adult kids to stay \"at home\" until their late twenties.

And they told me they would start charging interest in 1 year if I hadn\u2019t started paying it off monthly. So I got a good job, paid my way to immigrate for that job, got an apartment, and started paying off what I owed them. I love that they took this approach and I love talking to my parents on the phone every weekend. No animosity. Covid has been harder living in separate countries, but none of us foresaw that. \n\nThey have specifically told me that if I really really needed it their doors would be open and that they might\u2019ve done the whole thing differently with a different kid (they only have me).

My dad always joked that when I hit 16 I would find my bags packed and waiting for me but that never happened, my mum would have never let it even if he was serious. I was desperate for some space though so I left for college when I was 18 (my sister is two years younger and didn\u2019t go to college) and moved in with a boyfriend shortly after. My mum cried. \n\nOff topic: he and I both had families with zero boundaries and no privacy in our homes so neither of us realized how much our families invaded our space. I had to move back home after we broke up for 10 months as I waited to be transferred to another country for work. It wasn\u2019t till I met my now husband that I realized how bloody invasive my parents were. \n\nNow when I go back home I have my mum banging on the bathroom door yelling: \u201cWhy did you lock the door?! I need to come in! You\u2019ve become such a weirdo since you married Adam!\u201d\n\nI had a year of living totally alone in a city Where I didn\u2019t know anyone before I moved in with my husband (long distance boyfriend at the time).

The baby boomer generation is also well known as being extremely arrogant and willfully ignorant to the fact that times have changed, that homes are prohibitively expensive, that pay rates are utterly inadequate and that their kids wanting to stay at home into adulthood isn't a matter of laziness but instead is a matter of survival. \n\nBut many baby boomers again, refuse to acknowledge that times have changed and are entirely willing to throw their own children out into the street to be homeless rather than let them live at home for a few more years.",

It's far from a scientific approach, but I've noticed that the families that demand rent or throw their kids out at 18 tend to be toxic to begin with. And then they wonder why their kids tend to go low to no contact. Maybe it's just where I live (admittedly quite liberal area) but usually it's the kids wanting to move out and have their independence. Most reasonable parents, from my observations, understand that the economy isn't as strong as it was when they are their age and seem to be cool with it as long as the now adult child is pulling their weight.",

The only thing you are \"teaching\" your kids is how do be at a disadvantage to the people their age who didn't get kicked out of the house. It taught me my dad was a selfish prick who really didn't care about me and it taught my niece and nephew the same lesson when it happened to them (except at that point I stepped the fuck up and started supporting them myself so they could graduate college. One has a degree in chemical engineering and the other in mechanical engineering, and they most certainly wouldn't have had the time for those degrees if I hadn't been paying for them to live with me.

My aunt (my dad\u2019s sister)  and uncle lived with my grandparents until my grandparents died, and their daughter and her husband built a second floor apartment in the same house so she could live with _her_ parents, too. There have been four generations of my family living in the same house, and the kids and grandkids who did move out live very close by. \nAnd I love visiting them _so_ much. My family there is really close and they get together all the time. They are smart, funny, patient with each other, and just all around great people. I guess no one really wants to leave that. I always have a hard time coming back, myself. But it\u2019s also really expected that you stay with your parents, so you can help each other out. They went through two world wars, a revolution, and Soviet occupation. No one had money, and things were very difficult for decades-and still are in some ways. People really needed-and still need-the support of their extended family. Plus the countries are smaller there, so people are closer to their families, anyway. \nMy family in the US is scattered all over the country. I actually spend more time with my relatives in Europe because of that. I kind of wish my American family was as close.",

It\u2019s a specifically very recently and only for a few generations tried it out thing\u2026 It is a very recent phenomenon. For most of history it was common to not only live with your parents but theirs also. \n\nBesides, taking care of your parents will never not be the cool thing to do.

In fact, it is pretty offensive to the parents, to have a perfectly good home to live in with them and you CHOOSE to leave and live with an outsider instead.",

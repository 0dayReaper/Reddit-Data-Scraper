    "postText": "Sit down and grab a popcorn, long history coming. \n\nLet me start saying that I know this problem isn't as hard or bad as many, many other's in this sub, but I'm being consumed about the thoughts... So let me contextualize things: \n\nMe (26m), my (26f) girlfriend, both living nearly each other (40min car, max), she now lives alone with her two cats, and I, for the first time, am moving to my own place. \n\nI'm an person that will do everything in my power to make who's near me, happy. I'm an solid 8/10. I always thought of me as the guy who people would love and want near (and it's true, it's hard someone that doesn't like me). Personally I matter A LOT about looks (both mine and other) and through therapy, learned that it's my way of seeing things and it's \"all alright\". I'm also in a transition period from a person who didn't make a fucking dime (we start seeing each other in this time), to one that makes a considerable amount now. \n\nShe, in the other hand, is the most profound person I ever met. She is SO ADVANCED that even I look like a child near her. Rational thought, considerably smart, really funny, partner for everything... It's a 1 in 100000 person. \n\nWe made 6 months dating last Friday (it's was also her birthday), she finally introduce me to her best friends (all girls) and we had a REALLY good time. \n\nShe loves me deeply, more deeper than any other person I ever meet, and probably will meet. But this is the problem: I don't love her the same way and intensity. And gets worse, it's all about her looks. She's a 9/10 on the inside, but for me, the outside is consuming me. She's a 6/10. If was inverted, a 6/10 inside and 9/10 outside, I would be considerably more happy than now. \n\nShe knows it. We talked about for hours and for \"my luck\" the problems I see in her, are the same she wants to fix. So it's all good, right? I wish. \n\nThese problems are easily solved with money and determination. But she doesn't have any. Money for her nose and lips and determination for her belly. I KNOW what you all will say: \"FUCK YOU! You're saying that will lose someone 9/10 on the inside, because she isn't pretty IN YOUR EYES on the outside? Your loss, champ\". And yes, I agree. I'm a stupid man that want someone beautiful on both sides. Plastic surgery it's a mistery and can go super good, or terribly wrong. And if goes wrong? I dump her? What a gent am I, right? In her own words: \"so if I suffer an accident and go on a wheelchair, or any other thing that makes me more 'ugly', than what? You'll leave me?\" And I didn't answered anything, but my silence was loud. \n\nHonestly, I don't have a point here, and if there's one, it's that I'm a bad person and even if I break up with her, I don't thing I deserve the \"person of my dreams\". \n\nAll hate is understandable.

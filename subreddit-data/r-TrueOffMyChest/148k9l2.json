    "postText": "Hello, \n\n  \nI (25F) am hard working and go to work to do what I have to do and mind my business. However, I've noticed that my coworker (male, probably in his early 30's) looks over at me at any given moment. I am used to the stares by now, I just don't pay any mind to them. However, whenever I am in the staff kitchen/lounge room, this coworker of mine will be there too or on his way to the same direction as me. Yes, I am implying that when he sees me on my way to the kitchen, he will coincidentally get up to walk toward this area too. When I look over to my right side (from my desk), he is always there; not in a creepy way, because his office is literally 10 feet away from me, to my right. Anyway, I usually don't start conversations with my co workers like that, i simply just say \"hey good morning, how are you?\" It is usually my co workers who ask me extra questions, to prolong our conversations. And this guy is no different. Every time we are in the kitchen together, 9 times out of 10, we're alone in there. And he will start telling me things about his girlfriend. Which is fine and I find it sweet when people bring up their significant other into conversation. It shows that they're in love (in my opinion; and I one day wish to have that with somebody) - I'm getting a little off track here.. anyways: this co worker of mine, he doesn't exactly flirt with me (Not in a verbally obvious way), but the stares he gives me, he also winks at me from time to time, checks me out, and walks in my direction almost every time I get up. You have to be there to get what I'm saying. So imagine this, I am in the kitchen with this coworker, I ask \"how are you, how was your weekend?\" and he will bring up his girlfriend to me all the time. And at this point it feels like he thinks I'm coming onto him in some way so he his coping mechanism is to talk about his gf. Meanwhile, i can care less about him in that way... like I'm not attracted to him in any way mostly because we are co workers and I keep things professional overall when it comes to the work place. Let me give you an example of a conversation between me and this co worker:  \nOne day, it was freezing cold and this co worker and I were in the same elevator heading outside. He started a conversation with me saying, \"going out to lunch?\" I said yes, and quickly followed up with \"are you going outside just like that? did you bring a jacket?\" I said this in a way of concern of course, but I wasn't saying it in a flirty way. Moreso a friendly way, because it really was 10 degrees outside that day. The next day, he came in wearing a jacket. I remembered what I said to him the day before, so I said to him: \"good thing you got a jacket on today\" and he replied: \"yeah, my girlfriend got it for me she said I would need one today.\" he then proceeded to talk to me about his girlfriend ; specifically about how she cooks, cleans, how she is very organized, has a regular job plus a growing business... He did this until I just said oh how lovely and that I had to get back to work. When I walked away, he was staring me up &amp; down like he always does when I walk around the workplace. And he repeatedly does this technique to me whenever we end up together in the kitchen/lounge room/elevator. It's very awkward. And I know normal people do this all the time, talk about their significant other to their co workers, or even talk about their kids if they have any. I'm not against that. And I wouldn't be writing all this if I didn't feel off about this guy. I guess I really just needed to vent about this. I get weird vibes from him by just being around him. But even weirder vibes when we have small talk on our free time and he talks to me specifically about his gf. Also, I hear him have smalltalk with other co workers, men and women alike, and he doesn't talk to them about his gf, at least not to the extent he talks to me about her.",

She's definitely trying to get close to you (not in a friendly way), and he's using his girlfriend as a means to do so. I can, without a doubt, say he would jump at the chance to sleep with you if presented with it. \n\nIt's obvious what's going on.",

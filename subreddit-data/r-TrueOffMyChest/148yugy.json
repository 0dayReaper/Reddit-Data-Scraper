    "postText": "Tacos do not make things better. For some context, a couple days ago, I posted that I found out my dad (47) is seeing my ex (19). I deleted the post because I figured maybe I\u2019m just overreacting and they\u2019re just really good friends since they work together. Admittedly, I have a really good friend I hook up with that I work with too. Sure, she\u2019s not my son\u2019s ex-girlfriend, but I just tried to tell myself that\u2019s all it is. There was a couple comments telling me to confront them. I thought about it and what I would I say, but I couldn\u2019t bring myself to. This is really the first time I\u2019ve seen my dad happy since my mom left in 2015. \n\nMy dad asked if I wanted to come over for a taco Tuesday dinner. I said yes thinking it would be just us or maybe one or two of his buddies. I get there and it\u2019s his truck and another SUV I\u2019ve never seen in the driveway. Can you guess who it is? My ex. Standing in the kitchen cooking with my dad. My jaw dropped to the ground and I just feel instantly nauseous. I left the kitchen and went to the living room with the dogs so I didn\u2019t have to see them or say/do anything stupid. \n\nThey finished cooking and he pulled out the chair my mom used to sit in. I didn\u2019t think this would bother me, but no one has used that chair since. None of his girlfriends after my mom, not even the one he got engaged to. Seeing the girl I thought I would marry one day being all lovely with my dad in the chair my mom used to eat dinner for years in just ruined the dinner immediately. Keep in mind it has been dead silent since I got there. Other than them whispering, there hasn\u2019t been a single word said. Being the little shithead I am, I asked my dad if he\u2019s \u201cgonna introduce me to his ole lady considering I don\u2019t know her anymore.\u201d I could feel both of their death stares burning a hole through my head. He replies \u201cwell, you know (name) already even if you pretend you don\u2019t. We\u2019ve been dating for 6 months. We didn\u2019t know how to tell you, but knew you needed to know. Please tell me honestly how you feel about this.\u201d I mean, how the fuck am I supposed to feel about this? I told him it made me uncomfortable and I can\u2019t think of her as my dad\u2019s GF and especially not my stepmom. It went silent for the rest of dinner until I decided to leave. \n\nSo, now I\u2019m laying in my bed at my apartment thinking how the fuck either of them think this is okay. Or how they think I\u2019m supposed to be fine with it.",

I pray they don\u2019t get married. Especially pray they don\u2019t have a kid. She always talked about how much she wanted kids. Like to the point that she was already weaning off birth control when we got into senior year so that she could be ready to get pregnant once we graduated. \n\nI also really hope she realizes that she\u2019s making a mistake. I went to text her after dinner and she\u2019s blocked me on every form of social media.",

Is that a person you want to keep in your life ? for me is wasnt. \n\nThey invited you around (ambushed you) and asked how you felt not because they care but because they knew at some point they had to face you. not because they care what you think. I highly doubt any emotions you express will top their \"love\" for each other. \n\nFocus on building relationships with people who care for you and cut out anyone who doesnt.",

    "postText": "I know this is hypocritical of me for posting this on a social platform but I don\u2019t have anywhere else to express that because people simply just don\u2019t get it. I have no social media besides Reddit and Snapchat. And, I hardly use either of them. I am growing increasingly weary of social media and the mindset of people that everything needs to be on the internet for everyone to see at all times. People are consistently posting their thoughts and opinions, what they eat in a day, all for the sake of becoming some \u201cinfluencer\u201d. Women all look the same with their fake lips and nails. Nothing is authentic anymore and it honestly is just sad and draining.",

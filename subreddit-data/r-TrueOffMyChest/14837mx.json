    "postText": "I want to tell the internet how awful I am.\n\nI tried to save my first love and only true love from me. I was so depressed. I could feel it coming before I knew its name. My love hurt for years and hurt deeply. A hurt I can never understand. \nI miss them every single day. There is not one day that has passed since 2004 that I havent thought of them. I love you since the day I said hello in class and you decided to be my friend.\n\nIll miss you forever and carry you always.\n\nI am so happy you are finally happy now. With a love of your very own who fulfills dreams WITH you and makes you feel seen/heard/loved/and special. You are all of that and so much more.\nI am a lost soul without yours. Thank you for staying in my life and allowing me to remain your friend.\nI cant wait to see all of the joys that find you. Or at least I hope I get to.\nYou saved my life more than once. The number I cant forget and the only eyes I have ever stared into that reached beyond this physical body have been yours. Ill love you always. Im going to start living with the joy we once shared. Because ever since I ended us, I have been without any of that happiness.\nIt was all lost.\nIt is time to take it out of the box.",

You're seeing them with rose tinted glasses. I'm sure they are great but there are other great people out there. Never live your life for someone else, especially when that someone else isn't for you. Respect yourself before you regret it down the line. You'll be good but take that step to be self aware.",

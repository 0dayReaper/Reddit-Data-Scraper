He gets mad whenever they come to me with a question, or there would be some misunderstandings where they do something he usually don't let them and I tell them don't so they don't get in trouble. Then he always says \"You're not their momma.\" I didn't know my dad changed a rule and then when my dad told me it changed, he said \"That's because you're always trying to be someone's mother.\"\n\n  Alright then, I'll let them do whatever the hell they want then! Except dangerous stuff of course. But if he questions why I didn't stop them, I'll just say \"I'm not their momma, remember?\"",

I tell the oldest not to mother her sister because I don't want her to be made into her sister's keeper and feel responsible. I also don't hold her responsible for her sister's behavior. Your dad can't have it both ways",

A lot of people want babies, not older kids. And those agencies vet the shit out of you, I've heard they'll drop you if you can't make a certain amount of meetings because of work, even if your spouse goes to the meetings. \nFoster care babies go primarily if you have previous experience as a Foster parent, and they still take forever to get. Also, most babies from Foster care are going to have major issues-health, development and/or mental, because usually they are traumatized, addicted to a substance, or their parents couldn't afford the medical bills/mentally handle the care required. \nOlder kids aren't as hard to adopt, but you still have to foster before you can be approved to adopt. And those children are also very traumatized, many times years of neglect and abuse of all kinds. It's not a walk in the park, and it's definitely not for the people who want a perfect picket-fence family.",

Addicts don't care that the money is to help their family. In their minds, it is just another way to score. 2) they thought they could straighten their life- or their spouse's- out with kids or relapse after having them and are too far gone to care. 3) they don't believe in abortion or just want another punching bag.\nThese kids were born when abortion was easily available, and in the state I was fostered in, abortion is still legal until after 6months and 6 days.

Their scent of baby skin, powder and puke makes me all gooey. \nEven cheeky kids, especially the way they roast you is (whilst doing nothing for your confidence) is refreshingly hilarious. Kids are awesome!!!\n\n\nMy advice? Become the best version of yourself, so you're able to comfortably provide for a kid(s). Kids are yours for life, they're a commitment. It wouldn't be fair to you or them if you were unable to fulfil your role mentally or financially. \n\n I don't want more than a couple...but if I was mentally capable or wealthy I would adopt. I would like to volunteer with disadvantaged kids though.",

    "postText": "23M, and my grandma has been unable to fully take care of herself since my grandpa died almost 9 years ago. \n\nIn that time, she\u2019s become pretty much a completely different person to me. He died when I was 14, so I was starting to realize that she relied on not only my grandpa but everyone in her life to cater to her. \n\nShe has put a serious strain on my mom, whose been taking care of her for the past few years now, essentially running a one person nursing home out of my grandmas house.  She has declined mentally in recent years as well as had hip broken along various other injuries.  The mental decline has been terrible tho, a woman who I remember working secretary as a young child, typing fast and sending plenty of emails, is now afraid to open her laptop and turn on her TV. Anything new or different is out of the question and I believe she\u2019s on medication. \n\nMy mom complains constantly about her and how she wants princess treatment She is fake, and she never shows affection to my mother, and I hate her for it.  My mom deserves better and it brings me to tears thinking about how she\u2019s had to live with this extremely narcissistic woman. \n\nThe last straw for me was one year ago, I got distracted while I was putting her coat on for her and she snapped at me and said \u201cwell aren\u2019t you so inconsiderate\u201d in the coldest most soulless voice is ever heard from her. \n\nI don\u2019t call her anymore, I just see her when I go home twice a year, half the time I spend with her I\u2019m sticking up for my mom. \n\nShe\u2019s old, and she was kind and loving to me my whole life because I was her first grandchild. and I don\u2019t wanna regret not being nice to her.  At the same time, I want her to get put in a home so that my mom can get some rest and live her own life. Any advice would be great.",

            "comment": "You're not wrong for not wanting to talk to her. She was kind and loving, but now she's just acting entitled. \\*But that's likely because of her mental health.\\*\n\nYou should get her a therapist. \n\nShe might get mad, so here's a better plan: You can request the therapist to do this. Invite them to your house. Ask them to sit down, make sure your grandmother is in the same room. The therapist would ask simple questions like, \"oh hi, nice to meet you, how's your day?\" and just talk with her, as if she was just visiting and wanted to know how ya'll are doing. Thus, the gramma might feel like she's \"understood\" and get better or smth like that. \n\nWorst case scenario, bring her to the nursing home. But don't give up on her, she's struggling mentally, and she might snap at little things and get angry easily, but she can't really control her emotions/feelings/thoughts/actions that well.\n\nHope it all works out though, good luck :)",

    "postText": "Using a throwaway that I'm deleting because I haven't been able to tell anyone else this besides my therapist, and I really need it out of me \n\nI was talking to my partner about some old friends and found myself at him, (let's call him \"J\") and the things he did to me.\n \n   J and I met through a mutual friend (naming him L) when L and I were 17 and J was 19. (He turned 20 during this) We were both playing in the campaign L was running. All seemed fine and normal until I switched characters. My original one was a male bard with brain damage who acted like a child, and he reached a conclusion to his story that I liked, so I subbed in a female human sorcerer (I feel like I should note here that I identified as transmasc at the time, I'm AFAB) J changed characters almost as soon as I did, and to one that he proceeded to use as a tool to get close to me.\n   \n   He was a warforged named \"Toy\", and that fucking sickens me, now knowing what he was actually used for. He could only speak telepathically, and would only do so with my character, the voice he used was attractive to me at the time and I told him that. I would get a bit giddy when Toy would talk to my character, I felt special and that's exactly what that sick bastard wanted. I'd look forward to the next session partially because I loved the \"bond\" forming between our characters, and it made me feel closer to J. It got to a point where our characters got drunk and had an affair, mine cheated on her girlfriend that night. We didn't RP the whole thing, but we played out the flirting and some foreplay before fading to black. What makes it worse is that Toy had tentacles and it was point-blank said that he used them on her. (Also why the FUCK did that warforged have tentacles???) After that campaign ended, his next character was a young tiefling girl who was making moves to befriend my gnome before another friend had become their \"primary bond\". \n   \n   This extended outside of DnD, that was just the start. The most notable and despicable thing he did was use my childhood trauma for his own sexual gain. I was abused growing up, and I trusted J enough to essentially tell him my life story, he knew all that I'd been through. A trauma response I have is to seek being berated and degraded if I feel I deserve it for one reason or another, and this was the last time I ever acted on it. I don't remember what got me to that point, but I was going around asking friends to insult me, and he was the only one who took me up, saying \"I'll put you lower than your place.\" It was repeating that line when my partner made me aware that I was being taken advantage of sexually and that adults preying on traumatized children to berate and insult them for sexual pleasure is A Thing\u2122. He proceeded to send me a paragraph just digging into every single flaw and insecurity I had, using my trauma and my trust in him against me. It sickens me that this man saw a sad, traumatized kid and chose to get off on it. He also sent sexually explicit memes and art to the DnD server. \n   \n   At the same time, L was his primary target. J and L were dating and only told me because our friends would \"Think he's getting 'special treatment' because he's the DM's BF\". L was also in a very abusive household, and relied on J for financial support. Those two put me in the middle of their breakup Discord call and J yelled at me so much that I went nonverbal for a week from the PTSD episode he triggered. Even after they broke up, J still had L around his finger financially. \n   \n   There was another friend that he groomed into a relationship right after his and L's ended (their title is N). N was relatively new to the friend group + DnD party and J snapped them up, too. I had managed to phase J out of my life since he stopped playing DnD and other games with us, he let me go for some reason. After he admitted to dreaming of raping N, I cut him out of my life then and there.\n   \n   This 20yo man was grooming 3 17yos at once, all sexually to some degree. I also strongly think he fetishized the fact that we were all AFAB and trans/nonbinary, or that he didn't see us as our identites as at all and just saw us as young girls, I don't know which is worse tbh. He got off on our trauma, all 3 of us, and he did it all under the noses of about 3-4 other people, including his best friend. And I know for a fact his friend would've stopped him because he was the same age as J and felt uncomfortable with jokes about him being attracted to N because they were 17. My friend didn't know that J and L were dating at a point until I told her last year, that's how good this man was at grooming us. \n  \n   I don't talk to L and N anymore, they turned out to be shitty people on their own, but I find myself wondering if they ever figured it out. Do they know he was grooming them? And I hope they can get therapy if they do.\n  \n   None of us knew what was going on, that this was wrong, that we were being groomed, and that's the point. You're not supposed to know, and I remind myself of that as much as I can. If anyone reading this has been groomed as a child, it wasn't your fault, never was and never will be, groomers make a concious choice to offend and that is something you're not responsible for. \n   \n   I'm 20 now and far from being the kid he hurt, and it feels good knowing that I've been able to grow from things I didn't truly realize were happening. Kinda glad that I realized this later because I'm too autistic about DnD now to be put off by it from my experience with J, plus it's become something really special between me and my partner :)",

    "postText": "I just have to get this off my chest. \n\nI hate my mom. She thinks she knows what\u2019s best for our family but she never sees herself as the problem. I am so fucking tired of her attitude towards me and my siblings, as well as her behavior of picking up a fight with my dad just to get what she wants. My dad\u2019s just the best and I never heard him complain of anything but last night was different. We were talking and I could sense how exhausted he was with my mom as she keeps disregarding my dad\u2019s feelings. He\u2019s tired of the way mom\u2019s been abusing me and my siblings verbally and emotionally. Sometimes my dad\u2019s away for work so we usually just stay with our mom thus the problems keep happening. I am so afraid to fight back and tell her how shitty she is cuz for sure she\u2019ll just be mad and idk what on fucking earth she\u2019s gonna do afterwards. \n\nI fucking hate her. She lacks self-awareness and her fucking attitude is just trash. Smh.",

He might be staying with your mum because \"it's better for the kids\" which isn't really true.\n\n\nYour dad needs to push back and protect his kids. Ideally he needs to leave and get custody, though this isn't always easy.\n\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this.  When you leave home you can cut her off, and that's ok.\n\n\nI had a horrible mother. I'm sorry you do too.",

            "comment": "Not sure how old are you but I\u2019m working through this myself because my mom is 100% a narcissist and emotionally manipulative. I\u2019ve been going to therapy and it\u2019s been life changing. My situation is a bit different than yours because I have kids now and she uses them to her advantage to impress people and thinks she \u201cknows best\u201d about raising kids\u201d and I\u2019ve let a lot of boundaries go between us. I\u2019m starting to put boundaries back up and boy is it hilarious to see her squirm. \n\nBut anyway, you should look up narcissism and related books - my guess is she likely has some narcissistic traits. Took me 35 years to figure it out so I say the sooner the better for you.",

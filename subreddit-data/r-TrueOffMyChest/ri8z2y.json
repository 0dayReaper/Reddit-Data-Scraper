    "postText": "UPDATE- I had several one on one talks with him before today, so he understood we were serious. He helped me finish shopping for all the other kids and got a stocking with some candy and little things. I still haven\u2019t gotten a refund yet, but mysteriously, 2 days after this, his Fortnite account was banned. Haven\u2019t figured out why or how that happened, but he knows if I do end up getting a refund, he will recoup some of his Christmas. \n\nHe\u2019s been very kind lately and in a good mood, so I\u2019m hopeful that this was a lesson he needed to learn. PS-he did get gifts from other family members, so he wasn\u2019t completely without on Christmas. \n\n\nWe have a fairly large family, four kids. Our 15 year old son spent $500ish on Fortnite skins/whatever without our permission. He will wake up on Christmas with no presents as payment for this. It\u2019s killing me inside a little since all the other kids will get gifts, but I also think it\u2019s an important lesson for him to learn.\n\nEdit-This got a lot more attention than I was expecting. Thanks for the awards! A couple of things:\n\n1) He has been told not to expect presents from us on Christmas. He thinks we\u2019re just threatening that, because we are kind of pushovers. \n\n2) This is not make or break money for us. I am working on trying to get a refund, but if I don\u2019t, it\u2019s not going to keep us from eating or paying rent or anything like that. \n\n3) This seems to be a very divisive topic. Either you think the punishment is fair and deserved or you think we\u2019re absolute assholes for even considering it. I get it. There\u2019s not one right answer. \n\n4) We did have a password for purchases, but he either guessed it or saw one of us inputting it at some time and memorized it. I now get a notification every time my card is used and the card info has been deleted out of the system.",

We were also on vacation when this occurred, so it made it just a little more fun. He racked up $500 between Fortnite and rocket league. We were able to contact Microsoft and have the charges reversed within a week. Since he did not have my consent, the tech told me they have to refund it\u2026 which they did. You might look into that.",

They never once cried or threw a tantrum in the store when they couldn't get something, cause rather than just saying \"no!\" Like most parents, I explained to them that I simply didn't have enough money. \n\n\nBeing honest about our financial situation has made them super generous (offering their own money when, for example, I've had to take a cat to the vet,) and has made them really smart with their own money. They are really good at saving, and good at spending their money wisely. They look at price tags, looks for sales and coupons etc..\n\n\nBut most importantly, being honest about our finances has driven them to want to do better with their own lives. My daughter is 18 and is in her first year at uni. She is the first person in our whole family to go to college, and the first one in several generations, just to finish high school. She sees how fucked I am, and doesn't want to end up like me, and I'm so proud, I could burst!",

Our go to line has been \"we need to make sure we buy all the things we *need* before we see if we have enough left over for things we *want*.\n\nMy mother was always far too open with me about our financial situation growing up, and she would tell me things like \"we might lose the house this month so no I you can't get new shoes\". I wanted them to understand we don't have much extra money without making them feel like their needs couldn't be met, but I always worry I'm not doing the right thing or I'm still telling them too much.

Because when I felt happy as a kid I couldn\u2019t escape my mother\u2019s worries so I felt guilty for being happy. Now I\u2019m a mom and while we have enough, we have to stick to a budget for sure.

I learned after though when my mom cried and honestly now I can't imagine why the ice cream truck guy allowed that. \n\n\nEdit Though that did teach me seeing my mom so distraught and not knowing what to do.\n\nEdit for anyone who is curious these are what I'm talking about. Also I feel like buying these is technically some kind of welfare fraud considering selling your food stamps then and now is a big no no. \n\nhttps://www.ebay.com/itm/114714380511",

She bought 580\u20ac worth of skins and what not. My friend was understandably devastated and called me crying and I could hear her puking from panic. I helped her contact Sony customer support and explain the situation. Customer support answered and said that unfortunately this kind of stuff happens all the time, they were really understandable and promised to fix the problem. If I remember correctly they were able to get back 560\u20ac of the money, the remaining 20\u20ac could not be refunded for a reason I can't remember.\n\nSo OP, try emailing the appropriate customer support before you throw in the towel :)",

You go to school so you can learn how to learn and make decisions and balance social emotional feelings.\n\nI now hope you understand teenage logic and why it\u2019s so conflicting with adults and why we see teens as dumb. Basically, they are learning how to know better, rather they do know better but they are learning how to make decisions better.\n\nEDIT: For the extremely curious https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED570880.pdf\n\nAlso\u2014this by no means justifies the 15 year old\u2019s action.

Hot EF is for decisions that need to made in that exact moment; I just got slapped in the face my some random person at the bar, how will I react to this? \n\nDrugs and alcohol are bad for your EF, relying on substances to suppress emotions rather than deal with them. Planning and mindfulness is good for your EF, understanding your values and remaining true to them. \n\nThis is a relatively new science. Most teachers who have a curriculum around social emotional abilities is addressing this for their students. However, if you\u2019re like me who graduated before 2013, then we never got a hint of this in school.",

But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s realistic.  Your son is also not an impressionable little toddler who will think Santa hates him or something. He\u2019ll understand the cause and effect here, and he\u2019ll become a better person for it.  Yes he\u2019ll be grumpy this year, but he\u2019ll grow up respecting you and your decision and probably won\u2019t steal again.  It kinda sounds like you\u2019re planning on talking yourself out of it, though, so do what you will.",

Your 15yr old is actually stealing from you and that\u2019s that. \nChildren want to be parented, that\u2019s why we are here. Children Never want their parents to be their friends. No matter what the parent thinks. Children thrive on structure and look to their parents to provide this. \n\nI know, I was one of those kids.  We were low class, My life was screwed up, my mother always gave me what I wanted as much as she could. What I always wanted was her to be my parent, not my friend. I didn\u2019t want her to tell me to punish myself or that I knew better. And just give me my way. I always wanted her to love me enough to show me what is right and wrong. I always wanted her guidance not just companionship.\n\nI\u2019m 35yrs old and she\u2019s still my friend. \n\nYou want to feel sad? Feel sad for the little boy who is acting out and testing you Constantly to see if you actually care enough to parent him. \n\nI promise you, if you and your husband do not stand up and parent him now at 15, someone will. That someone will probably be the law.\n\nEdit: THANKS For the rewards!!",

She didn't want to be like her parents so she gave me too much freedom. She kept joking saying we were like sisters/best friends/roommates. She wouldn't punish me and would tell me to just reflect on what I did. It got to the point where I would get so depressed getting a report card because I knew she wouldn't look at it. I started actively asking her to look at it (even if my grades were bad) and I'd put it on the table in the kitchen and keep reminding her about it. She'd say \"Why do I need to look at it? You'll tell me about your grades and how it's going in class anyway.\" I honestly wished I could feel the stress and worry all my other classmates felt about getting a report card back and having to bring it to their parents.\n\nI remember wanting a parent so bad and she just would not parent me. She just wanted to be my friend. She'd tell me inappropriate things like things she'd do with guys and ask me for advice or force me to go clothes shopping with her and pick out all of her clothes. I hated it and I still feel like I don't have a parent to this day.\n\nOP PLEASE parent your kid. It might seem hard and like they don't love you, but for the love of god please do it. They will thank you in the end.",

Decision-making is an essential life skill that we have to use all day, everyday.

I've had more weapons pulled on me by  other service members who were having a mental break down, than by enemies overseas while deployed.

Not $20 off your dresser, not a few bucks for fast food, but $500!\n\nI\u2019m a 90s kid so times have changed or whatever but I didn\u2019t even dream of doing anything like this as a kid because I knew my Xbox/Computer would have been sold, car privileges taken, mowing/raking all the neighbors lawns (not paid, btw, my parents would have just called and said \u201ctheincrediblena is on his way, he is graciously going to be taking care of your lawn for the next few weeks\u201d)\n\nI don\u2019t know how to describe it, but the worst part of it all would have been that my dad or mom would have just expressed how disappointed they were, and that would have just torn me up inside. That\u2019s when I knew what I did was bad and really changed my behavior.\n\nI suppose all this is to say that I don\u2019t think your kid appreciates the gravity of this (and might even be enabled by their friends who might be telling them it\u2019s not a big deal) but I would use whatever your next actions are to correct this very quickly and set a new precedent going forward. I\u2019m not a parent but I can tell you that as an adult I think back to some of my misdeeds as a kid and 100% respect my parent\u2019s responses.",

Does he talk in this same condescending manner to all the adults in his life?  \n\nI agree with other posters it\u2019s sounds like you have been way too lenient with this child and it\u2019s going to take a dedicated effort to fix it in the limited amount of time you have left before he is an adult. \n\nI would recommend getting a small NOT PORTABLE safe to keep your credit cards and any cash or jewelry in. I would suggest a keyed lock on your bedroom door but sounds like your kid would likely find the key.  If he hasn\u2019t already done it next he will take the car. \n\nIs he stealing from his siblings too as in have you asked them?  And how are their attitudes towards you?\n\nI believe in most countries children are entitled to clothing, food, shelter and education. They deserve love and that includes appropriate discipline.  If he continues to act as you have apparently allowed to go unpunished in the past perhaps he needs his lifestyle adjusted. \n\nSell the gaming system. \n\nNo allowance/spending money until you are paid back by him (not from the Microsoft if they do refund the charges).   And I would consider based on his attitude he be made to pay back double the amount he stole as evidence there are costs associated with stupid decisions. \n\nOnly electronics usage is for school and in a public area of the home where can see his activities.  \n\nI wish you the best of luck in turning this situation around.",

As long as you are taking steps to prevent it from happening again, you're good.\n\nHave you spoken to him to figure out why he did that though? Sure, it's good to reinforce the lesson that there will be consequences for his actions, but I think it's a lot more important to identify the underlying issue that led to the decision and address it. I don't know your kid and am not going to make any assumptions about his reasoning, but if it comes down to something like impulse control, money management, or unhealthy gaming... Those can turn into pretty serious things if not addressed early.\n\nMy kids are a bit younger, but whenever something serious comes up I remind them that there will be consequences for breaking rules, but also that I hope they don't choose to follow the rules to avoid punishment, but instead because it's the right thing to do.",

    "postText": "i\u2019ve had social anxiety for most of my life, i\u2019m introverted, i\u2019m an only child and i had strict parents. so i was very undersocialized during my childhood, never had a sleepover or went to a party, played with the neighborhood kids, dated, etc. luckily i managed to make close friends at school, but then i moved to a different country after high school. started off commuting to college and then it went online during covid until i graduated, so no friends were made there either. i used to be okay with that because i was happy with the level of social / emotional support i got from my mom and my best friend. but now my mom has died and my relationship with my best friend has ended. now i\u2019m 22 and i have no friends and no romantic/sexual experience. when i work up the courage to leave my house i have to go alone to movies and concerts. i have no idea how to make friends and i don\u2019t even know how to talk/flirt with people, it makes me too nervous, even on dating apps. and who wants to date a 22 year old that has no friends or hobbies and can\u2019t make eye contact let alone be intimate. i\u2019ve learned to improve at small talk and made acquaintances but it never goes beyond that. idek how to move beyond surface level conversations in this culture (canada), people are very polite but it\u2019s shallow and it never goes beyond small talk or necessary talk for school/work projects. i have no social life and i feel so pathetic and lonely sometimes. i\u2019ve had as much social experience as your average 13 year old and sometimes i think i\u2019ll never be able to catch up enough to be \u201cnormal\u201d. it hurts that i never even wanted to find new close friends but the 2 people i relied on are now gone so i have to make new connections, but it\u2019s so difficult. i don\u2019t even know if i\u2019m asking for advice, i\u2019m just frustrated and needed to get this off my chest. thanks for reading.",

There's nothing I can tell you here about making friends that you couldn't find in a 2 second google or youtube search.\n\nOvercoming your social anxiety is easier than you're making it. Simply put, you just need to not put so much pressure on your interactions. There's no specific script or one-size-fits-all advice for that. Just talk to someone like they're also nervous and socially anxious. If it's awkward then it's awkward and you'll learn to do better with the next person.",

Your mom just wants you to be happy, lets try to get there.\n\nI am kind of working on the same things. I too went to study in a different country just before the pandemic. Not the best of times. It sure as shit made me way more anxious and a hermit. I also go to places alone. So what? If I want to go get coffee on my own, its my own business. Its awkward, but I try to do something every second weekend.\n\nMaking friends is definitely not easy. I've had this \"acquaintance curse\", where I can talk usually (if not too many people are there), but I will never manage to get anyone's contact info, or to set up some new activity later. Its like, yea, I exist in that social thing, but afterwards no one will even remember that I was there. Still working on that.\n\nOne thing about initiating \"deeper connection\" that I recently learned is that these are built through vulnerability. If people don't initiate more in depth conversations, you must do it yourself. Of course, for anxious people thats like a triple problem lol. Small steps is the way.\n\nPerhaps a dumb suggestion, but what the hell: mate if you want \"conversation practice\" feel free to dm me.",

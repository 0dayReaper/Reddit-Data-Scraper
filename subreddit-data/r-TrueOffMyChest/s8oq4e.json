    "postText": "\nI'm feeling numb and so confused right now and need to get this off my chest.\n\nWe've (both 30s) been married for 3 years, no major fights or disagreements and my discovery happened about 2 weeks ago. I'm in utter shock that I sometimes forget this is really happening.\n\nTurns out he's been sexting this 16 year old girl for 3 months now. I saw their exchanged texts on fb and I did some digging by looking at her facebook profile she's 16 asian american. Now I don't know if he knows her outside of facebook because really all I know is some little info but I'm burning inside afraid of the confrontation and how it might go. Not only am I devastated over the fact that he's potentially cheating but also the fact that she's a minor. I'm lost on what to do or who to tell or how to process this. I do not think this is a forgivable thing for me to move past even if he comes up with an explanation for this.",

            "comment": "My sister's husband was in the same exact situation. She's foolish though, she believed him when he said he'd stop and was just being friendly. It was their neighbors daughter. He talked his way out of it like he was being a mentor. And she let it go because he said he'd stop. And then obviously he didn't. And then the girls parents found out. And then my sister's door was being kicked down by federal agents and they took all the computers and phones in the house. Everything. It was nuts. It's happened while my mom was visiting them. They sat them in the living room while agents searched the house and took him into custody. The chats were sexual. She still forgave him. They're still together. We don't talk to her much anymore. \n\nSo my advice is be smart. Do what the other posters say and get a lawyer immediately. Or you could be charged as an accessory since you know about it. I promise her parents will eventually find out. Get ahead of this before your door is kicked down by men with badges.",

We talked for a couple of weeks or so. We did the equivalent of sexting, but on the phone. He said he wanted to meet me. He came to my house when my parents were out, and I saw him get out his car. He was much older than I thought, so I called the cops. It turned out that he was in his 40's and married. I don't know what happened after that with him. They didn't arrest him. Every now and then I would see a car that looked like his circle the block at night. It went on for a few months. I wasn't sure if it was him or not, so I didn't call the cops. Looking back, I should have called them. Definitely call the cops on him. Who knows what he might do next. I am so sorry that this happened to you. I can't imagine what you are feeling, but you need to protect this girl from him.",

I was 13 at the time, so honestly, idk why they would send me there. I was at a very impressionable age, I likely could\u2019ve picked up some other criminal habits from the rest. I definitely think it\u2019s unfair to have that law, especially if it shows up on someone\u2019s criminal record. I\u2019m autistic, so along with having gone to juvy, who would hire me? In this world, I wouldn\u2019t stand a chance.",

For instance, even though the age of consent is 16 in my jurisdiction, it is illegal for an adult to have sex with someone under the age of 18 if there is more than a 36-month difference in age. Laws are often written this way to protect people who are underage from being taken advantage of by adults while avoiding criminalizing sexual behavior which might occur between two similar-aged teens.\n\nEdited to fix an auto-correct error and to note that my jurisdiction has recently changed this period to 36 months. My jurisdiction generally seems to default to considering people this much older to be in a position of authority.",

He will lie. \u201cDeny until you die\u201d was my ex\u2019s strategy. \n\nGet an attorney. Do what they say.  I didn\u2019t listen to mine at first. Don\u2019t be dumb like me; it\u2019ll cost you. \n\nScreenshot the hell out of what you find. Save it somewhere he doesn\u2019t have access to. Once he knows you know he will try to erase everything. \n\nGet copies of everything you can. Bank statements, mortgage, loans, 401k/retirement accounts, phone bills, income statements, check stubs, credit card statements. This will come in handy later when settling assets. \n\nFind a good therapist. It needs to be one that you click with. Don\u2019t feel bad if they don\u2019t mesh with you, keep meeting therapists until you find someone that works. \n\nDo you have kids?  Get them a good therapist too. The whole process is a lot more complicated if you have kids. Until you know the extent of what he\u2019s done you\u2019ll probably want to keep them away from him. I got an emergency order pretty easily once my ex was arrested. You\u2019ll rely heavily on your lawyer for direction here. \n\nWork with your attorney to form a plan to inform the police. Please don\u2019t skip this step. I know this part is hard but if you stop this relationship I promise there will be another girl. He won\u2019t quit. \n\nPM me if you have questions; I\u2019ll help as much as I can. \n\nI promise it\u2019s better on the other side of this.",

If they've only been married three years -I mean yeah they could have kids older than than that but a 3-year old is not going to need therapy for this. That can come.later, not a priority. (I don't know where you are but where we are is extremely difficult to get any appointments with a therapist. At all. Let alone if you want to meet one in person because virtual just doesn't work. I have been trying and trying to get my son into therapy and they're booked out till mid March. There are no as-needed options.)\n\nAnd those are the ones that actually call you back. I can't tell you how many times I have called and emailed and asked about available appointments. There aren't any.\n\nOtherwise, yes. Document and seek legal advise, you will need it. If you have the time and energy, (make it, it is important) speak to several attorneys. Their experience is invaluable.\n\nDon't  just pick one from an ad or a referral. Meet with them and ensure they understand your situation, and are able to advocate  and fight for you. I know from personal experience- not all attorneys are able to keep the fire in their belly to fight for you.And yes, it matters.\n\nI had exceptional, experienced attorneys ( two!!! I needed TWO for my divorce and custody because of stupid county laws) and although they were both good, they weren't good enough. They under estimated a narcissist who was his own attorney and outplayed them.\n\n Beware. Research. Good luck.\n It's a process and it takes time..\n\nWith that said you need to handle this adult-to-adult. It is not okay and you need to cover your bases. Confurm.Confront.  Move on.",

If he is capable of what he\u2019s currently involved in he may be capable of causing you harm. Please do not confront him at all. Do not be by yourself around this person any longer.

We\u2019re here for you, OP. Truly.\n\nFinal Edit (I think): one more thing\u2026. There are quite a few comments about age of consent and whether or not it\u2019s legal where you are. That is why you call a lawyer first. You don\u2019t need to add one more thing to your to do list like researching the law.

This is not going to end well for either of you one way or another. After you get your side of things in order, report him to the cops, if the lawyer doesnt do it first.\n\nEither she's gonna slip up and the parents find out, he gets thrown in jail and leaves you with more legal headaches as separating and divorcing will be difficult, and you get hit with the mark of shame. Then there's the fact he's grooming and preying on a teenage girl, and needs to be dealt with. This is likely not his first time, either. \n\nA friend of mine found out her deceased ex was a pedophile and had been keeping it on the down low for a long time. \n\n\nThis isn't your fault, and I am so sorry you have to encounter this. Especially someone you thought you could never think of being angry at and having out of your life.\n\nBut you need to at least get him out of your life and even just as importantly, away from that girl as soon as possible.",

You absolutely must report this - for her protection and your own. \n\nAre you able to see on her Facebook any contact names of parents or other adult relatives? If so, I recommend reaching out unless the police tell you otherwise. Either way, do not let yourself be potentially liable.",

Print out info showing what is in any financial accounts you have, and talk to a lawyer and ask what you should make sure you have copies of, do this before you confront him. If you have any heirlooms from your side of the family pack them up so it\u2019s easier when you want to leave, unless he\u2019ll notice, then just make sure you have a list of YOUR personal items that you want out of the house if you end up moving out in a hurry, this way you won\u2019t leave anything behind. Think about what wedding gifts you received, he doesn\u2019t get to keep all of them.  DO THESE THINGS EVEN IF YOU DECIDE TO TRY THERAPY. This way you\u2019ve got you\u2019re ass covered before he can destroy anything that you might need eventually. I would see a lawyer, then show evidence to the police, then when the police have confronted/arrested him you can confront him. If the police won\u2019t do anything then after you see a lawyer, give the girls parents a heads up to what\u2019s going on, before their daughter can delete texts from him.",

    "postText": "Kinda feeling like my world is falling apart. I\u2019ve been friends with \u201cS\u201d for the better part of two decades. Our parents were friends and we were born 11 days apart, so we\u2019ve been spending time together from the moment we were brought home from the hospital. Over the past few months he\u2019s noticed back pain, a cough, and shortness of breath, and after a CT scan to diagnose a nodule in his chest cavity, they discovered a large lymphoma encasing his lungs, heart, and airway. He spends 4 days a week getting treatment. Secondly, my girlfriend of two years (the first girl I ever felt I loved) just dumped me, claiming she wasn\u2019t happy anymore and didn\u2019t see it working out into marriage, so there was no point dating. I feel like shit knowing she wasn\u2019t happy for the last few months and I was oblivious, but it hurts like a cunt to have no one to tell you love at night. Just venting idk. :/",

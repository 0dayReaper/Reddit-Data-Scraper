A lot of the time family keeps bad things quiet until the worst part has blown over.  It\u2019s not a great way to cope, but it prevents them from spreading more worry. \n\nAlso, maybe your brother wanted to be the one to tell you. \n\nI know that this is difficult but I hope my sharing these ideas made it a little easier to move forward. \n\nAll the best",

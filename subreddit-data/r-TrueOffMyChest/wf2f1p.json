    "postText": "I. Am. Livid.\n\nThe only person I have had sex with within the past 5 years has been my wife. I thought I had a bladder infection or UTI, and scoffed when my doctor thought it was chlamydia. Well, here we are. I got the test results yesterday and I have chlamydia.\n\nDecided to start snooping and it didn't take long to find the text messages between her and her boy toy. My guess is she doesn't even know she had it as well. She thinks I stayed up all night working, but little does she know I've already emailed her little lover boy's wife all the text messages. I warned the lover boy's wife that he's been sleeping with an infected woman and to get herself tested. I'm still deciding how to process this all but wifey's going to wake up to my positive test results and the messages of her infidelity.\n\nThe sun should be coming up in the next hour or two, and probably will be the end of this marriage.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nUpdate:\n\nI'll make a longer update eventually. I didn't confront her that morning. Boy toy's wife ended up responding to me and she has not confronted her husband yet either. I'm getting my legal bases covered first.",

First step on that one is getting tested and getting healthy. That guy is a disgusting idiot and your soon-to-be ex fell for that.\n\n\nOP's situation and his initial plans (get a lawyer, don't say or promise a damn thing to anyone unless your divorce lawyer says it on behalf of you) seem as solid as they can be thus far, but man, this is a whirlwind of HELL.\n\n\nWishing you the best, OP!",

            "comment": "Funnily that chlamydia diagnosis will be key. If he's positive too (which he will be) - you've created phsycial evidence that they met &amp; had physical contact - confirming adultery, which will be very nice in the divorce hearing.\n\nEdit: \"You may need to attend Court\u00a0when one of the parties does not agree with the divorce going ahead and defends the divorce. When a divorce petition is issued by the Court, the respondent (the person receiving the divorce petition) will be asked whether they intend to defend the proceedings.\" \n\n\"In the UK,\u00a0you can only cite adultery as a reason for divorce if your partner has had sexual intercourse with a person of the opposite sex.\" \n\nSo yes. Proving they have had physical sex is important. It may not effect the judge's decision - but it's certainly a point you will want to make. Unless of course this is US based, where the rules vary from state to state. It is still a point worth making because of the nuances attached to cheating - in this case he can directly prove sexual relations &amp; that can become damaging.\n\nAnd yes - divorces can go to the courts if things get messy. Don't ever let anyone tell you different because they are either lying or ignorant.\n\nAlso important for Prenuptial Agreements as cheating may void it - but that is dependant in the preup itself. This is proof of sexual relations - which will almost ALWAYS void a preup. \n\nSo to all the smart arses in the comments, do your research.",

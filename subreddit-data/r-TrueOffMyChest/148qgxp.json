Don\u2019t let your insecurities stop you from these wonderful connections. Just because you don\u2019t like how you look, doesn\u2019t mean they feel the same \ud83d\udc95",

People that genuinely love and care about you do not see the flaws that you fixate on. And if they do, they aren\u2019t your people.\n\nJust glad I could help you and I hope when you meet up with all of these people, you have the best time and make awesome memories.",

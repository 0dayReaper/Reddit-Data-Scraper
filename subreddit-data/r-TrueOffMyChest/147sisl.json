Noone is excited to see me, im used as a way to make people feel better, my own family doesnt love me anymore, i used to wish i was dead, like i never put anything negative into anyones lives, im addicted to marijuana and hate it. i cant figure out how im gonna live with myself. any advice prob wont work and i prob wont check this again. im sorry for bothering everyone on this sub have a great day",

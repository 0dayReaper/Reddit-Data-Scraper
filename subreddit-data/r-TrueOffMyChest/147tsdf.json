    "postText": "Coming to terms with the fact that Im not who I thought I was. My behaviour over the last 10 years has been honestly self sabotaging and destructive and my addiction has taken control of everything good in my life and I\u2019m on the verge of loosing it all. I\u2019m back in recovery and I\u2019m committing to my meetings, iv reconnected with a few friends from rehab and my old sponsor, but if I\u2019m honest with myself I act like a really horrible person. Iv hurt so many people around me because I refused to heal myself from my own traumas and I allowed myself to become the arsehole. I\u2019m back in NA and now I\u2019m committing to sobriety I have to sit through that pain and I know that\u2019s life I\u2019m accepting that I have to take responsibility for my actions I think I just needed to vent. Just come off my first NA meeting in a long time and shared the truth for the first time. Trying to remain positive but iv been terrible to so many people and iv dragged down some very good people in my mess",

Forgiveness from others is wonderful, but do the work to forgive yourself so you can move on, even if they never forgive you. Forgive yourself for being vulnerable, forgive yourself for not having the best start in life (idc what anyone says, people with positive self image and supportive families don\u2019t need to abuse drugs like we did), forgive yourself for your past actions and mistakes. Celebrate and relish that you are clean now, you\u2019re doing the hard work to get yourself and your life right, and celebrate your growth. You wouldn\u2019t be here today, getting clean and with this new mindset, if you hadn\u2019t faced that adversity. One user to another, I really wish you hadn\u2019t gone through all that pain and trauma, but share your story and be proud that you\u2019ve overcome one of the hardest battles in life. Use your story to encourage others, let others know you can live with and move on from your mistakes and being an asshole in the past is no reason to keep torturing yourself with drugs, you deserve better! Forgiveness is more than what you\u2019re thinking it is- forgive yourself for your past and give yourself the life you always deserved. Congratulations OP!",

Sometimes someone will bring up how I used to be and I still cringe, but the cringe is shorter now because I have so much more to be proud of. You got this, keep going and you have a big community out there to support you. We all know exactly what you\u2019re feeling but don\u2019t forget to pat yourself on the back!!",

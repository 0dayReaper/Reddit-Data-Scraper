You have suffered a lot of physical and emotional damage from his actions. How long ago did this happen? Have you reported him or gotten a restraining order? \n\nI'm glad you're getting help and walking it through. You're not alone and you're not defined by what he did to you. You're a survivor and a fighter. You have a bright future ahead of you and you can heal and grow from this. I hope you can find some peace and happiness in your life.",

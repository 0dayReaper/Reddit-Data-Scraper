But my mom and dad don\u2019t support getting married young and my dad doesn\u2019t like my bf cause he\u2019s more feminine. So we can\u2019t tell them and I\u2019m not close to any extended family. But I needed to tell someone so here.\ud83d\ude0a I still can\u2019t believe it I\u2019m so happy and excited. Also nervous cause huge life decision. But ahhhhh",

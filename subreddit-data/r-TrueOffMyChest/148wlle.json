    "postText": "This is a throwaway btw (don\u2019t know if the mods need to know that) \n\nFor some context, my best friend (we\u2019ll call Aria) and I have been close ever since high school. She is the only person I actually trust and we\u2019ve always had each other\u2019s back no matter the situation and that will never change in my book. \n\nWednesday night, I was getting ready to take an edible and watch a movie. I got a call from Aria out of nowhere asking if she can come over and talk to me, and I can hear her voice like cracking a bit and I could tell it was something serious. I obviously told her yes. \n\nShe came over and we sat down and talked. She revealed to me that a couple nights ago she got really drunk at the bars during one of our bar\u2019s pool leagues. She was hanging out with her girls and a couple of the guys, and one of the guys offered to bring her home. \n\nThis guy, we\u2019ll call Brett. Brought her back to his place since her place was far out from his. He said she could sleep in his bed with him, and she said preferred the couch. Aria was obviously very impaired, but she mentioned that he got very aggressive/touchy with her by the end of the night. She said she blacked out, but beforehand she said that he started really feeling her up and eventually put his hands in her pants and well\u2026let\u2019s just say dude was involuntarily inside of her. She says she remembered bits and pieces, but adamantly remembers telling him no very clearly. \n\nShe was very torn up about this, as she was friends with him for a long time and didn\u2019t think he would do this. She felt violated and confused and she started crying on me and asking me to hug her. She said she was scared people wouldn\u2019t believe her because he is well liked amongst our group and even to her, hasn\u2019t given any indication he was like that. She thinks people are gonna say she is looking for attention. \n\nNow anyone who knows Aria, knows that would never be the case, but at my age, people love drama so I can see it too, unfortunately.\n\nShe has been staying with me for the last few days and I have been taking care of her. I took work off today and spent the day with her watching movies, and she even prefers if we sleep in the same bed/cuddle at night.\n\nI personally was against this at first, because I don\u2019t know where her head is at, and what she is truly felt comfortable with, but she insisted that she has been consenting and \u201cneeds the comfort\u201d so I\u2019ve been very careful with everything. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to be Superman, but I have a friend who is clearly upset and grieving/processing everything still, and she is gonna start telling people soon, and she knows I\u2019m 100% behind her. However, there is no guarantee they believe her and it gets worse mentally for her. \n\nI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m having trouble explaining what my head is saying to me, but I really care about her a lot and I wouldn\u2019t mind stories from other people who been in either position because I feel like she is really depending on me right now, and I just want her to be okay and getting through it in a healthy way. I care about her long term well being. I question wether her staying with me is even good, but at the very least, I\u2019m here if she needs something. \n\nTLDR: Best friend was SA\u2019ed by one of the guys in our group, worries people won\u2019t believe her, and has been staying with me lately still processing everything.",

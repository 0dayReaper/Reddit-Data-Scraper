    "postText": "Tl; dr at the end \n\nI 16F honestly don't know what I want to get out of this post. Maybe to vent or get some advice from strangers that might actually read my post. \n\nI\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately about my situation with my mom. I don\u2019t feel much for her. At most, I wish her the best, until she says or does something to me or others around me.\n\nI don't want to say my mom is a terrible person, but she is not a good person. She's the type to send food back and sometimes she doesn't cause a scene, the keyword was sometimes. She is the type of person who yells at a worker, or gets really pissed off when something is blown out of proportion, sometimes she's in the right but others\u2026\n\nNow to me, and how she treats me, I think I'm a little short sided when it comes to this topic, but here we go. My mother has proven me wrong time and time again when I try to tell myself that she is not that bad and try to put effort into our relationship. She did things that were well uncalled for, like beating me for having 5 loads of clothes to wash, two of those loads were my bed sheets. Slapping the crap out of me because I woke up late, and continued hitting me while asking questions. With me just waking up and my tendency to say stupied stuff second after being woken up, my brain hadn\u2019t been cooperating and it only made her angrier. \n \nShe bitten my hand when I was a kid because I was a terrible nail biter and she hated that. Told me she\u2019d shave my head since I wanted to be a boy so bad. She hit me with a hanger repeatedly because I couldn\u2019t spell a word correctly. She choked me when I left my keys at school. I knew exactly where they were, but she wasn\u2019t hearing any of it. There are a handful more of Incidents with her but this post is getting long as it is.\n\nSo on to today's accusation. She\u2019s asked me the \u201cwhat is wrong with you,\u201d  question before. I have to convince her nothing is wrong because there are a lot of things wrong and it's mostly centered around her. I'm not ready, nor am I comfortable sharing how I feel about her. When I don't even see her as a protective haven to talk to. I don\u2019t love my mother, heck i don't even like her. She has a mutual ground that keeps changing courses depending on how she continues to treat me. I won\u2019t say I could never hate her because I know it's possible. \n\nI\u2019m sure she thinks she did a good job of parenting, when in reality her own daughter doesn't even love her anymore. Every single time I say goodnight, leave the house or vice versa, and end a phone call with her. I lie and say those three words I don't mean at all. I tried to feel bad about it but I don't, I can't bring myself to feel for the relationship that died for me years ago. \n\nI\u2019ve been debating with myself to cut her off for the longest when I move out. When I ask for others' opinions I get mixed responses, and honestly I don't know what I should do. I wouldn\u2019t be debating this so hard if she hadn\u2019t put me in a program that could land me a scholarship. Granted I hate being there, and the program is for investing and entrepreneurship, which is something I am not interested in. I thought I could make something positive out of it so I went along. \n\nI kept thinking over the way she would react to me ghosting her, and I feel like I\u2019d slapped her in the face if i did, I mean it was well deserved in my book but still. As many times she disregarded me, disrespected me, I never disrespected her, she's accused me of it many times, and I feel offended every time she does, but still. \n\nAnyway\u2026I don't really know where to end this so I'll leave it here. Have at it in the comments if you made it this far. And Before anyone says anything about therapy, I'm already on it once I get out of here.\n\nTl;dr The situation with my mom is pretty complicated for me (16F), and I have mixed feelings about it. I\u2019ve lost the love I had for her a long time ago, due to mistreatment and her ways of disciplining me and going too far at times. She doesn't understand why I've been so distant with her, and it is honestly sad to know she'll never see the way that she treated me was wrong. I feel as if i should cut her off but she\u2019s done something for me that has been thinking against it. She put me in a scholarship program so I\u2019m ify on if I want to or not, because it feels like a slap to the face. I don't know how to end this but I hope you get the jist.",

            "comment": "Wow, I'm a parent, her mistreatment and discipline didn't go 'too far' at times, she picked up too far and beat it to the other side of what are massive felonies deserving literal prison sentences not even counting the emotional abuse and manipulation that would count as felonies on their own as well.\n\nAs soon as you legally can, run as far away and never look back. I have literally never advised anyone to do that to their natural born parent, but not only has she done these horrible things to you, doing these things may seriously affect your ability to have healthy relationships with other people down the line.\n\nDo you think she actually put you in that scholarship program for you? Unless she's loaded and doesn't have any financial burdens she's putting you in investment and entrepeneurship so she doesn't have to work another minute of her life since she raised an obedient little cash machine (at least she presently thinks). That constant accusation of you disrespecting her while she's actually massively disrespecting (and committing crimes on) you is a way to shift the focus from what she's doing to cause you to focus on what you're doing so you'll second-guess yourself and maybe even believe you deserve it.\n\nThe fact that you're entertaining the idea that it would be wrong of you to leave eventually means she's kinda already gotten to you. I'm really glad you will be seeing a therapist and I can see why you wouldn't be in therapy at present, any therapist that heard this is immediately required by law to contact the authorities and if you made these claims to a child protective service worker, your mother would never be allowed to see you again if not also be charged with serious crimes.\n\nI need you to understand how serious I am in this, you don't have to tell someone or get her in trouble, but the moment you are a legal adult, never be under that woman's control or influence again. I have a feeling that's not even the half of it, people usually only admit a few of the 'pretty bads' even anonymously. If you entertain the idea that she can be a part of your life, she will never let you get better, you will always 'owe' her or it will be 'disrespect.' If you get into this program she will constantly play that \"I got you where you're at\" card to manipulate you. Asking what's wrong with you is trying to plant the idea in your head that there *is* something wrong with you and/or justify herself in how she's treated you in the past and will continue to do so.\n\nAs far as what to do in the meantime, lie. Do and say whatever it takes to convince her of your sincerity that nothing is wrong and please do not ever open up about any of your real feelings to specifically her. Try this (if it won't get you beaten), come up with something that is close to the truth, like not really but close enough to be believable to suggest is bothering you and then watch and see how that 'admission' she thinks is real gets used against you and how often you will hear it referenced in subtle ways to make it worse while acting like she's doing something for your benefit. The truth about the consequences of opening up to her about your real feelings will shortly become very apparent.\n\nEdit: I'm going to add that I was married, we have two children, I left her and filed for divorce because of behavior similar to this towards our children so they would be safe at least half of the time. I couldn't really prove what all had happened and she has a lot of family and friends in this area and I don't so I filed no fault and insisted on half custody. If she had done things at the severity you're stating, she'd be sitting in prison right now along with anybody else who knew about it and did nothing.",

                    "comment": "Like I said blind sided\ud83d\ude05\n\nBut anyways, thank you for taking your time to write your reply. \n\nI agree with you but honestly I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on how big this actually is. I know she could get in trouble but I always thought since the worst of her punishments were in my childhood,(Mostly because I ticked her off for doing dumb stuff (her words), also was a lier back then so it made it so much worse), so I thought she wouldn\u2019t get in trouble as much. \n\nThere was a time I was very close to telling my school counselor about her, but I didn\u2019t want to be move into the system and lose all the friends that feel more like family than anything. \n\nI think I\u2019m not seeing this as big as you think it is, because I was groomed in to thinking this was normal. And given its (I wouldn\u2019t say encourage, but I can\u2019t find another word so we\u2019re going with that one) encourage to discipline your children by hitting them with a belt or hand, or I\u2019m my moms case, all the above. \n\nI\u2019m a quiet child, don\u2019t really like being around people or talking to them really. My mom complains to me that I\u2019m a chatterbox when I\u2019m with my friends, but when I\u2019m with her I\u2019m always mumbling or talking low. I\u2019ve gotten in trouble for that as well. Fixed it along the way, but that\u2019s just how I talk I guess. \n\nI don\u2019t think she is manipulative, maybe she is, maybe not, I\u2019ll stay ignorant until I can\u2019t anymore. Eventually I\u2019m going to have to face the reality but I don\u2019t want to just yet. \n\nAlso the program is for POC, black people. It\u2019s a good program, just not for me. I met new people and have something close to a friendship with them. She didn\u2019t force me into it she asked one day and I said yes, and then she turned around and said even if I didn\u2019t like the program I\u2019m staying in it, so I guess. And if she has the audacity to guilt trip me, the block button with be my new favorite friend. \n\nPeople have told me I shouldn\u2019t cut her off simply because of the fact that she is my mother, and a child needs their mother. I thought about that and I think they are right in some sense. I honestly don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to go to college without financial aid from her. I mean I can get it from my family on both sides but I don\u2019t like asking for money. I\u2019m just hoping I don\u2019t end up homeless, and not in college and getting my degree like I wanted too. \n\nAlso, my mom had me really young so she said she doesn\u2019t want me to be like her. Hence the program and all of that. Don\u2019t know what you said actually hold some weight with her, but it\u2019s possible and I\u2019m just blind when it comes to my own situation. \n\nThank you again, you have a wonderful day or night!\n\nEdit: I forgot to add something in here. \n\nAbout the \u201chaving healthy relationships with other people\u201d part. I think I\u2019m doing pretty well. It\u2019s the parenting part I\u2019m worried about. I\u2019m not, by any means, laying a finger on my future children but I\u2019m scared I\u2019m going to turn out like her in some way. I don\u2019t believe it to be true but it\u2019s a nagging feeling. \n\nThe way she treated me had rubbed off on me, and people say that you can inherit traits from your parents and I\u2019m seeing that to be true. I use to hit myself when I couldn\u2019t do something right, and belittle myself until I was in tears. Wondering why I couldn\u2019t do that specific thing. The hurting (never cut myself or anything like that) my self thing stopped after realizing that it wasn\u2019t right, so did the self criticism, a little. It\u2019s still there, in some form. But it only phases like \u201cyou\u2019re and idiot\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019re so stupid\u201d. \n\nThere was a time I was very close to ending my life  towards the end of last year. I just got so stressed out with all that was going on with my mom and school and other teenage insecurities. Had to remind myself that I would be hurting a lot of people that I love and love me as well (my extended family on both sides). None of them know the stuff that goes on with my mom, at least I think so.",

I was somehow off the page (not my choice, just couldn't access) for over a day else I would've gotten back sooner. Your reply has been very thoughtful and pointedly addressing many of my specific assumptions and challenging them (non-confrontationally) with more context.\n\nI still can't agree with what happened, but you've managed to turn at least most of it into relatively healthy mindsets. Being more openminded, taking personal inventory, significant personal awareness compared to many your age (well, even a large portion of adults), due diligence to not repeat the same and giving thought to how you may be later which will help you stop or work on things if you encounter them.\n\nSince most of the worst things happened a long time ago and have gotten better that is promising. I don't condone that they ever happened to begin with, but that is objectively better than randomly throughout out persisting to this day and possible in the future.\n\nI kinda went to worst case scenario because I am particularly sensitive to this topic as I am only 5 months out of a yearlong divorce because I was continuing to see bruises on my children (almost teenagers) after I explained it was a felony, there wasn't a reason good enough to excuse it, and seeing it and not reporting it where I live is also a felony. Not trying to hijack, just adding context to how my experiences adjusted my perspective.\n\nThis all is to say I was likely a little extreme, some things really suck but can be forgiven, and seeing your thoughtful reply I am much less concerned and insistent that you 'should definitely get away.' Thank you:).",

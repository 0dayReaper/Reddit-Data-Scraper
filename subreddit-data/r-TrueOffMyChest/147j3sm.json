My friends don\u2019t even know what that is or what it\u2019s like. They think they need to be talking/dating someone all the time!! I be telling them to chill tf out and just enjoy life. Stop stressing. \n\nIg that\u2019s why I\u2019m the friend that travels a lot cause I got nothin holding me back anymore\ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m more independent in life and will do everything by myself if I gotta. I\u2019m more in love with myself and life.",

    "postText": "So basically in 2016 my youngest sister ran away at midnight of the day she would be turning 17. The reason I know she ran away with a 30+ year old man is because he had been a not so close family friend. Let me explain. My mom got a job as a elementary teacher, and usually parents help in class. She had a mom who would help a lot, we sort of got acquainted with her family. So us kids (my mom being the teacher) and her kids (the class \u201chelper\u201d) would get together sometimes so we could babysit and whatnot. All was well and not too unusual since it was in a fairly small town in upper Michigan. This went on for a year or two we would babysit there kids, and go over to help with things.  Then we moved, only a few hours away, but my youngest sister would still go and babysit sometimes on summer break. My mom thought it was fine since we knew them, and it felt safe. They just needed a babysitter for times they would take trips, or for being busy during the week. But I felt like it seemed weird, no one else believed me. My sister started really pulling away, like not talking as much and way more moody. I didn\u2019t get along great with her but we were in high school at the time as teenage girls, so that on surface seemed normal. But then I started noticing things, like she had a lot of new clothes and things. We were a pretty poor family so this wasn\u2019t normal, we thought she was stealing it so my mom had a talk with her. But she got angry and threw a huge fit screaming at us and locked herself in her room. I later discovered she had a card in her wallet I think it was a visa gift card. And she just said, oh this is from \u201cdealing\u201d they bring stuff and I sell and they pay me with this. Big red flag for me, I know my sister smoked occasionally but this story really sounded like a straight lie. I knew the people she was friends with and it being a small school I know I would have her if she was \u201cdealing\u201d. Things only got worse from here. I went to the movies with my at the time boyfriend. And who do I see sitting in the front, my youngest sister INBETWEEN the woman who helped in my moms class, and her husband. no kids, just the three of them. And this is in our new town, they live a few hours away. So I really am worried something felt off when I saw that, I tried to talk to her but she would threaten me with violence. She would go on to deny it, then sneak off more and more. It all came down to their birthday, it was the morning of her birthday(17th). We go to her room, she\u2019s gone. We eventually get ahold of her and she admits to going their home, the husband took my sister in the night she turned 17. My mom and dad and even grandparent (who lived several hours away) went to that home begging for her to come back and demanding them to make her come back. She is barley 17!(at the time) The family called the police on my family. You know what the police said to my poor mother, \u201cshe\u2019s legally an adult\u201d. They did NOTHING. The husband would go on to divorce his wife, take custody of their children. Marry my sister and get her pregnant twice. She cut off my whole family except to communicate sparsely with one of my sisters. I don\u2019t know how to feel about this even 7 years later.",

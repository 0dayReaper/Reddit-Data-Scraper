    "postText": "Hi, all! Lurker, first post, etc.\n\nMy (21 M) parents (43F &amp; 55M) had their wills updated a week ago and I was given the TLDR and I have really mixed feelings about it on a couple of the points.\n\nFor one, I'll still be the one taking care of my 8 younger siblings and my parents expect me to \"uphold their lifestyle\", but a trusted neighbor and friend will be the executor of everything but the house. The house will be paid off and put into my name. Even just on this, I'm emotionally constipated. I love my siblings dearly, but there is no way I'll be able to uphold all of their activities on my own. I can barely juggle my own classes, never mind all their sports, academics, and musical endeavours all on my own. And all the money being behind a living paywall certainly wouldn't help matters what with uniforms, equipment, clothes, clubs, etc. Additionally, I've expressed that I don't want the house, though it makes sense that I'd get it because I'm the only adult child in the house. The real thing that concerns me is that I wouldn't be able to sell it because my younger siblings would want the house which I totally understand but the legal stuff behind giving the house to them is something totally beyond me. And if I did give it to one of the kids later on, would I be doing so against the wishes of a deceased parent?\n\nOn top of that, there was the point that, if either of them were unable to make medical decisions for themselves, who would be in charge of that decision? For my dad, it would be his brother. I don't get along great with my uncle, but I do think he's the right choice to make that sort of decision: he cares for my dad but is capable of measuring a situation. After some anxiety, he'll make a good decision. For my mom, however, she chose her own mom for the sole reason that she's a \"cold bitch\". Her mom is a child-abusing narcissist who thinks everyone should treat her like a queen bee and I don't think she'll make the right decision for everyone involved. She'll go, \"What's the cheapest option? Death? Unplug her, then.\"\n\nAnd maybe that's what my mom wants, if she were ever in a coma or something, not to give us false hope, but it being done with no remorse or care? I don't know, that hurts me for her. And I'm not going to pretend my relationship with my parents is great, I've been a flying monkey for most of my life and I've had to avoid them on certain days and they've been emotionally neglectful at best but I don't know, the prospect of them dying hurts. The knowledge that they don't really trust me with major decisions hurts. Have my best efforts to prove myself gone unnoticed? Am I selfish for thinking that when all of this would be during or after my parents' deaths? Should I really be thinking so much about \"just in case\" scenarios? I don't know, I just have a lot of emotions right now.",

            "comment": "None of this makes sense. Why would the executor be a trusted friend and neighbour and not you? You're an adult. \"maintaining that lifestyle\" are they expecting to die before your siblings become adults? Usually it goes into a trust if they are underage. \n\nYou most certainly cannot sell the house if your parents have given your siblings a portion of it in the will.\n\nIt feels like your parents still see you as a child, and not old enough to make financial decisions. I would have an actual conversation with your parents about this along with your concerns, and ask why they wrote it this way.",

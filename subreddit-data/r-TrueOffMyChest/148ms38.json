    "postText": "So when I had recently turned 19 I moved in with this guy (we'll call him Jake) and his roommate (who we'll call Sarah). Jake and I first met up as a hookup but we got along really well so we started spending more time together until he saved me from my poor living situation. I then entered a sexual and platonic (but non-romantic) dynamic with him as he became my dom, at the EXACT same time that Sarah also entered a dynamic with him under the same parameters. I'll admit things were going REALLY well and all three of us were having a lot of fun together and we all just genuinely cared about eachother a lot. A few months in I started to notice that every new toy that was bought got used on Sarah first. When I had a talk with Jake about it he told me that they were things that Sarah had specifically requested (this whole time I had been requesting a lot of the same things). I figured that I would get more of what I wanted eventually too. We then shortly after moved into a new place and we LOVED it. Things were again going really well until Sarah started to get everything first again. This included types of scenes that would happen, new toys, etc. So I started to get jealous and I brought it up to Jake again. He assured me that I'll get a lot of stuff too and that he'd plan stuff out for me. Then he invited a guy over so that he and this other guy could do stuff with Sarah while I sat in the other room, 100% excluded and had to listen. That was a REALLY hard night for me and I'll admit I ended out drinking a lot that night. So Jake and Sarah started telling me that they were worried to have fun together due to my jealousy. So I felt awful and really started to try to suppress it and just hope that I would get what Sarah was getting. This only continued to get worse as Sarah started getting more of EVERYTHING. Scenes, toys, cuddles, gifts, etc. Keep in mind that they had the same non-romantic dynamic that Jake and I had. When I would bring it up that it felt like Jake was playing favourites, he would always assure me that he wasn't, and I believed him. Sarah started having scenes with a new guy and had many of them planned by Jake while I was still begging to get even a hint of what Sarah got. But everytime I would cry or beg, Jake would assure me that everything was fair and that I'd get something soon. But soon turned into months and months and months without any change other than Sarah continuing to get more and more attention. After over a year of living in this new place I started demanding to be treated equally and fairly because there was VERY clear favouritism towards Sarah and it hurt so much that my mental health had been rapidly declining. Eventually Jake sat me down at the table with Sarah there and told me he was ending our dynamic. It hurt so much. I accepted it but I did still ask if there was anything I could do to fix things and he told me there wasn't. He told me that I would either have to fully take care of myself there or move out within a month. I knew if I stayed, my mental health would've declined further. I was crushed knowing that over a year and a half of promises, plans, fun, everything was over. And I realize now that he neglected, gaslit, and lied to me for all that time. Things were never fair, Sarah was always the favourite, and all of those promises and plans were empty. It hurt so much and I'm still recovering mentally. It's a very slow process but I do feel like I can be happy again. I'm still discovering other ways that he hurt and traumatized me, I still have nightmares and panic attacks. One of the hardest things I had to do was blocking Sarah. She was always amazing to me and would even try to get Jake to pay more attention to me, but she chose to stay with the man who mistreated me for so long and I have been so negatively affected by that dynamic that I had to cut her out of my life too. It's what had to be done for me to start to move on.",

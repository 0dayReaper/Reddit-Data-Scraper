    "postText": "Pretty much just the title.\n\nI walked across the stage, got my diploma cover. For the recessional, we all had to re-enter the sort of \"backstage area\" where we'd sat waiting for the time to enter the auditorium.\n\nI waited in line for my diploma, and my family finally caught up with me. They said their hellos, but one of the next things out of my mother's mouth was, \"are you ready to wrap it up?\"\n\nNo. Obviously, I'm not ready to wrap it up while I'm talking to my boyfriend and you cut me off mid-sentence. *No,* I'm not ready to leave five minutes after I enter the recession hall. And *no*, mom, I don't feel as good anymore with you complaining over my shoulder every 30 seconds about how tired you are from spending all that time waiting in line, and hinting at me that I'm inconveniencing everyone by wanting to take a few minutes to let it sink in.\n\nWhen my family showed up in the recession hall, my aunt and my grandmother weren't there. I'd asked about them, but I got brushed off a couple times, and finally my dad just said \"upstairs, waiting on you\". We make our way up the escalators and, as we're looking around for them, I hear my dad's phone ring. I assume it's my grandmother getting impatient, asking where we are.\n\nNope. It was her telling my dad that my aunt and her left after all the graduates finished walking. They didn't even wait to see me after; they wanted to \"beat the crowd\".\n\nOnce we got home, my parents kept badgering me about my \"bad attitude\", asking why I was in such a bad mood, and to \"just let myself be happy for once\" (which, frankly, makes no sense. I could be a very happy person if my family wasn't generally a flock of bad-natured assholes).\n\nThey just went on and on and on. My dad eventually walked outside, but my mom kept going, so I lost it. I told her my graduation dinner set for tomorrow night was cancelled. That I was upset that she rushed me when I told her over and over again, that I just wanted was a little more time. That I felt angry my grandmother didn't even bother to stick around. That they didn't tell me congratulations, or even that they were proud, when I've struggled as much as I have just to make it here. When my dad walked back inside, I told him the same thing I told my mother, and he reacted like a rabid dog.\n\nBig argument takes place, yadda yadda yadda, and I go upstairs to plan the new dinner I thought sounded better for my mental health: just me, my boyfriend (who also graduated), his mom and his little sister. That might sound strange, but I spend a lot of time at his house, so we're all pretty close.\n\nWell. I call him, tell him the plan, he says the restaurant is too expensive. (Not much above average price, but they plan to travel out of the country in a few weeks, so of course I understand budgeting to prepare for that.)\n\nI offer to help pay for it, on top of what I would've paid for myself; I don't care about the money, it's what I *truly* want, and I'm willing. He quickly declined, and while I would have loved to do it, I get he's probably uncomfortable with his girlfriend helping pay for his family's meals. He starts getting on me about saving, grilling me about why I just *need* to have an expensive dinner. I don't want it because it's expensive; I want to go because it's my favorite restaurant and it has significance to me.\n\nWe get snippy with each other, things get a little heated, then they cool down. I ask him for suggestions for other places with more reasonable prices that we might both enjoy, and he gets moody again and says he \"doesn't even want a dinner anyway\".\n\nMy mom gave me shit for the place I picked for the other dinner, got mad and told me that they'd all be miserable, so I felt like garbage about that and was already considering cancelling it. So much happened today, and I just felt so done with my family that it pushed me over the edge. Now I find out my boyfriend doesn't even want any part in the new one I tried to plan and was more excited about. Not even if we go to a different place, with lower prices.\n\nIt was supposed to be one of the best nights of my life so far, instead it feels like one of the worst.\n\nI just wanna do something, with somebody, who wants to do something with me. I feel overlooked. I feel sad. I feel like an obstacle. I feel like my ceremony was just a pain in the ass for everyone because, towards the end, that's all they treated it like it was. I can't even manage to be happy about it.",

Now, you can surround yourself with people who will share your happiness.  The SO seems to have really let you down.  He of all people should have given it with you too celebrate. I'm sorry, internet buddy. I think you did great!",

He got up pretty early yesterday and had a busy day before we even got to graduation, so I\u2019m guessing he was just very tired and a little cranky by the time we got around to talking about it. I was upset for a bit, but it seems to all be working out in the end and that\u2019s all I can really ask for :)",

Including your boyfriend.\n\nMy boyfriend FaceTimed me a few hours ago (as I was waking up) with his family and everyone, himself included, was excited for dinner later. He got up way earlier than I did yesterday, went to sleep late the night before, and had a busy day even before we got to graduation, so I\u2019m attributing the comment he made to him just being tired and a little cranky. Yeah I was upset, but saying that was pretty out of character for him, so I figured the moodiness was probably just a result of all the stress and him being exhausted. So that part worked out okay in the end :)\n\nAs for my parents and some of my other family members, I know. I get my hopes up all the time that they\u2019re finally starting to do better, but it\u2019s rare that anything comes of it. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t hate my family; I just definitely don\u2019t get along great with them all the time. Some other things have happened in the past few days that have me really considering what kind of relationship I want with them after I move out, which feels like shit to say. I love my family, I just don\u2019t always love the way they treat me.",

                    "comment": "&gt;&gt; How long were your family at the graduation for, start to finish?\n\nAt that point, about 3 hours, which is (obviously) less than the amount of time that I was.\n\n&gt;&gt; How long were you chatting in the hall?\n\nI didn\u2019t really get a chance to. We had to wait in lines to pick up our diplomas, which I had told them multiple times in the days leading up to the ceremony, so they would know what was going on. My brother saw me as I was being handed the envelope with my diploma, and I got with the rest of my family as soon as I walked away. I got a chance to take some pictures with my boyfriend\u2019s family, our families stood and made small talk. I went to ask my family to take pictures with me as well, but my mom cut me off to ask if I was ready to go. Her eagerness to just leave without taking pictures, while everyone else and their families were posing for theirs, made me feel bad and I just gave up on asking. My big day and they didn\u2019t give a shit. All in all, we stayed for about 10 minutes total after they found me. I asked her for a few more minutes and her response was \u201cOP, this isn\u2019t a damn party. It\u2019s time to go.\u201d\n\nI lost it after days of my mom guilting me for the place I picked, for wanting my boyfriend\u2019s family there, of them generally making it sound like the biggest chore in the world just to watch me graduate and celebrate after. Maybe I could have handled it better, but honestly, I was just tired of being shit on.",

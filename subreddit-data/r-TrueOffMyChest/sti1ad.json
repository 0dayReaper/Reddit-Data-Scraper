My mom's mother died when my mom was 27 so my grandpa remarried and that woman had 5 adult children! 3 girls and one boy. My Dad left my mom for one of those women who was NASTY! My mom had a nervous breakdown and her own Dad turned against her bc his new wife told him to so she had no one! Back then my Dad worked on the RR and was gone a lot and didn't want her to work so all she did was make his home and meals etc perfect for HIM! She had him adopt her oldest child who was a toddler and had her own child with him! She was a horrible jealous, toxic person. In turn she kicked him out once her kids were raised! THEN he married his 3rd wife based on looks in his late 40's. She was the most selfish biggest bitch. He died of cancer after fighting so hard and suffering horribly mostly alone or with ME not her. She couldn't be bothered. Although he left EVERYTHING to her! Now that I'm older I'm sickened by these weak men! I think that's why I'm single at 47. If a mand doesn't have a backbone, especially for his own children then I don't want him!",

But his daughters call my mom \u201cmama\u201d (they are grown women). I can\u2019t bring myself to call him my stepdad. Just my mom\u2019s husband. Using the word \u201cdad\u201d is reserved only for one person in this world. Even if it\u2019s modified. Sorry, I can\u2019t do it.\n\n\nEdit: For those who were wondering, his daughters speak highly of their mother and seem to have had a good relationship with her. Although I think it\u2019s kind of weird, I would never tell them not to call my mom mama, and it doesn\u2019t really bother me, but my mom really likes it and wishes I would call him dad and have my kids call him grandpa. So I just had to tell her I couldn\u2019t do it. I let my kids choose but they don\u2019t want to call him grandpa either.",

I don\u2019t care if I offend people in huge age gap relationships, so I\u2019ll just say it: she\u2019s well within her rights to feel a flood of different emotions, one of which is likely disgust. That\u2019s valid. She can\u2019t go back to seeing her dad the way she once did. She remembers how young and naive she was as a teenager fresh out of high school and she is experiencing a massive amount of cognitive dissonance about her father could see his own daughter grow through that period of her life as a child... and *still* think a teenager is an appropriate dating partner for a man his age. The whole situation is ick and it\u2019s fine to admit it. \n\nI feel damn bad for her and I think she should talk to a therapist if she is able to. This is one of those situations that even the most empathetic Reddit support doesn\u2019t make it feel much better.",

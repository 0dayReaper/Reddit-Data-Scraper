    "postText": "It\u2019s technically my chore. \nBut whenever we do it together, one crawls into our big blanket covers(I usually let him do that) to get the edges and usually I give him the edges of our blanket so it\u2019s easier to pull it over. \n\nBut whenever I gather the blanket, he slips the covers over his head and pretends to be a singing, dancing, pose striking ghost. It\u2019s completely silly and he laughs so hard while doing it, he once fell on the floor. \n\nI cherish these cute moments so much, but I can\u2019t tell him that because he\u2019s embarrassed when someone hears him\nLaughing. So I always (accidentally!!) forget to do it.",

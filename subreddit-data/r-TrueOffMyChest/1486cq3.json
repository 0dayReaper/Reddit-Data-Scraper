    "postText": "To explain this better because I didn't know how to tell this . My bf is a hard introvert , but he studied how to be social to the point that he's gotten really good at acting extrovert to his friends,  nobody knows he doesn't have enough social battery.  I do get this part because I get social anxiety, and I can't do social life without it draining me. Anyways we been living together for a year and he is not going to my family's dinner because he needs space from everyone, this part I get but I can't explain to him how it hurts a bit since everyone also means me . I will get him a whole day by himself by going to this dinner, but I didn't know he also needed solo time . Am I wrong for feeling a bit hurt, or am I making a big deal of nothing . To explain a bit more we have been busy with social life , him more than me because I said I'm wasn't going to 2 things and he went so his friends wouldn't feel bad he didn't attend. All these events have been in the past 2 months, only giving us 1 weekend free . Like I undertake, he needs to rest, but I can't explain clearly why this is also weird for me. This is also the 1st time he's said he also needs time without me . We both work and don't see each other until 6 pm, and we have 1 day off in common. Maybe I'm just rambling too much.\n\nEdit - I had a ton shit of misspellings because English isn't my 1st language\n\nEdit2 - we talked. It's true,  I'm not completely understanding him, so  I apologized.",

This issue isn\u2019t this one event (or if it is, then yeah you\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing), it seems like the issue is overall how much time you spend together. So tell him that. Tell him you understand he needs to recharge and spend time with his friends, but you\u2019d like to make sure he has enough energy left over for quality time with you two as well.\n\nThis is definitely something you should bring up, just tactfully. It doesn\u2019t really sound like you have a reason to be upset as things stand currently , but you do have cause to address the issue before it becomes bigger. So just remain calm and address this rationally at an appropriate time.",

    "postText": "Tonight a song came on that made me realize how cold I\u2019ve felt for a few weeks now if not longer. I just want to live a happy life, or at least, not so strenuous all the time. How many times have I heard \u201cyou\u2019re so sensitive\u201d as a compliment and a criticism. I wish I wasn\u2019t. I wish I didn\u2019t feel so alone these days. I wish I felt good enough that ranting about it to strangers on the internet didn\u2019t even cross my mind. But, alas\u2026 Here I am. I\u2019m miserable universe. I\u2019m so so tired of never being enough or too much. Please, bring me safety, joy, and something to soften up for. Something to make my heart feel a little lighter a loved during hard times like this.",

    "postText": "I\u2019d like to start this by apologising if I get too explicit at any point, I\u2019ll try cut things down as much as I can and use appropriate language while still giving as much context as necessary. \n\nI\u2019ve been with my (22f) bf (32m) for a few months now, in that time we have been intimate. We like to try to communicate about our s** life and earlier on he made clear to me that he wished I was more vocal when we\u2019re in the act. \nWhen he made comments about me referring to him as \u201cdaddy\u201d during, I assumed he was just giving examples of types of dirty talk I might have heard, so I could get a better understanding of what he meant. \n\nAny ways that was a few months back but recently on two separate occasions so far he\u2019s said something that\u2019s made me extremely uncomfortable. I\u2019ll make a random excuse as to why I wanted to stop, I\u2019ve tried blocking it out and just carrying on but it just ruins the mood for me. \n\nMy bf has made comments on me being \u201ctight\u201d in the past and I\u2019m really not sure if it\u2019s because we\u2019ve been together for a certain amount of time now or if some idiot recommend it to him but now he\u2019s following it up by telling me \u201cohh it\u2019s like a little girls p***y\u201d and he\u2019ll repeat it a few times. \n \nThe first time this happened I kind of chose to just ignore it and forget about it but after last night, I\u2019ll be honest it\u2019s starting to concern me. \n\nAnyone got any advice? Am I being dramatic or is this weird? \n\n+ I don\u2019t actually call him daddy in bed if that matters at all.",

I'd talk about it, the best way to deal with kinks and the likes is to be open. Ask what he's into. If it's just roleplay and maybe dirty talk, then it's harmless, just clearly not for you and maybe it'll change. If it's not just that, then you know there are issues and how to deal with them.",

            "comment": "I am a little older, and in the last 5 years I've dated two women who had rape / incest fantasies. And I wanted me to be \"Daddy\". It was weird, both women's parents got divorced right before they hit puberty, both had almost the same physical build ( including very large breasts), and both wanted me to text them stories about how i, being daddy, would somehow discover them in a compromising situation and then rape them. The first woman kind of blindsided me with this so I went along with the story thing once, and then she wanted to play like that for real and that's when I bailed. (In both cases the woman's character was apparently very young, 16 or 17plus, and the issue wasn't with them being underage just the incest part with Daddy was the turn on for them) The second woman started to go down the same path with the stories and I bailed there too. However, I'm sure there are many many men who would have taken advantage of that situation and found it to be a total turn on.    \n   My point is your boyfriend may have dated someone in the past who was into this and it may have turned him on to the point where he wants to reenact it with you. Don't be surprised if he starts hinting at reenacting scenes where he walks in on you half-dressed and then can't control himself and takes you and you have to pretend that you're both torn but also wanting it. It's really a fucked up fantasy thing but there are people out there, but men and women who find it a huge turn on. I did not",

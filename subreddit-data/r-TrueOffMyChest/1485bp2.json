    "postText": "Context: My friend moved in with me and my partner in February before her daughter was born, we only intended for this to be short term until she could find her feet as I am also expecting our first child in September. \n\nI understand she\u2019s in a tough spot being a single mum and I\u2019ve helped her the best I can, but I don\u2019t want her here when my baby arrives, I want that time to be with my little family and not have to think of somebody else and their child too. \n\nHow can I approach this conversation with her?",

Stressed children. Affected work schedules. Stress that you want the space for your child's memories, but while you're still able to help, you'd like to help them find their own space. \nOffer to pay them to babysit in the future if you ever need a break. If they're cash strapped, offering them that sort of incentive will persuade people, even if they're not a selfish person. \n\nThey might feel shame from this confrontation or feel like a friendship is being threatened by the arrangement, try and keep the interactions positive if possible.",

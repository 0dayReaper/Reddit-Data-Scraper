We have an instagram DM group chat with another friend where we basically send reels all day. Today I sent that news about how Rammstein singer, Till Lindemann had after show parties where he abused women. That friend said \u201cwell it\u2019s very common in the music industry, it\u2019s not okay but I mean, they were not forced to go\u201d. I responded \u201cdude are you kidding me? He drugged, beat and raped these women\u201d. He never answered back. I felt so disgusted. I love him, but how come he thinks going to a metal band after party is consent to get beat up and raped? I feel so angry about his comment, but also sad since it\u2019s a 15 year old friendship that could end like this. Some people told me to go talk to him, tell him how I feel. But he just didn\u2019t give a fuck, didn\u2019t even bother to answer back what I questioned. \nRight now I feel surprised, angry and sad",

If you want a discussion you should just talk to him.\n\nAlso, there was a thread ages ago about folks who've slept with celebrities. Someone said they met Tol Lindemann after a show and that he was a really nice guy. That said, monsters usually have two faces.",

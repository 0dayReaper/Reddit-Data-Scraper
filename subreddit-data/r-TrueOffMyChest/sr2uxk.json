    "postText": "It's hard to describe. I'm from Ukraine, Dnipro, about 200 km from the warzone that's already there for eight years, and we all here kind of used to the Russian baked shit that happening in the east. However, now everything seems different. I'm genuinely sure that they'll try to cut the whole country in half.  \n\nThis situation hits something deep inside, I lost all my friends, all I have is my wonderful sister and grumpy mother. I've never been in an actual fight, I'm just a random copywriter who just lives his life, smokes weed, plays bass, doing dojo and trying to find his second half. Next week I'm going to join the army and soon I'll be dead or become a murderer in order to protect my wonderful sister and my grumpy mother for no reason. Or maybe not.\n\nEDIT: sigh, here we go. They're here, 3 hours driving from our house. I mean actual house.\n\nEDIT 2: (2\\23\\2022)\n- No I'm not in the army, I decided to join volunteer paramedic courses. Thousands of people here helped me to switch toward this direction as well. Thank you all for such warm words. It's hard to keep your head cold these days nomsayin.\n- My family shows no will to move from our town so am I.\n- On Feb 22 Russian troops invaded Ukraine from the eastern front. After that we have a lot of reports about pinpoint artillery skirmishes from their side, however, I don\u00b4t trust anything I see on the web. Hybrid war is based on misinformation so I have to take this into account.\n- On Feb 23 Ukrainian government's planning to legalize firearms and declare a state of emergency. The most hilarious part is that we are still on a visa-free regime with Russia. There's no military response or clashes from the Ukrainian side so far.\n\n\nIs it possible to keep you guys in touch via this thread with editing? Or should I simply make new posts? Or a sub? I've never done such threads before. For those who think that I'm a bot: I will not show any personal credentials to strangers, I'm not 5 years old.\n\nEDIT Feb 24 Kyiv Odessa Dnipro Kharkiv are under attack, we put down two Russians aircrafts, it's 8 am.\n\nESIT Feb 24 1121AM we put down 4 tanks and 6 aircraft, Russians pushing tanks from south and east, actual combat begins.\n\nEDIT Feb 24 1324PM some say Kherson's fallen, 300k citizens large. Dnipro's quiet, Kyiv is under pressure, Odessa is under pressure.\n\nEDIT Feb 25 1109AM I'm with a volunteer HQ right now, donated blood already, filling supplies, driving people around.\n\nSpeaking of the war: they're focusing on Kyiv heavily, bombing civilian buildings, few hospitals were also destroyed, these fucking apes also took Chernobyl's atomic station last night, so we may see the actual apocalypse which I guess may also touch Europe heavily. Guys from EU, I'd recommend you to fresh your memory in terms of radiation civilian protection instructions. Russia broke so many humanistic laws it's indescribable. On the south, we have heavy clashes for ~16 hours at this point. Kharkiv stands still, Dnipro (my town) extremely mobilized and rushed into hot areas.\n\nEDIT Feb 28 I'm volunteering 24/7, constantly rushing between shelters and buying medicine for wounded. Thank God for cryptocurrency. Depression and sleep deprivation. Will go on trenches tomorrow. I'm on territorial defense waiting list, enormous number of volunteers. Russians bombing citizens, 15 dead children so far. Today each Ukrainian is brother and sister. A lot of traitors in high command, special forces working on them [pretty rough](https://twitter.com/IsraelThreads/status/1498359401140396032?s=20&amp;t=L_5GXvIPUWGPY2Xe_tOnQQ) . I have no  energy, 2 days without sleep on crossfit regime. Fuck war. They switched towards airstrikes and artillery today, mainly citizens. Because we're fucking grinding them on land clashes.\n\nEDIT March 06 I was preparing for the war. But how can one be prepared for genocide and nuclear terror? Thousands of civilians are slaughtered like livestock. I'm focusing on wounded in local hospital. Can you imagine the ambient sound of Bosch's triptych? This is life right now. It's fucking hell. Thank you all. If nuking Ukraine means saved people from Europe and the US, guess it's a fair price. The west will not join the war, it's clear by now. We are alone here.\n\nEDIT March 23 Things are sort of getting stabilized. We're slowly surrounding and boiling them in Kyiv upskirts, Mariupol is a tragedy, can't say but civilian casualties may be up to 10k+ there. Google Mizintsev, this sick fuck is responsible for civil bombardment orders. As well as raping, looting, kidnapping, deporting civilians from Mariupol to fucking gulags. My town is under daily bombardments for 6 days, they're launching rockets from Crimea and Kaspian sea. Yesterday they dropped something big, as the report says 2 Urals size combined, that was loud. I left territorial defense forces, because we're basically protecting guys who protect a tree. Waste of time money and resources. No trainings, mainly because it's too many of us wasting time. Now I'm personally focused on vests and helmet manufacturing. It's not possible to get this stuff from Europe (in Ukraine we're out of stock since day 2), so we said fuck it, we'll make our own. So we get 150 tons of armored steel, already made 1000 good vests with dampers and plate carriers nomsaying. A good friend of mine, he's drummer, we've played together for years. He lost his mother, 7yo sister lost her arm and leg, father in coma. That was phosphorus bomb, shelter didn't helped.",

They\u2019re rational actors. \n2.\t**No NATO:** Europe and the US combined have 20 times his economy and 6 times his population. He\u2019s looking to dominate, not BE dominated. Also, conflict with NATO runs into #1. \n3.\t**Small:** Putin has spent [a ton of money and twenty years rebuilding and modernizing the Russian military](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-confronts-ukraine-with-upgraded-military-rebuilt-after-soviet-collapse-11643733217). It worked. But he doesn\u2019t have the economy to match it. He can\u2019t sustain a long war of attrition, and he can\u2019t easily replace things like modern 5th generation fighters. He can\u2019t afford for this to spread. \n4.\t**Fast:** the spring thaw is 6-8 weeks away, max. Once it starts, everything stops. No, it\u2019s not 1943 anymore, but you\u2019re still not moving heavy equipment in mud season. And if you give Ukraine 4 weeks to retrench and NATO 4 weeks to give them money and equipment, it stops being small. \n5.\t**Quasi-Justifiable:** he can\u2019t be 100% the aggressor. Right now, he can say NATO got too close, he had no choice, but if he\u2019s parking tank divisions on the Polish border that goes away. And then #s 1,2 and 3 kick in. \n\nPut all that together, and he needs a small winnable conventional war. A fast grab entirely behind a major river frontier, against a small country alone, 300 miles from Moscow fits that. Grabbing all of Ukraine does not. In fact, even if things went well and he got all of Ukraine anyway, he\u2019d surely give part of it back, or set it all up under a puppet.",

Imagine how US leaders would respond if an independent Quebec was considering entering a permanent military alliance with China and hosting bases, and you start to get how they feel. Only, the US has never had 20 million dead in living memory because of prior Canadian invasions. \n\n2.\t**It gives his military combat experience.** The US and its allies have tons. A few dabblings in Syria aside, Russia has none, and no easy ability to get any. \n\n3.\t**It gives him a \u201cvictory\u201d to pump for domestic consumption.** Just as Trump voters only focused on the win and not the popular vote, so the Russian public might focus only on the win and not on the economic cost. \n\n4.\t**It does SOMEthing.** Russians have felt like they\u2019ve been mired in stagnation and a slowly tightening European noose for decades now, while their leaders are helpless to act. This would be action. \n\n5.\t**It\u2019s a calculated gamble.** They\u2019ll know the costs and risks. But if Ron DeSantis wins or Trump wins again, those all go away, probably. So if *you* were in Putin\u2019s place, looking at Democratic odds come November, and looking at Biden\u2019s age and current polling, would *you* be willing to bet the US couldn\u2019t sustain it?\n6.\t**It eliminates a democracy right next door.** Putin is an authoritarian.

A few years back I realized how many of my supposed problems were self-sustaining because of Main Character Syndrome and a shitton of anxiety over being liked.\n\nOne day it just sort of dawned on me that I rarely ever think much about other people when they're not around, and realized other people are the same way. Out of sight, out of mind.  There's like 0.0001% odds that someone I interact with socially is thinking about me currently.\n\nCombine that with the fact that there's 7.8 billion people on this planet.  I realized that even if some small fraction of them do end up hating me, it doesn't matter.  There's other people I'll get along with, and I'm better of putting my attention toward them.",

Now, 30 years later, the Baltic states, Poland, Romania, they're all in NATO and essentially bordering Russia. So, Russia feels like it's being slowly encircled and it wants NATO to commit to not letting Ukraine into that alliance.\n\nAn aside here is that it's not like US went to these countries and strong armed them into joining. They all asked to join because none of them enjoyed being occupied by the USSR for 50ish years.\n\nAlso, NATO doesn't want Ukraine, but it also can't abide Russia dictating who is and isn't allowed in. Russia doesn't want Ukraine either, it wants a weak, failed state on its border (the theory I find most compelling is that if Russi does invade, it's goal won't be annexation. It wants to federalize Ukraine and be able to play each of those fiefdoms against each other).",

Then, fortify the fuck out of the line of the Dnieper, and double-dare NATO to counter-attack while they surround and capture the remaining eastern half of Ukraine. Then, you let China \u201cbroker\u201d a \u201cpeace\u201d of a divided Ukraine, where a western rump state centered on Lviv is free to join Europe and the eastern half is absorbed by Russia.\n\nTactically, it has a lot going for it. It\u2019s limited in scope, well within their capabilities, doesn\u2019t leave exposed flanks or potentially over-extend, and operates within natural frontiers. It\u2019s basically recreating a cauldron battle.\n\nStrategically, it has a lot going for it too. NATO will help defend western Ukraine, but they can\u2019t risk going east because it puts them on Russia\u2019s doorstep. If you\u2019re Russia, and you figure it\u2019s when not if Ukraine joins NATO and the EU, and once they do it\u2019s too risky to attack, now is the perfect time. You secure your frontier, you gain a major breadbasket and series of ports, and you get to look strong to your public.\n\nBut on a grand strategic level, it seems a bit insane. Even leaving aside the possible risk of nuclear war, it doesn\u2019t make much sense. Russia\u2019s economy is only about the size of Texas\u2019s, and the whole of Ukraine\u2019s economy is only about the size of a small state like Nebraska, or a mid-size city like Washington, DC. They\u2019ll become an instant pariah, and be sanctioned to the eyeballs, in return for\u2026half of DC? With a population that mostly hates them, and will never accept it? And to stay economically viable, they\u2019ll have to essentially become a Chinese vassal? It seems a bit of a steep price to me.\n\nI can only assume this is mostly about internal Russian politics. Ukraine is no threat to invade, and a NATO member Ukraine is no more dangerous than a NATO member Estonia. This appears to be betting that the long term economic hit won\u2019t surpass the short term gains, ie what happened in Georgia and Crimea.\n\nCombination of sources:\n\n1.\t\u2060https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/krise-in-osteuropa-cia-rechnet-mit-russischem-angriff-kommende-woche-a-2e10a45f-b6eb-4b1a-b692-2edc64c04adf\n2.\t\u2060https://www.csis.org/analysis/russias-possible-invasion-ukraine\n3.\t\u2060Friends who are serving officers\n4.\t\u2060Friends who are intel analysts\n5.\t\u2060Two degrees in military history\n\nTo be clear, this is pure speculation. Informed speculation, but still speculation.\n\nIt\u2019s shaped by several factors:\n\n1.\t\u2060No nuclear war: it sounds obvious, but Russia wants to keep this small and conventional. They\u2019re rational actors.\n2.\t\u2060No NATO: Europe and the US combined have 20 times his economy and 6 times his population. He\u2019s looking to dominate, not BE dominated. Also, conflict with NATO runs into #1.\n3.\t\u2060Small: Putin has spent a ton of money and twenty years rebuilding and modernizing the Russian military. It worked. But he doesn\u2019t have the economy to match it. He can\u2019t sustain a long war of attrition, and he can\u2019t easily replace things like modern 5th generation fighters. He can\u2019t afford for this to spread.\n4.\t\u2060Fast: the spring thaw is 6-8 weeks away, max. Once it starts, everything stops. No, it\u2019s not 1943 anymore, but you\u2019re still not moving heavy equipment in mud season. And if you give Ukraine 4 weeks to retrench and NATO 4 weeks to give them money and equipment, it stops being small.\n5.\t\u2060Quasi-Justifiable: he can\u2019t be 100% the aggressor. Right now, he can say NATO got too close, he had no choice, but if he\u2019s parking tank divisions on the Polish border that goes away. And then #s 1,2 and 3 kick in.\n\nPut all that together, and he needs a small winnable conventional war. A fast grab entirely behind a major river frontier, against a small country alone, 300 miles from Moscow fits that. Grabbing all of Ukraine does not. In fact, even if things went well and he got all of Ukraine anyway, he\u2019d surely give part of it back, or set it all up under a puppet.\n\nMy personal best guess as to their end game is:\n\n1.\t\u2060It gets NATO off his doorstep. Russian leaders are traditionally VERY paranoid, not without historical reason, and a Ukraine in NATO is a Ukraine that could in theory host US air bases 300 miles from Moscow. Imagine how US leaders would respond if an independent Quebec was considering entering a permanent military alliance with China and hosting bases, and you start to get how they feel. Only, the US has never had 20 million dead in living memory because of prior Canadian invasions.\n2.\t\u2060It gives his military combat experience. The US and its allies have tons. A few dabblings in Syria aside, Russia has none, and no easy ability to get any.\n3.\t\u2060It gives him a \u201cvictory\u201d to pump for domestic consumption. Just as Trump voters only focused on the win and not the popular vote, so the Russian public might focus only on the win and not on the economic cost.\n4.\t\u2060It does SOMEthing. Russians have felt like they\u2019ve been mired in stagnation and a slowly tightening European noose for decades now, while their leaders are helpless to act. This would be action.\n5.\t\u2060It\u2019s a calculated gamble. They\u2019ll know the costs and risks. But if Ron DeSantis wins or Trump wins again, those all go away, probably. So if you were in Putin\u2019s place, looking at Democratic odds come November, and looking at Biden\u2019s age and current polling, would you be willing to bet the US couldn\u2019t sustain it?\n6.\t\u2060It eliminates a democracy right next door. Putin is an authoritarian. Democracy is anathema to him.\n\nThis is not my answer it is three comments by u/whistleridge further up in this thread.\n[the original explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/sr2uxk/i_just_found_myself_actually_preparing_for_the/hwq4zsl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) | \n[sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/sr2uxk/i_just_found_myself_actually_preparing_for_the/hwq94f1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3) |\n[end game goals](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/sr2uxk/i_just_found_myself_actually_preparing_for_the/hwqd4ak/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)\nPlease don\u2019t give me awards, go to the original comments and give it to the person who wrote all of this out, not the person who just copied and pasted.",

I know people who are very much against attacking Ukraine in theory, but they don't believe anything will happen and sorta ignore the news about it. Putin's active base, anywhere from 10-25% of voters, believe what the state TV says and will retroactively support most decisions. Those who are the most outraged about what Putin has been doing/trying to do to Ukraine, and are outspoken about it - those people are mostly already in political opposition, so their opinions on that have about as much effect as their calls to free Navalny.",

Keep your family safe and do everything you can to stay out of this and any other future wars. \n\nAlso think about this you\u2019re joining right before a possible conflict. You\u2019ll receive minimal training, probably be made infantry and be rushed the the front lines. Russians fight with artillery. If this does become a full blown war you\u2019ll probably die from airburst munitions before you can fire your weapon. That is not a glorious death, it\u2019s not even a meaningful one. \n\nYears ago I left my family to go off and join the Army, I wont get into the specifics but they needed me and I wasn\u2019t there to help them.

I frequent Russian subs and see that very commonly right now. This has led to animosity very quickly. \n\nBut most level headed Russians simply don't want any of this to be going on, especially those at enlistment age right now. In recent years many have felt that things have been going somewhat better in general for them, and the youth especially have been ingratiating into western culture and adopting it into Russia. Which means higher levels of \"Western\" sentiment, and lower levels of blind nationalism. \n\nThat's my take though, as a US citizen who speaks some Russian and gets to see what is said.\n\nI honestly am more concerned with how Ukrainians are feeling. They are small and are the epicenter of it all. They will receive the brunt of everything.",

And I'm no longer dreaming about something big and ambitious for my future.\n\nBut Putin wants something else. At this point its really hard to tell if he is delusional enough to see himself as some sort of Messiah, or he just serves oligarchy interests. \n\nI won't be conscripted unless this shit turns into total war, so I guess I'm lucky. But after new portion of sanctions would hit, it would still be a nightmare. It's funny, cause some people on reddit truly believe that sanctions purposes are to target higher ups, while in reality all the burden is going down onto common folk shoulders. Oligarchs and Putin would keep their countless mansions in Italy and Spain, their accounts in British and Swiss banks would still be fine. All while more and more people would live in a complete poverty.\n\nSo, to answer your question - most of russians don't want this war. The only ones who want it are completely brainwashed, ambtionless lunatics believing bullshit about how we all are gonna get massacred only if we don't obliterate Ukraine.",

Very expensive.\n\nIt often costs 10k USD a person and between 5-10 years to legally immigrate to a new country. For illegal immigration, it's roughly the same to pay someone to get you through the borders, and you are just as likely to be sent back to your country as you are to be put into a refugee camp with horrid conditions.\n\nAlmost all refugees the US gets are upper middle class (in their own countries), as they are the only ones able to afford to leave... And they give up almost everything to do so.\n\n It's not uncommon to hear about the old Cambodian and Vietnamese refugees talk about their maids and nannies they had growing up, and they were only able to escape as they had gems and cash to give the smugglers.\n\nI learned a lot of this when I was attempting to immigrate to Europe from the US. And I'm considered one of the *best* candidates... Young, highly educated, from a first world country, etc. For someone like the OP, it's significantly harder.",

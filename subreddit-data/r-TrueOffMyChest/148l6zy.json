    "postText": "Before starting I would like to say that this probably isnt one of the shocking stories you see going on on this subreddit. I am aware that losing your friends as you grow up is something really common and something i must be at least more mature about but its not easy for me to control my emotions. \n\nSo, my best friend and I (both 20f) have known eachother since 7th grade and became instantly inseperatable. I'm talking about spending 1 whole month at her summer house during almost every summer holiday and sleeping over at eachothers house surely once a week. In these 8 years of knowing and loving her I have seen both her and myself grow as people and have gone through an abundance of emotional situations. She has always been supportive of me when I was at my lowest points due to issues considering serious family/health problems and has treated me better than my relatives did at those rather dark times. Even her parents were there for me and made me feel extreamly loved and welcomed at moments where a lost and disoriented teenager needs a shoulder to cry on. Needless to say I love her tremendously and she is one of the very few people I can actually trust and rely on. I think I should give context at this point and say that I am a person struggling with my anxiety and low self esteem and that fact leads me to be able to open up to about 5 people total in my life even though I consider myself rather social and have plenty of people around me that i appreciate.\r  \n\r  \nSo let's fast forward to senior year in high school, where in the place of the world we live in the exams you have to sit in order to get accepted in some university are highly stressful and many kids get diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorder during that time. So, if one also has in mind that during that period of time a whole pandemic was happening around us and everyone was basically isolated in their own homes,both hers and my anxiety went through the roof. But again we were there for each other and did the best we could. So, we sit the exams and because we were both pretty good students we manage to collect a rather decent amount of points that could get us in the same city (the city that we had always lived that happens to be the capital of our country). She then decides she would like to go to another city to study, about a 6 hour drive from our home due to her wanting to get to see and experience new things, grow as a person, find herself and also live alone. I of course respected her decision and was happy she wanted to do such a step for herself even though it was pretty obvious it saddened me to have my best friend living so far away. But we knew our friendship was built on solid grounds and we have nothing but love for one another so there wasnt anything to worry about (spoiler alert: there was)\r  \n\r  \nAt this point I should mention that we are 3 best friends :me , the girl we have been talking about (lets call her Rachel) and Elle (also 20f, from the same school also). So, after the exams I talked about earlier (summer 2021) we had of course free time for summer holidays. We were supposed to all go to Elle's summer house in August and so we did. But Rachel was at her own summer house before that, and thats where she met her current boyfriend Matt 23M. They weren't in a relationship until the begining of 2023. She was head over heels for him, absolutely in love always wanted to talk about him and didnt want to leave his side not even for a single day. I was very happy for her and wanted to hear about him as much as possible because in our friendship what makes one happy makes all 3 of us. So, when August rolled around she was hesitant of coming to Elle's house as we had agreed upon and even told me she didn't want to be there. She wanted to be with him more and also said she had regrets over coming. At that point I was a bit saddened but I also have been in love and can understand that she was very very excited so I just left it at that.\r  \n\r  \nAnyway, all 3 of us have a great time at Elles house and I had almost forgotten about her rather careless comment of not wanting to come. Summer goes by and she has to leave to the city that she studies whereas both me and Elle stayed at home and started uni here. Our first year of uni was pretty great,we all got to meet new people, start new hobbies go out more, party more etc. Me and Elle went to Rachels city 5 times in the span of 2 semesters and always had a blast when we did. We would regularly text and talk about ecerything going on in our lives so it was as if she hadnt moved at all. Our friendship wasnt impacted at all, which is what we feared, especially in the first year of uni, where everything is new and trying to get used to the new stuff you can be carried away. At one point I thought to myself that it maybe wasnt so cool of Rachel not to come visit us at all (except for the holidays where she practically had to come back and see her family), since she knew I was rather tight with money and even though I wanted to go as much as possible it wasnt always easy.\r  \n\r  \nI'm skiping some parts here because this would go on for too long but lets just say that the things that she was doing for our friendship were little to none at this point and I was seeing her giving more energy to other of her friendships(not new, also from our hometown). I tried to say that I was starting to feel neglected but she basically told me that she will always consider me and Elle her closest people despite what happens or who she does more stuff with. Time goes by and even though she said she was pretty sad about me feeling this way and she would try to change the stuf she does nothing changes. At this point I want to say that Elle agreed with me that Rachel was neglecting us but she is much more of a chill person so she didnt want to cause trouble out of things that then seemed small.\r  \n\r  \nAt this point it's Christmas 2022 and Rachel and Matt (who is living in the same city as me and Elle) are official. Up until this moment the distance made it hard for them to do so and also the fact that Matt was not feeling ready for a relationship, let alone a long distance one so they would just talk or hang out when Rachel was back for Christmas time or Easter. So, the extream love I talked about earlier came back, she would always want to be with him and he would too. She would come home only for him (she never did that for any of us, not even her family), they would go on trips almost every weekend and wouldnt make time time for us in the 5 days she would be home. Matt is also kind of a prick, he used to treat Rachel badly and talk to her in a bad manner, but he has since changed and now treats her really nice. He has continued though to talk very rudely to all of Rachels friends, including fat shaming me in front of Rachel and her telling him nothing about it. I am really insecure about my body (even though now that I am working on my self i see that that shouldnt be the case because I am subjectively normal looking, for reference about 70kg to 1.75m) so that kind of a comment took a toll on me, a fact she understood and talked to me about, that I shouldnt care what anyone has to say etc.\r  \n\r  \nThe day after he made that rude comment on me being fat, Rachel came with heart eyes telling me how much in love she is and how perfectly he now treats her. I didnt want to ruin this for her so I didn't complain that she hadn't told him anything about that. I can't blame her for everyhting though, I know how it is to be completely lost in your feelings for somebody and that fact sometimes changes your prespective and your ability to tell right from wrong. Matt was and still is the most perfect human in her eyes and she can't bring herself to change that idea. Fine until now\r  \n\r  \nOur texting would get drier and drier, we wouldnt talk on the phone at all and on top of everything, I started working so I havent been able to go to the city she studies during this academic year. She would tell us how she talks on the phone with Matt for about 6-8 hours a day on the phone and how they are planning to go there and there together, but whatever plans me and Elle wanted to make she always said she was out of money or time. So we decided to talk to her about it. Me and Elle told her we felt neglected and that the only thing that we have changed was the fact that we couldn't go to her place as often or as spontaneously as last year. The things she had changed on the other hand were a lot. She didnt make any time for us, any effort, nothing.Even when I would call her to check up on her she would find a very obvious lie to hang up and never called back. Everything was and still is all about Matt.\r  \n\r  \nWhen talking to her about it she first said that she is feeling many things and doesnt know how to deal with that abundance of emotions and that's why her priorities may appear shifted but she tried to ensure us that that's not the case. We were still her favourite people and she felt sorry we felt that way but all she wanted to do is experience her lust about Matt. She even told us she felt guilty because what she was doing was making her so happy but at the same time it was something that made us angry or sad, maybe both. Rachel slighlty accused Elle and I of ruining the dream for her because she was split between her love for Matt and the love for her friends and this whole situation put her in a really uncomfortable place. She said she couldnt talk to her best friends about a very happy time in her life because we were bitter about it. I was and still am not bitter about her being in a relationship. i love that for her and want to listen about her feelings as much as possible. its not matt or their relationship that i have a problem with, its that she doesnt care enough for everybody else in this enamored state she is sunk in.Yes, it pains me to see that the person who has always been my no1 priority and vice versa now can go weeks without asking me how i have been\r  \n\r  \nAll I could say was that I had no problem with him, as long as she is happy, I am too. I just couldn't accept that I was losing her and that we would go days and days without talking to eachother. She told me that it's normal for friends to not talk at all times, and yes that is the case, I too have some friends to which i talk once a month or once in two weeks, but it was never like that with her. We had been for 7,5 years suuuper close and talked about everything all the time ,she even knew when I went peeing and now she is unaware of my struggles and I am of hers. I really tried to bridge the gap she had created and call or text more but i quickly found out that that isnt possible to do on my own.\r  \n\r  \nSo, after having talked to her and her saying that she will try to make things better all Elle and I were able to do was just wait to see things changing. but that isnt happening and now i am feeling like this is the new norm and i am completely hurt by it. Rachel says that we remain family to her and she cries for hours when we seem distant to her but i dont know what else to do. I am not seeing any type of effort, on the other hand more and more time spent on her relationship as if i am some random person.\r  \n\r  \nWhat should i do? let go or try?",

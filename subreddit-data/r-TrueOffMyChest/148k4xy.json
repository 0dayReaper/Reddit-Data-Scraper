    "postText": "When I was a 24-year-old, new college graduate, I began working in the system. I was a dumb and naive product of suburbia who went in thinking I could make a difference. \n\nOf course, I found out the system is corrupt, abusive, and riddled with predators. I did my best for a little less than two years, reported what I saw (of course nothing was done), and then got out. \n\nWhen I first started working there, I met a 15-year-old kid. I promised him I'd help him, before I learned that making promises was unwise. \n\nHe left around the end of my first year and asked to keep in contact. I told him he could call me at the facility, not really expecting anything of it. He did call back regularly though. When I left, I gave him my Facebook, because I didn't want him to have my personal number. \n\nOne night, he contacted me suicidal and on the run with warrants. I helped him turn himself in. \n\nThe entire experience wrecked me, because by that point I loved that kid, and knew he'd never had any chance from the start. Violent, dysfunctional, abusive family, extreme poverty etc. Every time he tried to turn things around someone in his life (usually close family) sabotaged him. \n\nAt that point, I'd not only left that job but moved states, started a new career, and was just trying to return to my sheltered, suburban, life and put everything behind me. \n\nAbout two years later though, he contacted me. He was 18, newly released from Juvie, and messing up again. \n\nI told him he could stay with me for a few days, and get his head straight, but he was on the run from parole again so he couldn't stay long term. \n\nIt didn't work out. He took off after confessing he was in love with me when I turned him down, told him it was inappropriate, and that we couldn't be together. \n\nAfter he left, he got sucked straight back into drugs, gangs, etc., and I cut contact for my own mental health and safety. \n\nHere is where I think I crossed the line. Six months later my conscience was eating at me. I found out he'd been sent to jail, so I reached out. \n\nBy some fluke, he was being released with a failed placement from adult jail and negatively discharged. That meant no parole. So, for the first time since he was 12 years old, he was free and clear from the system. \n\nI offered him a spot again. He accepted. I made a deal with him. The only way he had a shot at what he wanted (me) was to get off drugs, cut contact with all is old acquaintances, leave the gangs and violent lifestyle, find a productive/positive career, and live life on the straight and narrow. \n\nI thought the chances of success were slim to none, but it was a last-ditch effort on my part. He proved me wrong. Five years later, he's been clean and stayed clean with no slip ups, he's gotten therapy, and has a really good career in plumbing. \n\nSo, I kept my word, married him, and now we have a daughter. From the outside we look like just another average couple if you don't know the backstory. \n\nThere's just always a nagging voice in the back of my head that says I'm a groomer and a shitty person given how we met. Most of the time, I feel like my actions saved someone's life, albeit in an unconventional morally gray kind of way, but every once in a while I'm hit by crippling fear that I'm a terrible person.",

Were you initially just telling him what he wanted to hear in order to motivate him to make the right choices?

You did not initiate anything, going off what you wrote. You turned him down again when he was 18 and on the run. And only the third time, you gave him a last chance and by doing so you saved his life. It really doesn't sound like grooming to me. Though I can understand if you feel guilty about being attracted to at that time a 15-year old boy. It's messy. Have you ever told him this? Maybe clearing this up with him would help you find closure. Ask him how he feels about it looking back knowing everything.",

It would be a young woman confessing her love to the one person who has shown her kindness, compassion, and care, which was respectfully rebuffed due to the power imbalance and understanding that it probably wasn't really a romantic love but a love born out of attachment to their bright spot in life. A while later, that young woman is fortunate enough to have a clean slate and for the first time in her life truly have the opportunity to straighten out her life. Maybe at this point there's attraction, maybe there's not and it's a manipulation to encourage her to make the effort. It motivates her to put her life on track, get clean, make a career for herself, and improve as a person. During this time, platonic affection turns romantic as these changes remove the power dynamic because now she's capable of being independent and has spent enough time with him to understand if her feelings are truly romantic or an idealized fantasy. She's also had the opportunity to mature and is clearly not the woman she was at 15. \n\nThere's nothing wrong at this point in realizing there could be romantic affection. He doesn't see her as a 15 year old kid anymore, he's seeing the grown woman who put in hard work and dedication to becoming a well adjusted person. Realistically, he knows that she's the same sweet kid he felt platonic affection for at 15, but at the same time she's also an entirely different person because of her new aspect on life.\n\nAt no point did he try to groom her. The manipulation in both scenarios is a very morally grey area, but ultimately seems to be done in order to empower the other person not to make them feel indebted to them. Every effort seems to be made to create an equal dynamic between partners. \n\nYeah, there are people who would tear into a man in this same situation, but if OP is a reliable narrator, then man or woman, there was no misconduct imo.",

Your intentions were companionate and pure &amp; not sexual in any way (based off of what you are saying). And I think that definitely matters. I hope you both are happy.

Absolutely zero grooming happened, you probably feel as bad as you do because you did know him when he was a minor and he confessed feelings while freshly an adult. But remember, he might\u2019ve gone through the ringer, but he is able to make his own decisions too. \n\nYou have nothing to feel guilty for or bad about.

You didnt invent this institutional power dynamic, and you shouldn't be bound to its rules\n\nRemember that other people looking over your shoulder could see it as you being exploited by some type of player. Because even though you feel guilty, all the rules work against your husband.\n\nTake it easy on yourself. And give yourself room to be a hero a little bit. Not everyone gets to make that big a difference in someone's life. Especially someone they love. You had the guts at the right time and place. You weren't doing something bad\n\nI am an ex-offender, and an ex plumber (kind of old now), I know what I am talking about. \n\nMozol tov to both of you, and good luck",

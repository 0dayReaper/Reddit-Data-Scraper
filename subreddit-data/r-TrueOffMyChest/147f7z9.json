    "postText": "I tripped and fell on some sand and seashells today and scraped up the back of my hand. My goofy ass brain is getting the best of me and telling me I need a tetanus vaccine, so I'm gonna try to get one. I also put 2 rounds of antibiotic ointment on it and have none left (RIP). \n\nOn another note, I get incredulous anxiety the moment I have a weird feeling. Dizzy? Brain tumor!!!! Pain which I already have two diagnosises for? Appendicitis!!! Literally nothing? That is so not normal, ANEURYSM!!!!! It has become an actual problem to the point where I get anxious so easily that my dad actually yells at me for it (I'm 15 in a medical program, so my brain is filled with creative ways I could die lmao)",

Think deep puncture wound with something that goes in the ground. Then I'd be more concerned. Don't ruin your life worried abou the medical what-ifs!",

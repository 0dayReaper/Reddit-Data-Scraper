    "postText": "\nI am 28(f)For as long as I can remember i h\u00e2ve nitpicking  every aspect of my life, every cringe moment, days when I wasn\u2019t the nicest kindest person. I use th\u00e8se moments to judge myself very harshly.\n\nThis has in turn destroyed my social abilities, I am paranoid of my ability to interact normally, to form intimate and close relationships both platonic and romantic. At the moment I have 0 friends, my boyfriend I think is about to dump me because of how Sad I am constantly. \n\nI never used to be like this, but I can\u2019t pin point when everything changed, when I became this person. I am afraid I\u2019m slowly losing myself, fading away and missing out on life. I constantly self aware person who can\u2019t get out of their own head and just enjoy the world.\n\nMy heart is very heavy, my mind has constant contradicting voices each of them putting me down.\n\nI am a good person I try to treat everyone with kindness and the respect they deserve, I ensure everybody in every room I walk in doesn\u2019t feel left out, uncomfortable or offended by anyone including myself. \n\nSuicide more times than I have paused  to smile and enjoy my life this month. I\u2019m not saying this for pity, I just need to know what is wrong with me and if there are people who feel like this out there. I have tried therapy but sitting there I could feel the therapist but it didn\u2019t work for me. \n\nI\u2019m honestly tired of my thoughts \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29",

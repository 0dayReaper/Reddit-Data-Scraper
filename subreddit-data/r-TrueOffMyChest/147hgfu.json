I asked her if she cut my balls hair and she responded \u201cno you\u2019re a grown man you can do that yourself\u201d but personally I think she lying but for the next 4 months after that I never been able to grow hair and I\u2019m positive she keeps cutting my pubic hair off before it haves a chance to grow back.. I just don\u2019t understand why she would lie about it",

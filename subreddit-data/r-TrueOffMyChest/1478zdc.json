If you are 1500 and drank 300, you\u2019re only giving yourself a 270 calorie deficit which is negligible at best. \n\nWhile the steps are good, I\u2019ve personally never found that daily walking contributes as much to the deficit as I\u2019d like even if the math checks out. \n\nCut down on the alcohol and Pepsi. You may be one of the lucky ones who can just switch to water and diet soda and the weight falls off.",

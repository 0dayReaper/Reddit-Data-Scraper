    "postText": "The other night when we talked and you told me you\u2019ve finally found reasons to wake up in the morning, keep going-\nI couldn\u2019t stop my tears.\nI hope you really know that there\u2019s nothing more real than the love I\u2019ve felt for you over the years. \nI just want to get this off my chest because I think this is the first time in years I finally feel like I\u2019m doing the right thing when it comes to us.\nOver the past 10 months since you\u2019ve left, I\u2019ve gone through hell just to keep pushing myself to live to see another day.\nI wish you didn\u2019t hurt me the way you did \nBut you had no choice and I know that now. \nI\u2019m not here to talk about everything I\u2019ve been through today, I just wanna accept that -\n\nI will never truly get over you and i am ready to accept that and move on with this. \nDoesn\u2019t matter what passage of time passes by you will always be a part of me, it almost feels like I can feel you with me.\nTo quote from friends, it\u2019ll never be off the table for us. You truly were my lobster.\nBut well, life isn\u2019t a movie and I won\u2019t get my happy ending but I will always fucking love you and support you and even if it stings cause it does cause I\u2019m not in your life right now.\nIt\u2019s a price I\u2019d pay to see you happy.\n\nSo the next time my heart breaks with the thought of missing you,\nI will just remember that you\u2019re happy and that\u2019s truly all I ever wanted.\n\nEver since that night we talked, it\u2019s only been a day really. I\u2019ve felt 10 times lighter\nMaybe even happier cause I finally feel like I can breathe knowing you\u2019re okay.\n\nS, you will never not be a part of me.\nI hope you continue to find happiness and meaning in everything you do.\n\nI think I deserve to be happy too,\nI\u2019ve been trying to convince myself it\u2019s okay. Maybe I finally will. \n\ud83c\udf2e.",

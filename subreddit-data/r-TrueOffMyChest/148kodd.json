Or perhaps they didn't actively \"make a deal\", but enough of them noticed and are treating you gently that it seems everyone was in on it.\n\nIt's also possible that you are feeling hypersensitive about being poorly for a length of time and you are interpreting the concern around you as \"watching you\".\n\nI think a good question to ask yourself is,  what if it's true? Any of it? Would that trigger action on your part? If people are noticing you more than usual because you were poorly, the sooner you get back to normal, the sooner their attention will move on. \n\nTry to focus on your own recovery. This idea of \"everyone is watching me\" is an unproductive distraction. If you think everyone is looking at you,  you will start behaving differently (aka \"acting\") and people will notice, then they really will be checking in on you more as they puzzle through your behaviour.",

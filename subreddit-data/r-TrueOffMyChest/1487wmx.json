    "postText": "Sensitive Topics: Suicide, Eating disorder, Self Harm\n\nI'm F16, and my brain has constant thoughts about harming others and myself. I started getting interested in unsettling topics that contained death, gore, and murder at a very young, around 11 years old. I was on the wrong websites and was talking to the wrong people online, and was also dealing with a lot at home. I was raised basically in a shit hole and around parents that constantly argued and broke everything.  I started self-harming regularly and cutting myself with anything any chance I got. I genuinely looked forward to it and it became such I big comfort for me. I was addicted to it for a while.\n\n Although already taking part and viewing violence and harm, middle school was when I started getting those thoughts about other people. Middle was extremely hard for me to deal with. I constantly was bullied, starved myself, self-harmed, and I just couldn't feel alive. I was so alone with my thoughts. I recall having many memories of sitting in class fantasizing about getting caught in a shooting, watching someone take their life from the roof, bringing a weapon to school to being violent to my classmates. I started forming a hatred for the world around me, I couldn't allow myself to befriend others. I felt like no matter what I did I was never truly happy. \n\nThen COVID hit and I became homeschooled for the rest of my middle schooling. 7th grade was when the thoughts and fantasies became even more intense. I was isolated from people and the world. I only was at home, which wasn't always the best. I couldn't sleep without creating scenarios of killing myself and being violent. It oddly soothed me. I was failing my classes for not having any motivation. I couldn't get myself to do anything, the only thing on my mind was death. Nothing mattered to me anymore, nothing had a purpose. I was miserable with life and wanted these thoughts and feelings to go away. I was tired. I started taking showers in the dark to avoid looking at my body and to self-harm. I wore baggy and long clothing. But I just couldn't stop. \n\nThis cycle repeated itself throughout 8th grade as well, but slowly got a tiny better in my freshman year of public high school. I would between 1-2 month periods of not self-harming instead of every day. Although my fantasies about hurting people were still strong. \n\nI thought I still hated the world and everyone with it until I met my first girlfriend. She continues to be the only one that makes me happy and I don't get violent thoughts towards her. She's like a miracle. I even stopped self-harm after being with her and have been 6 months clean which is the longest I've been clean since 11 years old. I continue to get awful awful temptations about self-harm but I've worked through them; my suicidal and homicidal thoughts just do not go away. I am 16 years old, and I'm afraid that my future will consist of me spiraling into a dark hole. And I'm afraid my only sense of happiness, my girlfriend, will leave me one day. I know for a fact I won't be able to handle it. \n\nI'm tired of being sick and I'm tired of being unhappy.",

You have the chance now to get help to change and have a long happy life free of these thoughts. Seek therapy and go to a doctor about this.\n\nI\u2019m not going to sugarcoat and say this is normal, but I do wish you the best and hope you get the support you need and deserve.",

I suggest therapy because you probably need a professional unwarp your thinking.  \nIt is a good thing to be clean from self harm as long as you have been. Congratulations on your happy relationship. If the good relationship motivates you use that motivation to get help. I had suicidal thoughts for years and it took a few therapist to help me. Finding a good one may take time.",

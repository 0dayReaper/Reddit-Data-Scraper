    "postText": "I don\u2019t know who to talk to so why not a place where I don\u2019t know anyone. I have always wanted to be a nurse and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to school for. I just got my first job in the healthcare system. I\u2019m currently in training and today was my very first clinical. I loved helping people and being able to give them some comfort. However, I am doubting myself. I feel like I won\u2019t learn fast enough or the patients won\u2019t like me once I\u2019m doing everything on my own. I actually feel kinda lazy when I\u2019m not working or studying. Part of me feels like I won\u2019t be able to make it as a nurse but I want to. Is it normal to feel this way when just starting (for any career)? I feel better getting it out but I\u2019m still nervous and anxious about it.",

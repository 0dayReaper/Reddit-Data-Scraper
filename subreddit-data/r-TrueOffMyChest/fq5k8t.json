Most people become much friendlier because we're all in this shit together so a few quips to strangers help and then there's those that panic with their heads down. \n\nPeople are in that friendlier mood so quick jokes or back and forths giving each other tips are common. I've had people comment ask about a specific type of shrimp I was buying and ended up telling the guy how much better than the average while sharing a quick recipe. That doesn't happen normally. \n\nI've gone to walmart 4 times in the last 3 weeks and everyone is genuinely more attentive to those around them. The side effect I'm noticing locally is that older people are relishing the extra conversation. There's always groups of 70+ aged people walking around with carts that just have a pack of donuts or something trying to talk to everyone. \n\nI walked in yesterday and there were 6 people with an average age above 70 talking to each other in a small circle by the front door. They all had carts with things like a pack of kitchen towels, the donuts I mentioned, a dvd, etc. I overheard one say that he just wanted to get out of the house for a little and the rest agreed.\n\nHad to buy a few things at Home Depot and an old lady was trying to walk around a pull cart set by the register to keep people apart from each other. When the cashier told her she had to stay behind that other cart she rolled her eyes, waved her hand and said 'oh because of that corona thing?\n\nPeople are fucking dumb and don't get it.",

Most of my coworkers don't take it seriously, either and think cleansing the carts and keypads and counters is stupid. What's stupid is that the employees health AND customers health is entirely disregarded.\n\n\nSorry for ranting, I'm just about to start my shift and the Plexiglas shields they're supposed to put up are simply just a PR move absolving them if responsibility if one of us cashiers gets sick.

I had an older lady and her friend walk so close we brushed shoulders so she could stare at the condiments next to me while standing less than 24 inches away. I watched an older man decline the store employee sanitizing his cart handle when grabbed one. And I've noticed that older people are more likely to grab an item, read it, and place it back on the shelf. I'm over here busting my butt to keep my family safe by following the rules so I'd appreciate everyone else put in a little effort too. It baffles me that older, more vulnerable, people aren't taking this seriously. Equating it to having been through war as a young person is dumb. Yeah, this might be a war but this time the enemy soldiers attack from the inside, where you have minimal defenses.",

The closest thing to a war at home the vast majority of people have felt was 9/11 which was a single attack. Prior to that it was pearl harbor and the aleutian islands (weren't even a part of the US at the time) 80 years ago. \n\nIf 10% of New York State gets the virus and it has a .5% mortality rate (going on the german tests vs death rates), that's more than 3x the deaths than 9/11 in NY state alone. Many patients are intubated for 3+ weeks so the more cases that require intubation, the higher the death rates a la Italy and Spain. Italys closed cases are at 45%. That would mean that if 10% of NY state gets confirmed positive and Italy's numbers for resolved cases are the reality because of the lack of supplies, NY alone will have almost 880,000 deaths at 10% confirmed cases. Italy's numbers were so high because they couldn't get enough supplies and they've had to prioritize patients. My uncle/aunt in Spain are seeing the same thing happen there. The death rates in Italy/Spain aren't that high because the patients are older. They're that high because there isn't enough for everybody so respirators are prioritized. If you're 70 years old and a 20 year old comes in that has a higher chance of survival, they're often prioritized. The 95 year old lady that survived in Italy didn't need to be intubated, she was the oldest but she didn't require the supplies that people an eighth of her age have required. Here, the government is walking away from half priced respirators because of the price while Cuomo is saying that they're going to need 40k respirators. \n\nTo put those numbers in further perspective, the US lost between 400k-450k in WW2.  Korean had 36. Vietnam had 58k. Afghanistan/Iraq had 52k combined. If 10% of the US is tested as positive and there's a .5% mortality rate...Thats 164k people. If it's on Italys resolved cases, that's 1.48 million, 3x the amount we lost in WW2. \n\nGermany has these low numbers because they started testing back in mid January and isolating cases very early. I hate to say this but I think this is going to get very, very gnarly.",

I'm on the mainland of the Space Coast, south of Kennedy Space Center/Cape Canaveral and just mainland of Patrick AFB. I've lived here basically my whole life. \n\nWe were the place that the weather dude was saying us and our children were going to die if we didn't evacuate a few years ago for Irma. Jim Cantore was here that storm. \n\nOn one hand, we have a lot of turnover. My street has 10 houses and 3 of them haven't been here since the last hurricane. We commonly go a few years without any major storms so people get complacent. Hurricane supplies often also get repurposed as well. We couldn't get sandbags for Dorian so we bought potting mix that is now our vegetable garden 7 months later. I've cut down a couple of sheets of hurricane wood for random projects around the house over the last year as well.  If we need to buy some new ones, we will. \n\nThe major thing is the hotels and businesses though. If a stronger storm is coming most people are going to want to get stronger boards so there'll be a small run there. Most businesses wont bother if a storm isn't strong though. Last company I worked for had me install 30+ sheets of wood across the front for Irma. When a storm like that comes around, all of a sudden every business also needs wood and it causes larger shortages. Overall you might replace boards every 4-5 years in a house if you have them labeled and ready but a business isn't likely to sacrifice space for 10-150 boards. For some of them it's actually cheaper to buy brand new boards every few years when they're needed than storing old boards for years until they're necessary.",

Me and my flatmate at the time both caught it. Two early 20's blokes stuck in a tiny flat together, sweating, coughing, pounding headaches, less than zero energy, both of us sounding like Wheezy from Toy Story. Had my dad post TamiFlu through the letterbox that we then nigh on crawled to the door to fetch. Supermarket delivery guy would kindly put our shopping in the fridge for us if we left the door unlocked - can you imagine that now?!",

I've got a cold? Nah, odds are you report flu symptoms, or mention the word flu, because it's something employers have to listen to - somewhere some time back someone realised that if someone really has the flu, they have to stay off work or your whole workforce is fucked. But then they realised people will start calling everything the flu, because that's the magic word for \"come back after the weekend\". So everything gets noted down as the flu and after having just a cold (or a hangover) the employee is back at work. So draconian sickness policies get drawn up and now both sides are going about everything all wrong.\n\nAdd to that our work culture, where anything short of imminently life threatening is seen tantamount to playing truant from school rather than an adult making a grown up decision to stay at home in the interests of their own and their colleagues health, and you've got this mess where people do start calling every illness the flu because it's suitably serious to head off direct questions, and nobody ever believes them because 9/10 times it isn't the flu.",

It doesn't matter if it has a low chance of killing you the point is to keep the situation in control and let it unnecessarily get out of hand over dumb selfishness.",

When I go in public, I never fail to have at least one person laugh at me and multiple others talking amongst themselves about how \"It's ridiculous that some people are acting like it's the end of the world.\", pointedly at me.\n\nHow about: I don't want my partner and mother to die? If I got sick, they'd definitely get sick and chances are edging toward almost 50/50 that one of them would end up dying.\n\nFor f's sake! Every time I see someone give me that mocking smirking face I just can't stand it. It happens multiple times each time I go in public.",

            "comment": "Seriously!! I'm not personally not at risk but I have a sweet elderly neighbor that is terminally ill already. Her immune system is compromised from her chemo and her doctor had told her she can't see anyone for any reason bc it's too dangerous for her. \n\nWell she steps out to get some fresh air, goes to her little patio and has a smoke. Meanwhile one of our neighbors tried to bust in her door, I'm assuming for her cancer drugs (seedy area). Little apartment complex and most of us know shes sick. She calls me freaking out bc now maintenance and the police have to come to her home. \n\nAnother neighbor of ours is \"fixing\" the lock. He's just looking at it and continually describing the same busted door that I see. I told him she's in questioning and needs her door shut. So, he proceeds to step into her home uninvited and I asked him, what are you doing, she can't see anyone right now. He steps in further to get her attention but she's on the phone talking to her son while having a panic attack about the whole situation. \n\nHe steps in further so now I'm shouting at him to get the fuck out. Finally he leaves and says, \"you know this whole thing isn't even a big deal. Did you know it's basically just a bad flu?\"\n\nI wanted to spartan kick him until oblivion... How dare he put someone else at rid do just to prove a point! What if she got sick?! I'm sure he wouldn't have even think it was himself.",

More and more shops are shutting and others are having huge sales. \n\nI sell board games. Business is booming. I'm a little terrified to call and cancel work because while we have a program for government help it's an absolute nightmare to get on. We're not looking at closing, hell the boss isn't even cutting down hours. Which is great we have shifts and money but God is it scary. \nLate night Thursday we were one of only two or three shops open after 7. And we still had people coming in. I just dont know what to do.\n\nI couldn't believe the people today. We're almost always at capacity. We can wipe down the games as they come in but people touch them to see what they want and there's nothing we can do for the stuff on the floor.\n\nI had a 70yo woman today and yesterday living in a retirement village absolutely fuming that they can't have visitors or go swimming or play bridge. Same woman won't buy a jigsaw if it's made in China but she'll spend all day at the shopping centre. The way some of our customers joke around about it makes me sick and others are coming in, spending hundreds of dollars on games, and then i see them again in a day or two.\nI don't know how to break the customer service role and tell them to get the hell home and stop shopping.",

My last contact with the first exposure was last Wednesday, 10 days ago, to a confirmed positive, and this week I've had contact with a person who ended up showing all the symptoms who's wife had a positive test but he kept coming to work because he, \"needed the money\". What's pissing me off is talking to older relatives and in laws who are more worried about their fucking elderly cat dying than our fears. We're both 36 and live in snohomish county washington, very near the epicenter of the WA outbreak. \"You're young , you'll be ok\", They say. Bitch, a 41 year old community transit bus driver just died from this shit. I really don't give a fuck about your dying elderly cat or your stupid fucking remodel of your house on 5 acres in BFE.",

I never thought about my age but this forces us to see mortality AND realize that our age could have us killed.",

Same with toilet paper. \n\nYesterday, I dropped my parents car at their house (had to borrow theirs as ours had been stolen the week before). My nephew was giving my husband and me a ride home. His girlfriend was with him. I was in the backseat and his truck is loud, so I occasionally would lean in close to talk to the girlfriend. Al.ost home, she tells my husband and me that she is now working the Covid unit at the VA (which is now taking civilians). So, basically, it came down to she had just got off an 8 hour shift, ran home, changes clothes in the garage, no shower (she told us all this), and then allowed me to get that close to her in a confined space after her exposure. I self quarantined now. Thanks for the heads up, asshole girlfriend!!",

Your parents should not have been at your house, or they should have stayed if they already were.\n\nb. Your nephew should not be hanging out with his girlfriend unless they already live together.

    "postText": "literally the title, the most digusting sick sorry fuckers i have ever met in my whole life with the most inflated ego's.\n\ni did NOTHING WRONG. all i did was try to be friends with people. and i did. i was. i was friends with this main friend group of 7 girls and they were nice enough even though i was so discluded all the time i still listened to their issues and problems and gave them stuff and was so sweet. i treated them like we were friends for years on end, only to have them treat me like a stranger.\n\nhere's the problem and how it began\n\nits first break, they ask me who's group i will be in for our graduation field trip to an amusement park (minimum group is 4 and maximum is 8) i'm not sure why but they just didnt want me in their group even though they had 7 people and they were on good terms with me. we are meant to be friends here btw, not strangers. we hang out at breaks and talk. \n\nnow here's what happened\n\nits first break (we have two in the day) i can notice them whispering between themselfs and i get the gut feeling its about me. they all just go running away from me saying their \"playing tag\"  and we meet up again at the portable where they ask me who's group i'm in for the trip. i say i dont know yet and they give eachother a knowing look and suggest i go be in a group with the most hated girls in the grade (who are hated for a good reason). they all of a sudden run away from me again and say their playing tag. i give up and go inside and spend the rest of my break in the restroom stall all alone.\n\nnow it's second break (each break is 40 minutes 20 to eat 20 to go outside to play) and i go walking around with one of the hated girls after i ask her to be in her group.\n\ni assume everything is alright and go on minding my own buisness. they call me over randomly and im happy and smiling and in a good mood for a bit. then they drop the most random thing to me ever. \n\nthey got their friend group and another friend group of 7-8 girls to all make some satanic ass ritual ass circle around me to tell me they dont want to be my friends anymore and to stop coming around with them at breaks. i have no idea what i did wrong. its not just that. its pure hatred they have against me. because if you didnt want to be with someone thats one thing. but laughing and pointing and making open insults to someone hurts. i have no one left anymore and i just dont understand why they did this. they never gave me a reason either. i went from waking up one morning excited to see my friends to walk home early holding back my tears getting pointed and laughed at. ive thought so hard about what i did and i dont care anymore. there was no reason. if there was they would've given it. i'm not gonna ask for one, because whats the point? fuck them, they can go rot in fucking hell. people who are born privelleged and use it against people to hurt them instead of help them. people who ruin someones life in 2 minutes and 30 seconds because they need something to gossip about that evening for a day or two. sad sorry fucks who can fucking rot. i truely hope from the bottom of my heart that these people find no joy in their lives. \n\nthere are just some people in this world born lonely, born to play the role of a clown always mocked and laughed at, and you dont get to pick if its you or not. i was unfortunate enough to be one of those people. \n\ni cannot fathom why you need like 16 girls to gang up on one person who has done NOTHING wrong to you and been kind to you. my entire world got flipped upside down in 2 minutes with no reason whatsoever. \n\nthey have a grade group chat with everyone in my grade boys and girls and all the girls are gossiping about me in there i assume which has my crush and everyone else in it. my crush already likes one of the girls in the friend group. i have nobody left. no one at all. and i cant even suffer alone. they have to point and laugh, because whats the fun if you dont? \n\nfuck them. fuck them. fuck them.\n\nterrible fucking people. fuck them.\n\ni wish nothing but pure hate and misfortune on them. fuck them.\n\npriveleged middle school girls born with everything. no disabilities, good looks or decent looks, a loving family, lots of clothing, money, warm meals, friends, popularity, and cold hearts. instead of using the blessings they have in their lives to help people, they destroy their lives and ruin them for a cheap laugh when they get home from school for a day or two. i fucking hate middle school girls. i'm a middle school girl too but i'm just the lucky pick for the one to ruin. hell is a teenage girl.",

The best advice I can give you is to continue to be nice to everyone else, and act like you don't care about the kids who were mean to you at all. The coolest thing you can be is unphased and not care. It's obvious and understandable that you do care, but looking and acting like you don't totally works.",

(until i was in the bathroom, something ive learned is that even if you never have ANYONE to talk to and absolutely have to bottle up how you feel to never bottle up how you feel from yourself and to be honest with yourself and your emotions)",

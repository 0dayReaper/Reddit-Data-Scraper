    "postText": "I took part in a car parade for a local man who was recently discharged from the hospital after a battle with cancer. \n\nHis wife arranged a surprise car parade of all his closest friends as well as the local fire department as a welcome home. It was a really sweet moment for him. He was all smiles and happy tears and hugging his wife. Really a touching moment. \n\nI jokingly said if it were my wife and I was battling cancer, she'd just push me outside and tell me what yardwork needed to be done. I said it as a joke, but the more I thought about it the more truth I saw in it and the more I realized how insanely miserable I am. \n\nI'm scheduling an appointment with a divorce attorney to start the process and see how screwed I am.",

They both get to experience the week day headaches and the fun weekends with the kids. Probably the best thing for maxing your time with them.",

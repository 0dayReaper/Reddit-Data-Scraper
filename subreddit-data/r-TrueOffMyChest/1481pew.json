    "postText": "Recently I've realized that I'm a shitty person for what I do. I used to think it but wasn't a big deal but now I know that I'm just being a douche. I am not in any type of serious relationship with anyone but I do often flirt and be suggestive with friends or coworkers, and a lot of them flirt back and are interested in me, even though I only flirted with them because I liked them in that moment. I hate myself for doing it because now I've given a lot of people false hope. I've never been the type of person to talk to a bunch of girls or be in many relationships but when I am spending one-on-one time with people I tend to be flirty with them regardless of our current relationship or if they're attractive to me or not. I didn't come here to make this post because I want sympathy. But I do want to get it off my chest and tell somebody.",

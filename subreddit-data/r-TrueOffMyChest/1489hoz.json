Just use the official reddit app. The only people you\u2019re hurting are the users.\n\nThe admins and owners of reddit do not care about a two day blackout. The amount of revenue lost is nothing to them, and since it\u2019s ending in two days, this will have no effect at all. \n\nBut do you want to know who does care, and does see the effect?\n\nThe users!\n\nOf course reddit wants you to use their app for their website. They made the app and the website.\n\nI can\u2019t wait until this is over, but then again all I\u2019m going to hear about is this black out for like a solid month and how everybody CaMe TogEtHeR tO oWn ThE cOrPoRaTiOnS!\n\nSometimes I really hate y\u2019all.",

I\u2019ve tried Apollo and didn\u2019t like it I found it fonfusing \n\nBut my stance on it is that the 3rd party apps are more accessible to the disabled than the main app. And if that\u2019s the case I\u2019d honestly rather people engage in the blackout. Sure it\u2019s inconvenient for us, but I feel like the disabled already get enough shit. \n\nIf Reddit is gonna remove 3rd party apps they should make this one more accessible \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.

Some subreddits are the best places to find info about various hobbies and job roles, for anything from specific application troubleshooting to caring for a particular kind of houseplant\u2026. and apparently a number of those are just temporarily private while some are on a longer hiatus (thought I saw one sub mentioning a week and another a month) and then some are getting permanently shut down.

But then, they are off reddit and *are objectively better off for it* so no big deal.\n\nI dont care about mod supports. Most of the large subs are seen by the same set of super mods. A single mod oversees hundreds of subs, so of course they want bots to do 99% of their iob. Thats why every sub just feels the same. Get blocked on one, twenty more random subs come in and block you too. Its the same basement scrubs that do nothing but sit on a computer and do this\u2026. For free often. If this \u201c\u201d\u201djob\u201d\u201d\u201d becomes hard and you dont want to do it then dont. But again, they need the bots to do all the heavy lifting for them. Otherwise theyll have to *actually sort through* thousands of problems and issues daily\n\nThe outcomes will be that the super mods fuck off and all these subs get unique mods that care about the forum and not sucking off admins. And if nobody mods then they close. Come the fuck on *its reddit* its not that big a deal if some subs close cause they dont have mods.\n\nBut none of that matters cause everyone will return to apathy and this \u201cprotest\u201d lol will do nothing. Just like all the people that \u2018left Netflix\u2019 over the end of password sharing, and ultimately Netflix gained more income and accounts than at the start of lockdowns. Total defeat for the protest. As for reddit, the protesters  *that are actually going to quit reddit* compromise only a shred of users. You know it, I know it, they know it, reddit knows too. Everyone will use the official app, theyll get over it, and theyll be back.\n\nThe people acting like being able to easily browse reddit is some kind of basic human right makes me laugh",

When they create policies that aren\u2019t agreeable to many or most users, we should stand up to it. Especially when it is all for the goal of creating more revenue using harmful and abusive algorithms (which all social media platforms use). \n\nReddit isn\u2019t a small grassroots company thats being ripped off, and needs your views, they\u2019re actually fine and didn\u2019t have to do this. It\u2019s all purely out of greed. \n\nThis post just got me cause it speaks to something much bigger than reddit. Many people have this same view and it\u2019s the exact reason why we will never see significant change in this world. We\u2019ve lost this sense of community and camaraderie. We are all just too distracted and self centered to come together, and rebel  against the corporate overlords. Many of us have been brain washed to believe that we have no power, and that our votes mean noting\u2026they do. But we only have power in numbers. It\u2019s time we start showing the ability to come together before it\u2019s too late. \n\nWhat this blackout will do to Reddit is minuscule. What it does: it shows that we mean business and that we\u2019re even able to do this at all. Yah, there\u2019s probably better things that we could be protesting but this is a start. \n\nNow I\u2019ll actually practice what I preach and close Reddit lol.",

They allow for integrations with other services, automated tools (like bots), analytics, and more. API's are an incredibly important part of the Internet ecosystem for keeping access open. Charging for api access alone isn't really a problem but setting prohibitively high prices is anti consumer as it forces users to go through reddit's app, which they have 0 incentive to make functional. It's a very dangerous precedence.",

I\u2019ll start by saying what that \u201ccop\u201d did was disgusting and I don\u2019t stand behind him at all he\u2019s a criminal and should be in jail. I became a cop because I truly want to help people in my community. I don\u2019t insult people and I\u2019m very level headed. Tonight there are many protests in my precinct and I know we\u2019ll be suiting up for riots. I don\u2019t want to be painted as a demon just because I\u2019m wearing a uniform. I don\u2019t want to be hated tonight because of what other officers have done in the past. I just want to come home to family safe and I don\u2019t want to have to fight with people who I don\u2019t want to fight because I\u2019m in blue. I just hope everything isn\u2019t too crazy tonight.",

Then you've got people who are just there to live out their stupid riot/anarchy fantasies and get a rush; out-of-state people who don't care about what they destroy, and unfortunately people who are so angry and fed up they wanted to destroy shit. \n\nTrust, the big corporations they've burned down were definitely part of the bigger protest, but the people who are part of the community usually try to protect their local businesses. Things are chaotic and get out of hand.",

It was after a serious car accident that left me permanently injured, with torn ligaments in my right (dominant) hand and after I'd had a concussion, lost consciousness, all of that fun stuff. When the cops came, one of them was kind and kept trying to calm me and my husband down; mostly focusing on me since I was the driver (accident wasn't my fault, btw - though it was absolutely horrific; I'm shocked we survived). The other one was on a power high, and he kept sneering at me and treating me as lesser - partly, and I very rarely say this, but I'm sure it's because I am a woman (because when he asked \"who was driving\" and my husband answered \"she was\", he rolled his eyes and said \"of course *she* was\") - not letting me even think through my shock. When I was trying to write my statement and couldn't even think rationally, my husband was trying to help me remember (example: I couldn't remember if I was in the left-most lane or second to left until after my head cleared, but the cop didn't let me wait. My husband was trying to help me fill in the details, which were spotty and inconsistent) and he barked at him to \"don't help her!\"; his partner just gawked at him. I could barely hold the pen because my hand was messed up, what with the torn ligaments and all, and he got angry at me and said \"can't you at least make it legible?\" It was just too much for me and I started crying; he rolled his eyes and said something like \"really? Tears?\". His partner actually called his name and said \"what the hell is wrong with you?\" I asked my SiL to write my statement for me while I dictated it because I could no longer hold the pen and he got angry, saying that that wasn't allowed. His partner intervened and said that \"actually, don't worry, go ahead and do that\", giving the other guy an angry look.\n\nSo yeah, there are good cops, and there are bad cops. It'd be nice if all good cops stood up for people like that other one did for me, but he wasn't always there... the other guy made so many other nasty comments, and I can only imagine how much other cops get away with when they think they can, if they want to. It was purely a power thing. The accident was already traumatizing enough; I'm still dealing with my injuries (had to have surgery and am still in a brace two years later), and was shaken from the car catching on fire, as well. I didn't need the assholery of that cop. And unless the \"good cops\" stand up for the citizens and speak out against the bad cops... then I don't really think they qualify as very good cops, themselves, to be honest.",

What about those prescriptions in that Walgreen's you just burned down? They're throwing rocks through the windows of small businesses. They're burning random citizens' cars. They're throwing rocks and bricks at cops that are just standing there. They're blocking highways that people and ambulances use to get to hospitals.\n\n\nProtest all you want. It's your first amendment right. You do *not* have the right to make innocent people's lives harder because you are angry.\n\n\nEdit: and just to be clear, I am very much in favor of the protests. I just don't find looting pharmacies and burning down post offices to be constructive.",

No signs, no chanting, just people jumping at the chance to grab sneakers from a burning building (Sports Dome) the looters and arsonists aren't expressing any particular anger, they're literally just taking the opportunity provided by enough people having the thought \"they can't arrest us all\" at once.",

But they won't do what happens in rural cities or towns. \nMostly because people are not dumb. However. I use to be a protestor before,  organizer. One thing the NYPD does which could backfire on you. Is they send antoganizers who often start fights. Disappear and hype up crowds. Specially the anarchist. The ones using the A symbol. \n\nHow do i know? NYPD did it in take over walls street protest, gardner protest , trayvon. \n\n\nSo my tip is. Let the protestors go. And actually help them. Meaning if there is traffic coming. Run and stop the traffic and tell the protesters to proceed. This may be against protocol. But a single action as such. Can really change the perspective of many.\n Be human. But your co workers decide to attack people. They can't be cool. Or do dumb shit like pepper spray random people. Then yes be scare. Outhere there is alot of young man ready, with hot blood. In a warm weather. Ready to let their anger flow. I can see it. Based on the protest. You guys don't be influence by your union. Be human. Be a police officer. Uphold your oath. But most importantly make sure to remind the rest of your co workers to uphold their oath of duty.",

A lot of people had their lives changed by good cops because they went above and beyond what's expected from them. Hopefully this protesting will change how our country handles bad cops, and some day in the future we could fix our disgusting prison system. Until.. what's happening is necessary.\n\nPlease go out into the field and protect the protestors.",

When you\u2019re a good person, it Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve done a thousand good things. One bad thing is the only thing you\u2019ll remember and it will nag at you for years. It doesn\u2019t even need to be something you\u2019ve actually done wrong. Like you could arrest someone for doing something illegal and they beg you to let them go because they have kids, but you can\u2019t because it\u2019s your job. Then he gets life in prison because it his third offense. You feel terrible because now his kids don\u2019t have a father and his wife has no husband over something insignificant. You thought the court was just going to give him a fine and your boss is now congratulating you for the arrest. Fuck\n\nImagine this shit happening every week in severely different ways just eating away at you until you can\u2019t even remember anything good you\u2019ve done or why you even wanted to be a cop. \n\nSo it doesn\u2019t matter how good you are or how well your intentions. Anyone is susceptible to becoming numb out of self preservation. \n\nOnly a few truly are humble and have the humility to accept things as they are and move past them and wake up new and refreshed. Ready to serve the people while also flipping a switch to incarcerate other people, men and women. \n\nAnd that\u2019s just for the GOOD guys. Then there\u2019s other people who are sick in the head. These people are dressed in all kinds of costumes. Politicians, doctors, priests, teachers, and cops. They pretend to be good and say all the right things or maybe say some shitty things veiled in humor that no one takes seriously. Little does anyone know that that sick fuck has been thinking of some way to abuse their power for more power, sex or just for the sick fucking fun of it. Then it happens and everyone\u2019s pointing fingers at the uniform. And the people in uniform are pointing at the people pointing at them because no ones got clean hands. \n\nPeople shouldn\u2019t be policing people for money. Period. That would weed out a lot of sick fucks. There should be zero profit going to the state or precincts. I don\u2019t know how the fuck police got control of traffic and are able to profit from it. Police should only be on call like firemen. There\u2019s absolutely no reason for police to be out looking for trouble. There should be no reason for a cop to not be trained and vetted and put through the ducking ringer before even being allowed to put a badge on. Let alone a fucking weapon. Ugh. \n\nThere\u2019s just too many sick people and there\u2019s no way to identify them until it\u2019s too late. Sure there maybe signs but good people like to forgive and forget while other sick fucks like to cover up and lie. So basically it\u2019s just a free pass for terrible people to keep doing terrible things. Until good people start making difficult decisions that go against their good natured intentions.",

But I also think, that the system shouldn't put their policemen in this position. Why does the criminal feels the need to do something illegal? Mental issues? Poverty? Maybe there wasn't proper education so he couldn't find a job? Why is there a 3-strike-rule? What about rehabilitation? And so on. There are different approaches to these things but I don't think that the US will change in these matters.",

I was in Minneapolis early today helping board up buildings in an area that was hit but not getting much attention when a group of cops rolls up and starts saying \u201cyou don\u2019t need to be here. Just let us do our jobs\u201d. Turns out they had a unit who was coming around to all the buildings in that neighborhood to board them up. Honestly they probably were better equipped to do it and could do a better job. But they acted like we were the enemy when we were helping out. Such a negative interaction when all we needed was a conversation. \n\nEvery interaction I have ever had with police has been marked by a total unwillingness to communicate. Once had someone get arrested in the gas station I was working at and the cop straight up wouldnt talk to me. \n\nIt sounds like you get this perspective though. Idk",

Nobody has called me a murder before but I might get that one tonight! lol. And it started because of the bad police officer in the best who would beat people for literally no reason and even do worse. Before there were cameras policing was terrible and I wish it was never like that now there is more accountability. Just imagine in 1970 something like this instance could have been swept under the rug!\n\n4. I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201cthe general stuff\u201d but I\u2019m assuming you mean have I had any excessive force and any allegations made against me. The answer is no And I don\u2019t plan to either.\n\n5. BLM is an important movement I just think sometimes it gets taken the wrong way and some people put hate in the wrong direction (at good police) but yes blm is an important movement and I fully support it.\n\n6. Man that\u2019s a tough question I wish I had the answer lol maybe educate the public more about the procedures of the justice system. Often times we have to arrest people we don\u2019t want to arrest but we have to due to procedures. Then the person becomes erratic and they are 100% right they shouldn\u2019t be arrested but I have to and then it\u2019s into the hands of the court system which they will release the person.",

This was very badly worded, I meant more as in \"do citizens act strange around you?\" and stuff like that, or accuse you of being racist when arresting a black person  or pulling over a black person who was speeding and stuff like that, this is one I've seen in comedy (I'm really sorry for it) \"change of plans, the target is black, I repeat, the target is black, we need a black cop to handle this\", ever felt even just a little like you had to do that?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n5. I have mixed feelings about BLM, all in all it reduced greatly (not sure if it's really the cause but I'd bet on it being so) the amounts of black victims of police brutality so I'm happy it exists, but then there's the danger of forms of abuse or some say even extremism (which I can hardly see but we must always be cautious when it comes to this kind of subject) coming from it. I have to say, I feel like it needs an update, I saw people using stats from years ago when the movement was founded and since then those stats changed a lot for the better.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n6. I've seen people saying that your laws are very permissive and that your legal system gives too much power to judges, and to rich people as a result, which is why some people are sentenced to life sentences for relatively minor crimes while others get away with murder. I was expecting you to address that to be honest, I don't know why, maybe since from my experience it seems like a hot issue, then I saw a case (a huge scandal actually) in which a sportsman shot and killed his girlfriend in his house at night (with a shotgun if I remember correctly) and it was classified as legitimate defence (it was dark and he didn't know she was there) a while ago and then I went to wikipedia to read what I could about your laws on gun control, because here killing someone because your gun malfunctioned still gets you with a criminal file even if no jail time, I might have misunderstood this, feels like I must have, but I've read that certain types of guns don't need registration and that blew my mind, and coupled with the laws on legitimate defence that unsettled me.",

The story goes, someone calls 911 stating a man is in the street waving a gun around this is about 3 am. The officers were right around the corner they see the man with the gun as described by the caller the officer order him to drop the weapon he does not he points the gun towards them they open fire hit him 3 times. Now right after that a very high up personal shows up and takes the officers guns, standard procedure to ensure their weapons are not modified in any way that is not allowed. The officer go to the hospital and they are given time off. I still haven\u2019t seen them. Their story is investigated and the scene is investigated by a separate unit. That unit decides if the officers acted within the patrol guide. This takes many months. If they were found wrong to shoot the man then they would be fired and tried in court. If it is deemed a good shooting then that\u2019s all there is to it. Hope that\u2019s a good answer",

All I keep hearing - and I do somewhat agree - is that it's far too easy to become a cop and there are many in the system that aren't all that intelligent.  Also far too many with anger issues (not to mention other mental defects) and a huge problem with racism.    \n\n\nNone of us can paint this picture with a broad brush.  Not every cop is shitty.  Not by a long stretch, but you have your work cut out for you.  There was already a great deal of mistrust from all sides and it's only going to get worse.",

If people would do things right this could be a way to change things. That cop should be charged and arrested but how does stealing from people who have done nothing wrong help",

I myself am looking to get into law enforcement and recent events have only strengthened my resolve. I have seen many videos of police officers who have been able to de-escalate tense situations with protesters by simply listening to their concerns and responding with sincerity and their own anger in the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmad Arbery. Rather than charging into groups of protestors with tear gas and weapons drawn, they appeared with humility and empathy. That\u2019s the kind of law enforcement officer I will aspire to be.\n\nI hope you stay safe on your shift and I hope you return safely to your family.",

It is mostly directed against the system and when good people (you're not only a good cop but also just a good person) like you actively show compassion and try to keep others in line everything can be more peaceful. There are photos and videos of protesters protecting cops and cops calmly trying to descalate the situation and these are the things that give me hope. \nJust remember that most people protesting are very hurt, angry and feel betrayed and showing compassion is what will help.\nEdit: I hope you and everyone there is safe",

It is a war you will lose no matter how much hi tech weaponry you bring. You may have not personally contributed to this culture or you may have, I don\u2019t know. \n\nIf you want to improve things you should work to changing your work place culture. Take a trip to Scandinavian countries and talk to police there to start. Encourage your coworkers to change their attitudes. Encourage your leadership to move in a new direction.",

    "postText": "My (23F) boyfriend (24M) have been together since 2016. He was a grade above me, and was more knowledgeable than I was. He is someone I looked up to then, and I still do but in a different way. After a year of college he dropped out, but I stayed in college. We moved in together, and he is working full time to provide my living expenses. I am taking care of my own schooling, but everything else he takes care of financially. Up until a year ago I was taking classes he already took, so I would ask him for help and it was great. I am going into environmental science, and all my classes left are all science based classes. Once I started taking my chemistry classes, he was no longer able to help me. I made more friends in my field, and we created a study group. Well, I\u2019ve noticed that anytime he makes a comment science related (like pH levels, climate change, renewable and non renewable resources, geological, etc.) hell get half of it right, but then will say something that doesn\u2019t make sense. Example is that he said we should be consuming water with the pH of 2 or less. When all water is 7, and anything below 6 is too ascetic for people to consume. When I pointed out my confusion, he got upset, and put his foot down that he was right. I pushed a bit more, then he started to ignore me. He then admitted after a few minutes of silence that he was upset because he was wrong. So I assume he googled it. Anyway, I\u2019ve started to realize the same pattern. He will get defensive and immediately shut me down if I voice that he is incorrect about something. I get not wanted to admit you\u2019re wrong, but it kinda hurts. He makes it seem like I think I\u2019m smarter than him, but that\u2019s not the case. Academically I may be smarter, but e is smart in every other aspect. He\u2019s not dumb, and he\u2019s honestly one of the most intelligent people I\u2019ve ever met. I used to love talking about new things or science stuff with him, but now I feel he may see it as me bragging now. I don\u2019t know how to go about talking about my interest in science anymore to him without him feeling like I\u2019m calling him dumb. I just find it fascinating and want to share it with him\u2026",

            "comment": "In my opinion, he's afraid of you getting the degree, having better job prospects, and eventually, inevitably leaving him, especially after he helps put you through school. Resentment, shame. And so he is taking what very minuscule control and power he has while he still has it, shamelessly. The ability to yell, because at this point, he doesn't even have the ability to be right. He also might regret dropping out while you soar. Sounds like a lot of resentment.\n\nAnd you said he's smart. He's probably smart enough to fear where this situation leads. But he also won't just let go of you. Obviously it's difficult to just end a relationship.\n\nAnd don't say you'd never leave him. He's a resentful bastard and you're about to have a degree. I don't even see why you'd force yourself to stay in the end (even if that's a couple years down the line).\n\nAlso, is his job dead end? If that's the case, he probably feels dead inside, and has trouble not comparing himself to you. In my opinion. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nFor both of your sakes, give him NO pity. If he has to cry about it, let him cry, and he will find a new path without you, and vice versa.",

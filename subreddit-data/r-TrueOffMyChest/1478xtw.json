    "postText": "I'm new and I don't know how to format this so just bear with me. \n\nI know it is stupid but it's eating me inside. I (20f)am jealous of my little sister (19f). Our lives haven't been great and I have always found an escape in my mind would it be just making up scenarios to make myself feel better or just listening to music and escaping reality. she has always been more outgoing and extroverted while I am more quiet and introverted, it hard for me to open up, this is partly because of my upbringing but also because I'm deeply self-conscious. the thing is she's everything I imagine myself to be when I'm \"daydreaming\" She's tall, slender, confident, with a great body and a lot of friends, and gets attention from almost every boy she meets. while me....im chubby, don't even have a best friend, and the guys that pay me any attention always press me to do things their way or just make me feel bad when I don't devote all my time to them. I know I sound like the most bitter person to ever live, don't get me wrong I love my sister even though she is inconsiderate of everyone's feelings but her own, even though she just wants to have fun and doesn't even bother to tell me where she is or even calls to tell me if she's even friking alive. I'm jealous cause I wanted to be outgoing and free but I was too busy studying or taking care of myself and her and now? I'm so depressed that even waking up is a chore, I'm failing most of my classes and I don't even know what I want to do with my life. I feel like a failure.\n\n it's funny it's not her fault but somehow I resent her for being the way she is so carefree. while I just think about how my family is doing, how she is, what my cousins need help with, or some other stupid things I can't stop thinking about. it also doesn't help that we have a way younger sibling and everyone keeps telling me I need to take responsibility cause even though I love my parents in my way they won't be able to.\n\nI'm a people pleaser I think is the term, im afraid how something I do might affect other people and their feelings, it's hard. I know I need to work on these thoughts, but I just don't know how. I keep seeing people who have a great relationship with their parents and it hurts because my dad has never even hugged me. it's just so lonely. sorry, I know I'm ranting but I just need to say these things, or ill just explode soon.\\\\\n\nI  suppose what prompted this word vomit is the fact that it's her birthday and her friends threw her a party to which I wasn't invited to, not gonna lie I'm salty, cause 1. Last year my friend and I gave her a little party, and 2. I have never had a birthday party not even a birthday cake(except for my 18th birthday when my cousin brought me a cake).\n\n don't want to keep ranting doubt anyone's gonna read this anyway so yeah.... bye and if you read it thanks for reading.",

If you love her but feel resentment there\u2019s a chance that she knows it had listened and would rather keep her distance so you don\u2019t feel bad or she doesn\u2019t feel guilty. But just like it\u2019s not your responsibility to care for anyone and it does sound like you are a people pleaser to get any kind of live or validation, it isn\u2019t her responsibility to take care of your mental health. I\u2019m assuming your parents are close with her either? If they are that hurts worse but if they aren\u2019t it sounds like she found a family of her own with her friends. And it sucks when you can because you are naturally more introverted",

You are putting yourself in this role that she is not asking of you. Sometimes when people complain they want empathy not solutions. You are not her mother and you sound like you think like you have to be because of your lack of parenting for both of you but you don\u2019t. Just be her friend, ask her for advice on how to come out of your shell. You don\u2019t have to be stuck in this cycle forwver",

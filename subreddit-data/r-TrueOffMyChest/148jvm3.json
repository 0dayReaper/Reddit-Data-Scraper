    "postText": "So, about 3 months ago, my sister noticed she had a lump in the back of her neck. After much persuasion, she finally went to the doctor and they have asked her to do a biopsy. Though the chance if it being malignant is not very high, we can't really rule out anything until the tests come in. \n\nI live in another country and she's all by herself there. I know that if it's cancer, I'll leave everything and go to her to help her get through that phase. But, I can't help but feel awful that she has to go through so much. \n\nWe lost our parents when we were very young. And my mom did pass away due to cancer. So my fears are heightened at this point. My sister raised me and has been a support system all my life. She's older than me (early 30s), unmarried and constantly has to battle tough situations. Last month, she fell prey to a scam and lost a lot of money. Now, she has to go through this biopsy and god forbid the results are positive, she'll be devastated. \n\nI honestly just want to scream my lungs out. She on the other hand is being so positive and is consoling me when I should be the one supporting her. How do I cope? Please tell me everything will be fine and that she will be fine.",

Even if there is something, the treatment is so much better now than it was years ago. My best friend was diagnosed with breast cancer in November and honestly, her positive, determined attitude is just astounding. She\u2019s doing well and almost finished treatment \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb don\u2019t lost hope OP. I really hope it\u2019s nothing and your sister is ok.",

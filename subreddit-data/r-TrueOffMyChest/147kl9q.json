Maybe make some comments and feel out how he might react.\nOr decide if it worth bringing up no matter the cost.\nI feel like honesty with yourself is a big step. Next is honesty with others. If it was me I would be super direct. I would simply say \"I would like to explore my sexuality with women. Is that something that you might be open to?\" Then give him time to think and digest and respond.",

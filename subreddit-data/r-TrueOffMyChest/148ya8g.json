    "postText": "My (20M) girlfriend (20F) just dumped me for another man she met in a bar a few nights back. We had been dating for over 4 years and throughout that entire time she always talked about wanting to build a family with me and be with me forever.\n\nBefore me she had a history of hopping from people to people and trying out different things, which I had no issues with when we started dating. We dated for a long while and it was pretty good except for a few things that I probably should have noticed sooner.\n\nNumber one is that unlike a lot of relationships it did not start off well. For a lot of the beginning I questioned myself if this is who I wanted to be with. She was very clingy to me and would keep me up at nights and get mad if I went to sleep.\n\nNumber two is that my friends told me these things too, and I didn't listen. I thought they were just jealous and I cut off a lot of relationships during this time.\n\nFinally number 3, my ex girlfriend who hated my guts reached out to me to tell me that she thought I deserved better and I should be careful. I obviously didn't listen to this.\n\nLuckily things mellowed out after the first year or so and we were good. I reconnected with a lot of my friends and everything seemed good for quite a while.\n\nThen the other night I was out of state at my dad's house helping him get around for a few days and she went to a restaurant with a few of her girl friends. She told me that a guy was there that hit on her and asked for her snap.\n\nI asked her if she took it and she said yes. I was very uncomfortable with this and I asked her to not talk to him and she said okay. The next day she asked for a break in the relationship. \n\nShe told me she thought she was losing feelings and she wanted to break up, but then decided a break was all she needed. I told her okay and tried my hardest to respect her wishes, but if you have ever been in a situation like that you can understand how hard that is.\n\nI ended up contacting her about little things like my dad getting around and how he was doing, but then my dad had pretty serious health emergency. He lives alone and has trouble functioning on his own so my and my siblings come and see him ever now and then to check in.\n\nWhile this health incident was happening I called my gf and told her. She asked if I was okay and we talked about it and eventually the tone of conversation changed. She out of nowhere said everything would've been fine if you left me alone then hung up. I was really scared so I kept trying to contact her.\n\nThen she dropped the bombshell on me that she wanted to break up, and not just that but she had kept talking to that dude from the other night. She's been cheated on before and we've never had a situation like this so I didn't question it, but she apparently has been doing this. \n\nIn the days since a lot of her friends have reached out to me to tell me that they are sorry for how I \"apparently \"got trapped in her manipulative personality and they were glad to see us apart. I didn't expect any of the sort from these people but I'm glad I heard it.\n\nBut finally as the title of this post says I just feel set free. I don't have to worry about anyone anymore, I don't have to check my phone every two seconds. I can just run free and do what I want.\n\nYeah I cried, and it hurt for a while. I think that's a given with anything I do. But even now just a week after that I feel free. Who knows I may spiral down again and not feel so good soon, but for now I feel like a new man.\n\nLuckily we didn't live together or share all that many things so it isnt hard for me in that regards, but I'm sure more longer lasting effects will appear in the days coming. Either way right now I feel great!",

She beat me a few times, so yeah. Anyways, a week later she left me for another dude and holy fuck I was so happy. But then she called me screaming that if I really gave a shit then I would have tried to win her over the dude she left me for, so that was confusing. Anyways, congratulations on your loss, my guy.",

    "postText": "For context, in Oct. 2020 I went in for heart surgery and had several seizures off the table to the point where they thought I was going to die. My mom swore that she saw me die on the bed as they waited for me.\n\nThree years later and I'm still alive, but I have always had some doubts about my life. \n\nIt started small with thought of, \"Is..that me?\",when I look at old photos myself. It sometimes feels like I'm looking at a clone of me, except the current me is the clone. \n\nI am just a replacement of their old daughter, the daughter they'll never get back. \n\nI have tried to bring this up with my mom. She tries to understand. She usually says that I'm her daughter no matter what, that it's just a part of the healing process and she likes the girl she has now.\n\nIt's nice to hear, but, I always have guilt of replacing her actual daughter. I don't have many memories of her middle school years or fuzzy memories of her past that I'm told is an actual memory.\n\nI'm just getting this somewhere, anywhere honestly.\n\nI feel so much guilt for something I can't control. It eats me up from time to time. No matter who I talk to, they all say it's just a part of the healing process and they like who I am now.\n\nIt just hurts sometimes when I hear that they prefer the clone instead of the original.",

I can relate what is happening to you.\n\nWhat I developed was something called pseudo Bulbar affect. Or Emotional Labiltity. I would display emotions I wasn't feeling, or wildly displaying the emotions I was feeling. They gave a pill for it after I told my neurologist.\n\nBut there is a lot I don't remember. Awkward at first with my wife, and kids.\n\nCan't give a hack for this. I had learned what they used to call transcendental meditation as a young man. Resuming that helped me. \n\nGood luck",

I know that if that day i didn\u2019t agree with my friend about them taking a break i would still be friends with them and miserable around them but i miss them so much, they were a piece of me. i don\u2019t deserve to have someone in my life who doesn\u2019t feel the same but i miss who they were and what we used to be, maybe it\u2019s a little my fault i should\u2019ve backed off busied myself with something but i didn\u2019t.",

            "comment": "I had a friend just like this. They self-sabatoge their friendships and will always make you fell lesser when they are in a relationship. Is this the first time she has basically disappeared? My guess is no. My friend used to basically stop talking to us and the only come back when her boyfriend had fucked her over. She ends up with the ones that aren\u2019t faithful or worse and as silly as it sounds most of them you could tell were not good men. My best friend and I officially cut her off after her boyfriend cheated on her and left the bar with another girl leaving her there unable to even walk and was carried out and taken home by his friends (we were not there but she told us so we have first hand accounts). She proceeded to get back with him the next morning. We couldn\u2019t be apart of it anymore. Trust me your friend won\u2019t be there for you in the same way you are ever. Its for the best even if it doesnt feel like it.",

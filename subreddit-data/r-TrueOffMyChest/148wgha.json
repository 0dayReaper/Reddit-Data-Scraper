    "postText": "I've always struggled with suicidal thoughts. The first time I remember having them was when I was probably 10. But, after moving into my own apartment, and realizing just how empty life really is, they've gotten worse. It feels like every night I cry myself to sleep now.\n\nI just got a job at Walmart and of course I'm worried about it being stressful and unfulfilling, which it probably will because it's a college job. And it's Walmart. College just feels like a drag every day I'm doing it. The only days I find myself not thinking about suicide is when I'm with people I already know and love. Any other time I'm just angry at living.\n\nIt doesn't help that my mom has spent probably 3000 dollars on helping me move into my apartment, has been super helpful my entire life, and has always been an amazing person. At this point I'm only living for my best friend and my mom, and I just want to be willing to live for myself, but I can't. Every day I wake up and see myself in the mirror and just want to stick a gun in my fucking mouth and blow the back of my head off. \n\nI've tried therapy but all it does is make things worse. It makes me realize that my dad was always a dick and it isn't a new development, it makes me realize that my mom isn't perfect which sucks because I adore her, and it makes me wonder what exactly I'm doing here. I feel empty. I'm nothing and I'll never be anything\n\nI guess, TL;DR I'm terrified of living.",

    "postText": "Throwaway account \n\nTW: Emotional abuse, gaslighting\n\nI wasted four years of my life with an abusive mooch. As someone raised in an emotionally abusive household, I thought I would recognize all the red flags. I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sharing this for those of you who are being taken advantage of, for those of you who may not recognize the signs of abuse, and for those of you looking for a way out.\n\nBack then, every time someone would say something negative about my boyfriend or his actions I would counter them insisting that he wasn\u2019t smart enough to be doing it on purpose. In my mind, that made it okay. I was na\u00efve.\n\nWe had been dating just a few weeks when his apartment full of roommates got evicted. My roommate was in the process of moving out, and since he had rent in hand, I stupidly let him stay with me a while. At the time I expected it to be temporary, but as his ex-roommates moved back to their childhood homes in other states I should have seen the writing on the wall. He didn\u2019t have a car or a driver's license. I should have seen that for the second red flag that it was. I now had a dependent.\n\nHis job was only part-time. Knowing that his expenses were about to go up, I suggested he get a job at the convenience store down the block. He did, and I thought things were going to work out okay. For a short while, things were good. He didn\u2019t make enough to cover his half of the expenses so I made up the difference without complaint. If his hours were cut, those times he got fired (repeatedly), I made up the difference. He never once had any concern that he wasn\u2019t carrying his weight. If roles were reversed, I would have been very aware of the imbalance and I would have worked on making it up somehow\u2026 but I digress.\n\nEarly on, he accused me of financial abuse. He gave me every penny he made and had nothing leftover for fun so he claimed I was being unfair. I could afford to buy things for him, myself, and the house, but he never had any money left over to do the same. In his logic, this had nothing to do with the fact that I had held down a job for a decade getting all the raises and promotions that come with longevity. I had money; he didn\u2019t; that was unfair and my fault. He made me feel so guilty. I gave him cash when I could, even letting him keep his tax returns even though he still wasn\u2019t pulling his weight. He even got fired a few times, and while I had to get a second job to compensate, his lifestyle never changed. He was the financial abuser.\n\nDuring our years together, he learned about my medical history. He used this as a weapon. He told others private information. He gaslit me. He told me no one would want someone with the history I had, and I was lucky he even wanted me.\n\nHe weaponized his incompetence. It took me years to realize it. YEARS. He\u2019d claim ignorance when I asked him to do anything. I spent so much time covering his half of the workload. He didn\u2019t know how to do anything, or I could certainly do it better.\n\nFour years into the relationship, it all clicked.\n\nI asked him to hard boil some eggs for us. He said he didn\u2019t know how. I explained that I could talk him through it, and he froze. He, who had done this many times before, claimed he had no idea how and wasn\u2019t about to take instructions. That was it. Everything clicked. This asshole won\u2019t even boil an egg for me. Four years together and he can\u2019t heat a pot of water. For four years I lived like a zombie. I did literally everything for two people, and never had the favor returned. I had all the emotional work, and the physical.\n\nBreaking up was hard. Not pulling the trigger but following through. He\u2019d regularly gaslight me, and threaten suicide with the caveat that it would be all my fault. He hurt himself and threatned to call the police and tell them I had attacked him. I believed every word. I danced around his moods and threats and held my ground. He took all of \u201chis\u201d things and plenty of \"ours\" aka mine in the process. I had to \u2018help\u2019 him find a place and move all his shit. I had to find my own place too. It was worth every second. After the break I felt like a weight had lifted. I never felt so happy or free in my entire life.\n\nLooking back it was obvious that I was abused, but for some reason it wasn\u2019t so easy to see from the middle. Has anyone else ever been there?",

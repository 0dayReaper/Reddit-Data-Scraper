I.E when people haven't had their sterility check. It takes 40 ejaculations after a vasectomy to clear out the sperm in your ejaculant. \n\nMy dad had a vasectomy 22 years ago after my brother was born.\n\n3 of my colleagues have vasectomies, have done for years, no more kids.\n\nI just had mine last week, you get a sterility test 4 months later to check you have no active sperm. Then you get signed off as infertile. \n\nYou're only fertile again if the tubes reconnect, which is a less than 1% chance. \n\nThat whole 1% chance of getting pregnant after a vasectomy is down to completing the procedure correctly or having the rare ability to rejoin tubes and unblock the areas that are cauterised shut. \n\nThat's better than a condom, that's better than any form of contraception. It's the closest possible thing to not possibly getting pregnant and still being able to enjoy a healthy sex life. \n\nWho the fuck wants to abstinent?",

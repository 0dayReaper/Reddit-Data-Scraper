    "postText": "I have never had any debt. I put a friend up on the sofa, after he spilt with the ex. In order for him to get his life together and get a private place to rent. She has given the debt collectors my address. After the first letter, i told him he must leave. And i rung to say he doesn't live here. Hes supposed to leave on the 30th. My father just died and i have to return to Essex to deal with family stuff. Im worried that baliffs could come and take my belongings especially as hes awful at remembering to lock the door. \nI've just had another letter warrant of control and notice of removal of belongings even if you you aren't in attendance. Can they do that for someone that isn't on any documentation and is just a sofa surfer. Or do i ask him to go to the emergency housing people tomorrow. He said he ring the debt people on the 2st of july once he's left. I live wales by the way. Please help x",

Especially since he's been there as long as he has.\n\nYou need to get up with these people immediately and let them know he doesn't live there. He just crashed on your sofa a \"couple of nights\". He is not a resident, is not on your lease, and if they come into your home you will file theft charges.\n\nI would NOT leave town with him still there! He could just give them your stuff to pay off his debt.",

Text messages between the two of you can be a start but it\u2019s really really important to make sure that you have evidence that you bought the things in your house.\n\nEdit: my brother had this problem and I helped with the contact with the authorities because my brother was really sick. The authorities will work with you because they do want to take the right things but you need to contact them and be very clear and have evidence. I showed them the rent agreement and had evidence for the expensive things on the property.",

    "postText": "maybe failing to be more specific, i had this friend that really really liked. She and I were super close, and although we had just met in that year, we naturally grew closer and closer.\n\nFor a lot of the people that knew our frienship, it could've passed as relationship even, but we never crossed that line and we both had nice partners.\n\nI loved her so much, she was my inspiration in so many senses, and she helped me get the courage i needed to face my fears. I heard her cried, and she help me get stuff done. I always though how perfect we were to each other. She was everything I could ever ask for.\n\nShe taugh me how to be brave in some moments, and I helped navigate her relationships, offering my support and comfort. We were just good for each other.\n\nBut then, when she got a bf, everything started going downfall. I don't blame her bf, and I never blamed her for being in love. But I couldnt never understand how could she change me so easily.\n\nThe time went by, I would hear her and she would her me, but everything felt different. It was like a part of her was missing.\n\nWe slowly stopped talking so often. We would talk, but it would be short. She needed help, and I offered it her. But then, it was silence.\n\nI decided to break things when I felt so lonely that I cry in my bed trying to think a reason of why we were where we were. \n\nAnd I miss her so much. \n\nI think I just miss her presence, but she was so unique that I don't think I could ever forget about it. \n\nI loved her with all my heart. I grieved her so much.\n\nAnd I know where you are now, I know where to find you and how. Part of me wanted to forgive you and take your hand so bad again, but I could never understand why you did what you did.\n\nI love you so much, but you made me feel so unloved for no reason.\n\nI truly wish your happiness, it's what you deserve.",

Tell her you cared about her a lot and didn\u2019t appreciate how she treated you. You\u2019ve got nothing to lose and even if nothing comes from it, you\u2019ll get some closure.",

She might have picked up on it and since she's in a relationship, she tryed to let you down slowly.\n\nI'm still a bit confused on to what she actually did to \"fuck up the relationship\", it simply sounds to me like you slowly drifted apart due to her being in a relationship.",

    "postText": "For context, I\u2019m your average 17 year old girl. Nothing crazy going on in my life. Besides I hate how I look, I\u2019m skinnier and smaller than most girls, I\u2019m 4\u201911 and 90lbs. On social media you see all these girls with a nice behind and some cute cherries and I have none of that. My boyfriend says he loves me how I am, but I can\u2019t help but think he\u2019s lying.. he said the other day I need to gain my weight back. I used to play volleyball and had some weight on me but not as much as I wished. I know he didn\u2019t mean any harm but its so hard for me to gain weight.. I tried going to the gym but after 2 months I hated it, the way I was forcing myself made me feel terrible. People tell me to embrace how I look and love myself, but I can\u2019t. I look in the mirror and think I look like a ten year old girl. I just wish I could gain some weight.. my mental health is terrible, my anxiety, I feel like everyone is judging me. I feel not enough. I want to be like other girls, I want to look my age, I want to put on cute clothes and be confident in myself. I don\u2019t want to look in the mirror and hate how I look.",

It\u2019s hard since I run my own business, I just need motivation and to stay motivated. I want to do this for me.. when I do things for approval I never commit.",

When I got pregnant with my first born I was 115 pounds and completely flat chested. And from that point to the point I am now I have fluctuated weight and size. It\u2019s so important for women, especially young impressionable women of your age, to learn that these bodies we are given are a gift. In any shape and size they come in. Confidence is the sexiest thing in the room and comparison is the thief of joy. You are not these girls on the internet, but you are YOU and that\u2019s something no one else can be. Love yourself, you deserve it \ud83e\udd70",

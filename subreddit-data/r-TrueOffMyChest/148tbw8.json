    "postText": "My parents divorced when I was 10(I am turning 21 this year), and it has scarred me. My parents were like every relationship, they loved each other but had their flaws. They were high school sweet hearts and have been together for 15 years before they divorced. My mom cheated on my dad, because she felt a spark with another man, in which my dad found out and decided to leave. I found hatred towards my mom, anger that she has torn my family apart. My siblings and I had to deal with living situations (going back and forth) and having to deal with terrible coparenting, as my mom would threaten my dad for anything since she wanted us. This did not help my relationship with my mom, as I only wanted to stay with my dad. My dad hid his sadness and grief, and always made sure that we were happy and loved. I cry thinking about how my dad had to watch us leave when it was my mom\u2019s week, or how he felt when he heard my mom was pregnant with her partner she cheated with. I always remembered my dad telling us at night to comfort us, that he will make sure they will work it out and stay together in the next life and we will all be their children again. He cried a lot when we were sleeping. \n\nNow that I am older, I have come to terms about my mom\u2019s situation with my dad, as my mom felt a new type of love and support from someone else. I can not deny that\u2026 but now I am scared to love someone. Scared that it may turn out to be a situation like my mom or dad. To be cheated on, or to find another love within a current relationship. I am scared to marry or have children because I don\u2019t want to repeat it. I heard from everyone around me that children with divorce parents will grow up to be the same. I am scarred and scared. Anyways, I just wanted this off my chest, because I felt a bit sad about turning 21 soon and thinking about future plans.",

My advice to you even though you didn\u2019t ask is to live your life. You aren\u2019t your mom or dad, you are you. You can and should learn from their mistakes. Part of growing up is dating and yes breaking up because not everyone will be the right person for you. \n\nRemember there are no guarantees in life. You may do everything right and still  end up getting divorced or cheated on. Or you may find that one right person who will be with you your whole life and will make your life amazing. Live life to the fullest, love freely and don\u2019t lose sleep over something you can\u2019t control. Good luck and God bless.",

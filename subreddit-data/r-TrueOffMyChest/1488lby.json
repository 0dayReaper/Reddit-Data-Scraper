    "postText": "Some context- I(m27) am married to my wife(25), lets call her C for 3.5 years now, I love her infinitely, I legit can't sleep at night if she isn't at home for a few days [ she's at her parents, it's normal where I am from].\nMy friend(f27) lets call her Y, we got acquainted when she married my school friend, call him A, they were married for around 4 years, turns out he was cheating on her the entire time.\nI am explaining the timeline to give a better view of what happened\nThey got married in 2017 and I got married in 2019 so I knew this girl for 2 years before I met my future wife, at the time I knew her just as A's wife.\nThen covid hits my country in 2020 and just about when the country was opening up, A got caught and they started living separately.\nI supported Y through it and my wife knew about it the entire time and both of us got close to Y\n\nA and Y got separated and divorced. The POS got married to his GF the next year \n\nY was living with her family understandably was torn apart and she took time off everything. She was talking only to 2 or 3 people outside her family, I am one of them.\n\nWhen Y started getting better, me and my wife went to dinners with her, we even planned a vacation when the second wave of covid hit my country\n\nDuring this time I started getting attracted towards her. There was one night during her brother's wedding she got drunk and texted me late night, it was the weekend so I was up late, my wife was sleeping, Y and me got to talking, there was a little flirting. Nothing more than that happened. Both of us forgot about it in the morning.\n\nShe met someone in 2022 and she got married 6 months ago and I was happy for her, both me and my wife attended the wedding\nNow last month me and my wife  went out with her husband and I felt the same attraction towards her. I wanted to hold her in my arms and just kiss her.\n\nI felt disgusting and I was horrified at it. I don't want to acknowledge these feelings, I d rather they dint exist, because I consider her my family and vice versa, my wife also is good friends with her. I also don't want to lose her as my friend by avoiding her.\n\nI wanted to vent this here because I have never felt like this before, I had one girlfriend throughout my life, 5 years it fell off after and we broke up mutually, then my wife.\n\nI wanted this off my chest, hoping I feel better about it.\n\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nEdit- I am not continuously doing it. It was more than a year ago. And it was a few messages, nothing explicit. Just to clear any doubts about it.",

I\u2019m not giving you a hard time, but you\u2019ve been flirting with a woman that is supposed to be friends with you and your poor wife. It needs to end totally if you don\u2019t want to destroy your wife.",

    "postText": "I am too confused about my friends relationship they are bestfriends  of mine they tell everything about what they do. They are my friend for over 4 years now. And they are in relationship for more than 2 yrs. we are not more than 17. One day I was bored so i went to his place but he was not there and her place is just 1 floor below so i went to ask her. They both were there her mother was not home i was so awkward at that moment as were they. Next day they were in a huge fight and i got stuck between them. She is like my sister to me and she shares everything with me.I am just worried of a thing that they wont do anything wrong. Evry time they fights i need to patch them up together. They say some really mean things to each other when they fight. pls tell me what to do. Nowadays i am feeling like a third wheel between them,I am still single. When i see them i always kinda feel jealous not to them but to their relationship so i try to stay away from them when they are together as much i can but sometimes i just cant avoid it. I really need some advise about my role.",

Let them work their relationship out themselves, and if it doesn't work then it doesn't work. What you're potentially doing is keeping two people together that aren't good together. This isn't to say that you shouldn't be involved with them, but let them handle their fights (and potentially patching it up) themselves. \n\nAs for you feeling jealous, or a third wheel, you should get out there. If you think you're ready for a relationship then get out there and explore any connections you can. Just because they're your best friends, doesn't mean you aren't allowed to talk to anyone else.",

The longer you put it off, the harder it gets. Then next thing you know, you're a 30-year-old virgin that still gets nervous around girls.",

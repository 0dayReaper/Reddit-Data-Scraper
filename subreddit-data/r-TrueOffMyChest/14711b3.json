    "postText": "They are in their 60s and did NOT take care of themselves. I grew up on their diet, I thought water was \"gross\" and lived on sweet tea. Ramen was a staple for the kids. We weren't hurting financially, it was just the way it was in the 90s. \n\nI'm (33f) currently suffering from cancer. It's been a long journey and I'm about halfway through, fingers crossed.\n\nA few years ago, my husband got a job that required us to move around. My parents haven't \"been able\" to see me. I make all the trips to my hometown. My dad has back issues, serious ones, he's also morbidly obese. My mom has been diagnosed with numerous mental health issues, and she had become morbidly obese also. (I didn't know until I saw her). I HAD to take her to the grocery immediately, she didn't realize that my family doesn't keep TV dinners and soda at home. I tried to get things I knew she would like but it wasn't \"easy\" enough.\n\nThe both recently flew out to see me (at separate times). My mom is here now. It's about a 2 hour flight for them, but it put them in a lot of pain and at my house they are struggling. \n\nI have plenty of space but there's about 14 narrow stairs that go up to the bathrooms and bedrooms. Both of them have showered twice within the week they stayed. It was more noticeable with my dad, he was embarrassed and so were we.\n\nI love them so much, and I sincerely appreciate their effort. But what has me down is at their YOUNG ages, I'm realizing they probably won't come see me again. My dad is going in for yet another back surgery next month. And my mother is currently taking a depression nap. She leaves on Tuesday. \n\nMy cancer has taken a backseat to everything and everyone around me. But not my brain! I'm nervous and sad. Also, they've been divorced for almost 30 years, they've been in contact once. It's weird to me how similar they are.\n\nLove them to death but they aren't able to be around like i need.\n\nEdit: some words",

They\u2019re not obese but my mother is incredibly underweight at 78lbs, high strung and wouldn\u2019t be able to survive without my dad. My dad has back and neck issues and barely made it through the airport to come see me a couple months ago. Took him to look at some assisted living places where I live and he complained about them the whole time. I\u2019m early 40\u2019s and my parents are late 60\u2019s. I\u2019m having some health issues myself and I can\u2019t depend on them to help me because neither of them would really be able to help me because of how they are. It\u2019s sad because they\u2019re not old or anything, just did a bad job taking care of their health or learning how to do things independently.",

Or they're effectively addicted.\n\nRecently I heard that it may worsen or cause depression and anxiety, on top of all the physical problems it's implicated in.\n\nI'm sorry it's taking your parents from you, and that maybe it caused your cancer too.",

My dad was in cancer research, and he explained to me that usually with cancer it's a build-up of multiple small factors, most of which are basically unavoidable. It's hard to deal with the randomness of it, emotionally, I think. \n\nAnother thing that's hard, even when you're healthy yourself, is having parents who are unwell a long way from where you live. That must be particularly true when you keep moving yourself. Both things make it more difficult to build and sustain the friendships that can keep us going when we feel sad and nervous. For me that was one of the hardest things while I was looking after my parents in their final illnesses - my friends, home and usual life were several hundred miles away.\n\nSpeaking as someone in my 60s (older than my mother was when she died), your parents are theoretically not too old to make changes to their habits that would make them feel better and live longer. It's a vicious cycle when their weight makes it too much effort to prepare any real food, but it must still be upsetting to know that they can't make the changes even for your sake. Maybe it's worth having a conversation with them about that??\n\nWishing you the best of luck for your health.",

    "postText": "I (21m) was with my gf (18f) for almost a year. There are 2 main reasons we broke up:\n- we have different feelings towards having children, I'm pretty sure I want children someday and she is adamant that she never will (in the beginning of the relationship when this was briefly talked about I seem to remember her being more open to the idea)\n\n-our sex life went from great and frequent to not so great and infrequent, then to nothing for the last 5 months or so. Based on what she has told me, she has basically no desire to have sex due to depression, anxiety, and some resurfaced sexual discomforts, and potentially lowered libido from IUD(I'm still a little confused because everything seemed fine during the first 4 months or so and she has definitely used her vibrator to some extent in the past few months)\nEvery time I tried initiating in the past 5 months or so has failed and when trying to ask her about it and talk things through she'd get upset as if I was trying to pressure her or make her feel bad, which I never intended to do. \n\nThings were great overall in the first half or so of the relationship but her mental health started to decline as a series of unfortunate events began to happen to her (lost her job, had a bad mushroom trip, drifted apart completely from her only friend, lost a grandparent and a childhood pet). She's also just been through a ton of bad things in her childhood and past relationships so I'm really just trying to tell myself that this relationship failing isn't because of me not being good enough or not doing enough because I did my best. I'm just so distraught because I genuinely really love her and care about her and I know I'm going to miss her. I wasn't happy about various things regarding our relationship and regarding her but I wanted to stick with her and help her get better and keep loving her. I feel sick and weak and empty when I'm not occupied with something that takes 110% of my attention and I know the feeling will last for a while. I also worry about her, if she'll be OK. \n\nThis is just really hard and I have friends and family that I can talk to, but I just wanted to vent somewhere anonymous.",

    "postText": "My partner polybombed me about 4 months ago and a day later I walk in on them fucking someone else. They didn't even care enough to realise I had left the house until I called them from a mile up the road and then it was all \"oh I'm so sorry I hurt you I would never do it deliberately I love you it won't happen again.\" \n\nThen barely a few weeks later I walk in on them making out with a mutual friend. They were still making out with them when our roommate called an ambulance after I cut myself too deep. \n\nThey didn't even care about changing how they approach polyamory until I threatened to leave and then I'm hit with this massive lovebomb of \"oh I can change I'll make it up to you I never wanted to hurt you\"\n\nThey don't fucking care enough to change their behaviour because \"poly is so complicated, I'm sorry if you got hurt when I was figuring it out!\" \n\nPolyamory is too often used as a bullshit excuse for selfish, immature people to have their cake and eat it and if I never have to hear the stupid term again in my life I'll be happy.",

If OP has consented to be in a poly relationship then he/she should have mentioned it in the post too right? Reading this post makes it seem like the partner is only having sex and not OP. Sounds Very confusing to me. Should just leave rather than making it more complicated.",

But it is common for a polyamourous couple to see others that their partner does not, however their poly partner is their main partner.\n\nThe key point that you have is right on and important though, it is essential that the terms of the relationship are discussed and followed.  Open, closed, etc needs to be talked about, agreed upon and everyone following it just as strictly as a monogamous couple.",

My girlfriend when we first started going out would accuse me of gaslighting her and I would always say, \u201cNo I just have a different opinion than you\u201d. \n\nI think gaslighting requires malevolence, like you know you\u2019re lying but you\u2019re doing it on purpose. If the partner in OP\u2019s post is genuinely trying then it\u2019s not gaslighting, it\u2019s just polyamory and that couple\u2019s romantic journey falling apart. \n\nI think the crucial message is OPs feelings are valid.

Seems their entire life needs a reboot as there are no values to be had. No values often equals misery and despair...seen it too many times.  It also led me to go monk for 5 years in my own life until I could change entirely and operate from my person set of core values.  I initially responded to the poster's plea for hating poly, but if they are just as at-fault for the mess, it's on them to get out.  Hence trying to commit su\\*cide is certainly an indicator of a lack of mental stability, clarity and direction in life.",

Being caught off guard at them making out with someone they're both friends with tells me that they didn't discuss the partners involvement with them. In most poly relationships I've seen both parties are open about who they're with, it isn't done in secret and there should be no surprises. OP should have been given a heads up on their partners interest in their mutual friend. Instead they walked in on it with no warning. Poly relationship or not it sounds like OP's partner is just using it as an excuse to have a free for all cheating spree.",

I bet if there was a fly on the wall of the conversation the day before, there would be plenty.\n\nGaslighting is often subtle, but it doesn't have to be. It's just that's how gaslighting usually works best: slowly and over time. But in this case, OP is questioning their feelings that they want a monogamous relationship because OP's partner convinced them that their cheating is just 'polyamory'.\n\nThe mere fact that OP came into this discussion under the delusion that this is what polyamory is shows you all you need to know what this is. And OP's partner seems to have done this over the course of a single night. And in the 4 months since then OP's partner convinced OP that it's what they agreed to.\n\n--------------\n\n*Edit:* Removed gendered pronouns from the language because that seems very important to some people. Seems a lot harder to follow to me, but I guess I'm just too old to get it.",

Talking to them totally confirmed it\u2019s not for me, and I know people who have struggled with poly partners, but overall I think your comment is spot on. It\u2019s about transparency and mutual respect/care.",

Swingers are usually monogamous couples who decide to share their partners usually only at events and also usually with other married couples. It's often NSA and they don't really build relationships with the other Swingers beyond sex or friendship.\n\nPolyamorous relationships are relationships that involve more than two people. You might have three people in a relationship all together, or maybe more. \n\nOpen Relationships happen when those within a relationship decide that they can have other relationships with other people, but they still maintain a primary relationship.\n\nBeing poly and being open aren't necessarily the same. For instance, you could have a triad (a relationship of 3 people) but they aren't allowed to have other relationships outside the triad. That's not open. \n\nHowever, many poly relationships are open in some way.",

Especially if the motivation is to \"save\" the marriage, that sounds like a recipe for disaster.\n\nPersonally I think me and my ex could have been happy in a poly relationship as neither of us were prone to jealousy, I like women, and we had threesomes together before becoming exclusive. BUT only if we had initiated that before we became exclusive, it woulda been difficult after we had been monogamous for years. Ultimately what doomed us was mainly that my autistic ass couldn't keep up with his extrovert social butterfly ways, might have actually been better if we'd had a third that enjoyed that shit lol. Like \"I'm just gonna stay home and read, y'all go on without me! wake me up for sex when you get back \ud83e\udd70\"",

Some people though, expect praise and acceptance from a significant other after deciding they're a completely different sexuality or making drastic unilateral lifestyle changes.\n\nThat's not how it works. A person isn't society, they don't have to accept dramatic life changing decisions, transitions etc just because. I've unfortunately even seen people get flak for being upset their long term partners decide to transition to a different gender etc after years/decades of marriage. Like no...to each their own it's your right to do what you want with your body but it's not your right to completely change yourself and expect a partner to be ok with it just because.\n\n(And to those saying I don't need to add the \"I'm liberal\" part in...no I do. That's part of the problem, enough dumb dumbs looking for a fight don't read and just go straight into \"phobic\" name calling because that apparently works sometimes. *You* may have common sense, not everyone does and it's worth it to stave off the beligerant nutters)",

Seems very hypocritical to me. I also think it's ridiculous that the other commenters here are calling out OPs girlfriend for cheating and not calling out OP when he is doing the same thing himself. Like I get it, the OP is victim of cheating, but he is also a perpetrator of cheating, so I find it hard to side or sympathize with any of the parts here. Sometimes a victim can also be a perpetrator of what they have been a victim of, and that's not victim blaming, like in this case. Usually an abusive relationship is the result of both/all parties having unhealthy boundaries, which means they both/all contribute negatively to the dynamic. When someone recognizes the part they played in that abusive dynamic they can realize they're not just a helpless powerless victim at the mercy of someone else, but thst they are capable of taking back control over their lives. OP blaming his girlfriend and looking for sympathy on reddit hardly solves any of the issues he himself is struggling with. Seems he is trying to make himself feel better having people confirm his beliefs about his girlfriend and feeling sorry for him by painting a limited picture. Like you said, they all need therapy, and a lot of it.",

We all sleep in the same bed, and cohabitate like any other couple would, just with 3 people instead of 2. \n\nThis arrangement was something my husband and I sat down and talked about before talking to our girlfriend, and something we all sat down and talked about together before starting anything. \n\nWe put down clear rules and boundries that everyone agreed to before starting anything. \n\nYour partner isn't poly. They are just trying to get away with cheating on you. They want an open relationship and are just calling it Poly.\n\nThe fact that they are doing this in places where you can walk in on them in the act is even worse. They want you to see them for some reason. They are purposely trying to hurt you. Leave.",

Sounds like in your case and certainly in mine this is not the case. You can try and make it work but if you don't want it you'll only have more cause to spiral. And if, like what happened to me, a suicide attempt isn't enough reason for your partner to see the hurt they're causing then I really think you need to leave this relationship. \nIt hurts now but you can get through this.

            "comment": "Polyamory is not a declaration, it is an agreement. \n\nOne person in a relationship can't say \"I'm poly now, deal with it,\" and expect the other party to just accept it.  Would you buy yourself a new car from shared savings?  Rent a spare room in your shared home without asking?  Those are minor compared to the effects of polyamory.\n\nWhat you experienced wasn't polyamory, it was someone telling you \"I get to keep sleeping with you, but can also sleep with whoever else I want because I said so.\"  It completely ignores your autonomy, treating you like an object.\n\nA true poly partner is going to *ask* you about being poly with them, respecting your answer.  They are also going to ask you about limits.  Maybe you are ok with them having sex with a condom with others, but bareback is just with you.  Maybe you don't want them french kissing anyone but you.  \n\nEven if you accept (or even wholeheartedly embrace) being poly, it is ok to demand something be \"yours.\"  It could also be a day (they can have whatever fun Friday night or Saturday, but midnight on Saturday they turn into a monogamous pumpkin, spending time with you for the day).  It can be a place, (no one but us has sex on our bed).\n\nAlso, and this can't be stressed enough, you *always* have the right to say \"what you are doing is making me jealous/uncomfortable/insecure\" and renegotiate boundaries-or just say \"I need to be in a monogamous relationship right now.  You can wait until I am ready to be poly again (or accept that I am not poly) or we can find other people.\"\n\nI know this is long, but one last point.  Feeling insecure or jealous in a poly relationship isn't a \"bad\" emotion, it is an emotion, and you are allowed to have emotions.  Don't bury part of yourself to make a relationship work, discuss it.  You may be feeling \"disposable\" because your partner has gotten used to you in their life and forgotten to show you how special you are to them.  Saying you are feeling insecure can remind them to tell you that they care.  Saying that you feel jealous can remind them to say or show that the two of you have something special they don't want to lose.",

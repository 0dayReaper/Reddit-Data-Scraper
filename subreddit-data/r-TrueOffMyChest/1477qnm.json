    "postText": "My GF is extremly paranoid to the point where she can\u2018t be left alone over night. This has led to me reducing time with friends and family by a lot. I usually just try to arrange my meetings with friends and family to days where she is away with someone else. \nNow I\u2018ve been asked to spend a night at a cabin with friends in two weeks time. A boys trip. When I told my GF she just got sad and said over and over how she doesn\u2018t want to be alone and so on. I try to convinve her that she\u2018s perfectly safe in our apartment even if I\u2018m not there. I\u2018ve also said I would just cancel it or rearange it to a time where she\u2018s gone as well just to avoid the conflict because I knew damn well this would happen. She says I shouldn\u2018t cancel plans because of her and that she has to deal with it herself. All true but how am I supposed to enjoy a night out with the boys if I know this will cause conflict for the next two weeks and that she\u2018ll be pissed the entire time I will be not at home, texting me stuff like \u201eI\u2018m scared\u201c etc. and basically guilt tripping me. \nShe\u2018s sleeping in the living room while i type this because she is pissed off. I knew this would fucking happen. But I can\u2018t keep not making plans because of her, I know that and she knows that. However arguing forever to the point where i don\u2018t even enjoy my night out anymore ain\u2018t fucking worth it.\n\nEdit: For those who suggested a trauma, there is nothing at least nothing I know of like a break in, kidnapping or anything of that sorts, and we\u2018ve been dating for some time now, known each other multiple years so that would\u2018ve definetly come up at some point. \nTherapy is something I would be up for as I personally am seeing a therapist ever 1-2 months, however finding a therapist, espacially one for a certain disorder if you can call it that, is not that easy over here espacially one you can afford on lower-ish income. \n\nI\u2018m still planning to go on that trip and she also says she wants me to go. I still have a feeling how it\u2018s gonna go, once I\u2018m out tho.",

She should learn how to deal with this paranoia herself &amp; not be so codependent on you esp since it\u2019s taking a toll on OP. Go on the trip",

Thus making me curious about how much her paranoia is projected onto you. There are a few red flags I saw in this post.

I am aware of my issues and get help for myself from doctors and other outside sources in order to regain my independence and when my partner has plans to do something overnight we make sure I have everything I need before he leaves.\n\nYes it's incredibly stressful for me but I want him to be happy and be able to go out and do things I can't. He always takes loads of pictures and videos for me so I can feel like I was part of the experience seeing all the cool places he goes and the yummy food he gets to have. I would never stop those experiences for him just because I'm a couple of sandwiches short of a picnic.\n\nI focus on getting myself in a better position so we can enjoy these things together.\n\nI don't know what your partner is paranoid about but I can't imagine anything that would justify you not being able to go and have some downtime without being punished for it. If she doesn't want to help herself then that's her business but don't enable it that's not love or care that's just trying to have an easy life for the short term but you'll both have it much worse off in the longterm",

She has to be able to sleep alone sometimes. But you can do things to make it easier. Get one of those door bars that uses tension to keep the door closed if someone opens it from the outside. Those are great. And get a camera to face the front door, one that you can look at on your phone.

In turn he was probably happier with them because as our relationship progressed the less often he saw them and we all know it\u2019s a blast when you see a friend you haven\u2019t seen in awhile. just by the fact that you said she will be pissed off at you for leaving/ guilt tripping you while gone shows to me at least that this is DEFINITELY more of a jealously thing. \n\nWhat can you do to help this? honestly what helped most for me was breaking up. i know that\u2019s harsh but you can not continue to live a life where you\u2019re isolated from friends and guilt tripped whenever you do see them, how is that fair to you??? i\u2019m not saying you have to breakup forever but she needs to grow the fuck up and experience life on her own.",

If I\u2019m a good girlfriend karma will be served to my man for any wrongdoing and the universe will make me aware.

Also though, you not doing these outings is also kinda enabling the behavior. Both of you need to put in the work for this to work out or nothing is going to change. She\u2019s going to have to push herself and her fear / you need to do things on you\u2019re own away from her. It\u2019s a toughy, because you guys both obviously care about each other.

    "postText": "I'm 27 years old, I'm unable to talk to anybody about my deepest issues. I've been studying psychology for 5 years to figure out how to be happy, and I feel like it's doing just the opposite to me. I feel like my ambition has taken me far away from what is healthy for me. Since I wasn't able to become a therapist in my homecountry, I moved to the Netherlands. \n\nI've now been working hard the past 5 years to learn the language and how to be a good psychologist. I'm now at the last months of my master and looking for internships, but it is so difficult. The competition is so high it might even take a year for a native speaker to find a spot. And the language is horrible, even though I speak it very well by now, I don't even want to speak it. I'm far away from my family, who I feel I should've taken time to resolve some issues with, instead of running away to another country. I've also lost touch with my homecountry and all of my friends there. \n\nI don't have time to hangout with my friends here either because I'm so busy writing my thesis or working as a research assistant, or just being flatout depressed and laying paralyzed on the couch for hours. I've woken up every night after only 4-5 hours of sleep since february, with a burning sensation in my chest. I'm so stressed and feel so out of place in my life right now. I don't know what to do. \n\nIn my first two years here I still had my girlfriend from my homecountry, we tried long distance for a while. She was the greatest love I've ever had. We broke up when covid broke out, it was too difficult already when we could visit each other, so without that it was just too much. I immediately went into another relationship with someone with borderline, and it was so intense. She threatened to cut herself all the time. My old gf wanted to get back with me but it hurt her when she heard I was with someone else and since then she was never the same to me. \n\nI've felt so lost since I didnt have her anymore. Six months later I broke up with the borderline girl and went into a deep depression. I had to find a new place to live because my contract ran out, I luckily found a place, but my roommates where both so unhealthy, partying or gaming all the time. They both woke up the time I came home from work around 16. One smoked three fat joints per day. And the other was a complete narcissist, and none of them ever cleaned up after them. It was so horrible. \n\n\nI finally found my own apartment, and I started studying my master. I found some great new friends, but sadly they all live in another city, so I barely see them. \nI was diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder and went to group schema therapy for 60 weeks. It helped, but it was also draining, and I feel they could've helped me more. \n\nI feel isolated from everyone, and like I don't belong anywhere, that I'm chosing all the wrong paths, that I'll never be happy. \nI'm suffering so much and I feel like it's all my own fault. It's my fault that I chose to come here, my fault I went into psychology, and my fault that I'm so arrogant to think I can practice therapy in another language and become a therapist at all. Who am I to help others when I can't even take care of myself? What an idiot I am, and what path I've picked for myself.",

You didn't choose bad paths, you just need to give yourself a break and things to look forwards to. You can't pour from an empty cup.\n\nYour experiences may help you be a very effective therapist. Therapy is mainly a straightforward process. Getting a certification to practice, that's hard, but you are on your way to that.\n\nBest wishes.",

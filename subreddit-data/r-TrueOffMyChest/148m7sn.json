            "comment": "That's just how it goes. Everyone has flaws. Even the flawless find flaws to be insecure about. That's just human nature. So you have something different about your chest. So what? Everybody you meet has flaws too. You're not unique in that regard. Is what it is, bud. If it's something you can't change and plastic surgery can't fix then you just have to accept it. If plastic surgery *can* fix it, then at least you have a goal to strive for and maybe someday you can have it repaired. But honestly, if someone mistreats you about it or makes fun of you or rejects you over it, they're a shitty person to begin with and you are better off without them anyway.",

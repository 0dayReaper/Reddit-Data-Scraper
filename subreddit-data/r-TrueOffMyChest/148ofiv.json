    "postText": "My gf (f21) is from Argentina, but is living in Barcelona, Spain since 2-3 years ago, where I live (I'm m24). We met more than 1 year ago and we've been a couple 10 month already.\n\nShe doesn't have much here, and she's working at a supermarket, which she doesn't really like, but she doesn't have studies or a career, since she came here when she was 19yo. I'm from Spain and I have my job and career here, and basically all my life here (friends, family..well, only my father, mother and sister).\n\nThis month her parents came from argentina on holidays, to stay a month here, and they have been telling her to go live there. Today, she told me. I couldn't say much because I was shocked and she understood, she said she doesn't wanna leave if its not with me, but I know for a fact this could be a good opportunity for her to study (there the university is free, and in spain university is reallyreally expensive, so she can't afford it, but I really want her to do the thing the want and study and have her professional career.\n\nWe were looking for a flat or house to move here in Barcelona, since we want to live together and here I have my job and I'm stable (but here the rent is expensive so that's why we haven't find anything 'appropiate' yet). I didn't really expect this but I know she would be better living in her country.\n\nHer parents have 2 houses in argentina and they said they can 'give' us one to live us to and then she can study and I can continue working there (I work on logistics / transport / International trade so there is work anywhere for what I do).\n\nI know I have to still think about this, but I don't know what to do..\n\nI know this could be a good opportunity for her to do the things she wants, but maybe also for me to continue my career, but I think the quality of living in Argentina is not so good.\n\nJust to mention I live with my parents now but as I told I'm looking for a place to move here in my city, and she lives with her sister, the bf of her sister, the 2 children of her sister, and 2 cousins of her.\n\nAnd don't really know what to do, I just know that I love her and she loves me but I don't know if I'm ready for this big big step.",

Possibly could be the best thing he could do in terms of life experience, leaving the nest and fending for himself. Finding a new job and throwing himself into the fun of moving country with someone you love. If it doesn\u2019t work out, he can always return home to the nest. Just my 2 cents \ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "if you don't know if you're ready, chances are you are not. no one is ever ready for what life brings them, but some people are usually more courageous and take risks more easily then deal with consequences later. if you feel secure and stable where you are right now, stay there. i hope i am not being too harsh, but your relationship isn't that old, and you also are aware that this would help her own personal life a lot if she went back. i would sit her down and tell her your honest thoughts, and that you can both do long distance or you can even visit her sometime in the future, but not outright move there with her. she should understand your situation. you're also much older than her and i am not saying it's creepy or anything, but you have a bigger responsibility to advise her about her life since you're more experienced and you're far ahead than she is, so don't be afraid to give her your honest thoughts and encouragement to work on herself, without treating her like a kid ofc. long distance works, though of course if you're both very physical beings it may be difficult, but even if you two don't work out, you'll live with your conscience free knowing you didn't stop someone's future that could've turned out much better. please think about this. there's another comment here saying you only live once and blabla, and it's true you can always move back, but having a stable job and income should not be taken for granted even if you have a profession where you can get a job anywhere. i would not go and i would encourage her to go for the sake of her life. unless this is the woman you can see yourself marrying, i would not tie her down.",

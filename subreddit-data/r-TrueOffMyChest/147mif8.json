You're basically prevent me from accessing the great resource.\n\nThe cause aligns with my philosophy. However, I am uneffected by reddit's TOS for the time being, and unwilling to participate in the blackout. Making communities private is forcefully pushing me to use reddit less. This is an abuse of moderation privillages.\n\nFuck you blackout.",

    "postText": "I'll break up with my boyfriend of 2 years and kill myself afterwards. I'll do it exactly a month from now on. I want to keep the effect on him minimal but i do not know how.\n\nI have made my choice and I won't change my mind. I just wanted to tell someone, even if they don't hear it. I wanted to tell the truth one last time. I will miss our kitty and him, love them both oh so dearly. Goodbye.",

I had the same relationship case for 2 years she left and its not been a day to think me hurting myself.(dont even know what would i do if she did ended all) But in the end we do need to LIVE as we have only this life and if it may not look like much now it will later, kids family and much more. You will be wanting to live only longer and more. I wish I was the better person to tell you these. Dont break hearts, try to heal them.",

If you truly do love him, then you should get some help. I know that sounds insurmountable but even just talking to your boyfriend is a massive first step.",

    "postText": "I went to school with this girl. We became friends around 3 years before graduating and were really close. \n\nShe's very open about everything in her life. At first, I appreciated it. I felt like I was helping her out with her problems. However, problems started arising.\n\nFirst of all, she never cared to ask about me. She didn't ask how my day was, how things generally were going in my life. When I tried telling her about it, she'd cut me off and make it about herself. I stopped telling her things. However, I remember a specific event in our last year of school. I was deep in depression and felt horrible, didn't even take care of myself propperly. She'd make mean comments about my bad hygiene. One day my teacher pulled us out of class to discuss grades. When it was her turn he apperently asked if I was doing okay because I looked awful. She said \"yea, op is only sad because she can't sit next to me.\" Then she came back into the room and repeated her joke in front of the whole class.\n\nThen she would always call me about her problems, all the time. Like literally call and spam my phone until I picked up, no matter what. And when I picked up a few minutes late, she would get passive agressive about it.\n\nAlso she never really took my advice. Her partners would cheat on her and be generally assholes, she'd come cry to me, ask for advice and then she would run back to them and make up. It happened again and again, almost every week. She always told me about it and called me in tears for hours. And I felt horrible. I couldn't help her because she wouldn't accept it. But she kept asking and asking for more advice.\n\nEven at our graduation she came to my home and pulled the same thing again. Because my graduation day sure as hell isn't about me but her boyfriend.\n\nFinally, she'd go on to tell her partners that I was mean because, obviously, I wouldn't like them anymore after what they did to her. She said to just ignore me because I was always so resentful.\n\nAnyway, since going to university we haven't talked much. She was supposed to help me move, didn't show. Last time we talked she finally asked me how I was doing. I answered. She ghosted me. \n\nI'm so drained. I feel so exhausted just thinking about this.\n\nShe invited me to her birthday party. First I didn't reply to the group chat  but she stared texting and calling me on my phone. I told her I couldn't make it. She seemed very upset about it.\n\nI kind of feel selfish about this whole thing. Through all of it she was still nice to me and we do have fun memories. I feel like I'm being a bad person but at the same time I'm just so tired.",

Take some time out to focus on yourself and what you want as it seems like you\u2019ve done plenty of taking care of others :).\n\nYeah exactly and the responsibility of breaking her out of that cycle of bad habits and behaviours shouldn\u2019t have to fall on you, you\u2019ve tried to help her and you\u2019ve supported her through thick and thin but she won\u2019t change until she herself acknowledges that something in her life needs to change.\n\nI hope you\u2019re enjoying university - use it as an opportunity to make a fresh start and be the best you you can be because you sound awesome \ud83d\ude0a.",

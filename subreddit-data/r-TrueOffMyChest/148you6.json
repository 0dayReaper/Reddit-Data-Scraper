My distraction was day dreaming about being anyone else and it did make time go by faster. \n\nI had such a miserable and fucked up upbringing that I'd day dream constantly about being anyone else who seemed to have a normal life. Tbh I wished I could care about those silly social norms and rules because it would mean that'd be my biggest concern and my actual concerns were miles worse than those. \n\nIdk I'd watch kids in 5th grade get dropped off by their parents, their parents saying I love you and all the usual parent thing and the kid would act annoyed and I'd just be wishing I had what they had. \n\nUses to watch alot of those youtube vlog videos. \n\nAnd then at some point, almost overnight realized I couldn't keep doing that crap. The feeling sorry for myself and had to work towards the life I wanted so I did. Life has gotten so much better since then, I just wish I had come to the realization earlier.",

    "postText": "Little trigger warning: I will talk about my habit of chewing off my nails, if you are easily triggered by that, better skip the post!\n\nSo for context, I always chew my nails because of overthinking, nervousness or just sometimes out of relfex and don\u2019t notice it at all until my nails are really shorten down. \nI once got my nails done together with my sister with tips and at first it was a little weird but then I got used to it and just chewed on the hard plastic or not really at all. I am very young and still in school, so I refer to make my nails rather short because I also play the guitar since 3rd grade and am always used to play the guitar with my short nails and I just don\u2019t like it when my nails are exaggeratedly long.\nI had my fake nails for a little over four weeks until I started to chew them down until they would fall off and even though my nails were a little soft because of the nail glue, they grew really long and were healthier than before when I would chew them. \nSince it\u2019s pride month, I want to have a little more colour on my nails and have kind of hidden rainbow patterns on my next nails and when I told my sisters about doing my nails in the next few weeks, my dad became kind of upset, saying I don\u2019t need these, it\u2019s just a waste of money etc. etc. and that I can paint my nails by myself.\nI can\u2019t, I tried it numerous times before and always ended up painting them for 2-3 hours because they were either very messy or the color would smuch off because I wouldn\u2019t wait long enough for them to let them dry.\nI told my father that the nails I would have help me not to chew my nails and make my hands look more elegant.\nWhen he heard that, he was like \u201cChewing them? You don\u2019t chew them, I\u2019ve never seen you chew them before\u201d \n(Even though he literally saw me the day before chewing off my nails almost to the flesh due to the fact that I had a meltdown because of school stress etc.)\nI even asked my mom what she thinks about that and she said as long as they are appropriate for school and for my age she doesn\u2019t care and would prefer that I don\u2018t bite my nails off. Even when my mom said that, my dad scoffed and said again \u201cShe doesn\u2019t bite her nails!\u201d \nI chew my nails since early childhood and my dad would even sometimes ask why I bite my nails, but it\u2019s just a habit, so I never was able to really answer it. \n\nI just wanted to vent, if y\u2019all maybe have advice about how I could talk to my dad about it, that would be nice, I just needed a little space to talk about it, thanks for listening/ reading &lt;3",

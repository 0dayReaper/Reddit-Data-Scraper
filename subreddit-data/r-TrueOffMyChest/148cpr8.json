    "postText": "My fwb guy(been one year, so it's almost similar to a relationship) is into photography. He's going to do a project for his portfolio. He told me that I look pretty and if I would model for him, some months back. Now when he's about to do it, he posted about it and wrote if anyone was interested in being the model to dm him. He asked me if I knew any models and I shared some with him. He finalized the shoot with my friend and it's going to happen. I totally understand that it's for his profession and that he needs someone pretty and fit unlike me. But it makes me feel ugly because all I do is wake up, eat, cry scroll endlessly and sleep. Recently I've gained some weight due to stress so I'm a bit overweight now. I keep comparing myself with others, there's no way to stop. Whenever I see someone who's pretty, I feel ugly and like dying because neither do I have the brains nor the beauty.\nHow do I stop feeling like this?\nThe friend and him, both have asked me to accompany my friend, but I'll just feel shitty going there because it's not me her. I don't have any I'll feelings for my friend or him. I just feel bad for myself. How do I stop feeling like this?",

I used to model as a teenager, the girls there who some of them literally walk down the pasarela in Paris fashion week all said the same things. \u201c I feel fat, I feel unwanted, I feel ugly\u201d. We are all made to feel bad about our appearance, it\u2019s the beauty industries top marketing tool.\n\nI bet you are beautiful and I would love for you to feel beautiful again. I recommend for you to do your make up and make your hair pretty just for the fun of it, then post it on one of the subs here. I think the make up sub is pretty good, is full of encouragement and happiness. Best of luck \u2764\ufe0f",

I don't really want to waste their money on validating myself.  \nAlso, my mum still sees me as a kid and doesn't let me buy any beauty products, but she does have lots of stuff she bought for herself. I'm allowed to use her lipstick.",

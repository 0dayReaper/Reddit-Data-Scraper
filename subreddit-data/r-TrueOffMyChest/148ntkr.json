    "postText": "To start off this happened almost 3 years ago but still haunts me to this day. I\u2019m rarely in my home town due to my job but was home on a short break, enjoying my time at my state\u2019s fair where I met her.\n\nMy (now old) best friend introduced me to his cousin and the second I laid eyes on her I fell for her, she was everything I wanted. She was the most beautiful girl I\u2019ve ever seen, her smile shined over everything, she had an amazing body and was always ready to go on an adventure. I was out of relationships for about 3 years at this point and wasn\u2019t really looking to get into one, but this girl stole my heart faster than any girl ever has. \n\nWe spent as much time together as we could and after about a month I asked her to be my girlfriend and she said yes. I was the happiest I\u2019ve ever been, but unfortunately I have to go back to work separating us by a 17 hour long car drive and several states. We made it work as much as we could including FaceTiming and even me taking time off work to go home and see her. Everything seemed perfect at the time, until one day my heart and brain knew something was wrong.\n\nI kept asking mutual friends and some of my old friends if I was just panicking and everyone said I was just over thinking, but I knew something was wrong. I asked one of my friends to just check around and see if he could figure anything out but that was no use. After panicking for about a month and constantly asking her if everything was okay, she sent me the dreaded text I feared for. \n\n\u201cI cheated on you.\u201d \n\nI broke down. My work flow vanished, my happiness turned to depression, my social life disappeared, nobody recognized who I was anymore. I completely changed how I looked with tattoos and piercings and I\u2019m ashamed to say I struggled with self harm. \n\nAfter struggling for 5 months and my job gave a shock of temporarily moving me half way across the world. I decided that was my point of recovery, I ate healthy every single day I worked out constantly I slept 8 hours a night I was in the best shape of my life. I then had to return back to my original place of work. \n\nI decided it was finally time for me to go back to my home town after over a year of being away and show my family how I improved and everyone was so proud and happy. Then I saw her again while out to eat and I crashed all over again. I decided one of the best things for me would be going to a psych ward for little bit but it didn\u2019t help.\n\nI thought that I could talk to her to maybe get some closure but she just played games with my heart and put me back down. I\u2019ve gone back to the psych ward 2 more time and have improved slightly meeting multiple new people that help me see the brighter side of life again. \n\nI just recently completely stopped talking to her and I\u2019m starting to become the person I want to be, but I can\u2019t even look any where close to another relationship because of how deathly terrified I am of getting hurt again and having to go completely back through everything. I\u2019m talking to Theropist\u2019s and I\u2019m now I\u2019m depression and anxiety medication, but every now and then she pops back into my mind and completely shuts me down. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m never going to be able to get past this and start a family one day. I just feel stuck and can\u2019t trust dating anymore.",

I still struggle with codependency to this day. It's not an easy thing to get over, and I wish I had some profound nugget of wisdom to help you in your situation.\n\nThe only person who can alter the role you've set for yourself in this life is you. Help from people can be useful and is sometimes necessary for change or growth, but you've got to make and stick to the decisions that will make those changes a reality.\n\nYou have the power. You're much stronger than you give yourself credit for. You just need to stop giving all your power to this girl who doesn't seem to reciprocate your feelings. As clich\u00e9d and annoying as it sounds, there really are SOOOOOO many damn fish in the sea. You may feel like you already caught the fish and hung up your fishing pole, but whether it's your fault or not, the fish got away, so there's more anglin to be done. Go out and try new things, meet new people, and realize that not everything has to be forever.",

Must be able to sit through 45 mins of nonsense questions about how you agree, disagree, slightly agree, slightly disagree, oh and don\u2019t forget extremely agree. Like what in the fuck is the difference between agree and extremely agree? I extremely agree you can kiss my ass.\n\n\nApplying for any school program? Yes we would like 3 letters of recommendation from professors you don\u2019t talk to anymore, 90th percentile on this test, a 5 page essay on why you want to apply, and 2 Nobel peace prizes. \n\nI\u2019m going back to bed.",

Unfortunately it's not a cut and dry answer, even in the smallest of cases.\n\nAs much as we like to view them as faceless entities, companies and schools are run by and made up of regular people. Regular people who have the same issues and pitfalls. \n\nAs an example I had a colleague who every year (5 years I worked with him) would have a mental break (stress, anxiety, depression) and be on leave for an indefinite period. These leaves would often be months long. The company wouldn't be able to fill the role for a number of reasons, one being they were trying to help him out. \n\nThe issue was way less about the impact on the company, but the impact on all the other employees. Every person and department associated with his work has to cover for him, often at a drop of a hat. Not only did everyone else have their own issues, but now their life became more difficult and stressful because they're covering for him. He was a really good guy too, so everyone wanted the best for him, but even the most understanding people eventually got frustrated.\n\nAt what point do you say sorry we don't want to deal with it? It's a tough thing to determine.",

My mom showed up with a high school diploma and worked in the office for the same company. Solidly middle class wages, nothing extravagant. We ate at home often but we absolutely, as a family of 4, went out to eat, had yearly vacations, a country house with a big yard, one new car, a pool, a pool table, a 4 wheeler, just a bunch of middle class shit that makes life a little bit more bearable because you have some toys. They did that on high school diplomas by showing up. I feel like it's insanely unfair that myself, and by extension the generation I was apart of, were told from 6 years old that the only way to not be a loser and to make something of yourself is to go to college and get a good job. So I went to college and myself, and by extension this generation, were told there's your trouble, you shouldn't have listened to your parents at 15, you should have known better and gone into a trade. Yeah no shit that's great advice but kids tend to listen to the guidance they get from literally every person in their life.",

What we\u2019re in now is late capitalism, where the greed and inequality of capital and power become so overwhelming that it destroys the middle class. \n\nWe don\u2019t have to fully abolish capitalism (although I don\u2019t think it works for most people) but checks and balances need to be put in place. Essentially more \u201csocialist\u201d policies that keep money flowing, rather than allowing it to centralize in the hands of the few who got a head start by being born into wealth. Wealth taxes need to be imposed when the money starts stagnating in the bank accounts of the wealthy. Workers unions need to be formed to develop collective bargaining with capitalists so that workers get fair wages. \n\nWhat we really can\u2019t do is expect a leader to suddenly be able to bring back all of those jobs that were outsourced or automated away. It simply won\u2019t work, unless radical tariffs are placed on products manufactured in different countries. What we\u2019re seeing now is basically a race to the bottom where the product needs to be cheaper so that more people can buy it, but in the process people lose their jobs to cheaper manufacturing in other countries, so they can\u2019t afford to buy the products. Some capitalists would argue this is the efficiency of the market, but it\u2019s only efficient for them. America had it good, but squandered it. Unfortunately the way to recovery is viewed by many in America as \u201cevil socialism\u201d instead of having the awareness that taxing the wealthy and workers unions were normal when America was \u201cgreat\u201d.",

Once I got into my career around the age of 22, and being mostly a shut in with not too many friends in college, I realized how lucky I'd been in my life up to this point. My career path started off almost by a fluke.\n\nI basically got a massive head start because my parents started a college fund when I was born. I went to a pretty typical university and majored in a specialized field (looking back, some regrets with that now, but I digress). So got into college and through college with zero debt. Finding a job had been difficult, but by pure chance I had an opportunity to grab an internship. Made some connections there, and it just so happened a job opened on the other side of the country that *two* of the people at my internship worked for. They both recommended me. And me, like an idiot, almost didn't apply because this same company had brushed me off a few months prior in a different division. I ended up applying a day before the opening closed, and they called me back the following day. Never, ever, assume anything, just apply. You have nothing to lose.\n\nSince then, it's been a bit turbulent, but the bottom line is I'm employed, making acceptable money for where I live, and more importantly, dumping a ton of money into retirement (like almost a quarter of my paycheck). No debt, car paid off, big pipeline into my retirement, a bunch of money in my savings account. The only thing I'd be looking to do now is either buy a house or condo.",

They both marketing having *set* schedules, so I very clearly gave them my class schedule and my other job's schedule. Told them I *have* to be scheduled outside of these times, and as long as I am I can ajust my sleep or, more often, my homework around them. \n\nEven with all that, they would schedule me conflicting with classes or my other job because people called out. \n\nEventually had to quit one because I kept getting written up for not going in to work on days that I told them I could never work 6 months prior upon getting hired.\n\nMy grandmother used to always tell me she raised her kids alone and worked 2 jobs and her bosses would always work with her. I was weak for not being able to do it, even though I put myself through college and slept maybe 12-16 hours a week. \n\nThe times have changed and people don't fucking acknowledge it. THEY should have to go through the process of applying with an early 20's person's resume and see how they get treated.",

If you have a level of freedom and quality of life, even if it\u2019s just your own room, bathroom and maybe shared kitchen in a clean, bright space, you\u2019re more likely to feel energized to help yourself.\n\nSo people who already struggle with careers are at a further disadvantage because of the living environment that the handicap put them in and that keeps the cycle going.",

Someone had made a mistake somewhere, but no biggie, I'll just reschedule. They tell me it's their policy to have to wait a year once you've canceled/had a no-show because in their \"industry\", people with mental health problems frequently reschedule or miss their appointments so it gives the patient more incentive to actually come in. Well that's messed up, but I'm actually following the specific directions given to me by the hospital. Nope. Still had to wait a year. They said \"but you definitely won't miss your next appointment then huh!\"",

Some of the group programming you can get into in as little as 6 weeks. We have next to nothing for 1 on 1 care that is covered. Also it's all short term care. There is nothing for long term chronic care, you just have to keep cycling through the same short term programs over and over again.\n\nI've been on a DBT waitlist for about 2 years now. I was told the waitlist was about 2 years long, but then covid happened and now none of our programs are running. I don't expect to get into that program for like another 2 years at this point.\n\n2 years ago I was also refered to a program that I had been asking for, for nearly 10 years. This was for case management that was supposed to help me become a productive member of society again, right now I'm just a drain on the system. I called consistently for 3 months (mind you I have a phobia of making phone calls), and I never got a return call.\n\nWith covid, most of our mental health programming has been shut down because it worked on a group therapy system. Some programming has switched to 1 on 1 virtual care, but we don't have the system to handle everyone that way. We had massive backlogs before the pandemic, I can only imagine how much the waitlist are growing, especially with all the new added cases of covid anxiety and depression.",

Let me tell you, there are very few things as bad as those two together. I won't get into what happened but because of like 2 months of constant bullshit, I went from doing really well with handling my depression to almost commiting suicide. I figured at that point, my mental health was the most important thing, and I went to a staff to address it. The moment I finished explaining I was feeling suicidal, they shipped me to the nearest hospital, pushed me through a fuck ton of paper work and questions, and all so a doctor could say \"yep, he's depressed, suicidal, and needs help\". \n\nI have to pay the medical bill from that visit and the mandated therapy. Not the people who forced me to go and didn't give me a choice, me. An unemployed depressed teenager whose been part of a low income household my entire life. A teenager who has to fend for himself because the relationships back home were so fucking awful. Several thousand in debt with no job, no reliable connections, no certificate, and no options other than to hope things outside my control get better.\n\nYou know what those bills have done for my stress, fucking neutralized any possible help the therapy could do. I'm several thousands in debt at 19 for fucking nothing. I'm still enrolled, and I'm hoping to get my OSHA and license soon, but all I can fucking do is wait. Wait and hope that our healthcare economy crashes and these bills go away. Hope that JobCorps decides spend 80 bucks so I can do my 30 hour osha. Hope that JobCorps finds a way to let me get behind a wheel and practice. \n\nI'm fucking tired of hoping. I'm tired of waiting. I just want to know progress is being made and do something instead of sitting around.\n\nSorry for ranting but I'm just so done with everything this year has shoved down my throat.",

Had an interview and then nothing. Fuck guess I'm not even good enough to put Fido in a t-shirt.\n\nThe last place I went for an interview, I as essentially harassed. The guy asked me to bring my resume. One min into the interview, he gets out his own copy of my resume (the one from the site where I applied), studies them both and says he doesn't really hire people with no previous experience. Um cool then pay me for the gas I wasted driving here because you don't have 10 seconds in your day to scan through a resume. He then keeps going on and on how people lie on their resumes as if he's waiting for me to confess how I must have lied on my resume. Finally he asks me for a contact at my last place of work. I literally gave him the name of my direct boss. He says \"Yeah, I'm not going to call him because he's your buddy and he'll just tell me what I want to hear\"  . . . . what the actual fuck??

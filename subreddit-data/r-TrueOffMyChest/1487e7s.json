    "postText": "I found out recently my gf of 9 months sent nudes photos a couple weeks into dating. I fucking loved this girl with everything I had to give her. When I started dating her she had issues with medication and drugs which cause her to be very impulsive and unaware of herself and surroundings. I helped her get off everything and she has gotten alot better and more mature as a person. I just found out a couple weeks into me dating her she sent some nude pictures and I don't know how to feel. It's broken alot of trust for me but I still love her and the fact that happened when she was on drugs is what's fucking with me. Idk whether I just need to let it go as it was before she got better or if I should let her go in general and move on. I can't get over all the great things we do together now and what's been going for us. I haven't slept and haven't eaten. This is killing me",

If she fights you on it \u201cit\u2019s an invasion of her privacy\u201d let her go. It\u2019ll hurt but it\u2019s for the best",

So I've had access to everything for 7 months now and I happened to find a saved nude in her snapchat from back when we started dating. She said she's willing to do anything including blocking any contact I wish. I just don't wanna be a control freak telling her who she can and can't talk to. She mentioned that that was the only one and that if she was genuinely trying to cheat and hide things that photo would've been long gone. So she definitely wasn't actively hiding things",

And did she confess to this because she wanted to address it for a healthy relationship, or did you find out another way?\n\nAlso I don\u2019t know if you realize it, but in your post you wrote you \u201cloved\u201d her. Past tense, not present. I think your subconscious knows what\u2019s up.",

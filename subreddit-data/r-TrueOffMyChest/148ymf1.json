    "postText": "Back in December of 2018, I (18f at the time, I'm 23 now and currently medically transitioning to male) started dating a (17m at the time, 21 or 22 now). We were together from 12/22/18 until 05/06/20. \nAlot happened while him and I were together. When I was 19 and him 18, he got me pregnant. He also never wore protection no matter how many times I asked him to and he never not once pulled out, I would ask why he didn't and he would literally say \"I want to cum inside it feels amazing\".. I wasn't on birth control, yet I would still always have sex with him. He would also always tell me that it was my responsibility to get on birth control. But this pregnancy story is a whole other thing..\n\n  Anyway.. he would always ask me to do anal. I would say no while he would pout and beg and say things like \"Come ooonnnn..\", \"I thought you loved me\", \"you love me don't you?\", all while literally trying to put his dick in my ass as he was saying that while I argued with him and trying to push myself away with my legs. He always got it in and when that would happen I just stopped and went along with it, acting like I liked it.. and I did like it sometimes.. I actually use to really like doing anal.. I feel so gross. But it got to the point where anytime we would have sex he'd just want to do anal, and I would beg him to just have normal sex and not anal. He would give the excuse that I was on my period and he didn't want to get blood on him. But we had done that before and he was okay with it. But anyway I'd end up saying no and would have to say that my stomach was upset and I didn't want an accident (I have IBS), and I few times when I would say that he would lock me in his bathroom (there was a lock on the outside for some reason and so was the light switch). When I would be locked on there he gave me one of those things that is used to help make constipation go away. And he wouldn't let me out until I did that and had a bowel movement. And once I got out I would say fine to him and we'd do it. He would have me say lewd things during that type of sex. I really thought I liked him being like that at the time but in the back of my head I felt like something was wrong. I felt like if I told anyone about what he was doing that they'd tell me to break up with him. I loved him and I thought he loved and cared about me. But then the first quarantine because of covid happened. And him and I didn't see each other for about two months. I still texted him every day with little responses from him because he was on his PS4. \n\n  And I figured out that I would get seemingly interested replies from him when I would text him dirty things and send him nudes, but alot of the time he would just say \"oh\", \"oh okay\", \"okay\". And I would text him about sexual things we had done and how much I liked it just to get him to talk to me. But like I said before.. I think I *did* like it.. idk.. but it still always made me mad because I would tell him no every time. But anyway.. I was trying to get a job in my town at the time too.. and one of the places I was trying for I ended up becoming friends with the cashier (19m at the time, 21 now). We started texting nearly every day (he actually texted me more than my now ex [then boyfriend] at the time) and he became my best friend. I noticed that I started getting very strong feelings for him because just how kind and friendly he was, I'd even go down to his store and visit him for hours while he worked. I remember I started thinking to myself \"Why is he nicer to me than my own boyfriend?\" Well, one night he was a little bit drunk while we were texting and he admitted that he had feelings for me (he knew I had a boyfriend).. I admitted my feelings right away to him too. We literally talked it out over the next few weeks, we never flirted, but we actually talked it out. Eventually he told me that he loved me.. I told him that I loved him too. I started telling him stuff about my boyfriend at the time and how he was to me. He was shocked and disgusted, angry. \n\n  We talked more a decided to hang out at the park in my town one day. We didn't verbally talk about all of that and stuff, but we ended up kissing and making out multiple times. Then we both had to go home later after that. When I got home I texted him that I've never done that before and I told him that I had to tell my (then boyfriend). He told me I should too. So I texted my bf at the time and told him to call me and that I needed to tell him something. He called me and just went \"what\" like he was annoyed. I told him that me and a friend of mine kissed. He understandably got pissed and hung up on me. Then he texted me calling me names and telling me I needed to go to that guy I kissed and punch him in the nuts or he would come there and kill him (the thing is, he had actually cheated on me twice before, I only knew about one of them cuz he lied about the second time.. he actually fucked them). \n\n  The next day my bf (now my ex) showed up at my house and talked my mom and aunt I to letting me come to his house for two weeks. I ended up going. I still texted my friend whom I'd kissed (my ex didn't know) almost every day about how I felt like shit and how pissed everyone was at me. But within those two weeks he go me high and drunk most nights saying that it would make me feel better and he would do anal on me or put his hands down my pants (sometimes in front of people) when I would ask him to stop. He never listened. But eventually I had had enough and told his mom about how he would always make me do anal. He woke him up and confronted him about it. Told him that it was rape. She asked him, and her exact words were \"Did she ever tell you no to anal and you'd do it anyway?\" He said \"uh.. yeah?\". She told him that just because I was his girlfriend doesn't mean that he gets to do whatever even if I say no. After that talk I went on a walk. \n\n  Before I left he yelled at me saying \"it's uncool that you told my mom\" and I said \"well it's uncool what you've been doing\". My friend (also his ex) and her bf came and got me and I talked to them about it. They told me I should break up with him ASAP. So when they took me back that's what I did. He cried and was angry. A few days later I ended up getting in a relationship with the guy I kissed (my ex didn't know yet). And that's when he started texting me and my friends, threatening to kill himself and make me watch unless I got back with him, sent my nudes to my friend, and was making horrible posts about me on Facebook. His mom also started saying that I'm lying and that all that happened was \"I freaked out cus he put his finger in my ass\". I eventually blocked him and her..and it stopped kinda of. But over the first nearly two years he's found ways to text me just saying \"hi bitch\" and stuff. And I hadn't thought about him and everything that happened until about a week ago and now it's getting to me so fucking badly. I feel so disgusting. Did he rape me..? Did he not rape me and I've been lying to myself this whole time..?? I don't know why it's bothering me so much again... But idk.. I am so confused again. I *let* him do it.\n\n\u2022Also the guy I had kissed and got feelings for, we've been together over three years now and are actually engaged. He is nothing like my ex and is genuinely the most kind person I've ever met in my life, and I couldn't be happier with him. But he doesn't know this stuff is bothering me again.\n\nEdit: a lot of the comments are saying I need to talk to a therapist about it. I have so many times over the years, and my fianc\u00e9 knows all about it and everything. He just doesn't know how much it's bothering me again. And I have in fact gone to the police about it, showed them texts where he admitted it and even video proof, they weren't interested in seeing any of it.",

It was a horrible situation you were in and I know it is part of human nature to let the mind linger on past experiences, both good and bad, but I think the best thing to do would be to move on the best way you can and let the past be the past and be used as a reminder to not let yourself be in that position again, though with your current guy it sounds like it wouldn't be a problem.",

His mother seems like a large part of the problem as she doesn't seem like she did anything but antagonize the situation.  Though is this situation what led to the transitioning? I just thought that was a significant detail that you included but didn't build on. I'm just asking and understand if you didn't want to talk about it.",

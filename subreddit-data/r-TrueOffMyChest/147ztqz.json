    "postText": "Happy Pride Month!  I found a decent-sized rainbow flag at a thrift store last year and bought it because, hey $0.99 pride flag.  Well since it's now Pride Month, and I'm on the Pride Committee for my remote job, I hung it up on the sliding glass door to my balcony.  I have my desk set up right by the door so that I can see outside while I work.  The back of my building faces the back of another building in my apartment complex so all of our balconies and patios face each other. \n\nDirectly across from me is a woman who lives with her 4-year-old daughter, and we've chatted from our balconies occasionally since she moved in a couple of months ago.  I know that she works in healthcare, she's a single mom, and her dad and teenage cousin come to visit fairly frequently.  Her little girl absolutely loves my dog and likes to go out on the balcony to wave at him and talk to him when she sees him out on mine.\n\nWell the morning I put my flag up, I noticed the neighbor step outside as she often does.  She looked across to my balcony, saw the flag, and got a weird look on her face.  She immediately went back inside and closed her blinds back up.  A little while later my dog was outside on the balcony and her little girl came out on the balcony to wave at him, but after a minute my neighbor came outside to bring her daughter back in and closed the door.  Now her blinds are always closed and whenever she opens her door for fresh air I just see a hand reach around the blinds to slide the door open or closed.  I haven't seen her or her daughter hang out on the balcony since.\n\nCoincidence?  Maybe.  Homophobia?  Quite possibly.  Joke's on her, though.  I'm not even gay. \ud83e\udd23",

    "postText": "I\u2019m 16 years old and I have been diagnosed with autism ever since I was 11. I am biologically a female so it\u2019s been hard. I don\u2019t have any friends because I can\u2019t read social situations and when someone speaks to me I talk about my special interests without realising they wanting to speak about something else. I can only have one major thing a day and if there is two or more I become burnt out and distant. I\u2019m treated by a 9 year old by my family (aside from my mom) and it hurts. I want to get into trouble just so I can have that teenage life but I\u2019m to scared and get so burnt out so easily. I know wanting to do stuff to get me in trouble is bad but I just want that teenage life. I don\u2019t get along with children my age which is completely my fault because I say out of context stuff and I don\u2019t expect anyone to deal with that. Of course if you are also autistic please don\u2019t feel like you have to feel this way; this is my own experience.",

If you can find even 1 other person that shares a common interest you can try to use that to start to build up a relationship with someone. (Take it slow, it can be easy to lose yourself and get caught up talking about something your interested in.) \n\nI would recommend doing some basic studying of body language. Rather then trying to understand and learn every social situation, look up some videos of basic body language and this can help you start to understand social ques a little better. \n\nI know it's not fair that you have to work harder to get some of those human connections we all crave but it is worth putting in some work and training like you would do to get better at any skill. \n\n-From someone who cares, and wishes the best for you.",

It is not a skill that comes naturally to us autistics, but if you can learn to redirect the attention to the other person every so often, it can help them feel more comfortable.\n\nAnd make sure you focus on them.  It can be hard, especially when they are talking ssoo sssslllloooowwww that you just want to finish what they\u2019re saying for them so you can move forward, but letting them complete their thoughts and then responding directly to their thoughts is a great way to make sure they feel welcomed by you.\n\nAnd don\u2019t be ashamed of saying \u201chey, I gotta go, I have to take care of some stuff elsewhere\u201d when you\u2019re feeling edgy or burned out. It is much better to remove yourself before you melt down, and it\u2019s not even a lie; the \u201cstuff\u201d you have to take care of is your mental health.\n\nOne last thing: because we have to consciously learn these skills, it can be harder to acquire them, but we can also achieve a level of proficiency with them that goes beyond what others have. It\u2019s like being gifted but never learning how to study, when you get to a spot where you struggle you are left behind. While your peers who struggled and learned how to properly study have no difficulty in later learning environments.  With practice, you can stretch the boundaries of what you are comfortable with and actually come to enjoy spending time listening to others.",

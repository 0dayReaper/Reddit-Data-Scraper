    "postText": "How I Met Your Mother is my go to show. I watch it once or twice every year, I watch it when I'm depressed, it's my comfort show. I love Seinfeld, and I watch it with parents or if I'm eating.\n\nContent matters. Two broke girls or two and a half men or big bang aren't really my taste (they have decent moments, but not my cup of tea). I'm always down to watch Disney shit like Zach and Cody, Raven, Wizards of Waverly place. Or Nick: anything Dan Schneider or Big Time Rush. It's nice. \n\nI feel comfort. I feel less alone. To me, saying laugh tracks are a que to laugh is like saying watching a movie with friends is a que for how to feel at certain parts. It just doesn't make sense, the two don't correlate. \n\nThe most effect it has is when something depressing happens. For instance (HIMYM SPOILER) &gt;!when Marshall's dad dies!&lt; the absence of laughter let's the sad moments hit *that* much harder.\n\nI love them, if people blanket statement \"laugh track bad haha\" I think you're stupid and have no idea why they still get made. It's for comfort as much as it is for content. (Kinda like ASMR weirdos but there's a story, not just someone being gross/creepy into a mic to calm people down.)",

            "comment": "This sentiment comes from an earlier era, before studio sitcoms were shot with live audiences.  M*A*S*H for instance was shot without an audience, but they literally played a \"laugh track\" over the top to signpost the \"laugh now\" moments.  It was horrible.\n\nThese days it's less common, and a live audience is more common, but people think of studio laughter as a \"laugh track\".  In fairness I'm sure the shitter sitcoms augment somewhat.  I mean X Got Talent absolutely augments audience reactions (awfully).",

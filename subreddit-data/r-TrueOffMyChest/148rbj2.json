    "postText": "I need to get this off my chest as its been eating me alive for the past few weeks. (also i am very aware that what i did was really bad). Im 17F and my Bf 16M dave pulled a prank on his ex best friend john. 16M. So for context me and john met in my sophomore year his freshman year.(john is also very well know for manipulating girls and is very proud of it.)At first he was really nice and we got along. I was going through a very abusive relationship at the time which made me very depressed. well during the summer as the school year ended so did my abusive relationship. i was still very much depressed and very much so emotionally destroyed. john knew this and used the fact  i was very vulnerable to try and get with me. after i told him no. he stopped talking to me. over the course of this school hes asked me out confessed his \"love\" for me many times. everytime i tell him i just want to be friends and i have apologized many times that i made him feel bad. later dave tells me how he would talk shit about me to everyone every time i told him i just wanted to be friends. when i got with dave his best friend he went as far as to threaten to fight him. after that things cooled down or at least i thought they did. when dave texted me we needed to talk. apparently john and another of his friend went to dave and told him that i was talking sh\\*t about him to the whole school (its a small school and im very well known) during a time that we we friends. dave had a messy break up ( i have already posted a story about that.) he said that i was a big reason people started to dislike him. we talked it out a lot and dave knew this wasnt true. that and i had people that he asked ( my close friends) if i had ever done this. so we decided to pull a prank on john to see just how far he be willing to go with his lies. The prank was that me and dave broke up over the fact that dave didnt believe that i hadnt done what john said i did. i came to lunch that day sad and on the verge of tears when dave found out what happened he immediately started comforting me. telling me that it wasnt my fault and that he doesnt know who told dave thoses things and that he knew they were untrue. well after me getting frustrated and crying harder he finally says \" i didnt think he would react like this.\" all of this while dave is asking him over and over if he was sure about me talking bad about him. well after that me and dave were pretended to get back together when i told john he told me it was a mistake and was very upset that i wont move on. well dave asked if we could fake break up again as he kept telling me how jonh was only trying to get with me. this is now in the summer i didnt think that was true i didnt want to think that someone i thought of as a friend would do that. i was very sadly wrong. after i agree i tell dave that i will one NOT GET WITH JOHN under no circumstances. i would also not lead him on and i still saw him as a friend. well hes tried to get with me several times now. and has even gone as far as to blame himself to blaming john to now blaming me for the break up. hes the only one not in on the prank everyone knows. even his younger bother knows. well someone told him about it and he told me to \"get out of his life\" and blocked me. im still so hurt that he was so ok with destroying my relationship with dave so that i could be with him. but then blames me for the whole break up. but in the end i feel really bad for pulling the prank. like i betrayed him and i did. idk i just feel like such a bad person.",

    "postText": "Tw: mention of suicide and severe depression. Not detailed but u never know \n\nHello again. I (24 F) am currently typing this while my boyfriend (26 M) is beside me. And we are watching Markiplier play \"fnaf sister location.\" Just earlier he told me he'd pay for my class this summer and I didn't have to pay him back. \n\nWe been together 4 years and it has been the best most amazing time of my life. He is the kindest human being ever met. He is so optimistic and kind hearted. Once we were out with his family and this old woman was struggling to walk to her car. So he got up and rushed over to help her. I followed and watched this man just help these strangers out of the goodness of his heart. \n\nWhen we first met, he bought me lemonade and we shared fries. He stuck by me even after my friends show him the gay yaoi drawings in my sketch book (they wanted to test him. Trust me it was out love if u knew them \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23). He even stuck by me when I had random waves of depression, anxiety and felt extremely low. I even opened about my suicidal thoughts and he just listened and comforted me. He told me he was there as long as I needed. \n\nHe respects my boundaries. When I say I don't like his family taking pictures of me. Even candid. He tells them. When I don't wanna go to their events cuz of my social anxiety, he understands and never pushes. He spoils me. And I try to spoil him. \n\nHe goes above and beyond and it scares me. Truthfully because I don't believe I deserve this amazing human being with such a big heart. But whenever ri tell him this and sometimes cry. He holds me and tells me that doesn't matter. Because he loves me and he knows I love him and that's enough.\n\nHe is currently playing the new Zelda game, mocking/mimicking markiplier freaking out. And being so adorable I could smother him in cuddles and kisses. Which imma do right after I post this. \n\nI just wanted to scream that I love this man. I just had to say something because honestly, I can't really contain how much he means to me. And my friends r sick and tired of me still adoring this man. And yes, they love him too. My cousin and I went out recently and she kept saying not to leave him, he's a great choice and if I leave him our family will be pissed. \n\nAnd she isn't wrong \n\nAnyway, thanks for listening. Imma go disrupt my boyfriends game and smother him with affection before going back to tacos and markiplier.",

    "postText": "\nIm 19 years old, I just finished my first year at college and I failed miserably. I had no motivation and I tried to study but my subjects were just too much for me. Im probably going to receive an email soon that is going to state i\u2019m expelled. I dont know how to tell my parents or my friends and my boyfriend. I feel like I\u2019m all alone and I\u2019m starting to be desperate. I want to go to another university and start over but i\u2019m afraid i just wasted my own time and my parents money. I don\u2019t know what to do from now on\u2026.",

    "postText": "Basically title. I never told anyone about how I was molested and sexually assaulted by another kid my age for like 2 years in and off from 1st through 3rdish grade. I finally worked up the courage to tell my therapist, he was the first person I ever told. \n\nI had repressed these memories until one day I remembered them all in high school. And then it broke me and I have intimacy issues with my girlfriends that give me all kinds of hangups about sex.\n\nMy therapist said it was normal because \u201ckids do things like I\u2019ll show you mine if you show me yours\u201d and I tried explaining to him how it was NOT that and he just blew me off and acted like I didn\u2019t just tell him that. I get the feeling he thinks everything that happened to me was just OK because it was another kid my age who abused me and not an adult. \n\nI didn\u2019t go back to that therapist. I went to a new one, worked up the courage to tell him about it, he said it is definitely NOT normal and told me how it\u2019s the cause of my intimacy issues and anxiety and bad shame feelings about sex and recommend EMDR therapy.\n\nJust wanted to vent. I am still struggling with this trauma. I feel disgusting and shameful even though I was a victim. And it has caused all kinds of problems for me like depression and intimacy issues.",

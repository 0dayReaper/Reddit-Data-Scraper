    "postText": "It's my birthday today. A part of me wants to be excited about it. Another part of me feels nothing great is going to happen. I wish something amazing would happen but I don't want to be hopeful either. \nSo far, it doesn't seem like much will happen but it's early so...\nI feel like I'm spiralling and slightly want to cry. It's 5:15am over here.\nIt would be nice to receive some lovely gifts for once apart from food.\nI have no plans except to go to work.",

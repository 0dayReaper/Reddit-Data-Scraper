    "postText": "I\u2019ve smoked weed everyday for most of my life. I\u2019ve always believed it to be a safer alternative to drinking alcohol. People say it all the time; nobody has died from smoking too much weed, you can\u2019t get addicted to marijuana. I truly believed these things. But I WAS addicted and I almost didn\u2019t make it to my 30th birthday today because of it. \n\nThe fact that I needed to smoke everyday just to feel normal is testament enough. I wasn\u2019t smoking to get high anymore, I was smoking just to start my day. I felt like I couldn\u2019t function without it. I couldn\u2019t function at all and I\u2019m only realizing this now. I wasted 15 years of my life being stoned and depressed on the couch. I had no desire to do anything that made me happy, I had no desire to do anything at all. Because of weed, I settled for mediocrity every day for 15 years. So much of my life, wasted. \n\nThen I got really sick - vomiting and nausea for two weeks. I lost 20 pounds in that time. The doctors told me to stop smoking and I didn\u2019t listen. It can\u2019t be the weed, I thought. It\u2019s harmless. I choked it up to a bad bottle of wine. \n\nA couple months later, it happened again. This time, vomiting for 5 days. Again, I thought it was just a bad hangover and went to the doctor in hopes of getting an IV to restore my fluids. The doctor had one feel of my chest and I was rushed to the ER with Subcutaneous emphysema as a result of cannabis hyperemesis syndrome. Essentially,I had so much thc built up in my tissues from years of use, it was starting to seep into my digestive tract and it was making me sick. The extreme vomiting that resulted caused me to tear my esophagus which meant air was getting into my chest cavity. The doctor said that my X-rays showed so much air in my chest, that another day or two of vomiting could have resulted in my heart exploding. On my nephew\u2019s first birthday, a week before my 30th. To think of what I could have done to my friends and family breaks my heart. \n\nCHS seems to affect some heavy smokers and not others. Doctors don\u2019t seem to know why, but what my doctor did tell me is I was incredibly lucky to have stopped vomiting when I did. He also told me that nowadays, with weed being legal and THC concentrations being so high, MOST of the cases of nausea and vomiting that come into the ER is related to marijuana use. \n\nWeed is NOT a harmless plant. It\u2019s still a drug, and like any drug there are consequences to its use. We need to be more honest about what these dangers are, both physically and mentally, especially with young people. I almost destroyed so many lives because of my habit. I could have ruined my nephews birthday for everyone, forever. I\u2019ve already wasted so many of my best years being stoned. \n\nI\u2019m quitting cold turkey. I\u2019m not touching the stuff again. I\u2019m just sorry it took this long. I\u2019m celebrating my 30th birthday today SOBER and I\u2019ve never been more excited about life.  \n\nIf you\u2019ve been thinking about quitting, take this as a sign. Don\u2019t let yourself waste away like I did.\n\nEDIT: Jesus fucking Christ. I came here as an addict to admit I have a problem with weed. The problem is MINE and yet so many of you think you can tell me what I\u2019ve been through. I don\u2019t care if you love weed or if it helped you, it didn\u2019t help me. It was ruining my life. I\u2019m glad I got rid of it and I\u2019m happy to share my story. Call me lazy, call me a liar, say I\u2019m looking for attention, It doesn\u2019t matter. I feel better today because I cut weed out of my life. I have no intention of going back. I\u2019m not saying the drug is evil, but what I am saying is we should be HONEST with ourselves and recognize that like any other drug, weed affects everyone differently and people HAVE and WILL CONTINUE To get sick from it. To say otherwise is crazy. CHS is real, people have died. It\u2019s interesting how many people are experts when it comes to marijuana. Listening to a joe Rogan podcast doesn\u2019t make you an expert. If you\u2019re happy being a stoner, be a fucking stoner. In these comments there are enough stories to prove it\u2019s not the miracle drug so many of you are defending it to be. If you\u2019re trying to quit, please DM me. I\u2019ll cheer you on.",

One of the nurses said, \"oh, he's awake,\" and then a mask was thrust onto my face and I next remember waking up in my hospital room. Quite startling. \n\nBut every surgery I've had since I started smoking I've been asked to not smoke for 24 hours before the surgery. 48h if I could go that long would be better. But I did the 24h. Every surgery went without a hitch with the anesthesia side. Though when I had my cracked molar and a couple wisdom teeth pulled, I was \"knocked out\" though I assume it's more the type of drug that leaves you conscious but not able to remember what happens. Apparently while I was in roofied state I tried vehemently to get away from whatever pain I was feeling, and they had to literally hold me down. So hard was my struggle that a perfect imprint of a hand was left bruised into my thigh.",

I\u2019m happy I could get over myself and give help a chance. 12 years of alcoholism bc I couldn\u2019t find peace about my brothers death. We are all susceptible to so many things. We\u2019re fragile. Life is hard and we don\u2019t innately know how to overcome all struggles and stresses. They lead to different coping mechanisms, when we find a release to those stresses, beyond resolving them, the dopamine reward system kicks in. The reward becomes avoiding the truth or facing it. Once faced we either solve it or perpetually run. I\u2019m good at running from one thing but things tend to pile up, they come from different directions and then all the sudden you are trapped and now it\u2019s suffocating and there\u2019s not another step you can take. I\u2019m just so happy to be alive. If I see something that I feel odd about I take a moment and say the only \u201cprayer\u201d I\u2019m comfortable with. The serenity prayer. I\u2019m not religious but damn that shit sets me straight. I gotta accept things I cannot change. I gotta have courage to change the things I can!!!! The hardest is getting the wisdom to know the difference between the things I can change and cannot. Every damn day I try and be in service of others be compassionate and try to help when it\u2019s possible to make a positive outcome. I try and never have do something I\u2019ll have to say sorry about. I\u2019m not proofreading this shit bc just did it stream of consciousness.",

People studied withdrawing from a tolerance of weed experienced agitation, sleeplessness, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.\nThere are studies outlining it's effected with continuous use (4 or more  days a week) effecting IQ in children younger then 23, impairment of short term memory, increased risk of paranoia, and increased risk of psychosis. \nAll of this is not to say that weed is evil, alcohol in the body is far more damaging, especially in addition, but this is my understanding of the topic of weed addiction as a pharmacy student.",

They spread propaganda like the shit was worse than crack, like you'd come home and murder your parents and eat their brains, some real bath salts type shit.\n\nSo yeah, people figured out you could smoke casually and it be basically safer than alcohol which no one really cared too much about except in alcoholism cases. Yeah, weed is pretty fucking safe compared to other drugs, and alcohol. Yeah, you will very very likely be fine if you smoke once on the weekends every so often.\n\nThat doesn't mean sitting there staying high all day, breathing actual fucking smoke, isn't going to have consequences. You're still getting high. It should be a fucking luxury.\n\nThis is coming from someone who's bipolar and can't smoke or I'll get horrible anxiety attacks and likely get paranoid and shit for a day or two. I can absolutely say the shit isn't good for me and has a real effect on my brain, worse than some other drugs. I can't touch psychedelics like weed, shrooms, acid, not anymore at least. I see other people do fine, and I believe it can be pretty healthy if you don't abuse it like crazy, but it definitely does something to you that I doubt is fucking healthy, if only just breathing smoke. Thing is, we only live once, so do what you want, but recognize the risk when you decide to stay not sober for a year or longer.",

Adam Cox is alive and well.\nAlso note, my only argument here is that it was unfair of the original comment to claim the only thing he regretted about the situation is that he lost his job, which simply wasnt true.",

I\u2019ve had people with a family history of severe mental illness ask if trying weed would be okay, and I always always *always* tell them no, that it\u2019s taking a huge risk with their mental health. I also know a number of people who have gone to therapy for depression/anxiety/related conditions, and their therapist immediately told them they can and will not treat them until they\u2019ve stopped smoking pot, because it can be impossible to tell what is the drug, and what is the psychological condition. \n\nWeed is a drug. Less harmful than some, than most, really, but it\u2019s still a substance that should be approached cautiously and with *full* understanding of the associated risks.",

Not to mention, drinking too much water can lead to a shitload of other health problems other than just dieing because you drank too much water.\n\nEverything should be moderated to some degree, and smoking every day like that is bad. Not only are you inhaling plant matter (we have tobacco studies to prove why that's a bad thing), but like this person showed built up THC (which is fat soluable) can fuck you up. I wish OP the best of luck in the future, just keep off the daily smoking lmao (did that for a bit, my waistline hasn't been the same since)",

I've even seen someone who literally had a permanent IV port placed for fluids and IV nausea meds because they're absolutely unwilling to stop smoking pot. It's like clockwork: every time they go back to smoking pot they end up in the ER within 24 hours. \n\nYes, it has potential benefits. No, you're not a bad person for using pot.

I know you probably hate getting asked medical questions off the clock but I\u2019ll give it a shot anyway.

Though from what I\u2019ve seen it looks like heavy users mostly. And, skinnier/underweight people seem more at risk. My guess is that due to them having less fat to absorb the THC and thus it\u2019s seeping into their system faster.\n\nHow much if any research has been done on this? Are you aware of any scholarly work/papers addressing it. I\u2019d love to read some of you could point me in the right direction.\n\nAlso, would it go away or lessen over time as THC content in your body goes down? Or is it irreversible once caught\u2026acquired\u2026developed?",

I\u2019ve had alcoholics actively withdrawing tell me how much they drink.  I\u2019ve had hardcore fentanyl users tell me how much they shoot up/snort.  Trying to get a straight answer from a cyclic vomiting patient?  Good luck.\n\n\nThat said, I personally think CHS occurs because you have cannaboid receptors in your gut and at some point after long-term use (months/years), you just sensitize some of these receptors and cause vomiting.  And at that point, any additional weed is just going to eventually cause vomiting.  You have to quit weed.",

When people say cannibis is not addictive, they should specify that it isn't chemically addictive. For example opiates and nicotine use pathways that down regulate the body's production of endogenous agents that use the same pathways (like morphine and acetocholine, respectively). Which gives you withdrawal symptoms when you stop ingesting the drug. From my understanding, cannabinoids are produced in the body but they aren't downregulate or anything because you can have as much as possible and it doesn't kill you. So it does give dopamine just like anything can, but then the habit is more what's addictive that the direct drug. Please correct me if I'm wrong.",

Each time for at least less then a month, longest was three but then the witcher 3 came out and I caved to going back to it. I\u2019ve never met someone who loves it more than me.

I\u2019m paralyzed by that fact. I never worried about it being harmful. I\u2019m hoping your story can help push me to stop. Can I ask what did you normally smoke out of? I 90% of the time smoke out of a small pipe you could pick up for 20$ at a smokeshop. I never clean them I just replace them every 4 to 5 months.",

Weed is the most peaceful life ruiner ive ever encountered. It makes doing absolutely nothing okay. It makes living a life absent of accomplishment, excitement, and memorable experiences just fine. Eventually you'll look back and ask, \"wtf did I do these last 3, 5, or 10 years?\" If you smoke weed every day(that includes if you smoke it only at night ie after work), i want you to think about what you look forward to in everyday life. OP is spot on and knows what the fuck they are talking about. Fuck weed. If you smoke weed every day, try breaking up with it. Try writing a letter to weed like its an ex you just broke up with. The details of that letter will tell you if you have a problem(do you miss it? Do you resent it? Are you better off without it?). Good luck",

But it can also be incredibly harmful, especially when it becomes routine.\n\nI used to self-medicate my depression with weed, and at first it helped a *lot*. But then I got to the same point that you did (habit-wise, not medically), where I literally wouldn't feel normal if I didn't smoke. It was the first thing I did every morning. When I couldn't wake-and-bake because of work or school, I'd be irritable and spend the whole day just looking forward to getting stoned later. I had no appetite when I wasn't some level of stoned. I either couldn't fall asleep or couldn't stay asleep if I didn't have THC actively in my system. I knew people who smoked even more than I did because they literally couldn't function without it; they literally couldn't eat, sleep, watch TV, hang out with friends, play video games, or hold a conversation without being stoned. They were addicted. They couldn't even take tolerance breaks because they couldn't eat or sleep without the aid of weed.\n\nI knew people who had straight-up mental breakdowns solely due to weed. Myself included. \n\nNot even to mention that exclusively smoking weed can still very much lead to things like cancer, significantly decreased immune and respiratory system responses (you have a *much* higher risk of getting sick if you're a heavy weed smoker), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, respiratory infection, increased paranoia/anxiety, dissociation/derealization, worsened depression, psychosis, bouts of mania, and hallucinations, just to name a few.\n\nLike, I'm not tryna shame anyone for enjoying weed, and I don't think you were (or did) either. But to insist that it's totally harmless and has absolutely no negative effects on the body or the mind, *ever*, is just straight-up ignorant and foolish.",

Personally when I was at my lowest I was smoking like above 50% THC several times a day and having horrible side effects whenever I was sober. I\u2019ve since stopped doing anything with THC content above 10% And I\u2019ve honestly seen such a drastic change in my approach to getting stoned. My impulses to smoke are 100% less frequent and less intense and I don\u2019t feel like trash the day after. I think it needs to be clear to younger stoners who are getting into smoking and stuff how much THC content affects the kind of high you\u2019re getting and That just because a strain has a very high THC doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s actually gonna be fun to smoke cause I think a lot of people of my generation just think high THC = better more intense high And completely disregard anything with Thc contents of below 20%. Right now I\u2019m smoking pretty often because it\u2019s summer and I\u2019ve gotten both doses so I\u2019m seeing a lot of old stoner friends I haven\u2019t seen in a while and I feel way more in control of my consumption on the lower thc stuff",

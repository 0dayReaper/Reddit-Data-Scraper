    "postText": "I\u2019ve been baking/decorating cakes since I was 17 years old and I just turned 20 three days ago. By now I was hoping to be able to decorate cakes better, but my handwriting isn\u2019t even that good. My cake decorating level is subpar at best. I worked as a cake decorator for only 6 months before quitting then at another place as a cake decorator for less than 3 about two weeks ago. I\u2019m currently in between jobs, but the issue is that when I was 17 I thought I\u2019d be in culinary school by now but I don\u2019t even have a quarter of the amount of money I\u2019d need and I\u2019m too stubborn to take out a loan. On top of that, I\u2019ve gained about 30 pounds in one year and I just can\u2019t get myself to stop eating snacks and just wallowing in self pity. Then I don\u2019t have money for therapy or any sort of insurance so I haven\u2019t even been to a doctor in about two years now. And then I owe about $2,000 in credit cards\u2026 I\u2019m just really disappointed in how bad I let my life get in such a short amount of time.",

            "comment": "You are only 20! You can totally turn this all around. First, you can teach yourself just about anything for free or relatively cheaply through the wonderful internet. YouTube University, as I like to call it. As far as the credit card, I know $2000 seems like a lot to you, but you can bring that down very fast. Just commit. If you want to learn more cooking or pastry skills, look for a job in a bakery or cafe. Be honest that you have basic skills, and your goal is to learn more! Employers love it when employees WANT to learn. As far as the weight gain, it might be a coping mechanism for depression. You may want to get a therapist to work on your feelings and anxiety or depression. Increase your activity level, Get outside and walk. It will not only raise your spirit, but it will help you burn some calories. Try fitness dance videos, wall pilates, etc. They are fun, and exercise raises endorphins and makes you happy.",

Also the issue with bakeries for me is when I was a cake decorator my last manager basically said I\u2019d never make it because I wasn\u2019t fast enough and all my coworkers said I wouldn\u2019t last long in this business. It really hurt my self esteem and makes me want to stop. Like I walked out of the job without a two week notice due to how much the stress was taking a toll on me",

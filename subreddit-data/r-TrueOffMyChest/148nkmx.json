    "postText": "I've been sharing her since she turned 18 yo, in 2020, im addicted to do it, im obsessed with her body, her smile and the way she treats me, she disrespects me so hard that makes me cry but then she hug me and i have to go to the closest toilet to unload all for her since my balls start hurting in milliseconds. I've sexualized her so much that my friendship with her feel broken and wrong. Im so confused rught now i dont know what to do, i try to avoid her but the more isolated i remain the worst i get sharing her online. Im a sick pervert, i should get punished.",

    "postText": "I am a part of the center for accessibility at my university because I have schizoaffective disorder and when I went to take my exam they would no joke read me each line of the instructions sheet and check if I understood or not. Like no I don't have a learning disability :/ \n\nAnother situation is that whenever I talk to someone in class and tell them I'm with the center for accessibility, they think I'm dumber than them or something and immediately act as if they know more than me. \n\nAnyways thank you for reading.",

People would often speak to me very loudly - because of course I must have hearing loss - and also speak very, very slowly to me, because I must be developmentally delayed in some way. It was bizarre. And they meant well, so good on them for trying.",

And I kid you not once teachers or other students find that out they always try to guide me when I don't ask them to( like take my hand and try to walk with me somewhere) . Or they talk slow like I'm deaf like.... what? For example I'm treated normally at first but if they find out then all of a sudden I'm very fragile to them. So I know how you feel.",

I know it's hard, don't get too frustrated! Math can be fun, I promise! Now what is 2 + 3? It's 5! Do you understand that, precious? :D\" Imagine that spoken very loudly in baby speak directed towards you right in front of your peers, then watching *them* also assume you must have cognitive issues for someone to talk to you like that, so several of them start talking to you like that too.\n\nIt's not accommodation, it's discrimination, and believe it or not, this kind of thing happens all the time in work places and colleges.",

However, having people who seemingly think they know what you need is a bad thing. Trying to guide you somewhere where you had no intention of going, yelling at you from across the hall or street because you made a turn they think you didn\u2019t mean to make, the list goes on.\nImagine being in a familiar place, not a very familiar one, but maybe one you haven\u2019t visited in a few months. You step out of your car or get off the bus and take a moment to get your bearings. Maybe you walk a couple steps in a certain direction or another, And all of a sudden, you have people yelling at you, trying to guide you or just trying to be helpful in any number of ways, but not one of them asking if you need help in the first place, or how they can help you.",

    "postText": "My boyfriend came over to my house for the first time yesterday. He had went out with his friends the day prior, and he bought me a stuffed animal. When he walked into my house he handed it to me and I could smell him on it. It wasn\u2019t an obnoxiously strong smell of cologne, but more you noticing it\u2019s there. I could also smell his cologne on him, but again not an obnoxious smell. We went into my room, but we didn\u2019t do anything like that yet, we\u2019ve only been dating a little over a month. And I just could not focus on what he was saying. Everytime he spoke I was fixated on his face, his expressions, his cute little laugh, the way you could see his dimples when he said certain words, the way words flowed out of his mouth. I cant wait for him to come over again. This isn\u2019t a honeymoon thing, at least I don\u2019t think so, i\u2019ve had a crush on him for almost a year and we\u2019ve been close during that time. I just like how my family was involved with him, or the way that our parents had a genuine conversation. The way I was just happy to be with him. I know we\u2019re still young but I genuinely can see myself having an actual future with him, not how you just think about it with other people, but like I can see how we would just go together, like he\u2019s my person. I genuinely love him so much.",

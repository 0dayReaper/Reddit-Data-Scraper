Ladies and Gentlemen we\u2019ve just lost the picture, but what we\u2019ve seen speaks for itself. The Corvair spacecraft has apparently been taken over, conquered, if you will, by a master race of giant space ants. It\u2019s difficult to tell from this vantage point whether they will consume the captive Earth man or merely enslave them. One thing is for certain; there is no stopping them, the ants will soon be here. And I for one welcome our new insect overlords. I\u2019d like to remind them that as a trusted TV personality, I can be helpful in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar caves",

The best bowler that ever came into the doors was someone who just came into play In The Groove (think DDR) day-in and day-out. One day the manager said he wasn't giving kids a chance to play, so if he wanted to keep coming in he had to play in a league.\n\nThe guy obliged, and got a 900 series twice in the same sanctioned league. With a ball and shoes both off the rack. I forgot what his series average was for the league, I think it was over 750. It was insane, and he eventually stopped coming in because people wouldn't leave him alone in the arcade... they'd just ask him to fill in vacant spots in leagues.\n\nThat said, the entire time I worked there I never saw a 7-10 split pickup in a league game. They're legitimately pretty rare, and only ever saw them picked up by the college teams that came in and specifically set up splits to practice on.",

Meanwhile, my Dad, (handicap 15) has 5 holes-in-one AND a 300 game. \n\nI can tell you that I was positively SHAKING on that 12th shot in the 300 game, and that's the thing, you must be nearly perfect, 12 times, over space of approximately 30-40 minutes time. \n\nWith a hole1, you can deflect your shot off a tree, skip it across a pond, get a lucky bounce, etc, etc from ONE SWING. \n\nAs for my unofficial hole1, I did that in practice, alone. To be official you must have witnesses and complete 18 holes. \n\n300 is harder.",

I guess it depends on what you mean by \"harder\".  \n\nA hole in one requires an extraordinary amount of luck and a decent baseline of skill.  You basically just need some aiming ability and enough control/power to get the ball near the pin and you have a chance.  You don't even need to be a good golfer to get a hole in one.\n\nBowling a 300 seems to be a lot more on the skill/instinct end of things with only a little bit of luck.  If your average is 100-150, I don't think you have a chance of suddenly breaking out and bowling a 300 game.  Maybe it's happened but that seems even less likely than a hole in one.",

A mediocre bowler basically has no chance at a perfect game, but highly skilled bowlers are good enough to bowl perfect games fairly regularly.\n\nSo is it harder to do a highly skilled task that is possible to master, or something more luck based that requires less skill, but is functionally impossible to master?",

A pro golfer that consistently lands close to the hole is way more likely to get a hole in one at some point vs me being lucky to hit the green at all. In the end its still probability though.",

Bowlers have to navigate different frictions, different feels, different surfaces, but the golfer's lane is 120+ meters long, his target is much smaller,, and he has to navigate things like weather, ponds between himself and the target, and a continually variable set of outcomes that are independent of his technique.",

The green and the cup were partially covered in shadow but you could still see the flag. The ball hit the green and ran right towards the flag but I lost it in the shadow. I knew there was a chance. But thought for sure it would have run off the other side of the green and I would\u2019ve found it there. I was alone and I lost my shit when I walked up the little hill to the green and the ball was in the hole! \n\nI was alone but I was imagining a crowd reaction like [this](https://youtu.be/EduujxPmRJA). \n\nHope you can close your eyes and imagine that it\u2019s for you too bud.

My only glory in sports was I rolled a 300 in bowing once. Got a trophy in the bowling league I was in. Took me 18 years to get that.",

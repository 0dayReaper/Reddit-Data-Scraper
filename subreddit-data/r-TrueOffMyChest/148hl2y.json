    "postText": "I (m25) come from a very emotional family where emotions and crying and other things that come along with it are very much accepted and even encouraged. Growing up I remember sitting with my family laughing till we cried, crying when we were sad and just being very open about our emotions, I loved it because I feel these emotions brought us closer together because of the openness we were all very close. One of The biggest things that I appreciated about myself is that I allowed myself to be emotional to help release pain an energy which left me in a good place afterwards. \n\nIn the past few years though I\u2019ve noticed little things where I\u2019m not able to cry I\u2019m not able to outwardly able to physically show my emotions   I can feel them to an extent and I feel like I want to cry but it\u2019s just nothing. It was simple things where if I saw a sad news story where I used to shed a tear I\u2019m now not reacting at all. \n\nI\u2019m at a point in life where I\u2019m thinking about this a lot because a lot of things are happening that\u2019s making people around me emotional. my grandmother is sick and is probably going to pass soon, a few other loved ones are not well and I\u2019m having zero response to any of it. At first I thought maybe I\u2019m just overwhelmed with emotion right now that it\u2019s just drowning me and reversing the effect but this truly has been going on for several years before any of these really emotional events. I\u2019m hurt that I\u2019m not able cry, I feel like a psycho not having any reaction to these events. I\u2019m just at a loss.",

            "comment": "One of my best friends committed suicide when we were younger (23 years ago - really worsening schizophrenia). My other friend called to tell me about it, and my first response was just 'Ok.', for someone I'd known for ten years. We were at the wake and his watch started beeping (time for meds). No one knew what to do so I just went and turned the alarm off. You know, just seemed like the thing to do at the time.\n\nOf course, the last time I talked to him he was thinking about it (getting worse, severely beaten his girlfriend, tried to strangle a friend in the bathroom a few minutes after he'd gone in because he thought he'd heard our friend say something - we wondered why he'd gone in and broke that up). So he was worried about hurting more people because he couldn't trust himself. I said if that's what you feel, then no one can really stop you.\n\nHe did, and that really messed me up long term. But internally, and no real outward reaction at the time.\n\nCognitive behavioral therapy was great; stopped it from being either overwhelming or absolutely absent feelings.\n\nI still love seeing people happy (even ones I don't know) and making people laugh. But again, that's all in my thoughts so the outward physical reaction seems forced. That switches sometimes to thinking 'I don't really need to know about your daughter's new stroller', and the fa\u00e7ade drops momentarily. It's like I'm just playing a character.\n\nMy wide tells me 'You always care about everyone else more than yourself!' as though it's some kind of insult. I respond 'That's my job. That's literally my job.'\n\nBPD may be something you want to discuss, but the very fact that you're worried tells me, and likely a lot of others, that you have far too much empathy to be a sociopath. So don't worry unless you can't lose a grudge or, on the flip side, think it's all your fault.\n\nP.S. - I have a 99 y/o grandmother who we just brought back home last week. She's eating again on her own, needs twice a day care, and still has perfect recall. I'll miss her when she's gone, but if my dad called today I wouldn't be surprised but would just be supportive that they're going through the same feelings I am, but processing them in a different fashion. (the epitome of 'fake it till you make it' ... sorry, but not really)\n\nYou're good.",

I\u2019ve been thinking about seeing a therapist for a while, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019ve been so resistant to it given that\u2019s about where my college degree is lol. But I\u2019m thankful I\u2019m not alone with this kind of mind.",

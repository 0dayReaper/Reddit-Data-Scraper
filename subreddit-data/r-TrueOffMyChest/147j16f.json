    "postText": "In 2015 the love of my life died. He was everything. He suffered from major depression but he understood me like noone ever had or has since. I'm English and he's American. His depression stemmed from growing up in a deeply religious family who shunned him after he left the church, he lost everything, his friends his family. Defining what we had is tricky. We loved each other we were intimate and it was always 'us', but at times I had to be less than that I had to be a friend, and at times I had to be more of a carer. I prevented his death perhaps 4 or 5 times knowlingly, I'm unsure how many times I did this unknowingly. I never resented him for this because he was wonderful. We were in each others lives for 12 years. He started to get his life back on track a few years before his death at 33 but I was aware that I was always a bit of a crutch for him, my presence always seemed, at the worst of times, to hold him in the same place and he needed to grow into himself. As such I decided to back away from our relationship for the sake of his growth. He knew this, we had discussed it. I wasn't leaving him just giving him breathing space, growing space. He had gotten a job, the first he'd had in 7 years, he was on medication, he had got a new apartment was making new friends and I backed away so he could focus on building his foundations. It was hard for me, but I thought it was important. I moved away and we kept in touch but the time zones made this trickier with each passing week but I fully intended to return to Seattle. In late June 2015 I got a message from him, we hadn't spoken for a couple months but I'd kept tabs on him, he was doing well. Looking back these messages were a goodbye but I didn't notice it because I wasn't IN it anymore, my mind wasn't constantly on high alert for the signs that I would have seen before. I messaged a few times after that, phoned him too, but received no response. I hoped for the best and rationalised that he was building those foundations. Then Christmas comes around and I get an email from his brother in law who attached a document. This document was a suicide letter. \n\nHis relationship with his family (and extended family) was strained as they were still a part of the religion, I was surprised that anyone even informed me he had died. They didn't tell me how, or when, but for all this time I have assumed he was responsible for his death. \n\nIn grief, and complete denial, I deleted the email. I regret this. It was the last tangible thing I had of him. He wrote an entire page and most of it was a mix of mild anger, tiredness, instructions, and sarcastic humour. But the paragraph relating to me was\u2026different. My paragraph I've commited to memory but I wish I still had it physically:\n\n\"(My name), if she asks, which she won't, tell her I went to Paris. She can't know what I did, she was the only golden thing in this world and I would like to keep her that way.\"\n\nI still cry that he's gone, even after 8 years. I cry for everything that I know, everything that I don't, and everything I will never know. I only found out yesterday that he died July 12th 2015 after 8 years of believing it was in December. I had noone to ask, I had noone to confirm anything with. Not knowing the details about his death feels like falling into a void and I get deeper into that void everytime I think about how little I know. I found out on one of those ancestory websites after years of trying to obtain a death certificate and failing because I don't have the authority to get one. So as of yesterday I now know where he died (or at least I know the county, and from that I can deduce the specific place), but the 'how'....I'll probably never know. \n\nMy friends know I was in a relationship with him for all that time, they know that it ended. I've allowed them to assume it was the long distance that ended it. But that's it. I've never spoke about this to anyone. I'm in a wonderful relationship now but I've hidden all of this from them, I often wish things were different because he'll forever be my \"what if\" in all the possible ways.\n\nWhat if he was alive?\nWhat if I saw that message for what it was?\nWhat if I never left?",

Suicide leaves so many unknowns and it's hard to process it when you're left behind with these unanswered questions. I lost my son this way in 2016 and not a day goes by that I don't think about all things I could've or should've done differently. But I also know in my heart I did everything possible as his mom to help him and just have to accept that it was his time to go.",

That I was always one step away from permanent failure. One slip up of overlooking something. But Jesus Christ, the guilt I carry around every day is overwhelming. I question everything, like did I know it was a goodbye? Did I just ignore that? I keep thinking about the last 11 words of your post - just have to accept that it was his time to go...for some reason this gives me momentary relief in a way. I'm so angry still as well though, at me and him, and I feel awful for that. There is never any closure is there? Closure isn't anything you get. Thank you again.",

Truthfully you never get over this type of loss, you just have to work through it in whatever ways you can. Having unanswered questions and feeling as if you're somehow to blame for things (even when logically you know you're not) just makes things really muddy inside your head. And the anger! Yucky! Just when you think you've worked your way through it, it rears its ugly head again. \n\nThe best advice I've got for you is to just allow the grief process to happen. Don't blame yourself for the emotions you ever feel because you have to have them if ever you're going to make peace with this situation. And try your very hardest to take the blame for this situation off your shoulders and place it where it belongs. This is a really harsh reality that I'm going to speak right now but he chose to end his life. I fully understand that his brain was not right and that in his defense he was not having rational thoughts, however, the choice was and will have always been his. This concept was incredibly hard for me to accept about my son. Like so so so hard. I had so much anger at the world and at God and at myself and my ex-husband. But after years of therapy I had to realize that none of us made my son do this. I have probably never cried so hard in my life as when that realization hit me. I was never ever angry at my son though. Not even once. I just realized I had to let my other anger go so that my heart could start healing.",

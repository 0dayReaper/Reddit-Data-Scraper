    "postText": "i work at a bar, and i\u2019m a manager in the kitchen. last night i ended up going to the ER because of chest pain/tightness, lightheaded, and not being able to breathe. they took an EKG, did a chest x-ray, and didn\u2019t find anything. they asked what i did today and i told them i was at work and that my boss was upset with me and wouldn\u2019t stop (metaphorically) hitting me while i was down, until i started standing up for myself. he did this in front of another manager, and then it ended up getting slammed due to the Nuggets-Heat game. i told the doctors, and my family about what my boss said to me and how he treated me, and they all told me it sounds like a need to find a different job that won\u2019t send me to the ER. any advice?",

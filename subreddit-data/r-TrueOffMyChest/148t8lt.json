    "postText": "I'm 37 with long COVID and quit my previous job because of the daily fatigue. I could probably do like 30 hours max a week and have a little energy to take care of myself and have a life outside of work. \n\nI'm currently unemployed but haven't been paid in a month, waiting to see if I get SNAP. I don't know if I'll fully recover from long COVID. Maybe I can get disability. \n\nThe problem is that I can't do my previous careers as they are physical work, require 8-10 hour shifts, or I can't do them because of new sensory issues, and I can't do that. I tried with reasonable accommodations before without luck. I can barely exercise or concentrate for long periods.\n\nI don't know what I want to do for work, I've rarely enjoyed working before this, and put up with it to pay bills. It feels like a waste of time to apply and work a job I'm only there to get paid. I've had major depression for years and been suicidal at times and now that I have a chronic illness I can't give a Fuck for bullshit anymore. I've probably lost several years of life expectancy because of this disease. \n\nI don't mind working if it makes the world better, or is a meaningful job. I have no social life and other issues, been going to therapy but it's not helping. I'm losing hope in humanity after Trump and the pandemic, so I need a job where I won't hate myself or people. I need a living wage job so I can move away from my mother and afford an apartment by myself. To have hope in the future. \n\nMy biggest problem is that none of my long term plans have ever worked out and I am tired of delayed gratification things because I'm 37 and it's never paid off. Not love, not therapy, not careers, not hobbies. Each I've given long periods to do the work and delay gratification. Life continues to get worse. \n\nI'm sick of life, and so badly want to have hope my life could be different but I don't.",

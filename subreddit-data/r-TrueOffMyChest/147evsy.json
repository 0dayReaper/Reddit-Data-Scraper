    "postText": "Yeah today I (22F) found out my now ex-boyfriend (20M) has been cheating on me all along. This is a very new relationship, but I think that he has been cheating on me ever since the start. What\u2019s worse is that, this is not just a cheat, I would consider it a scam. Throughout the relationship, I have been having anxieties and doubts about different stuff. But whenever I ask him about these, he would get defensive and say that it is me who is overthinking. He would also reassure me that he will never cheat on me. However, now that I have found out that this is the case, I would consider my anxieties quite rational. After I confronted him, he just completely flipped out and accused me of all sorts of things. Saying that I am too ugly/boring/insecure etc. to be with him, and saying that he never intended to be serious with me. But just yesterday he said that he is very serious about this relationship. And he has repeatedly told me that he thinks that I am very pretty. (I don\u2019t know whether he is lying, but realistically speaking I am perhaps a solid 7.5 if not higher, and he himself is not more than 8.5) I am in such a state of shock right now. While I am not sorry about losing a relationship with such a dirtbag, I do feel a little shaken by the fact that someone could say how they appreciate you one day and then act like you are a stalker or the most disgusting thing on earth the other day. Despite that I am pretty sure that he is saying those things just to hurt me, my self-esteem is undoubtedly hurt. My relationships so far have all been quite unsuccessful too, and sometimes I think there\u2019s something wrong with me.",

    "postText": "so during my first year of middle school, I went to New York. and to be completely honest it was the best time I ever had. it was so much fun going around and visiting landmarks and stuff. and I miss it a lot. and this vacation is so much more memorable than all the other trips. I miss new york so much more than all of the other places.  even though I was only there for a week I feel this feeling of homesickness or something where I want to go back but cant cus Im still a student. and that kinda hurts. by kinda hurts I mean I cry myself to sleep. and the big thing is like I said I don't know why. maybe it was cus I was being bullied back then or something but I miss it so much. and I've been there before but back then I never felt this kind of feeling. and i cant seem to get rid of it. it comes back like every 2 weeks or so. this has been going on for a while now.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsorry for this shitty writing. just wanted to get it off my chest.",

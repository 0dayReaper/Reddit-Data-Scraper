    "postText": "My dad calls the years he played hockey the best years of his life. He suffered an injury and had to stop and I think he\u2019s never been able to let it go. He\u2019s an angry man. I love him and he\u2019s not a bad person, but he\u2019s very angry.\n\nI\u2019m a girl, and the youngest so he never forced hockey on me. But my older brother never had a choice. Thankfully, my brother loved hockey. That is until an older team member did something to him and my brother cannot play anymore. He freaks out at the thought of it.\n\nDad was understanding at first. He raised hell trying to get the pos arrested (nothing happened though because of various reasons) and he comforted my brother. He was a different person. \n\nBut it\u2019s been over a year and dad\u2019s dropping hints about my brother playing hockey again. He\u2019s getting angry as well. It hasn\u2019t exploded yet, but dad\u2019s impatient. He thinks my brother should be over it by now. Dad mentioned the other day that he couldn\u2019t wait to see my brother play again, and my brother left to his room. I went to check on him because no one else would and he was crying. \n\nWhy is hockey so important to my dad? What is so great about the game that he\u2019s losing his mind over it? I had hope that he\u2019d change after what happened but he\u2019s still the same. He\u2019s yelling at my mom over everything again and he\u2019s back to essentially ignoring my existence. Why couldn\u2019t we have had a normal dad. \n\nI wish he never got injured. My dad getting injured led to him meeting my mom and us existing, but I would gladly take never being born. It doesn\u2019t make sense. He\u2019s almost 50. Why is he still so miserable about something that happened over 20 years ago. Sometimes when he goes on rants about how the injury ruined his life, I feel like he really means my brother and I ruined his life. Idk if this is cringe but why aren\u2019t we enough for him? Why can\u2019t he just let it go????? \n\nMaybe I\u2019m overreacting and I don\u2019t get the hype around any sport but I\u2019m just\u2026 idek the word. No one listens to me, mom\u2019s busy trying to keep my brother sane and my dad calm so I think she forgets I exist too. Idek how I feel anymore. I\u2019m just rambling now but I just really wish I had a different dad. This is embarrassing but I sometimes wish that my best friend\u2019s dad could be my dad as well. I just feel so pathetic and useless and miserable. I really do love him, but I don\u2019t want him to be my dad.",

            "comment": "Your dad needs help, he's hung up on it because he thinks his life would've turned out so much better had he not had his injury and been able to play, that he would've had a better life. He wants to live out his fantasy through your brother. You all need therapy and help from the trauma your father has caused. You deserve to be taken care of and hopefully you and your brother can focus on yourselves and being happy. I'd say try to see if when you and your brother turn 18 leave the house or mom get a divorce",

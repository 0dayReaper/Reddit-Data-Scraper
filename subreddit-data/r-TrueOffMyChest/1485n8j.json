    "postText": "So last week after I left my house I saw a dog without a collar on the side of the road. I stopped to check on him and called my husband to come pick up my dog who was riding in the car with me because I didn't want to put a strange dog in my car while my dog was already in it. Anyways while I'm waiting for my husband a woman comes out of her trailer and walks over and tells me this dog belongs to the house down the road, they just got him and he keeps getting off the chain. They've been keeping him chained up on their front porch with another older dog. I thanked the neighbor for the information and left with the dog. \n\nI was feeling a lot of guilt at first because I knew who he belonged to but I won't return him. I've driven by the house a few times and I see the other dog chained to the porch. Once it hits a hot enough temperature I'm going to call animal control to try to get the dog taken away but for now I'm just going to love my new baby.  I've got an appointment to get him checked with the vet and I'm going to have him fixed.",

If they see the dog they can also call the police or just take it. In the meantime please call your local animal shelter and report the dog on the chain. That might also help you if you are caught by establishing a pattern of criminal abuse against them. I've rescued lots of dogs but you do need to be careful of the legalities. Even a rescue dog can have enough monetary value after just a single vet visit or the price they paid as a puppy to a breeder to potentially put it in the felony range.",

The neighbor will almost certainly tell the owners if they notice the dog hasn\u2019t returned. Unfortunately, you may have no choice but to return the dog in that case- everyone who\u2019s saying microchip/keep the vet records is thinking you can use those things as proof of ownership, which may be true if the owner doesn\u2019t have similar documents, but that\u2019s not likely, especially since they recently got him and likely have adoption/purchase paperwork.

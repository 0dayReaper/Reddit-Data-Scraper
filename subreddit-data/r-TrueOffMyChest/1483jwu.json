    "postText": "Exactly as the title says. I\u2019ve never been in a relationship and it\u2019s been fucking with my head. I weigh 240 and I\u2019ve had multiple sexual partners. I\u2019ve specifically had this fwb (M35) for 3 years and I was taking some time to reflect on every guy I\u2019ve hooked up with. And when I thought about my fwb it just made me sad because 3 years is a long time to know someone, to hookup with someone, confine in someone and just get to know. It just made me think why wouldn\u2019t he date me. As I\u2019ve thought with every one I keep wondering \u201c am I too ugly to date? Do they not want to be seen with me?\u201d I just don\u2019t understand. I know I\u2019m a good person( I know when people say this they typically aren\u2019t good people) but I\u2019d literally give the shirt off my back to my friends and those I love. I have a big heart and it\u2019s just hard to stay positive about the future when I want to be a mom eventually. And then it makes me think like everyone wants to fuck a girl who\u2019s fat, but not date one. Idk if it\u2019s my self image, personality, or what, but people say that they are attracted to my personality and find it easy to talk to/ask for advice. Soo I just don\u2019t understand what\u2019s wrong with me. (Sorry this is a rant and just all over the place)",

The point is you do not have to feel any pressure to be in a relationship. We all grow and mature at our own pace, and whoever we end up dating is lucky to be a part of our lives. You are valid to want a relationship, and you should continue trying to date around, but the priority should be you. Work on you, who you wanna be, and you will meet people along this journey. Don't lose hope!",

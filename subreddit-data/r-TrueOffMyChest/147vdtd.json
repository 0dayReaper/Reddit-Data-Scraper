    "postText": "the past year and a half i\u2019ve spent mainly alone, i lost a lot of my friends during a bad time in my life where i wasn\u2019t the best person, and others because we brought out the worst in each other. since then, i\u2019ve been isolating from relationships i guess because of a sort of fear. my last friend was my best friend for 4 years before we moved in together, and it was one of the worst environments i\u2019ve lived in. some of it is my responsibility, i got into a deep depression for weeks and couldn\u2019t leave bed let alone help properly with household chores. on the other hand she would wake me up screaming, created rumours about me, and participated in my (now ex\u2019s) abuse. because of that i\u2019ve really been taking my time away from people. \n\ni\u2019ve really missed it though. i want to go to patios and have sleep overs and tell secrets. i want to be there to support and love friends. lately i\u2019ve been upset feeling like i\u2019m missing out because i\u2019m not even sure where or how to make friends. it feels like everyone has a bestie and i\u2019m so so happy for them! i just want to now how they did that lol \n\nso today i went to the beach. it\u2019s really hot here, and i thought i shouldn\u2019t have to miss out on life because i don\u2019t know how to invite people in mine. i\u2019ve really been working on taking care of my physical and mental health, even still my entire wardrobe is baggy/large shirts and pants. so wearing a bikini in public was kinda scary, but looking at pics i actually look cute and hot! i giggled when i looked back on the pics in my car (i didn\u2019t take many but was hard to see in the sun anyway lol)\n\ni set up further away from people and read my book, i even went into the water for a little bit! i only wish i brought bug spray because i didn\u2019t think about how many flies would be attracted to the fruit and cider i had. but i\u2019m surprised at how much fun i had even though it was just me! i even found some really\ncool rocks and cleaned up trash some people left behind! i missed the ocean but i didn\u2019t think i\u2019d enjoy it alone so much!\n\ni just wanted to share because i\u2019m really happy it was so nice :) i hope everyone has a lovely day!!",

Nothing wrong with enjoying a day at the beach by yourself, doing that with movies and lunch outdoors is very refreshing as well. Go have fun with that, and when you're ready maybe look for some new and better people to hang out with.",

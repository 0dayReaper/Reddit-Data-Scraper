    "postText": "I was training in a new job and two weeks in I was left alone to close up the shop. I had a man in a mask and sunglasses throw down a bag that contained an axe. He nearly hit me in the head with it when I didn\u2019t open the drawer quick enough. \n\nI won\u2019t go through too much more but since then my thinking has become paranoid, irrational and not normal. I\u2019m not very good company at the moment because I assume everybody dislikes me so I don\u2019t bother trying to make friends and avoid men I don\u2019t know altogether. \n\nThis is all affecting my relationship, my job, my home life,  health. \nI\u2019m so angry because of how I feel inside and no one seems to understand why it\u2019s so hard. \nMy partner is finding it harder and harder to be around me, because I\u2019m so on edge. \nMy heart is so broken, how do I keep going? Please tell me I can get better.",

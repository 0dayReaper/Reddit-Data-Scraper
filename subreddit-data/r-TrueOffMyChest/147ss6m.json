    "postText": "I was on my lunch break when I saw a maybe 10 yr old kid standing alone on the sidewalk. A car pulled up to them and they kind of walked away from it, then the car reversed to continue to talk to them. The kid continued to walk away but the car didn\u2019t follow this time. I circled back and asked the kid if they were okay, they said yes so I continued walking. About 5-10 mins later I walked back over asked them again if they were okay and offered them my phone to use, they said the person in the car was their cousin and was talking to their grandma.  I had to get back to work so I told them where I worked and said if they needed to make a call or need something stop by, they were walking up towards the building when the cousin stop them and they got into the car. I don\u2019t know if that person was there cousin or not, I should have pressed more but I didn\u2019t want to be a \u201cKaren\u201d inserting myself into a situation.  I just don\u2019t know why a kid would constantly be walking away from family they know. I\u2019m praying it was family.",

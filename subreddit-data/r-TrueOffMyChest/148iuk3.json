    "postText": "I 22M turn 23 on Friday. There\u2019s nothing to celebrate. I\u2019m going through a breakup after a 6 year relationship, my dad just put more core memory trauma into me in front of my whole family, and I\u2019m sitting in the shell of the house my ex and I used to occupy. My friends still want to celebrate me, but I can\u2019t even allow myself to be celebrated. I\u2019ve never liked my birthday, last year I got sexually assaulted and ruined it for my ex and now she\u2019s not even here anymore and I feel so alone with a village around me and I feel even worse because they\u2019re trying so so so hard to\nShow me they want to be here for me but I cannot help but feel like a burden and let people in. \n\nI hate myself. \nI hate my thoughts and actions. \nI don\u2019t want to exist anymore. \n\nI won\u2019t self harm but dying isn\u2019t out the question. \n\nI wish I were a normal person.",

            "comment": "First of all, there\u2019s no such thing as feeling like a normal person. Most of the \u201cnormal people\u201d you walk pass or encounter just have a mask over themselves, hiding their true issues and problems. Theres people who want to be like me; good career, great body physique, I travel a lot, etc. but deep down, I\u2019m a total mess. All those characteristics are just things I do to kill my insecurities. \n\nI\u2019m 25(m) and I feel for you. My ex broke up with me a week before my 22nd birthday for another guy, while dealing with post college depression because I was more lost after college. My friends did a surprise party for me but I was still lost, depressed, insecure, and wasn\u2019t in the mood. So I understand, how you feel. Hating on yourself is because you lost your confidence and personality due to trauma. It happens a lot.\n\nThe crazy thing is, 3 years ago\u2014I wanted to kill myself. After a lot of hard work, and perseverance. I got a good paying job in two years. I worked out for 3 years. I started to eat healthier. I had tons of hobbies, I traveled a lot. I got way closer to my friends, I became more open with them with my feelings as I hid everything from them for a long time. I met so many people. I started to go on many dates. I started going out more. Life is good now\u2014I still feel lost and lonely but I feel alive. Even my ex wanted to get back with me recently, if she asked a year ago I would have said yes but now, I\u2019m in a WAY better position than I ever was and I moved on. I\u2019m\nmore confident as a person that I know there\u2019s someone better for me out there than her now. \n\n\nThese are the things I\u2019ve learned in the last 3 years.\n\n- working on myself. Doesn\u2019t matter what you do but start something and stick with it, don\u2019t half ass it. Do something you ALWAYS wanted to do and work on it. I\u2019ve had so many hobbies in the last 3 years but it showed me what I was truly interested in. Cycling, Gym, Rock climbing, traveling, cooking, building, crafting, etc. these are things that\u2019ll make you feel better when you sleep and are total stress relievers. \n- Meditate: I never thought meditation helps and I never believed in it. But it is a total stress reliever. Meditate when you feel stressed, before you sleep, or when you wake up. Something as fast as a 5 min meditation helps!\n- socialization is super important. Stop staying home all day and being alone. Force yourself to go out, even if it\u2019s just for a quick lunch with a friend. There are times when you should be alone but humans are social animals. We generally feel happier and more alive when we\u2019re with people. Although people in urban cities have other issues, the one thing most of them have is better mental stability and social happiness. \n- Therapy: I never believed in therapy but I started to see a therapist once a mount or every two weeks. To keep my goals align and vent. You should try it out. \n\n*Go out with the people you love this Friday. Don\u2019t act fake, try to enjoy the little things in life, and enjoy your 22nd birthday. Use this 22nd birthday as you a new chapter of your life! Until Friday, go cry, go feel depressed, be lazy. BUT remember when you TURN 22. It\u2019s a new chapter from here, no more excuses, no more sad boy life.*\nYou got this. If I can go from a 220lb fat depressed boy to now an extremely healthy, athletic, and mentally stable person. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m now struggling with quarter life crisis. But that just how life is, it puts you down but it\u2019s your choice to get back up.\n\nTL;DR: Learn to love yourself by working on yourself. Don\u2019t quit, really put everything you got into whatever you\u2019re interested in. Don\u2019t get lazy, don\u2019t rely on substances, get healthier, work out, etc. go to therapy if needed, and mediate. Put yourself out in the world, and socialize for social skills and mental stability.",

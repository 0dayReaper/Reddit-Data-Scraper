    "postText": "I base my whole self worth on my looks. I know I'm only as good as how hot I look. If i don't get flirted with or told I'm attractive or look cool at least once a day I'll feel like shit. I'm only a mediocre girlfriend and it's not like being a bar tender requires lots of skills. I know one day I won't be perceived as hot and I'm not sure what I'll do then. I wish I was smart or skilled or anything but no I'm shallow and the only thing I've got going for me is that i'm attractive and I hate it",

What does matter is how much effort they put into learning that thing. \n\nI've seen the \"dumbest\" people get the highest grades and the \"smartest\" people fail. It's actually a common refrain \"he is so smart but he doesn't apply himself\". \n\nIf you want to succeed at something you just have to keep trying, even it takes more than a couple attempts.\n\nI have a friend who failed calculus 3 four times, and I remember I kept telling him \"take it again\". He finally passed got his degree and now makes over 100k, found a awesome wife and has a kid on the way. He attributes part of current success to me, because I kept encouraging him to continue. \n\nAnd also, I am encouraging you. Pick something and NEVER give up. Keep at it if it takes the rest of you life. You'll master the basics, then the intermediary, then you'll get really good.",

Not only are other people more willing to help you, they will often presume you are less intelligent and explain things like you are a child.\n\nHave you tried being less hot?  Not at the bar, make your money, but everywhere else in life?",

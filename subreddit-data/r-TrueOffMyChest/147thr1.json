    "postText": "My wife recently cut her hair and I can't say I'm as much in love with her anymore. I haven't told her yet and I might fall back in love with her once her hair grows back out, but the couple of friends I have who haven't ghosted me think I'm totally crazy and should get over it. I guess it is kind of stupid, but I can't help it. It's involuntary. I can't get my body to respond to what I'm not attracted to. It happens in so many other ways too. There's a coworker I thought was super hot and of course, I wasn't going to act on it, but once she started gaining weight and stopped wearing as much makeup, the crush was pretty much gone. \n\nWhat sealed the deal for me with turning me off of her was the day she brought this massive pulled-pork sandwich to work and I just knew it would make her ass even bigger. With all of my past partners, it was always an issue if they stopped wearing makeup, changed their hairstyle too much, didn't shave their legs, or put on a few pounds. I'm also worried for the day my wife gets her first wrinkle. Once a woman gets even a single wrinkle, she's immediately like an old lady to me and therefore unattractive.\n\nI've clearly succumbed to society and can't get my brain to move past the narrow beauty standards I've been taught straight men are supposed to be attracted to, but it all feels as real as my sexual orientation.",

That\u2019s not normal to entirely emotionally check out from your marriage because you think your spouse\u2019s haircut is bad.",

    "postText": "I want to start with some context. I (27 F) am married to a 30 M who is disabled and we are currently going through a workers comp case. We were living with my parents while the case is happening. My parents are divorcing and long story short my mother forced us out. We are currently in a hotel room with some of our things. \n\nWe have been in this room for almost a month and my father said he would go in on an apparent with us. We have sent him apartments, houses, trailers, everything in between. But he is an alcoholic who is in denial.\n\nI send him a text after another binge and he was refusing to give a straight answer about going to see rentals that we sent to him again to look at because the room at the hotel is only rented until the end of the week. \n\nThis was the text I sent:\n\u201cWe need the RV then\u2026 we cannot rely on you right now because we have been sending you listings for almost a month now, how long w have been in this room. You said you wanted to move in together but you don\u2019t respond about the listings.\n\nWe will not be staying with Ron and Susie.. \n\nEither we get an RV tomorrow or we will be settling the case and moving because we cannot keep doing this dance. David and I cannot keep in this state of anxiety and looking. I understand your depression is bad.. but so is ours and David\u2019s life is on the line. \n\nYou promised that we would have a resolution to this hotel situation before the hearing but that\u2019s not happening. It\u2019s been almost a month and it\u2019s not fair. We cannot personally afford to do this dance anymore both mentally/emotionally and financially. None of us can. \n\nSo let us know the finally resolution to this, because we will be contacting the lawyer in the morning for the workers comp. This has been very hurtful to us because we are relying on you.\u201d\n\nHe still has not replied\u2026",

Why solely rely on your dad and not both parents?",

But the TRO has caused us to forcibly move out and we cannot be within 100 yards of her or the house.",

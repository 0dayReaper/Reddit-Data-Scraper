    "postText": "I (20F) am in a LDR with the most amazing guy (20M). I can confidently say without a doubt he is the love of my life and I will marry him one day, so doing long distance is worth it but had to say goodbye for the first time today and oh my god I was not prepared for how hard it would be. I am a mess. I cried majority of last night and today and he was amazing but no one can prepare you for how hard it is. I miss him so much already and can\u2019t wait for him to come back. I can\u2019t wait for our future together and to not have to do this anymore.",

Think about the positive aspects of LDR - you can still hang out with your own friends, explore your likes and activities you enjoy, while having a bf who you can share your thoughts and feelings with at the end of the day (or the beginning of the day lol). You have a long journey with him so why not enjoy your moments with self now?",

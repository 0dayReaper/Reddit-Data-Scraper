    "postText": "I just started working only recently and my anxiety and whatever else i have is just through the roof right now to the point it's just clouding my thoughts heavily. I don't know how to make it stop, I want to cry and just doing everything all together. I wasnt like this in school, maybe its because I havent been to school in over four years. I havent talked to anyone outside of my family except the authorities or nurses taking care of my grandparents before they died a year or two ago. \n\nI want a job, friends, freedom, I feel so messed up and I don't know what to do. \n\nMy mistakes at work are very stupid mistakes and shouldn't be hurting me but they are. I feel so bad for the people I've messed up for. \n\nThis man wanted three short cigarettes he told me so, he told me, but I gave him two shorts and a long and smiled awkwardly after I rung him up and he said something about it. Because he told me shorts and I got him a long. He already paid and I said sorry. Like what the fuck is wrong with me. \n\nHow do I even make friends. I want my own place, my own soace away from the world, but I just started working and it's tearing me up inside. I havent even been paid yet\n\nI feel trapped with my family even my sister who im freaking intimidated by. She's as bad as the rest of my family but acts like she is better. It's 3:am and I got work in a few hours but I can't fucking sleep. Im a huge reck right now.\n\nI'm so tired, angry, and irriated. I can't afford therapy. I don't have anyone to talk to or anyone I trust. What can I do? I don't know.",

That guy could\u2019ve pointed out the mistake before paying, he didn\u2019t, that\u2019s not on you. \n\nThe trick is realizing you made a mistake, owning up to it, not repeating it if you can, and letting go of the negative feelings. It\u2019s simple, but not easy. It\u2019s going to be alright, but it\u2019s going to be hard, because it\u2019s new. \n\nAs to the rest, try meditation, exercise, healthy eating and getting enough sleep. This will help with your mental health, and make your mistakes easier to accept. Again, simple but not easy.",

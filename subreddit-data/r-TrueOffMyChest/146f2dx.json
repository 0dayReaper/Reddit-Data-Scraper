    "postText": "This is going to be so messy because I\u2019m currently crying.\n\nBackground: I (20F) recently got in a fight with my mom because I want to leave the Catholic Church (multiple reasons including being abused by a priest). And I just found out I probably can\u2019t have kids because of a uterus deformity.\n\nToday my family asked me to go to church with them, so I did to be respectful. I got so anxious because there were many big families with children and that\u2019s something I may never have so I went outside to get fresh air. I ended up having a complete breakdown and couldn\u2019t go back in, so I missed the last 15 minutes of mass.\n\nMy mom yelled at me and said I\u2019m a horrible person and to not bother showing up at home anymore. She assumed I left because I hate Catholics and she said she so disappointed in me. She canceled dinner plans that were made to celebrate an accomplishment of mine and said she\u2019s fasting for my sins, so it\u2019s my fault she won\u2019t be eating. \n\nI hate myself",

It all seems to depend what church they go to and it's really surprising how differently they see the world.",

Long history of faith formation, lots of ministries, all my sacraments, blah blah blah.\n\nIt is normal for parents to be upset that their child wants to leave the church, but it is NOT ok for parents to call their kids names and condemn them because they're questioning their faith.\n\nYour mom should absolutely not have treated you like that. Period. \n\nFasting for you, praying for you, you know as a Catholic, that's a thing we do. But she's being a false martyr about this. Maybe she is concerned for your mortal soul but treating you poorly doesn't bring you back.\n\nI sincerely hope that you reported that priest. If the person who you reported it to did not do what he or she is supposed to, then go to the next person up and keep reporting it up the chain. FILE A POLICE REPORT. Get it documented. \n\nAs for kids, please remember that there is no requirement for a Catholic to have a huge family. You're just \"supposed to be open to the creation of life\" when you're having sex with your husband. If you WANT a big family, there's no doubt that adopting and loving children would certainly be doing God's work. \n\nLastly, if you really want to leave the church, know that you can always come back. And know that you can still have God in your life if you choose. I wrestle with remaining a Catholic  in light of the disgusting abuse we know damn well has and is happening. But this is how I feel: I'm here to worship God, not priests. I'm here to support my community, and one way to do that is to help fix our system so we can ge these predators out and arrested for their crimes. \n\nI cannot possibly tell you how to think or feel about your faith. You and I have different experiences. All I can do is encourage you to keep an open heart to what God might be asking if you. God does not stop loving us just because we question our faith. We must ask questions in order to get answers. I pray you stay - - but you know what your feelings are, you know what your beliefs and relationship with God is like. Only you can make the choice to stay or go. Maybe mom makes things difficult, makes you feel guilty, treats you badly. But this is between you and God, not you and mom. You're not leaving your relationship with mom, you want to leave your relationship with the church. She needs to support you and encourage you to stay with love, not with anger.\n\nI'll pray for you to have clarity and discernment on what to do next, and that your anxiety lessens. And as someone who had severe anxiety, if you're able to, see a councelor or therapist etc. Anxiety can cloud our logical mind and you've got too much happening with mom and your faith to be thinking clearly. You deserve an opportunity to be confident in your choices.",

I hope you travel, find a partner and you find peace and all the happiness. \n\nJust so you know - religion was a construct created to make a human good and be good with others. We humans misconstrue everything...including religion. Instead of religion guiding us, we guide religion now and force it on others. People who realize this, tend to become agnostic or atheists. \n\nI wish for all the happiness in your life.",

Im no theologian but Im pretty sure brute-forcing religion on people is not in the Bible.\n\nBest to get away and give them a chance to process. Hopefully they can come around and stop being toxic, but that choice is 100% theirs.\n\nIf they really love you they will accommodate your belief system and values, even if it doesnt fit with their own view of the world.\n\nPeople learn and grow. Sometimes it just takes time. Im not saying this will all be fine - I expect things will be rocky for a while, but with any luck - if they are actually decent people - they will climb down off their high horse and love you for who you are.\n\nIf they cant do that its better to keep your distance and live your own life, and seek family of your own making (friends, community).\n\nWhatever happens it sounds like getting out of there is absolutely the right move forward. I wish you all the best, and Im sorry all this happened to you.",

Honestly you have to think of them like robots. They are incapable of reasonable thought or common sense, they have no morals. I was groomed and assaulted by a man in the kingdom hall I grew up in and they refused to let me go to the police. The actually gaslit me into thinking it was some kind of forbidden love for a long time. I was a 15 year old child. When I did go to the police at 19 I was shunned by everyone I ever knew. You know why? Because their love is conditional. It's not real and they're monsters.\n\nI know how scary it is but please dont let them manipulate you. You deserve the world and these trash human beings will only hurt you.",

You may have to take the first step.\n\nAnyways hope you and your Mom can both forgive each other and mend your relationship.",

    "postText": "i (19f) am over 6 months drug free. i still go to NA regularly. the last time i went, about half way through i went out for a smoke with another member who\u2019s my friend cos they needed a break and asked me to come. there was a dude violently withdrawing on the far side of the parking lot. there was a bit of back and fourth between wheather it\u2019s a good idea for me to go over to see if he\u2019s okay, and i just stopped debating and started going over to him, my friend went back inside.\ni approached him very cautiously in case he was in some sort of psychosis but he wasnt violent or aggressive at all he just\u2026. cried to me. he was visibly wet with sweat but kept telling me he was freezing cold. he kept rocking back and fourth and letting out cries of pain. \ni asked if i could touch him, and he said yes so i rubbed his back and gave + helped him smoke a cigarette. \nat this point i started some sort of domino affect because everyone on the block started coming out of there houses, one lady even gave ME a bottle of water for him- he was scaring people, but i could see he was also scaring himself. \nthen this dude came out and asked me (as i was sitting right next to the man on the side walk rubbing his back and telling him it\u2019s okay and no one\u2019s mad at him we all have bad days etc.) if he should call 911 and immediately the man started yelling no. so i made a motion to signal that i think yes he should. so he did call 911. and then 911 requested to him to speak to me. so i answered a bunch of questions and they asked that i get a defibrillator and i said i could i go look for one in the church but then they said no don\u2019t leave him since you\u2019re the only one he trusts right now. \ni asked by standers to go into the church for a defibrillator but they were kinda shocked and out of it couldn\u2019t really respond or do what i asked..? so i ran inside the church looking for a defibrillator but couldn\u2019t find one in the building so i ran across the parking lot back to him just a minute before ambulance came. \nwhen the paramedics came he started screaming more \u201cno\u201d and \u201cno help\u201d and even some \u201cscrew off\u201ds. \nthe paremedics had absolutely no interest in helping him! they wouldn\u2019t even take a minute to explain to my why he\u2019s in a good enough head space to not formed for his own safety. \ni think he will be found dead on the side walk in a few weeks and i can\u2019t help but think no one with the power to help him wanted to. \nand i also feel shitty. i feel embarrassed for trying to help in a situation where i should\u2019ve known i couldn\u2019t.",

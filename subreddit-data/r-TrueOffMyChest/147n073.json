    "postText": "I turned 28 years old today and I'm overwhelmed with emotions. \nWhile at dinner with my boyfriends family yesterday, I talked about how I don't really give a damn about my birthday. It's been like that for several years and I sometimes get annoyed by people expecting me to feel excitement. \n\nThis year it feels totally different. \nFirst, my dad wrote me a message early in the morning (as soon as he woke up for work) and called me his \"sweet daughter\". He never ever called me that. At this point I was already bawling my eyes out. He called me a few hours after that from work and we talked for a while and it was a really nice talk. \n\nThen my mother called me, wishing me a happy birthday. Now, my parents never really told me and my brother that they *love* us. It's like they are incapable of saying the word \"love\" out loud. They are more the \"actions speak louder than words\" typ of people. Since I moved out a few years ago, my mother started saying that she \"really really likes\" me a lot. Her way of saying, that she loves me. Although today was no different, for some reason I felt that she was really close to saying that she loves me. Her sister and brother send their birthday wishes through my mother. Even and old friend of my mom reached out to her to congratulate on her daughters birthday. My mother emphasized that there are people who care about and thinking about me a lot. I was silent crying throughout the call, because I was just filled with happiness. \n\nTo some people this might be nothing special, that's how they feel on all birthdays. And maybe this is not special at all. But I never felt as loved as I feel loved today. \n\nI know it's hard for a lot of people out there. I know there is a lot of people who don't feel loved. So today, I'm sending my love to all of you!",

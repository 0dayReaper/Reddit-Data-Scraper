I don\u2019t feel any sense of familiarities. \nSo am I looking for someone who no longer exists but is dressed in the same skin as me? \nI\u2019ve attempted to lure this space with those that are the accessories of me, just hoping to exonerate the fulfillments that profusely bled the color of each passivity endeavored the plasters to the final mold, of the person I am..\nOr use to be... \nno - the person I thought I was.. \nBut if what once was my knowledge of what defined me, was stripped and refined of me - set back to the based sculpt of a body that\u2019s no longer housed by me, but instead awaits a new build that\u2019ll be yet another unfamiliarity. What am I suppose to do?\nI can\u2019t find who I was, when she is wiped of ever even being. \nI am unsure of another place to look, to find the host for me to meet, who\u2019s the new me. I swear I\u2019ve searched many places, for so achingly long now. I don\u2019t think I be looking anymore, because I\u2019m tired and discouraged, and I might have convinced myself that there doesn\u2019t need to be another me.. \nSay I do find her somehow, someway; how do I even relearn the pieces of them that are sealed between a million different layers that I can\u2019t even reach\u2026 when I was never good at learning anyone  that wasn\u2019t me?  \nI feel like all I\u2019m ever going to be is just another fill like the rest, used as an extra in the background.\nMaybe I\u2019ll just be..",

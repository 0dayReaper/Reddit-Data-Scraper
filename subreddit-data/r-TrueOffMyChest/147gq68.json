    "postText": "For context, my grandma (81F) and I (28F) have always been close. She has admitted to me that I am her favorite grandchild and we have a lot in common. She also holds me to a very high standard when it comes to her morals. I was raised in the LDS (mormon) church growing up, and for a long time I was an active member. That's not the case anymore. My grandma and mom still have faith in the church, especially my grandma. She doesn't know I don't believe in it anymore but she knows I don't go to church.\n\nOne of the biggest reasons I left the church was because they preach that it is sinful to have sex unless it's someone of the opposite sex that you're married to. I am bisexual. I've known for sure since I was 13 and came out to my immediate family around this time. My mom wasn't super supportive at first but now she is.\n\nThroughout my teen years and early adulthood I decided that I would bury the part of me that liked women. I thought I would eventually meet a man, get married, live the gospel, and everything would be fine. I discovered in time that hiding who I really am was poisoning my spirit day by day. I'm now at a point where I'm not ashamed of who I am. Recently I decided that I finally want to come out to the world. Here's where things went sideways. \n\nI attended a pride event with my sister one day. When I told my grandma I was going she rolled her eyes. I asked her if she had a problem with that and she said she had a problem with me being \"seduced by that lifestyle.\" This really upset me, but my mom insisted that my grandma would accept me because of her love for me, and my mom and sister encouraged me to come out to her. Here's where things go downhill.\n\nMy mom had a whole speech where she tried to explain that I was born this way, not seduced by anyone. She also brought up the fact that my grandma holds me to an unreasonably high standard. My grandma started crying immediately and said \"I don't think you are bisexual. I've known you your whole life.\" When I insisted that I was she cried more and said we needed to give her time to \"grieve\" me. As if I had fucking died. She said she was heartbroken, and I'm not who she thought I was. \n\nRemember when I said we have a lot in common? One of those things is holding grudges. I just can't seem to let go of the hurt and anger I feel due to being rejected by someone I love. I know that she still loves me (she said so). I know she's over 80 years old and set in her ways. I know how much she's given me in my life (financing my education being a big one). I know that her mind is starting to go. Despite knowing all this, I cannot bring myself to forgive her. I wish I could just let it go but it's still fresh in my mind. And the icing on the cake is that I have to help take care of her because she recently contracted covid. I desperately need time away from her so I can process my hurt and anger without having to see her every day. I just wanted to rant, thanks for listening.",

But your the same people you have both always been, bonds dont form over religious beliefs or sexual orientation, it's where souls meet and love grows. Yes she'll never change her mind probably, but she will always have that part of her that lives you as much as she hates to admit it. Be the bigger person, let it go and just be the person you have always been with her. Just remember she's not got forever left and she might need you more than you will ever know.",

            "comment": "Grew up Mormon and came out after my Mission. Did not go well and I'm low contact with most of my family to this day. It's super hard to have family turn their back on you and it hurts a lot so I'm sorry what your going through. \n\nMy biggest problem with my family is I didn't stand up to their hate until our relationship was too far gone. I do have a relationship with a brother but that's about it. You are worth love and if \"family\" can't give it, it's time to rethink the relationship despite the past.\n\nFYI, don't help with your grandma. Her actions need to have consequences and it would be best to tell her that.",

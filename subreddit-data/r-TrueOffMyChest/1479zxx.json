    "postText": "Ugh. 8 months relationship ended horribly with a girl I know for nearly two years as friends, never dating a friend again. Lots of red flags in the relationship and yes I stayed after she told me \u201cI can\u2019t love you like how you want\u201d. Last two months distance\u2019d herself from me to focus on school and I convinced myself if this is what she needed it\u2019s okay. She ended up having a lot of resentment towards me and I started to get some to but for different reasons like her practically ignoring me. Blocked, and from her friend \u201cshe wants nothing to do with you now or and the future.\u201d. It\u2019s been a month, and that phase haunts me, especially because I don\u2019t have much if any negative feelings towards her. It hurts to lose someone especially since I refused to let things end on a bad note considering how we met. \n\nWhat sucks the most is if there someone who she is more compatible with (our main issue arised from this) I would want her to be with them. If she needed to block me for her mental health I\u2019m happy she did. I think it\u2019s okay to feel multiple feelings about a person but it also feels to weird.",

You did everything you humanly could, and if that still wasn\u2019t good enough. Then let her go, she doesn\u2019t deserve you. If your main issue arises from another person. She\u2019s interested in them and not you.\nBut please take this as you need to put yourself first. If she\u2019s not interested in you that\u2019s HER problem. Not yours. You can find someone who will love you the way you want without having to say it. Keep standing tall.",

I did everything I could to the point even the effort made her displeased. She was dealing with a lot personally and I want to say it was also a case of wrong timing. I tend to be hypercritical of myself and past mistakes I made with this person; hearing \u201cput yourself first, she didn\u2019t deserve you\u201d etc means a lot. I think it\u2019s the next stage I need to get to.",

If she said jump, I would, but then again it wasn\u2019t high enough for her. \n\nI am the same way by being hypercritical myself. But moving forward always remember: other people\u2019s opinions DO NOT determine your value as a human being.",

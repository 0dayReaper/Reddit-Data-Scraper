    "postText": "It's not even been a year since my grandparents passed away. But little things just keep reminding me that they are gone. For context I used to live with them, well my mom's parents. All I've ever known was my family consisting of me, my mom, and my grandparents. That's all I would put in words when you would have to draw your family for a school project. Well before covid my grandmother had been getting sick. Not physically but mentally. It was early-set dementia. It was quite hard seeing her slip away from reality, it truly did hurt more when she didn't know who I was or the constant yelling at my mom about her bringing nonexistent people into the house. What was best for her was a facility that could look after her since my house had too many stairs and just wasn't accessible to older people. It took 2 years for her to slip away. My mom was with her that day and said she wasn't going to come home and told me to sleep. I couldn't and I guess my body knew why. She came home that night and I guess it just wasn't registering in my head that she was gone. I truly never cried that hard in my life. I thought I wouldn't, I had already had a funeral for her in my mind when she couldn't remember me. But I guess physically is much harder. Then my grandfather died 6 weeks apart from her. He just wasn't in the greatest health as long as I've been alive. Always fell and just couldn't walk. This was the begging of August of my senior year. It was truly hard trying to stay happy for my mom, it now is just us. We are all each other has. Well, I just graduated. And my 18th birthday is coming up. I'm going to college on a scholarship. I'm now in a relationship. And all those things keep bringing me back to the idea they will not see me get married, have kids, get to see me thrive in life. And it's just hard. I miss them more than I thought.",

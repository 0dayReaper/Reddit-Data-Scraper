For the vast majority of subreddits all the mod team really does is patrol and remove wrongthink. The idea that there are specific rules you have to violate or any kind of process to appeal your ban is complete nonsense. \n\nFor people who are unaware of this effect, they simply think that whatever ideas the sub values are unchallengeable. In reality every day there are dozens of people who are making solid counterpoints that could alter you opinions or give you a more nuanced understanding of the ones you already hold. But that\u2019s not what Reddit is. It\u2019s Red vs. Blue. It\u2019s no wonder that among millions of people and countless billions of man hours, moments of true learning or accord are impossibly rare. \n\nYou literally have a much better chance of having a sensible conversation and learning about other viewpoints by going down your roughest local bar, getting pissed, and talking to randoms than you do on Reddit.\n\nIt\u2019s a criminal waste of the greatest communication tool mankind ever developed.

That's the biggest gripe I have about the voting. r/politics tends to hide everything it finds controversial in a special hell of downvotes. Most articles that show any critique of the status quo tend to be hidden in that special place of nothingness. People then can't see it or comment on it unless they're explicitly looking for it. \n\nThat, and moderators *facepalm* - they are the worst! Literally a bunch that is not only hidden from purview but punitive at best. I have seen so many times people baiting others who lose their shit for obvious reasons, and then the moderators punish those who lose their shit.",

People have much more ability to affect change when they are acting on behalf of local causes, and they are more likely to build strong ties to real people through focuses on local issues. \n\nSocial media, by contrast, acts as a psychic dumping ground for our collective outrage.

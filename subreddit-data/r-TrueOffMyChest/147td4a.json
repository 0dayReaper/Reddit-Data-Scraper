He's the sweetest man I've ever met and he treats me good. I love him to death but for some reason I feel away from him and it's killing me inside. I can't stop thinking about everything that went wrong between us from the start to this day. Can anyone please tell me what the fuck is wrong with me atm? I can't stand this feeling.",

I\u2019ve been on both sides.  The nice guy getting the breakup speech I mean.  If you do decide to split ways, please don\u2019t do what I did\u2026\n\nMid conversation- \u201cI don\u2019t love you\u201d\n\nIt was bothering me so much inside and she was carrying the conversation on her shoulders.  I just blurted it out.  Funny looking back on it, but damn did my delivery do damage.  one of my top regrets for sure",

Because I did this once to a girl and I doubt I\u2019ll ever truly forgive myself.  I was a child.  But multiple times?  And forcing you to go through with any level of sexual interaction would be sexual assault at best.  You really should talk with someone you trust about it and probably report him.\n\n&gt; Even though he apologized for his behavior and I forgave him, \n\nWere his apologies genuine though?\n\n&gt; I cannot stop thinking about it. I feel stained. I got over it for a short period of time but it's all coming back again and I just feel like I've been stained permanently.\n\nDo you mind if I ask for a little more detail into what you mean by stained?",

Even if you can\u2019t find the source of the problem it\u2019s not fair to your significant other to pretend to have feelings of affection when you know they don\u2019t exist anymore. I just went through a similar situation and realized that the second I had that feeling I should text my girlfriend and talk about it and we ended up breaking up that same night. I know it\u2019s scary but it\u2019s so much better for both parties to not drag it out longer than it needs to be",

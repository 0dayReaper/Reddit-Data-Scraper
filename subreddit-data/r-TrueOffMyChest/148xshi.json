    "postText": "My little sister in elementary has repeatedly ranted and cried over how she is constantly ignored/avoided at in school. Firstly, I made sure that her hygiene wasn't the problem so that can't be it. But I do know that the kids in her classroom tend to have very different interests from her. It has even gone so far to affect her academic performance like intentionally leaving her out of group works or making her do everything or assigning her a role then taking it back after she has done the work. I tried talking to the teacher and principal but nothing really came out of it. There was even worse cases (sexual harrassment) that got ignored.\n\nHer situation mirrored the way I was treated when I was in elementary myself. She doesn't know my past so it is impossible for her to lie about it. I, too, was also constantly ignored and avoided by my peers and they would also call me mean things. The sad part is that I am an extrovert, I feel refreshed by social contact but sadly life doesn't have it this way.\n\nThankfully, no one bullies me anymore but I still suffer from severe loneliness with a very small social group. I have two best friends but it is obvious that we are drifting apart. I never made any friends in the newer schools I went to. People were amicable and nice to me and vice versa but never anything more. I joined many orgs but I ended up with 100% work and 0% friends.\n\nI really want to help my sister and I honestly think this might actually be some weird genetical problem running in both me and her (we are also the only ones in the family with atopic dermatitis). Even if not, I would like to hear some advice on how to lift her spirits and improve her social skills. I really don't want her to end up like me: jumping between hope and anger towards the world. Thank you.",

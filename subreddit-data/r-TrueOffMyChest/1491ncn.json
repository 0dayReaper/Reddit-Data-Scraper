    "postText": "I found out a few days ago that my husband of 3 years has cheated on me with multiple women while we\u2019ve been apart. The reasoning was questionable but I don\u2019t know what to do. I love him so deeply but my pride refuses to falter. I told him I\u2019d be willing to stay if he begged and if I slept with the same amount of people but he refuses. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d actually sleep with anyone but he doesn\u2019t even seem like he really feels bad about it. I\u2019m so hurt. I wish he\u2019d fight for me at least which I know might sound stupid to some but I\u2019ve been in love with him since forever and I\u2019m just. I don\u2019t know how to cope with the loss of the man I love you know. I don\u2019t know who to ask for advice and I thought it might be because I don\u2019t want to be judged but honestly I just don\u2019t want it to end. I feel like every part of me is slowly suffocating and I just don\u2019t want to function. I\u2019m surrounded by lively people and all I want is to slip away into nothing. I feel so alone and helpless and all I want is someone to tell me what to do. To tell me that my feelings are valid and that everything will work out. I\u2019m losing my mind and I\u2019m losing any bit of faith I have in anything. I feel like I\u2019m constantly being beat down and it\u2019s just breaking me. Thank you for reading up till now and for any helpful responses.",

My feelings would instantly turn from love to disgust.\n\nMaybe you love the life you had and the person he was but thats already gone so the question is if the life you have now and the person he is now is worth sticking around for\n\nETA: I mean you can better your life, NOT end it",

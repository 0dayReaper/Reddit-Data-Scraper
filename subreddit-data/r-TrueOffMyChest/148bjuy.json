    "postText": "I\u2019m 18(f) and I am turning 19 in a few months. I graduated from high school just this March. My friends and most of the people I know who are my age all got into a university except me, I was rejected by the same university three times. For context I have two younger sisters who are still in school so my dad has to single handling three kids because we lost our mom five years ago. The bills that my dad has to pay are way more than the incomes so sending me to a good university isn\u2019t an option I know this which is why I picked the best and the cheapest one and the nearest one to home. I love learning English and literature, I\u2019m also really good at it (for a foreigner who\u2019s native language isn\u2019t English) and that was the major I applied to but unfortunately I wasn\u2019t accepted. I feel so stress and lost seeing all my friends getting in posting about their uni life while I have no clue what to do next. And because I\u2019m Asian the pressure of my family and the society that puts on me are great. People keeps asking me what am I studying and I have to watch as their face turned blank and confused and disappointed when I said I got rejected I know they probably think I\u2019m stupid and that\u2019s why. I do have a dream of being a florist and to open my own flower shop so I am thinking if I should reapply to a university next year or should I start working. A lot of people tried to cheer me up by telling me you don\u2019t have to get in uni to be successful but i do like learning still and I do want a degree too because in my country when hiring someone looking at their degree where they graduated from is important.",

            "comment": "Going to university right after high school is overrated and a lot of times just a bad idea! It\u2019s not realistic or fair to expect people that young to know what they want to do for the rest of their lives! I love your dream of being a florist:) I suggest finding a job at a florist so you can learn about the business while saving up money. When people ask you about what you\u2019ll be studying, you don\u2019t have to tell them that you didn\u2019t get accepted. Just say that you\u2019re going to take some time to work and help your family out. And remember that you don\u2019t have to go to school to study English or literature! The internet is an endless resource and you can learn the things that interest you most. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m very sorry for the loss of your mom. I\u2019m a mom and I just want to say that you\u2019re doing great and I\u2019m very proud of you &lt;3",

I agree with working at a flower shop if your goal is to own one. Also what about taking classes online in business while you work at a flower shop? I understand the stigma you\u2019re dealing with, but honestly I know so many successful people that didn\u2019t continue their education and once you\u2019re older you\u2019ll see that not every college graduate is smart, and not every high school dropout is dull.",

            "comment": "In other countries it is totally normal to take a year or even a few years after graduating to work or travel or do both at the same time haha. I took a year after school to work part time and enjoy life. I had a lot more free time than my friends who got into university right away. And you know what? Now that I am in University too, no one gives a sht about me starting a year later than usual. Everyone who started right away envies me that I took a year off between school and Uni.\n\n  \nYou are 19 years old. That is SO young. There is no way you can know what you want to do with the rest of your life now. I have a lot of friends who didnt choose a career until they were in their mid or late 20s. But you got to start somewhere, so maybe look for a flowershop you can work at for a little while if thats something you are interested in.\n\n  \nI totally get the feeling of being lost though. I think most people feel like this  once they get out of school. After all its all youve ever known and suddenly its over and you are all by yourself and responsible for every decision you make. Its scary. But guess what? Life doesnt end because there is one obstacle you couldnt take (Getting rejected from Uni) or because you make a wrong decision. You always get another chance at trying. Also, life doesnt have to be linear. The expected route of Highschool, Uni, work, family, death doesnt work for everyone. And thats not just fine, its awesome.",

    "postText": "\n\nHellooo I am 24 f and really don\u2019t like labeling things \u2026but it\u2019s Been a long time coming that I am not completely straight. I am interested in men and have had limited experience with them and throughout my life have had crushes on men and women but am just now willing to call those crushes on women actual *crushes*. \n\nAnyways. Here to say that I have a coworker that I suppose I have a crush on. I think she is beautiful (dare I say hot?) and I sooo envy her style and pretty much everything about her vibe. I find myself caring about her personal life. Weirdly enough\u2026she has appeared as a character in my dreams for like 6 months, which has been strange to consider. Nothing sexy yet and that doesn\u2019t make me swoon in the same way man stuff does sometimes but, yes, I have thought about her that way before I\u2019m still working on how to process these feelings. I don\u2019t really want to date her or anything but it\u2019s clear that I naturally feel a certain way about her. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to normalize my sexuality as being on a spectrum for a while now. I really only have interest in being with guys, but my \u201cgirl\u201d crushes have always seemed to hit emotionally harder due to emotional connection I believe most women share. \n\nAnyways. Here\u2019s my confession. I\u2019m almost ready to tell a few friends about it but I don\u2019t want all this labels business. I am what I am and I shall have a crush on whoever I damn well please.",

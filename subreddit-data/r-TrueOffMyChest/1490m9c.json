    "postText": "I'm going to a simple community college for mortuary sciences, but I need a liberal arts degree before that.\n\nI just graduated highschool and I got a C average, I wasn't a great student and I've always been a very distracted and anxious individual.\n\nI don't know what I'm gonna do. I just feel like I won't be able to pull through. I have to get above a C to pass the classes in college which is fair, it's fine. I'm just so uncertain if I'll be able to actually do it while working. I have the thought put in my head that I have to work a lot in order to even survive, my utilities will be included with my dorms rent.\n\nI'm just nervous. I'm not a very good student and I'm required to take a bunch of classes like Composition. When I took Comp in highschool I sucked at it, it was awful and I just couldn't do it.\n\nI feel a little lost right now. \n\nI'm in America btw, so I have to pay to be imprisoned and suffer in college, I don't have the luxury of an education being inexpensive or free.\n\nIn a sentence: The thought of college and everything has me all the way fucked up right now.",

    "postText": "It happened a long time ago so lawsuits and stuff probs wouldn\u2019t work plus the girl moved back to Ohio but let\u2019s begin, I was in 4th grade and this girl (let\u2019s call her Katy fake name ofc) moved in next to me and we slowly became friends, not a good friendship tho, very toxic. We would constantly get into arguments and she would manipulate to get her way or make me look like the bad guy. Katy made up lies constantly like she had cancer, she got piercings (sticky rhinestones) anyways it started when we had our first sleepover at her house and she made me touch her.. yknow. And after that I left and went home when she was asleep. Then we would play house and she would always make me touch her, or we would play boyfriend girlfriend where I was the boyfriend and she was the girlfriend. It went all the way the 6th grade when she moved away. She then would start going on me and touching me which made me uncomfortable and everytime I saw my mom I would feel so embarrassed and guilty and I thought it was cause she\u2019s also a girl. I never told anyone because I thought it was normal but I randomly remembered her a couple days ago and remembered that that happened. Idk if it\u2019s rape or something but the friendship def messed me up. I\u2019m 15 now and I\u2019m not traumatized or anything so maybe it wasnt rape, maybe somewhere in the spew of memories i consented?",

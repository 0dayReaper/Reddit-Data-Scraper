    "postText": "I am a 40 year old male virgin. I am hetereosexual, I'm not religious, and I'm not asexual or aromantic, before anyone asks. I'm also not physically disabled, so I would be phyisically able to have sex. \n\nI know there's some stigma attached to men being virgins, and especially men my age. I assume people would like to know why, and I could give a number of answers to that. \n\nI can genuinely say that dating or hooking up was never at the front of my mind, even in my teens and twenties. I'm a social introvert and prefer staying at home to going out clubbing and drinking, so that definitely had an impact on my behaviour. \n\nI never saw a girl and thought I should talk to her with the intent of something happening between us. It genuinely never crossed my mind. I have never had an inkling of why I should flirt and it never came up in any conversations. I understood the *concept* of flirting, in theory, but it never crossed my mind to apply it into practice. It also never occurred to me that any girl would show that kind of an interest in me. \n\nThere was an element of low self-image involved as well. For years, I had a hard time looking at myself in the mirror because I thought I was disgusting. It's over a decade since I felt that way about my own reflection, but self-doubt still lingers. I didn't like my body very much, and was worried about my weight and performance. I was also worried about my penis size, and that has stuck with me for years. \n\nSelf-image and social introversion aside, I don't share myself or my inner workings with people that easily. I guess I'm a somewhat private person. I often stay in my own head, although I don't mind a stimulating 1-on-1 conversation from time to time. \n\nI have dated, you might say, although they started online and for the most part stayed online. One girl came to visit me for 10 days, and we spent that time in a bed together. She was very shy, and I was too. All we did was fool around, kiss and touch each other, but she wasn't ready for more. We'd keep in touch for a while until I stoppd hearing from her one day. Another girl showed interest in me, and yes it was online. Turns out, she experienced a great deal of trauma in her life and just shut me out one day. That was back in 2011, and I've never tried any kind of dating since then. \n\nYears back, in my 20's, I recall a time where another guy touched me in a way I wasn't prepared for. I don't know if it affected me, but I recall freezing up and not knowing how to react. \n\nNow, I guess I just wonder whether my status will affect any future relationships. I'm attracted to women, but I wonder how it will all play out in an actual sexual relationship with a woman, given my age and lack of experience. I don't know if I could even tell them, if they'd know, or if they'd feel awkward about the whole thing.",

I might add that if you feel your introversion is getting in the way of your pursuing a relationship, maybe try and step out of your comfort zone occasionally to reach beyond your normal social approach, and be more open and direct with a woman you may be interested in",

It's the outside forces that bring shame into the picture. It's easy to think that what peole think of you is what you are, but I think that's wrong. You're not what others think you are. You are your own person, your own supreme being. You are in absolute authority over yourself. Nobody else is. \n\nI don't know what your trauma is, so I hope you find some help or resolution, but know that it doesn't make you less valuable or unique as a person. Others cannot take away who you are, and neither can trauma. I know it doesn't always feel that way, and I can attest to that, but you have a lot of potential within you. I feel stuck and without direction, and I can relate to you, but know that it's not hopeless.",

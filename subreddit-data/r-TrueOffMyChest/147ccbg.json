    "postText": "I work in tech. I\u2019ve been accused on here before for making my job my personality for things like being worried guys will be intimidated by my career, or worrying I won\u2019t have things in common with other women because of my job. Right now tech is a big part of my life due to the fact I am in a tech job and in a tech major for grad school. I also have non tech hobbies I engage in regularly.\n\nI never talk about my job unless asked. I do have social media that\u2019s tech related but that\u2019s for more like sharing information and networking with others.\n\nI\u2019m done with people online who don\u2019t even know who I am automatically assume I make my job my personality. I feel people on here don\u2019t take the time to understand instead they just jump straight into conclusions. \n\nAll my life I was made to feel different for being a woman in tech. I\u2019ve had people tell me tech is no place for me all because I present femininely. I\u2019ve been told I need to work extra hard to prove that I\u2019m worthy enough to be in tech all because I am a woman.\n\nI\u2019m done being judged. I come on here to find people who are going through the same as me.",

I am in the same boat, but with cars instead of tech(did the tech thing got bored lol) as a woman with some \"man\" job/hobbies people just make it suck with the thing you here all day like i do, get a real job, do hair not carbs, you have to work harder to earn less etc.... but hey, i say do what you love and work what you want. Ignore the rest.  Cheers and good luck. :)",

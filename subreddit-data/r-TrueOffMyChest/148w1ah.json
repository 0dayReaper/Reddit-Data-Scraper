He has a sport that takes up like 3-4 hours of his day, then he spends a lot of time playing video games. We\u2019ll call and play valorant or Minecraft together. Every week ish we go to the mall or go out for sushi. He always rushes to hug me. He would just say random shit that made no sense to me but I was happy to listen. He used to be super clingy always wanting to be held and just be around me. He\u2019s not like that anymore. He seems depressed, the only thing he does is his sport and games for like 12 hours. His texts have been dry but he realizes and says I love you after. If I go to his house all he wants to do is play video games. He doesn\u2019t want to come to my house anymore. Yesterday I held him and told him how special he was to me and I\u2019m worried about him. He said he\u2019s knows he\u2019s been off but doesn\u2019t know why. I remind him he can always talk or cry or just hold my hand and he nods. Today I asked if he was free tomorrow but I have stuff in the morning and he has stuff in the afternoon. He just said I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m confused so I ask why and he says he knows he\u2019s been an \u201casshole\u201d recently. I tell him that it\u2019s ok and stuff changes all the time. \nI don\u2019t know what to do. I desperately want to hold him and tell him all the amazing things he has done, how far he\u2019s come, and remind him that I love him. But I\u2019m scared. If I push will he just push away? Do I distance and wait for him to come around? I don\u2019t know. I want him back, I want to do stuff together again.",

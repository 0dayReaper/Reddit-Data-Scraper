    "postText": "I was recently promoted to shift lead. I\u2019ve made some mistakes but twice now I forgot to double check and make sure a specific task was completed. (I told a team member to do that task before he left and he didn\u2019t, and I was rushing to count money before midnight came otherwise I would have done it.) Only after I locked the doors and set the alarm did I realize my mistake.  \nSo I got written up. And as someone who never intentionally caused trouble in school and is very careful not to fuck up, I feel horrible. I\u2019ve learned my lesson now and I\u2019ve set reminders and alarms so I don\u2019t miss it again. I was doing well but today just shattered my confidence.",

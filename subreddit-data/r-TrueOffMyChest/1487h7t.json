    "postText": "Like the title says. I am sick of my partner and his fake ass. Nothing is ever good enough for him. I can never provide enough for him. No matter what I do it is never enough. I'm suppose to be the supportive girlfriend that does whatever he wants. It doesn't matter what I **need or want** it has to be all for him. The things I have had to endure for him to have what he want or what I have to put up with. It is never enough. And I can't say anything about the fact that he \"have\" DID because then I'm unsupportive if I question anything. When he gets tired of playing someone he just changes to a \"new\" person. But I know the truth: it is just him pretending to be someone different because it makes him the victim. He loves playing the victim. And I **hate** everything about it. I think I hate him too but I can't do anything because he made it where he relies solely on me. As if I wanted that. As if I asked for any of this. I fell for his stuff games and lies. While he just chills and does whatever he wants because he can't \"help\" it or that \"bothers\" him. I think the last straw though was that recently I was SA'd and r\\*ped pretty badly; And you know what? He made it all about how it sounded bad and he didn't like it. And then asked what was for supper. And when I finally broke down about it later on, he got pissed and made a big deal about how I wasn't letting him have his *feelings*. I'm so tired of this. Tired of living like this. Tired of just being alive. Sometimes I think death would be better. I think it really would be. At least I would finally get a fucking break.   \nI just needed to get this off my chest and since I have no friends: congrats reddit you get to read my shitty ramblings. ",

Oh wait I **have no** job because no potential employer has called me back even though I put application after application after application out. Don\u2019t have a car because my bank account is at 0. And nope no family (shitty people I cut out of my life years ago) or friends for support. But I will totally get on it right now. I can live on the streets again, it wasn\u2019t so bad. So what if I feared for my life every single night or have a heart condition that requires some type of temperature control. Don\u2019t judge my life by your own. Thanks for the gaslighting though. Very lovely.",

Telling anyone you don\u2019t believe them is gaslighting, whether you was trying to do that or not. If that wasn\u2019t the case then pick better words next time because finding it \u201chard\u201d to believe someone and stating it the way you is gaslighting. I bet you are the type of person that will also blame someone for getting assaulted or say they were asking for it. Whatever I\u2019m done with you.

Your words come across as OP said \u201clow-key\u201d gaslighting. The beginning stages that people don\u2019t notice because \u201cthat was just my advice\u201d bs. How about next time instead of telling someone you don\u2019t believe them you don\u2019t say a word and just scroll on. Because to them you saying I don\u2019t believe you is making them fucking question everything because if someone else says it isn\u2019t bad then it can\u2019t really be that bad. Been there and done that. So yes you were gaslighting because sometimes gaslighting isn\u2019t malicious or outright manipulation by a truly awful person. You want to show how much a good person you are? Then say sorry for your thoughtless comment and move on. Because right now your comments are either gaslighting or trying to make OP out to be a monster for not taking any crap. Do better next time.",

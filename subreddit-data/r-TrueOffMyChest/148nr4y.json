    "postText": "I\u2019m not sure what to do, or if I really just screwed myself this weekend. But I need to type this out cause I can\u2019t bring it up to anyone I know.\n\nI went to a strip club with some buddies of mine (first time for me, not really my thing but went and they were excited). I think them (club, dancers) knowing that was a bad move to start. We got a table &amp; bottle which was already an insane amount of money. I didn\u2019t really drink much and soon after we sat down I was bought a dance. This is where it all starts to go.\n\nShe dances on me for a song or two, cool. Then she tells me about the rooms and that my friends said I\u2019d love it blah blah, and I wasn\u2019t sure about what to say or do and next thing I know she\u2019s leading me into it and hasn\u2019t answered my questions about the prices and whatnot. The hostess comes in now with an iPad and takes my ID/Card and charges it but hasn\u2019t answered any questions other than I\u2019m getting an hour. I was told I get two free drinks in the room but they wouldn\u2019t give me whiskey and brought vodka instead. \n\nI\u2019m feeling really trapped so far and not sure what to do and the charge also has a tip on top of it (for the host that is just charging me??) and then I\u2019m being asked for my card AGAIN for the dancers tip? Which now also has a tip option?? Anyways my card is shut off from fraud prevention now and I\u2019m scared trying to figure out what I owe these girls and for what?? They\u2019re looking for different cards in my wallet and going through my phone trying to clear the fraud. I kept telling them it isn\u2019t going to work\n\nI give the dancer cash around $700 (it was supposed to be 600 but numbers kept changing. The time I purchased kept changing. She said I got 30 minutes but I kept arguing the hostess told me it was an hour and then she had me get out. My friends were pissed as was I. No dancing, no nothing in the room just dealing with all that, arguing with her where I\u2019m coming from, and then it being done. She was really condescending when I kept standing my ground on what I was told. I assume she expected me to be more drunk and less questioning about it?? The final charge on my card was $1600 + the cash I gave. I wish I was drunk to have a blame but I was just confused and scared and felt trapped. I don\u2019t know what to do from here as I\u2019ve already told my bank the charge was me because I don\u2019t want to be committing fraud.\n\nA lot of my fear here comes from hearing about how shady clubs can be with being run by organized crime and whatnot i think. I just feel so dumb\n\nI\u2019m afraid I have no way to get any of this back but I don\u2019t know what to do. Thanks for reading.",

They\u2019d be broke by the end of the weekend, I went with them after several rounds of excuses finally. I took only cash, left all my cards in my barracks room.\n\nGot two dances, ejaculated in my pants, tipped in cash and went back to base. All for $80.\n\nMoral of the story; only carry cash to these kinds of places. Never bring your card at all. Spare boxers not a bad idea either.",

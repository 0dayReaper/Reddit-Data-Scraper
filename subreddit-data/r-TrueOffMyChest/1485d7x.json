    "postText": "So I had this close friend who is big into most things nerdy and had a huge collection of Pok\u00e9mon cards.\nI am also a collector of Pok\u00e9mon cards and at the time I was big into expanding my collection.\n\nMy friend seemed to be on a downward spiral as far as social life/career path/adulthood goes and me and his other close friends were a bit concerned tbh. His borderline obsession with action figures and other collectibles by itself wasn\u2019t a problem but we didn\u2019t think it was helping him grow. I don\u2019t want to go into detail about why we thought this, but we certainly didn\u2019t pull it out of thin air.\n\nAnyway my friend decided he wanted to start purging a lot of his collection of these toys he\u2019s had since he was a kid. We took this as a good sign like he wanted to make some changes and grow as a person. But in hindsight I have no idea what was going through his head.\n\nDuring this time, I had offered to buy his Pok\u00e9mon cards off him. (I think I asked, unless HE asked but i\u2019d be surprised if he did) This was like 8-10 years ago and I had no idea what the collection was worth. I was just trying to expand my own collection. Hoping they\u2019d be worth something some day.\n\nHe sold me his entire collection for $40 which we both must\u2019ve known was a great deal. I didn\u2019t push him to and he explicitly said he didn\u2019t care. It seemed like he was happy to sell them to me.\n\nWell that night I combined most of the cards with my own collection. Excited to fill out some holes in my sets as well as get a bunch of cool Japanese cards.\n\nNot sure when, possibly the next day or couple days he texted me asking if he could buy them back\u2026\u2026. \nI basically said sorry I already combined them in with my own collection and it would be too difficult to separate them accurately to give them back\u2026 in reality we could\u2019ve figured it out. There were a ton I didn\u2019t combine and I could\u2019ve recalled a lot that I did. I just really didn\u2019t wanna give them back, that would\u2019ve been and still would be a huge bummer for me.\nI understand this makes me selfish. And if you look at the cards now\u2026. Their value went through the roof. I still work with this friend and I never want to bring up Pok\u00e9mon cards. \nHe has, imo, spiraled even more it seems and we aren\u2019t really friends, just coworkers at this point.\nSo now I feel guilty but I\u2019m happy my collection is worth a lot \ud83d\ude2c",

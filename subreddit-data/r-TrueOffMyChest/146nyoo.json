    "postText": "When I was 16, I had a group of friends who would hang out together during school, and branch off to hang out in smaller clusters after school. We were typical teenagers, drinking on the weekends, staying out too late, just too cool, the works. Being 16 in the digital age, sometimes we did stupid shit online. Posting dumb YouTube videos or in-poor-taste Facebook posts. Nothing terrible, no cyber bullying or dark web stuff, just typical 2010s behavior. \n\nOne weekend one of my friends in this group, we will call him A, photoshopped the public media photos of a few girls in our class \"suggestively\". I say suggestive with air quotes because they were completely passable photos, except that he would add a boob over their shirt or something. I don't know exactly why he did this, but he shared it with his guy friends in th group for a laugh. One of the girls in the photos, we will call B.\n\nI don't know who, but someone sent the altered photo to B, and she immediately went on a slander campaign. The school board, and the cops got involved. B told anyone who would listen that A was a predator and should never be allowed near children or women again. Anyone associated with A was slandered and put on blast by B and her backup. The pressure got too much for A's girlfriend, and she eventually left. A stopped coming to school. Myself and a few other female friends started a \"support group\" of sorts, and tried to convince him to come back to school, that mistakes happen and we knew he wasn't dangerous, but any attempts at positivity were ultimately drowned out by the onslaught of relentless slander and harassment. \n\nA eventually started bringing up suicide. That he had a plan. That he didn't want to be around. That he could fix everything. \n\nEvery time it was mentioned, I sent the police to his house. I didn't know his parents number, or I would've contacted them too. I sent them to his house so many times, I had to start sending screenshots to another girl in my class who's mum worked at the local station because they no longer believed me. \n\nI sent the police to his house 84 times over an 8 month period. \n\nThe last time he hung out with me, it was February. He had cut his hair, and only wore a hood up. We walked on the thick ice of a small pond near our town. We talked for over an hour, hugged, and I said I'd see him next time.\n\nThe next month he started again with the suicide hints. I was going through a break up, my parents were divorcing, and I had too much on my plate this time. I couldn't handle it. For the first time in over a year, I told him to knock it off. I told him it would fizzle out. I said that some of those girls were mad because he had embarrassed them and he just had to own up to it. I said he was making a liar out of me, and I couldn't just keep sending the cops to his house. Nobody believed be anymore and it was time to own up to what he did, apologize, and let this finish its course. He thanked me for my opinion, and went to bed. \n\nThe next morning, I go into school and sit in homeroom. The teacher is late. 10 minutes late, then 15 minutes late. An emergency meeting is called over the loud speakers, and my heart dropped to my feet. I've never left a classroom so fast. I was something of a teachers pet to my woodshop teacher, and I ran into him on his way to the office. I just stared at him, and he knew. He knew that A and I were friends, and as stupid as it may sound, I trusted my shop teacher not to lie to me. I just asked very slowly, \"did A..\" and my shop teacher nodded as sympathetically as he could manage. \n\nI don't remember too much after that, not immediately at least, but the hate I got in the following weeks was massive. In my teenage grief i had sent a few of my friends A and I's final conversation. B twisted it into a story about how I had convinced him to kill himself, and spread that story for 3 more years to anyone who would listen until I graduated. I was put on blast for 'not taking suicide seriously enough', or turning my back on someone who needed me. I lost everyone. A lost everything. \n\nI still text him to this day, updates about my life and milestones we should have shared. Chritmas and birthdays, graduations and updates about how much things have changed over the years. I send him my guilt and apologies, I send him all of it, with some kind of twisted hope that one day he might respond.",

The teachers should have controlled the smear campaign and not let it get out of hand. Counsellors should have mediated and intervened and the police officials should have maybe approached the parents regarding their child's troubles mentality.\nThe adults and the system failed a troubled teenager.\n\nNowhere did I read that you were disloyal or were a bad friend. You went above and beyond and did everything you could to save your friend.\n\nI am glad you have been able to move on in life and hopefully are in therapy. \n\nI did not wish ill upon B till when she was a victim of a prank of a sexual nature perpetuated by your friend - She was right to be offended but maybe she went too far. I did feel enraged on how she started another smear campaign by blaming the death of your friend on you. \n\nKarma may be slow but it still will catch up on B.",

But I doubt that comment came out of nowhere. \n\nThe OP talked about how they liked to do \u201cin poor taste\u201d posts online but nothing that was cyber bullying except that is actually what this was. Makes me wonder how far those other \u201cin poor taste\u201d posts went.  I think the OP is downplaying the way him and his friend group conducted themselves. You don\u2019t start a story by saying I didn\u2019t engage in cyber bullying unless you did something approaching cyber bullying.",

B was not targeted specifically, and these were never meant to spread beyond the people they were sent to. Eventually each photoshopped photo was returned to the girl in said photo, a total of 20+ girls (again, including me). B is the only one of those girls to participate in the slander campaign",

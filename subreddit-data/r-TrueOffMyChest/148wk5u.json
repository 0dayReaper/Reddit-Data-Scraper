    "postText": "For starters I am adopted. It's relevant information to know because they never treat their other children like they do me. Of course I went to the same school as them but I never had any of their privileges. They always took them to their vacations and trips and I stayed behind coz \"someone has to look after the estate\" which is BS because they have almost six live in staff. I wear hand me downs from the eldest or from my mother. Meanwhile everyone else is given a lumpsome of money to go just clothes shopping. I only get that privilege when I accompany one of them. \n\nIt's such a confusing feeling to be in a private boarding school but not be able to afford the extra stuff while your siblings have no problem with that. I got into their avaition program based on merit and thought maybe I could join their flight school after I graduate. Only to be told that they can't possibly invest that much money on me, that I need to \"earn my place in the world\" . The eldest daughter is on a gap year in south Africa for fun which they fully fund her pretentious luxurious lifestyle. \n\nI got into a public university fully funded by the government again on merit and lived for the majority of it on the 'normal people dorms'(not my words). My mum only seemed to care when one of her friends asked her why I'm not in the premium rooms with her daughter (she's my best friend) the next day I got transferred. \n\nThey treat me like a trophy. And object they can easily cast aside when there's no one to impress. I have watched my parents buy shit worth more than my college tuition in one sitting with the excuse of, 'you got to spoil yourself once in a while'. \n\nI know this all sounds like a spoilt brat. But been surrounded by wealth only to realize that you will never be good enough to be allowed to take part in is a very damning experience.\n\nI have seen people who look like me who were adopted into these rich familys have a much better experience and it seems like I am alone in this. \n\nI don't know where I came from or what motivated my biological parents to give me up, but I would have much rather preferred to belong and fit in, I would fought everyday for them if I had the chance. Coz this life I have right now, is so dehumanizing sometimes. Like I don't deserve anything unless I bend over backwards and pray blood only to receive a miniscule and then having to watch other receive a full platter for just existing. \n\nAnyways, I'll leave this family one day. After I graduate, I'll take my degree and bit up van that I bought with my own money, and never come back to this fucked up place. \n\nBtw every other sibling of mine was bought a car when they turned sixteen. I'm turning 21 and have never gotten a birthcake or any other kind of acknowledgement since I was 6. \n\nIdk maybe it's just me.",

            "comment": "You'd be justified in cutting them off tbh.\n\nYou're a trophy child to show people how *charitable* and *kind hearted* they are.\n\nYou're turning 21, so why not just go do your own thing. They won't approve or care anywa, do what you want.\n\nStop showing up for holidays and parties. Deprive them of the privilege of showing you off. Let them squirm as they get the side eye from their peers who all wonder why their adoptive son cut them off and never returned. Remind them that this is the one thing you have that they want to fuel their narcissism.\n\nYou won't get love from sociopathic, affluent people but you can make them pay for your presence lmao. Force them to hire you as their son for holidays.\n\nIf you're not the revenge type, quietly disappear without a word and use your aviation connections to move. They could help you get a passport, then you start over in a foreign country similar to your own where most private investigators won't be able to find you",

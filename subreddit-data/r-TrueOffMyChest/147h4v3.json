    "postText": "I (17m) and my gf (17f) have been together for only 6 months. These past 6 months have been a wild adventure and the most emotional 6 months I've ever experienced. We met from mutual friends and hit it off immediatley. We very much enjoy each other's company and have many things in common. To her, I'm the man she's ever wanted and to me, she's the woman I've always wanted. Anyways, the reason our relationship was toxic was because of her emotional manipulation. She played the victim and gaslights me into thinking I'm in the wrong. Me being in my first relationship and thinking this is normal apologizes until after talking with family for advice and they were on my side. An example of an argument would be something very trivial that could've been solved in 1 minute but escalated over a few days. She was still in contact with her exes and I told her that it made me uncomfortable that she's still in contact and told her to block them and she refused heavily. I thought I was in the wrong for forcing her to do something she didn't want to until I realized she was overstepping a boundary that we put and so after going off on her, she admitted to being wrong. However, she played overreacted and started feeling extremely bad because of what she did and I had to assure her that it's a minor mistake. She also kept defending her best friend cheating on my friend which I couldn't change her mind about and didn't tell my friend because I was scared she would leave me because she said that if I said anything and her friendship with her friend is broken, we would break up. Her reasoning is because it's \"none of our business\" even though I care for my friend but she's being selfish and putting her friend who is CHEATING first. Others have told me to break up after knowing that but I still hesitated. One incident where I would be in the wrong would be when she went on my account and brought up that I unfollowed a guy that was following her because of my own fear of being cheated on. It's no excuse but we made amends the next day with the promise of me never doing anything of the sort again. Our main problem is communication and it was really bad to the point she would ghost me for hours on end and only take her anger and frustration on me as well. I've seen her with her friends and family and she acts like nothing happened but with me, she's mad even though I did absolutely nothing. I would say that she has mental health problems that never fully went away which I respect and don't want to blame it on that but it does play a part later. After we had sex for the first time, she ghosted me again for some reason and started saying things like \"we should break up\" and stuff. I was shocked and called her and she was all giggly and joyful while saying all this which got me infuriated and eventually hung up. She then went on to apologize and say that she's sorry for all the things she's done and realized she's always been in the wrong and always took advantage of me and my kindness without knowing and never took me seriously. She also said the reason why she was saying that stuff was because she thought after we had sex that I would leave her and brag to everyone that I finally hit. I assured her I would never do that and she has nothing to worry about. We met a few days later with an ultimatum that we would take a break to focus on ourselves and fix our problems and she was in shock. I put my foot down for once and we agreed. She cried for days and I was being petty. Extremely petty. I wanted to do to her what she did to me. For a week, I purposely ghosted her, dry texted, and other things she's done because I thought she deserved and so did she. According to her, she said that she's completely fine and she has changed, in the time of 3 days. I didn't believe it because I thought she was trying to get me to get back with her. We went out a week after and she was tired of it. She said she would rather be with anyone else at that moment. She later explained that she changed and yet I was still purposely being petty toward her and proved that I haven't changed. I apologized and agreed that if she can trust me at that moment, we'll be together again. The reason why we were hesitant was because of my fear of being manipulated and her fear of being heartbroken. We promised we would never do that again and she agreed and we were back to normal. Since the break, she has changed and has improved on many things. Our communication was better and our bond was closer. We also had the cheating friend break up with my friend but they have a friends with benefits situation going on so we gave up on them at that point. It was until yesterday that we were texting and while she was at work and I was at the gym, she wanted pictures of me at the gym flexing and stuff. I did but the way she was saying it made me a bit uncomfortable but I was going to do it regardless if she told me to or not because it's fun. Later, we were texting and joking around. We were talking about what we'll do next week and I said to get some food that we both were craving but she was going to get it that day without me. So I said in return we'll do some \"stuff\" next week in a joking way. I took the \"joke\" too far and I said to send a picture of her butt instead. That killed the mood as she really doesn't like it when a guy tells her to send pictures like that. I crossed a boundary I shouldn't have and I regret it a lot. She told me she doesn't forgive me and that other guys in the past have said to send pics like that and afterward say it was a \"joke.\" She now doesn't want to talk to me until she can bring herself to talk again. I've been extremely anxious since then as she said that she thought that I changed since the break but she was proven wrong. I really think she is going to be disgusted by me now as she thinks I'm like the other guys and she thought I was respectful. I've told her and assured her that I'm not like the rest but the rest have said that exact thing and I have no way to prove that I'm being truthful. I really regret saying that \"joke\" and I believe I deserve whatever judgment is put upon me. She went to a friend's party today and I had no knowledge of it. I don't know what she did as she didn't advise me about it at all before and she also had work today that she didn't call off from what I know. I saw her schedule so I'm very sure she did work today. I'm just very paranoid and anxious about what would happen and I feel like it's all my fault and I'm a monster for saying that. That puts an end to our toxic relationship so far I'll update soon. ",

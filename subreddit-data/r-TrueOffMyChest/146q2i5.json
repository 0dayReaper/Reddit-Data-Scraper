I don't actually get too many tall comments, so I'm assuming you're at least several inches taller than I am. \n\nNgl, when random strangers see me pass in the grocery store and pull me over to ask for help reaching for an item on the top shelf, I feel like I have a super power though. But I definitely don't get \"wow, you're tall!\" comments...ever. \n\nThe only thing I hate about being tall is trying to find shoes! Payless used to be my go-to for inexpensive shoes (I'm size 13) but then they went out of business and I would say 90% of the shoes stores in my area end at size 10 or 11 for women, and a select few end at 12. There are no stores that carry size 13 anymore and I definitely am a \"try before you buy\" kinda shopper so I hate shopping online. \n\nAnd online stores for shoes? Ugh. I do NOT want to pay $75 for a pair of sandals! I'm so frustrated. \n\nI haven't bought a new pair of shoes in about 4 years now and all my old women's shoes are wearing out....\ud83d\ude22\n\nEdit: seems like I'm definitely the minority about no one mentioning my height. I grew up in SoCal and never really heard it there except when I was a teen (I reached 6ft when I was 14). Then I enlisted in the military and have now permanently found myself in South Carolina and no one here mentions it either. \ud83e\udd37 Maybe I just live in a special part of the country that doesn't mention height? Lol. Or I've just been lucky. I'm 34 now and...crickets about my height for the past 15 years probably.",

A surprising one for me is Marcella NYC.  No talls but their tops are long and well made.  But if you need sleeve length in talls for sweaters: ASOS, Banana Republic, Madewell, J Crew.  Never had luck with Old Navy tall tops but love their tall jeans. \n\nBest shoe brands that have 12: I swear by Sorels (boots and sandals).  Love them.   But also love J Crew pumps, Nike gym shoes, Cariuma for those low white tennis shoes, Sam Edelman (sometimes Clarks, but they can look less stylish) for dress shoes, and Berkenstocks.\n\nBest bathing suits:  I still rock a bikini even at 42 bc who cares?  We need to love our aging bodies.  \n\nBut I did recently find in the past 3 years, Andie's swim has awesome long torso bathing suits worth every penny!!  I  have a bikini from them as well.  Great quality. \n\nHere are the two I have that I REALLY recommend:\nhttps://andieswim.com/products/the-malibu-one-piece-eco-nylon-splash-classic\nhttps://andieswim.com/products/the-mykonos-flat-cherry-red-classic",

    "postText": "Yes I know this question is weird, but my extended family has been insisting to me that my childhood was fantastic (unwarranted, I never complained) on repeat, like clockwork. so I want other opinions.\r  \n\r  \nPlease don't answer \"wElL dId yOU fEeL iT wAs TrAuMatiC?\" I don't give a fuck about how I feel. I want to know about how an objective person should feel. Also I live away from my family now.\r  \n\r  \nI don't wanna mislead any1 or be melodramatic so if u have any qs pls ask\r  \n\r  \nMoney: I grew up wealthy. But at the same time, I had to forgo basic needs. Like if I was rly thirsty and we were driving... too bad. However, my parents are also very logistically helpful in terms of my goals and helping me get my shit in order, which is nice.\r  \n\r  \nParent Relationship: They're friends, I guess? But one of my parents has almost died multiple times from different health issues. This parent also compulsively cheats on the other parent. They've both been deeply suicidal at different times. My mother's mental health is garbage. She would have weird spurts of anger and would throw shit at me, scream at me, or hit me with her purse. Or she'd ignore me. I couldn't predict what would set her off.\r  \n\r  \nSexualization: I was/am sexualized pretty badly. There are no boundaries. My dad would walk in the bathroom when I'm in the shower and chat with me. My mom would randomly touch my butt. My dad's friends also want to have sex w/ me and he wants me to look nice for them when they come over. I was also molested by a relative. That kind of sucked lol. It wasn't violent, there was almost no age gap, but I was really close to them so that wasn't great.\r  \n\r  \nOld men were also regularly extremely predatory to me (try to give me alc when I was 11, follow me, try to get in car I was parked in, groped me). When I got catcalled when I was 10-12 my parents were really happy because I was \"beautiful.\" My parents will call me names if I don't let them touch me or hold my hand. When I was going through a promiscuous phase my parents also took my phone and made fun of how many guys were messaging me\r  \n\r  \nOther Traumatic Events: I was sexually assaulted in hs and my mom found out, and got very mad at me. The police kinda made fun of me lol. In high school I definitely wanted to kms. In college I got assaulted a stupid amount of times by a stupid amount of people. I honestly stopped trying to count/analyze it. I'm not going to say it was my fault but I picked horrible people because I felt comfortable with themI dated a really horrifically abusive guy.\r  \n\r  \nSchool: I have ADHD and was constantly berated by my teachers. I was also in a competitive sport, and my family bragged about me compulsively. I was so exhausted I felt like I was constantly about to have a psychotic break. My coach was also very groomy lol. My other coach is now in jail for touching my teammate. I also didn't really have any good friends in my childhood, except one that I still have today. The rest of my \"friends\" were very mean to me and I felt happy just to be included. A lot of my classmates sexually harassed me pretty badly. A group of 3-4 guys would try to touch me or make comments on my body in class every other day, and I was called \"jailbait.\" In general, teachers had an inappropriate amount of beef with me and would go out of their way to humiliate me.\r  \n\r  \nExtended Family/health: The family has a lot of suicides, drug/alcohol abuse, and general mental health issues. My parents regularly denied me medical care, like hearing aids, dental care, birth control, or mental health care, even though they have the same mental health issues.\r  \n\r  \nI'm close with some of my gparents, but they have issues (get jealous of me, grandfather is severely emotionally stunted (can't express basic kindness to other people). My molester regularly tried to exclude me at family events, and then other relatives excluded me a lot too. I'm not gonna say all bc thats melodramatic but ya",

My parents were also mentally unstable especially my father, he was an alcoholic and violent towards my mom and my  sister. \n\n\nFrom what you wrote, it\u2019s sounds like you went through some serious trauma and it obviously has taken a toll on you. \n\nAgain, I\u2019m very sorry you experienced everything you\u2019ve written.\n\nYour parents should\u2019ve stood up for you, but they didn\u2019t.\n\nGlad you decided to write this, and whatever form of therapy you have access to, please utilize it. \n\nThe memories can become overwhelming. So please do your best. Much respect to you, fellow human.",

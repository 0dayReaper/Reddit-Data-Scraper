We are being fed bullshit through official channels (news like \"73% of people support decision about republics and operation\", BUT its a fully owned governmental source, so its most likely to be false). Furthermore, I've yet to see a conscious human being support movements happening now. It's so sad and depressing, since we as a province people can't do shit. People in Moscow and Saint Petersburg are getting arrested for protesting against war, chunk of people are scared for their well-being, job, education and try to stay low profile. It's just fucking depressing, I wasn't against my country, but having a possibility to get weaponized and be on agressor side against another slavic nation is just incomprehensible for me.\n\nupd: what's more, people are people and its really sad to see Ukrain in such condition. I have friends there and I just feel fucking guilty even while trying to contact them to ask how are they or help them somehow because they can blame me for what is happening, just because I'm on the other side and not for ideas that I have",

How if it weren\u2019t for the internet Putin wouldn\u2019t have nearly as much access to plant propaganda directly into the brains of Western citizens. We used to have a far more consolidated news media, with a handful of independent yet trusted sources passing on only verified information. If it didn\u2019t come from one of these sources, then maybe it didn\u2019t really happen. Nobody sane believed what they read in the National Enquirer but the New York Times was a \u201cpaper of record\u201d. Sure there was always the potential for information suppression under the old system, but we also had a strong tradition of independent investigative reporters, both local and national, unearthing secrets those in power would prefer to keep hidden. And their reports were vetted and transmitted through the trusted sources, allowing people to easily know that what they heard and read was very likely true whether they liked it or not. \n\nThese trusted news sources easily filtered out Russian propaganda, or exposed it as such. But now that the majority of people no longer receive their news from these sources, rather from an endless stream of internet media of questionable veracity, it is up to them alone  to decide what to trust, what to filter out or not, and most of us are woefully ill-equipped for that task. Putin and his oligarchs have exploited this newfound weakness in Western society most of all, using the internet to seed once-unthinkable ideas directly into the minds of citizens. He has managed to separe the UK from the EU, get fucking Donald Trump elected US president, and convert a good chunk of Western citizens into Russia-loving democracy-hating radicals who would rather see their own nation burn than see Putin held to account. \n\nAs someone who grew up during the Cold War, the depth and degree to which Russia has infiltrated the thinking of millions of Americans utterly shocks and deeply terrifies me. We have been massively weakened as a nation, our collectiveness and cohesiveness decimated, our people divided and radically disinformed, and many turned into gleeful traitors. And it has all been enabled by this technological \u201cmiracle\u201d called the internet. When the world looks back on this time in US history, I have a feeling some will term it a \u201csoft invasion\u201d of the West by Russia, where they used the untamed internet to take over the minds of citizens and get them to destroy their own democracies from within without Russia ever firing a shot.",

I have always understood Bogoraz\u2019s note to be an expression of shame\u2014the helpless, silent shame of a citizen who can do nothing to stop her country\u2019s aggression.

Yes, there is a certain extent to which governments manufacture consent for this shit. \n\nYes, there is nationalism, yes there is xenophobia, and they basically make efforts to make these things seem as if they're the logical responses to what's going on. Of course, these things are invariably a smokescreen to cover up what they're really doing, to justify the injustices of the systems they create.\n\nBut the main thing is that they offer nationalism or they offer liberalism. But they don't offer anything else. Either you go for the form of capitalism that excludes you, but really explicitly moves against anyone who isn't like you, or you go for the one that says that everyone's equal in theory as long as it doesn't involve money changing hands. Where do we have the kinds of democracy where else is possible?",

I don\u2019t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other\u2019s happiness - not by each other\u2019s misery. We don\u2019t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.\nGreed has poisoned men\u2019s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost\u2026\nThe aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people\"",

Putin is the focal point of oligarchic power in Russia, not the power in itself. There are several other big players that would have to be taken out to truly free Russia, and most people don't even know their names. The only one I can remember offhand is the one that appears to have opened an aluminum plant in Kentucky in exchange for McConnel helping get him off the sanctions lists: Oleg Deripaska.",

The worst was \u201ctraitor\u201d and \u201cterrorist sympathizer\u201d and their refusal to call us Americans or fellow citizens.\n\nThis is the complexity of America. The jingoistic racist fucks pushing this shit are safely tucked away from any repercussions of their behavior while they push all of the rest of us around. My family is African American and have felt the worst from our fellow citizens. It\u2019s age old. Plenty of civil rights leaders were smeared because of their ant-war stances. (Insert Ali\u2019s quote about the Vietnamese never calling him the N word). I\u2019m sorry you got a taste of it but thank you for sticking with the voiceless Americans who really tried (and continue to try).",

But ill try: a lot of Russians feel like \"the west\" danced on their grave, so to speak, after the fall of Soviet Union. Promises broken, \"end of history\" etc. They don't want communism again, but want the prestige and respect of the Soviet Union. They are a nation with a 1000 year history, and were the the preeminent land power in Europe, and wish to be seen that way again. Right or wrong, its in the Russian psyche. This, of course, is more the sentiment of the older generation. Young people, anyone under 30 really, has a very different mindset, because they grew up in a very different Russia.",

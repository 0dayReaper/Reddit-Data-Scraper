    "postText": "I don't know if I can post this hear. Before we begin, I put \"NSFW\" since it deals with some sensitive issues. I didn't want to break the rules. Anyways onwards...\n\n\nTo be honest, I thought I was doing better in life. Like not with materials, wealth, etc. Just mental issues I guess. I don't feel happy much anymore. I felt so good during my mini vacation, yet once again no matter how happy I get, life finds a way to take it away from me. \n\nNo one wants to listen to me, no one cares if I feel sad. What's the point. I don't complain about my life to others, I don't talk depressive like to anyone. I tend to keep that too myself, cause no one wants to hear it. \n\nAll I hear is \"People have it worse than you\", I'm just numb from it. But my problems and suicide tendencies are \"not as worse\" as others. People love to set me up with them wanting me to be honest, then suddenly shut me down as \"your life is not as worse off than others\". \n\nSo what's the point. No one would miss me, all my \"friends\" and some \"family\" abandoned me back 2010 when I was in the hospital after a car accident, which everyone blames me to this day. And say \"I did it on purpose\". No one cared or missed me when I was locked in a house on a couch bed unable to walk as my parents couldn't take care of me cause they had to work. \n\nNo one cared then, no one would care now. No matter what I do, no one wants to do anything with me or even visit me in my apartment. I try hosting a party, and no one cared to come..I invited some co-workers thinking to make new friends and nothing. \n\n\n\nI made sure throughout my life, that people close to me had food, gas, housing, money, etc. I also helped my family take care of others. I guess I  was meant to be alone, meant to have no happiness. \n\nThanks for listening/reading....",

I\u2019m sure you are capable to take care of yourself, and I would focus more on self-love now. It\u2019s ok if people around you don\u2019t care about/ love you, but you need to love yourself. \n\nComparison isn\u2019t fair, I\u2019ll choose to ignore those who say \u201cothers have it worse\u201d. It\u2019s a never ending cycle.",

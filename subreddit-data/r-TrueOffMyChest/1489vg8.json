Every time I\u2019m about to I just wake back up because what if I don\u2019t wake up anymore? My boyfriend is sleeping right next to me and he looks so comfy, I want to sleep like that but I just can\u2019t. I mean I won\u2019t even know if I don\u2019t wake up but my daughter will. I feel so dumb for even feeling this way. It\u2019s just sleep, I know I need it. I just can\u2019t",

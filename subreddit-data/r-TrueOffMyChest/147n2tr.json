    "postText": "It's kind of long, some parts lack transition but that shouldn't matter too much.  \nAnyway, here we go :\r  \n\r\r\r  \nBecause of the solitude and the intensity of emotions felt through my constant relationship with various artistic objects, I feel hatred towards trivialities and most of what happens between human beings, at least the ones I'm surrounded by.\r  \nEvery family and social gathering exhausts me and I have to get through up to 48 hours of aimless wandering and mind spiraling to get back to my activities and stop thinking about how alienating was the social gathering.\r  \n\r  \nI've never been able to fulfill the intensity of my overly sentimental and romantic side.\r  \nBetween the age of 16 and 19, I've had a few occasions to flirt, kiss and have sex with people, but it always ended up in a mutual embarrassment. I can and I like to flirt (at least I used to in those years where I was less \"self-aware\") but you just can't get physical touch and sex out of me. Despite immensely desiring physical contact, I'm getting paralyzed. As soon as something like this presents itself, I feel like I'm out of my body watching myself from above having to perform mechanical movements.\r  \n\r  \nI'm in a constant state of attraction / repulsion towards acts of love. They feel deeply unnatural to me (especially the kissing part) and during physical engagement, I couldn't even conceive of moving my pelvis to perform a specific part of the sexual act. I feel reduced to being an animal fulfilling a desire that's not mine.\r  \n\r  \nI've searched answers and thought that my inability to tolerate or practice physical touch without spiraling down might come from childhood. I was diagnosed as a precocious, hyperactive, hypersensitive, (and maybe depressive) child with ADHD (the whole usual package, that I happen to still carry) which made parenting very hard. Love and physical touch were scarce, and as the normative capitalist school tries to suppress individualities and says there's something wrong with some children, my exploited, unknowing and conformist parents were basically clueless about me during childhood.\r  \n\r  \nI carry multiple paradoxes. I know there's a great deal of vitality in myself (sorry for the self indulgent next paragraph). I used to be an entertaining and fun person during childhood, always been the best at that in the room or classroom. I'm great at doing voices, I'm witty, dark humored and I'm a good fucking dancer while no one's watching (which paradoxically shows that I can be comfortable with my body).\r  \nDespite my constant self hatred, I'm actually able to pity myself and think \"What a waste. You happen to be in the beauty standards. That's one barrier down. And since you're so insecure, you've never stopped exercising and you're in good shape, so that's another barrier down. That half dozen flirts you never initiated speak for themselves.\"\r  \nBut I'm somehow being entirely shut down by I don't really know what.\r  \n\r  \nI'm now nearly 29yo. Years have passed and nothing happened romantically since I was 20. I left school, there has been only work, solitary leisure and suffering. I believe that since I did not experience candid teenage years romantic relationships, I'm (partially) stuck desiring those and it's not healthy.\r  \nI'm not desiring being myself now and having candid relationships with teenagers (oof), but desiring being a teenager and having candid relationships.\r  \nI am absolutely sure that when I'll be 40, I'll still desire from afar people between 16 and 25yo because of the feel of having missed a period of my life. And I say again, this is not healthy.\r  \nDo I simply wish I hadn't left innocent life ?\r  \n\r  \nI thought for a long time that I could overcome my idiosyncrasy keeping me from engaging in physical experiences with people and that solitude was the way I could live my most intense life, but the frustration never got away for very long.\r  \nSolitude often causes me to turn on a dating app \"just in case\" and it always leaves me in a worst state than the one in which I turned it on. I see all of these persons and individualities and I take the full blow of what I'm missing and how much I want to engage with dozens and dozens of people. I can't overcome being such a slave to beauty and giving arbitrary amounts of desire and empathy to people solely based on their looks, interests and what I perceive them to be through their pictures and profiles. I can't produce a single sentence and try to engage because I'll have not to be myself for a few seconds. I feel I have a huge problem with how absurd flirting is.\r  \n\r  \nI've always been the opposite of a solipsist. For the better and the worst, I've always been very mindful that a (more or less) self-aware individual lies in every body and might experience intense emotions, sensations and questionning.\r  \n\r  \nI become excessively melancholic by my (or our) incapacity to truly connect with others, and because I'm incapable of enjoying a moment without being in the constant state of mourning the moment or a relationship that's not even finished or started.\r  \n7 years ago, I spent probably 2 years unhealthily focusing on a person every morning in public transportation just because of their looks and the personnality they were radiating, until they stopped taking transport.\r  \nI've never been able to say a word.\r  \nAfter all these years, a few weeks ago, I happened to saw this person working in a grocery store.\r  \nI was still very much seduced, and I still didn't say a word.\r  \nI now shop every friday around 12:30AM because I know they're here and the queue is empty at this hour, and I still don't say a word.\r  \n\r  \nI carry an insurmountable paradox where I catch some kind of Nausea if I witness a behavior of love towards me from a person I don't care about.\r  \nLike my family, unfortunately.\r  \nLike my mother sending me a sunset picture, unfortunately.\r  \nI know what lies behind this sent picture and the love text that comes with it, trying to communicate a strong sensory experience. The very same thing I want to experience but with people I actually love.\r  \n\r  \nI maintained a very precious online relationship with a person for 5 years (practically the only person I regularly talked to for years). We've seen each other in real life a few times towards the end. Every fucking time, I became socially akward and turned into a submissive state in fear of saying or doing anything that might discomfort this person that I valued so much, while also anticipating the moment where I'd have to leave.\r  \nI was so unaccustomed to enjoyable social activities and new environments that I was hurting at the idea that I would hurt in a few hours or days when it would be over.\r  \nLast time we saw each other, this person was about to change continents for good and was getting rid of most of their possessions. I believe my \"grief\", my weird behavior and their complicated change of life practically ended our friendship which I have to say, had been very consistent and enriching.\r  \n\r  \nI remember leaving a play (Shakespeare's \\*As You Like it\\* if that matters) in a very melancholic state caused by the joy and vitality of its non-professional young adults actors.\r  \nIt hurt so fucking much to see people jump, play, sing and be at ease with themselves and their bodies while being stuck in my hampered mind that allows none of that.\r  \nIt also hurts to see [people smiling and dancing carefreely](https://youtu.be/yMEqgn8i2xs?t=6186) because for me it constitutes peak vitality, sexual desirability and happiness. Things that I feel kept from.\r  \nThere's no limit to the romantic and erotic stimulation I get from watching some of those people dancing.\r  \nRegarding paradoxes and because of the hurting, I can revert back in a split second to my authoritatian core and consider those carefree attitudes to be the most ridicule and \"unself-aware\" behaviors.\r  \n\r  \nI believe that individuals \"deserve\" to be surrounded and stimulated according to their needs. Living beings need to live with their peers for their well being.\r  \nMy family's minds have been completely washed out by a life of work orchestrated by capitalism. I just can't get anything out of them. They're barely interested in anything and don't have much to say except for stories that happened at work. I still feel distant empathy because I know their life have been mostly stolen from them and I consider them lost forever. You don't reverse a mindset like theirs. Regarding their couple relationships, my mom just dumps her workday on my father like my grandpa dumps what happened in the evening soccer match on my grandma even though she never had any interest in soccer in 50 years. Those are such morbid relationships.\r  \n\r  \nI sometimes listen to artists and intellectuals that I look up to talking about their friendships and I realize I have never lived anything close to the intensity they talk about, except for that 5 years long friendship that was very fulfilling.\r  \nI feel stupid reducing relationships to a simple case of \"are we able to talk about something else than the fucking weather, the boring things that happened during work that you don't realize are embarrassing your audience, or the last TV show that Prime or Netflix just put online\", but I have to accept that this is basically my reality.\r  \n\r  \nI have the shameful secret desire to have my whole family die because of how much I feel alienated by their very existence. The obligation to regularly engage with them, at least once a month for parents and twice a year for more distant relatives is still too much.\r  \nThe only other social gatherings I attend are card games with young adults men that mostly have the same lack of romantic life as mine and tend to let their frustrations get into the games we're playing, which leads to real \"manchildren\" moments that slowly pushed me out of those gatherings, in addition to my growing hatred for those games that I deep down consider to be wasted time.\r  \n\r  \nI feel trapped by my condescending indulgence that more or less knows (or thinks knowing) what lies behind every behavior that my relatives have but I know my mediocrity too well not to spot the one of others. I need to be in the company of somebody that I can't decipher in 30 seconds.\r  \n\r  \nSo, was I born in the wrong place ? All I've ever known was lower or middle-class people, and despite being fully aware of what causes them to be how they are and what's being done to them, I just dont enjoy their company. I resent the irrational and filial love of my family.\r  \n\r  \nIs it a simple case of not being surrounded by the right people with who balanced and mutually profitable relationships could form ? I know a few people online with who I have lots of common interests and for whom I feel immense amounts of sympathy and even irrational love if I happen to be physically attracted to them.\r  \n\r  \nDo I actually not like individualities since I'm mostly interested in people close to myself ?\r  \n\r  \nAm I just projecting the personnality I'd like to fall in love with on random people in the street or in the shadows of a dancefloor ?\r  \n\r  \nDo I just want to fall in love with myself but from the opposite sex ?\r  \n\r  \nAm I just being an unsufferable asshole who can't accept the triviality of life ?\r  \n\r  \nAm I an incurable idealist ? Is reality not good enough for me ?\r  \n\r  \nIs it a matter of eternal dissatisfaction and lack of transcendance ?\r  \n\r  \nHave I had my judgment clouded all my life because of a constant state of depression ?\r  \n\r  \nIs getting paralyzed when it's time to engage into physical contact a delayed reaction towards the absurd of attraction between people ?\r  \n\r  \nI live in a constant state of strong nostalgia and melancholia, those have been my fuel since I entered \"conscious\" life around 19yo.\r  \nI'm conscious at every fucking moment of all the things and experiences I'm missing and about the death that awaits. I'm bound to this very narrow 21th century french man existence that I'm not remotely living at its fullest. The solitude and melancholia that keeps adding up because of all the memories (and god I wish I could not remember everything like I do) will reach a threshold of unbearability like it almost did many times already.\r  \n\r  \nPessoa said (in my own aproximate translation): \"I feel like I've missed the singularity of love, the same way I've missed the globality of life. The fear of hurting others, the acute awareness of others' existences, those things have stunned my life.\"\r  \n\r  \nSteinbeck also wrote: \"A boy gets to be a man when a man is needed. Remember this thing. I have known boys forty years old because there was no need for a man.\"\r  \n\r  \nMight I still simply be a boy ?",

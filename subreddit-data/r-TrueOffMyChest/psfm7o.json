    "postText": "My mom was 11 years old when her older brother's sexual abuse of her got her pregnant. Her parents covered up the abuse, forcing her to lie and say she'd been fooling around with a boy in her class. They hid her away from the public eye and shamed her for being pregnant. She begged to be allowed to abort me, but her parents denied her access to an abortion. \n\nChildbirth left her disabled: to this day she has chronic pain in her hips and walks with a cane. Her parents adopted me and raised me as their own, believing my mother and father were my older siblings. My mother was sent to a boarding school, but on break she was forced to live in the same household as her abuser and the product of that abuse until she left home at 18.\n\nI found out the truth a year ago, when I turned 18. Suddenly a lot of things started to make sense: why my \"sister\" could barely look at me when I was growing up, why she barely had any contact with the family after she left home, why it always felt like something was off about my family and the way they saw me. I'd always felt like they were embarrassed of me, but I'd never known why.\n\nI am the kind of person pro-lifers claim to protect. While my mom wasn't prevented from abortion by law, the outcome is the same. I, and many other babies, was born to an unwilling and deeply traumatized young mother. I was born a reminder of abuse, a shameful family secret. When an unwanted pregnancy occurs after abuse, this is the outcome many pro-lifers hope for, this is the outcome the Texas heartbeat bill intends to enforce.\n\nI'm one of the lucky ones. I found out at 18, when I had the capacity to process it. My mom sought mental health care in her adulthood and we've developed a positive relationship in the last year. I wasn't raised by a resentful mother, bounced between begrudging family members, or put in foster care. Many children born in similar circumstances grow up abused, openly resented, and traumatized. \n\nMy life is fine, and my mom's life is fine despite everything she went through. But if I could go back in time and somehow change her parents' minds, I would do so in a heartbeat. **No one should ever be forced to endure a pregnancy and childbirth against their will, especially a victim of abuse, and especially a child. No one should have the right to violate another person's body like that. Yes, I am grateful for the life I have, but quite frankly I should never have been born.**",

Im sure it does the same to many other people.\n\nThe thing is, we cannot change the evil in one go. There is no thanos snap in reality. From my POV we cannot weigh the brightness and joy we bring to others against the misery. They are incomparable. \n\nDo what you can to bring joy to those around you, encourage others to do the same and relish in it.

                            "comment": "Apologies to reddit for riding on a comment for this to be seen but I feel it's important to get out as many perspectives on this as possible.\n\nI had a friend in PR who grew up in deep poverty. Poverty so bad, he had numerous health problems they couldn't afford to address, and continued to develop more. Because he was so poor and looked it, he faced a life of bullying. His mom also had her own health issues for the same reason, they were both depressed. Father wasn't in the picture, knocked up the mom and disappeared from the island. She had no family support. Best she could do was try and date someone to try and have a male figure around for support, but it never worked out. The men in her life who'd be with her despite having a kid were always dirtbags.\n\nI grew up watching my friend constantly tell our friends about how much he wished to die, specifically how much he wished he wasn't born. At first we thought it was jokingly like most ppl say and do, especially since he'd always chuckle. Yrs went by, his expressions of wanting to die got more and more serious but it was always very logical, reasoned and analytical, like it wasn't a cry for attention, maybe even not motivated by depression but he was trying and tell us genuinely it isn't that he hates life, he's just miserable and is exhausted of suffering. And he took every opportunity to express his desire to not have been born, bdays, wishing fountains, wishbones, everything. But y'know we just thought it was one of those things us kids go through.\n\nThis kid hardly ever smiled. Laughs he had lasted little, and he was just always low on energy. Most of the time we'd have to drag him outside if not he'd stay in all day, starving and laying in bed thinking about God knows what. He was sweet and caring and he'd always have our backs so we loved him. Eventually at the age of 16 it really dawned on me when I looked at my life and his and realized man for as long as I've known this kid he has seemed completely miserable and in pain, and it felt bad. He was never happy. Eventually when I was 18 he died from a respiratory problem at 16.\n\nI realized he was never joking, I think he really thought about it cause he would rationalize it like this \"well if I was never born, I wouldn't have tasted life to desire to be alive in the first, it wouldn't matter, maybe my spirit could've been born with a different mother and I could have a better life.\" I'm paraphrasing but that's how he'd talk when me and our friends would tell him \"dude how can you say you want to not have existed? Like videogames, cartoons are the best thing ever, how can you want to miss out on that knowing what you know?\" \n\nHe really was genuine about wishing to be unborn, cause he never attempted suicide, he'd just mope, not shower, starve and try and decay away in bed.\n\nAnd now I think about it, he was a case of someone who could've benefitted so much from having been aborted. He was given an opportunity of pro-life and he grew up understanding these things, his situation and if he had the choice he would've made his mom have an abortion.\n\nHis mom never recovered after his death, she became mentally unstable. It's nothing but one really depressing story with no ups to it.\n\nSo this is my problem with anti-abortioners. It's these thing they don't think about. \n\nAre they gonna take care of the mom and her kid if she doesn't abort? I mean even when the kid becomes an adult at 18 and has both physical illness and mental illness and reluctant parents who don't wanna be responsible for them anymore, are they gonna shove their way a bunch of resources so they can pay for college? A car? Or get them a good job where they can afford an apt and healthcare where they are also able to enjoy their own lives with being able to spend money beyond just necessities because being happy is very important to survival?\n\nHaving a life just be born for the sake \"religion\" or some morality doesn't do squat for the kid or even the mother if there's no one or nothing to take care of them properly and give them a life above poverty.\n\nPro-lifers just wanna pat themselves in the back with \"we did it! Another life not aborted\" but than walk away soon as that kid is born. Where's the rest of the support and compassion for the rest of that kids life? Why aren't they fighting for that kids mother to get equal pay in the job market? Why aren't they fighting for minimum wage to be higher so that kid can provide for himself eventually? Why aren't they fighting for free or affordable college so that kids doesn't have to work for peanuts and never be able to afford to address their health concerns? Why aren't they fighting for that kid to not have to pay an arm and a leg when he needs an ambulance due to an accident?\n\nNo let em be born and let's forget about them after! What's the point of even caring initially anyway? Like what? Is this really all for a bumper sticker that shows how Christian or Morally righteous you are?\n\nUgh",

And just reliving this memory, I just realize my best friend spent his whole life suffering every aching minute. He had no say, no choice, he was forced into shitty circumstances. And no one understood him, you know much it sucks to never be understood, to feel alien, abnormal!? He was legitimately a torture victim, tortured til he died, a prison of poverty. Not one but two lives suffered. His mom endured so much for him, to try and give him a life, I mean I remember the rotation of men in their lives, and how much she put up with abuse from them just to provide for her kid. And for nothing cause it never worked out. That crap isn't fair.\n\nI've been thinking about reaching out to my hometown in PR to know how the mother is these days but I'm afraid to find out what's up. Last time I knew about her was over 10 yrs ago and she was living with her parents reluctantly for them, due to mental illness.\n\nI feel you can slap so much logic to pro-lifers, really make them realize why abortion is necessary, I mean it's not a hard concept to understand, really it isn't. So what gives? I know why, it's because liberals are pro-abortion and they just simply what to go against them, they are the \"enemy\" so whatever libs want, they're actively against. It's all just out of spite. \n\nTHIS POLITICAL WAR IS FREAKING EXHAUSTING",

I think it's beautiful the experience has touched you so and helped shape you into an ultimately more compassionate person. I endeavour to be that way too. \n\nI'm glad you're spreading this message to help your friend's suffering not be one that was in vain.

As he is getting older I made a point to spend time with him and make sure I knew him. That did not go well. I became horrified at the person that he is. Apparently not only did he know a lot of the abuse was happening but he still thinks it was the right thing to do. He never tried to help any of the children because he believes if he ignores it he will still go to heaven. The older he gets the more he doubles down on sexual abuse being okay as long as it is done by a member of the church, because God can absolve of us those sins. Oh, yeah, and being raped is committing a sin.\n\nI have so much more compassion for my parents now.",

I \"destroyed\" her life. She hinged her entire self worth on me, and any time I faltered, she lost her damn mind. She'd have an existential crisis where her entire life would become meaningless if I were any less than perfect.\n\nShe felt trapped. She went through a phase over the course of my 8-10th grades where she wanted to pretend that she lived alone. She forced both my grandmother and me to stay hidden in our bedrooms for years. We weren't allowed to use the living room or be seen. We eventually gave up and ignored her antics when it became clear nothing we did would make her feel better about herself.\n\nWhen I went to college, she barely talked to me. Now we're no contact because she switched to getting an enormous amount of joy out of making me miserable. I don't believe she is capable of loving me.\n\nDespite all this, she also wouldn't let my father have me. It became a game to keep me from him. It was made worse that he got shipped out thousands of miles away for the few years before kindergarten so I had no idea who he was. My mother poisoned the well and made me scared of him. My father fucked up, too, telling me that he was going to take me back to his home. This stranger effectively threatening to kidnap me. I developed agoraphobia because I had a fear for 30 years that I could be kidnapped at any second. The custody battled was waged until 6th grade where I had no idea if I was going to be taken from my home and forced to live with a bunch of strangers.\n\nIt's really fucked me up. I have had severe emotional problems since middle school. My entire adulthood has been completely dominated by my emotional problems. I barely have an inkling of a freedom of life because I have spent the vast majority of my life just trying to keep my head above water. Just trying to convince myself to not kill myself.\n\nPeople SHOULD NOT have children simply because they got pregnant. There is no way they can keep up the fa\u00e7ade long enough so a child can grow up healthy. \n\nI should have been aborted.",

So on top of one parent alienating him, he was also alienated by gender. The girls bonded, and to this day they get together for a week vacation every year. My father not invited, of course.\n\nSo, my father turned to abandon emotion. He still massively struggles with it. Since I grew up needing to read subtle emotional cues, I can see the bubbling of emotions under my father's skin. He's completely afraid to express them. No one else can see it. They all think he's emotionless, and I try to point out that he's actually extremely sensitive, and his only coping mechanism is to keep everything tightly under control.\n\nHe couldn't stand being around his father any more so he joined the navy at 17.\n\n10 years later, in pops up my care free mother. She had a thing for the navy guys and dated several of them. Heck, she's still into military guys, her longest relationship she still has is an army guy. She's been dating that guy on and off for close to 25 years now. She *does not* want to commit, though. I don't know what's going on with that, but any time a guy proposes, she dumps them. Sucked for me! Because all of a sudden my favorite person on the face of the earth disappears on child-me. Because he proposed \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAs my father says, my mother was the light of his life. It was an amazing feeling to come back to port and have someone so excited to see him. Of course! He felt completely alienated from his family, so to have someone actually *like* him would obviously be an incredible feeling.\n\nIt's not uncommon for an emotionally controlled people to get with emotionally uncontrolled people. I've repeated the same dynamic with my husband. I was pretty conscious of my choice when I first met my husband, because I really needed my primary relationship to be more emotionally muted so I could have a source be emotionally calm and not rile up my emotions. My husband is still unable to share his insight as to why he picked emotional me... He still is unable to perceive his own emotions. Which... Causes a lot of problems.\n\nSo, my father fell in love. And somehow my mother got pregnant. I don't know what happened, but one thing they both agree on is that they were no longer together by the time I was born. \n\nMy mother says he dumped her on the side of the road because he was cheating on his wife and didn't want a baby to blow up his marriage. But... He didn't get married until I was 3-4 years old. And his \"first daughter\" was actually his wife's daughter from a different father. \n\nHe says he got shipped out for another 6 months. But... When he came back he wanted to \"try again\" with my mother. Within the first year of my life he would visit regularly. And he proposed...\n\n... Oh. He proposed. That's why she dumped him \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nAnywho, so he got transferred to the opposite side of the country for 3 years. No visits, no phone calls. He got transferred back to our side of the country when I was 5. Promptly attempted to kidnap me out of school \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \n\nAnd the rest is traumatic history for me.",

The anti-choice crowd always seem to make it seem like it's just women sleeping around using it all willy-nilly, very often it is women like me, who were in a long-term relationship and had birth control failures. I want to note that this was before the ACA which mandated that health insurance cover birth control pills with no co-pay. I wanted an IUD after my daughter, but the cost was about $1,000.

My MIL said he really should have been born via C-Section but she thought the OB was punishing his bio mom for being a \u201cbad girl\u201d and getting pregnant out of wedlock. \n\nMy husband always thought that his bio mom didn\u2019t have a c-section because it was her choice, and held a grudge against her for that. He has seizures that could be linked to O2 depravation at birth and with the collar bone break. After what my MIL told me what she did I told my husband that it likely that his bio mom was never even given that option and she was forced to go through what was likely a very painful vaginal birth. He softened a lot towards this biological mother he never met. \n\nI feel so sorry for this girl who likely never had any choices regarding giving birth. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am very very thankful for my husband and he had a great life with his adoptive parents who gave him the world.

In the case of humans, unwanted children perform worse in school, make far less average income throughout their lives, have a higher chance of being victims of child abuse and are plagued by all sorts of trauma stemming from a difficult childhood. An increase in all of these problems is the scientifically predictable outcome of a law like this.\n\nI don't even want to mention men abusing the law to consciously force their child onto a woman either by rape or by deceit, whether it is some sick \"sentimental\" act or just something new that commonplace rapists can get away with for their own enjoyment.

Don't know if you enjoy reading/watching philosophy, but if you do, you should check out Derek Parfit's discussion of the non-identity problem.   \n Essentially, that's his word for the tension between the fact that, given the butterfly effect, it's fair to say that had things been even slightly different we wouldn't exist at all (after all, we are all the result of one single sperm combining with one single egg) and the fact that it seems like we can legitimately complain about the actions of our predecessors - specifically, about those that influence the world in ways that affect our lives.  He examines this problem in the context of climate change (e.g., can someone born in 2030 blame people like me for not taking stronger climate action, when it seems fair to think that they likely would not have been born had we taken stronger climate action sooner) but I think someone in your position might find it interesting nonetheless.",

            "comment": "Thank you, I appreciate your story.\n\n\n\nMy teen mother came from a family with a tradition of physical and emotional abuse, mental health issues and addiction. When she went off birth control to try and hook my father into marriage. When she got pregnant - 3/4 of my grandparents pushed for abortion, but my grandmother shielded her... she obsessed over me before birth, then went to party and \"live her life\" traveling when I was a toddler. Some of my earliest persistent thoughts were \"where's mommy?\" Before I naturally bonded to my grandmother and stopped caring.\n\n\nThis woman and her family were never fit for children, and I \n paid for it. When she came back into my life, she was abusive, unstable, demanding and she held a grudge because her (8 yo) son loved his grandmother- who was present- more. She had borderline personality disorder, chronic health issues that she neglected(in part for her attention), and made shitty decisions - like to move the whole family to a ghetto off north avenue in Baltimore for 3 years to be labor for a townhouse renovation (which was really just a mess of broken walls and breathing filth and plaster) once she burnt up all the rest of what little the family had. To too that off, I never knew anything about my father until I was 13. I spent a few years thinking my step dad was my biological father.\n\n\nI was emaciated through high school, twitchy and anxious from home abuse, socially stunted and separate from my peers, made fun of for being the dirty poor kid. saw family violence, death threats took on obscene amounts of class work and extracurriculars to stay out of the house. We were so poor at one point, we were heating our house with an open oven... and came back after school to a kitten baked alive. That's some nightmare fuel every child should experience (/s).\n\n\n\nBut I got lucky, very lucky. My father turned out to be guilt ridden, but one of the most respectable people I have ever met. The whole side of that family took me in eventually. I had good Samaritans at my school that put money on my lunch card anonymously, teachers and friends families who took me in and let me live with them, an aunt and uncle who took me down to visit every summer to live like a normal teenager... and a mind that was inquisitive and resilient, dreaming of getting out and going to college no matter how many expensive ass loans I had to borrow against my future.\n\n\nBut it didn't end after escaping my mother. I was an 18 year old with no support battling mental health issues, addiction and had seriously lagging social, emotional, fiscal, and rational growth. My 20s were consumed by bad medications, bad doctors, substance abuse, isolation, self-loathing, directionlessness... I dodged a lot of killing shots from hard drugs offered and creating my own unwanted children. I got lucky lucky lucky in my adulthood and was able to develop into a healthy, logical, empathetic individual. When my mother died from unmanaged diabetic complications, I felt nothing. I think disassociating myself from her is more telling than feeling a lasting hatred.\n\n\nBut most people from this kind of background don't get the chances and lucky breaks I did. Like you, I would have been born anyway b/c my situation. But the kinder thing to do would have been being aborted. Don't get me wrong, I really like my life and am steps away from achieving some life fulfilling goals. But noone should have to go through a childhood of such dysfunction and pain because they are born into a family that can't, or doesn't want to, care for a child.",

I'm not sure they are able to fully take in the reality of other people's suffering. They have a particular story in their head and they layer it over the world. It reminds me of Q anon folks; they cannot take in that their child sex trade fear fantasies are not real nor can they direct their energy to lobbying government for actual programs that help children.\n\nIn a way, they too have been broken. I believe that when people get into such a cult-like mentality, something has traumatized them and they cling to their fantasy and ideals, afraid to face their own pain. They can't help real people at that point, because they can't face real world pain and fear (and actually do something helpful), because they can't face their own pain and fear.\n\nOP is not doing that. OP is facing her pain and living in the real world, even after so much suffering. This is powerful and world-changing. And maybe it will get through to some of those people who are in the cult-trance, even a bit, and help change this horrible law. Thank you for your bravery, OP.",

One of my grandmothers talked her out of it, but she was super drunk one night when I was 11 or 12 and she told me that she wished she had gotten the abortion. \n\nShe kicked me out and sent me to live with someone she knew was abusive. I was abused for several years, and she got sober and raised my younger brother. He thinks she\u2019s the best mother, but she still makes me so anxious till this day. \n\nWe\u2019ve kind of repaired our relationship, but she\u2019s got some type of bipolar disorder. This makes her very unstable and unreliable. She only acts like a real mother whenever other people are around. \n\nA few days ago I almost passed out at work and was having heart problems. She wouldn\u2019t even consider leaving a coworkers grandsons baseball game to come drive me home. My grandfather had to leave my grandmother, who can\u2019t walk around the house by herself, by herself so he could come get me. \n\nMy mother is selfish, mean, and just uncaring. She never should have had any children. Her relationship is so damaged with my sister that my sister wants nothing to do with her. She\u2019s not a good mother. \n\nThere have been so many times when me and my siblings have talked about how none of our parents should have ever had kids. \n\nShe even allegedly had an abortion out of spite to get back at her first husband. She claims it was a miscarriage now, but I don\u2019t believe her because she lies all the time. I almost wish she had the abortion because at least I wouldn\u2019t have to go through all the mental and physical trauma that I have.",

I oppose it.\n\nOne of my relatives is forced birth but she doesn\u2019t realize that position causes women to abort babies that are wanted . How? Well an unmarried woman used to be ruined by a pregnancy so they had to abort. They would lose their jobs, families &amp; community support. Now they can raise a child on their own terms. \n\nMy relative is one of those oops babies that was the product of an affair with a married man . She would have had to be aborted when women weren\u2019t in control of their bodies. She doesn\u2019t realize that &amp; in her naive self righteousness she will never see that.",

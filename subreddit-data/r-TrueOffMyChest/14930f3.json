    "postText": "Using a throwaway for privacy.\n\nI am currently visiting university and I had a crush on this girl. She is playing in an entirely different league than me. The difference in attractiveness is so insane that I would've never thought I had a chance with her. So it was even more surprising when she asked me out. We had two dates and after the second one she already wanted to do the dirty. I was feeling so happy. I couldn't believe my luck. She wasn't just a random girl. She was pretty, she was nice to everyone, was quite popular and seemed to be a genuine good person. You know like someone who would help homeless people out if they saw them on the street.\n\nBut sometimes life is too good to be true so when when we did the dirty her boyfriend came home. Yeah she had a boyfriend which I didn't knew until then. Even though if I had paid attention more I could have realized that before. She was studying but had enough money to afford her own apartment. Even if she had a job while studying its still very unlikely unless you have someone who pays it for you.\n\nBut back to topic. When he came home he caught us in the act. I jumped up collected my clothes while they were screaming at each other, apologized to him and left in an instant. I feel bad. Not only for this poor guy but also because I couldn't see what kind of a person she was. I am disappointed how I could've been so wrong about her. Today she tried to talk to me again but I don't wanna have anything to do with her anymore.\n\nWhat does she think? That I would stay with her after that? If she cheats on that guy she could and probably would cheat on me too. Sorry I just had to let that out.",

    "postText": "TW: attempted suicide\n\nIf my parents aren't arguing with me, they're arguing with my grandmother.\n\nMy parents are entitled and narcissistic gaslighters. Saying those things I know doesn't really explain what I mean. Let me give a few examples to be clear..\n\nIf I want to ask where something is or if anyone has seen something, I just don't and try to figure it out myself. Why? Because there's a good chance I will get the response of \"It's not my job to look after your stuff!\" or \"Really? you lost [insert item here]?!\" or \"I don't know! You should have been more careful keeping track of these things\".. rather than just a simple answer of \"Idk\" or \"I haven't seen it\" They have to rub it in my face that I did this really common thing that almost everyone does: forget where you put something\n\nMy dad has no consideration for anyone but himself so long as you're in *his* house, or *his* car. When I ask him to turn the volume down on his phone or in his car, his response is always \"You know, it was perfectly fine before you came in here. This is *my* house/car. I can play it as loud as I want.\" To which my response is \"yes, but it affects me being in the same room (the kitchen to get food) and I'd really appreciate if you turned it down\" you get the gist.\n\nHere's the kicker: My dad has dragged me up the stairs by my ankles while I was screaming and holding on the rails at 17 y/o while my mother did nothing.. all because I didn't want to wear a bra. After which I tried to off myself, and after talking to like 8 nurses, a social worker, 3 doctors, and some counselor over the span of 4-5 days, all my parents had to say was \"We're sorry, but you need to know when to listen to us and do what we say.\" I don't get how you can drive your child to the hospital for attempted su*cide after a huge fight and not seriously rethink how you parent. and not take any responsibility or recognize that maybe you just might have been in the wrong for once.\n\nWhen I have tried to confide in my mother, her response is to immediately compare what she's been through in life to my situation. Not in an attempt to connect or relate to me, but to minimize my experience and say how much easier I have it. I have explicitly said, \"I appreciate you helping, but I'd rather you not compare you're experience with mine\" trying to explain what helps when I'm stressed or upset. Instead of responding with any compassion, her response is \"Oh, god, well, I'm sorry i'm such a horrible mother\" and quite literally throws her hands in the air as if I just told her off.\n\nWhen my parents do similar things like this to grandmother, it is so insanely hard to listen to. They're typically screaming and it's the same phrases about the same topic going on for an hour or two back and forth with the argument going no where. I can't say how irrationally they're handling things because then I get yelled at, and they have ultimate say and power in the house and yeah...\n\nIt's difficult for my parents to handle my grandmother because they don't have the patience necessary to care for someone with such extreme anxiety and depression like she has, but that just makes it all worse. Too much of the time it feels like nobody is happy in this house. It kills me because over the past 4-5 years, I've grown to dislike my parents who I once thought the world of as a child. I see my friends with fine relationships with their parents, and it just makes me bitter and jealous.\n\nAnyway, I have an exam tomorrow that I need to study for, and I wouldn't have been able to focus in the slightest if I didn't say this to someone.. so yeah",

But everything came crumbling down for me this year and I've had to move back in with them. It hurts to the core and even being around him makes me want to vomit and induces anxiety just knowing he's in the fucking house :(",

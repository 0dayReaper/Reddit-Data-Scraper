    "postText": "I live in north brasil with my mom and two brothers, we have always lived here. My boyfriend is from south brasil and we r gonna try to move in together this year, the ticket has been brought. Im going in 29 days.\n\nThe exact quote i heard from my mom today was :\" im not that type of mom that wants her kids close at all times. I want then independent and very far away\"\n\nI asked my brother if he wanted to watch one of our favorite movies together because he's on vacation from work and it ends today ( It was Star Wars, we watched all the movies together some years ago ) Well, he said no, because he wants to watch other things alone ( this \"no\" ,means \" never\")\n\nThe other day, i tried talking to my other brother, excitely that my boyfriend brought a expensive bed to make me feel more at home and comfortable, he said \" butter\" , i said \" what?\", he said \" there's butter on my finger\"\n\nI'm actually really scare and anxious about being so far away from the only place i know, i wish i could talk about with someone. My boyfriend is busy in general and i dont wanna bother.\n\nIt feels really bad to be the only one worrying about making some last good memories...",

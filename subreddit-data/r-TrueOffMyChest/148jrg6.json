    "postText": "Throwaway, please don't share this.\n\nI want to get this off my chest once, and then I'm done. Just to preface this, I have a partner currently that I have been dating for around 4 years now, we are both seniors in college, and I am INCREDIBLY happy with him. He's the love of my life, and I'm so happy that I got over my crush when I did so that I got to meet my partner, befriend them, and pursue a meaningful relationship. \n\nMy issue is that when I was interested in him, he entertained it HEAVILY. We would be on the phone for hours every single day. At first, he was my best friend. We were inseparable, we did everything together, and I started falling for him after we almost kissed in my car. I tried to force it down, I tried to just stay friends with him, but I felt guilty for hiding my feelings and I told him. When I told him, he said that I was \"like a sister\" to him, which I was totally fine with after my initial sadness. I still kind of liked him, but I was so happy that I got to keep my best friend. After a while, I started branching out and trying to find new people. I would talk to him about these people and he would encourage it over text, so I thought everything was totally normal. Then, I met a guy at a party with our friend group and was really hitting it off with him. The entire night, he avoided me, and I found out later from our friends that he was super jealous and angry that I was talking to that guy. \n\nWell this continued for the next several months. I would meet people, flirt for a bit, I even had a few dates, and every single time, he would get angry. He would criticize every single boyfriend or girlfriend that I had, talk about how jealous and mad he was to our friends, and so I finally confronted him on why he was acting this way. He said he was just being protective, but I knew that was bull. I asked him if he liked me and said that was the last time I was ever going to ask. He said no, so I moved on completely. Our contact fizzled out after a while, and that's when I met my current partner. When the two of us met, there was an instant connection. We became close friends really quickly, and our friendship blossomed into a romance within a few months, and we have been inseparable ever since. We did break up briefly due to some mental health/physical health issues I was having, and that's when my crush came out of the woodwork and started speaking to me again. He heard about my breakup, and he said he wanted to help talk me through it. I knew that I was still in love with and planning to get back with my partner, but since I figured it had been long enough since the two of us liked each other, I didn't see the harm in hanging out in public as friends. So, that's what we did. He helped talk me through the breakup, gave me really good advice, but one day while he was driving me home, he stopped the car. He looked at me and said \"I'm sorry, I can't pretend like this isn't killing me\". I asked him what he meant, and he said that he didn't know. He then reached over and cupped my face in his hands, sighed, and then kept driving. I was really confused. I got back home, and saw that he blocked me. \n\nFast forward a few months, my partner and I got back together. We went to some couples counseling, talked it through, and decided that we were both ready to give it another shot. We went to a party with the same friend group for the first time back together as an official couple (nobody in the group had heard from my crush in almost 2 months at this point, so I didn't expect that he would be there), and low and behold, there he was. I came upstairs first, he lit up when he saw me and picked me up and spun me around and started talking to me enthusiastically. I was confused, but didn't have time to react before I saw his face fall as soon as my boyfriend walked up the stairs. He looked at me, then at him, and then stormed out of the house. That was the last time I spoke to him. \n\nNow, present day. It's 4 years and counting with my amazing boyfriend, and last week I began receiving messages on instagram and Twitter from my former friend group. As I said, I grilled one of them for information, and it turns out my former crush has been telling people that he \"regrets not snatching me up the second he got the chance\", that I'm \"the one that got away\", that he misses me, that he \"always loved me\", and that he wants to be with me. The reason that this infuriates me is because he had his chance to have me. I was in love with him for two years, gave him multiple chances, but he wasn't interested/rejected me every single time. Now, it's too little too late. I feel nothing for him anymore, I haven't thought about him once until these messages started popping up, but now all I can feel is overwhelming anger. He's trying to come back into my life now that I am unbelievably happy, successful, and with someone who I love more than anyone or anything. Does he really expect me to just drop the best thing that's ever happened to me and come running into his arms? If I was that same pathetic 15 year old girl, maybe I would have. But I'm a 22 year old woman now. I know that I live in his head as some idealized version of myself that is still obsessed with him, but that isn't me anymore. His friends are trying to convince me to \"just talk\" to him, but I absolutely will not be doing that. My partner has supported me in all of this, and he even said that if I want to go talk to him for some closure, I should. But I don't need closure. He indirectly admitted that he always loved me, but that he was too much of a wuss to be with me back then. I am happy with my situation, and there isn't a single part of me that's wondering what could have been anymore. Instead of talking to me directly (he knows where I live, he knows how to reach me, he could talk to me if he wanted to), he sent his little boyfriends out to convince me to talk to him. He's still just as immature, and I'm not. If you're reading this, the answer is no, and that answer will never change. I wish you the best in life, but I want you to stay out of mine. \n\nThat's all I've got. Thanks for reading.\n\n\nEDIT: wanted to answer some questions. \n\n1. When I say \"couples therapy\", I mean we went to see my regular therapist who I have seen for years for several sessions to talk about our relationship. \n\n2. Yes, he told his friends to reach out to me\n\n3. No, i absolutely will not hear him out or see what he has to say.\n\n\nEDIT: UPDATE POSTED ON MY ACCOUNT.",

I was hurt but accepted it gracefully, we remained friends and in the same friendship group until we left uni. He was really nice to my next boyfriend and said what an amazing match we were.\n\nSo a decade later when friends start posting pictures of my wedding on Facebook and I change my name a few days later, he posts a really really long post that I assume was a drunken ramble about how I was the love of his life at 3am. Mutual friends I\u2019m still in touch with confirm he spoke about me non stop for over a decade and I had no clue. We were Facebook friends, he had my number, he could have reached out but never did.\n\nI can only guess he wasn\u2019t actually interested, it\u2019s just something he can beat himself up with, which is sad but I can\u2019t help.",

I realized I was just an ego boost for him and now that I made the decision to cut him off, he misses all the attention I gave him.",

I agree that he's seeing an idealized version of you in his head, and i have a feeling the novelty of \"snatching you up\" would wear off on him very quickly if it happened, he seems like the type who's interest in someone wears off the moment the chase is over and their feelings are being reciprocated",

It's not like he had feelings for you but was too scared to admit them incase you didn't feel the same. He knew how you felt. He just didn't want to commit to you. \n\nHe also doesn't like to see that you're happy and in love with someone else. He may very well feel now that he wished he'd done something and he was with you, but I think honestly he's a) using 'you're the one that got away'as an excuse to his friends as to why he hasn't settled down with anyone, and b) is getting his friends to reach out to you coz he wants to ruin the good relationship you've built. He wants you to still be wanting him and thinking about him and missing him, etc, and hopes by getting his friends to reach out, it may make you consider being with him, or get you to talk to him again, so he can continue giving you the mixed signals etc, in the hope it breaks up your relationship. So that your attention is all on him again. \n\nAgain, he likes the thought of having your attention, and likes to think of you pining and lasting over him, and can't handle the fact you moved on easily from him and met the man of your dreams who treats you right and who you deeply love. He's jealous he's lost your attention. He's jealous you moved on easily without him. And he's jealous you're in a happy loving relationship and you're no longer interested in him. \n\nYou're completely right to not bother even talking to him again. Nothing good will ever come of it. E had multiple chances. You're over him. You've moved on and he's out of your life and you are in a happy committed long term relationship with someone you love, and with someone who loves you. There's absolutely zero reason to even speak to him again. \n\nI would message his friends and say something along the lines of....\nI'm not interested in talking to him anymore. He had multiple chances to be with me. I told him how I felt back then at the time and he declined the opportunity to be with me. He's had multiple opportunities in the past to be with me. He shows interest but then doesnt follow through. He doesn't really want to be with me, he just wants me to be interest in him, and He just doesn't want me to be happy with anyone else.\n Please tell him not to contact me again, I am in a happy loving relationship with someone who isn't afraid to be honest about how they feel about me. I moved on from him a long time ago and you should tell him to do the same thing. I wish him well, but please don't bring him up with me again. \n\nThen go live your happy loving life with your partner, who genuinely loves and appreciates you, and who equally love back. This other guy isn't worth your time. Leave him in the past where he belongs.",

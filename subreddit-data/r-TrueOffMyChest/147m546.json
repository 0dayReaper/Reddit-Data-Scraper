    "postText": "This year one of my best friends began distancing herself from the rest of us (6 of us in total, all 16F) and I wouldn't mind that much if it weren't for how she was doing it.\n\nWhenever she would come to hang out with us in the morning, she always made a big deal of commenting on how xyz wasn't in yet. Whenever anyone had done something fun say go to a concert or attend a course she would never ask about it and showed very little interest in our interests. One of my friends hyper obsesses over shows she likes and this friend would snap and yell at her whenever she even begun talking about them. This friend has expressed that she feels looked down upon by her and it makes her feel like shit because she cant even talk happily about what makes her happy.\n\nWe had a school trip recently where she was overall an ass but at one point she asked to sit with someone and just as they were getting on sat with someone else. At another point in the trip she sighed when we asked if a friend (whose bday it was) could talk to us for 2 minutes.She is blatantly obvious about the fact that she shows no interest in us and yet expects us to act normal around her. Its really difficult to hang out with someone when you are giving 100% of your energy to try and impress them and they wont even give 25%.\n\nThe rest of us are all annoyed and don't know what to do about this. We feel communicating this to her would be a personal attack but none of us want to be rude and start a gc or hanging out without her despite the fact that we dread being in her presence and only feel second best when we are with her. \n\nWhat would you do? I kinda wish she was an outright dick so we would be able to cut her off. I don't think this behaviour is gonna change and i'm sick of dreading talking to her.I know that we are 16 and this isn't the end of the world but it doesn't make it suck any less.",

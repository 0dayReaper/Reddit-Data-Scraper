    "postText": "I hate being a woman at times because of the standards placed on us. If we don\u2019t marry or have kids by a certain age we are seen as no good. I\u2019m only 24 and I\u2019m already panicking that time is running out to find a partner. I\u2019m worried that by a certain age all the good men will be paired up and I will be seen as leftovers to men.\n\nI\u2019ve had relationships before and hookups. I can get attention with no problem. Most of the time guys use me and they see me as a pair of boobs because I have large breasts. People say they wish they had my size but it makes many men put me in the \u201chookup\u201d box but not the \u201crelationship box\u201d. I also struggle with anxiety and I have a hard time being outgoing. There\u2019s really no opportunities for me in my area to meet people my age because everything is geared towards older people. \n\nI\u2019m sick of feeling this way. I\u2019m sick of seeing others fall in love and not me. I do everything to be good to others and I always get taken advantage of. A year ago I was in a situation that messed me up for real. A guy took advantage of me after I opened up to him about my depression, he strung me along, and ghosted me. Soon I found out he had a girlfriend the entire time. The girlfriend had deformity and I have this gut feeling he could\u2019ve taken advantage of that as well\u2026  \n\nI\u2019m in therapy working on myself too so please do not suggest that. It\u2019s that it gets so hard. I wonder what I did so wrong to be in this position. I always let a guy lead because I don\u2019t want to emasculate them. Maybe I won\u2019t find anyone ever. It\u2019s my dream to be a wife and mother and if I don\u2019t get that my life is over.",

Be kind to yourself and allow yourself to heal from this asshole who doesn\u2019t know how to treat someone properly. Give yourself time to fall in love with yourself, and become your own best friend. Find strength in who you are alone, then everything else will follow. Just keep pushing through it and keep going, there will be someone out there who falls in love with you and everything that you are!",

I got over him but what he did hurts. He lied when he told me I was beautiful, I wish I could tell him to his face how ugly he is. Not like he\u2019s a looker. He\u2019s short, super skinny, balding, etc.. so not someone who women would desire so it wouldn\u2019t shock me if he treats people badly due to his low self esteem.",

Take a deep breath and step back. Finding a partner will never make you happy. You need to love yourself first and learn to be happy on your own. You need to see that your self worth does not lie in a relationship with someone else. Put the idea of a relationship on hold and continue to work on yourself. If something is meant to be, it will be. Sending blessings and healing your way.",

Life will throw good things at you when you least expect it or even try to obtain whatever you want. And honestly, I\u2019m happy with how things are going right now for me because I decided to focus on myself and be the kind of woman I want to be. Don\u2019t worry about dating and stay single until someone comes along when you\u2019re not even looking. And I know what that feeling is was like because I\u2019ve been there myself but have learned to not give a fuck and do me. Remember this quote \u201crun your own race\u201d -chili from bluey",

The guy is an awful person and he lacks any self awareness. He uses people who are vulnerable in some way to him which is sick to think about. It sucked seeing him happy with her while I was picking up the pieces.",

I\u2019ve given myself away too much and now I just feel like a mess. Sex is now a complicated mess. I\u2019m riddled with guilt and shame although I have always put in 100% with anyone I\u2019ve been with. Maybe I\u2019m destined to be alone. The thought of love is foreign. I feel useless trapped and alone.",

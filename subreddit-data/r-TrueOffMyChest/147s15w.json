    "postText": "As the title says, my best mate is an alcoholic. I first noticed he liked his drinks when he came to my house (I live in another country) and sank a fair bit of alcohol. But this year, his gf broke up with him and I noticed how he began acting erratically, telling me he needed a drink constantly. He almost cried when he had a beer, and few days later he brought whiskey into college with him, which is of course not allowed. Now he\u2019s working with his dad and mates and he\u2019s having 5+ beers before the evening every day, and sees no issue with it, he can\u2019t even admit he has a problem. I don\u2019t want to keep going at him for it but I\u2019m genuinely worried since both my parents have had their stints with alcohol issues",

            "comment": "This is a tough one. After being an alcoholic for over 6 years I have to say I never saw anyone drink who was just actually happy. I always felt attacked when people would tell me that I was \"avoiding my feelings\" but it was true. Maybe he is running from something that happened to him. Honestly if someone really sat down with me and talked to me (or just sat with me while I cried for a while) I would have stopped. I had no perspective and no comfort. That is a dangerous combination at a young age,especially. Life is hard and scary, sometimes its to much for some of us. Sometimes we just need someone to be there for us. Even after we try to run them off because I sure did. Thankfully they didn't give up though I would have understood if they did. It's hard for them but it's hard for you,too. He is lucky to have such a great friend.",

Then he started telling me he felt better, and for a while he did, now it seems like he is over his ex, he\u2019s got a new girl, but he\u2019s still drinking, and I just want to know why, but he\u2019s being evasive and won\u2019t admit to anything",

I don\u2019t know if your intention was to be condescending with your comment, but wether he could be \u201cdiagnosed\u201d as an alcoholic or not I can tell there\u2019s an issue with my friend",

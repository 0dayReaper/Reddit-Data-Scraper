    "postText": "I'm a beginner when it comes to weed, I've smoked it very few times with my boyfriend but not enough to make a huge impact. \n\nMy friend \"A\", who I've known since 4th grade (we're going to be sophomores this year) had invited me out to her place since we hadn't seen eachother in so long since she moved. Her and her friends have been long time enjoyed of it and have a good tolerance.\n\nThere was 7 of us, me, A, and her 5 friends, who I had only spent a day with, but honestly I didn't really get involved with them much as I was really just missing my boyfriend knowing he could've been there.\n\naround 9pm A and I went to see her friends who were sitting in a tent in a circle, I didn't expect much to happen until they added a second joint to the rotation and zipped up the tent. I noticed something was wrong when I wanted to get a cup of water but I was dizzy, I felt like I wasn't awake, but I stumbled out after they forced me to get the water even when I said I shouldn't leave. it continued to get worse once I got back.\n\nmy breathing had started to get rougher, and I swore it was all a dream, I screamed twice, hoping it all would stop if I did, but it didn't, I only developed a panic attack and cried as \"K\" (one of the oldest there and someone I didn't know well) held me and tried to ground me. I've noticed when I do smoke I get talkative and very open about my thoughts and feelings, I'm vulnerable in that state, and no one was shutting me up so I continued to embarrass myself and just ruin something that could've been good.\n\nI could tell K was mouthing things about me as I sobbed and they were trying to do other stuff. I was so embarrassed, I felt shame and pity. but I just took what care they gave me. \n\nK said it wasn't my fault because they should've been more careful, but once we got back to A's place she kept telling me she had warned me and it happens. \n\nI feel gross and guilty, I feel bad blaming them for what happened, but I never wanted to get that high. I never wanted to meet the fate I did, she didn't warn me, she said she would help me. I don't want to go back to her place or be around those people again, I'm worried they hate me or something. I'm embarrassed and I can't get what happened out of my head. I don't want to make myself out to be the victim, I don't want to be that pitiful, I just keep blaming myself really.\n\nI dont know how to feel. I just know I feel gross. I can't get the experience out of my head. it was so terrifying.",

            "comment": "As you can tell by my username, I'm a pothead. There are certain unspoken rules among weed users that perhaps need some sharing:\n\n\\- Beware of other people's weed, specially if it's from a stranger and you are trying it for the first time. You don't know the genetics, the additives or the concentration, you have no idea how powerful it can be. If you still want to try, start with one little puff and wait 10 or 15 mins before trying again. \n\n\\- Do your own thing, don't be preassured to smoke at other people's pace. It's ok to say no, everybody has their own limits.\n\n\\- Don't smoke if you are nervous, worried, insecure or any other negative state. Weed amplifies whatever you are feeling. No wonder you had a panic attack surrounded by strangers.\n\n\\- Bad trips happen, it's nothing to be ashamed or embarrased about. All potheads had at least one of those because of reasons, after you learn your own limits it usually never happens again.\n\nIf those people make you feel bad or whatever, then fuck them. No honorable person would shame another for a panic attack or a bad trip.",

Surviving a bad trip is like one of those boyscout badges you earn. When you meet other potheads  you interchange weed stories, you can totally tell  yours \"that one time I felt I was out of my body\" \ud83d\ude02\n\nI had a bad trip once because I followed the pace of another heavy user. We were at my apartment and this friend was visiting me. I almost faint and this person was telling she wanted to leave and that I was an inconvenience. I felt betrayed, because you don't do that shit to a person having a bad trip. I was seriously fainting but with whatever energy left I opened the door so she could leave even if that meant passing out alone, because even in semi-uncounsciousness that attitude she had pissed me off. Never spoke to her again.  \nAnyway, point is, that's how I learnt not to follow others rythm \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

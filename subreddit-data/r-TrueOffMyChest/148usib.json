    "postText": "I would always say I'm lucky my MIL is an excellent, kind, and intelligent woman... My FIL on the other hand...\n\nWe're renting him an old apartment he hasn't used in years, keeping it clean and making it comfy until finding something better, he lives in another city, this was my husband's grandmother's house. Some time ago, when we were dating, my lease was about to end we contemplated the possibility of living in this apartment, but his father told us that maybe when my husband got a work (he was living off working eventually in whatever place he could get some money). \n\nWe married 7 months ago, my lease ended and my old landlord didn't want to renovate so we had to move forcefully, at first FIL didn't want us to rent from him because he used \"sometimes\" to sleep when he and his wife were too drunk to drive home. Finally, after some back and forth, we begged because even with my husband's work rent prices went too high to pay. We agreed on a lower rent (based on the average) and utilities, everything is paid before 10. \n\nThe first week after we moved my FIL's wife open the door and went to the bathroom, she didn't even knock on the door, didn't say \"hello\", or anything. Then my BILs entered and told us they were around and wanted to say \"hi\". She came out of the bathroom and asked about a calendar with a Jesus image, I told her where I put it after cleaning, she took it, told us the place was a mess, and left. That night my husband called his father and told him to, at least, send a message before entering. She got mad, and told us it was HER house and \"how dare to ask her to send a message to enter HER house\". \n\nShe has told everyone that this house is for her children (like yeah, forgot completely about the stepson) and that she's so kind to let us live here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTonight we ended at a horrible point, my BIL (18) sent a message to my husband asking us to not be at home so he could \"pierce and bang with a chick\" next weekend. We told him that it wouldn't be possible because my husband only gets one day free per week, we have a dog and ultimately we live here. We offered one hour without us here, he could pierce this girl and do whatever he wanted in that hour range. He got mad and told us it wasn't our house and that he didn't want to see my husband and that was the reason he didn't want us in the house. Hubby is devastated, he loves his brother and even when the relationship with FIL is kinda strained he still loves and cares for his little brothers. \n\nYes, we're moving soon, we're planning on cutting all contact and my husband wants to change his last name to his mother's surname because he doesn't want to have any relationship in the future. But in the meanwhile, we're just holding on to not lose the roof on our heads.",

    "postText": "I used to have an unbelievably outrageous social life by just being fun and nice to people. I can never get enough of peoples stories and personal experiences, so I think I make people feel appreciated and celebrated by just listening and being genuinely excited and impressed. When I went thru a divorce I realized those people really weren\u2019t my friends. They believed my ex\u2019s lies and suddenly all the women hated me and their husbands were DMing me. So that was entire friend group gone. I was still invited but I chose not to go after I was literally personally excluded from something. I\u2019m from CA and now live in the south so I didn\u2019t know anyone else. I got a great job, in sales that I excelled at, until I didn\u2019t. It really wore me down, the cold calls and constant rejection really took it\u2019s toll.  \n\nMy best friend, since I was 12, left CA to move to the south with me! Well, it turns out she was a raging alcoholic who was running from multiple DUIs. She stood to lose her medical license if she stayed there. While she lived with me she started spilling secrets and drunken musings with my current boyfriend. Because we were so close I told her all of the stupid things you think to yourself, like \u201cI won\u2019t ever have to worry about my weight because he\u2019s fat\u201d\u2026 just things you say to your best friend when your a bottle of wine deep. I love him\u2026 but I\u2019m not 17, I\u2019m 40\u2026 that\u2019s just not all there is to me. After about 6 months she did a bunch of dumb drunk things and moved out. We no longer speak after she showed up to my daughters 8th birthday party late with the pi\u00f1ata and drunk with her underwear as outerwear. \n\nMy job ended, the branch closed and I fell into a terrible depression where I wouldn\u2019t leave the house for weeks. I\u2019m getting better now. Moving forward and getting the help I need to get through this. But with all the work I\u2019ve done trying to climb out of this dark lonely hole I haven\u2019t made any friends. Literally the only person I\u2019m inviting to the wedding that I\u2019m not related to is the wonderful woman who dogsits, babysits and house sits for me. \n\nWhy does this feel so terrible? I can\u2019t tell people I\u2019m having a tiny wedding because I\u2019m a loser.",

            "comment": "Honestly, I feel like you're doing yourself a huge favor.  I invited over 100 people to my wedding because all of these people expressed how excited they were that I was getting married and how much they wanted to be there.  About 40 actually came: 20 were family, 5 were out-of-state friends (3 of whom were in the wedding party), and the remaining 10 were local friends and their dates.  We went through all that stress and expense trying to make everyone happy and, in addition to the low turnout, I was miserable most of the day between an argument with my mom and a migraine I couldn't shake.  My (now ex) husband and I always regretted not just going to the courthouse and skipping the whole wedding thing.\n\nYou're not having a micro wedding because you're a loser.  You're having a micro wedding because you want this to be an intimate event with only the people who mean the most to you.  You don't need to spend a bunch of money on a big party when you'd rather invest in your marriage and your future with your spouse.\n\nCongratulations on the upcoming wedding!  I'm wishing you the happiest of marriages and a wonderful future. \u2764",

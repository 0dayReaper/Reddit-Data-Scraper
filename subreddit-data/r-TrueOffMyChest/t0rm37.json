    "postText": "\n\nMy husband and I have been struggling with infirtility , We've tried some options and right now we're looking into Surrogacy, My sister agreed to do it but my husband said he looked at how much time and money IVF would take and slowly started hinting that we take the traditional way. I was too shocked to even say anything but he acted like what he said was not even that big of a deal. He explained that it's just a quick way for us to have a baby and spare the money and time to use later. I'm 100 percent against it, that is way I'm backing down and am no longer comfortable with this whole surrogacy route...I can't even imagine my sister's reaction once she hears my husband's suggestion. I'm both devastated over the fact that 1, he'd even entertain having sex with my sister just because he wants the easy way and 2, if I ever agree despite feeling unconfortable then I will always carry this memory of how the baby is conceived. I refused and shut his suggestion down hard. He's now started guilting me saying I don't trust him then saying I'm selfish for choosing to back out when he still wants to be a dad like he expected when he married me. Basically blaming me for my infirtility issues.\n\nI feel so devasted and like my body is useless and has failed me to the point where I could expect any negative comment on it wether true on not. emotionally and mentally... I just can't express how I feel right now.\n\nby the way my sister is 4 years younger than me. I'm 34 years old and my husband is 37.",

The second time I talked to them the one who was going to have the baby dm's me and tells me she's on the pill DL and she's bi and just wants to be with a guy (guys). She was just going to lie for 2-3 months and say it didn't take. I'm thankful I thought with my big head not my little one and shut that Convo down quick.

If he's desperate to have children then he might leave eventually. Creepy \"have sex with your sister\" is pretty nasty, if he is thinking \"yes, this is ok\" then personally I do not think he has the best in mind for the people around him.\n\nThere are plenty of people out there who will love you for you. Life is pain, I would rather someone to stand against the world with than someone who apparently I would only consider worthy because \"they can carry my shitling 'innit.\n\n**Thoughts the next day while drinking morning coffee:**\n\nWait...

But at least in  our state (CT), at that time you could not contractually sever parental rights before the child is born; the biological mother had a certain period to consider post-partum.  \n\nThat said, maybe the surrogacy could get around the child support payments if she decided to keep it, since she would be breaching the contract. \n\nCaveat: I am not a family law attorney.

Barring the whole part where your husband sounds more and more like an abusive douche and this is your sister, for god's sake, you will be legally screwed. *Specifically* you. This hypothetical baby between your husband and sister will share their DNA, and none with you. If something happens especially during pregnancy, birth, and those first few years, you will have very little rights to this child and it will be dangerously easily for you to lose them. There is a reason that surrogacy is so highly regulated in western countries. At *minimum* you will need lawyers to draw up an ironclad contract that asserts you as the baby's legal and rightful mother, and costs for that will quickly be comparable to IVF.\n\nThere was a post on AITA where a woman and her husband chose a family friend to be their surrogate, and she was complaining about how this friend was quickly usurping her place as mother and wife. She was essentially cut out of everything involving the pregnancy, with only her husband driving the friend to her appts and catering to her every whim. It also bears mentioning that this friend had lost her four-year-old daughter just a few years earlier. When the commenters asked if she had any sort of contract or went to a clinic, she admitted that all they had was a verbal agreement. The response? *OOOOOOOOOOOF*. ***OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF***. Because for all intents and purpose, her husband had merely knocked up some woman and he was about to have a baby with her, and the poster was shit out of luck.\n\nSeriously, this is worthy of divorce. Based on your husband's behavior, you will gain *nothing* from this. Do not even consider asking your sister to be a surrogate without both parties getting lawyers. If he tries to handwave that, then clearly he doesn't care about making sure that your rights as a mother is firmly and unequivocally established, and you need to make of that as you will. I'm sorry this is happening, OP.",

(I\u2019m giving him the benefit of the doubt before I make my next point\u2026)\n\n2) If he actually meant having sex with your sister, RUN. You do not want to be tied to this man by a child for the rest of your life. Think you hate his bullshit now? You\u2019ll get to hate it for the 18+ years you\u2019ll spend sharing parenting of a child. Seriously, *RUN*.",

    "postText": "I want to start this post by saying, jesus. I never thought I'd get this response from reddit. I've never used reddit, but this event/experience is something that is troubling me and I felt the need to reach out and tell it to people.... Due to me being quite insecure and maybe a bit traumatized from this situation, this experience, I tried to find some support by writing this as if it happened now. What I described in the earlier post happened to me 5 years ago. I'm really thankful for all the comments, it would've been amazing to have back then. But now is here, and I can tell you what happened after everything.\n\nTo reply to the comment regarding that the girl was upset with something. We were really close, she felt something, I did not. It was fairly platonic, kisses, cuddling but no sex. She was upset and disappointed with me after me disappearing for a whole summer. This was almost a year before the accusations and rumors. And she celebrated my birthday between the two events. \n\nI'll try my best to explain what happened now. I'm sorry for making it as if it was now, but I was unsure... here we go...\n\nSo what happened next?  \nAfter me graduating I was really alienated from everyone. Everyone I had known for all my life was just gone. I worked my ass off to just think of something else. I tried to repair the damage, and reconnect with old friends but with no luck. But out of the blue I heard from an old friend (I still have some contact with him) what he had heard and so on. \n\nHe had heard that the girls boyfriend that spring (not something when we hang out, the situation earlier) was the rumormonger. The boyfriend, one of the muscle-no brain-guys at the high school I went to, hated me from before. Now, looking back at it, of course it could've been about the girl. That we had a fling and so on. But this guy had hated me for ages. For example explicitly stating I was not invited when he was hosting, or even as brutal as trying to hit me and start fights at parties. So this guy, started rumors saying that I raped his girlfriend. Me raping HIS girlfriend.\n\nThis was the reason why she couldn't tell the ABT who did this, and had to back the story in some way. I have recordings of every session, every meeting. I recorded them telling me her whole story, what I did and everything, which was something completely different than what happened. I know that some might question whether or not she perceived some situations differently or something. Well her story was things I've never done, we never did, it was complete fiction.\n\nI went around to friends with this new information. I had \"proof\" that I was innocent, I didn't do anything. The information that it was the boyfriend all along, together with the recording of her saying that I did nothing, it has to get my friends back. This should make everything back to what it used to be... But no.   \nWhen presenting this new information to old friends, trying to prove my innocence, the only reaction I got was \"No one cares anymore bout this, you should stop caring as well\". This rumor that destroyed literally my whole social life is something that I should stop caring about?!\n\nMy thought was/is this: If this rumor wasn't that important to care about to begin with, why was it so important back then?? How can it be so important, then so meaningless and significant AFTER it has destroyed? How can it not change their view of me? \n\nIt is as if they have decided that \"maybe the rumor wasn't true, but now when thinking bout it he's probably a perpetrator anyway\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis event, this experience, is something that is troubling me constantly. I now study at uni, I have new friends, I feel welcomed and that I have people that got my back. But I feel the scars. I feel how I changed due to this. I get easily defensive. I get intrusive thoughts about what people have heard about me. Or if people are trying to distance themselves. I always over-think, trying to plan how to solve situation IF something would happen.\n\nI feel that this sometimes can damage my friendships I now have, like an self-fulfilling prophecy, and I to be honest don't know how to handle it. \n\nThank you for reading. I guess this was what I actually needed to say. I feel damaged and I don't know how to repair. \n\n&amp;#x200B;",

You do not need to prove anything to anyone since you have all the proof you need along with the fact that you are innocent. \n\nMy request for you is that you seek therapy so that your past doesn't spoil your present relationships. \n\nI wish you the best.. Take care of yourself.",

To be betrayed by your friends is also something that I don\u2019t even know how to manage given that im also in highschool and to just imagine beign alienated from them crushes me. I would like to read your previous post but I see its been removed by reddit. So from what you said here, I just wish you the best of luck.",

                    "comment": "A girl he was childhood friends with and almost got together with felt slighted by the almost part and got together with a meathead douche who had it out for OP, partly because of his girl having liked OP. Douche spread rumors and the wider friend group and slowly the whole of OP's peer group just stopped talking to OP with OP not knowing what was up. \n\nEventually OP gets a former friend to admit the contents of the rumor. OP confronted girl via recorded phone call where she admitted that the rumor of OP raping her was of course not true and that she held some resentment towards OP regarding them not getting together. She then refuses to clear up the rumor slandering OP as a rapist. \n\nOP tries going through a mediation group with the school. The group said that even with OP's recorded call of her admitting it's not true they were just going to let it be because they didn't know if OP coerced her to say that and she gave the group a statement saying that he did assault her. \n\nThis was close to graduation so OP just graduated alone and isolated from his entire peer group with only his family. \n\nOP contact of lawyers told him that it's not worth it to try and go after the girl for slander as she could double down and try to get him convicted of SA, but as she then wasn't going the legal route or even harassing him he should just let it go. The rest is in the update above.",

            "comment": "I'm sorry you had to go through that some people have the whole mindset when they are in the wrong they don't want to fully admit fault. Or they feel guilty about it but try and brush it off. If I were you idk if you still can at this point if the statue if limitations ran out. But I would sue for defamation and emotional distress. I hate when people especially women lie about r**e and SA. They don't have to feel the brunt of the backlash and the mental distress it causes to those they falsely accuse.\nTake time out for yourself your not damage just trying to rebuild your life after a earth shattering lie. Leave all of the negativity in the pass I would also talk to a therapist if you aren't already.",

            "comment": "You're done. None of those folks are ever going to care about what's 'really' true. They had their fun, it was really satisfying drama, and now it's over. The good news is, you're all kids. Listen, you were extremely unlikely to remain friends with any of those people once school was over.\n\nAll this means is that you check out of high school early. Graduate, walk away, do whatever you were gonna do with your life. Don't look back, don't ever talk to any of them again.\n\nAlso, gonna point a thing out here, something you likely won't believe but need to hear, something that you need to have in mind: closure isn't really a thing. There is no combination of words that can be said, by anyone involved, that will ever cause this to have a 'satisfying' end, or make you feel like you get it, or learned something important, or any of that shit. Sometimes people just do shitty things, and for a variety of reasons it all gets out of hand. Afterwards, no-one ever says \"Oh fuck, I was wrong! That was bad!\"\n\nJust move on. You're done. They suck. That's the lesson. That's the closure. Don't talk to them.",

            "comment": "They probably never cared that much because they knew to some extent that it was exaggerated at least. Mutual friends would have known that you two didn't get that far and that she was disappointed when you left for that one Summer after. They probably went along with the narrative because that boyfriend was known to be willing to get in physical fights over not getting his way and things steamrolled from there. So it became a mob opinion type thing where no one wanted to remain your friend enough to go against the grain.\n\nAfter time passed, they cared even less and you coming out with proof just makes them feel a bit guilty so they want you to be quiet.",

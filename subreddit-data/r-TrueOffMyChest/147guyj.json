    "postText": "i\u2019ve been chasing a girl (one year older, a grade ahead of me) for a while now, but she said she wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship yet. she had never had a guy confess his feelings to her, and additionally said she found me attractive and liked me, but wanted me to realize my self-worth issues and understand that i should respect myself and not judge my worth on my achievements in life, but rather on my character. at the time i was 15, she was 16. i\u2019ve been getting better at all that, and all throughout high school i would flirt with her and poke fun at her (i was being respectful tho, not trying to overstay my welcome or anything) and things went great between us until my friend (also one of her friends) told me that i should ask her to prom for her senior year, and that she (friend) had \u201cinside info\u201d that i would definitely get a yes as an answer. i did not get a yes. i got pretty depressed, and eventually she graduated. we didn\u2019t keep in touch. not long after, as i was graduating high school, i got an anonymous note in my locker from an admirer asking for me to text them sometime and that they really enjoyed my company and my super long rants about random topics. it looked a lot like her handwriting and it fit her description perfectly, but since she had graduated a year before me and was in college i couldn\u2019t be certain it was her. i ended up texting her a couple weeks ago, trying to keep it casual, never really asking if she wrote the note. eventually the conversation became kinda forced, so i just asked her if she knew who wrote this note, and sent a pic of it. she seemed to play koi, saying things like \u201cidk, looks like someone is trying to frame me\u201d and \u201cits def not me \ud83e\udd2d\u201d, but soon it just felt like she legitimately didn\u2019t write it, and the convo felt forced again. so i asked if she was still interested in me (not worded like that lol, i kept it cool \ud83d\ude0e) but she said that she never really felt that way to begin with and the thought of a guy liking her was clouding her judgement. she never liked me, just liked being liked by me. she liked the chase and my pursuit for her love, forever being out of reach. so now i have a note that leads to nowhere and a freshly reopened wound, courtesy of the girl of my dreams.",

Forget the notes etc, she probably is writing the note, got the friend to tell you about the prom etc because as she told you herself, she likes being chased. These people don\u2019t want caught though, she\u2019ll never actually get together with you.",

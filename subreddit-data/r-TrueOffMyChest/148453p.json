    "postText": "I'm so tired. I work 2 jobs and I'm in full time college. Not exactly unique, I know. But on top of that I was recently diagnosed with a fatty liver so I'm concerned for my health, I just recently moved and the place is a fucking disaster because I haven't had the time to sort it all out and it feels like I'm living in an episode of Hoarders. Lately it's just one thing after another and it all just piles on. \n\n\nI have always been the person on top of everything. I don't forget things, I don't lose things and I've always been crazy organized. This week alone I have misplaced my purse or my keys (or both) at least 5 times. I'm forgetting important dates and almost missed my aunt's birthday yesterday. \n\n\nI just feel so drained and I don't know how to catch up. I get ample sleep but somehow I'm still exhausted all the time. I just need to plow through until I can finish school. Then I can apply for full-time jobs and quit my side gigs. I just want to be back to the way that I was before. I feel like I'm losing it.",

I was depressed for a long time and in the course of 2.5 years gained 100lbs. The diagnosis is scary but the doctor says it is reversible if I change my lifestyle, which I am actively doing (10lbs down so far).",

    "postText": "I (22 nonbinary) have been dating my partner \"Luke\" (22 nonbinary)  for almost 3 years. This is one of the few relationships that I've had that stuck around to see me at my worst. I really care for Luke and love them so much.\n\nRecently, about 5 months or so, I reconnected with an old friend, \"Frank\", and group that I had missed. I introduced them to Luke and I thought the first time they interacted was really good. For context, Luke is autistic and has trouble with social cues and context. After I introduced Luke to everyone they started to make the effort to hang out and get to know the group without me present which I thought was sweet. Until it came to my attention that Luke was making some people in the group uncomfortable with the things they'd talk about. Example, I was brought up in conversation and Luke started talking about my body and other general stims. I had a conversation with Luke about this and they apologized. Ever since then I could tell by how the group speaks to Luke that they don't particularly have the patience for them. Frank and I have spoken on multiple occasions (at my request) and hes told me things are fine.\n\nI just don't really know what to do in this situation. I've tried to speak to the group about it and they all tell me things are fine, but then get cross with Luke. I always take Luke's side unless they're actually being disrespectful or rude. :/ I feel stuck.",

    "postText": "I work for a fairly large company in the tech industry. I've worked there for about 5 years now and I have a fairly high up role in management. Over the last few weeks, I got roped into helping build a new team within the company and was assigned to do multiple interviews. This was fairly short notice for me, so my job was only to do the interview and give my impressions of the candidate and the results of the interview. The company is also just back to doing in person interviews so the process is even more wonky as of now. When I received the list of candidates for the day, I saw the name of a man we'll call brad. It had been over 15 years since i had last seen him, but I could never forget the face of the man who made my high school years a living hell. \n\nBrad was your typical bully jock, I was an overweight theater kid in ap math and science, and you can see where this is going. Those were the worst years of my life, and brad was one of the contributing causes to that. So to see him in the candidates here was a shock to me. \n\nI didn't believe it at first, but when Brad walked in for the interview I knew that I was face to face with the man who bullied me in high school. At first brad didn't recognized me, but as we sat down he remembered who I was. He tried to play buddy-buddy with me. Pretend we were friends in high school, and I played along. I did the interview, he did, ok. Nothing stand out, but middle of the pact. He made a joke that I would \"get him the job, right?\" I laughed along and he left. \n\nI finalized the interviews yesterday. I wrote brad a scathing review. Downplayed everything good about him and exaggerated his flaws. Also wrote in that he tried to coerce me into giving him a good review because he \"was an acquaintance in high school.\" \n\nIt's been 15 years since I graduated high school. I am an entirely different person than I was then. But for some reason, I was dragged back to those days, and I don't know how to feel.",

He came over, we chatted with a group of people, he waited for the right moment, then asked semi-privately my forgiveness for what he and couple of others had done. He said, he cannot expect me to accept his appology, that he wished he could undo it, but that he really felt sorry for it. \nI accepted.\nFelt good.",

I wasn't physically absuive but I would joke kids. At the time I just did it to make myself and others laugh. Shitty thing to do I know but that was really all it was and I didn't think about it past that. I didn't have the perspective that my mere presence could make someone anxious and dread coming to a certain class. So stupid.\n\nNow, I would be absolutely embarrassed to run into one of those people I used to joke in public. I'd have to apologize to them. Fuck the guy who OP had to interview.",

I felt like the only way to avoid being bullied was to become one and I didn't like who I was when I was like that so I stopped and just stuck to myself after that. I had friends outside of school so that made it easier to not feel so isolated.\n\nI am ashamed at my actions towards them. I had someone confront me as an adult about my behavior towards them as a child. We happened to work for the same company but in different departments that occasionally collaborated. Sadly, I didn't recall but I said that  even though I don't remember it happening, I apologized and explained that I was an asshole. I didn't give excuses and he accepted my apology. We actually became pretty friendly while I worked there and would often chat for a bit if we ran into each other.",

Schools 'say' they  have a zero bullying policy, but that's not true! (I could tell them how to enforce that particular policy!)  Teachers and staff turn a willful blind eye to it all the time. Sometimes it's even the teachers doing the bullying! Certain kids are almost magnets for attracting bullies, and I hate it! Not only did I experience it, so have younger family members. It hurt my heart, and infuriated me that they were being bullied, but it would do the same if they ever were the bully! I agree with you about that!",

They never got in trouble, never a detention. But I think knowing I/we had their back helped.\n\nNo one should feel like the rules require victimhood. Schools should not be in the role of teaching victimhood or creating the dynamics that allow it to happen.\n\nBullies need (at least) as equal dose of their medicine. Often, this is just what they need. Offered early enough in life (by peers), I think it helps kids learn the ropes of being a whole, full person. It mandates empathy or, at least, understanding and respect.\n\nThis psuedo-enlightened stuff drives me bonkers. I am not pro-violwnce in the least. I am anti-victimhood. And that means enabling kids to draw lines. And back them up, even in an environment that cares more about the escalation than the triggering event.",

At this point, I'm not sure if it'll ever be better. I don't like talking about it. I tell people that I was bullied but I never ever tell them what my bullies said. I'm still too ashamed.

So I ended up not doing any of that classwork or exams for that year. I legitimately left the stupid exam papers blank and slept through them, or skipped class in the library. The worst thing is the school KNEW he wasn't a good teacher. There were SO MANY complaints about him. But they kept him like 5 years too long because 'they couldn't find anyone'. \n\nI also had some language teachers openly ridicule my essays, which made me like learning the language less and less. Tbh I think that's why none of that language (in this case, Malay) ever properly sticked with me even though it was a compulsory language for 11 years lol.",

I thought that, at 29, having a lot more experience and maturity, I'd be fine seeing her again. The first lesson was fine as she didn't recognise me, now its all gone to shit again. She has her favourites who have sweet nicknames and free passes when they don't understand something, whilst in my case, 2 weeks ago when I was struggling I got sent out in the corridor for 10 minutes to work alone, told to come back and present it in front of the class. Obviously I fucked up, I was tired, stressed and panicked, and got a load of passive agressive comments and insults hidden behind the sweet temperament she puts on. Afterwards, at home, I spent 3 hours crying on and off. At 29! \n\nIt got so bad that I skipped the last class before the holidays and only went to collect the homework for the 2 weeks off. And I'm not looking forward to seeing her again in a week and a half, even though I'm working my ass off. I know that confronted with her, her expectation of me to fail, having to present work in front of the class (who now all think I'm pretty stupid), all the confidence I have just goes to pieces. Yet I know I'm capable, I know I can do it, but something about her turns me into a trembling teenager who is destined for failure. \n\nOn the flip side, to make a bit of money, I'm teaching at a high school for the 6th year in a row, and I make damn sure my kids walk out feeling good about themselves, and confident that they're progressing. I praise the slightest improvement, spend time going over and over the same thing if needs be, and do not tolerate any remarks made by one kid to another. I also don't force them, if they don't feel comfortable talking in front of everyone, thats fine. Every year,  after 2 months, even the shyest kid in my class will be tentatively raising their hand to answer and by the end of the year confidently speaking in front of everyone sure in the knowledge that even if they make mistakes, they won't be ridiculed for it. \n\nI hate bad teachers, and vow to never, ever make a kid feel as broken as I did. Well, as I do now, once again.",

The second letter was to my parents stating that I was not allowed to go to the vacation as I was considered a too high risk for the group. I was never violent or anything, I was most of the time getting kicked out from class cause I would go see the teachers cause I was getting bullied.

One time, they stole and hid my instrument and when I reported it, I was told I'm \"too sensitive\" and sent to in school suspension. Another time I was being called derogatory sexist names by a girl and the teachers said I should not be wearing what I'm wearing since I do look like that term. Mind you, I was 13 and had a skort on that went to my knees. They witnessed the bullying and either encouraged it, turned a blind eye or made me be the problem. It was similar for my bully's child as well. Small towns, man.\n\nEdit: a word and punctuation.",

Not surprisingly, he's also one of the very few who isn't dead from driving under the influence, dead from ODing, or in prison, and he actually has a decent job not in our shitty rural hometown.\n\nHe said that it didn't excuse his behavior in any way, but that he grew up in an abusive household, and he didn't know how to cope with that in a healthy way, so he bullied people at school to give him some sense of control over his life, some sense of power, since he felt so powerless and helpless at home where he was beaten regularly.\n\nI was like, dude, I wish you had told me. We could have been friends. Fuck, my mother would have taken your abusive parents to court to try to take custody from them and she would have fostered you. We could have been brothers. She was just that kind of mom.\n\nBut I'm glad that he's living a better life now and doesn't have to beat up people to feel in control anymore. He deserves a decent life, especially after overcoming trauma like that and apologizing.",

Something clicked in my brain and I decided I was going to make him pay for saying that. It took a couple of months but eventually I had him completely ostracised from our social group and he started having to hang out with the kids in the year below. My previous girlfriend turned him down anyway. It was a totally uncool move on my part and I should not have been so mean spirited. \n\nFil, man I\u2019m sorry. I would reach out again but I think that is just me wanting to make myself feel better. I hope you have forgotten all about me. \nI remember kayaking on the George\u2019s river and hanging out by the river fondly. You were a good friend to me, sorry I wasn\u2019t one back.",

Only one of those kids was a girl, and she arguably got it the worst.\n\nNow, I never explicitly bullied her, but I\u2019m ashamed to say I was a bystander. I laughed along at times with the other kids, and I hate myself for that. At the time, I had a lot of issues at home and was afraid the kids would turn on me if I said anything, but that\u2019s no excuse. I regretted never standing up for her.\n\nI left that school and moved to another one to finish my primary school years. Then, a few years later, when we started high school, this girl and I were enrolled at the same school. We didn\u2019t have any classes together, but I saw her around and occasionally said \u201chi\u201d in passing.\n\nOne day, we had to walk to a specific location for a school function. The teachers lead the pack, and the entire grade level followed behind. We weren\u2019t separated into classes, just walking as a group. I ended up walking near this girl, who was walking by herself. I caught up to her and talked to her for a minute about how annoying this function we had to go to was, and we just talked about assignments and other stuff kids talk about. \n\nIn a little break of conversation, I decided to apologise for the way she was treated back in primary school, for not standing up for her like I should have, and for any pain I may have caused her by failing to act or laughing along with the other kids at times. I\u2019m not sure why I chose that moment, but for some reason I did. And I\u2019m so glad I said something.\n\nShe was very touched by what I said and it meant a lot to her. None her bullies or any of the other kids had ever said they were sorry for what she went through. She said she forgave me, and then we went back to casual conversation. She was noticeably a lot happier afterwards; she was laughing more and joking around. We sat next to each other at the function, and walked together on the way back to school as well.\n\nYou never know how much it may mean to a previously tormented kid to acknowledge what they went through and tell them how sorry you are for it, even if you weren\u2019t one of the bullies, and just a bystander like I was.",

I never forgot any of the people who bullied me, and it was a fairly large group, it stuck with me for a long time after I left school. \n\nI moved to Wales when I was in my early 20s, so I would come back home to visit my partner at the time. He was always having parties and one of the people that bullied me was there. He apologised to me off his own back but by this point, I was kind of over it, so I told him not to worry, it had happened ten years ago and I had bigger things to worry about than when I got bullied ten years ago. We got on really well after that, until my ex and I split up and I cut contact with all his friends. \n\nI was really surprised that he'd apologised, I wasn't expecting it at all. I think being older and having more life experience has helped me to be able to forgive him because I can look at the situation more rationally and I'm so grateful for that.",

They deleted my vacation days  for illogical bureaucratic reasons and that was what tipped me over the edge. \n\nMind you, i was never bullied, if that makes a difference. \n\nSo after a year at my new job, i see a familiar name on the next list of hires for this season. Mr. Familiar was one of the reasons i left my old job, and here i am being asked about him since our old common job appeared on his resume. I was DELIGHTED to tell my boss this douche was one of the reasons i left my old job, and that erven though he was fired before i quit, he made the work place so unstable for me that he was what got me looking for a new gig. And he was fired for a specific reason that most industries look down on regardless of how legal it is in other places. \n\nWhich was 100% true. He would have introduced toxicity to the work place. \n\nOP, if you feel this guy was going to introduce toxicity to the work place, you're fine to take delight in being the instrument of that asshole's misery.",

Like, I probably weigh the same now as an adult that I did in 4th or 5th grade, and I\u2019m more than a foot taller now. \n\nThere was one kid, I\u2019ll call him Charlie, that made my life especially miserable, and was the most hateful asshole kid I\u2019ve ever encountered. I could go on for days about all the nasty things he did and said to me. This kid pelted me with *rocks* one day telling me that \u201che was trying to help me because he wanted me to run so I could stop being such a fat ass.\u201d Just awful.\n\nI lost my \u201cbaby fat\u201d around 7th-8th grade, and by Freshman year (not to toot my own horn) I was in good shape. I had grown into my body, developed a chest, and took up boxing so I was pretty fit all around.\n\nBetween classes one day, I was getting a soda out of the machine in the breezeway and he came up behind me and pulled some \u201cHey ma, looking good...can I take you out tonight?\u201d or some such nonsense. I turned around and immediately recognized him, but he had zero clue who I was. I just said \u201cSeriously? You really don\u2019t remember me, do you?\u201d When he said he didn\u2019t, I asked if he remembered the fat girl he used to pick on every day in grade and middle school. He kind of chuckled and said that he did, but he still wasn\u2019t putting two and two together. \n\nHis friends were all watching at this point, so I spoke loud enough that they could hear and said, \u201cYeah? Well that little girl was ME. And I don\u2019t go out with douche bags that bully other people because they\u2019re such sorry human beings that they feel the need to do that to avoid dealing with their own miserable lives. Maybe you should be a little nicer and you won\u2019t find yourself in this position again. Now, fuck off, I\u2019m not gonna be late to class because of you. Thanks!\u201d I pushed my way past him and walked past his friends that were cracking up laughing and already giving him hell for it.\n\nI enjoyed every petty moment of that exchange. It was friggin glorious. I hope you relished in writing that review as well. Karma comes back for everybody at some point!",

So much so that I tried to avoid him all the time cause he was rich.  Turns out my calling him a spoiled fat kid when he was bullying me was what he hated.  He also went home every day feeling like shit and even talked to his parents about switching schools because of me\u2026\n\nCrazy\u2026 kids are just so shitty to each other they don\u2019t stop to think.\n\nWe sat and chatted for a couple hours, hugged it out (two men in late 30\u2019s) and apologized to each other.  \n\nWeird.  \n\nSo i dunno, some bullies aren\u2019t evil demons.  Just self conscious kids.",

Lucy had some missing muscles in her face that made her mouth droop on one side and one of her eyes close slightly. When we were in high school, I used to call her a pirate and yell things like \u201caargh\u201d and \u201cyarr matey\u201d when I\u2019d pass her in the hallway or wherever. I knew at the time that it was wrong, but I was so insecure about myself, I kept on doing it. When I graduated and went to college, I took some psychology classes as a freshman and realized that I was not only wrong, but that I could have emotionally scarred this young girl for life. I felt so guilty and disgusted with myself. I tried to find her, but there was no social media at the time. Three years later, I was at our local Westfield Mall eating some garbage in the food court. I glanced up for a moment and recognized Lucy immediately. I became nauseous and dizzy with anxiety. I worked up the nerve to approach her and said that I had no excuse for what I had done to her, that I was completely wrong, and that no one deserves to be treated like that. As I spoke, tears started dripping down my face and I was basically a blubbering mess. I begged for her forgiveness. I told her that I didn\u2019t deserve it and she owed me nothing. After a few seconds of silence, she stood up and extender her arms. We hugged and both of us cried for what seemed like forever, but was probably just a few seconds. We sat back down and she forgave me. To this day, I\u2019ve never been more grateful for anything. I learned the power of forgiveness. If she could forgive me for prolonged emotional torture, I could forgive anyone for anything, so long as they felt remorse, and sometimes, even if they didn\u2019t. We are friends now. What an amazing person Lucy was and is. I\u2019m still in awe of her.",

He also had 4 girls pregnant at the same time and was trying to change his name to avoid child support. Anyway he wouldnt even try to sell cars he would show up and sleep or play games on his phone towards the end of the month he wouldnt show up then call us at noon and say he is pissing blood and is at the hospital or other crazy excuses. One time he said he had a flat tire and cant come in to work and txted a picture of a tire blown out. I reverse image searched it and it was the third pic on google lmao.\n\n\nWhen i was working for a sheriffs office as a 911 dispatcher i see him come into the lobby for a job interview. I told the sheriff and the jail \"warden\" of my experience with him and they hired him anyway. Fast forward 2 months he is considered trained and put on night shift with me midnight to 8 am. Apparently he was fine during training then when he was on his own he just slept instead of watching cameras while his partner was going into cells (jail housed 160 people and we had 2 people for night shift for the jail).\n\nHe would show up drunk or yell at inmates being annoying and if the inmates were in the small holding cells he would play music over their speaker like barbie girl and shit all night. The sheriff said he wont give us a raise (3rd year in a row) so almost the entire jail staff left and they had this guy and 3 other people to run the jail. \n\nI quit shortly after because making $9 an hour fucking sucked with how crazy that county was. The deputies got paid $12 an hour and risked their life on pursuits all the time and got into shootings. Every deputy that was there longer than a year was married to someone making $18 an hour or more.",

People that are assholes when they are kids are usually assholes when they are adults. This CAN change, I'm just saying from what I've seen it usually does not. This is a valid thing to consider when hiring a new employee. People saying 'it was 15 years ago you need to get over it' aren't being rational. The 15 years only comes from the fact that you are seeing him after not seeing him for 15 years, it's not like you acting on your past experiences means that you held a grudge this whole time, it's rational to have a bias and assume he is an asshole now, especially after the brief interaction indicated that was probably true.",

People seem to think that kids bully others just because they enjoy picking on someone or something when the reality of it is that there's usually a reason why they do that. Kids are new to the world and don't always know how to manage their feelings and actions the way that (most) adults do. Sometimes a little trauma is all it takes for a kid to lash out at someone, especially if they don't have any kind of outlet or control when they're at home. Not trying to excuse bullying or anything, it's definitely a shitty thing to do but I think understanding the why behind it and trying to fix that could help a little more than just saying \"don't bully\"",

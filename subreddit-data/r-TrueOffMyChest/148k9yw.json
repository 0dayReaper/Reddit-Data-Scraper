    "postText": "I visit my grandmother once every month, my mother even less, and she guilt trip us regularly.\n\nThe reason is, she can be insufferable. She always has to give unsolicited advice. But it's not even advice she just likes to tell everyone how to live their life and if you disagree with her she becomes passive-agressive.\nFor example, my personal favorites; she told me to get on birth control pills (I have zero reasons for this), to not shave all of my pubic area because  it's not \"trendy\" anymore (why does she even care?),  to give our cat to a shelter because we don't need it (who says something like this?)\n\nThese are pretty personal things and it's not her place to tell me what should I do. It wouldn't be a big deal if she just said these things once and move on but that's not the case. She acts the same way with my mother too, but even more mean.\n\nSometimes it's great to spend time with her but I always have to filter myself and go along with these stupid advice if I don't want to be critized for half an hour with a few \"are you angry at me now\", \"you know I just say this because I want the best for you\" , \"you do whatever you want but I just had to say it\" thrown in. Which is fun, because then I feel like the asshole for telling my opinion about MY LIFE.\n\nIt was worse when I was younger tho, especially  when we lived with her for a few years.\nOf course I still love her, and I would say she's great about 50% of the time but I just feel so bad when she starts to push her views down my throat and expects me to follow them.\nI  have to lie or keep things a secret from her because I'm just so tired of not being good enough and being put down for everything I do. \n \nHonestly, even if she's not so bad now, I feel like most of my problems in adulthood stem from her behavior. I became a perfectionist, a people pleaser and I always feel judged by everyone.\nIt makes my life hard. I can't make decisions, I'm afraid of changing anything. I'm a self conscious mess.",

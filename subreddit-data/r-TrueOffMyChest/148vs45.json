    "postText": "I thought I had only strayed away from the relationship a \u201cfew\u201d times. But yesterday I thought more about it. I can name 17 people that I have been with while being in a relationship with my boyfriend. He has no idea. A part of me feels god awful about the entire situation. I\u2019m a serial cheater and have cheated in every relationship that I have ever been in. However, as a partner I do pour my heart out to my relationship. My partners never have any idea of my mischievous behavior.",

Making your s/o breakfast in bed once in a while doesn\u2019t give free reign to fuck whoever you want. They\u2019re completely separate issues. You know what DOES give you free reign? Being in a open, honest polyamorous relationship, which seems like the only viable option for you to not be the worst. \n\nAnd sooner or later, someone WILL find out. It\u2019s only a matter of time before it all comes crashing down. Hopefully that will be the reality check you need to realize what a terrible partner you\u2019ve been to these poor people. \n\nIf you truly cared about your partner, you wouldn\u2019t do this to them. You\u2019d come clean and break things off and work on yourself. Obviously if you\u2019ve gotten this far that\u2019s an unlikely course of events. I\u2019m thinking you\u2019re a \u201clearn the hard way\u201d kinda gal. So update us when your s/o finally catches you I guess",

One time sucks, two times he\u2019d probably think \u201cI did this to myself\u201d\n\nBut 17 times and he knows none of it\u2026like mentally, I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t even know if you can tell them that. That will give someone trust issues for a life time, and if he is invested enough, will definitely fuck him up for awhile. \n\nI don\u2019t know even know what I can say about you aside from end it and continue therapy. Don\u2019t jump into any relationships unless they\u2019re open. \n\nYou haven\u2019t even proven to yourself you have any self control.\n\nAnd the lack of it might possibly give him an STD he didn\u2019t ask for\n\nFeel bad for that man.",

If you cared for this person at all, you'd at least break up with them. it'd probably better if you didn't tell them why, Be honest with yourself, what you're doing is awful, especially to someone you pretend to share intimacy with.",

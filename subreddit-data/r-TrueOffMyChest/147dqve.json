    "postText": "This happened back in high school, over a decade ago.  \n\n\nSome backstory:  \n\n\nHigh school was not a time I look back into fondly. I didn't get bullied by students, and everyone in my class was pretty decent and we got along well. My biggest complaint lied with a certain teacher.  \n\n\nMr. M was our history teacher. He a young teacher in his late 20's. He was recently married and had twin toddlers, and bragged about his happy family in class. He was the \"hip and cool\" young teacher that got along great with students. And that's why, when I noticed that he had it out for me, I wasn't believed.  \n\n\nI was a pretty quiet teen. I had problems at home, so I would always arrive early to school and read books or study before class even started. Most of my classmates were the more friendly, outgoing type. We still considered each other friends and didn't have any issues.  \n\n\nMy school was very crowded. The school had 2 different classrooms for honors students, and both were packed full. No more students could enroll in our class as it was completely full.This is where my problems with Mr. M began.  \n\n\nI always got a nagging feeling from him. Sure he was friendly, but he felt \"too\" friendly. He also had students go over to his house for parties. It felt like he wanted to be a friend more than a teacher which is kinda odd, but everyone else in class loved him and didn't think much of it. I always felt off about how he acted, and would get teased for being \"odd\" because I don't respond well to teasing.\n\nThen a few weeks after the new semester began, another student that loved Mr. M wanted to move to our class. The school couldn't give permission for another student to come in unless someone willingly left.   \n\n\nI was asked to leave my class, but I declined, as all my friends were in this class.   \nWhy would I want to leave?   \n\n\nThen Mr. M behavior changed, and it felt like he was trying to alienate me from class.   \nHe would constantly pick at my differences as some attempt to get me to leave. He would teach a class, and decide to make an example of me by saying I wasn't part of this community because I was \"weird\". He would often say I don't belong there, or that its abnormal to be so quiet, or made comments about my appearance (I was the quiet emo kid). My classmates tried to assure me he was just joking, or trying to get me to open up, but I didn't think so.  \n\n\nHe also would dock points from my exams and projects without explaining why. Not a substantial amount, but a little bit here and there that wasn't explained. I studied hard, as a way to escape my situation at home, I was sure I knew the material. He would say I wasn't good enough to get full marks, but didn't provide a reasonable explanation. My single mother was neglectful and didn't care about school, so it's not like she would come over school to see my grades. I felt like I was on my own in this one.  \n\n\nWe were on our last year of high school and after all the points he docked added up, so my GPA dropped just right below what I would need to be a honors student. I would not get this scholarship I wanted to apply to because of a measly 0.2 point difference.  \n\n\nI was so frustrated that my parent, the school's deadbeat principal, and even my classmates said it was in my head. Surely Mr. M couldn't be a bad person, right? I'm just a bad judge of character and didn't understand the social cues of his harmless teasing.  \n\n\nThen on late April, in our last year of high school, Mr. M vanished.  \nHe had a history of never being absent so we thought it was odd. He just stopped coming to school with no prior warning.  \n\n\nSome students asked about it, and they were told Mr. M was sick and hospitalized.  \n\n\nMy issue with my GPA was also mysteriously fixed, but a little too late. The principal said was a typo in Mr. M's grade report, and I was actually still a honors student.I wouldn't have any trouble with my scholarship, but the activity for honors students had already passed, and I wouldn't be in the school's honor roll, since it was too late when they rectified that mistake. I cut my losses, and still walked along with other honors students on graduation.  \n\n\nMr. M never came back, and we finished high school without a homeroom teacher.This is where I feel karma was at play.  \n\n\nIt turns out that Mr. M had an illicit affair with a student, the student that he tried so hard to put in my class. He had never been hospitalized. He was fired from the school and lost his teaching license. He lost his wife and kids as well.  \n\n\nWhat we heard that happened was:  \nMr. M had housed a troubled student under his own roof without anyone knowing, and slept with him as \"payment\". (The student was 18, so he didn't go to jail for it, but he can never work in a school again though).   \n\n\nThe (ex)wife never suspected anything nefarious as her good husband was just helping a nice boy out. She caught them when she arrived home early.  \n\n\nThe school tried to keep it under wraps to \"save their reputation\" but someone that knew his wife leaked what happened, and word kept spreading like wildfire.  \n\n\nI truly felt vindicated after Mr. M got exposed for what he is: someone two-faced that takes advantage of vulnerable teens.",

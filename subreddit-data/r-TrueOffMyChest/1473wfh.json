    "postText": "My mom does not care when I\u2019m naked (21F). I have told her numerous times, that I feel weird about it. I would sit on the toilet, bath, shower, you name it, and she will just barge in. Very tmi, so skip if you are sensitive, but one time it was \u201cthat time of the month\u201d, and I was busy putting a tampon in, and she barged in. For instance now, I was bathing, and she just took her clothes off, waited for me to be done, so she can take a bath. She was in the bathroom with me, until I said, it made me uncomfortable, and she stormed out. I do not know what to do. I feel like as you grow older, your parents don\u2019t walk in at random times, it\u2019s weird. Isn\u2019t it common sense?\n\nEdit: I really appreciate everyone\u2019s advice. \n\n1. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sexual thing. I think she was raised that way. A big family living on a farm kind of deal.\n2. I can not move out, because I work 40-60 clinical hours, without pay, and on my other off days I have class the whole day. And the economy here is really bad.\n3. I did talk to her again and she said she will stop. But for in case, I\u2019m going to get the wood stopper.",

A rubber ball found its way near the door and a stronger push from the opposite side made the door ride on the ball (I guess it wedged instead of moving). A few seconds later the door was on the floor, glass shards from the door's window were everywhere and we were both doing the Spiderman pointing at Spiderman meme. So use wedges at your own risk...",

My dad and brothers get mad if I don't change with her because it takes longer, but we only have one bathroom and at the time I slept in the livingroom so I couldn't just change in my room as I didn't have one at the time. \n\nMy mom also hardly ever wants to buy me underwear (when I was a younger teen) and always just gave me hers to use. Same with clothes. I had a job, but I have a lot of health issues and had to quit. All the clothes I ever buy suddenly go missing, underwear included. It's weird and it makes me uncomfortable. For once I'd like privacy when changing, but nooo \ud83d\ude44\n\nAlso to add I don't have a door nob on my door. And when I asked for one with a lock both of my parents asked why I needed it and were suggesting I'd be madterbating or something. Like thats gross why even bring that up?

I am sure she is just in the habit of treating you like she did before. \n\nI think the reason why I was able to break it faster than your mom, was because my kid is a boy. You are her daughter though. Think locker room rules. It's all fine cuz you are both girls. Keep reminding her until you move out. I will also advise that after a few years, if you ever move back in together, it will be very different and more privacy will TYPICALLY be afforded as the time apart helps break mom habits.",

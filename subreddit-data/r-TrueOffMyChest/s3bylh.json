    "postText": "I'm a personal chef for a upper class family in the US with a multi-million dollar house who go on many vacations every year. They claim they miss authentic European and Asian food after living abroad for several years.\n\nWhen I first started cooking for them, I made elaborate dishes that took hours to make, finding the exact ingredients, examining each piece of carrot, potato, or chicken by hand. Finding the right brands and going to multiple grocery stores to find the exact pinot noir to make the perfect red wine sauce.\n\nThey didn't like it.\n\nI once messed up a dish and had to remake it really quickly, so I took a few shortcuts to make sure it was still tasty. A normally 12 hour dish, I made a quick version of in less than 30 minutes using vinegar instead of red wine.\n\nThey said it was the tastiest thing they ever ate. It reminded them of the times they were travelling through some European mountains.\n\nSince then, I've realized I don't need to spend hours making all the food perfectly \"authentic\". I stopped using expensive brands of wine (sometimes I don't even use wine at all. Grape juice or vinegar or even sugar seems to taste just as good, if not better to them). I've saved tens of thousands of dollars and probably thousands of hours getting cheaper ingredients that have already been brined or marinated, and they absolutely love it.\n\nThey even had me prepare larger meals for parties or events, and they'd claim it was authentic French or Italian food. They'd ask me what combination of flour I used to make the pasta that was so clearly hand made (it was 99 cent boxed pasta from walmart). Or it was clear I used a very particular Pinot Noir for a coq au vin for which I actually just added a little fruit juice with some vodka. Or that the saffron really made a difference in my risotto when I really just used turmeric. Or how the food tastes so much better when sauces are freshly made with raw ingredients when it's really mayonnaise plus ketchup or some other dumb combination of common condiments.\n\nI just smile and nod. A part of me feels guilty, but not guilty enough to go back to making the more authentic versions that they'd just complain about that costs me way more time and money anyways. I'm more just worried that one day they'll find out, but I've gotten away with it for almost eight years now\n\nEdit because so many people have asked: This was my first job as a personal chef and it was a a side gig. When I took the job, I didn't know how much to charge. They asked what would be the price per meal for their family of four, including getting groceries, planning, prepping, cooking, plating, cleaning, etc. So everything, including groceries would be included in what they pay me. So the groceries are a business expense. They don't reimburse me for it. It's part of my total fee. Tbh that fee was vastly under charging for my time and the amount of work I put in initially, as well as the quality of ingredients. Rookie mistake as a rookie cook I guess. \n\nAlso, I don't regularly serve boxed pasta lol. It's just one of the examples off the top of my head",

We rushed down there it was in an area with a large Chinese population and many Chinese stores/grocers etc so figured it would be good. When we got there was lots of Chinese people in there too all speaking Mandarin (I guess I have no idea honestly), took a seat and was each given menus, all sweet and sour, honey bollocks. We said to the waitress hmm do you have a different online menu? We had found some good sounding dishes but can't find them here, she then went and got us the Chinese menus. So much better sounding food. \n\nI got so fed up of the Chinese takeaway standard fare you find around the UK. Having spent time abroad and tasted some fantastic authentic Chinese food I know the stuff we get here is very British Chinese, the same way most \"Indian\" restaurants serve a completely different cuisine to traditional Indian food.",

If your clients like your food made with everyday material and not the expensive ones, they just like the asian food how it's supposed to be... thats my judgment",

Sometimes the foods that wow him the most are peasant foods!  I even recall him discussing that he may prefer fresh wine to classically aged wines.  \n\nAnyways... Good food is a matter of having the right balance.  Fair food is equally tasty and nostalgic as having grandma's chicken soup or ragu.",

The post makes it sound like he's been lying by omission and making up dishes on the fly when it's not the case. \n\n\nAlso keep in mind when you host events you'd need to be wary of allergies and you're planning your menu around that. He's made it possible for his employers to lie to their guests. You're going to an event eating something with saffron in it when it's actually tumeric instead? Fuck that. \n\n\nAnd NO GUESTS have ever caught onto these gross substitutes and mention it to his employers? Ok fine this family has no taste buds but not a single one of their guest can't tell fruit juice from wine? Or saffron from turmeric? I don't believe this story at all.",

I have been a chef my entire professional career and was a private chef for many years.  \n\nThe part that doesn\u2019t sound right, isn\u2019t necessarily the fact that you\u2019ve masked less expensive ingredients for more expensive ones, it\u2019s the examples you gave that are way off base, and make it seem like you\u2019re not a chef at all.\n\nUsing grape juice and vodka isn\u2019t even remotely something you could do as a substitute whatsoever.  It\u2019s not like I have a super refined pallete either\u2014 ANYONE would be able to know that it tastes like shit.  Also your examples of using ketchup \u201cor some other condiment\u201d for sauces is also VERY suspect.  Not to mention 99 cent boxed pasta pass of as handmade\u2014 this literally makes no sense.  Hand made pasta is not extruded pasta, you can simply know that by the shape of pasta relatively widely known\u2014 especially for a rich couple that has travelled.  \n\nalso the amount of time you\u2019re saying it takes to make these dishes.  12 hours?!  Outside of Southern BBQ, and some dishes Asian cuisines, there really aren\u2019t any \u201cdishes\u201d that take 12 hours to make.  Certain ingredients for sure, take a long time to make but those ingredients have literally 0 substitutes and the only way you can actually substitute them is by purchasing it made\u2014 such as Demi-glac\u00e9 or something.\n\nThe real give away with this story is the fact that you said you made something initially and \u201cthey didn\u2019t like it.\u201d  So, how is it that you still got to work for them?  Also, that assumes that the subsequent times you cooked for them slaving over 12 hour dishes they still didn\u2019t like it until you used grape juice instead of wine?  If on my first attempt and/or first few attempts to cook for people, they didn\u2019t like what I served\u2014 I most certainly wouldn\u2019t get the gig.  \n\nThis whole story is entirely suspect. Passing certain dishes off as higher quality with some things that truly aren\u2019t as good as they are doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re making a tomato sauce with ketchup or something.  \n\nSo.. this person either is giving fake examples for a wow factor for the lay person or this is entirely fake\u2014 just saying.",

When you cook off the alcohol you remove most of the subtleties between expensive and cheap wine. I can\u2019t think of any recipes that explicitly call for expensive wine versus cheap wine. It\u2019s better to just drink the expensive wine.\n\nAlso who can afford a personal chef with a \u201cmulti million\u201d dollar home? That\u2019s like\u2026an above average home in many states. It\u2019s not something that means you can afford daily staff. \n\nThis is completely fictional and it\u2019s hilarious how much traction it\u2019s getting.",

    "postText": "Pretty much the title. My son loves his 2DS (We dont allow him to play other gaming systems because of the violence) And we allow him to play a total of 2 hours a week. He gets to choose those hours as long as he keeps his grades above an A minus and always does his chores and doesn't act out of line etc. He's a good kid, he doesn't talk back or act rebellions, he doesn't have many friends and that's mostly because i can't trust if these kids he befriends might offer him a vape or a weed or something else and he is not allowed to talk to girls. I really think i raised him the way god intended until a few weeks ago. I caught him still on his 2ds despite the clock showing he had been playing five minutes past his allotted hour. This filled me with shame because he would normally never do this. I took it from him immediately and told him I was going to sell it. He was crying and saying he forgot to look at the clock but i dont believe him. my wife told me that selling it was going to far and the amount of stress id given him was enough of a punishment, but i went through with it to a) punish him and b) show hiim that a real man always keeps his word. He started avoiding me and then after it sold four days ago he has not said a single word to me. I think that i let him get too independent that he thinks playing past his curfew is ok and now he thinks he can just ignore me. suffice to say i am really po'd by this disrespect. he needs to man up and stop worrying about a stupid game toy. my wife is telling me i messed up and ive been sleeping on the couch lately. im starting to wonder if i couldve handled things better and im not sure where to go from here. how do i teach him that he messed up and he needs to accept that? i am lost.",

Great, now he won't know how to interreact with people. \n\nCan't talk to girls? He's 17 for fuck$ sake. He should have the chance to have a girl friend, or boyfriend, or whatever friend. \n\nOMG! 5 whole minutes? And you sell his 'stupid game toy'? What happens if he gets a B+? Does he get put in a corner? What's the punishment for not taking out the trash by 5pm or whatever? Does he have to scrub out the toilet with his toothbrush? \n\nAll you are doing is making sure he's unequipped to deal with real life and keeping him from growing and becoming his own person.\n\nIn a year from now, you'll be on Reddit wondering why your son left and never looked back once he hit 18.",

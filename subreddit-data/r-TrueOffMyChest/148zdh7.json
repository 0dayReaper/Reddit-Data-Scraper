    "postText": "Sorry if this is incoherent I\u2019m on iPhone and still a bit shaken up from today.\n\nA-little back story, I work in a nursing home as a dietary aide/server. So I\u2019m in charge of giving the residents their meals according to their doctor ordered diets (filed with their name in a big binder) and dietary needs.\n\nI arrived at work today and saw a new resident seated in my section. One whose chart I had seen in the work group chat (we\u2019ll call him Harold for simplicity sake). On Harold\u2019s chart his diet included: thickened liquids (honey consistency), no mixed consistency\u2019s (no curries or chunky soups), and soft (easier to chew foods). I asked my manger if he was Harold and she confirmed it was. I gave him his soup according to the his guidelines and my manager told me he requested water and put a glass in my hand. Thinking about his sheet I asked her \u201chow much thicken up do I put in this to make it honey like\u201d as to which she said there was no need, it was just water. I questioned her as to when she responded it\u2019s fine and ushered me away. I placed down his water and soon he started to heavily cough. I asked one of the nurses on sight to check on him where he said \u201coh he\u2019s fine he was coughing like that yesterday\u201d. I asked him to double check if he was okay\u2026 long story short he wasn\u2019t. Tigger warning\u2026 her had vomited on his plate and was aspirating due to his water being, you guessed it, no thickened.\n\nAfter all the nurses swarmed me asking what happened and I told them I followed my managers orders, she was called down and the only thing she said to me was \u201cmy bad\u201d.\n\nI am so incredibly pissed off because if I followed my own instruction this would\u2019ve have happened and he would\u2019ve been okay. And the same thing happened yesterday, and it took him choking for her to finally realize something was wrong not me questioning her.\n\n\n\nTLDR: Manager made me feed someone the wrong thing resulting in them choking even when I questioned her about it.",

    "postText": "There's been a reoccurring truck in front of my house. The first time it showed up I was at work. My neighbor informed me when I got home that a truck pulled up in front of my house and a guy went to my backyard, and my neighbor said he looked like he was up to no good. And we talked about the situation. This was 3 months ago. And I obviously didn't see the truck. Last night at exactly 1:20AM, I was up late in bed on my phone and had my window and shades open. I heard a truck pull up by my house. I looked out the window and I'm going to assume it was the same truck. It sat there for a good 1 minute, nobody got out the car, nothing happened. And then it drove away fast. The window was tinted so it was very hard to see if anyone was in the car. The scene honestly looked odd and a bit spooky. I started thinking the car drove itself.",

Pull the screws out of the part that sits on the doorframe where the doorknob goes, that the little piece clicks into? Replace them with long sturdy screws. This will make it significantly harder should anyone try to get in through your front door by force.",

    "postText": "I just broke up w my bf. And there was no reason except for the fact that I have nothing to offer . I lay in my bed all day everyday, I can\u2019t even bring myself to text him back. I have no motivation for seeing him at all. Maybe once a week. I love him I do, but I\u2019m in no state to be in a relationship with him if I\u2019m like this. I have no friends here to comfort me, or nobody I can really talk to. I just want to be alone all day and cry, but I can\u2019t even cry. These feelings are too strong and there\u2019s nothing to do but smoke weed. I can\u2019t even get up to pee. What is wrong with me??",

If that boy loves you and is happy to be with you the worst thing you can do is push him away \"we all die alone but we live amongst men\". The biggest things in your life are your friends and family, cutting that lifeline in your time of need is bad.\n\nI think you should call him back and be honest. REALLY honest. Tell him and if he understands and comes back, never let go.",

You don\u2019t even have to scrub or put effort in, just get yourself under hot water, add soap if it seems doable. \n\nThen send your bf this post and let him in so you can have a support system. There\u2019s nothing wrong with you, it sounds like you have depression, which a LOT of people do. You don\u2019t have to be alone, despite what your brain is telling you you deserve.",

So, he tasked someone to make him both happy and sad. \n\nSomeone brought back a ring and it was inscribed with: this too shall pass.\n\nYou will be sad then comes happiness. Then so too comes sadness again. Life is like the tide. It ebbs and flows. I hope you find your rhythm.",

I soon found myself driving 1.5 hours to my moms apartment where she greeted me warmly. I did my best to hang out with her for a bit, but ultimately found my way to her bed and cuddled up on it. I was passed out for 5 hours. \n\nWhen I finally crawled out of bed, she had dinner ready and gave me the biggest hug. \n\nI\u2019m very lucky to have her love. There\u2019s really nothing greater.",

I didn't realise how many people would see this and reply. Also thank you so much for the awards! It really is a powerful and hard hitting quote.\n\nI'm just in on a short break from work at the moment so I don't have time to reply to people, but I will try and work my way through them, a short glance tells me I'm going to be crying. The death of someone we love is heartbreaking and often takes a part of us with them, and although that part can't be replaced, we can grow new parts of who are and they will love us for that.\n\nTake care of yourselves and each other and know they you're still loved \ud83d\udc9c",

Honestly, I don't feel like the grief ever really goes away or ever becomes any less strong than it was when she died. I just feel like I learned how to cope better with it. But I really don't want it to get easier so to speak or for the grief to become less strong. I heard this before that grief is just love that has nowhere to go, and it just tells me how much I love my mom. I'm sorry you lost your mom as young as you did because I know how you feel. Sending hugs and good vibes from over the internet.",

My mom died 5 years ago and this was the first year I didn\u2019t cry on special days or when I visited the cemetery, and I\u2019m almost 58. There\u2019s this post that floats around Reddit about grief and it\u2019s so true. I have pasted it below for you. I can\u2019t remember the name of the Redditor who originally wrote it. I pasted it below. \n\n\u201cAs for grief, you\u2019ll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you\u2019re drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it\u2019s some physical thing. Maybe it\u2019s a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it\u2019s a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\u00a0\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don\u2019t even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you\u2019ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what\u2019s going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything\u2026and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\nSomewhere down the line, and it\u2019s different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O\u2019Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you\u2019ll come out.\n\u00a0\nTake it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don\u2019t really want them to. But you learn that you\u2019ll survive them. And other waves will come. And you\u2019ll survive them too. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\u201d",

My Dad died two months ago and his service is this weekend (All 5 of us kids live in different states so we needed time to be financially able to come together again). This past week I have been drowning in grief, knowing that this weekend means its real. Its over. He's gone and I'll never hear him laugh again. He'll never call me Baby Girl again. I'm 31 and I'd give a lot just to see him smile again. Watching him die was one of the hardest things I've ever done and this week has felt like I'm witnessing it all over again. \n\nSorry. I'm sorry. \n\nThank you for the words.",

I lost my sweet Mom earlier this year, and am having a hard time navigating my life without her.\n\nWe are lucky to have such loving mothers...there really is nothing greater.  Cherish your mom, create lots of good memories together and always tell her how much you love her and what a great mother she is.   I've always done this, and now that my mom is gone, I have great memories of time spent, and I find comfort in knowing she knew how much I loved her and what she meant to me.\n\nOP, thank you for sharing this moment with us.",

There are small triggers that will just set my brothers and I off. A song on the radio, a smell, a sunset, whatever. It used to be so tough (and it still is on occasion), but now we can find beauty in the small things we remember her by. The tears we shed don\u2019t always have to be of grievance, but rather remembrance, appreciation, and love. \n\nI love seeing posts like this. I have so many great friends that have terrible parents. I may have lost her while she was too young, but I had the best mom for 11 years. I consider myself lucky.",

I\u2019ve always been a cuddler with my momma and at 32 still will cozy up under a blanket with her to watch a movie. We\u2019ve only gotten closer since I had my son and losing her would be the second worst devastating loss I could go through. Top being my baby of course. And then there\u2019s my dad who\u2019s 15 yrs older than her, already in his 70s with heart trouble. I know there will be some very bleak days in the future so I try to make sure they know how much I love them now. I make little lists and notes for my son for us to either look back on together or so that he has that link to me should I move beyond.

So I know just what you mean about how deeply you still (and will always) miss her.\n\nSimilarly, we had an ongoing gag with a quote from the old movie, the Bad Seed. Whenever I was trying to butter her up before asking for something (I think originally it was letting me have a 'skip day' during my senior year of high school) I'd quote the problematic little girl, Rhoda, from the movie and stroke my mom's arm while saying sinisterly, \"I've got the prettiest mother. I've got the nicest mother.\u00a0I tell everybody that...\" It was a silly joke between us that I haven't thought about in a long time.\n\nYour story reminded me of that. And it's a reminder for both of us that, as much as we miss them, we are lucky to have great memories from moments with great moms that can still put a smile on our faces 20+ years later. \u2665\ufe0f",

It\u2019ll mean so much to her and you may be surprised at how it\u2019ll make you feel better.\n\nOne day, hopefully in the very far future, you\u2019ll look back and you don\u2019t want this to be something you think about, thinking of how you should\u2019ve called more, texted more, stopped in more. I thought I would\u2019ve had more time. I never thought she would\u2019ve died when I was 24, but she did. One day, there was no more time... Only memories. But I\u2019m thankful for the times I had with her, and I do wish I had called her more, but I was in my early 20s thinking I had most of my life left with her (luckily, I didn\u2019t move out of my parents\u2019 house until I was 21, so I did have a lot of time with her). We always think we have more time, and some do! Yet, others don\u2019t.  I had 24 years with that wonderful woman, and I\u2019ve gone 22 years without her and not a week goes by that I don\u2019t think about her.\n\nSo call your mom once a week. Start there. Pick a time and day each week and just call. Even if it\u2019s for 3 minutes. Shoot the shit with her. Let her get to know the adult you! Build upon your relationship with her. She won\u2019t be here forever. \n\nCall your mom. \u2764\ufe0f",

Whether that be through social services, fostering, working in a home, counselling etc. My dream was always to get the biggest house possible and take in as many kids as I could and give them the happy, caring, supportive and loving home and family that they deserve. Obviously as an adult, I know now that it wouldn't have worked out that way, as I had planned, (big mansion full of fun lol) but I'd have definitely given it a good go!

A lot of details are in my post history if you're ever morbidly curious. \n\nIt was a lot of things like restricting food even though I was pretty underweight, Healthcare was only for things that were very serious or affected my ability to play sports and sleep was heavily restricted. Crying was not directly punished but I was yelled at as a kid for example if I cried while my adoptive mother brushed out my curls. She would always start from the top of my head and rip the brush through. Incredibly painful.  Though as a teen I had to hide if I cried. She would get up in my face and scream at me otherwise. \n\nLot of name calling, whore, weed picker cause I pulled at my skin when I was nervous etc. Anything about me physically that was not up to beauty standards were heavily scrutinized in acne etc. I got called a slut when I came back from college cause I was not a size 0 anymore. I was finally a healthy weight at that point as i had put on maybe 20-25 lbs which at 5 feet tall is a lot. I was a size 3 in us sizes at that point. Hardly fat. \n\nAlways drama, well into my college years it would be phone calls with just random \"why do you hate me?\" Out of the blue, or \"your boyfriend cheats on you I know it.\" Etc. Constant drama, screaming etc. She once tried to prevent me from leaving their house at the age 20. I just wanted to head back to school and she got in my way, grabbed me, threw herself in my car etc. \n\nMy father has always been the lesser evil. I was really close to him up until about 1.5 years ago. He would often be the one to put my mother into her place growing up.  But he was the loud one. He would throw things, scream, spanking was okay, I vaguely remember being belted once by him probably around 9 or so. I recently remembered he would grab the back of my neck sometimes and walk me around like that. \n\nWhen he was in a good mood though? Great. He was the intelligent one so he was always glad to help with my homework, loved watching movies, would complain about my mother but tell me this all helped build my character etc.\n\nHe did once ignore my existence for a week when I was in hs. I was 18 and threw my cross country race for state qualifying, as in I jogged it. I was fed up with my coach and his constant abuse. I knew what my mother was and the coach was the same. \n\nMy father did not forgive me. Acted like he heard nothing if I spoke, would not look at me. Would move around me as if he was not blocked but would never touch me. His anger was silent until it wasn't. \n\nTheir daughter, has all the qualities of her mother just more violent. Thank God I was the bigger child growing up even though she was 5 years older. I learned pretty young to make myself look bigger and scarier than I am. I was incredibly small but I was the larger of us two.",

My father passed away in 2015 from a cirrhotic liver from a life of drinking before I was born (the drinking that is). He was a treasure trove of wisdom and interesting stories from a life rife with mistakes and lived experiences. Unfortunately he was almost never present and he was also very close minded, verbally abusive at times and towards the end of his life, a little creepy and pervy.\n\nMy mother is the archetypal devouring mother. Toxic, overbearing, emotionally manipulative, judgmental, overly critical. Verbally and emotionally abusive when you don\u2019t go her way. I\u2019m in my mid 30\u2019s and I\u2019m barely getting to the point where I recognize these things and have begun cutting her off.\n\nI now have my own little family with my wife and our beautiful 2yr old little girl. If all my parents taught me was how *not* to be and what *not* to do, then I\u2019ll do and be the opposite for my little girl and break those vicious cycles. All of this to say, it makes me happy when other people have healthy relationships with their parents. It gives me hope that I might be a good father to my daughter, and perhaps provide her the healthy relationship that my dad didn\u2019t know to give me.",

Very often, mostly on difficult days emotionally and physically (I have chronic illnesses and pain), I wish I could just fly to Miami and see her. I miss her hugs and I miss her running her fingers through my hair while I cry. Afterwards, I always felt like things would be okay. It\u2019s hard living on opposite sides of the country, but I talk to her daily and do my best to visit when I can. She also will come visit me on her own whenever she has the time just to check up on me. Damn, I really miss her right now. I am so freaking lucky to have her.",

But I\u2019m my case, and I\u2019m certain many others, our grief does not take a healthy path, the losses we suffer continue to linger inside us, mine were like pieces of glass in my heart, I did not realize it hurt with every breath, it grew and grew and affected every part of my life, heavier and heavier. Please if you may be dealing with death and loss in a way that is unhealthy, reach out to someone, there are grief groups everywhere and they are something I cannot understate value on.

    "postText": "I 21F am a college student that suffers from alopecia and a rare skin condition called solar urticaria. For those that don't know what either are, alopecia is a condition that causes me to spontaneously lose patches of my hair and solar urticaria causes me to break out into hives and welys whenever my skin gets exposure to the sun.I made the brave decision of shaving my head last year due to my alopecia because I would have a breakdown whenever I had one of my flare ups. It was a very hard decision for me and I missed having hair. I tried different treatments and even wore wigs, but my skin had a bad reaction to one of the wig glues that I used and I ended up getting a skin infection. I had to take tetracycline to treat it which my body also had a very negative reaction to and as a result, I developed solar urticaria.   \nSolar urticaria is a very rare and very painful disease and there's unfortunatley no cure (talk about bad luck). I am still taking treatments for both conditions although I am notably staying away from wigs. I had no problem rocking the bald look after the wig fiasco, but after being diagnosed with solar urticaria, the lack of hair on my head became a problem due to there being no protection for my scalp. I was coming up with ways to appease my solar urticaria because dealing with the symptoms were not fun. So I began to wear long sleeve shirts and pants, and I would apply heay amounts of sunscreen, and I would take the medication that my doctor prescirbed. I also started to wear scarves on my head.  \nWhen I first started wearing my scarves, I had trouble keeping them on my head, so I started watching hijab tutorials on Youtube and I got pretty good at wearing them. I would like to clarify that I am not Muslim, I just used the hijab tutorials to help me wear my scarves better. The trouble started when one of my classmates who is Muslim invited me to join out school's Muslim Student Union. I then told her that I wasn't actually Muslim I just covered myself from head-to-toe for medical reasons. This offended my classmate and she said that I was making a mockery of her religion, and how dare I wear the hijab for slefish purposes.  \nThat's why I came here to Reddit. I had no intention of mocking the religion. I just wanted to make my quality of life more bearable. I have had less solar urticaria flareups due to the scarves, but I had no clue that what I was doing could actually be deemed offensive. However I may be the asshole in this situation since I never bothered to research if what I am doing is okay. I really dont' want to stop wearing my scarves because my life has became so much easier, but I'm now public enemy number 1 to all the muslims at my college and I don't know what to do.",

She looks amazing in them. She buys them from a company owned by Hasidic Jewish women, and they have a huge list on their website of reasons why people cover their heads with fabric or wraps - all religious reasons including Christian and Pagan reasons, illness, early baldness, taking back their bodies after trauma, sun sensitivity\u2026 the whole lot. \n\nLet her be mad. You\u2019re not Islamophobic or an enemy of a whole religion for protecting your skin.",

There is not a single teaching in Islam that says \u201cstop those who aren\u2019t Muslim from wearing a headscarf\u201d. Further to that, there is a difference between a hijab and a headscarf, where a hijab represents a veil of modesty (of sorts) while a headscarf is the literal cloth that covers the hair so your classmate is clearly misinformed about the fact that they aren\u2019t the same. Your intention was not to be Islamophobic but to find a way to ease your symptoms. No one should dictate how you dress and be offended, especially when there\u2019s absolutely no reason. \n\nI would recommend maybe speaking to a teacher or the college counsellor as the way they are treating you is ridiculous and a horrible representation of Muslims everywhere. I hope things get better for you - please don\u2019t stop wearing the headscarf and dressing the way you do if you feel like it\u2019s helping you! \ud83e\udd0d",

When folks round-about inquire I just say mmm-hmmm. If they ask directly about a particular religion, I just say 'I am not of that particular faith' and then immediately change the subject or walk away.\n\nPeople really need to mind the business that pays them, and in turn, people need to really learn it pays you no quarter to explain your business to strangers.

The girls in your college are bullies they have no right dictate what you do or do not wear. The problem isn\u2019t Islam the problem is they\u2019re bullies. If they continue to harass you speak to the a senior member of staff. You do not have to justify what you wear to anyone.",

What the other person did was offensive and has absolutely nothing to do with the Islamic teaching. Hijab \"as some may want to call it\" is just a way to dress to show modesty... a lot of Christians and Jewish people wear it with pride as a form faith practice. some do it all the time, some on religious occasions. So please don't let poeple's ignorence bother u. She was just an AH  and a disgrace to the faith she claims to belong to. \nAll humans are equal in the eyes of god and everyone is free to do what he wants and dress as he wishes with or regardless of his faith or health problems. That said, i am sorry you have to go through all of that and i wish you get soon better. And remember that with all what you're going through at least you're not an AH, so keep the smile and get better soon \u263a\ufe0f",

Some of it is even very fashionable and not just super tight yoga stuff.\n\nI highly recommend you look into [Sun Sleeves](https://www.rei.com/product/203635/rei-co-op-active-pursuits-sun-sleeves). They also sell them for your legs. They act as SPF 50+ and easily fit with shorts and t-shirts. Even short shorts. Though, they're not going to work for a tank top.\n\nI have worn these while biking across hot dry deserts in the southwest as well as in stupid hot and humid conditions in the southeast. They breath very well and they keep me from getting even a little red despite being one of the palest people you will ever meet.\n\nYou can easily take them off and put them on when going from outside to in or inside to out.\n\nI hate slathering myself in sunscreen every day, but I love the outdoors. These, and other items like them, let me enjoy the hell out of the summer without worrying about applying sunscreen every few hours and while being very active.",

What offends you might not offend others and something you deem innocent could start a riot on the other side of the planet.  \n\nYou can't double guess yourself with every breath you take. If people get offended, let them. It's their problem to deal with, it's the choice they made for themselves. They've decided to be upset over something trivial.  \nEven if you were voluntarily insulting, their behaviour is theirs to control, and it's only up to them to deal with whatever situation they are facing.  \n\nSaying \"I'm offended\" is meaningless. It doesn't do anything, it doesn't justify any action made after, it doesn't mean rights were infringed, or laws broken.  \nSaying \"I'm offended\" is the equivalent of saying \"I can't deal with this situation, you need to worry about how **I** feel and you need to cater to **my** whim and needs, regardless of your own feelings\".  \nIt says \"I'm more important than you\".  \n\nThis goes for any belief - religious or not - anywhere, anytime.  \n\nPeople are offended?  \n\nFuck 'em.

If she had any sort of sense, she would know that it is a head covering, and it is not something that is the icon of Islam. If you walk into the middle east, you would see people from all religions wearing a headscarf/head covering. Nuns for instance, wear head coverings for modesty reasons as well as establishing their occupation.   \n\n\nThis girl needs some serious re-educating, and she needs to stop gate keeping. Headscarves are not something to hinder other people from wearing, for any reason. Ever. This is extremely inappropriate behavior coming from her, and if this classmate continues to be rude, then please report her, because this is literal discrimination. This is extremely vile and inappropriate behavior, and I'm very sorry you experienced this.   \n\n\nI'm wishing you all the best, and also I would like to recommend silk scarves, as they help to keep the head cool as well as being thin enough to prevent moisture and humidity. They're just all round great. &lt;3",

    "postText": "For most of my life I have been a good guy, moral, respectful, not aggressive. I would ask women on dates instead of making moves, I never slept with women on the first date and was only interested in serious relationships.\n\nA few months ago, I got sick of this getting me nowhere, I could see that everyone my age was sleeping around and not taking things seriously. I decided to change things up and be more a player, casually date, make moves early, sleep with women early on and so on.\n\nAnd I am sort of disappointed because that worked wonders. Instead of asking women on dates, I would simply make it obvious I was interested in hooking up and see if they were down. I even got it down to a tee, if I was out and met a girl I liked, I'd try to create some alone time to chat with her one on one for a bit then at some point when emotions were high and I thought she was into me, I'd take her hand and say, \"Look, honestly I think your hot and all I've thinking about is kissing you, can I kiss you right now?\".\n\nIt's fast efficient, I figure out there and then if she is actually interested in me and after a few times I stopped caring about the outcome. Most of the time women agree and we get together.\n\nAnd every time I am thinking, what the fuck, this is supposed to be more difficult. I think I built all these stages up to dating before that were unrealistic, it's not anything more than two people who like each other getting together. So if we are both adults, lets just put it out there and see if they are into it.\n\nIdk why I needed to say this, I guess it's just good to feel like I have finally figured it out after all this time.",

And are you getting it?\n\nIf you want to hook up without strings, then acting like you want a relationship is not going to help. Asking women if they want to hook up will.\n\nIf you want a long term, committed relationship, acting like you want to hook up without strings is not going to help.  Taking the slow approach and being kind and understanding will.\n\nIt\u2019s all about the desired outcome.  If you try to get a long term relationship with someone who wants to just have some fun, you\u2019re going to be disappointed. And if you try to hook up with someone who wants a long term relationship, you\u2019re going to be disappointed.  But if you try to be with someone who wants what you want?  Yeah, it\u2019s going to be easy.",

You\u2019re just hooking up. \n\nOr did you just pretend that you wanted a serious relationship when all you really wanted was to hook up? No surprise that didn\u2019t work then. Why would a girl that\u2019s looking for a hook up be attracted to a guy saying he wants a serious relationship? \n\nAnd all the girls that wanted a serious relationship saw the NiceGuy red flag and realised you were just pretending. \n\nNow you\u2019re telling the girls that you\u2019re just looking to hook up and the ones that also want that react to that. \n\nIf you really want a relationship though this is still getting you nowhere.",

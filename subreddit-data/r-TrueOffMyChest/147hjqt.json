    "postText": "I (19f) laughed when my harasser (68M) killed himself. To put it in perspective my grandma met this man when I was around 5-6 years old after my grandfather passed in 2007. My harasser, was a wonderful man, till I turned about 8. When I turned 8 is when the abuse truly started. He told me on multiple occasions it was because he loved me and all \u201cgrandfathers\u201d did this with their granddaughters and it was normal. So I never mentioned it. This lasted until I was 13. 5 years of this. My mom left me alone with him because Yk she trusted him, at some point we lived with him and me and my sister slept in HIS ROOM which was even worse. So when I turned 13 I finally decided enough was enough and told my mom. She didn\u2019t believe me and sent me to live with my father, who lived about 3 hours away, and she told my whole family not to believe me. My father and step mom did believe me and sent me to therapy. When I turned 17-18 we were all at the dinner table and my step mom mentioned my cousins daughter \u201chow is (cousins kid) doing now that she can\u2019t see her grandfather\u201d I just said \u201cI wouldn\u2019t doubt she can\u2019t see him he\u2019s a rapist\u201d \u201cNo (me) he killed himself two days ago\u201d I laughed, I bursted out in laughter and told my parents he deserved it. They called me multiple names and told me I shouldn\u2019t have laughed, even after all I told my therapist, even after she told them I WAS OM FACT SA\u2019D, they get mad at me that I laughed? He probably couldn\u2019t have handled the guilt. I just hope to GOD he never touched that little girl. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s gone and I\u2019m glad he\u2019ll never hurt another soul the way he hurt me and my family.",

You don't owe that man sympathy and as one of his victims, you don't have to apologize for how you reacted. Congratulations on finally being free of him!\n\nP.s. I'm gonna share a little fact that really comforted me: the cells in your body are constantly dying and regenerating. It takes about 7 years for all your cells to completely replace themselves, so pretty soon, you're going to have a body that has never ever been touched by him.",

But I got raped for years. Butyou know he so handsome he so charming everyone is infatuated with him he could belt me publicly and everyone say poor you hacking a tough teen daughter to deal with hit her harder and he could make a joke and everyone would laugh. He normalised sexual behaviour towards me and physical abuse. It\u2019s was normalised then encouraged by other adults round me. I my father could groom anyone. Especially desperate woman. But also men who that he was the bees knees\n\nI will laugh when he dies\n\nI made police report. The police woman \u2026. Was his biggest fan oh I remember you from back in the day. Bla bla She wa completely Infatuated too. The family were furious about telling tehnolice. Keep it in the family. We will deal with it. We will beat him up.

Shame on your mom and the rest of that side of the family for refusing to believe you and I am so happy your dad and stepmom believed you and got you help.

This one time he came by our house I was 12 and still had those repeated nightmares of him and I couldn't look him in the eyes. He made everyday awful whenever he used to visit and I'd cry to my mom to not get out of the room. I have ptsd reflexes every time a guy gets closer to me and it has been getting to me lately. Fast forward to covid I found out he died in the age of late twenties. To my surprise I wasn't sad rather than happy that he deserved it and later told to my mom about him. She was too stunned to speak and comforted me telling I should've said it way earlier.",

If the world is now a better place because they're no longer in it, we should acknowledge that.  Failing to do so dishonors all the people they harmed.  \n\nPoint out to them that the Unabomber just died.  Ask if we should honor them, say nice things about his life?

That's some kind of poetic justice there.\n\nIt's not fair of anyone to tell you how you should process or react to the things that happened to you. If you laughed, then you laughed. It's how you felt and I think you are far from the only one who has felt positive emotions when someone who abused them has died.\n\nI think the reality is that people feel uncomfortable with the idea of speaking ill of the dead. You can be the biggest asshole that everyone hated you but you die and people feel guilty to say anything mean about you right away. Very weird thing culturally. To me, it's stupid. If you were an asshole, people should be able to call you an asshole. It's not going to throw some juju off and bringing bad luck. His ghost isn't going to haunt you if you say terrible things about him, you know? \n\nIt feels disrespectful that they expect *you* to feel mournful or respectful of him. Why would you? He showed you none of that respect when he was alive so why give it where it's not warranted? That's a shitty thing to expect from someone so young and so traumatized by what they were forced to endure. It would be great if everyone had the ability to forgive and be infinitely perfect like Jesus of Nazareth but even Jesus wanted to know why the fuck his dad let him get nailed to a cross, you know?\n\nI would say continue to talk through what you feel with people you feel like you can be honest with even if that's only your therapist. You have a right to feel how you feel. I hope knowing he's gone provides some kind of peace for you and that you heal and grow toward the light. Wishing you the best...",

How could someone do that to a little girl? But I was pleasantly surprised when they told me my abuser was never allowed (under the law) to contact me or my biological siblings again. I wouldn\u2019t say that I would be sad if they ever passed away. I don\u2019t blame you for being happy about it. \n\nHope you\u2019re healing okay \u2764\ufe0f",

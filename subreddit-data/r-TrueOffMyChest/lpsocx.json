She was crossing the road and someone made a left and hit her and drove away. \n\nThe people inside the Tim Horton\u2019s saw, didn\u2019t come out to help, instead made a small little video and then mot long after a second vehicle came and ran over her because it\u2019s an ill lit corner and making a left obstructed their view of her. \n\nThe second guy got out and attempted to perform CPR and then was almost charged with manslaughter because nobody inside would come out and help or say anything. It wasn\u2019t until days later when they were looking at the security footage, they realized others were there to witness and that\u2019s when they all were like yeah we saw and recorded and he wasn\u2019t the first one to hit her. Thankfully they also located the first driver who hit her.\n\nEDIT: [I went to google the story to show everyone and the SAME thing happened at the SAME intersection again last month](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/beta.ctvnews.ca/local/barrie/2021/1/23/1_5279698.html) thank fully this lady survived omg\n\nEDIT 2: [I found the original incident which doesn\u2019t doesn\u2019t say much about the double hit she took but it does tell you about people posting about it on Facebook smh](https://www.barrietoday.com/local-news/crash-closes-part-of-holland-street-in-bradford-1101344)",

The problem here is that, with so many people available to help, everyone assumes that someone else, presumably with better capabilities or knowledge, will step in and take the responsibility, even when no such person is around. In this day and age, it's getting harder and harder to imagine being the only witness or the only one who can help. It's a problem of population size and it affects human empathy. \n\nThere's an article on the front page of r/science right now discussing the phenomenon of \"[the more people die, the less we care](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/lpte4z/til_about_a_psychological_phenomenon_known_as/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb)\" and this also ties into population size and empathy.\n\nEvery time I bring this up in conversation I seem to strike a nerve, so please take it with a grain of salt, but... in my opinion, there's an unstudied social limit on population density, beyond which point our brains aren't wired to handle relationships. I'm always reminded of the [Rat Utopia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_sink) experiments preformed by John B. Calhoun in the 70's. We aren't rats, I get it, but we are a social species and we use rats for the basis of MANY studies that we project into our own societies, and even though there was more than adequate housing, food and water available to the rats, the social order crumbled long before they reached their maximum capacity and the resulting \"behavioral sink\" caused the population to dwindle towards extinction irrevocably.\n\nNone of this is to excuse our lack of empathy. I fear that if we lose that, we'll lose everything that holds our civilization together and I don't want to be a part of a society like that, but everything seems to indicate that we're on a dangerous path and I NEED to see some effort being put into researching solutions. Human psychology is far, far more complicated than we give it credit for and there is SO MUCH that we have left to learn... but nobody is funding that.",

Being an actual doctor will relieve you of most of the legal side of things, but anything lower than a doctor and things get...iffy. I'm a paramedic, I work under a physicians license when I'm on duty and I don't have that protection off duty. I also don't expect good samaritan laws to cover me on anything past CPR.",

I saw a guy on a bike get hit by a car going 50 mph right in front of me one time. I wonder what people waiting in the traffic it caused were thinking without knowing this guy probably died (I don't know if he did but it wasn't good).\n\nEven if the traffic is just because of construction, be grateful that the construction is happening at all. A lot of parts of the world have terrible roads, plus, if traffic was moving but the roads were shit, people would be bitching about that instead.\n\nFurther thoughts of traffic/driving...\n\nThe frustration of driving is a great opportunity to practice letting go of anger. There is literally nothing you can do and its partly your fault for being there at all. You share as much responsibility as every other car on the road. This is also true of someone tailgating you or driving slow in front of you. You can flip out, or you can use it as an exercise in acceptance. I used to drive 4-5 hours a day for work, usually in heavy traffic and stressed out, and when I started viewing it that way, I saw a substantial improvement in my general ability to let things pass in other parts of my life without getting worked up.",

Two days later at work one of my coworkers was complaining about being stuck in the *worst* traffic he\u2019d ever seen in that stretch of highway.

Certain restrictions do apply when filming interactions with the police (arrests, protests, etc) that I honestly cannot fully explain to you (I\u2019m not a lawyer and they\u2019re quite complex, eg. there\u2019s a difference between filming something to be used in a court and publishing something you filmed on social media).

It took about 30 minutes, unless someone went off the road in the snow. In that case, it could take anywhere from 1-4 hours because nearly every person would slow down as they passed and take pictures or just gawk at the wreck. I believe people think \u201cI just took a few seconds\u201d but those few seconds add up to hours for the people in back. This happened all the time because people think they can drive without snow tires. Drives me crazy.",

The big ones usually whey around 18t.\n\n\nSo when a normal car hits those it's more like a small rock against a concrete wall.",

A truck with a boat was trying to get across the median/oncoming traffic to get onto a dirt road. They weren\u2019t quick enough and an oncoming sedan t-boned their boat which pushed the truck off the road and it rolled into the ditch. At least 6 other vehicles had stopped to help before we pulled up, but it wasn\u2019t until we stopped and actually got over there did we realize that most of the people were just standing around and not actually helping, no one had even called 911 at that time, so I did. \n\nA couple people went to check on the people in the sedan (4 adults, varying injuries) so we went over to the truck. The dad had crawled out the window (couple bruises but okay) but said his kids were stuck in the back. My boyfriend and his brother are construction workers and always have steel toed shoes on so they wasted no time kicking out the back window to get the kids. They ended up being the most fine out of everyone. \n\nWhen the police and paramedics got there of course everyone rushed them and tried telling them what happened all at the same time and were giving them varying details that either weren\u2019t helpful or important at all, it was a mess. It was eventually sorted out, the sedan family were all taken to hospital, truck dad got a ticket for crossing when it was unsafe. Luckily everyone ended up being okay.",

In dangerous situations I would want you to stay well away in a safe position. But in safe circumstances Just talking to somebody and letting them know help is on the way can be massively reassuring for somebody. Just getting some information from that person e.g what has happened ? Name , age etc. can help us when we first arrive on scene whilst we are gathering information.   In most cases what normally happens when we turn up is we'll politely let you know that your assistance is no longer needed and to move away but THANK YOU!",

Prompt bystander compressions-only CPR, AED use, and basic hemorrhage control are the main lay interventions (besides calling 911) that save lives. Also Narcan and knowing how to stab someone with their own epipen, but I think they've started covering that in some CPR classes now too.",

(I used to think this way, too.)\n\nThere are a lot of simple things you can do to help an injured person - just being with them, talking to them, letting them know that help is on the way, assisting them in moving to a more comfortable position if they can't do so themselves, putting pressure on an obviously heavily bleeding wound, etc.\n\nThe average person isn't trained in first aid the way an EMT is, and nobody is expecting you to overshoot your knowledge and try to be one. Just try your best to be kind, compassionate, to talk and listen, assist, and use your common sense to help and not try to do anything super crazy. You will help the situation 99% of the time.

Around the holidays this past year, a house fire happened where two kids and their dad were able to get out. A third kid was trapped in the attic. Once firefighters and everyone got on scene, they knew the kid was gone. The house was tiny and borderline hoarders situation so it was engulfed in minutes. Well, some jerk decided to cut through the bushes to get a photo of it even though the area was blocked off. They yelled at him to get back (safety reasons) but what that idiot didn't know is, the tarp on the front porch was covering the dead burned body of the 3 year old.\n\nNaturally, the idiot shared the photo with all the local news stations so everywhere on social media people liked and shared a post that shows a tarp with a dead 3 year old under it. You wouldn't know this unless you knew someone who helped on scene which makes it even worse.\n\nSo frustrating. People don't think.",

My brother was laying on the concrete with a broken back, my sister was in hysterics, and I was dealing with a broken neck, and while we were waiting for an EMT our uncle or whoever started taking a video of everything on his phone. I had no idea, probably due to the shock and adrenaline, until my brother told me he remembered moaning in pain and looking up and seeing a camera pointed right towards him. He then flipped off our uncle and family, And he was like 15 when that happened. Just put the cameras away people. it\u2019s fucking annoying",

The day is bad enough without it ending up on social media to be immortalized and made so everyone can see it. So everyone can have a comment on it. So they can speculate what caused it, who's to blame, pick apart everything rescue crews are doing (and play armchair expert and say \"Well, acktually, they did &lt;this thing&gt; wrong...\").\n\nAnd even for police involved in some kind of situation. Most times that footage makes situations seem worse or takes it out of context. It only shows part of the story. Like, for example, not the minutes leading up to it where you see the person decide punching the officer is a good idea. You only see the person getting pushed to the ground and cuffed. And then suddenly it's abuse of power or police harassment or whatever. Which is a disservice to everyone as it fosters distrust and hate towards a group that despite flaws does actually work to protect us. (And yes they do care. Otherwise they wouldn't do it.)",

    "postText": "I made an alt for this, don't want the risk of anyone I know finding it. Content warnings, nothing overly sexual but still mentions of shitty things.\n\nSorry for the long post, haha, lots to talk about.\n\nFrom the ages of about 12-15 I used an app called Amino, joining communities focused on writing and art. I joined it because I had difficulties making friends in secondary, along with being just weird, I am autistic- undiagnosed at the time. \n\nI'll leave out the specific server I was apart of, but ot was centred around role-playing. I would create ocs to act as, which helped me speak to more people without the fears of /normal/ social interaction, and through this I made many friends, where in real-life I had none.\n\nThis is where the problems began. When I was around 13 I joined a group within the server specifically for writing and sharing our writings, at the time I made really edgy poetry as a way to vent. Here the leader of this group tool a particular liking to me.\n\nShe was far older than me, older than most of the people I would talk to on the app. She never told me specifically but I knew it had to be above the age of 21, since she could buy alcohol in America. She knew I was 13.\n\nI don't want to get too much into it, but she made me feel special. Thinking back, the entire group was a bit too overly sexual for what should have been acceptable on the app, my time in the role-playing server had never lead to something like this. Ultimately it corrupted the way I thought was acceptable for older people to talk to me on the Internet, I thought it was just fine whenever sexual jokes were made around or about me, I should have just left that group.\n\nThe leader of the group ended up confessing her love to me, I had confessed to her previously that I was questioning my sexuality, and at the time I thought I was a lesbian (I'm now a dude lol). Thankfully I didn't accept her confession, I think I just felt more awkward more than anything, but what scares me the most to this day is that I saw nothing wrong with what she had said. I didn't see any issue with her being almost a decade older than me. I think a large part of it is because of that damned group I was a part of.\n\nFrom then on she grew distant from me, almost cutting me off- as if it was a punishment? The entire group segmented from there, and I felt utterly alone again.\n\nThen I started seeking the same validation from other people online, which just left me open for more and more older creeps. Whenever I was talking to one of these people I seemed to just mold myself however they wanted, just letting them have what they wanted with me- a literal child. They all knew I was underage while doing very explicit things with me over text, luckily I had some sense as to not share my real name, location, or even pictures of myself (I adopted a new /persona/ for each person, how cringe is that  haha).\n\nI came to realise recently that this wasn't Al that normal (no shit), and has had a great impact for my real-life relationships since then, as I have found myself still molding who I am to suit the person I am talking to- which has lead to some uncomfortable sexual situations, luckily I did not get hurt in any of them!! Yahoo!\n\nBut, yes, I now find myself struggling to form any romantic/closer relationships with people, always slipping into giving people what they want and becoming afraid of them, of myself, in the process. This has all lead to me being very afraid, even at 18, I'm still afraid.\n\nI just don't know what to do, I want to tell people, I want to confide in people but I'll just be a burden to them. How do I tell my parents? They'll probably just blame themselves for not checking my phone more often. My friends don't need to be trauma dumped on (that's what you lot are for &lt;3).\n\nAnyways, uh, thanks for reading if you made it all the way through. Writing this all down was a little bit of a relief, even if I left out a few major events (still ended up being a bloody essay).\n\nIf anyone recognises me, or my writing style, from this: either you're my friend and aaaa go away; or you're one of the weirdos, if so, fuck you.",

Creating a persona to fit in, isnt being comfortable with who you are. You need to explore you likes, dislikes, how you relate to others...basically find yourself, before looking for a relationship.",

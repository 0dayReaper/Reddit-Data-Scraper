I wake up pretty thirsty and bloated though, lol.\n\nUPDATE: I'm going to pull this off again sometime in the next couple days. I'll try to document it with some pictures of all the glory!!!!\n\n[UPDATE 2 with pics!!!](https://imgur.com/a/XWDRRam)\n\nI ordered a large pizza tonight instead of a medium because of a coupon, but I went with the thin crust. I like regular crust wayyy better!!! After I polished off the 8 hot wings, I had to tap out after 4.5 pizzas..I was just too full. Anyways, thanks for all the love :)\n\nProbably won't be doing many more of these, but, glad some of you enjoyed partaking in my secret plate night indulgences. \n\nLove yourself. Choose to be happy. Even if it means not sharing with your wife :)",

As a teenager I was a binge eater, when you are hiding food or associating it with negative emotions its unhealthy. It leads to future shame and negativity; lets say his wife catches him in the act, what emotions would they feel? Guilt, Shame, Anger? All are viable and all are destructive to your relationship to yourself, to food and to their partner. \n\nI went from being overweight to restriction, to binge eating, purging these negative experiences eventually and leading to further restrictive eating. You want control over your body and your inability to control yourself, so you think I will not eat from this time to this time, or I will only eat 500 calories today. Your body starts eating yourself and you feel you have no energy but your now at a full blown eating disorder so you only see yourself as fat.",

I wanna live long and as healthy as I can. A medium pizza is only six small slices (nearly only one bite size) but still can't see this going on forever, lol I'll probably get sick of it before I get caught. \n\nBut reflecting on my first real father's day, I felt like my secret was such a (young) dad thing to do and wanted to share my little secret.",

It's coming from a gluttonous place and a nostalgic indulgence from when I was single, lol, and I ate whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. \n\nIf she were to catch me, she'd honestly just make fun of the situation and probably laugh her ass off, and turn it into another inside joke, lol.",

Also, be mindful that the meal you\u2019re describing has over 3,000 calories. That means each time you do this, you gain about 400 g (0.9 lb) of body fat.  \nThat means at the end of one year, you\u2019d weigh roughly 7.5 kg (16.5 lbs) more than you would if you hadn\u2019t binged but kept everything else the same. At the end of 5 years, you would weigh about 40 kg (90 lb) more than you would if you hadn\u2019t binged but kept everything else the same.\nYou may want to work on dropping this habit. And if you are unable, maybe look for some therapy to explore why you feel the need to binge eat.  \nAnyway, that\u2019s my thoughts on it. Not trying to be negative. You live your life. But it\u2019s worth considering this now while your weight is still under control. Losing it is much, much harder than simply keeping yourself from gaining it.",

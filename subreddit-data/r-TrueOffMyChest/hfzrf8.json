So here's the deal, yes I understand the textbook definition of the classes has a lot more than 3, there's actually 9 classes lower-lower, lower-middle, lower-upper, middle-lower and so on. I'm also fully aware I'm a long impossible way from middle-middle-class. That's not really my point. The point however is that the media only portrays us as having 3 classes and does everything it can to make it appear we \"the working class\" as many have called it, is anywhere remotely close to the upper 3 classes.\n\nFor those of you that think because I have a job I'm just as far from knowing what it's like to be poor as I am in knowing what it's like to be rich you know nothing. I've been on welfare, I've tasted the hell that is powered milk, I've been without a paycheck. I know what it's like to heat your house with your fucking electric stove because your gas got turned off because you couldn't afford to pay the bill. What I don't know is what it feels like to do whatever the heck I want whenever the heck I want without a care in the world, to order a meal without looking at the price on the menu, to sue somebody just for the thrill of it, to go to the hospital without worrying about how much it's going to cost me when the bill comes in.\n\nI agree what a few of you has said that we're basically the buffer between the classes, given enough to care about that we're willing to fight to keep it, even if it means having to defend the 0.1% from the poor.",

First off, Property taxes are one of 3 ways schools get funding.\n\nProperty taxes are usually not applied to a specific school. They are applied to a *school district*, which a lot of the time combines several different schools that are at different income levels. Obviously, this isn't a perfect system and varies state to state in the equity of it, but this helps correct for some of the income inequality.\n\nSecond, more than half of a schools funding comes from the state and federal level. This funding is mostly used to correct for inequality in the property tax funding.\n\nThis is a neat analysis showing how that works:\n\n [https://apps.urban.org/features/school-funding-do-poor-kids-get-fair-share/](https://apps.urban.org/features/school-funding-do-poor-kids-get-fair-share/) \n\nIt is also important to note that the family environment matters just as much as the funding. A better school doesn't just mean 'more money'; it means growing up in an environment that values education. The stereotypical bad school has children that don't respect their teachers and are disruptive - which leads to their teachers burning out, which means overall worse education, even if the funding was the same to start. It also means vandalism of property which means funds have to be appropriated toward repairs instead of toward new computers for the library for example.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe funding situation isn't perfect, but it is not the only, or even the most important issue, with the school system.",

Although each school district is funded partially by property taxes, a lot of money comes from the state as well. In fact, the crappy urban schools spend a decent amount more money per student than the other two cities. The rich city with good schools spends the least.\n\nIn general, America spends way more per student than the Eurozone countries, by as much as a factor of 2.\n\nBasically we would be so lucky if it was simply a money problem.",

Whether it be a product of the good school system making property values increased or a product of the higher taxes making the school good, I can tell you for a fact that the land alone in my area is close to a million dollars for what would be considered a standard size suburban plot. That\u2019s not even including the houses. The school systems fuck America up big time. It forces the poor to huddle together with shitty schooling. Just as the previous commenter stated my parents chose to live paycheck to paycheck for the chance at me getting better schooling and it\u2019s been tough.",

Yes they are funded by property tax, but the tax is payed into a pool and distributed on a per-pupil basis based on district.\n\nIn theory \"richer\" cities will have better schools and their property taxes are higher due to homes being more valuable. However, in a city like mine where you have a huge range of property values, it's more equitable since money is distributed from the tax pool. So money from taxes on a $2m house pays for the same schools and taxes from a $100k house.",

Until then, working class Americans were both aware and typically proud of being working class, and this term was in common use. Many old Life Magazine photos had captions like \"Working class families using the public bath at the steel mill\".\n\nBut with the rise of the Soviet Union, the US sought to erradicate any vestige of class consciousness in the country. After all, it's dangerous to exploit workers who can organize, fight and vote *as workers*, while thinking *as workers* and defending the interests of *workers*.\n\nThe US *could* have tried to achieve this by going back to brutally repressing workers, as it had done throughout the industrial era and until WWII (see Joe Hill, Sacco and Vanzetti, IWW, the Homestead Strike, Haymarket and many others). But the more workers were massacred and their leaders persecuted or murdered, the harder they fought.\n\nSo a different strategy was devised. \"Communist\" ideas like \"working class\" and \"class consciousness\" were made taboo (McCarthy and his ilk cemented this), and everyone became \"middle class\" -- steelworkers, managers, doctors and oligarchs alike.\n\nAnd boy did that work. So well that nowadays most American workers have been so deeply --and more importantly, *subtly*-- brainwashed that they are *anti-*union, and many regularly vote for politicians who openly and shamelessly work to further the interests of the upper classes, at the expense of workers.",

Executives getting drunk at lunch and heading to golf at 2pm most days. \n\nIn fact these management practices were one of the greatest drivers for modern private equity, because actually hard working elites saw these lazy bums as lovely snacks just sitting there to be take over from.\n\nIt killed an era, which was certainly a loss. It's weird that those lazy executives might have been better for the middle class than the workaholic Harvard MBAs that followed, creating 20x more value than the 3rd gen Yale men did, but also taking home 15x more money.\n\nIt's still a win for the company, but income inequality certainly blew up.",

In the US, two parents earning 65k each is an incredibly good income, it would put you in the top 20% of households in America. \n\nTwo parents both earning six figures would land you anywhere between the top 8% and top 1%. If *that* counts as middle class, then the vast majority of the country is lower class. \n\nDepending on where you live and how big your family is, you can have a stable job well above minimum wage and still be living paycheck-to-paycheck with insecure housing. *This* is my personal definition of the modern middle class. You\u2019re living fine, but you don\u2019t have financial security and your savings can be wiped out by a single medical bill. You probably have bad credit.\n\nLower-class is more common than you think. Your savings can\u2019t be wiped out by a bill because you don\u2019t have savings. Your sole priorities are food and rent, everything else is expendable. You don\u2019t have bad credit because you can\u2019t even use credit.\n\nThe pervasiveness of this lower-class means middle-class is what lower-class would be in most other first-world countries. \n\nUpper-middle class, for me, means you can go a couple days without looking at your bank account. You have baseline financial security, and you likely own property.",

US doctors limit the total number of residency slots to control the supply of doctors and inflate their earnings.  US doctors need incredibly high scores / grades to be selected for medical school so they really are the best brightest. But it is a cartel.

His financial advisor even worked with me to develop a reasonable and realistic life long plan that would leave me a millionaire in retirement. I know what to do, and how to do it, but my hands are tied. I would love to have a massive head start on my retirement by maxing our IRA contributions.\n\nMy mother and father got married out of high school and started together with NOTHING. Through the sweat of their brow and my dad\u2019s pure determination they pulled them selves up a \u201cclass\u201d. Both sets of my grandparents came from the poorest poor. My dad set out a life long financial plan and stuck to it. This is despite a total of 3 lay offs between my parents during the earliest years of my life. \n\nLong story short my parents DID IT, and I don\u2019t think we can.

Each job I've got after another I increased my pay 10%-15%. I'm making over 80k a year now. Never went to technical school.

Reason? No idea. Maybe I didn't qualify, maybe people didn't like me, maybe I asked for too much money. I just know that no one inside the companies ever got promoted either. Every single person was an outside new hire.\n\nIf you want a raise, you switch jobs.",

You should be able to work part time to make enough for rent during that time to only need to borrow for tuition.  A 4 year degree can be as low as 20k in most states.  That is not crippling debt.  Even making 40k a year, you can swing 3k per year for 10 years to get it paid off (250 a month for 10 years).\n\nFor undergrad I did 4 years at state school, lived at home (low rent), and worked 30 hours a week the whole time.  Ended up with about 20k in student loans, 15k of which was paid off by the end of my first year making about 40k. I lived in a crappy basement apt, but wanted out of debt fast.\n\nLong term, i went back to law school and took out 120k in student loans there.  It is taking me longer to pay back; but i am 5 (almost 6) years into paying them back on a 10 year note (i only make about 80k, so those payments are rough)",

The amount of people who i went to high-school with who opted to go into 100 - 150k in debt for their career that nets them 45k a year pre-tax is astounding (and of course they all demand their student loans be forgiven). Likewise, myself and some others went to community College or tech school, spent 3k a year, and came out immediately into high demand, high paying jobs. This idea that you HAVE to go to a university to get a good job is completely untrue, and is part of what is leading to the undervalue of college degrees (if everyone has one, why not require a basic office worker have one?). \n\nI was 100% on-board with Yang's ideas on education reform.

For upper middle class, they have actually less incentive to save than the poor. Poor people are more likely to work jobs where they can be fired at will, and are more likely to rent, and to have no health insurance or poor health insurance. That is to say, they have a high level of instability that incentivizes saving. Obviously their low income makes this very difficult. Upper middle class people tend to work as professionals. They tend to have steady work, are less likely to be fired, have paid leave, good insurance. This means that the likelihood that they will have an unforeseen expense that they have to cover out of pocket is unlikely. Once you have consistency, you have less incentive to save. The less likely a rainy day looks, the less you have reason to prepare. \n\nWhat such a metric would do is create groups mixing low income-unstable status with medium/high income- stable status. Certainly a valuable contribution, but I\u2019m unsure how useful it would be for a class discussion. Most upper class and upper middle class people with a low savings ratio would find little else in common with their poorer peers.",

In the US it could be as low as 42k a year and up to 120k a year. \n\nIn my area 2 parents with 2 kids could work full time at Walmart and just barely make about 42k. A teacher and a nurse could with no children and quite a bit of career experience could make 120k a year. They are both \"middle class\" for economic purposes but the difference is night and day. You would also have to look at your area median income. 42k would not be near enough to have a family in New York City but you might be ok in Kansas City. \n\nIt's really useful for measuring the overall health of the economy and the health and robustness of the middle percentiles of an economy, but it doesn't really say much about your situation at all. If you are one paycheck away from broke then you are most likely not middle class.",

You know how much harder it is pick yourself up from rock bottom, if they would have helped us out before we got to that point we could have put gas in that van and she could have drove to more job interviews, etc. But no, wait till you have no vehicle, no money, no nice clothes, no nothing, then you get tossed some scraps and told to pick yourself up you lazy drain on society.",

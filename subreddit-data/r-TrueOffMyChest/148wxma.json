    "postText": "I have a friend (G) that I made 2 years ago, but knew him for about 4. My other friend (P) that I made around the same time got us all to hang out and we all hit it off from there. Fast forward to now, I\u2019ve begun to feel as though our friendship is waning. I\u2019ve asked G a few times if he wanted hang out with me or do something, but he only wants to do stuff if P is involved. If P isn\u2019t going to make it, then we don\u2019t do anything. I\u2019ve hung out with P a few times just me and him, and a few times with G, but it feels like G isn\u2019t wanting to hangout. \n\nG has other friends he plays games with and chats with online, and I\u2019ve notice he acts different around them than with me or the group. It\u2019s just starting to culminate into me feeling like he doesn\u2019t want to hangout as much. I\u2019ve talked to him about feeling like I don\u2019t do anything when I\u2019m off, and he just suggests finding new friends to hang out with. I\u2019m just tired of feeling like I\u2019m sidelined. \n\nI want to be a closer friend but it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019ll be possible. It feels like I\u2019m wasting my time on someone who won\u2019t put that same effort. I feel like I\u2019m categorized as the friend to hang out and drink with and nothing else. I feel like I\u2019m wrong for wanting something, and feel like I\u2019m expecting something out of nothing.",

Maybe there\u2019s a way you can convey your feelings without making things worse? Because it seems the way things are right now are far from optimal.",

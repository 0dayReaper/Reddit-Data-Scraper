    "postText": "I was trying to find a second job this summer due to my current job only giving me like 10-15 hours a week but the pay is pretty good I get 12 an hour but it\u2019s not enough and when my friends are at work I have literally nothing to do. \n\nI rear ended somebody and totaled my car now I am basically stuck at home and when I do work I have to find a way to get to and from work. I got in trouble a while ago because my mom made my curfew 12:00 AM for the first time ever but I got home around 12:10 due to having to drop my friend off before coming home and she made my curfew 9:30 PM. I signed up for some classes and I found out I don\u2019t even qualify for the classes because my grades weren\u2019t good enough.\n\nI\u2019m just so stressed I work tomorrow at 12 in the morning and I truly have no idea how I am getting two and from work if we are being honest. I feel so stupid for totaling my car and my stepdad won\u2019t even talk to me for some reason now like even if I do Like a simple greeting to him he\u2019ll just ignore it or start talking to the dog.\n\nIt just keeps getting worse and worse. Some good things that have happened I went to go visit my first college and I think I might actually wanna go there when I graduate. I also got accepted to connections academy so now I might be able to get my diploma early.\n\nI\u2019m so worried though because lately it seems like everything academically related is just not going well. Like I have no idea what I\u2019m gonna do if I don\u2019t get accepted into college.",

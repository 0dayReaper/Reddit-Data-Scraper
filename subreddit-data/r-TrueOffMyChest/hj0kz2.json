    "postText": "I understand your empathy about others and those who are underprivileged but god damn you people make it seem like I have to walk into a damn pity party every day. I get up, work, eat, sleep, and shit just like you. I can\u2019t fathom this idea that many non black people have it in their heads that they should feel sorry for us all the time. Like it feels like whatever accomplishment I make you have to make it seem as if I need some extra attention, like I\u2019m the kid at show and tell who needs a forced hand clap. I don\u2019t want to be seen as underprivileged but I want to be seen as your equal. When I see all these white celebs give up their jobs because they feel sorry it just makes me angry. No, you earned your job just like I will earn mine. It\u2019s virtual signaling at this and tbh it\u2019s infuriating.\n\nEdit: didn\u2019t know this was going to blow up! \n\nLet\u2019s clarify that I\u2019m talking about white and non black people who go on pity parties for black people with out warrant, i.e going out of their way to signal that blacks are underprivileged and will never be looked at by them as their equal. There\u2019s a difference from being upset about issues and trying to virtue signal that you\u2019re a good white person. Black people don\u2019t want be seen like we can\u2019t do fo ourselves... I should say most of us because there are some who still have a mentality they can\u2019t do anything.",

Racism is a spectrum and it doesn\u2019t end with nut jobs pulling guns on people in a park. It can be a subtle thing like thinking of someone as less intelligent or less capable or needing your approval for their life decisions. These are kind of people who see a white family adopt a black child and think there\u2019s somehow Saints for doing it as if they didn\u2019t want a child and that child is somehow less deserving of a loving family. Somehow they\u2019re special because they chose a black child instead of a white child because it somehow makes a difference.\n\nI am a white woman married to a black man. When we first started dating we were both considerably overweight, but I had bariatric surgery a couple of years ago and I lost all the weight. I am now yes quite small and basically conventionally attractive. I\u2019ve actually had people ask me if I was going to keep dating my husband, then boyfriend, now that I lost weight. They Literally relieved that I was with him at least partly because I was a fat white woman and could only get a bigger  black man to love me. I got so angry when I heard that. My husband, then boyfriend, has stuck with me and help me through the surgery, so the depression that followed, through every trial and tribulation I\u2019ve gone through, and all the time has shown me over and over how amazing he is. I married him last weekend after our first wedding was canceled by Covid, and I know for a fact it was the best decision I\u2019ve made in my entire life. I don\u2019t care if he never lose a pound and I stay skinny and fit for the rest of my life, because no one will ever love me or have my back like he does, and I love him more than I knew I could love anyone. He\u2019s truly my first love. I never felt the way I do about him about anyone before, and we both make an active effort to be good partners to each other and improve our relationship all the time. I literally couldn\u2019t be luckier, and for someone to suggest that I could somehow do better because I was skinny now made me want to punch them in the face. It was a coworker and I\u2019m a teacher so I didn\u2019t. Instead I play dumb and ask them what they meant until they had no choice but either say exactly what I knew they were implying, or give up and leave. They walked away pretty quick, and I lost all respect for them forever.\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be more of them in the future that I have to deal with when I take my little mixed race children out with me and people assume they can\u2019t be mine because I\u2019m so white and they most likely won\u2019t be, and I\u2019m still figuring out how I\u2019m going to react, because I want to make sure that I teach my children the right things, and hitting people in public is not the right thing. At that point, I might straight up called him out on what they were implying, and make them say it until they realize how fucked up it is\ufffc",

Someone commenting that something is racist probably doesn't care about getting you canceled, instead they just want to express their opinion to you.  The problem is that it gains momentum and then cancel culture gets involved.\n\nWe need to not spread this divisiveness by attacking people.  We need to actually have a conversation. I believe that sunlight is the best disinfectant for bad ideas so they should be expressed and discussed but not validate d.  It's how people learn.  Only using the stick and never the carrot is called abuse and it's basically the reason we are where we are today no matter which side of the argument you are on",

Talking about how he was so great because he bought them a meal at burger king.  It really is pathetic how some people can't just grasp the idea of treating someone like a person, no more no less.  I can't stand when someone wants to give someone special treatment because of their ethnicity.  It's almost as stupid as treating someone less than because of their skin color.",

Lady, we know. He's a nice guy, his kids are well behaved, and he fits in with the family. Why not focus on that instead?\n\nThe best part is when my sister started getting serious with a Filipino dude and that same aunt asked her if that was a good idea. Apparently she kept banging out the stuff about her black son-in-law because she was trying to convince herself it was great, not the rest of us. Like most virtue signallers, she thought the rest of us suffer with racist thoughts just like she does.",

It's hard to know where to stand, because acting \"white\" makes you a bootlicker and a privileged suburban hoe rat, acting normal makes you apathetic and potentially racist, and acting more sympathetic makes you an apologetic creepo who is trying to repent for all your ancestors sins. Or alternatively a someone trying to \"privilege speak\" on issues who should remain silent and apathetic. I don't even know how to act anymore. So I think that is what drives people to be the more extreme versions of all of that, because they would rather die on their hill than try and be a little different for everyone, (aka tactful and cautious).",

Their oversight was supposed to be juries and the justice system, but qualified immunity made them partly beyond reproach.  Their power must be reigned in by the people, not bureaucrats.  Sheriffs need to be elected, not appointed.  Police departments should not be revenue generators for the state.  That\u2019s how we got to this point in the first place.  And don\u2019t buy into or treat police like they\u2019re better or somehow not the same as their fellow civilians.  Our taxes pay for them and we allow them to exist.

I think this is what Kanye West was trying to get at when he said slavery was a choice.\n\nEveryone freaked out at him, but I think he was actually trying to give it an empowering spin. He was trying to say that if black people really wanted to, they could have freed themselves or avoided slavery altogether.  Whether that was true or not doesn't matter, he was trying to say take responsibility for what happened. Like literally instead of pretending like it was just inevitable and unavoidable that white people would dominate black people or something, face up to the fact that it happened the way it did. \n\nLike ya, whoever had anything to do with slavery were horrible people (on the white and black side of things), but black people still made choices that led to it happening. If they had made different choices maybe they could have either fought back against the nations that enslaved them. \n\nBut that can be applied to the now too.  Look at other groups who have gone through tragedy. Japan was nuked fucking twice. Asians were forced to work on the railroads. The Jews experienced a genocide.\n\nDid those groups beg their oppressors to say sorry and make reparations? Or did they take the reins of their own destiny and make shit happen for their people??? Did they complain about how hard it was and how disadvantaged things were for them and say fuck we can't go on until our former oppressors continue to take care of us for eternity?  No, eventually they all moved on.\n\nSo this shit is actually demeaning to black people too. It is over, it is the past, allow modern day whites and blacks to be friends without this feeling like modern day whites had any fucking thing to do with the past. Because we don't. \n\nAnd I'm not apologizing for something I didn't do. And black people should not expect people who look like people who enslaved them years ago to help them become better. They need to fucking make it happen. That, they have control over.  Otherwise they just take however much welfare is given and who the fuck wants to do that forever?\n\nI am white and have been on welfare for 5 years. It is a fucking trap I should have never applied. It is disability because I am mentally ill. But I get at most $900 a month. \n\nJust hoping someday they will expand it, give me more money.\n\nFuck man, no. There are things I can do. I can return to the university I dropped out of, I can go to therapy twice a week, go to rehab. And I have started doing those things. I am a little over a year sober off meth now. \n\nBut holy shit dude before? I was blaming the healthcare system, my parents for raising me poorly, the kids at school for bullying me. Was any of that empowering? Fuck no! It is a certain comfort to feel like a victim, but it is so much better once you realize you can see reality for exactly what it is and read the situation, the people who have oppressed you, and instead of ruminating in that you can actually from this moment on make the best of it. \n\nAnyway no idea if this makes sense my mind is meth addled after all. I am missing several million neurons I'm sure. But I am trying to wrap my own idea of things around this concept. Because I am myself just trying to learn how to stop blaming others for the way my life turned out.",

Ive heard that some people with disabilities prefer it, but I\u2019m sure there are others who hate it (and a whole bunch who don\u2019t care either way). I think the original point of the term was to get away from the notion that people with physical disabilities are \u201cbroken\u201d or fragile or whatever. Eg, afaik there\u2018s a non-insignificant number of people in the deaf community who dislike cochlear implants, and who see deafness as part of their identity. I feel like those folks would probably feel pretty put-off by the notion that they\u2018re \u201cdisabled\u201d.\n\nI will almost certainly screw things up as I go along in life, but as imperfect people in a constantly changing social/political landscape, I think generally adopting a \u201cdon\u2019t be dicks to each other\u201d approach and being receptive to feedback is the best we can realistically hope for. Anyone striving for perfection in this regard is probably going to find themselves having a hard time because there will always be disagreement (and evolution) regarding what is \u201cright\u201d.",

No one can ever fully understand another's life, but why the fuck should you be expected to do so just to help another person carry their burden? You don't need to suffer what another person suffers to empathize with them. \n\nNo, you don't *fully* understand, but there's nothing embarrassing about that. In fact, I'm happy you don't have to feel that. I wouldn't wish the entire weight of it upon you. But if you've ever felt discriminated against over something you can't control, then there's enough common ground for you to at least partially understand and express your feelings towards it, especially if they're feelings of support more than feelings of comparison. \n\nShame just widens the rifts between social groups, and makes you see the marginalized as \"others\" to be pitied and coddled. That shame makes them seem as inferiors in need of protection, instead of peers in need of empowerment. \n\nI guess what I would say is, just avoid saying \"I understand\" and compare each other's suffering.  Instead, look to the future you both would prefer: \"I wish _______ was different\"",

But suddenly Justin from my 11th grade English class feels the need to repeatedly demonstrate to his audience of mostly white friends that he\u2019s not \u201cone of them.\u201d  It serves almost no purpose other than to propagate the idea that \u201cwe\u201d (whites) should all feel guilty, while exonerating himself of the guilt.\n\nThe whole concept of \u201cwhite\u201d is a construction anyway.  My grandparents were from Greece and southern Italy and when they were young they weren\u2019t even considered \u201cwhite people\u201d.  But now I\u2019m supposed to feel guilty for \u201cour\u201d past?  \n\n\nWhen I was in college, rap music was heavily marketed to suburban white kids as \u201ccool.\u201d  A lot of kids, myself included, idolized artists like 2pac and Biggie and Jay-Z.  But now if someone would uncover a 2002 video of a non-black rapping along to the actual lyrics of these tracks, we\u2019re canceled.  Lumped in with Hitler, the KKK, fascists, etc?

Blacks get judged, yes true, but so do whites when around other races (blacks, Hispanics, Asians, etc). No one should feel guilty for anything from the past, if we want change to anything, we have to start with ourselves. And by the way our current president was trying to abolish 2 whole races from entering our country as a whole yet blacks are the only lives that deserve attention. Let\u2019s see this movement for what it is, a divide that will only grow wider by making blacks alone think they have been less and will never achieve anything unless everything changes for them. As Morgan Freeman said the way to stop racism is to stop talking about it. Anyone and everyone can achieve anything if they work hard enough for it no matter your race, ethnicity, religion, sex, or sexuality, THIS IS AMERICA!",

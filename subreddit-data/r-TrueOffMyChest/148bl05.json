    "postText": "hi reddit, super long post coming. so, i (18F) found out yesterday that my now ex bf (18M) cheated on me. we were together for over a year and did just about everything you could imagine together. i mean, shit, we even had our entire future planned out, we were that serious. it\u2019s june 13th now, and around may 29th he was starting to act a little odd but i didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\na couple weeks go by and all is well. i did notice a change in his behavior, like how he was beginning to \u201csleep\u201d super late, sometimes until 5-6pm, or he would take extremely long naps, im talking 10+ hour naps in the middle of the day but for some reason i never suspected he was doing anything but sleeping bc i trusted him so much, and this happened a couple times a week for like 2 weeks. starting on wednesday, he seemed really distant. he was becoming more dry with me, taking longer to answer, and he was getting mad at me for what seemed like everything. i knew that he was going through a hard time tho, so i just let it slide off.\n\nthis distant behavior carried on into sunday which is the day i found out. everything was the same until around 9 when i got a text from his best friends ex saying that she had something to tell me about my boyfriend. i said okay and i called her, and well, it was exactly what i feared. he cheated on me. from june 1st-june 11th, he cheated on me with multiple women. i didn\u2019t want to believe any of it, but all of the voices, pictures, and texts were right there.\ni never in a million years thought this would happen, since he told me our whole relationship that he only wanted me and that he would never put himself in a position to lose me, yet he did. with two women.\n\nthe first woman was his \u201cdealer\u201d. he biked up to her house to go see her multiple days in a row for two weeks. i saw photo evidence of them together with his shirt off all up on each other. when asked if they had sex, his response was \u201cdon\u2019t worry about it\u201d in a time that was almost joke-like and it made me feel so sick. the problem with this is that he started to make every excuse under the sun not to see me. for example, he\u2019d say \u201ci don\u2019t have a ride\u201d or \u201ci have to stay home with my siblings\u201d or \u201ci have to go to my dads\u201d. it hurt sm every time he said he couldn\u2019t see me, but i just put up with it.\n\nthe second girl (his best friend ex gf) reached out to him on wednesday and was flirting with him, and he reciprocated back even tho that\u2019s his best friends ex and i used to be good friends with her, so it\u2019s obvious that i would find out at some point. and, he didn\u2019t just flirt, he sent her explicit pictures which he hasn\u2019t done for me in weeks because he told me his sex drive was low due to him being depressed, he told her he was in love with her, that she was better than me, told her amazing things about her body which he hadn\u2019t done for me in months (i mean, i had to basically force him to compliment me), talked about fucking her, and he even asked her to be his and spoke of marriage and children with her. apparently he had feelings for her our whole relationship and was just waiting for her to reach out to him again.\n\neven tho this only went on for a few days, he still did it and he begged her to keep talking to him. he betrayed me and did the one thing he swore he would never do. he would not admit to cheating until he realized i had proof, and even after that all he could say was \u201cyeah\u201d and nod his head. i asked him why he did it, and he said it\u2019s because he was unhappy with his life and he was depressed because his mom is dying, and because he didn\u2019t know how to communicate with me. he then proceeded to blame me for his communication issues, and basically said that i drove him to do it. apparently he was going to tell me, but you know, that\u2019s what cheaters always say. even tho it\u2019s only been a couple days, it hasn\u2019t even hit me yet, like, i haven\u2019t cried much, and i think it\u2019s because it\u2019s so unreal that i don\u2019t even believe it even though the warning signs were there early on in our relationship. i have no idea what to do, how to move on, or what steps to take.\n\ni already broke up with him and blocked him on everything but i don\u2019t know how to forgive him, and i don\u2019t know if i will. i feel so lost, helpless, ugly, unlovable, and confused. i loved him so much. he was the first man i ever fell in love with, and i\u2019m not sure how to move on from this at all. he told me i was his first love too and that he was in love with me. he told me that he\u2019s never loved anyone as much as he loves me, yet he still did this and according to him on the first girl he\u2019s ever cheated on which i don\u2019t believe. but, if it\u2019s true, why me? i did literally everything for him. i mothered him, provided for him, and isolated myself from everyone in my life, because he convinced me that anyone who wasn\u2019t him was bad for me. i gave him unlimited chances and i forgave him over and over again but that\u2019s on me and i know it, yet here i am wondering how i could\u2019ve stopped him from cheating and what i could\u2019ve done differently. i hate how much i gave to him. i gave up my whole life for him, and now i\u2019m left with nothing and no one. he\u2019s ruined me and i hate him so much, yet i am still so in love with him and i miss him so much.\n\nTLDR: my boyfriend of over a year cheated on me with multiple women and i don\u2019t know how to move on or process any of it. i keep blaming myself.",

            "comment": "So long, good riddance. My biggest concern is you seeking the therapy you need after this. This wasn\u2019t your fault and there is nothing that causes this nor anyway to prevent it. As women get older, they learn to get smarter to watch for the \u2018red flags\u2019, and begin to recognise the type of guys who do these things vs the kind that don\u2019t. Even then sometimes we still get fooled.\n\nYou will grow, get stronger and find more suitable men over time.\n\nWhereas this guy looks like he\u2019s going to continue doing this to girls because he lacks maturity/respect of the responsibilities that come with being in a relationship. Using girls to feel better about himself whenever he\u2019s down, is not the type of guy you want to be with. \n\nIt happens. My ex told me all of those things too, and i spent 5 years with him. I fixed his life. Brought him out of debt and put a roof over his head. Spent years travelling with him and having fun\u2026 but he still cheated on me and tried to make it out that he couldn\u2019t communicate with me either about his issues (had no problem complaining about any other issue though..). These guys are better off as friends, and you\u2019re too good for them.",

Just take some time for yourself, it'll take time but learn to forgive and move on. I was cheated on 3 times around your age and I forgave them for being young and dumb and moved on with my life. Dating at your age sucks ass, especially now. I started around then and didn't find my wife until I was 25. It takes time to find the right one and to learn. Don't blame yourself or try to look into it too much. It's not like you guys had established a life together and were together 5 years.",

    "postText": "Get ready for all the frustration I'm going to rant about right now, it's going to be a long one.\r  \n\r  \nContext for people who don't know, \u201cBookTok\u201d is a community within the TikTok platform where writers and readers mostly recommend romance books, talk about tropes (a particular theme within the book, example: enemies to lovers, friends to lovers, arranged marriages, etc.) that each book contains or create videos about a specific couple/saga/book that is your favorite, so far so good.\r  \n\r  \nThe truth is that I'm fed up with it and I hate it, I need to get it off my chest even though many people will get mad at me, I don't care anymore. Really, it's not possible that at some point the entire reading community has accepted \u201ca standard\u201d within books, the only thing I find when I want to read something new is a FMC (Female Main Character) that doesn't know how to defend herself, nor give her place as a person, or she does not have self-love/respect, she always lets the MMC (Male Main Character) do whatever he wants to her, it seems that if she is not humiliated, controlled, mistreated, is abused somehow, and disrespected, then it can't be a romance book.\r  \n\r  \nThe guy isn't even a \u201cBad Boy\u201d, he's just a bad person who just because he has some sort of trauma gets a free pass to mistreat everyone, and they have to accept it and that's it, even when the others also may have some kind of problems or traumas too, and still don't treat others like poop. Apparently if you're a billionaire, mobster / mafia boss, a six-pack and have a 8 inch pack, anything can be forgiven and everyone loves you because you'd do anything for the FMC except treat her like a decent human being.\r  \n\r  \nWhich brings me to my other point, apparently FMCs can't have self-respect because since the guy is apparently an intimacy god, she can't think when he approaches her (???), is he supposed to tell me what I can and can't do while my opinion is completely ignored and, at the same time, he's going to do what he wants just because he's the man, and I'm going to find it attractive because he is \u201chot\u201d? (???), which happens a lot everywhere apparently, especially in \u201cDark Romance\u201d, where the phrase \u201cIt's just fiction\u201d is justification enough for the MMC to treat the FMC like poop, and she has to accept it, because apparently women always forgive men just because, when they would make your life hell if you did a fraction of what they did to you (which happens in countless books).\r  \n\r  \nIt doesn't matter if they cheated on you, it doesn't matter if they even SA you (Because yes, in a video I read a comment where a person mentioned that the MMC SA the FMC several times and the author defended herself by saying that it wasn't all the time, and she sometimes enjoyed it (?????), like another author who justified that in a marriage of convenience the woman wanted to divorce, but the man was not letting her and threatened to hurt her, her family, leave her without money among many other things, because, according to the author, he would do everything for her because he loves her, but he couldn't accept it, he hardly allowed her to leave the house while he was with other women), it doesn't matter if they take away what you want, or they force you to fold your hands to do what they want, it doesn't matter if they blame you for their actions (sudden attacks of violence, they do it because they love you too much and don't know how to show it), you will end up forgiving them, I guess It is the nature of women, otherwise it is not possible, the only type of drama a book can have is if the man drags the woman across the floor, they always love him deeply and give them more opportunities.\r  \n\r  \nIt is always the same story of saying that it is fiction and that it is not for everyone, but holly cow, it is necessary to write a romance / Dark Romance book where the guy is a worthless and the girl has no self-esteem, so he breaks her as a human being and in the end he has to grovel to amend his mistakes?\r  \n\r  \nDo they always have to screw up? Do they always have to treat her badly? Is that the new romance? They always have to be a Mafia boss? Also, boss of what? Everything that is illegal ends directly or indirectly with human trafficking or prostitution, I don't know about you, but I would not feel very comfortable if my \u201chusband\u201d participated in human trafficking, I have given some books the benefit of the doubt in this, because they are in the mafia, but it is not said of what, they just are.\r  \n\r  \nThey tell you to read the trigger warnings because they are books with sensitive topics (all the ones I already mentioned), but everyone romanticizes them, it's their new standard of man, it's the least they have to do, and I should read it because it's very good and very popular, they sell you the nice side, and it turns out that I already spent my time and my money on something that was false.\r  \n\r  \nNot to mention that now the communities of fans of certain books are SUPER TOXIC, you have to have the same opinion, otherwise, they will rain insults until you die, they justify everything and romanticize everything and hope that everyone is fine and accepts it. Believe me that, when I tell you that I am not going to read them because they are not my thing, I am not going to, so you can leave your intensity at home, thank you very much.\r  \n\r  \nEven when you are giving your opinion about it, and they tell you \u201cwell, don't read them anymore\u201d, sometimes it\u2019s a little too late to know, but thanks for your tremendous advice.\r  \n\r  \nI know that it seems that I am exaggerating or overreacting, but it is not like that, anyone who has been reading for years can name numerous books that are like this, and I am exhausted, the female protagonists in the books always have to go around caring, forgiving and educating the guys, as if they don't know how to function, they are perfectly capable of putting everyone before her, but they demand to be their priority, the girl never defends herself and always has to fall for the non-existent charms of the guy, wanting to force all their actions as sweet and cute when they are not, and don't you even dare ask them to know how to communicate, apparently it's impossible for them as adults.\r  \n\r  \nThere are really countless examples that I can put here but just remembering them makes me angry, there is not a single recommendation that I have found in which something similar does not happen, and before someone comes to shade me, no, I am not going to force anyone to write or stop writing something just because I don't like it, nor to read or stop reading something just because I like it, or I don't like it, but you have to be very aware of reality of this community right now, it saddens me a lot that I can't do what I love because I don't find anything that halfway through the reading doesn't come up with something like what I already mentioned.\r  \n\r  \nNo romance is perfect, and I understand that there have to be problems or the authors want to create drama to do something interesting, and that's fine, but we are already in 2023, I don't need fragile masculinity, or abusive men, or sexism, or misogyny in my hobby, I already have enough in real life for something as nice as reading to also present it to me. The way they represent women, is not it. \r  \n\r  \nReading is very important to me, it's something that makes me happy, it's the way I can have fun, get out of my reality and live a thousand lives and stories without leaving my house, and it makes me sad that I can't continue enjoying it. I feel like I'm being forced to take a break.\r  \n\r  \nIf you've already read up to this point, thank you, tremendous patience you have, I just needed to get it out of my head, so I could feel at peace, have a good day today.\r  \n\r  \n(And if you have any recommendations for me, I would really appreciate it, please and thank you) :)",

Most of the time communities somehow ruin just about anything.\n\nOther than that, reading is a pretty fun thing to do if you just wanna chill or sit around. \n\nSome books that I would recommend would definitely be Ashes in the Snow (about a girl in what I believe is ww2 I think?) The Thief Lord (brothers who run away to Venice and find a group of other orphan or homeless kids and live in an abandoned movie theater) or anything by Alan Gratz. His stories are usually about real historic events.\n\n\nSorry if this sounds kinda confusing lol I don't really comment stuff like this often and don't know how to transition from one thing to another",

            "comment": "I watch a lot of booktok videos and while I know what kind of videos/accounts you\u2019re talking about the vast majority of booktok is not like this\n\nFirst, I hardly ever get romance recs on booktok, stop interacting with those and search for other tags if they annoy you so much. You clearly have an issue with the current trend of dark/morally gray MMC in mainstream romance so I\u2019d recommend you try historical romance. Or, fade to black romances if you don\u2019t care about the spice. Those normally don\u2019t have such intense MMC\u2019s. \n\nOverall, you\u2019re clearly reading books and watching booktok videos that aren\u2019t meant for you. Not everyone is going to like every book, but clearly loads of people do like the kind of books you\u2019re being so negative about. No one is forcing you to read those books, and it\u2019s not a choice of \u2018read dark romances or don\u2019t read at all\u2019. Find another genre or sub genre that you like and stop torturing yourself with shit you already know you don\u2019t like. \n\nYou\u2019re not better than anyone else just because you don\u2019t like to read dark romance and your post reeks of superiority. Reading is for fun so if you\u2019re not enjoying those books don\u2019t bash on them, just try different genres.\n\nSaying that booktok has ruined reading for you is so dramatic. How does other people reading and enjoying books have any bearing on you? Just because people recommend a book on booktok doesn\u2019t mean you have to read it. You clearly know what you like and what you don\u2019t, so stop reading books you know you won\u2019t like.",

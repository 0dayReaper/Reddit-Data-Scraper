    "postText": "I've got a group of friends, and we wanted to plan a trip over the summer, one of the only times all of us could get together. This group of friends contains my ex (he broke up with me, we dated for around 3 years. I was friends with the group before I met him, they introduced me to him) but we have not been in contact with each other for months. When I was planning this trip I extended the invite to my ex, to which he rejected it. I didn't really want him there, but I thought for the sake of the group it would make things easier had he been invited at least. The trip ended up being \"dropped\" since scheduling issues, or at least so I thought. My best friend texted me and told me that the trip was not canceled, I just wasn't invited anymore because my ex would not allow me to come even though I willingly invited him. They took everything I planned and went ahead with it, and I get nothing. No extra trip with me, no alternate solution, simply just the boot. The only \"apology\" I ever got was that \"someone has to get the short end of the stick, and unfortunetly it is you\". The trip is next week, and I just feel kinda shitty.",

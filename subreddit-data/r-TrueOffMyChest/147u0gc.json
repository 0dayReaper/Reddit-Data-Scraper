    "postText": "So let me start off by saying individuals and/or any names listed in this story are changed for obvious reasons, but the majority of the story remains the same. I (F28) was in a wedding a little over three years back, and I always had this thought in the back of my mind but I didn\u2019t exactly know who to discuss it with and/or honestly who to trust besides my husband (M28), Matt. To start off, Matt and I have been together since high school for a total of 11 years - married for 2 years currently. I really only met his older sister, Angie, after 3-4 years of dating after she completed college. I always reckoned that it was simply because some nuclear family structures are different than others (I have always been close to my older siblings, so to try and understand my husband\u2019s familial relationships always threw me off). She did take on a \u201cmotherly role\u201d when they were both still in high school, as both their mother and father were largely absent (for reasons that I can\u2019t fully divulge) - there will be more to this \u201cmotherly role\u201d later in the story as well. So, the wedding that I took part in was Angie\u2019s, and I was absolutely ecstatic to be part of her and her fianc\u00e9\u2019s big day. However, Matt was not going to be part of that wedding - not even as a groomsman or as an usher (which I thought was absolutely wild) - even though Angie has kind of had that \u201cmotherly role\u201d to him since high school, has always bragged about how close she is to him, and also likes to discuss what, when, where, how, etc. Matt is doing at all\n times and in all places. I should clarify that when she discussed these topics about Matt, it\u2019s as if it is in a tone of voice/attitude as if I didn\u2019t know this about him, what he is doing, etc., so it rubs me the wrong way from time to time (almost as if it\u2019s snobbish?). This has only gotten worse over the years that I\u2019ve known her. Despite this, I\u2019ve come to know her as a really great person and driven individual in the career field that she is pursuing, despite her and my husband\u2019s disadvantaged childhood. So this is where my weird question/thought in the back of my mind comes into play with her wedding - after almost 8 years of dating Matt (boyfriend at the time and we were engaged two-ish months later after the wedding) and even myself being included in the wedding party, I was not asked to partake in any family photos at all. I don\u2019t know whether or not this should strike me as odd, considering how I\u2019ve gotten to know her over the years and at one point she did consider me to be her maid of honor (heard it from another bridesmaid) just months before getting engaged. It\u2019s not also as if Matt and I\u2019s relationship was \u201con the rocks\u201d at that point in time either, as we openly discussed getting married with his family and mine in the near future after Angie\u2019s wedding. On a side note, her and her husband were both included in our wedding photos, but even if we got married before them, I still would\u2019ve considered including her husband in some of the photos regardless. Should I feel left out of sorts? Or should I just take it as  it is?",

Odd that you were not included in any pics",

By now I'm used to be comfortably single and I've tried to meet new people online (I live on the country, not many new faces come by) a few times, but I feel nothing beyond friendship, no matter how much I try.\nMaybe my personality and tastes have something to do (think of Dr. Brennan from Bones and you'll get the idea), or a few bad experiences I had. I think I'm broken and I don't know if I can fix it.",

Society makes romantic relationships seem like the ultimate form of happiness in life but that\u2019s simply not true. So don\u2019t beat yourself up about it:) Do the things that make you happy and focus on your friendships. If later on you feel like dating, go for it, but do it because you want to and not because you feel like you\u2019re supposed to.",

Be grateful you didn\u2019t force yourself to be in a relationship just to feel companionship! It seems like you\u2019re comfortable with yourself which will only allow you to make more meaningful connections when the time comes. It may be slow at first, but trust the process and don\u2019t give up! \n\nEveryone can agree when I say it\u2019s normal to not be into the 1st, 5th, or even 20th person you meet past the friendship stage. It means you know what you want, just that it\u2019s a matter of when you\u2019ll know.",

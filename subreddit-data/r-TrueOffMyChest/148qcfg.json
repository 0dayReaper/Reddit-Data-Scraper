    "postText": "My parents, like many parents, were raised in broken homes with broken lives.  I'm proud of them for how far they came. And I'm grateful that I had privileges many others don't because of their hard work.  But...  After being diagnosed with C-PTSD as a result of a multitude of sustained traumatic periods, the memory of those few happy times with my parents have become quickly overshadowed by the pain, confusion, and distain I've been living with as the repressed memories resurface.\n\nMy parents, who I still visit and see, smile as though nothing happened.  They didn't do those awful things to me as a kid.  Like nothing ever happened. And when I try to come close to the truth, they double down and refuse to take responsibility, singing the narcissist prayer (metaphorically of course).\n\nI still love them.  And I cling to those good times with them.  But I feel the darkness of the bad times are tainting them.  And, through self reflection, I feel those precious memories I cling to so rigidly symbolize the last pieces of hope that maybe I too had a normal life with a good mom and dad.  But I know it's a lie.  Its all a lie.\n\nI still talk to them.  Why?  Because there's little ones in my extended family.  Ones who I fear, if I leave my parents, will have no support.  And I don't feel going no contact is necessary, as the abuse has stopped after I moved out of their home.  But I won't lie, going to dinner and watching them laugh and be merry, all while coming to grips with my abuse, it feels like watching a corpse reanimated.\n\nIt just hurts.",

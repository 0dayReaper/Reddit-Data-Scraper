    "postText": "I (18M) would give anything to be with my family (including cousins). My cousins are like siblings to me. I love them a lot (not romantically of course lol). My parents call their siblings and my cousins regularly.\n\nNow, every single time they call my uncle/aunt, I want to talk to them. I have a really strong urge to do so. But i am so shy. I am scared that I won\u2019t know what to talk about. My biggest fear is that I talk about something that I think is interesting but they\u2019ll look really disinterested. Most of the times, I\u2019ll ask them about their day, weather, time and that\u2019s pretty much it. I feel like they think I don\u2019t want to talk to them. \n\nWhen they call my cousins, I get so anxious. I almost never even want to come on the screen if it\u2019s a video call or make any noise. I don\u2019t think they want to talk about the weather or anything. I basically dream about being with them without feeling like they are only doing something with me just because I am younger than them. I don\u2019t want them to think like it\u2019s like their job to take care of me etc. and that\u2019s why they do so. \n\nOne thing that I love is when they ask about me and want to talk to me. I feel sort of redeemed (I can\u2019t find the right word for it). \n\nBut, I have no problems talking to anyone outside my family. It\u2019s because most of them won\u2019t be in my life throughout. Maybe, idk.",

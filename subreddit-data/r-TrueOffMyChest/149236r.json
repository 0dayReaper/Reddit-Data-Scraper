    "postText": "As the title states, I think I've fallen out of love with my husband because of some recent hardships in our relationship that have pushed me to my breaking point and maybe beyond.\n\nMy husband and I have only been married for about a year and a half but have been together for about four and half years total. From day one, he made me smile and made me feel like my world wasn't falling apart anymore, he was my knight in shining armor. I know that's probably pretty cliche but he really did save me from my own mental health and even on the worst of days, never gave up on me.\n\nLast year, we found out I was pregnant and we couldn't have been happier. We did everything we could to make sure our baby would be as happy and healthy as possible, followed every suggestion my ob/gyn gave, and began preparing much as possible. We even got married about halfway through the pregnancy so the baby and I would get my husband's military benefits.\n\nUnfortunately, before we even got married, shit hit the fan. Not long into the pregnancy, my husband left the house to, as he told me, go take a drug test for the military that they didn't tell him about until 'just now'. Of course, I believed him. I even offered to go with him to keep him company but he insisted I stay home because I'd just be bored waiting for him even though I'd tagged along to things like this before and happily waited in the car for him because I enjoyed going anywhere with him, regardless of the destination, I just liked spending time with him.\n\nLater, I found out why he didn't want me to come along and things haven't been the same since. He wasn't going to take a drug test, he wasn't even going to the base. He was going to meet up with someone else. I didn't mind that he wanted to meet someone else, we had previously talked about the idea and neither of us cared if we hooked up with someone else as long as we told the other about it. We were happy with each other though, so we never did, at least until then. The only reason I found out was he didn't come home for several weeks and I had to call the base I thought he was at to find him. It took my all dayy the next day to find him, only to find out he had gotten himself into some legal trouble and was arrested. I won't get into the details of the case because it's still on going but apparently, the girl he was supposed to meet up with was an undercover cop.\n\nAs soon as he came home, we had an emotional conversation about everything. He told me it was a mistake and he never should've left the house that day and he still wanted to be with me if I still loved him. Even though I didn't know what to think, I believed him and stayed. More recently, I got the chance to see some of the things he said in his messages with this girl, the things he wanted to do with her when they met up. On their own, none of the things were bad but they were the kinds of things he used to say to me when he started dating. It also talked about what he described his 'type' to be, which wasn't anything like me. I tried not to think about it but I just couldn't move on.\n\nI tried to talk to him about it but I just couldn't get over the messages, no matter how hard I tried. He reassured me that he loves me and that he'd try to bring back what we had in the beginning but besides about a week or so of occasional messages when he's at work, he didn't put in much effort. I try not to get upset about it though because I know he's trying to make me happy but I just can't help it. Now I'm just left wondering if I'm really happy in the relationship or if I just convinced myself I am for our sons sake.\n\nI'm now finally realizing that I don't think I want this anymore and I don't feel the same way I used to about him but I don't know what to do. I'm still trying to recover fully from the pregnancy and my son is only 8 months, along with my intense social anxiety, I'm not able to hold down a job and even if I could, anything I bring in would go straight to a babysitter for my son. I also don't have anywhere else to go. All my family either doesn't have room for me or doesn't know the situation and I don't want to have to explain to everyone why I need a place to stay. I don't really have any friends I could stay with either so I'd still be stuck loving with my husband for who knows how long which would only be incredibly awkward and I feel like would only make things worse.\n\nI don't know knkw if there's a way out of this for me or if I'm just stuck but at least for now, I'm just trying to hold it all together, pretending that everything is okay so the little bit of normalcy that's still left doesn't fall apart. I feel like the more I try to be the rock that holds our family together though, the more it falls apart and the more I fall apart. I wish I had a way out of this...",

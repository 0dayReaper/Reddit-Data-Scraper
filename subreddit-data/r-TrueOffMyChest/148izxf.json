I asked what he meant, he called her old, fat, \"used up\" and bitchy.\nHe's normally not that type of guy, but getting a glimpse of how he really felt about her made me lose a lot of respect for him.\n\nWe had a mild argument about it before we went home. We didn't talk for a few days, until he messaged me today apologizing about it.\nI don't think I'm going to continue being his friend.\n\nHonestly I'm more mad at him for putting me in this situation than him not liking my girlfriend or whatever. He crossed a line and forced me to make a choice.",

None of my wife's friends are rude or insulting when they tell her why they don't like me!",

A good friend will voice their concerns about your significant other, but because they\u2019re GENUINELY CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR WELL BEING.  In this type of conversation you use facts - not opinions. \n\nHe took some low blows critiquing her like that. And by him saying \u201cshe\u2019s old, fat, and used up\u201d he\u2019s being shallow, and also insulting you.  His undertone implies there\u2019s something wrong with you for liking her - what\u2019s wrong with you for staying with someone so \u201cunattractive\u201d?\n\nHe wasn\u2019t being being a friend at all - let alone a good one.

I told him,  this isn't a clean break.   You'll get back with her again at least for a little while.   I'm not going to shit talk your girlfriend.   They did get back together. \n\nShe hated me after he said I was the only one that didn't shit talk her.   In her crazy ass toxic mind I was the only one that did hate her.   All his other friends shit talked her because they wanted to cheer him up.   I kept my opinions to myself because what I thought was too bad to say. \n\nGuess what she convinced this guy to quit his really good job and left him when the money ran out.   Took half of everything too.  We all always hated her.   We all knew how she was.   \n\nMy friend and I still don't talk.   Feel bad for him.",

In this case it sounds like OP's friend might be jealous of his relationship. That is often a factor. The post just made me think of my poor gf who is stuck with a pompous and rude POS and my reluctance to speak my thoughts about him to her. She's actually lost friends that she's cut off because they've spoken the truth to her about him.\n\nThis POS propositioned a woman guest at a party I had with his wife across the room. I found out because she asked me about him being married and wasn't that his wife....ugh, yeah. I never said anything to her because I KNOW that she'll find a way to excuse him and the embarrassment/shame might result in her cutting me off as well.\n\nThere are a lot of people who will protect their abusers.",

He knew them very well. He knew how mean, classist and shitty they could be. He was a cool, hilarious guy who could have a dark sense of humor himself, but there\u2019s limits and it was their loss. I told my sister at the time, \u201cYou and your friends shit on each other\u2019s significant others when the other friend is not around, giving them nicknames and mocking them behind their backs. He knows this well. You messed with the woman that he loves. This is your fault.\u201d\n\nThey all felt really sad about it for years.

He got married to her and didn\u2019t invite them to the wedding and he doesn\u2019t allow them on his social media anymore.

And If you\u2019re genuinely concerned for a friend and their relationship,  those aren\u2019t the aspects you\u2019d bring up when trying to justify your opinion of them.

Which IN ANY CASE, isn\u2019t the way you try to help a friend or express concern, especially when based on the info given, the friend offered no specific examples or experiences they had when there was ample\nopportunity too.\n\nSo I ask again, what truth are you expecting to find in \u201cfat, old, and used up\u201d? What realistic scenario given the context and lack of explanation despite opportunity to do so, do you think could create a space for the friend to speak about OP\u2019s gf this way? Or are you just going to misuse the word misogynistic again to give benefit of the doubt?",

He's made a lot of changes that most people do when settling down with a family. \n\nHe crossed that friend out right after because of how she treated me. I respect that, and I respect you for honoring your gf the way you did. I'm sorry for your loss of friendship.",

Grooming generally implies one party was underage when the relationship began. I was a fully grown adult.\n\nPeople have different tastes in partners. One man's fat ugly woman is another man's dream girl, barring the most extreme deformities or something. There are few traits that are desirable to no one. So if it's not a problem in the relationship, it shouldn't be a problem for the friend.\n\nBitchy is also subjective as fuck. Without a specific behavior to point to, that could mean anything from \"she was in a bad mood one day\" to \"she's emotionally abusive\".\n\nYour comparison doesn't work very well.\n\nThat being said, it doesn't matter if the Internet thinks my friend was being a misogynist or not, it's still uncalled for to use that kind of language about your friend's partner without a very good reason.",

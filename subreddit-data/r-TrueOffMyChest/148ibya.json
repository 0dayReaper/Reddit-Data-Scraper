    "postText": "I have taken the dumb approach and thought I wouldn't worry about that until that moment comes but it's pretty much inevitable. I live in a third world country in Latin America, so leaving it's a privilege not many people have. My mother has been working her ass off to get money for us to finally leave and I'm so grateful for that. \n\nBut the thing is my life is here, my partner of 3 years is here and don't want to leave him. I realize it's unfair of me to ask him to wait for me almost 2 years until I have the money to get him out. Just to paint the picture, between plane tickets, passport, documents and other things it's up to 3k USD in a country where average wage is 30 USD, so yeah, it sucks. I'm afraid if tell him to wait for me he'll say yes and we'll be miserable for years of not being together. \n\nI have seen many of friends suffer this exact situation, they leave, their partner is left behind, there's all this promises of reunification that fade out within 6 months of being apart. I always thought that would never be me, that we would be stable enough to put up with that, but now that it is a real thing happening to me it doesn't seen so easy. My mother thinks we should break it off now so it doesn't hurt that much later. It's not that simple, this is the man I thought I would marry and have kids with.\n\nIt's a difficult situation I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. I just needed to vent. I have perfectly clear I'm leaving in less than a year and sadly he'll be left behind. I just hope our love is strong enough to resist it because I wouldn't want to spend the rest of my life with anyone else.",

            "comment": "Your situation is definitely scary. I can understand almost every emotion you're feeling as I did something very similar recently. \n\nYou owe it to yourself to look forward. Once you actually move, you'll be in an entirely different place. New people, new language, new currency, new food, new everything. \n\nYou should absolutely take this for what it is; a privilege. I've moved countries 3 times in my life, and each time I was terrified of what's to come, and so upset about what I was leaving behind. The world is a beautiful place with countless things to offer. Once you've seen some of that, if you're still unhappy, you'll always have the option to move back. \n\nYou're worried about your relationship, and that's natural. I've seen dozens of relationships where someone's moved across the world and they still make a few hours for each other every day, counting down the days. If the love is there, and you both want the same goal, then it'll work out in the end. I won't lie, being long distance for years is definitely hard, and there are some days you'll cry and want to drop everything to move back. I promise in the end it'll be worth it. In the event that it doesn't work out, you have your whole life ahead of you in an entirely new place. \n\nFrom what I can tell, you're still pretty young (or at least not old enough to get married / have kids / stay with your partner). Don't get strung down by this. If you're still a teenager then odds are this isn't the love of your life. Break-ups suck, and moving isn't usually pleasant, but don't let this ruin the last few steps into a new world.",

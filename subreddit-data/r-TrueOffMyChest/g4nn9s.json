All that for 3,000 dead, and these protestors aren't screaming in the streets and blocking hospital entrances. \n\nNow imagine the Pentagon, two skyscrapers, and four jets were instead ten Pentagons, twenty skyscrapers, and forty jets...and you still will not have come close to the number of people this virus has *already* killed in the US alone. As of this writing, the CDC has confirmed over 41,000 deaths directly from COVID, and that's not even close to the real toll. It doesn't include all the false negatives from unreliable tests, all the people who couldn't get tests, all the people who died of COVID at home trying to stay out of the ER, and all the people having heart attacks and strokes and perforated ulcers who died at home trying to tough it out because they figured their chances were better with their age and comorbidities staying away from the plague sanitariums that our hospitals have been forced to become. \n\nIt also doesn't include all the people who are going to die because of delayed chemo, delayed operations, transplants that won't come in time, and all the cancelled glucose tolerance tests and cardiac stress tests and mammograms and screening colonoscopies and cancer post-treatment follow-up surveillance imaging that now won't happen until they're too late, because every hospital now specializes in one virus to the exclusion of all else. \n\nAnd now you're pissed off because someone is telling you to keep your distance for a little while longer? Are you fucking kidding me? Haven't you done enough damage and killed enough people already?",

Agreed though.\n\nEdit: Yes, another thing I forgot to mention is the fact that COVID-19 has no physical form we can be angry at for purposely giving this virus to people. It\u2019s pretty much an accident on different government\u2019s parts. With 9/11, however, we had a whole group of people to get mad at.l for purposely destroying and killing people.\nWe as people get mad all the time for everything. So, while we have no exact people to be mad at with COVID-19, I feel like we should remember that some people will find people to be mad at. Trump is a big contender for someone many are mad at (which, in my opinion, is reasonable). Hell, some in America are extremely mad at people they even suspect to be Chinese. I think that\u2019s an unreasonable anger, but humans will find other humans to pin the blame on, whether it\u2019s right or wrong factually and morally.\n\nThank you all for the responses. This is a great discussion OP has brought up, and I think we\u2019re all adding great points to it.",

With this, people are out of jobs, people's unemployment checks are \"processing\" so they're not getting money, the stimulus checks are backed up till July, the loans promised to businesses only made it to 25% of promised applicants, etc. In short, people still have bills to pay but no money to pay them with.\n\nLocal food banks are saying that 75% of the people that went this week were first time customers. In some areas, people had to start lining up for food banks a full day before they opened. Like, do you realize how insane that is?\n\nI'm for quarantine, but I understand the other side. The government is telling people they need to stay inside, they can't go to work, but the government isn't really doing much to make that sustainable. You can't have your cake and eat it too. You either enforce a quarantine and give people enough money to feed their families and pay the bills, or you don't have a quarantine and people die. But this halfway crap the government is pulling? No, that's dumb.\n\nEdit: I typed this while tired, so I should clarify now that I understand that it is the federal government in charge of financial security for citizens, while the state government is responsible for enforcing the quarantines!",

The governments although didn\u2019t react fast enough have done a good job at trying to keep the economy from plummeting and leaving millions homeless and below the poverty line. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sure European and other countries have done similar things, but the fact that the US is soooooo conservative that some would rather die than get a $1200 stimulus check.

Certainly - the unemployment insurance doesn't cover healthcare and there are still large gaps of what people were making vs. what they're getting in the crisis. Could we use universal healthcare in this damn country? YES!!!!! But did the US government just hand everyone $1200 bucks and walk away whistling down the lane? No, it's just somehow the $1200 check overshadowed every single part of that bill, it was the vocal minority of that Bill.\n\nAdditionally, since I'm an optimist, I'm praying that the US uses this moment to finally fund our government correctly (Better computers and equipment at state unemployment offices), and make the push towards universal healthcare in whatever form that looks like.",

There isn't enough time in the day to re explain 12 years of general education so they can finally figure out how a progressive tax system works. It hilarious explaining it to them and slowly watching their face turn to disappointment as they realize they have no idea what's going on. Usually at this point it turns to conspiracy theories about the moon landing was fake, creationism over evolution and how I've been brainwashed by the mainstream media into believing the new world order bullshit.",

This is where that argument comes from. The problem is, it ignores all the other ways people pay taxes, like payroll tax, consumption tax, estate tax, etc. Stuff like Social Security and Medicare comes from payroll tax. Not paying income tax doesn't affect that. Right now, the people whose wallets are least affected by paying taxes in the US are billionaires. They have the lowest tax rate in the nation.",

Most people dont even form their own opinions, they are spoon fed by the talking heads and forced into 1 of 2 options. Maybe we should question why that might be instead of going at each other over differences in opinion that don't matter. The response is this way not because ppl view it as communism .. The response is this way because the political system caters to money and corporations. 80% of the relief fund for citizens is going to several thousand milllionaires with an average benefit of $1.7 million. While 10x more is given to corporations and the fed is willing to use \"infinite amounts of money\" to save wall st and actually buy stocks to keep them afloat.. This country has been hijacked and people are being played like a fiddle to argue over whatever inane bullshit comes up this week, while deep systemic and societal problems are overlooked.",

We can disagree politically, economically, socially and still have meaningful conversations and come to good solutions. These problems are much more nuanced than red vs blue, there are no clear cut issues in life and thinking otherwise is just ignorance.\n\nI have seen reps called things like poor, stupid, inbred, etc and especially recently with this quarantine situation. Who do you think are the ones most impacted by these types of situations.. It is not the person living in NYC/major cities, who is currently working from home or maybe they dont even need to work at this moment to get by.. Those are not the people who are feeling this most. \n\nThere are too many who are deemed essential getting paid dirt, they've been getting paid dirt and have no other support in life. I have friends on the verge of being homeless or not eating now because no one gives a fuck about you if you're not living on the coasts. And the vast majority of relief money is going to rich individuals or big business. Everyone should be pissed the fuck off now. \n\nIf the government wants to force you to stay home, shouldn't some consideration be given to your needs and security? Other countries are making sure their citizens and companies who act in good faith are cared for, so why the fuck are we handing out 80% of the citizen relief fund to millionaires and the money set aside for corporations 10x what people get? Why is the fed willing to inject an \"infinite amount\" of money and make sure the stock markets has it's best time ever, but the average American is left to be devastated? Americans were just recovering from the last time we had to bail out companies and paying their ceos record bonuses.. That is just recovery to a point that was already stagnant and leaving people desperate. \n\nThis was not a one sided affair, both sides are guilty of using tragedy for political clout and to pad pockets. We have two sides who are told to hate each other from the very top of the platforms and media.. Should we not question why that might be? Actions speak louder than words, and for all the accusations flying around, all politicans have proven they are equally guilty in eroding the average persons quality of life.",

It's just proof that when push comes to shove, most of these people will never actually inconvenience themselves or go out of their way for the betterment of others.  As SOON as something specific is asked of them it's all push back and bullshit about how this is all fake anyway or defeatist excuses about how what they do won't make a difference.  It definitely is discouraging if you assume they'll have the same attitude if it ever came to taking action for climate change (and I see no reason that isn't a safe assumption).  If people literally can't just stay inside their own homes for a few weeks, what fucking chance do we have to make any real changes?",

This past weekend since the \"Liberate Virginia, protect your 2nd amendment!\" tweets I'm fucking livid. Every last Republican roach from the President on down to his bobbleheads on Fox News to the idiots in the streets with guns can get fucked. They want to scream about patriotism and wrap themselves in the flag. Yet can't endure a few weeks of hardship? Where are those famous bootstraps? Where are all the fiscally responsible Republicans who saved for a rainy day? \n\nThose rural towns these idiots are going back to are not equipped to deal with a sudden surge of positive cases. The only hospital in the area is probably an hour away or more and only has half a dozen beds. I know mine does. We have 4 ICU beds and not enough staff to even handle that. So when these idiots inevitably get sick and their loved ones come in, what happens? They die. Then their neighbor dies. Then that healthy young man in the prime of his life dies. Then they make a sad post on Facebook and a GoFundMe to help pay for the burial and hospital cost and we package them up and move them out so the next moron can come in and die in their place. \n\nThat's the whole fucking point of these measures in the first place yet our idiot in Chief can't string together one God damn coherent fucking sentence to explain that to people. Instead, he does the exact opposite and encourages it. \n\nWhat the fuck America? What the fuck happened to us. I'm embarassed and angry and just fucking sick of this shit.",

For all the virtue signalling that goes on on this site, it can be quite shoehorning. Sikhs good, Muslims bad, Indians smelly, conservatives bad, murica bad, Aussies good, China bad etc. Etc. Once a narrative has stuck and proves it can get you upvotes, you best be sure that shit is gonna get regurgitated till hell freezes over.",

Trump, his disastrous mishandling is why this is so bad here. \n\nAnd another key difference with 9/11 is the response of the government itself. Firstly they took it seriously and secondly fanned the flames of everyone's anger. They then went even further and deliberately used it to invade Iraq and declare a global war on terror. \n\nHere Trump is trying to blame China, and they do share blame, but he's doing it to deflect criticism from himself which is a perpetual theme for him. \n\nHis admin knew back when this started thanks to intelligence. Any other president would have convened our top medical experts to work out with intel what was going on and what we should do about it. Instead his people went and sold their shares in the stock market.\n\nThen there's the media, with 9/11 their coverage was an important part of everyone knowing who was to blame and stirring up anger. Now we've been in an information war, a feature of the cold civil war our politics has descended into.\n\nThere is something to be said for the difference of a virus and human enemy being the attacker. But it didn't have to be this bad, we used to have response mechanisms in place and trump dismantled them and defunded the CDC on top of that. \n\nHe's dismantling the government, he ran on cleaning out corruption but those are the only people he's left in power, and this is what that looks like. Total abject failure to respond.",

People\u2019s live are over. I\u2019m not even talking about those who died from the virus, I\u2019m talking about people who were living paycheck to paycheck, and even people who had savings and thought they were financially secure. Their income is gone, their savings are gone or will be soon, and they are going to be in debt for the rest of their lives. I hate to be the voice of darkness here, but a lot of people are not going to financially recover from this. Tens of millions of people just had their lives trashed, and went from a place of security, or at least routine, to a state of hopelessness and uncertainty. \n\nBefore you make stupid, snarky posts about \u201ccan\u2019t you just stay inside\u201d, consider that maybe people are desperate to start fixing their lives. No, the protests weren\u2019t carried out responsibly, and no, this is probably not a safe time to reopen yet. But let\u2019s at least stop pretending that this is about people who want to go have a beer. I think it\u2019s understandable people want to get started on fixing their lives. Maybe let\u2019s explain why that would be unsafe right now, instead of making posts trashing desperate, scared people who just want normalcy back.",

Ditto for TSA procedures. Annoying, but hardly a limitation of freedom.\n\nOn the other hand, the Virus and the pathetic response of governments around the world has had drastically altered our life.\n\nWe're basically on house arrest \"for our own good\", but it's just because healthcare systems have been gutted by private enterprise or by cutting public funding or by both (depending on the country).\n\nSo with ICU being understaffed and underequipped, the only way to handle a flu with a relatively higher complication rate has become \"stay indoors\". The whole \"flatten the curve\" is the ultimate surrender, the resignation to our advanced society being unable to contain a slightly more aggressive virus. And now we're living as if it were the fucking Black Death or something.\n\nYeah, I can definitely see why many are frustrated and aren't down with being kept inside because governments have failed them at something you wouldn't expect to be a problem in 2020 in developed countries.\n\n(P.S.

Do I think this is completely over blown? Also yes. 0.012% of Americans have died because of Covid-19. Believe it or not, not every single city in America is a hotspot like New York. \n\nDuring 9/11 the government didn\u2019t tell us we couldn\u2019t go to work, we couldn\u2019t buy gardening tools, we couldn\u2019t go to somebody else\u2019s house. In Ohio we have close to 1 million people who have filed for unemployment with less than 300,000 actually being approved. Our (jackass) of a Governor pushes 40,000 \u201cessential\u201d jobs like Walmart, Kroger, and Amazon while killing small business. \n\nWhat is the best plan? Wait 12-18 month for a vaccine and send our economy into a depression? Or isolate the elderly and high risk population, while taking social distancing serious so people can go back to work. Just because there\u2019s a virus doesn\u2019t mean that the world stops spinning. People still have bills to pay, mouths to feed, and lives to live. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen the videos from food bank lines that are miles long. At the end of the day there\u2019s no good answer, any decisions made with have drastic consequences either way. At some point you have to decide the cure can\u2019t be worse than the virus, just my opinion.",

Would saying \u201conly 3,000 people died on 9/11 and went to war.... over 1.5 million die each year and you still want to be able to drive? Of course not. No one would advocate that. But that\u2019s what you are doing. Leaving your house every day is a risk. In fact you are far more likely to die from driving to the hospital for treatment than even catching covid-19, let alone dying from it. Again, this comparison is non sense and idiotic.",

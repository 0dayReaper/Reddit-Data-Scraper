I never want to feel again,and I know now that I was a fool to feel anything in the first place. No one wants to keep a broken thing, it's a novelty for a time sure but it's broken. Useless. A curiosity that belongs in a museum with the other broken things and dead bodies to be gawked at and speculated about at a distance.\n\nI hate what I am more than anything else in the world.",

That's a very painful experience and I don't blame you for feeling sad and angry. How long have you been feeling this way? Have you talked to anyone about it? But please don't hate yourself or think that you're broken or useless. You're not. You're a valuable and worthy person who deserves love and happiness. You have a lot to offer to the world and to yourself. \n\nFeeling is not a weakness or a mistake. It's a strength and a gift. It means you're alive and you have a heart. Don't let one person's opinion of you define you or stop you from feeling again. There are other people who will appreciate you and accept you for who you are. You have the power to heal and grow from this experience. I hope you can find some support and comfort in your life.",

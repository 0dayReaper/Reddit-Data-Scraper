I've only ever tried being in a relationship once, but I lasted literally less than a week in it because it made me so scared that I couldn't concentrate on anything else and ended up physically ill. I don't even know why?? I was (and am) very good friends with them, I've never been sexualy assualted or anything like that. I hate that I'm like this but don't know where to start to get over it.",

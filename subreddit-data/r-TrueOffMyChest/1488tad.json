    "postText": "I went on a first date today and I was weirdly and uncharacteristically excited and anxious for this date but i brushed off the feelings as simply being nervous that i was being picked up from my house with everyone home, my date compliments me when i get in the car, a compliment about my voice and throughout the date he\u2019s polite, very polite and somewhat talkative, though our senses of humors don\u2019t seem to line up as well as i would like, but he\u2019s a gentleman and i feel, safe and comfortable and i start wanting to be close to him, as we get deeper into the date we talk about our more private thoughts and our childhood and it turns out we have a lot in common and i felt myself wanting to be close to him physically but maybe i was just cold or maybe i\u2019m lonely i don\u2019t know and as when talked i began to speak more about my experiences with rejection and loneliness and never dating anyone and it brought back some bad memories and feelings and i started to be negative when he was offering some counterpoint to some views i expressed on myself, he seemed to like me less and when i realized he had not tried to kiss me or touch me despite being in a dark car with me i wanted to cry for some reason, i don\u2019t know why, and he mentioned that he\u2019s not looking for anything but he\u2019s also not opposed to anything, i don\u2019t know why but for some reason through i pained me i lied and said that i\u2019m not interested in romantic relationships and i had said yes when he said it was good i wasn\u2019t in one then since i don\u2019t want one, and when he dropped me off home he tried to hug me i think and walk me to my door bc of a lose large dog but i ended up rejecting both despite a part of me wanting to say yes and closing the door too soon while he was talking, i don\u2019t know why i acted like such a dick towards the end, what\u2019s wrong with me? i\u2019m so confused with myself, he was so nice and he payed for everything and it\u2019s well within his right to reject me and i know that, it\u2019s not anger or wanting to \u201cpunish\u201d him, not really and i know the small feelings i had like that were unreasonable but i don\u2019t even know why i feel angry towards him, i\u2019m so confused about everything right now\u2026.",

            "comment": "I think you have some deep hurt that you need to resolve. You are expecting a rejection despite his actions, so you reject him first. It\u2019s likely that you will find yourself experiencing rejection again and again if you don\u2019t deal with the root cause of it - the hurt and source of insecurity. I would recommend to start with some counseling. All the best to you. *Hugs*",

He didn't match your energy after a certain point, that's okay and your right to reject people who don't match what you want which I think you did at the end. but if you want to expand your dating pool maybe try to go a little slower.",

    "postText": "Please don't be judgemental and keep an open mind. I love this man to death, breakup is not on the table.\n\nBackground: We've been together for roughly 4\u00bd years. We are long distance as I am in university and hes working. He smokes weed regularly, I'm a social smoker. I have no issues with the weed. It does not incapacitate him, he refuses to see a doctor for deoression/anxiety. His dad is an alcoholic and heaaavyyy stoner. Both indulge in shrooms for mindfulness.\n\nI consider myself very open minded. My family is the stereotypical Christian conservative type, and not the good one, and I'm glad that didn't settle in me. I was and still am wary of drugs. Weed is the only one I can get past. The rest is poison. I first smoked weed at his when I was just over 18yo. We tried shrooms on matric holiday but it didn't do anything for me (we didn't fast). We tried again about a year later and I had a very fucking awful trip. Sank into a nasty pit of depression and safe to say I avoid it like a plague\n\nHe has expressed avid interest in it though, and frequently mentions traveling to places where shrooms is a big part of their culture. We had more than a few arguments about ut because he is convinced it opend the doors of reality for him and I think its just putting him in an impaired, delusional state. Yes the colours were pretty but it was sych a small part of the overall visceral torture. I eventually told him that I want no part in this part of his life, and that the conversations are so often that it feels as if he has an unhealthy connection with it. He stopped talking about it but itss resurfaced again.\n\nLong story short, we had a fallout tonight because he said he wants to travel to Amsterdam be ause of their weed and shrooms culture. I said I just want to go sightseeing. He then said we will, just in many dimensions. I told him that I don't want to travel with a partner high on hallucinogenics, that I want sober memories and that he can indulgein it in at his own expense and time. He got super upset and defensive and again said that our experiences with the drug is different. That I shouldn't force my views onto him and that he wants to experience life with me; I dont have to take it. He got pissed of when I said I dont want to be tripsitter and I kept repeating that he can do what he wants just keep me out of it. He said why bother traveling together when I'll just be making him suppress this integrated part of him (mindfulness, self awareness, meditation, etc etc) and that he'll travel alone. And that he isn't going to cut out this part of his mind for me.\n\nWe don't fight often... we talk things through like adults but he kind of shut down. He ended our call and messeged me for the rest of the fight.  I'm not a prude, and it pisses me off that he's making this his hill to die on. I don't get why the fuck this is such an issue. If I loved painting men nude but it made him uncomfortable, then I wouldnt force him to watch me paint or hold my hand whilst I observemy model. Tf?\n\nTo add - I'm studying for a profession where affiliation with illicit drugs (weed is legal) would get me in *BIG* trouble. Although there is zero links towards me and him indulging, I'm still don't like it. He has also mentioned that the science around it will change and it will be more normalized, maybe even used as therapy",

And I don\u2019t indulge anymore but my SO also has expressed interest and probably will do it soon. I won\u2019t be around for it because it\u2019s just not my thing, but I would never stop him because it\u2019s not my decision, it\u2019s his. \n\nPeople have broken up over lesser things but the more you try to control, the more the relationship will fracture. If you want it to work, you\u2019ll have to compromise and find a middle ground.",

I also said that if he feels like sightseeing, he can do so at his own accord and I won't say anything about it. I just don't want a partner dissociating next to me and having weird nonsensical conversation. I don't find that fun or entertaining at all",

And if it\u2019s a hill he\u2019s willing to die on and not compromise on\u2026might be the beginning of the end. I hope it isn\u2019t. But from my experience, once someone begins to really experiment more into psychedelics, it\u2019s usually something they do for a while - not necessarily forever though! Once me and my friends left our 20s, the draw wasn\u2019t there but you\u2019re both young and there\u2019s a lot to experience during your 20s so just something to think about.",

He seems to have a better relationship with spirit medicine, and trying to suppress his desire to explore the infinite mind will only push him away. Psychedelics are physically safer than pot, so if you're worried about him overdosing don't be, it's virtually impossible to do.",

Friend's brother, though, went harder at the shrooms and in the end never came back, spent his entire adult life in institutions.\n\nI don't think travelling to take shrooms is a great idea, it's a waste of travel for a start.  Losing control in a strange city in public is also disrespectful to the locals and makes you vulnerable to criminality.",

To some they are magical and I know many that have become obsessed with them on their path to self healing an enlightenment and rightly so. The evidence for their benefits is stacking up high.\n\nThe other side is that yes, if you\u2019re both going on holiday together, he should also be mindful of your needs. Maybe some sightseeing together, but also some time alone for him to have his trip.\n\nIt seems like good communication here would clear the air. Sit down, tell him you\u2019re willing to be more accepting of his shrooms, only if he is willing to accept the fact you don\u2019t like them and maybe not to raise them as often.\nI also think a conversation about them might help. Why does he like them so much? What is it he is trying to achieve?",

Just because he's with you doesn't make it \"your time\", and you don't really get or deserve a veto on how you spend time together, anymore so than he does or should.  \n\n\nMushroom are a miracle drug.  As someone else pointed out, the evidence for their medicinal and mental health properties is really starting to add up, to become... pretty conclusive; it's fine if they're not for you, but in the face of all that data, trying to pretend like it's \"just an altered state of mind\" is willfully ignorant, that's your narrative, but not really reflective of what they are, how they work, or how they help people.   \n\n\nI'd say figure out how to compromise or go your separate ways.  Your current approach is all about what you want, and your values, and imposing those on him.  I'm a bit repulsed by the \"he can do what he wants on his time\" rhetoric, that's kind of gross, ALL OF HIS TIME is his time, and you can either decide to stay with him or not, but you don't get to decide what together-time means, you have no ownership, none whatsoever, of his time when you're around, and your whole approach to talking about that is entitled and weird, straight up.  (All of your time is yours too, for the record, but he doesn't appear to be insisting that you get high, while you appear to be very much insisting he doesn't.  You don't get to do that.  You can say \"you get high too much and I don't want to be around you\", that's your business, you own your time, but that's kind of all you can say.   \n\n\nEvery time I see this kind of thing, I think the person should be single, not because their partner is bad, but because... well... they are.  They're not mature enough for a real relationship, they don't understand the way that respect and autonomy is supposed to work.  \"I don't like this\" automatically because \"you shouldn't do that\" and not \"I should get over myself\", despite the latter option being infinitely healthier.",

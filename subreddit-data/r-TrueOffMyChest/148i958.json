    "postText": "hey this is the first time i am on reddit and i actually don't know how it works lol.I decided to share my story here because i listen to your podcast and i love it. So i am an 18(F) , indian. I don't know if you're aware but our education system is fucked. After completing our school, basically 12th grade we have to go for our college. So, when i was in 11th i started preparing for an entrance exam that is held after completing school to pursue mbbs in my country. And i prepared so hard for that but unfortunately i wasn't able to clear it in my first attempt.. So,i decided to take a gap year to prepare for that again because i was sure that i wanted to be a doctor only, it was(is) my passion. So in total, i worked my ass off for three years straight(15,16,17) yep my teenage years  and i feel i missed out in a lot of things . When everyone around me was partying, i was at my home studying as much as i could.\nBut at the end , i fucked up my exam once again, it's actually an omr test and i marked wrong answers because idk maybe i was anxious because my mom &amp; dad gave only this year to do what i wanted to and i didn't wanna fuck it up, but i did. Also , South asian countries have different family values, we do not exactly move out from our parents home at 18. We don not have to do part time jobs , our parents do all of that but we have to take care of our parents till they die(just making that clear if someone is not aware of .)\nI was devastated because this is all I dreamt of, i prepared for this exam for 3 whole years, never used social media ,lost all of my friends and now im here sitting in my room and writing this because i feel so alone.I thought, okay i don't have friends but atleast i have a family, my mom and dad, right?\nNope, my dad started saying awful stuff to me that i am a failure and all that ( i don't wanna go deep into it) . I was so close to my dad, i was a daddy's girl and now my favourite person has shown his back to me when i need him the most.\nI was never close with my mom or my sibling so i don't expect anything from them. And now when i am sitting here , i feel so lonely. I ditched all my friends just so i could pursue my dream but here I've failed in all aspects. I feel , am a terrible friend, a terrible daughter, a failure and what not. I belong to a middle class family so i can't afford to go out if the country. Honestly all this was in my heart all along and i just wanted to share it with someone. I don't know if anyone's reading this or not. I hope I feel better soon :)",

I understand different cultures have different family values, but sometimes those values themselves prevent any form of accountability or growth. \n\nThis experience may just be a sign provided to you to reflect on your life and what you yourselves value the most, not what your family values. \n\nAnd I wi admit I have no idea if any neighboring countries provide this, but see if there is someone that will provide grants and better opportunities to thrive and pursue your dream of being a doctor. \n\nJust remember how people treat you when your at your lowest, cause when you\u2019re at your highest they may act as if they\u2019ve always been good to you. \n\nBest of luck. \u270c\ufe0f",

What are your options now? \n\nAnd I promise you that your Dad still loves you!",

            "comment": "Hey there, I am about 10 years older than you. And I would say India has a very messed up system of pushing people into careers that they don\u2019t want. You feel that you have disappointed people and that you are a burden on your parents. You are NOT a burden on your father but YOU need to decide what career you want to go into. If you have not been able to cross the NEET boundary, perhaps somewhere in your heart you do not want to be a doctor.\n\nTake my example, I really did not want to be an engineer. But I joined the rat race. Gave my exams. Failed JEE. Leeched my father to go to a third rate private university. Graduated with a degree that I have no idea how to use. Joined a random company, became a monkey that codes. Joined university again for a degree I don\u2019t want ( but in a country that I decided to go ) and finally, I understand that I want to be a zoologist (and it\u2019s really late for a career change now).\n\nTLDR: Really evaluate if you want to be a doctor. Why do you want to be a doctor?",

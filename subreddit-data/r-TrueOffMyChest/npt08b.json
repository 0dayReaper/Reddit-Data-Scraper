    "postText": "So many companies are putting out PR to set the stage for forcing employees back into the office. Why? \n\nPreviously, businesses said full time remote work would ruin productivity and the cost to put the infrastructure in place was too high. Well, covid forced the infrastructure to be put in place and drops in productivity didn\u2019t happen. Now business and government are saying they want to preserve company and work culture. And they\u2019re making all these veiled threats about losing out on promotions and being converted to contract employees. Wtf?\n\nI have never been more productive or happy since I started working from home. A small minority of people want to go back to the office. My company has the surveys to prove it. Why force people to do something they don\u2019t want to do, that actually makes them LESS productive, exhausted, and sucks up their free time? Commuting is terrible for the environment, and for employees\u2019 wallets. Why force us back into the office so a vocal minority can have their social hour back at lunch?\n\nI don\u2019t give a shit about company culture. I like having extra money in my pocket. I like not having to spend an extra two hours of my day sitting in traffic. Fuck these CEOs and managers that are forcing employees back into offices because of \u201cculture.\u201d",

I live in a major metro area, and the average commute to get anywhere is an hour. So if I\u2019m considering a contract where I have to be onsite, it\u2019s going to need to pay at least 25% more to make up for the fact that my average \u201cworkday\u201d will be 10 hours rather than eight. Start factoring commute time into what you make, and those remote jobs are gonna look better and better.",

At most you have time to run to the grocery store, go home, cook dinner, clean up, shower, and get in bed if you want to get 8 hours of sleep. The \"compromise\" is you learn to sleep on the bus, and it gives you a little more time during the week.\n\nWhich is barely a compromise. It fucking sucks. And by the end of the week you are absolutely exhausted because you keep getting yourself up after 5-6 hours of sleep, getting ready for work, sleepily driving to the bus stop, and passing the fuck out again.",

Heck you could even do a hybrid solution where multiple workers come in 1-2 days a week and can all use the same desk.\n\nI remember when the pandemic began and the roads were especially empty. The air really did seem cleaner. That preserves finite resources and saves lives (accidents, lung diseases). \n\nThat said, you are correct that *sometimes* there are reasons that having a physical presence can be important and remote work does have some security concerns.",

But, as more companies look at doing that, the various landlords for those office buildings probably started negotiating harder on the cost to break the lease. If they start letting people go too easily, they'll have too much space to fill and not enough potential tenants. Coupled with the fact that some of the people responsible for making that decision prefer the office setting over work from home, they chose to force everyone back in the office over eating the cost of the office space(or the cost of breaking the lease) while letting everyone stay home.",

However managers didn\u2019t want to hear about it and maybe if you were good boy/girl you could have 2 days of home office in one year as a benefit! Wow so generous!\n\nHowever corona proved it - there is even more jobs that you could easily do from home. People are doing it even better and they are happier. Why we can\u2019t change this and keep this permanent when it\u2019s clearly obvious? It\u2019s not clear to me.... it only shows that lot of managers and bosses have this wannabe God syndrome and they can\u2019t deal with a fact that people could be happy in work.",

Before that there had been a new boomer age VP installed and one of the first things she did was cut our work from home days from 2 down to 1. She hates work from home and has never explained why.\n\nOur company also does employee engagement metrics. During the pandemic it was polled how many people like working from home. 94% responded that they prefer it. Employee engagement/job satisfaction was up to 80% from a 5 year average of 60%. Most of all, for the first time in a decade our loss ratio dropped below 100%. Employee happiness was up, performance was up, people loved work from home.\n\nLast month we had a town hall meeting in which they summarized all this information and then immediately announced a full return to the office by July with work from home 1 day a week and only in the case of pre-arrangement with your manager for a specific purpose.\n\nThe stigma of working from home exists. I don\u2019t understand it but apparently its strong enough to ignore positive internal metrics that show work from home has great benefits and no measurable downsides.",

I'm a hard worker, so when I was at home I still busted ass. Boss said in my review no problem with you working from home. You still produced. \n\nI kinda thought too the average person would fuck off if working from home, but the company somehow met and exceeded all forecast for pandemic 2020 year. Our workforce basically proved out - albeit under forced circumstances - that they are 100% capable and willing to do work from home. \n\nFucking told all us managers last week it's time to start \"Implementing a plan to get your entire teams back into the office full time\". How do I tell these guys this lol? There's literally no logic here.\n\nLike I said, I work all day anyway so it's a trivial issue to me. But it kinda pisses me off.",

It's all bullshit so some middle manager or VP can stroke their fucking ego and say \"I'm in power.\"\n\nProblem (not really): \"Why are we paying for water services?\" (25/mo per location for 4 locations.. $100/mo for the company 100 gallons per location)\nSolution: Buy pallet of water bottles from costco, people will ration them accordingly for the entire company. Cost? $780 for the pallet for the whole company. People were taking whole flats of water bottles home, water ran out in less than a week. \n\nSolution? Buy 2 Pallets.\n\nThis went on for 6 months.\n\nAll because someone didn't like paying for the water services and saw it as wasteful as \"people drank too much water\"\n\nPeople ended up drinking more of the bottled stuff and even stealing the flats of bottled water. At a massive cost increase.\n\nSpent somewhere close to $4600 over 12 months for the whole company. After all one pallet is 72 gallons. A far cry from 100/mo for the entire company.\n\nWhat a fucking savings. Spent $4000 to \"save\" $600.\n\nIt was back to water services. \n\nThe funnier part, is they had one location that tapped into the water lines for the water fountain and it was a $5/mo filter service. They had that removed in favor of bottles.\n\n\nThat's when I learned none of this has to do with cost saving measures or anything. But whimsical bullshit and ego.\n\nThis is why they are pushing people back into offices. Whimsy and ego.",

Within 6 months all of us got fired for whatever petty reason he could come up with so he could replace us with new staff, and even heard him talk about how he's been with the company longer than most.\n\nWhen I worked in an office, we got a new COO, he fired *EVERYONE* who wasnt a lower ranking employee as fast as he could get away with. he'd get them to write up processes, then replace them with someone new. Same reason. He did not want anyone who helped start the company there, or anyone knowing more than him. Only the lowest upper management stayed on board, the people who were irreplaceable, but had no real sway on management. I knew a few of them. still there to this day, when we started, they were promised they could climb in the company. the last of them quit finally, he told me he never got a raise after that day and people got hired over him. \n\nMy boss got fired and I was going to be fired as soon as I finished my boss' project. I just quit because fuck them. lol.",

You spend a significant chunk of your life there.\n\nIf we start to work from home more often, than working for a company is just something you do, not something you are. It means less loyalty to the company and more options for the worker.\n\nI'm not saying this is a conscious effort from employers, but it could be what they're scared about, and why they're leaning on \"company culture\". That \"culture\" is the \"we're a family!\" BS companies try to push on us to keep us loyal and make us think twice before we consider getting another job elsewhere. If people lose that sense of \"company culture\" and \"oneness\" with the company then the companies will have to work harder to keep them (most likely by paying more).",

They do not want people happy and relaxed at home, they want you anxious on the freeway about being late for work... spending $ on gas and stress-buying Dunkin drive-thru... not listening to classical music and eating your healthy, homemade breakfast, wearing comfortable clothes, keeping your pet company, stretching between emails the recommended amount for the health of your body!\n\nExploitative, middle-manager slave morality is how they preserve the status-quo... yes, scarcity and \u201csurvival mode\u201d is an important component of their business model, it\u2019s not all about productivity. Exhaustion and precarity is how they convince workers to value someone else\u2019s business over their own interests. Think of the workers who refuse to unionize out of fear, or who are guilt-tripped into letting their paid sick / vacation days lapse year after year.\n\nA worker who is happy and has a healthy work-life balance is more likely to value their own time and contributions, and this clarity might cause them to advocate for their own interests. Oh no!\n\nThis is why NO ONE should pay attention to \u201cguilt trip\u201d think pieces about how there\u2019s sooo many available jobs, but no one wants to take them caus they are lazy and greedy on unemployment. I read something like this in the WSJ and it made me sick... I\u2019d like to see that journalist live on entry-level wages.\n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s mom had to apply for work to keep her UI benefits; thankfully, you aren\u2019t obligated to take a job that pays less than your previous income. It\u2019s ludicrous to argue that a 66 year-old woman should feel OBLIGATED to work at Home Goods for $7 an hour. \n\nIt\u2019s not that people don\u2019t want to work... a lot of people prefer the structure of having a job and like to make money! But if they want workers to take these jobs and perform well, maybe they should pay a living wage. Or perhaps with the incoming automation apocalypse, it\u2019s time for UBI... or at least a restructuring of the economy. \n\nWhen wages haven\u2019t increased in decades, as housing / cost of living steadily increases... yeah this causes a problem! In my opinion, the more people who refuse to work for starvation wages at McDonalds, the better. \n\nTL;DR do not be guilt tripped into valuing the profit of others over your own interests! Your boss doesn\u2019t care about you, so why care about taking time off when they\u2019re understaffed? If they are hiring frugally and overworking you, it\u2019s probably because the top positions are taking $50K raises. Take as much of your unemployment as you want... you\u2019re entitled to it and use this time and $ to invest in yourself and find a career that actually VALUES your contributions. \u270a",

This last year of remote working has shown us all that a lot of managers have essentially nothing to do if they aren\u2019t in person to micromanage you, which essentially means they\u2019re a high salary chunk of fat that could be cut. Naturally, they\u2019re going to sell the message upwards that it\u2019s vital to the company\u2019s success to get back to the office. In some cases, higher level management may even know this and doesn\u2019t want to have to justify meaningless positions, so it\u2019s just a lot easier to push everyone back.\n\nAt my company there\u2019s only one group pushing to go back ASAP: management.

Everyone who ate in the lunch room in close quarters all got covid. Except for the person I know. They told management to find better things to do and just started driving off during lunch and ate under a shade tree nearby so they couldnt have goons going out to the parking lot and taking pics of him \"abandoning his job\" because he didnt want to \"eat inside as a team\" so he \"drove out to get lunch\" and came back at the end of lunch. Needless to say they reduced the if office staff down to 10% and didnt bother him about eating lunch outside, in fact it became encouraged.",

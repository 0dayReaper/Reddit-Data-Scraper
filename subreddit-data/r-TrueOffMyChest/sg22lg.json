    "postText": "To start: \n\nI love this woman more than life itself. She is the most selfless, supportive, and loving person I have ever met. Every single day I am with her I am a better person for it. That being said:\n\nShe sleeps like an asshole. \n\nWe start all cuddled up like a Disney movie, snug as a bug in a rug. And then, when she falls asleep, we begin the nightly turf war that is our bed. \n\nShe will often start with a classic starfish maneuver, spreading her arms and legs to establish a beach head to begin her insurgence. She will then begin to slowly rotate her body in a counter clockwise fashion, until she is sleeping diagonally across the bed, establishing an ingress with her feet and legs. Then, with a classic pincer executed as ruthlessly as Hannibal himself, she brings her upper body forward, pinning me in and leaving me exactly 2 inches for my insomniac ass to try and sleep on. I then try to slowly slide out of bed, and sleep on her side, in which her reaction is to do the same thing 5 minutes later. \n\nI have tried everything. We bought a California King for our tiny bedroom. I establish a green zone with pillows. I have even gently picked her up and slid her to her side, to no avail. The thing is, I can\u2019t sleep in an empty bed anymore because I love this dummy so much. It has literally kept me up nights that I end up going to work with no sleep, and I can only sleep the next night out of sheer exhaustion. She also works hard, so I can\u2019t wake her up but fuck I am tired.",

Physical restraint is always an option and is just the cat's pajamas of fun but you also want to make sure your partner rests safely, comfortable and peaceful by your side.",

I'd push the doona onto her side of the bed, because she needed the doona and I prefer not to have it. Even asleep she'd burrow under the doona rather than fight me for my 10cm strip of the bed.",

And lol at the sleepover attempt- we did the same recently and I don\u2019t think either of us slept more than an hour total, in short snatches before his snoring or my moving or me \u201csleeping in a triangle\u201d (no idea but it greatly bothers him when I do it?) woke each other up. When we are kids we get our own rooms and beds, then grow up and get our own place and family and suddenly we have to share our room AND our bed with each other?! Not fair!",

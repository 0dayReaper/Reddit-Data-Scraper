    "postText": "There is audio of Amber Heard admitting she hit Johnny and that Johnny didn't hit her and STILL people act as if Amber was a victim.  Amber also sued Johnny for millions and only later said she would donate it to charity and STILL has not donated a cent.  And remember when Amber played a psychotic \"it was all me\" manipulator in All the Boys Love Mandy Lane?  Please tell me I'm not taking crazy pills.",

No one can make excuses for saying shitty things while drunk, or for being dependent on alcohol, but it doesn't absolve her of being an abuser, or him of being a victim of abuse.\n\nIt is disgusting that he's seen the backlash he has, that he has to fight so much harder. I remember when the news of their marriage came to light, I had baaaaad feelings about her... as a full blown feminist, the negative vibes I got from all this confused me deeply and I was ashamed to speak out about it. I genuinely felt that he was at a disadvantage and couldn't explain why.\n\nLo and behold, such a short time later, this news came to light. I was so sick over the accusations and definitely defaulted to believing her, as we are expected to, even though it didn't align with my prior instincts about their marriage.\n\nIt has been a huge learning experience for me, this roller coaster between one end of this spectrum to the other, having to recognize and respect the need for critical thinking, for the gray areas between extremes, for not blindly adhering to an ethos as dictated... being a feminist means defending men who are victimized. It means recognizing that women can also be abusers. It means knowing that abused men are disadvantaged.",

Both male and female abusers will try to make it seem like their victim is the abuser. They will try to get them in a paych hold or arrested and then hold that threat over them as a form of control. I've been working on a DV grant for years and when the woman is an abuser she almost always uses the police to threaten her partner. It makes it even harder and important to determine who the primary aggressor in the relationship. Also I've seen situations where sometimes they(male or female abuser)  instigate a situation where their victim has to physically fight back, but then they immediately call the police on them. I wouldnt be surprised if this was the case here too.",

So she is SOLIDLY in Aquaman 2 with no hope of petitions or boycotts doing *anything.*  He's putting out the movie with her in it, and doesn't seem to care at all even if it makes less money.\n\n**EDIT:** Maybe it wasn't the director.  Maybe it was Safran.  Someone else in the comments linked to [this article](https://deadline.com/2021/07/amber-heard-aquaman-2-johnny-depp-fans-1234802845/) in which Safran (Producer?) says he would never give in to the \"Twitterverse.\"",

He had a habit of walking on the beach before he began his work.\n\nOne day, as he was walking along the shore, he looked down the beach and saw a human figure moving like a dancer. He smiled to himself at the thought of someone who would dance to the day, and so, he walked faster to catch up.\n\nAs he got closer, he noticed that the figure was that of a young man, and that what he was doing was not dancing at all. The young man was reaching down to the shore, picking up small objects, and throwing them into the ocean.\n\nHe came closer still and called out \"Good morning! May I ask what it is that you are doing?\"\n\nThe young man paused, looked up, and replied \"Throwing starfish into the ocean.\"\n\n\"I must ask, then, why are you throwing starfish into the ocean?\" asked the somewhat startled wise man.\n\nTo this, the young man replied, \"The sun is up and the tide is going out. If I don't throw them in, they'll die.\"\n\nUpon hearing this, the wise man commented, \"But, young man, do you not realize that there are miles and miles of beach and there are starfish all along every mile? You can't possibly make a difference!\"\n\nAt this, the young man bent down, picked up yet another starfish, and threw it into the ocean. As it met the water, he said,\n\"It made a difference for that one.\"",

No matter how many women he beats to the point of unconsciousness, no matter how many dogs he kills, he will still be played on the radio, sing on songs with fucking Jay-Z, Drake, and every other top 40 artist of the day, and look shredded on the cover of men\u2019s health. He\u2019s somehow invincible. I think women have felt like this for a long time, seeing Harvey Weinstein portrayed as a pillar of excellence for 3 decades, Cosby, hell look at Steven motherfucking Segal. The dude is a scumbag, women keep coming out and he keeps making studios money. At the end of the day, the studio weighs, \u201cWhat does our return on investment look like, which actor do we bet on giving us a return in the long run.\u201d In the line-up of Amber vs. Johnny, our boy looked like more of a liability and the studios bet on Amber. A middle aged dude with a history of trauma and drug abuse or a young starlet who used her marriage with Johnny to get to the top. And she will continue to work and succeed because she is seen as less of a risk EVEN though she is a sociopathic monster. It\u2019s all about the fucking money.",

Which is being looked into now. He sued the Sun for libel, which the judge said there was clear evidence that she was abusive and they're relationship was unhealthy, but still stuck with the headline of being a wife beater, so the sun won that case. Amber hasn't won anything in court. Although, Depp did lose the libel case.\n\nThere's a lot of people who will never change their mind no matter the evidence that comes out. They'll never spend time either looking at all the evidence either. Amber's lawyers spoke with over 100 people Depp has worked with over the years and no one said anything negative about him. I think cancelling is a waste of energy, she shouldn't be getting jobs because she's mediocre at best. During their divorce, she tried to act like an abused wife but Depp's lawyer's weren't taking it and you can see her getting mad. Those tapes are on youtube. \n\nThere's so much else showing how horrible she was during their marriage like security footage of her bringing home Elon Musk and James Franco while Depp was on tour with his band, and these are dates that she was allegedly beating her. It just keeps going.",

Sometimes (not always) he would do certain defensive maneuvers like stick out his hands to stop her or push her off of him. I know for a fact that is what happened because I watched it play out many, many times. Any time he would do something to stop her she would fall onto something or one time she ran into his hand and broke her nose (she was also taking pills heavily and didn\u2019t have the best balance or coordination) . She would 100% of the time show the entire family her bruises and play the victim. He would also show his bruises, scratches, bite marks etc. She always got the sympathy. They always believed her. When he would complain he was basically told to shut up and quit complaining because she\u2019s tiny and how much damage could she really do. It was disgusting. I never understood why nobody cared about what he was going through. HE had it bad. Growing up like that really hardened me to claims of abuse (which i know shouldn\u2019t be the case) and definitely opened my eyes to the fact that the pretty, tiny little woman could be just as guilty as the big burley man. I tell everyone stories from my childhood to give them a little insight. Hopefully one day everyone will be able to talk about their abuse equally. It\u2019s fucking sad for abused men right now.",

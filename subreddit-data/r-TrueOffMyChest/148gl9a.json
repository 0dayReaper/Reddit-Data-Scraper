    "postText": "PLEASE DONT POST THIS ON TIKTOK. I HAVE FAMILY ON THERE. \n\nReddit I\u2019m in desperate need of advice. \nThis is going to be a long read, as this is 6 years of drama coming to a head. \n\nI began dating my boyfriend when I was 16 going on 17. And he was 18. He was extremely hesitant to even be friends as he believed I was just too young. Over some time he eventually gave it a shot when I asked him to hang out and the rest is history. Initially, my mom was impressed with him. He was good looking, on route to become an electrician, and was kind to her. \n\nOver the first year we always wanted to hang out, which angered my mom as she wanted me to spend time with her more. I\u2019d see him every two days and spend those in-between usually with my family since she wouldn\u2019t let me do anything else. This is where the problems began. \n\nAs time went on she became resentful of my boyfriend, as he no longer was heading to school to become an electrician, and he encouraged me to stand up to my moms controlling and aggressive behaviour. While teaching me how to drive, she would grab me by the hair pulling me from one side of the car to the next. She\u2019d physically and verbally abuse me over something as simple as not coasting long enough before breaking. \n\nMy moms behaviour towards my boyfriend and I changed. She blamed him for my intolerance for her abusive behaviour, immediately taking a dislike to him. One night she had repeatedly insulted him for no longer pursuing being an electrician and calling him a bum, this was 2018 so I was 17. He has sat her down with my father and sternly but politely said how he doesn\u2019t  appreciate her talking to him like that and it\u2019s offensive. This set my mom OFF.\n\nHe was banned from the house for a year, it was tough to see him at all. This strained our relationship severely but eventually a year later my mom came around. She still made simple things hell, arguments for wanting to go on trips. Family arguments involving all of the little family we have. Lying and turning people against me. Etc.\n\nThese events along with many fights and blow outs in between changed the dynamic of my relationship with my boyfriend. Someone who was once kind and understanding became angry and resentful. He hates my mother, and she hates him. And I\u2019m caught in the middle. \n\nFast forward to today. She\u2019s back to saying she never wants to see him and he never wants to see her. They both insult me when they get angry, they both put me in a position to chose between them, and they both tell me it\u2019s because they love me. \n\nI\u2019m torn. \n\nHe never comes around my house which substantially makes it worse but who would want to be around my mother ? \n\nI don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t feel ready to move out and he can\u2019t help me if I did. I\u2019d also be cut off from my family and their support so I\u2019d be wholly on my own. \n\nThanks for reading. I\u2019ll edit any more additional information I think of, I just am so scrambled right now",

You\u2019re probably right about them both being aggressive meaning they aren\u2019t good for me, I just wonder if it\u2019s because of my mom? My father was and always has been a gentle soul, but my mother can bring a beast out of him with how she treats him. I\u2019m torn :( but don\u2019t invalidate yourself because of your age and experience, you have good insight :)",

Neither one of them has any business trying to pull the old \"Either they go or I go\" hat-trick.\n\nI do feel for your boyfriend -- he's had to put up with an astonishing amount of bullshit from your dumpster-fire mother over the years.  If you were to decide to choose him that would be sort-of understandable, but then again, kinda not so much. Not if he's nothing but angry anymore.\n\nAnd if you choose your mother you will need to do so knowing that if she doesn't have this boyfriend to abuse, she'll just start on the next one.  You will never find anyone good enough for her, because she is not about to share you with anyone.  So if you want to spend the rest of your life being very little other than your mother's daughter, and having no life and no identity to call your own, by all means choose her.\n\nSo choose neither.  Choose yourself instead.  If you still live in your family home, it's time to move out and cut the cord.  It's time to set some very hard and very clear boundaries with Mommy Dearest, and if she refuses to respect them, it's time to go VLC or NC with her unless and until she cleans up her act.  And take a break from your boyfriend and give yourself some time to figure out what you want for yourself. If it turns out to be him, great.  If not, also great. But it needs to be *your* choice.",

But tell your mom to back off your not a kid anymore and all she is doing is pushing you away, and neither of them should be asking you to make a decision like that, s neither one of them is innocent just less guilty I guess, but you might have to put your foot down with both of them, a mom would try harder to like the person your with and a boyfriend wouldn't force you to chose him or your family",

            "comment": "You're framing this wrong. It's not choosing between mother vs boyfriend. It's 2 separate issues.\n\nIssue 1: Staying with an abusive parent. \n\nYou shouldn't live with an abusive person. You need to start making a plan to leave your parents house. You need to have a way to leave (job and bank account they have no access to) as well as a hard and fast deadline for leaving. This remains true whether or not you stay with your boyfriend. \n\nIssue 2: Staying in a relationship with someone who insults you.\n\nMy primary question how does he insult you? Is it him doing things like calling you names or saying things like you need to leave and you become offended? If it's the former (which I'm assuming) I'd strongly consider leaving the relationship. It sounds like it stems from a place of frustration at your mother's behavior but that just means he'll lash out at you when someone else does something he dislikes.",

    "postText": "The title might sound suicidal, but believe me I don't want to die. But I just don't want to live anymore either. I feel like nothing is ever going to change and everything is just pointless.\n\nI am severely anxious but I just can't afford therapy or any psychological help. I constantly have to be the mediator in my family. I feel like I have to be the support system for everybody but i get little support in return. My mind constantly makes awful, tragic, dark scenarios which fucks me up even more, like thinking my whole family will not come back when they've just gone for some chore or a road trip.\n\nPeople in this world are unkind and self-centered. Every day when I think no-one would be able to go any lower, someone definitely does. And when I feel upset about it, I just get told that this is how the world works.\n\nI feel like I'm faking everything. My care amf affection for my loved ones, excitement over anything good, sadness over anything bad, I don't know if my emotions are true anymore, and I think this cannot end. I do not want to die, I will never harm myself, but I want all of this to stop.",

I've been in a state of constant depression where nothing feels like it matters and I'm not passionate or interested in anything anymore. It's basically been that way for Mr since the pandemic. I'm just done with everything, nothing feels like fun anymore, everything is just such a chore. I hobestly doubt I'd have the motivating to get out of bed or do anythibg at all if I wasn't taking care of my SO (who's currently dealing with treatable cervical cancer) and helping my mom thru her divorce from my idiot stepdad.",

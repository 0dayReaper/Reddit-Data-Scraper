    "postText": "Hi everyone,\nToday is my birthday and I just turned 23. I was looking forward to my birthday all year, it was going to be my first birthday without exams (because it\u2019s always during exam period) but now I feel so sad and lonely. I\u2019m lonely every year but this year is a bit hard for me.\n\nAt the start of the year I got into a relationship but it ended and just a few days ago I officially cut ties with my ex. He lost feelings for me out of the blue. I know I have to give it some time as it\u2019s only been a few days but it\u2019s been so hard. I do believe cutting ties has been good for me because all I did was cry when I was with him, but honestly I feel even worse now. This was also my first relationship. I feel so unwanted. I\u2019m trying to focus on myself but I don\u2019t know how to. \n\nThat\u2019s all lol thank you for reading.",

You are at a beautiful age! \n\nEven though it is hard to face heartbreak around your  birthday ( been there done that), you should still try and do something for you!  Bake a cake or go and buy your favorite one! Ask a friend out at a nice place and hang out! Make plans for the year! Go outside and enjoy some son. \n\nEven when our heart is acking  we shoud still take some action...anything that brings some amount of joy...and then that day will no longer be about sorrow, but about a new memory! \n\nHappy Birthday beautiful!",

Take the time to mourn this relationship but don't let it shut you off from living. You're not unwanted, just that guy is a jerk. As corny as it sounds a good relationship will always start with you loving yourself.",

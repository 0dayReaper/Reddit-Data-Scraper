    "postText": "I'm in a group of 4 friends. recently things haven't been going well and people have started not liking somone. shes emo and the others are popular. I'm kind of an in-between. I told the emo everything about what they had been saying and how they were going to kick her out like the other one before even realizing what I was doing. I told her about how much they talked about her and stuff but realized that I sounded really bad and made it seem like I wanted them to stop but in reality I honestly did not care. I told the populars that I think we should wait before we drop her because we're always kicking people out and they said ok and we're going to talk about it later. I didn't want the emo to feel sad because she's a nice person and she just gets me. she's the only person who I can relate to so I told her I fixed everything and now everything's back to normal when I know they're gonna kick her out anyway. i don't even know why I said that and she kept on saying thank you and I feel so terrible knowing I gave her so much false hope. I have no one to talk to about this because I'm only friends with that 4. she's going to get kicked out and there's nothing I can do. I feel so bad about myself. the populars think I hate the emo and like them but the emo thinks I hate them and really like her. we hang out in all one group. I'm trying to string back everyone's friendship piece by piece but it's already too much. I just want everyone to be happy. what can I do next?",

This is 100% high school BS and the \"popular\" girls will likely end up going nowhere eventually anyway. I'm going to assume just based on your post that this is all high school level shit. High school seems like the be all and end all while you're in it but it's really not.\n\nYou should cherish friendships with people like the emo girl. Just be open with her and tell her that you did your best but the others obviously conspired behind your back and because of that you're in solidarity with her and just be her friend. Fuck the others. I know that might seem hard but those others aren't likely going to give a shit after high school. Emo girl could be a lifelong friend from what you've said. You need to hold onto that shit and fuck the superficial BS. For all you know 20 years from now you and emo girl still get together, go on girls trips, share your darkest moments and support each other while the others sound extremely superficial.\n\nAlways remember you are worthy, you are loved, you belong and good things will come. Stand up for what's right and don't take any shit. You're stronger than you think and this is all just a blip on the radar of your life that won't matter in the long term. I promise.",

    "postText": "There are times when I (24M) have a self-defeating and self-pity mindset. Obviously these mentalities get you nowhere in life and I'm working to avoid falling into those pitfalls but I know it's not going to be easy. I have ADHD, depression, and anxiety. ADHD went undiagnosed until December 2022 and my ability to do well academically and socially was severely impacted. It is still difficult to manage but I have an amazing support system and a family who loves me so much and is always there for me. I also take medication for all three conditions and never have to worry about not being able to afford it (although the ADHD medication shortage does complicate things a bit). I have so much to be grateful for and the more I take the time to appreciate it, the happier it makes me. I have about a year and a half left before I get my degree and strive on making progress towards my goals every day, even if it just 30 minutes of coding a day. Hopefully this doesn't sound too cloying, I just needed to say this.",

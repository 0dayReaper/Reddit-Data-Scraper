    "postText": "I am really going insane waiting to hear back from the medical examiner to determine whether my father's death was a suicide or not. I already feel bad emailing them originally. When I did they said they may be able to assist me if I provided them with my dad's information, which I did. It'll have been a week tomorrow since I've emailed them. Should I email them again tomorrow and ask if they were able to access his files or not? I feel like I overshared with them or that I've done something wrong but not knowing is killing me. For reference he died in 2005 but there have been a lot of little clues including one big one that he may have killed himself and that my family hid it from me, and that's why I have to know.\n\nIn the meantime I feel a wide range of emotions, everywhere from betrayal by my family and guilt for how things ended before he passed. And waiting on them to email me back is particularly torturous because I simply can't put the situation to rest.",

I was suspicious of foul play and eventually 6 years later, requested the autopsy/toxicology reports and the police report. I even spoke to the detective who handled the case. It took 3 months to receive all reports so please be patient. \n\nDespite the evidence- I\u2019m still not convinced that he took his own life. So I\u2019m just trying to let you know that you may still not have a clear answer. Also- you have to be prepared for the possibility of photos from the autopsy included in the report. Seriously- be prepared. Or ask for them to be withheld. \n\nI hope this helps even though it\u2019s not exactly good news.",

What would happen if you just choose to believe that he loved you and because of some freak coincidence his heart failed on him? The incredible psychological and/or physical pain people are going through before making the choice to end their own lives is too much of a burden to have to be carried by anyone. Try to find easement in the fact that your father has peace now.",

And to be honest it is also entirely likely that his heart just gave out, he wasn't the healthiest guy.\n\nIt's just like, I had a stranger ask me if my dad was the guy who killed himself, which I had never heard tell of before. And then when I told my best friend growing up about this, she said \"I thought you knew.\" Over the years it seemed like my mom was hiding things from me about his death too, like she once told me to tell a family friend \"he died of a heart attack but to call [her] later\". I even found something that resembled a note but my mom insists he just wrote stuff like that when he was drunk. So it's also this feeling that everybody else knows but me that's getting to me.\n\nI do honestly feel a lot of peace surrounding his death and that's actually true. I know he's okay now. But he suffered a lot in his life before he died and it's just so incredibly sad and to me it seems unfair. Whether or not he killed himself will not change what he went through. I just want to know him a little deeper, I guess, that's all.",

    "postText": "TW talk of miscarriage \n\nAlright so I'll preface this by saying this is technically our second child together. I had a 2 year old when we hot together and when we were dating in the very beginning we got pregnant and had a miscarriage. Well we are almost 3 years in and I didn't think I could get pregnant again after not using protection especially after getting my fallopian tube reconstructed almost 2 years ago. Well I was wrong. \n\nMy boyfriend was super excited and we told his family pretty early on. His parents were excited, 2 of his brothers were excited and his sister was pissed off at us because she was trying. She threw a big tantrum when his parents wanted to tell the rest of the family (with our permission) and our relationship with them hasn't really been the same since. \n\nNow on to the baby shower, I found a weekend I thought worked for everyone but turned out to be a terrible weekend. One of his SILs will be throwing a different baby shower and so his brother won't attend ours, one has a wedding he apparently didn't know he was going to (but threw that date out for a different event), one has to \"work\" but has made other excuses as well so I'm pretty sure they are lying, FIL and BIL have an event to do together but FIL rearranged a few hours so he'd make it to the shower. \n\nI feel like I'm not part of this family anymore, they welcomed us with open arms 3 years ago and now it's like they don't want to be around to celebrate their brother having a child, maybe it's because we aren't married but it still hurts. I don't want my daughter to look back at pictures and see that her aunts and uncles didn't care enough to celebrate her with us. At least I've got my SIL (my brother's wife) who is an absolute angel through all of this and has my back.",

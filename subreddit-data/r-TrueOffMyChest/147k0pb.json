    "postText": "I had my first baby back in September. When I got pregnant, I started losing weight. My doctors weren\u2019t concerned until I was 20 weeks along. I gained 9lbs from 20 weeks to 32 weeks when I had my son. I lost 30lbs in the first 3 months after having him. I\u2019m 9 months postpartum and I\u2019m down 4 pants sizes and wear an extra small/small in shirts when I used to wear a large. \n\nMy body looks foreign to me. Like it\u2019s not mine. I have no clothes that fit me. Every time I try something on that was way too small before pregnancy, it\u2019s now too big. I get so frustrated. It\u2019s also warm now where I live and I can\u2019t hide behind sweatshirts and leggings anymore. \n\nI can\u2019t vent to anyone because no one around me understands and I feel like I should just be grateful that I\u2019m skinny now. But I\u2019m not. I don\u2019t like this body.",

I\u2019m breastfeeding so what I AM getting in, I\u2019m giving it all to the baby. I do tend to get bursts of rage when I\u2019m especially hungry. I do drink protein shakes. But I started losing when I was pregnant and ate a ton. I\u2019ve gotten bloodwork done and nothing came back.",

    "postText": "After two years of stalking on every social platform I had (even Pinterest!) And irl, harassment, thousands of texts begging me to come back and forgive and give him another chance, thousand of texts that would call me a whore, a slut, a liar, all kind of insults because the begging didn't work. After two years of being blackmailed with nudes, , threatened with s*icide.\nI am finally free. \nI (f26) wanted to breakup with him (26) a couple of months into dating, he wasn't the one for me, too clingy, too manipulative, too many fights where I'm gaslit and belittled. I was done. He send videos of him getting off to his ex, claiming he did that so she would hate him and move on. That was my cue, I told him we're done. He didn't take it well and I paid for it for the past two years. Then I fucked the guy he hated most just to get at him. \nFor the past 5 months he tried to get me back but I never reciprocated, never talked to him, never shown a sign I was reading what he was sending me. Until two days ago here he admitted that he wanted me back to fuck me up and ghost me after because of what I did (sleeping with the guy) he said it wasn't worth it anymore and he's done with me. \nI had a mix of emotions, but mostly relief. Glad it was over and I'll be free. But I can't help but think of this is another calm before the storm, is he really going to stop or is this another way to get me to talk to him make me angry and get a reaction.",

    "postText": "I think I talked about this on another subreddit but I don't remember: I came down to eat something while I found that my mum was pretty down about something. After I ate I asked what was wrong, my mum has always been on my side. I love her, I've been telling her everything that was wrong with me.\n\nAnyways, she was silent at first then started to tell me about something very bad she did after I asked what was wrong. And then it became clear to me: my mum was cheating on my dad.\n\nShe's been chatting with various guys since... I can remember. I oveard her flirting with a guy and was sending him nudes and whatever. I heard a voice message of that guy saying things like \"You have such big tits, I want to put my cock between them.\" I was even younger back then but I brushed it off as something they agreed on in their rules of a relationship. \n\nWhen me and my sister were coming home from school she always hung up on a mysterious man.\n\nSo after a little bit of silence I said \"It's about the guys you're talking with isn't it.\" My mum broke down into tears saying things like \"Please don't hate me...\" My dad would find out since she met up with him at McDonald's and received a ticket for parking illegally. I was devastated. I went upstairs and cried. I was torn. I can't hate her, but she messed up real' bad. \n\nSo I've turned to reddit. After everyone comforting me and giving me advice like \"You should support your dad but stay on good terms with your mum.\" Nothing happened since then... was what I thougt. Oddly enough she started to lock herself up in her room from time to time when suddenly a heated argument embarged in one afternoon. My dad was yelling... let me rephrase that: they were yelling at each other etc... I just locked myself in my room and listened to my favorite kpop songs.\n\nAfter I thought my mum or dad would tell me they were getting a divorce... wrong. My mum got a new haircut and who did she tell first? Mr McDonald's. I then pieced together she talked to 2 different guys. One her age, and one younger one. Presumably in his 20s \n\nNext is yesterday. I heard her talk to  the younger guy who went \"Have fun at work.\" I also know from another telephone call that she talked about her husband with the old guy which also means he isn't innocent. \n\nAnd now... in one morning, I was playing persona 5 when the old guy went \"yeah we can flirt-\" when she turned off her phone when she silently walked up the stairs again. I knew excacly what she was doing but... I let her be.\n\nI' facing a dilemma here: either we basically live a lie or I confess I know everything, destroy our family, turn the life of myself, my sister and my dad upside down. I know I'm too young to decide this. And yes, turning to reddit isn't the smartest thing either. But what do you think I should do? I could eavesdrop even more and then expose the guys as well but that's a very dangerous thing since the way I got access to reddit was sneaky enough already.",

You shouldn't feel guilt or responsibility for an adult's actions. People can end romantic relationships without cheating, and she's choosing to do this. \n\nYour parent's relationship and inner workings are only known to them. Let that be their issue, and please don't make it yours despite what your mom says.\n\nYou don't have to hate your mom, but you can have every kind of issue you want with her actions. As a parent, I'm seriously side eyeing her.\n\nI don't know if there's an alternative to flat out telling your dad, like if he stumbles across it himself? Is there another trusted adult in your life to talk to?",

The full blown argument with them yelling at each other was about excacly that. \n\nThe thing is that nothing happened. They seem like they're continuing everything like normal. My dad being in the belief I know nothing about it.\n\nAnd the thing is... I have close to no contact with other members of my family or other adults. That's the reason I turned to reddit in the first place. I can't make friends if mine do that decision for me. \n\nIf I confess to my dad that I know everything, he's probably gonna consider a divorce which... well... wouldn't be good for my sister either. She's traumatized from a teacher in elementary school (she's 11) who treated her like trash. She's mentally unstable and if that would happen the whole picture of our family would crumble. We'd also might have to move away when she just found a friend. \n\nMy sister knows nothing about this and neither of my parents consider telling her, nor do I. \n\nAlso... my mum basically looped me into it by taking me for an idiot or deaf person not hearing her half screaming on her phone. My mum is the person I talked to about... well... everything. I just lived in denial but the weight I carry now is exhausting.",

Even more so if your dad is aware.\n\nYour dad is an adult who is choosing to stay in this relationship. You can only GUESS his motivations. You're taking on ALL this responsibility as if your parents are two inept children. They very well may be, but that's not for you to solve. You don't know if he knows you're aware and is playing it off,  or if you being aware changes a thing for him. People stay together for many reasons, such as financial ones, and they may be doing that. \n\nI think it's sweet for you to care so much for your sister and want stability for her life. Yours counts, too, you know.  You said it yourself that this situation is exhausting,  and that's because it's not your burden to bear. \n\nYour world was turned upside down with this. Not just your dad's, and not just potentially your sister's. Is seeing a therapist an option to help you work through this?  I'm not saying you shouldn't care or pretend like it's all ok because it's going to hurt you in the long run. You've had some really crappy adult problems flung at you. I",

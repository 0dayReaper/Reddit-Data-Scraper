    "postText": "\nI\u2019m 19 and I didn\u2019t plan on going to college but after thinking about it I really wanna go. I\u2019m hoping to start this semester but if not I might have to wait till next year\n\nI don\u2019t have anything saved up for college and the next semester starts in 2 months. The college I wanna go to is about 10 minutes away from my house so I can continue to live with my parents while I go there. But to actually get into college and pay it off would it be doable? My moms gonna help me look into it within the next few weeks",

            "comment": "Depends on the school. If it is a community college you\u2019ll likely have an easier time getting started. A 4 year college will usually be more complicated/restrictive to enroll in classes. \n\nThe financial aid you will receive depends on your parents financial info on the FAFSA, but community college is typically very affordable or free depending on which state you live in if you are in the US. \n\nIt\u2019s definitely very possible for you to go to college though :) \n\nSource: I work in higher ed.",

The best thing you could do before going to the campus would probably be to set up an appointment with an advisor so they can give counsel based on your specific goals and the resources available to you.",

            "comment": "Listen, there's a million ways to do college on the cheap. Many states will pay for 9 credit hours a semester (that's 3/4's of full time) as a side benefit for working in a job with the state. Some companies do this too. Our local grocery store will pay 12 credit hours a semester for its part time employees who work 28 hours a week or more... You can also apply for grants like a Pell Grant and other grants....that all starts with a FAFSA (federal application for financial Aide).....  It's never to late to start to better yourself. I didn't start college until I was 26.... I completed two associate degrees, my bachelors and my doctorate by the time I was 32",

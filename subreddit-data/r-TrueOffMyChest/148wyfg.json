    "postText": "This is embarrassing so I\u2019m using a throwaway. Some of this might be triggering, so warning in advance.\n\nI used to be bullied a lot for my looks. I got asked out as a joke multiple times, never got asked to any dance. I was (and still am) also shy and awkward, which doesn\u2019t help. I had zero experience dating and no one ever taught me about it. When I went to college, I purposefully picked a city across the country so I could reinvent myself. \n\nI saw some other girls using Tinder, so I figured I\u2019d give it a try. I went on my first date ever in a park. He suggested we go back to his place and watch a movie. I, 18 with zero experience, thought that when a guy wants to \u201cwatch a movie\u201d, he literally wants to watch a movie. So I went. He got on top of me, started taking off my clothes and asked if I wanted to have sex. I didn\u2019t really, but I was afraid of upsetting him, so I said I didn\u2019t know. He asked again, and I just froze and said nothing. He did it anyway. He made me do a lot of degrading things I didn\u2019t enjoy. I felt disgusting afterwards.\n\nI kept trying to get over him. I didn\u2019t really want the sex, I was just insecure and wanted validation that I was attractive after being told I was ugly my whole life. So I would match with guys and go back to their place. I would take off my clothes for them, just to see their reaction to my body. Then I\u2019d tell them I didn\u2019t want to go any further, but some of them didn\u2019t take no for an answer.\n\nWhen I tried to stop doing that and just date \u201cnormally\u201d I never got anywhere. Pretty much every guy would ghost me if I turned down sex. I saw all the other girls who got flowers, cute dates, and I never got that. I had only conservative pictures on my dating profile. I never went after the \u201chot\u201d guys, but rather ones who were shorter, chubby, balding, whatever. Nothing made a difference. \n\nI met one guy who I thought was special. We went on six dates before having sex. He was the first person who took an actual interest in me. He would always make time to see me and plan fun dates for us. And he, too, ghosted me after almost a year. \n\nI tried to figure out why I was being treated this way. I posted both my face and nude body with my face cropped out numerous times to every rating subreddit possible. I got some negative comments, but mainly positive ones. If I were actually as attractive as these people think, why was I being treated like trash?\n\nI\u2019m currently 23. I haven\u2019t had sex in 3 years, since that guy ghosted me. I\u2019ve still never had a real relationship. I finally realized that what I was doing was only harming me, but I often get daily flashbacks from these experiences. \n\nI think of the guy who shoved a pillow over my face and kept going when I told him to stop. I think of the one who wanted to do it with the lights off, then didn\u2019t give me $3 for a bus ride home after. I frequently look some of the men up on social media and obsess over them, even though they made me feel this way. I feel ashamed of myself. I plan on getting plastic surgery, so that I can be truly beautiful and finally experience being loved and valued.",

Which hurts my soul. Giving up my power has become a net negative to my mental health. I walked down a path that causes me to be bullied and it hurts my heart. Unsure of what to do I don\u2019t feel like any of my relationships in the future will be healthy. I\u2019ve been unable to feel comfortable now when talking to any women. Have I dug a hole I can\u2019t get out of?",

            "comment": "I'm sorry about the past you've experienced. My advice from the bottom of my heart is to continue your break from romance for a bit. There is no problem with you, however a big part of the reason you keep finding people who abuse you, is because you keep looking for them subconsciously.\nI know nothing about dating, so I'll try and do my best. Constantly finding people who put us down is a sign that we do not like our own selves and believe that's what we deserve. \nI am not going to say you shouldn't get plastic surgery, but superficially changing won't change the fact that you gravitate towards abusive people. I'm so sorry that this has happened to you, but please know that you have the power to arrest this cycle. It will take a long while, but you need to know that there's so much better for you, whether you're single or with anyone.\nI highly recommend seeing a therapist, but if you can't afford that, books and online resources are your friend.\nHere are some:\n\nThe Crappy childhood fairy (on YouTube, Spotify)\n\nThe inner child podcast (Spotify)\n\nIf you're not ready to take a really deep dive, you can start by chipping away at things by talking to a hotline just to get your thoughts moving - https://www.rainn.org/get-help\nRAINN helped me alot.\n\nPodcasts have been a wonderful resource for my own recovery. I've watched a good share of TEDx talks too.\nIdentifying yourself with other people who have suffered the same trauma can be the first step, so you know you're not alone and so that you can see other people's recoveries.\n\nTake it from someone who's been there, your trauma will not resolve if you ignore it by dressing yourself up. For me, it was developing an eating disorder. Didn't change a single thing for me and I still felt like trash.\nI'm doing better now, slowly chiselling at the wall of pain. I am confident you can too. Just remember that people here, in the comments, in life, we believe in you.\nI'm so sorry this has happened to you, it was not your fault.",

    "postText": "\n\n\nI have been having suspecions for almost 4 months since I hired this (17 year old) babysitter for my 3 year old daughter. I'm a nurse working full time while he works three nights a week and comes home to sleep during the day.\n\n\nI felt I was going crazy because something was off and he refused to ease my mind and answer questions I had - so I put a camera in the living room and saw nothing til day 4 where he and the babysitter were making out on the couch behind my daughter's back while she was watching tv. I felt like my entire world came crashing to the ground. I felt all kinds of negative feelings including guilt even though I just wanted to keep my job when he complained about me pushing him to the side.\n\n\nHe started crying when confronted, tried to get me to listen but I took my daughter and went to stay with mom. It's been a whole month now. The babysitter is gone and he's still crying about his slip up, even went as far as say the babysitter was the one initiating. I feel like I'm done with him after this. He managed to make me feel guilty for not dressing up or giving him enough attention now I do strongly believe I bear part of the blame in what happened. I feel disguested and my mind and heart keep racing not knowing how to deal with all of this. he's begging for a second chance and his family are defending him against me.\n\nI forgot to mention our ages: I'm 31 and he's 34.",

I was just working extra shifts while dealing with loss of multiple co workers and friends.

If you\u2019re not sleeping well visit the doctor for sleep aids. I\u2019m really sorry this has happened to you and wish you the best.",

It's much easier to keep it together when no one is pushing you. \n\nEven kissing a minor isn't the strangest thing about this, although it's obviously still a pretty bad thing to do. The weirdest part is how the husband seemingly didn't try very hard to fix things with his wife. It's alright to feel like your needs aren't being met. This is something you should discuss with your wife. And not with a babysitter... And not in that way... And especially not when they're a fucking minor.",

I still remember being pissed and I was only 13/14 because even back then, 9-10 years ago, I knew that he wasn\u2019t feeling guilty for doing it. He was guilty for getting caught and thinking my sister wouldn\u2019t say anything. Just like your husband is. He\u2019s feeling guilty for getting caught taking advantage of this 17 year old child. Because she is a child. I would leave and report him. Because when your daughter is that age, anywhere from 15-18, is he going to be looking at her with disgusting lustful look too? Probably. A 34 year old man shouldn\u2019t be interested in a child, especially when he has a child of his own. He will do this again. Do not trust a man that blames the child when he\u2019s the adult and knew better.",

He cried when he got caught. I decided to give him a second chance &amp; we started counseling, but I could never trust him again. He cheated several more times, with different women. When I caught him cheating again, he said it was my fault- I didn\u2019t give him enough sex, I didn\u2019t wear nice clothes, I didn\u2019t wear enough makeup, blah blah blah. He thought cheating was my fault. Looking back, it was hell from the first time I caught him until I filed for divorce, which was a year or two. Years of emotional abuse left me broken with no confidence. But my point is that he cheated many times after I forgave him &amp; we were supposedly trying to work things out. OP, this is an awful time for you, but you are a strong woman, have a career, &amp; a beautiful child. Rip the bandage off &amp; leave him. Thinking of you.",

He cheated on her while she was pregnant and blamed her. Everyone blamed her (??) and she accepted that it was her fault cuz she couldn\u2019t fulfill his needs (??). \nShe forgave the bastard and they stayed together. He promised the mistake would never happen again. Spoiler alert, it did happen again. And again. And again. Every time it was somehow her fault tho it clearly wasn\u2019t. And every time she forgave him and stayed with him \u201cfor our daughter\u201d. \nFast forward to present day, I\u2019m in a legal battle with them because he tried to SA my sister (16) while she was at their house. MULTIPLE TIMES. He talked her into believing she was at fault and if she would tell anyone it would be her fault that his family would break up etc etc. \nAnyway. In all of this it turned out that my sister was not the only minor he had attempted to and had SA\u2019d. His little daughter, precious little angel, only 7 now, got hurt because her mother stayed \u201cfor my daughter\u201d. \n\nMy point is. Please please don\u2019t stay with him \u201cfor your child\u201d because I can promise you you don\u2019t want to be in my shoes right now. And if you take that POS back you\u2019re taking the risk of your child being harmed. \nThis isn\u2019t a one time mistake. He\u2019s just sorry he got caught. And he\u2019s showed you that not only is he a pedo but he also will absolutely try to pin All the blame on the minor he took advantage of. That\u2019s a terrifying person. \n\nPlease just don\u2019t make any rushed decisions and please remember, it\u2019s better for a child to have an absent parent than to have a toxic parent in their life.\n\n\nEdited to add. My sister and his daughter were only 2 of MANY of his victims. When I stepped up and pressed charges (helping my sister) it came out that there were many others, most under 16 even. 16 seemed to be one of the oldest ages he\u2019d even go after.",

Your husband was in a position of power, AND he preyed upon a very young and impressionable girl. It's wrong all the way around. People who blame their partners for their own indiscretions are so gross. Cheating is never the other person's fault. Cheating happens because there's something broken within the cheater that needs addressed. But it is in no way your fault. It also shows he's likely to not take responsibility in the future and will do it again. No remorse and blaming others for his own actions is a huge red flag that should not be overlooked.

All of this is true even if she was already sexually active, because he is double her age and was supposedly a safe adult in her life.

Like okay, 17 is a little old to really call it pedophilia, but in terms of his mindset... He's in a power position over a minor, her paycheck literally depends on him being pleased with her and her work, and yet he wants to blame it on her. That's the exact same situation as a CEO implying that if his secretary doesn't have sex with him she's fired. Same exact thing. He never has to say that out loud for it to be true, either.\n\nYour husband being an emotionally fucked up gaslighting predator is not your fault. Whatever you did or did not do for him in the bedroom is also not the culprit. Adults are responsible for their own actions. The more he tries to pass off the blame the more he shows his own immaturity. I hope you and your little one are OK and I'm sure that as long as you stand your ground, take him to court for the divorce, and just keep telling the truth, that the two of you (you and your baby) will be fine.",

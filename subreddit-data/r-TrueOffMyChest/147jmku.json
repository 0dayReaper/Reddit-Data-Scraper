Yet every city in Tennessee is building townhouses left and right as if there is a housing shortages. \n\nseems like everyone is struggling while these big corporations are having record profits, it just doesn't add up for me.",

It would also set a horrible example for the kids and possibly put them in danger because you never know if he is suddenly one day just gonna lose all the money yall have.\n\nmy BIL is a gambling addict (though he'd never admit it) and him and his gf are constantly struggling and, even when they get/make large amounts of money, they lose it qlmost immediately because he is gambling. (that or starting some \"new buisness\" that he insists will make him rich and then gives up on a week later lol)\n\nbut, yes, gambling and losing hundreds of thousands is definitelyy a red flag\n\nit is really all about what makes you happy and what you think you can live with forever. personally, I couldn't live like that, never knowing if we will lose everything one day because he decided to go gamble it all away. for me, that's no way to live. especially since I already have severe anxiety, that would just make it so much worse.",

If this guy is somehow smart enough to secure a bag that large at work, only to be that far in debt, then it's an issue.  On the other hand, I've known a few folks who make that much, and that sort of debt probably doesn't \"ping\" as a world ending problem for him, since to his mind, he's probably thinking \"I could stop cold turkey, and have this paid off in a few, maybe several months if I REALLY really had to\".  People making that much money tend to see it in very different ways than the rest of us.\n\nThe issue here is the behavior.  $200k isn't exactly world ending to someone who will make $1.2 million dollars in a couple years of work, but then that means that the guy absolutely CANNOT lose his job, because if he does, then $200k will uuuuuhhhhmediately become a world-ending issue, and if you two are together, he could take you down with him.\n\nMan, tough call.",

This is the answer! \n\nAction is the cure for worry.\n\nYou CAN make a budget and decide for yourself that you will be the master of your own money, regardless of how much you make.\n\nCan you sell your car and take public transportation, instead? Rent a car once every two weeks to stock up on groceries or to just go for a nice drive. \n\nCan you change your eating habits? Shop for fresh ingredients. Make a meal plan and cook more at home. I think you'd really be surprised how much money you can save in groceries.\n\nFind free things to do for entertainment around your town or city. Have a movie night at home. Make your own popcorn with melted butter. Yum!\n\nThe key to success in this venture is your attitude. You are in control of your money, and you decide how to spend it. The point of a budget is to do more with less. How else can you save money? What other fun things or hobbies can you enjoy without breaking the bank?\n\nIf you ask yourself these questions, instead, I promise, you'll be sleeping like a baby.",

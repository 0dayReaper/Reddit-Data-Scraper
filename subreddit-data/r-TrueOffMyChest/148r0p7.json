    "postText": "My(21f) bf(24m) of almost 3 years and I are both regularly active on the social media (snap, fb, insta, tiktok). However, within the next few years, I want to be social media free (probably all except tiktok). I feel social media brings so many mental health issues and it really does add to the normal everyday stress by just being an option. A few times over the years, I have deleted all apps weeks at a time just to relax and it helped so much but how do I introduce this idea to someone that possibly doesn't feel the same? If he doesn't agree, I have absolutely no issue with him keeping whatever apps he wants. This has nothing to do with trust because if he wanted to cheat, he could easily find other ways. I just think ridding of social media could possibly be great for any relationship. Everything should be tried at least once imo. \n\nWhat are yalls thoughts?\n\nTdlr, what are yalls thoughts on social media in a relationship? How do you introduce deleting it for the both of yall?",

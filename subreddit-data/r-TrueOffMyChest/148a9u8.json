    "postText": "I struggle with food and I tend to wear long sleeves and baggy clothes even in 100+ heat.  The comments I get going out anywhere less dressed feel mean and unnecessary.  Sometimes I'm very bad at eating and grabbing at my wrists or telling me to eat something can be so discouraging.  Teasing me over it feels awful.\n\nI just wish I was seen as a human and not a spectacle.  I try everyday to be smart to myself but my body doesnt work like a lot of others does.  It hurts my feelings especially when I'm trying to gain weight.  It makes it feel hopeless.\n\nSorry to whine, lately has been tough and the comments hurt a lot.",

It\u2019s weird, and it\u2019s really rude. Don\u2019t be afraid to tell people that you don\u2019t want to hear comments about your body, or how much you\u2019re eating. It\u2019s none of their business.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m sorry people are making those comments, it\u2019s really does suck ass. I\u2019ve always struggled with weight gain and hearing people say I\u2019m \u201clucky\u201d or I \u201cshould be grateful\u201d for being skinny really invalidates my feelings. I can eat 5 big meals a day or 1 meal the next. Those 5 don\u2019t do anything but if I have a day where I eat once I lose like 5 lbs. \n\nLately I\u2019ve been feeling better about it tho, an old friend once told me that we only have the one body that takes us through life. We spend so much time criticizing it until we don\u2019t have it anymore. We can\u2019t be so harsh on ourselves especially if it\u2019s something we can\u2019t change. I\u2019ve been 93lbs all the way up to 140 when I was pregnant and I wouldn\u2019t change what I look like now for anything.\n\nIt\u2019s easier said than done, but don\u2019t take those comments or actions to heart. People like that usually turn out to be emotionally immature on some level and they don\u2019t have the ability to empathize with others. This only means that they will always find SOMETHING to comment on. You can\u2019t please these people and if you try you will only end up hurting yourself because you\u2019ll never be good enough in their eyes no matter what. It\u2019s actually nice to realize that because it only means there\u2019s nothing wrong with you AT ALL! It takes practice, but you can become a master at letting go of those hurtful things because your love for yourself overpowers anything and everything negative anyone says, thinks, or does. \n\nI hope you find what you\u2019re looking for in yourself because you are already beautiful. Those ugly comments aren\u2019t a reflection of yourself, it\u2019s a reflection on the people who say them. I can only imagine the internal turmoil they go through to be able to put someone else down so easily.",

A lot of people don\u2019t realize how abrasive their behavior is until someone calls them out. If these people are close to you, than you owe it to everyone involved to set some boundaries.",

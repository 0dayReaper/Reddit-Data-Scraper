    "postText": "I (22f) broke up with my high school sweet heart first love, all that shit , ex bf (21m) and my dad is being an absolute AH about it.\n\nOk so I did long distance with my boyfriend through college and we recently had moved back to our home town. Long distance was pretty terrible for me and I always held out that it would all be ok once we were in person, but the past few months made it clear to me that ex bf and I are very different in what we want our futures to look like. So yah we broke up a few days ago. \n\nI immediately told my mom and my brothers the next day. I told them all not to tell my dad. Well today he asked something about my ex bf and I said idk I broke up with him. He immediately starts telling me this is a mistake - just a few memorable quotes \u201che was supposed to be your husband and he was the perfect boyfriend\u201d \u201cyou need to fix this, this is such a big mistake\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like all the girls that always think there\u2019s someone better\u201d\n\nYah after that last one, I just kinda blacked out what he was saying and went up to my room (I\u2019ve been living at home since graduating). My dad and I have never gotten along the best, definitely due to my parents relationship. Since I\u2019ve been home  we\u2019ve been getting along so well and now I know he\u2019ll be bringing this up, honestly for years to come. \n\nIt took so much for me finally work up the courage to end things with my bf and it felt like a weight off my shoulders - obviously still sucks but I\u2019m doing pretty ok. Now I\u2019m just crushed that my dad can\u2019t even support one of the hard decisions I\u2019ve had to make.",

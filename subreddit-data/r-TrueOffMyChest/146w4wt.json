    "postText": "So a little back story I 33f and my brother(B) 36m were very close when we were little until my parents got divorced when I was 5 and he was 7. My mom(M) remarried my stepdad(SD) when I was almost 7 and B was 9. After that B was very mean to me and because of the divorce and craziness of CPS and going to court for years over money and drama with our parents I developed an eating disorder in which food became my comfort. I\u2019ve been over weight since I was 7. I\u2019m still over weight as an adult.  B was always bullying me and getting his friends to join. He has said many mean and hurtful things to me over my life. \nExample of one of the worst: when I was 14 and B was 16 he got mad at me for a small thing and told me if he ever had a kid like me he\u2019d kill himself then he thought about it for a second while I was bawling and he told me actually I\u2019d kill the kid. My life is worth more than that. \nI have very few good memories with him and they are all when I\u2019m really little. We have never been close and it\u2019s always him calling me names and making snide remarks. \n\nB was always the golden child and was treated as such. He was smarter and better looking and soon I was put down by basically everyone in my family about my weight and compared to B in  every way. From about ages 16-22 I contemplated ending my life many times. I got close a few times but never did. \n\nB went to college when I was in grade 10 and the state that I live in my dad(D) found out that if your parents are divorced you can sue them for college money. So my dad decided to sue my mom and back to court we went. B was given 34% from D and 33% from M and he was responsible for 33%. He went away to school at a 4 year university in a major US city in our state and I was told I had to go to a community college where D would pay for classes and M would give me gas money. D paid for some but M never gave me gas. I felt like I don\u2019t matter to anyone and was an afterthought so I barely tried and ended up getting my associates. After university B did 4 years pre med with M and D supporting him and he became a specialty doctor. I also got my CNA and tired to work full time and go to school to get my RN. Ended up not getting my RN. I struggled for a long time got engaged, had a child (C) 9f became a single mom and struggled for a long time. I am now in a fantastic place in my life, I bought a house, have a fantastic job, C is flourishing and is the best little girl. She\u2019s kind and the sweetest thing. I am also dating an amazing man. \n\nOk on to today I\u2019m in NYC at my brothers second wedding to a younger specialty doctor (W) who he met while dating the girl he cheated on his first wife with. I almost didn\u2019t come because of our relationship. I have absolutely no good memories of him and all of them he is either being an asshole, ignoring me or putting me down about my weight or asking snidely about my money situation. At the rehearsal dinner and the wedding the bride\u2019s family were saying all theses amazing things about him. About how kind, caring, loving and sweet he is to them and W. How he\u2019s hilarious and a great doctor and I was heartbroken that I\u2019d never seen that side. All I\u2019ve ever seen from him was ugliness, ill intent and hatred towards me. I was ok until after the wedding when he and his new W walked around our family table when he went out of his way to ignore when he walked past me twice to speak to everyone else at the table then dragged his W away before she could speak to me. I was even more hurt. \n\nMy aunt could see I was upset and took me outside and we talked. I came back in and everyone was trying to comfort me and all I wanted to be was left alone. I was hurt and they were making it worse. He isn\u2019t close to anyone of us anymore but expects us to do things for him. I was sitting facing the wall and I ended up crying a little bit because my family wouldn\u2019t leave it alone. Well at some point my mom had said something to my brother and he comes into over and puts his hand on my shoulder and said not saying hi to you wasn\u2019t intentional and was being sarcastic and mean to me. I told him to go enjoy his wedding. He kept pushing and wouldn\u2019t leave me alone and I quietly snapped. Trust me I wanted to make a speech but I said to him and W that I\u2019m happy that his friends, colleagues and W\u2019s family love him so much and think he\u2019s a great amazing person but I don\u2019t have one good memory with him. He\u2019s never been nice or kind or there for me like all these people say he has been to them. Then I turned to his new W and told her I love her and hope he never treats her like he\u2019s treated me. He told me I was making the wedding about my self and I told them to leave me alone. I was planning on sitting there quietly and not saying a word just enjoying my family. M just had to say something to him and I couldn\u2019t hold back. I ended up going outside for a while and calmed down then came back and enjoyed myself. I am going to spend the rest of my vacation just enjoying the rest of my family.",

Your brother sounds like a real pill.\n\nI\u2019m sorry both for the trauma of your childhood and for what an asshole your brother still is today.\n\nIt sounds like even though you both faced hardships, you chose to grow and come out of them as a healthy person or at least someone aiming to be emotionally honest, kind, and generous to others. On the other hand, your brother chose, over and over from a young age, to be vindictive, cruel, self-centred, and a bully.\n\nIf I were in your shoes I would be grappling a bit with whether or not your brother was someone I wanted to keep in my life. This is a well established pattern of his by now\u2014I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to change at some point and become a kinder, more loving brother. Or that you\u2019ll ever get an apology for his cruelty.\n\nI\u2019m not here to tell you what to do\u2014but I do think it sounds like his new wife\u2019s family has seen a highly curated (and likely fake) side of him.\n\nThe man you\u2019ve experienced (mean, bullying, arrogant, etc) and the guy who cheated on his wife\u2014that\u2019s the guy your brother is at his core.\n\nWhere the rest of your family seems\u2026 emotionally messy, (as are many families!) your brother seems actively malicious.\n\nYou deserve to feel secure in your relationships, OP.\n\nI\u2019m so happy to hear you\u2019ve got a great person you\u2019re dating now and that you and your daughter are thriving! You deserve to thrive!",

Some kids are little shits growing up and change and become better. Others are good and become monsters. Others still were awful and remain awful. \n\nThere's also the reversion theory, when you're around family or people whom you haven't seen for a long time, that subconsciously you begin acting how you were towards that person. He ignored you, you reverted into yourself, and someone got involved blowing it up beyond what it needed to be. Has this happened before? \n\nIt was his wedding. You took the focus away from him. He doesn't understand his behavior because he doesn't care to understand. You said it yourself- you knew who he was, and when he acted as you expected you got upset. \n\nI'm sorry, but some people are incapable of change. Your family sounds like it's dysfunctional and I am sorry, but sometimes people are like a tumor- you can either cut them out surgically or let them drag you down until you die. \n\nMaybe it's time to cut bait and let it go. It sounds like you have made a better life for yourself without your brother, and maybe your life will be better without ever having your brother there. He sounds undeserving of what I at least perceive to be some deep seeded need to feel some sort of validation from him. You're not going to get it, and frankly you don't need it. The only validation a person truly needs in life is their own. \n\nLet him self destruct and get a third or fourth wife. You live your best life not to spite him but for yourself. Because at the end of it self worth is the only that that actually matters in life.",

You all may be blood related but he isn\u2019t someone you would consider a family, to be honest no one in your \u201cfamily\u201d deserve to be called family.\n\nFamily is a title that should be earned not just given because they are blood related to you. Basically you are more upset that this prick who has been nothing but mean to you has found that family, but they don\u2019t know who he really is. \n\nLook, who knows why he hates you. More then likely it\u2019s either he\u2019s jealous of you or because your narcissistic parents love making the golden child to also abuse the scapegoat and so he probably doesn\u2019t even know why he hates you and does it as that\u2019s what he\u2019s been conditioned to do by your hateful parents. Also possible that he actually hates your mom but is taking it out on you, what makes me say that is cause he started when your mom got someone else. \n\nHonestly either you need to have a serious talk with him as adults or you need to cut those people out of your life and realize that as a kid you had no choice but to sit there and take the abuse and criticism, so that was actual abuse that you were a victim to and you survived. \n\nNow you are an adult, that means YOU can choose to keep allowing them to abuse and treat you with disrespect or you can decide that your happiness and peace will not continue to be shit on by hateful people who are blood related to you. Sweet soul, you are no longer a victim, now you are volunteering to be treated this way. \n\nYOU do not have to keep allowing this abuse and disrespect, you can\u2019t make it stop by being around them, you can make it stop by cutting them out of your life and YOUR families life. Be an example for your daughter about knowing your worth and not allowing people to treat you like shit any longer. \n\nHe basically is nothing and no one to you, he showed you when he disrespected you by PURPOSELY ignoring you and dragging his new wife past you. He\u2019s a narcissist and he is more then likely going to abuse her or already is, narcissist keep people who are easily controlled. \n\nYou should have a meeting with him and his new wife and try to get closure, you should do it only when they are together, don\u2019t let him meet you without her, just tell him you would like to have a dinner with them to apologize for your behavior. \n\nThen when they meet you (you should bring your person with you for support) ask him why he thinks it\u2019s okay to continue to treat you this way.\nAsk him why it is he thinks he hates you. Tell him that you didn\u2019t make it about you at his wedding but it became about you because of his ignorant actions. \n\nLet him know that the way your parents raised you both doesn\u2019t have to continue and he can choose to be an actual decent person and stop abusing you already because you all are grown and can choose to be the people you want to be. Let him know that if he wants you and your family, a part of his and his new brides life then he needs to learn to treat you like an actual human being with feelings and be a better person to you.\n\nLet him know that no one causes him to act the way he does, that because he\u2019s now an adult he\u2019s actively choosing to be an asshole to you for no reason. Let him know how hurt it is that he can choose to be a better and good person to strangers but not to his own baby sister who he abused with the adults in your lives. \n\nMake sure that his bride hears it all so she can really see who she chose to marry. If he\u2019s an actual narcissist and not just a product of being a golden child then he will listen and maybe it may change but if he\u2019s an actual narcissist, he more then likely won\u2019t hear you, most likely won\u2019t let you talk, and gaslight you like he did at his wedding. \n\nIf you rather just cut him out your life then confront him, then do that. You can choose to warn him, like send him a text stating that, you don\u2019t know why he invited you if he really didn\u2019t want you there he could have just not sent an invite, doing so then ignoring you and making his new wife do it as well was just ignorant and sad, it basically told you he only invited you so he didn\u2019t look like an asshole to his new wife and family, and you won\u2019t sit here and play his sick narcissist games. Tell him you are done being abused by him and that if he ever decides to take his head out his ass and be an adult and tell you why he hates you so much then you want nothing to do with him, then go no contact. \n\nOr you can just ghost him and never speak or interact with him again. He is not your family, most of the people who you call family sounds like they aren\u2019t. You need to learn YOU can pick and choose who gets the title of family. You can\u2019t pick who you are blood related to but you can pick who you keep in your life and call family, and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want someone who seems to hate you around your child, right?",

I no longer put myself, my feelings, last.  I no longer apologized for things that were not my doing or my fault.  I dumped friends of over 50 years that didn\u2019t support me in this.  They liked that however shitty they were to me, I would always be the first to call and apologize and take the blame for their behavior, and forgive what they said.  I left my church of 50 years, my marriage of 40 years.  I\u2019m now the happiest I\u2019ve ever been.  I like me.  My kids like me.  My grandkids like me.

He was upset at you for disrupting that image of him in front of other people.\n\nHe cheated on one wife already and left the mistress for a younger woman. One day in private, probably in the near future because he married this woman and \u201clocked her down\u201d his mask will slip and he will be the PoS you remember to his new wife in private.

I wouldn\u2019t hold too much weight on what the in-laws said. Their daughter just married a doctor, that\u2019s probably all they care about. And I am sure the limited time he spent with them he put his best face forward. It\u2019s not sustainable. \n\nIf you have a chance, join the subreddit or google emotional neglect. Unless you aren\u2019t at the point where you want to explore your childhood pain. But it helped a lot with my healing process and understanding why I am the way that I am. I had similar older golden child experience. It\u2019s very hurtful and can kill your self worth. \n\nHugs. I am sorry you experienced this. But I agree with going no contact with him. He\u2019s not a nice person and doesn\u2019t bring any positivity into your life. You can make all the excuses for how he behaved as a child. But he isn\u2019t one anymore. He\u2019s near 40. Now it\u2019s not from anger of a divorce or not knowing better\u2026 he\u2019s just an asshole.",

He had no way of processing what really happened because he was so young, and sees you as the cause of his heartache. \n\nIt also sounds as though he is not a person who internally diagnoses his feelings or why they exist. Some people don\u2019t care and that\u2019s that. It\u2019s unfortunate that you seem like 2 very different personalities. Therapy is extremely helpful in these cases \ud83d\ude4f",

    "postText": "I want to leave my husband we\u2019ve been married just a few days of over a year and been together roughly almost 4 years. I\u2019m just feeling like we don\u2019t get along. We never have anything positive to say to the other. Sometimes it turns physical and I don\u2019t know if I can handle another episode of him wanting to put his hands on me and try to choke the breathe out of me. I\u2019ve seen the rush he gets by seeing me scream and beg him to stop. But the evil in his eyes is lit up by excitement hurting me. I just am not happy with him anymore. I don\u2019t know if I ever really was I just was overwhelmed that a man wanted to be in my life. But come to find out it\u2019s caused nothing but Anguish. Neither one of us is happy. I talk to other people before i desire texting him. When his name comes up on my phone it just brings the swarming anger inside me like I can feel the edginess of his call. His presence upsets me and everything he does just irritates the hell out of me. The thought of him with someone else anyone else excites me.! I can\u2019t fucking stand the man. And I wish he would just let me go and stop trying to hold on to us because it\u2019s making us both miserable. It\u2019s not love that we share, it\u2019s that he doesn\u2019t have anyone else to keep him company he doesn\u2019t want to be alone. If I try to leave he manipulates me to stay. I\u2019m scared to run cause he\u2019s violent and will find me and hurt me. I don\u2019t feel comfortable around him he\u2019s a narsassisstic abusing man and I want him out off my life",

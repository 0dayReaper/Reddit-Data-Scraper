My state has a high rate of drunk drivers and just bad drivers all around but I've never encountered anyone trying to run me off the road until now. It honestly took me a bit to calm down. I didn't realize how hard I was breathing until I got inside my house. I immediately turned my computer on and started distracting myself by surfing Reddit.",

I\u2019m glad you were able to calm yourself down by surfing Reddit. That\u2019s a good way to distract yourself and find some entertainment or comfort. I\u2019m curious how you manage to surf on Reddit despite most subreddits going private in protest against Reddit\u2019s policies. That must be frustrating and limiting for you.",

    "postText": "Drove home this morning and cried in my car.\n\nWe\u2019re starting to see COVID-19. We are a small hospital. We have to re use our masks and place them in a bag (I had to use a cup) all day. The elastic got loose and I had gaps when I went into the room of a presumptive positive. They add tests on after we may have been exposed. \n\nPeople are lying about their travel history. People are stealing our supplies. People are yelling at us in public for wearing clean scrubs. \n\nIf I get on quarantine I will lose pay. I live paycheck to paycheck and I have two very small children. I will lose my car, my home, my children\u2019s daycare and I won\u2019t be able to afford food if I get quarantined or sick. \n\nWhat if I get sick and they accuse me of catching it at the grocery store or from the father of my children- who is also healthcare?\n\n\nI hate every single person brushing this off.\n\nMy career is my life. I eat, sleep and breathe it. I want to either fix people or escort them to the next life with dignity and respect. \n\nI\u2019m petrified of what is going to happen, but I can\u2019t imagine ever leaving this field.\n\n\nEdit:\nThank you to everyone who has offered support and love. I encourage everyone to support their local hospital and other essential people like grocery store and gas station employees. Keeping it local will help the community. \n\nAnd to those bashing me:\nNurses don\u2019t make much where I am. Saying nurses make a lot is a lie. Also I did take an oath and I will honor it. This was posted after a horrible shift. I will never regret this decision and I will go to work without doubting my choices.  I love my community and will keep taking care of them until I can\u2019t.",

Most of our nurses are directly employed but we have some contracted nurses who don\u2019t work directly for hospital. We have been told that any illness from this is not covered under our workman\u2019s comp. I will definitely fight this if needed but that\u2019s not the true issue here. \n\nIf we get exposed without the correct PPE, our hospital system is mandating a 14 day quarantine before returning to work. Since there\u2019s no injury or illness, workman\u2019s comp and disability insurance won\u2019t cover it. I get paid on a per shift basis. This means I can potentially be sent home for 14 days with no pay. My income allows me to absorb this hit, but it will still hurt. Unfortunately, for our nurses this isn\u2019t always the case.",

I wish we could stay at a near by hotel so that we wouldn\u2019t have to worry more about our families.

The government bails out businesses time after time with no long-lasting restrictions on companies in the aftermath to keep them from exploiting people and ultimately failing again. I want my money back, and until the government can fix the mess they ultimately put us in by being so negligently ill prepared for a pandemic like this, we shouldn't have to pay for virtually anything. If the government can entirely fund multi-billion dollar businesses and stupid stuff like research on the effects of playing Farmville on Facebook (this is actually a thing they paid millions for), they can fund us. I don't care, find the money somewhere like you always manage to find the money to fund a war.",

Imagine how exposed they are to everything. It's insane. Not to mention, there's also a huge risk that they might bring these things home, exposing and risking the lives of their families (like myself, even though I've been working from home this entire time).\n\nOn top of that, medical staff is not being tested AND they're only being put on quarantine if they show symptons. Which means, sooner or later, the whole hospital might be infected because there's staff spreading the virus around due to the hospital's management poor planning. Not to mention, the hospital was already pretty understaffed before this whole situation.\n\nOn social media, all you see is people praising medical staff, the nurses, etc, but a few month ago, when nurses were on strike asking for better working conditions (a strike that got shutdown in a very shady way by our government) everyone was complaining about them being lazy or that they didn't deserve better salaries. Apparently, the only thing medical staff deserve is a pat on the back and a \"Good job\". More money and better/safer working conditions? Nah, gotta spend that money on retired congressmen's pensions or bailing out banks.",

That you didn't have contact with infectious individuals outside of work.\n6. The day that you decide to stop working due to your health status, if you feel you're infected.  Get tested if possible.  Log your positive test status.  Log this communication with the hospital.  Scan in all of your prior logging.\n\nAs soon as you stop working, file a worker's comp claim and disability claim.Notify your employer.  Don't use up your PTO.  Just file worker's comp and disability early.\n\nNote that what matters in court is proof.  Show up with stacks of paper logs and the hospital lawyers will settle asap.  \n\nAlso, logging the fact that you're the first in your family to get infected is important.  Tell the court that your significant others did not get sick first.  And that you were self-quarantined/isolated outside of work.  Leave no room for other infection vectors as far as proof.\n\nIf you infect your immediate family, file for civil damages for every individual against the hospital.  Log the following:\n\n1. Medical costs for you and your loved ones.\n2. Time out of work for your loved ones.  Missed pay.\n3. Other damages (deposits on things you had to cancel due to being sick)\n\nThe hospital did not protect you, you got infected and got your family infected as well.  I'd go to court with stacks of paperwork.  Lawyers will be happy to help you.  If you've got all proof printed out, you're the best kind of plaintiff.  Learn to think like a lawyer.  Document, document, document.\n\nIf every healthcare worker did this, I feel that hospitals would up their game when it comes to having enough PPE stock and also hiring enough staff.

First is that testing is taking on average 5-7 days to come back right now, and the sensitivity of the tests are low enough that a negative test doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t have the virus (false negatives).  Supplies are also limited so many exposed workers aren\u2019t actually being tested.\n\nWhat\u2019s been happening is that workers are getting exposed for whatever reason. Typically it\u2019s that a patient who wasn\u2019t identified as a potential covid19 initially, later gets symptoms, is tested, and turn up positive a week later, typically after they are discharged. Now everyone who saw that patient has potential exposure. Often times it\u2019s without proper PPE because we are saving it for the higher risk rule outs. \n\nMy hospital system, and anecdotally a lot of others my friends work at, are requiring a 14 day quarantine if you are identified as possibly exposed.  Because you\u2019re not sick or injured, workman\u2019s comp and disability insurance don\u2019t apply. The hospitals are forcing us to use PTO for compensation. If you don\u2019t have PTO you don\u2019t get paid. This is particularly bad for hospitalists as most of us are paid per shift or per RVU (based on what we bill). Most physicians can absorb this cost, but a good amount of hospitalists like myself are still living like residents and trying to pay off loans.",

But that's why we never have to go it alone. Whether it is your battalion, your crew, your military unit, or your hospital unit, we are all in this together. Every American is in this together. Rely on your fellow nurses and focus on executing the plan every day.\n\nAnd you will NOT lose your home or go hungry. Have faith in that. We are all suffering together and we will all make it through this as best we can. Take each day in stride. You have to have faith in people. Have fsith that your landlord or your mortgage company will defer payments through this national emergency. Have faith that your hospital administrators will do the right thing. Have faith that your county health division will come through.\n\nYou are right, people are blowing this off - going on Spring break, not staying home, etc. And unfortunately you are on the front lines of the pandemic so you see the worst of people's behavior - the hoarding supplies, the lying, etc. But just know that your community needs you and will respect you for doing what you do. For all the nastiness you see, just know there is an equal amount of greatness inside you for dealing with it. And that greatness you'll never see because you're too busy, too consumed, with just doing it.\n\nBless you for being a nurse and I am here if you ever need a friend. \u2764 Much love and stay safe.",

There was a news story about a nurse being assaulted at a gas station. Another one about them being sprayed with Lysol. I spend a few minutes in each room a day but these nurses are spending hours with 4-5 patients who are (potentially) carrying the virus. We need to start treating our nurses like the heroes that they are. Not many of us would even be willing to do this job, and most of them are doing so without public objection. But when you talk to them, they are scared, tired, and being taken advantage of by the system. Please respect your nurses. They are the backbone of this system and if we don\u2019t treat them well, we are all going to pay the price for it.",

(I work twelve hour shifts) instead of working four days a week I'm working 5-6, they keep pressuring me to work the hospitals, my son has a severe dairy allergy, I have a peanut allergy, and every store I go to is out of something we need. I go to a different store everyday looking for almond milk, I don't see my kids at all in my work week. and we're barely living paycheck to paycheck because my bosses have lied three times about giving me the raise they promised me six months ago. (I've been applying to jobs for the last two months) Last night Walmart didn't have anything from our online order, so even with this overtime I'm still worried about feeding my kids",

The psych hospital I work at just spent $67,000 to replace door knobs on about 100 doors, because the Joint Commission said they have to, and they have to be somehow certified to be suicide-proof or something and apparently that's stupidly expensive. Practically identical products from a regular hardware wholesaler would have costed a fraction of the amount. The ER I work at bought a few label printers for lab vials, at about $1000 a piece; my uneducated guess is that a similar product would have costed $100-200 on the consumer market. The barcode scanners we use for scanning patient armbands and medications cost hundreds a piece, but they're simple devices which probably don't cost more than a few dollars per unit to manufacture.\n\nBig pharma is evil, yes, but big medicalequipment is fleecing us without anyone talking about it.\n\nEdited to add: nurse pay in my region starts at about $18.50/hr for new grads. It's one of the lowest in the US but we also have a lower than average cost of living. I don't know where OP lives or what is their pay rate, but that may give you a frame of reference.",

It's not as risky as your job by far but I feel some of that stress. My other job was cooking - ouch. Sadly, this pandemic is showing everyone's true colors.\n\n\nI know you're on social media like the rest of us just understand it's pretty toxic right now (kinda toxic always, but really bad now). It's true a lot of people are voicing support for those in the field but right now that's not a good place to be getting it. Talk to your coworkers and people in the field, not the general public. People will praise health care workers and other essentials online and then yell at them and lie to them. It's not real support - it's for their benefit not yours. \n\n\nAs far as people brushing it off - Anxiety and desperation makes fools of us all. as easy as it is to blame them, the real problem was our shit leaders who weren't prepared and left all of this to for-profit institutions that exploit everyone, and \"let the market decide\" instead of rationing and other measures. Make sure they know that: They were abandoned. We all were. Please forgive them. We're all victims of their greed. \n\n\nThere's nothing dignified about what's happening now. I know you want people to have that but death is messy, stinky, and ugly. Do what you can but understand this is the new normal for awhile, you're a limited resource, and one our leaders have determined to be expendable. Don't let them use your desire to do good to put you in dangerous situations. And don't listen to the crap about how heroic this is. They set the building on fire and it's scummy to hear them say \"oh look, heroes!\" You were *drafted* into this war. Dying in it isn't honorable or glorious - it's ugly and it's okay to be scared and angry.\n\n\nIt's going to be hard the next few months. You're going to be hurt over and over and beat yourself up for not doing enough - because you have a heart. And everyone is using that against you now. It's abusive and this will be with you long after this is over and everyone else moves on. Whatever happens, whatever people say, remember who you were today and when it's over, really over... Go back, sit down next to her, put your arms around her, and bring her home. Who you are now is worth any price. Remember this when it's over.",

You have every right to be scared by the risks and outraged by the situation we\u2019re in. We can\u2019t change the situation but there might be alternatives to that feeling of being trapped and powerless and scared. Maybe you\u2019re like me: planning prevents panic? \n\nCheck around at home, online, and with neighbors and acquaintances if they have supplies, especially masks. I\u2019ve been surprised by what I\u2019ve turned up, my brother-in-law\u2019s \u201cpainting masks\u201d were actually legit N95s. I found out my old 3M 6000 respirator that I use in my shop can be fitted with filters that are N95 or better. Never even considered that before last week, now I have some more coming in the mail. Face shields can be made out of 8 1/2 x 11 transparency paper, a bit of foam or surgical towel, and an elastic; check your local office supply or go online. Reach out to your coworkers to do the same. One of the RNs in my unit got a whole trash bag of assorted masks donated from her husband\u2019s contractor union.\n\nYou\u2019re right. This is complete bullshit. We deserve better. Our government has failed us and our hospital administrations have failed us. This is indeed a shitty time with a lot of shitty decisions being made that we have no control over. And that\u2019s completely, criminally unfair right now. \n\nBut we\u2019re also used to that. Remember: you\u2019re still a nurse. You\u2019ve made your ability to be smart, resourceful, and flexible into a career that other people would run screaming from. Get yourself home and comfortable. Take a shower, meditate, work out, whatever helps clear your mind. Give yourself a chance to decompress and relax, let your mind uncoil it\u2019s springs. There may be options you haven\u2019t thought of yet.\n\nWe\u2019re not heroes but we don\u2019t have to wait to be victims, either. If you can do anything to protect yourself, your family, your community, your patients, and your coworkers, now is the time to act. If they can do anything to help us, now is the time to ask.\n\nHelp is late and it\u2019s coming slow, but it **is** on the way. You can do this!",

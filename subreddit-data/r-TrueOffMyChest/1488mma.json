    "postText": "I (17f) am in the top choir of my school district. Our group gets to go to tons of l events both during and after school, like retirement homes to carol, free tickets to major league sporting games we sing at, and at this particular event an annual town hall lunch meeting. \n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first event we\u2019ve been at where the mayor had spoken, so it wasn\u2019t his first time meeting us, he usually greets us with an awkward hello, a quick chat with our director, and a direction on where to go and when we sing. But this time we\u2019re greeted by a secretary and then promptly shoved into a corner room no bigger than a 15ft by 15ft area (there\u2019s about 24 of us). I was admittedly a little upset as we were promised lunch at this meeting since we were taken out of school the hour before lunch would\u2019ve started. About 30 minutes later our director came in to give us a game plan. We were supposed to sing around the end of the meeting which was about an hour and a half of waiting time for us. She then wishes us good luck and walks back to her table shutting the door behind her. As we all start to get comfortable the mayor\u2019s voice comes over an intercom in the room. \u201cGreat now we have to listen to one of his year-long speeches,\u201d I joked with my best friend. We laughed and got quickly to ignoring his monotone voice and talking in a group with some of the others about our day.\n\nAround 20 minutes later conversations died down enough for us to overhear the mayor inviting a guest speaker up to the podium. \u201cI know I\u2019ve been talking for a while, but I\u2019d like to invite a lady with an amazing story to talk about her children, I promise you her story will not disappoint! This is Tina Rinne!\u201d His voice almost sounded like a game announcer\u2019s, we heard clapping outside the door and then a soft, frail voice from a woman came over the intercom.\n\nShe started off her speech talking about where she met the mayor. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to get out of my house much but the one thing I can consistently do is go to the park clean up my children\u2019s playground. During one of the park clean ups, I met the mayor and he asked me to come tell my story today.\u201d Her voice was solemn and shaky. \u201cAbout 18 years ago, my son Sam and my daughter Lindsey went to their dad\u2019s place for the weekend, and they had set up an outing to Worlds of Fun (a local amusement park). It was like every other weekend until I got a text from him reading \u2018you\u2019ll never see Sam and Lindsey again\u2019.\u201d \n\nThis was when all 24 of us went silent, and we all connected the dots that her children were dead. You could hear soft crying over the intercom with soft words of apologies for crying to accompany it. \u201cMy husband did not drop my kids off at school that Monday,\u201d Hear sobs continued. \u201cBy the time police came to my husband\u2019s door he had already fled, and for the next few weeks he continued to message me, telling me he had sold our children off to pedophiles or how he had shipped them out to another country.\u201d The whole room sat in horror blankly staring at each other. \u201cNo story was the same so I didn\u2019t know which horror I should\u2019ve believed, or if I should\u2019ve believed they might have still been alive.\u201d \n\nFor the next few minutes, the mother of the two children talked about the gruesome details of her ex husband\u2019s messages and the horrific discovery of her children\u2019s bodies, they were found in a forest a few towns over. Everyone\u2019s jaws were on the floor. She then talked for a bit about the park they made to memorialize her children and how her ex was found guilty of the kidnapping and murder of her children. Not a soul could move in that moment. She thanked the audience for listening to her story and walked off of the stage. \n\nThat\u2019s when our stupid mayor came back on the microphone and joyfully said \u201cI told you that story wouldn\u2019t disappoint!\u201d There was an audible gasp both in and outside of the room, he then continued, \u201cThat did not sound like a happy marriage.\u201d If all of our jaws weren\u2019t already on the floor they certainly were now. This ugly excuse of a man not only made it completely obvious that he gave zero shits about this woman and her story, but also made a completely insensitive joke about her trauma. I\u2019m disgusted by his total disrespect. I just had to write this all out, if you want more information on the murders look up Sam and Lindsey Porter.",

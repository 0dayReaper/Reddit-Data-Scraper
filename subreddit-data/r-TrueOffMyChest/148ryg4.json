    "postText": "I quit earlier this year because of college since it was stressful, but it's better stressing from working and at the end of the day knowing that I'll get a paycheck every month,  and not getting stressed from your mother yelling at you because she's drinking my pills and probably lied about my doctors diagnosis. \n\nI get dizzy all the time and can't stand for a long period of time since i start to get sick and nauseous, the doctor gave me some pills so i could get better and told me to do some tests. \n\nMy mom took them I told her not to take them to the doctor, I wanted to go personally because once she hid a diagnosis from me but she didn't listen and went by herself (i was at college and didn't tell me anything)  when she came back she told me \"the doctor said you're totally fine, you just have to drink your pills\"  really? then why do I get dizzy all the time? Why can't i stand without feeling nauseous? And on top of that she has been drinking my pills, they're supposed to help with that but she is the one drinking them. \n\nI cant stand her selfishness, i want to work and buy my own things so I no longer have to rely on her or anybody else.\n\nThe past few months have been hell, i come home from university and have nothing to do for the whole day and she just annoys me",

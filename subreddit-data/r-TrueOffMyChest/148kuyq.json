    "postText": "My boyfriend and I of 6 years broke up a couple weeks ago. I feel like I should be upset about it but I don't feel like I am. It was a neglectful relationship. I felt like I was asking for the bare minimum and consistently having my needs/wants ignored. Being told to speak up about what was bothering me only to be dismissed or belittled ultimately caused me to stop bringing up anything to him. We saw each other only a few days a month, I spent the rest of my time waiting around for him to maybe see me.  I felt controlled even though there was a distance between us, a distance he created. \nLike I said, we broke up a few weeks ago, and it's been silence from him ever since.  So no, I don't feel upset, even though I should.",

You didn\u2019t try to make this into something it wasn\u2019t and get yourself distraught over someone you knew was not meeting your needs and caring for you. Good for you!",

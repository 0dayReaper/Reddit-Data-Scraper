Also pack things that are heirloom or sentimental. \n\nIf either parent asks what you're doing, just tell them you're sorting out your room. Throwing away things you don't need. They don't need to know the truth, and you're allowed to lie to protect yourself.\n\nTake pictures of your wounds and keep them in your phone. If you're able to, go to the police station or to your town hall to ask if there's any programs to help adults leave abusive situations. You may be able to have a program help you with deposit and rent on a new place. \n\nNotify your job, in case the transition is rough. Be sure if your step-dad goes off the rails that if he ever shows up at your job that you would rather not see him while you're on shift, particularly if he is violent.",

Love can be trap you, sometimes you need a hard push to get out of something toxic.\n\nSecond, always protect yourself, collect all data. Collect all evidence. When things starts to become hotter, report to authorities. And I guess you are afraid to stand up to him. Mostly the thing with abusers is also trauma and take it out on the ones showing weakness and being in fear. If you know how to stand up, show seriousness and no fear. His reaction will be very different. Learn pressure points of the body (asian fight arts) and use that against any who is violence to you. Have something like a super bright mini flashlight, which you can use in your hand whenever you have to strike back, use the brightness to blind him.\n\nGood luck, I wish you all the best.",

    "postText": "Story is funny to me now but back a few years ago when I was 14 there was this really attractive girl in the year above who I had a crush on. I would speak to her sometimes in a friendly way but I really just wanted to tell her how I felt. Eventually one day at a party I finally got the confidence to ask her out. There was definitely drinking going on so no one was really thinking clearly so I figured if she said no I could probably blame being drunk or something.\n\nSo I found her and talked for a bit while I built up the courage and I finally told her how I felt. Except after saying this she told me another boy in the same year as her said the same thing to her earlier. Someone overheard and brought the other guy over to us and now he was telling me to back off since he asked first. I tell him no and we argue for a bit before the girl says she has an idea. She said we should measure our dicks and whoever had a bigger dick she would go out with. I was dumb and horny so I agreed and so did he. Next thing I know she takes us to a bedroom and tells us to get our dicks out while she gets a ruler out. So we both pull our underwear down and one at a time she puts the ruler up to our penises and measures. Once shes done she tells us that the other guy is bigger and they both leave together, leaving me standing there with my penis out in the middle of a random bedroom. Looking back she was definitely crazy so I got lucky there but damn did it hurt at the time.",

    "postText": "My boyfriend of 2 years and I\u2019ve been looking for an intern position on plenty organizations in the city where we live and nearby. My cousin help me to get an interview and now bc of my mother I know I got the job. But the thing is my boyfriend doesn\u2019t have any offers yet. I don\u2019t know how to help him to get an offer, I wanna see him living his dreams, my win is not a win if he is having a hard time and sometimes I feel I should be having an awful time to. I am scared we grow appart if I go to this job bc it is in another city and he has no offers, not even here in our city. Idk how to support him and I really wanna marry this guy.\nI\u2019ve been thinking I shound turn down the position and continue searching for another jobs in the area, but man idk who to tell, he is also my bestfriend, I\u2019m a mess rn.",

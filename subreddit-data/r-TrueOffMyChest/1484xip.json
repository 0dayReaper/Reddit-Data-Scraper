    "postText": "Never done this before. Just felt so lonely lying there next to my husband, who I adore, but who just wouldn\u2019t touch me or hold me or kiss me\u2026 i showed him my date night dress, i had a shower where i got all freshened up and shaved all my bits imagining maybe he\u2019d notice, i sat in his lap wearing lingerie, i touched and caressed him when we got into bed, I tried to kiss him, but he just held his arms to his side and kept his face turned away and turned his back and I tried to be easy and no pressure and like I wasn\u2019t really asking because that way I didn\u2019t risk an overt rejection but i just feel so rejected. \nId like to believe it was just bad timing on my part and he\u2019s just tired and stressed but he. So rarely wants me. And this isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been rejected and it won\u2019t be the last. I love him so much, this one really hurt for some reason.",

If he doesn\u2019t show you love, take yourself out to your favorite restaurant and treat yourself.\n\nLove you enough not to beg for his attention.\n\nOnly you can decide stay or go. \n\nHowever, \u201cyou owe you\u201d the good life!",

I crave physical affection more than he does. Sometimes i think he doesn\u2019t need it, or doesn\u2019t think he should. \n\nThe other morning he initiated and i was so surprised and happy!!!! After I asked him what prompted that and his answer was something like he had morning wood which reminded him that it exists. Its like for him, he believes he\u2019s not a sexual being. And maybe doesn\u2019t deserve to be one? I dont know. He\u2019s a funny one. \n\nI\u2019m pathologically optimistic and I believe in him and in us and i will never give up. I know there\u2019s a sexual being in there because it shows up once in a while! It just needs some encouragement. \n\nBy the way, my apologies for TMI. I just needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for listening!",

Just because i want it doesn\u2019t mean he has to put out!!! I know he loves me. Im going to mindfully practice gratitude and generosity. \n\nHe came down to find me in the morning feeling so worried and we went back upstairs and spent an hour just cuddling before getting up. I was just desperately craving affection, and that was lovely and affectionate and loving. Sigh. Its hard sometimes. Im not perfect. We\u2019re both fucked up in ways. \n\nIf I\u2019m not careful he\u2019ll slip into a comfortable no-sex routine fairly easily. I feel like its on me to keep the fire lit but i don\u2019t know how, I\u2019m not some confident sexy goddess. Im awkward af.",

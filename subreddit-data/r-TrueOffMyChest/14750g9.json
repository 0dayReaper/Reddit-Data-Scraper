    "postText": "So I ended up showing my bf all the dm\u2019s and  comments I got and he was baffled by all the warnings. He admitted that he never thought of it that way and didn\u2019t realize the seriousness of his son\u2019s situation. He thanked me for trying to find a way not only to save my baby but also to help his son so he doesn\u2019t get hurt in the future. He said that he probably needs to ask for help from professionals and maybe go to family therapy with his son to understand his attitude towards helpless pets. He has never owned one and his mother never liked animals but that doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s cruel to them. \n\nHe spoke to her about it over the phone and I heard her yelling about how my bf was blowing this out of proportion and that her son is just a normal boy being boy but my bf was firm and told her that he wanted to understand why his son is being so cruel and she couldn\u2019t stop him getting help.\n\nAs for us, I told him that I never wanted his son near my dog again. Whether they can work things out or not, go to the bottom of the problem or not I don\u2019t want my baby to be his son\u2019s guinea pig, to teach him to be kind. My bf agreed and he is going to tell his son that he wasn\u2019t allowed to be near my dog. Not even to pet him. My dog never goes for my stepson because he is scared and doesn\u2019t like him so it\u2019s not gonna be a problem from our part.\n\nMy bf also agreed to pay for dog-care, with possibility of overnight stay the weeks I work a lot and can\u2019t be at home when stepson is staying with us because I made it clear that I don\u2019t trust not being there for my dog if stepson is home. \n\nMy bf thanked me for agreeing to this because he didn\u2019t think me moving out the weeks his son is home is a good idea. He thinks that it is important for all of us that I\u2019m in his son\u2019s life and not only a gf and I agree with that. If we want to try this as a family I can\u2019t live on my own half the time. \n\nThank you again for helping us with this matter by helping my bf see reason \u263a\ufe0f thank you a million",

            "comment": "I remember vividly that one of the very rare times my father ever resorted to violence was when I experimentally tied our dog's front legs together - I really wasn't malicious, and it wasn't tight, I just wanted to see if he could free himself. My father slapped me pretty hard, and told me to never do anything like that to any animal ever again - and I definitely didn't (probably wouldn't have, anyway, cause I loved animals and cuddled every one I could get my grubby little hands on - but it certainly drove the lesson home).\n\nI'm glad your bf saw the light - but what the heck is up with that mother? Maybe she is abusing him at home, and that's where he learned it. Would certainly explain why she doesn't want him near a therapist. Or maybe she just can't accept that anyone dares to criticize her perfect little angel.",

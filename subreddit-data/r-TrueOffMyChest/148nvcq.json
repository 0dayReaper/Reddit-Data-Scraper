    "postText": "From day one, both me and my fiance have stated that the wedding reception will be child-free, seeing as we're not having a \"traditional\" ceremony and reception, and the reception is pretty much just a potluck style dinner and drinking. It's only now, a little less than two months away from the wedding, that she decided to pick a fight while at work. Her reasons that we shouldn't have a child free wedding are \n\nIt's stupid\n\nIt's excluding family members (she didn't even ask if we had accommodations, I was going to try and figure something out but no one had asked yet)\n\nThat I would be responsible for anyone drinking and driving \n\nNo one does child free weddings\n\nI'm a bitch and she didn't raise me like this \n\nShe's now going around telling other family members not to go, she canceled the photographer, is now saying she's not going to allow me to play DND, doesn't want to go to the ceremony, and canceled the venue. I really am at a loss for what to do, because both me and my soon to be husband want a child-free wedding, but now she's being manipulative and is completely screwing everything up. I am absolutely heartbroken and defeated.\n\n\nEDIT: Just to clarify a few questions that are being frequently asked, my husband and I are paying for the wedding. My mother was going to pay for the photographer, so she is perfectly within her right to do that. She's able to cancel all of these things, quite frankly, because we live in a somewhat small town and almost everyone we had hired knew our family in some way, or was just straight up a close family friends. I did have a plan to either pay for a babysitter for my brother's kids or figure that out in some way, but he refuses to even talk to me about this now because my mother got to him first and pretty much told him I said directly that I don't like his kids and don't want his family there. He's never had a very good relationship with me, so it doesn't surprise me that he's going along with what my mother said. It's not that this has made the wedding completely undoable for us, it's just that I am so upset that my own mother is refusing to attend my wedding and now it looks like several family members won't go because of something so dumb.",

It sounds like you should contact the family and ask if anyone needs to go over arrangements for kids, etc.  Then tell your mom she can spend her time doing something else while you celebrate your future life with your husband. Congratulations, BTW.",

And she wants to get away from her toxic mom. So a few red flags.\n\nWhatever about getting married, I do hope they wait to have kids.",

I have two children. At no time did I complain about my family members choices. It\u2019s their wedding. They are paying for it and they can have what they want. If I want to go then I have to make arrangements. If I can\u2019t get a babysitter then I can\u2019t go. That simple. It was my choice to have children therefore it is my responsibility and my place to make the sacrifices such as not going if that is the case. It is what it is. Child free weddings as a parent are a blessing! Time off to have fun without the kids!  \n\nYou are really young (by Aussie standards) to be getting married. If this is what you want then go ahead and make your adult choices. She still views you as a child because not that long ago you were. If you want to be treated like an adult then act like one which means making decisions that are for yourself and your future outside of what your parents want or choose for you. It\u2019s not easy but this could be an opportunity to make a stand knowing that by doing so you will face opposition and disgruntlement but that is a part of growing up. \n\nAs an adult you don\u2019t need her permission or approval. You just have to be comfortable with the fall out of our decisions because we can only control our own reactions or emotions.",

No one wants to be worried about children well\u2026.being children. Weddings are a rare occassion that some adults get to actually get out of the house. Now onto a solution, look into if your city hall has a rent space. My town has one with a full kitchen and bathroom that you can rent for $500-700 depending on day. It\u2019s pretty small but if your invitation list is essentially cut in half or smaller that could work. Do a quick ceremony with a party after with your friends. I know it sucks not having family there but think of it like this, your mother is intentionally ruining what should be one of the happiest days of your life with no intention of trying to see your side or even understand. She\u2019s actively turning family against you because you aren\u2019t doing what SHE wants. Do you really need that negative energy dulling down your shine ?",

Every hotel has either a Justice of the peace available to do weddings wherever you want it. Wanna get married in a bikini by the pool? Do it. Your mother can throw wedding for herself. You and your fianc\u00e9 deserve a happy wedding and a happy time that is intimate and only for you two.",

The thing that will piss her off the most is you not allowing her to see that you\u2019re upset\u2026don\u2019t give her the satisfaction!!  Stay low key, very low communication &amp; just make your plans.  Whether you keep the arrangements you had planned on, go to the courthouse or elope.  This is all up to you &amp; your fianc\u00e9.  \n\nHonestly, since you live with your mom and your wedding is still almost 2 months away\u2026I\u2019d want out sooner than later.  What\u2019s to say she won\u2019t try more ways to sabotage it.  Just think about it\u2026maybe go to the courthouse to get married in the next week or so &amp; don\u2019t tell anyone.  You can always throw a reception later or even for your one year anniversary.  It\u2019s your wedding; do things the way you want.  If there\u2019s anyone who pushes back, don\u2019t include them in the conversations or plans.  Good luck and just do what makes you happy!!",

Invite your fianc\u00e9\u2019s family if they aren\u2019t as psycho crazy as your mom. There\u2019s no coming back from this level of a temper tantrum from your mom. She took your wedding day and made it about herself and her shitty complaints. The only thing you can do is make her stew in her anger as you still enjoy yourselves and have an even better time without these bitter spiteful people at your ceremony. Bet you donuts to dollars that if any of these attention seeking whores made it to your wedding, they\u2019d have done something to steal the spotlight from you. They\u2019d have brought their children anyways \u201ccause they didn\u2019t think you were serious\u201d or \u201cyour mom said that the wedding isn\u2019t childfree\u201d or some other lame excuse.",

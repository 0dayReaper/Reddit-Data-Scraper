    "postText": "I have ibs-d which means basically I uncontrollably shit myself and at the height of my stomach issues, getting adjusted on meds it was summer and I live on a lake, so my family and family friends went out on the lake, I took an Imodium to be safe but like 3 hours in the heat is starting to get me, we are like 30 minutes boat ride to the nearest bathroom, it hits me Satan hits my asshole and I panic and I jumped in the water and swim away from the people in the water and pull my swim suit bottoms to my knees and just let Satan come through my body through my ass hole. My stomach hurt so bad but it felt so good when I was done. No one knew, but I pulled my shorts up and sat in the water for like 45 minutes made sure I was clean and then got back on the boat and sanitized my hands and went about my day. I have never told anyone but I think it\u2019s pretty funny.",

    "postText": "So we're here at day 1, I got together with her on the first day of this year and we went out for a month physically after which she had to go abroad for a semester. It became a long distance relationship and in the first few weeks of LDR it was very difficult, but we made it through and were quite happy, we fell in love, we loved each other we were everything a happy couple in love is. Until last month. Last month we had some disagreements and it was frankly my fault because I had said something distasteful. I did apologise at the time and in the coming days but her intimacy went away and she even told me that she does not see me as a romantic partner anymore. Later she told me that it was not the distasteful thing but my behaviour overall and she is tired of it. Now to be fair I did realise that I did at many times thought that I was the reason whenever she felt upset at something and I did not realise at the time but that attitude of mine, probably made her feel that her feelings are downplayed/invalidated. There might've been more things maybe. \n\nWe stayed together, fast forward 2 weeks, I ask her about the issue of having romantic feelings and she goes that she is sorry and that it is a breakup. I was not ready for that maybe? the reason being that she had told me what was wrong and maybe not overnight but I thought that those things could be hopefully worked on while keeping in boundaries and staying myself. The breakup just made me feel that it's not worth it ending it just like that. I try to ask her for a chance, she gives one and we move on. In reality I think she did not, because just before breaking up now, she has been telling me that she stayed with me just to ease me through our breakup as she does care for me (and love me but not romantically). A note here would be that I do have anxiety attacks very rarely and she has seen me in some so maybe that is why she tried to be like that. Well now she confronted me and said that I am not respecting her when she is telling me to breakup, that I am forcing her to stay and she broke up in anger and left. (which in this case means stopped picking up my calls). I thought we were trying to make things better but no she had made up her mind and instead felt that I am forcefully keeping her. I cannot do that, I tried asking to make things better but to her it was something I was forcing so I had to let go, I cannot make someone feel like that. \n\nNow my side of the story is: I do love this person I obviously still do. I was with her because of that even when it seemed very hard (she does sometimes make it hard, reason being her life experiences) I do think she deserves to be loved like that, she has been through some traumatic life experiences and in my view she deserves an unconditional love and support that can make up for that. I obviously am not someone who is perfect or some prince, I did try to do that the best I could. I'm not an \"if-only\" person either mistakes do happen but I gave it my sincere everything. I do manage my emotions pretty well,\u00a0 I have a pretty solid group of friends I can talk to and go through stuff, for now a breakup maybe. In the end i'm ok. I do feel I connected well with her and we were good together but I cannot force her to stay with me obviously. She tells me that she is avoidant and I am anxious, which is a half correct assessment maybe. I did not know much about them but I read them up, she is a textbook avoidant, I might be anxious but maybe she is confusing my anxiety with anxious attachment style. I never was afraid to lose her, I did not want to preferably that is a yes but I never thought that everything would end once it happens. Neither have I compromised my boundaries to such an extent that I am willing to do anything to just keep her. I did try, I did everything I could and maybe during that I came off like that but those are my thoughts internally. \n\nI just did not want to leave her like this, she has been having such a hard time there, she is depressed, is hardly talking with anyone and for the most part I was the only one she was talking. The details can go on and on but she is not great right now, with or without the breakup, and it has been like this for some time now. This is the first relationship for both of us, so there are things she is not used to either, maybe talking soo much with me pushed her to this. Maybe staying away from each other for so long. I could continue coming up with speculations and it wouldn't help. So as of now she has broken up, she is coming back to the city I live in, within a month or so. I do cherish what we were, I do love her still and I do care for her, she is a nice person but obviously I cannot force anything Thoughts?",

It sucks but that\u2019s reality. It doesn\u2019t matter why. It\u2019s just not something you should dwell on. Move on. It\u2019s over. Choose your self and don\u2019t give this more energy.",

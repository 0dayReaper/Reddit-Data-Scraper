    "postText": "Reddit's decision to slap a price on API access, which used to be free, has got the whole community stirred up. This has thrown a major curveball at third-party apps, and people are understandably riled up.\n\nBut it's not just about the new charge. The drama really amps up when you hear about this planned protest: a bunch of moderators from some of the biggest subreddits are threatening to flip the off switch on their communities on the 12th. And we're not talking just any subreddits here, but ones with subscriber counts hitting the hundreds of thousands to millions. The crazy part? These subs can be shut down by a handful of mods, no questions asked. Subscribers don't get a say. If Reddit can't see how absurd that is, then maybe it deserves the mess it's in.\n\nOn the money front, just take a look at Apollo, a third-party app that's now looking at a monthly bill of $1.7 million, thanks to the API pricing change. To break even, they'd have to charge each user about $2.50 per month, more than twice the current subscription cost. But here's the kicker: even if they did up their charge to around $5/month, would that be so bad if users really valued the app?\n\nWhat's truly strange is how these same people, who seem to have no problem dropping wads of cash on video game loot, suddenly turn penny pinchers when it comes to supporting platforms like Reddit or Youtube. I mean, isn't it worth paying something for the things you claim to love?",

    "postText": "Throwaway and Trigger warnings here for obvious reasons.\n\nIm sorry if this is rambly or overly long but its been weighing on me, and I don't know what to do. I have had panic attacks and Anxiety since I was a teenager. I didnt know until recently what I was experiencing was Anxiety... it was just life. I thought everyone felt this way. After having a panic attack at work I got referred to our Employee Assistance Program and they sent my to a psychiatrist. \n\nI didnt exactly know what I was supposed to talk about because I thought my childhood was pretty normal so i just talked about everything. I lived with a single mom and just did the single mom with two kids lifestyle. Admittedly I don't remember much of my childhood just like little picture book moments, my mom did scrapbooking so i used that as an example. Apparently this kind of memory is not normal and is called Dissociative Amnesia. It's a trauma response that your brain does where it just, stops saving things. He explained it was like a soldier who watched a comrade die. They will know it happened but can't recall anything that happened. Their brain just, didn't record the memory, to save them the pain later. If something is remembered it's just like a single point in time, or a flash bulb memory?\n\nAnd because I can't remember and details of when I was a child he thinks the same thing happened to me. I tried recalling events that happened but he said I wasn't recalling what I had seen or done but what others had told me about the events in question.  \n\nI didnt think much of it at the time and blamed everything on untreated adhd or something. Turns out the Doc doesn't agree. And he refered me to another psychiatrist for a wider examination. I a 500 question survey thing and a 2 hour chat later and I get a pdf that details everything me and Dr 2 talked about. \n\n6 pages outlining everything the doctor had seen in our appointment with detailed explanations and reasonings for each. \n\nAdhd \nPtsd\nMixed personality disorder \n\nAll items I could understand for the most part, stuff I had heard about before. \n\nBut the last bit was an explanation that these diagnosis show \"these issues are not representative of psychosis, but rather extreme reactions based on issues involving early traumatic experiences.\"\n\nI asked psych one what that meant and got the explanation listed in the title. My Anxiety and some other behaviors are likely because something happened to me when I was a kid and my brain blanked it out. Due to the nature of some behaviors Dr 1 thinks I was molested and Dr 2 corroborated this diagnosis. I know I'm dodging what I have done but its nothing bad just shameful. Dr 2 called it hyper-sexuality.\n\nSo here I am. A prescription and a referal to a therapist later. Just kinda floating. I don't know what to do with this information. I'm astranged from my mom for other reasons prior to this and when I asked my only sibling on the matter they said they weren't aware of anything happening. I don't know what to do now. I know I have a therapist appointment and talking to them will help but I can't do anything until the wait time clears up as the appointment is weeks away. Am I just supposed to sit with this for weeks waiting?",

There was a big movement like 25-30 years ago I think to uncover people\u2019s repressed memories and what happened a lot is that therapists actually helped their patients create false memories that were recanted later. IIRC, some people may have been jailed when false claims were laid against them? I was a kid and don\u2019t remember the details all that well. In any case, it\u2019s reasonable to be suspicious of someone telling you that you had an experience you don\u2019t remember. I agree with a other commenters suggesting you get a second opinion from a completely separate doctor who has not had this idea already seeded in his mind.",

It's a minefield of unprofessional and borderline criminal approach to an already complicated and disputed field.\n\nIndividuals react to trauma differently, but unless your sibling is part of a cover-up, I'd take their word over that of someone who could earn a lot of money from treating you for possibly \"imaginary\" trauma.\n\nPlenty of victims of CSA, especially if a habitual family dynamics, do remember and talk about it with other victims, or at least have glimpses of the assaults or bad memories linked to them (e.g. a relative of mine can't stand a specific colour likely due to childhood trauma).\n\nI'd be very very very wary of therapists being so adamant about stuff you didn't bring up yourself but are just inferring it from who-knows-where.",

            "comment": "I had a traumatic childhood as well. There are some terrible things that I remember, and instances a sibling or a parent will remember that I have no recollection of. \n\nI've been seeing therapists on and off since elementary school, but in my early 20s, when I was doing an intake session with a new therapist, she asked about my experience traumatic experiences. \nHave you experienced emotional abuse? \"Yes.\"\nPhysical abuse? \"Yes.\"\nSexual abuse? \"Not that I recall.\"\n...\nWait--wtf did I just say?? Am I telling myself something that I've blocked out? Was it just a weird choice of words I happened to use? \n\nI was very disturbed by my answer and wrestled with these questions for a very long time--years--until I finally came to the conclusion that, personally, I don't need an answer. If I was sexually abused and cannot recall it, my brain is hiding it from me with good reason. I have enough other mental bullshit that I can actually recall that still needs to be unpacked, I don't need to subject myself to uncovering/recovering potentially false memories for the sake of filling in gaps in my childhood recollection. \n\nI've also learned that having gaps in childhood memory is normal, regardless of your experience with trauma. \n\nIf I could impart any advice to you, it would be to be kind to yourself now and do that however it suits you best. It may take time to learn what kindness to yourself looks like, but keeping at it and caring for yourself now is what I think is most important.\n\nI hope any of this helped \u2764\ufe0f",

But trauma response isn't a one size fits all kind of thing it varies. Some trauma victims dissociate and their brain blanks completely out and they talk about totally irrelevant stuff after (especially when there's guilt involved), others can remember but the memory fizzles after some hours so they can't remember details very well, while for others the exact opposite is the case that the traumatic event is burnt into the brain and they even vividly remember smells etc. It's not so simple. \n\nIt's possible that you experienced traumatic events during childhood. It doesn't necessarily need to be SA though, it could be other things. There are several events that count as childhood trauma, eg one parent being in jail or having a parent pass away and some events are discussed to count as well (eg growing up in extreme poverty etc)\n\nI don't know what questionnaires you filled but now it sounds a bit like they are just guessing which childhood trauma it was which I find rather unprofessional. I can only say to not take their word immediately at face value but if you want to heal do some digging on your own if you're able to and get other opinions too.\n\nChildhood trauma can cause all kind of funky health problems beyond mental health if not dealt with but there's also the chance of retraumatizing so proceed with caution. Best of luck and I hope you'll be able to heal",

Old-school theorists suggest that you have to uncover trauma to heal someone, but modern theories discount this and even suggest it as possibly harmful. If you have no trauma memories, trust your memory. If you uncover something in therapy, like a memory comes back, great - heal from that. If not, sometimes benign household/life stress can cause gaps in memory. Many, many people have limited childhood memories not because they were abused, but just because nothing extremely notable happened. It's just as likely that you were a little emotionally neglected and were just left to your own devices as a child as it is something truly horrible happened.",

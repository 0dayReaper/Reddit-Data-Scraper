    "postText": "i\u2019m apart of a trip in college, myself riley and rhia (fake names) are all in a group of 6 in college only us three are the ones who actually talk outside of college, both rhia and riley live in my college town and my home town is an hour and a half away so i am home and working for the summer. We all know how trios go, two are closer and one is left feeling left out, well that\u2019s me. I know Rhia and Riley are going to be so much closer with eachother because they are closer in age then what i am to them, im 20 and they are both in late 20s and because they live in the same town. They have made me feel welcome and always ask my schedule every week to see if it could fit theirs but the only thing is Riley is always super busy and her schedule doesn\u2019t fit around mine. Rhia is free for the summer so she can hang whenever. Tomorrow is the first time i\u2019m seeing Rhia in a few weeks buti don\u2019t want to go, it seems that any time i\u2019m trying to make a plan Rhia is always asking Riley their plans even if they aren\u2019t free, yes i know that it\u2019s only bc she wants the three of us to hang out but my over thinking brain is making it seem that she doesn\u2019t want to hang one on one. I love Riley to bits also and ofc i do want to see them but idk seeing that kinda makes me sad. Yes when they make plans they invite me but i guess knowing that they can hang out a lot more and prefer eachother and are possibly going to grow closer without me there makes me sad, im not going to talk to them about this bc there\u2019s no point i\u2019d come off as clingy. I just wanted to rant",

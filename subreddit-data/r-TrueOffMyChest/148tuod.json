    "postText": "My wife and I are married for 7 years and in a relationship for 11 years now. In 2016, due to immaturity I resigned from my previous job, relied on her since I was planning to focus on my career. Months before our First Anniversary, she was telling me that they were doing Overtime because one of their branch just closed. After few weeks I checked a suspicious app on her phone and discovered that she was cheating on me. I hit her. We went home to her parents, not telling anything to my side because I dont want her name be stained and me, be scolded by my parents. Everytime I remember what she'd done, I was bursting out and hitting her. \n\nYears passed, we were both working, I found that she had several huge loans from other people, and buying some stuffs, things that she wished she had when she was young since she came from a poor family and only supported by her parents' side.  I started hitting her again due to the fact that she's a liar and a cheater. And only thing I really wanted was to make her happy although we're experiencing financial difficulties. I always telling her that she needs to think of the future.\n\nDue to her health conditions, I let her stopped working and take our son from her parents so that she can take care of him. After several months, my mother asked her to join in the military reservist training. Until her focus shifted again, and leaving our son at home while Im sleeping since Im working night shift. This relationship is deteriorating, and there was a time that we were in an argument and this time even if it is for discipline or not, I hit even our son which left a mark on his eye, they left and after 3 days they reported me to the authorities and filed a case. This decision was urged by his father without thinking that I sacrificed a great deal with her daughter, accepting her despite on being a liar and a cheater. \n\nWhile enduring the case, a woman contacted me and told me that she was the living partner of my wife's boyfriend. So during her devotion in the military, she was only meeting him. And during night, when Im at work, she was visiting him. My remaining affection towards her waned. Even that time when we were separated, she was visiting me to give financial support to our son, and have some adult moments, I confronted her and still kept denying. Despite of their pictures when they were together. I really hate her but I need to sacrifice my pride for our son.",

He\u2019s completely innocent of the toxic relationship you and your wife have created and chose to continue. If you hate her, just leave her. Do whatever is best for your son\u2019s wellbeing, not you or your wife\u2019s feelings or egos.",

            "comment": "We agreed to live together, despite on what happened again. Also to dismiss the case filed by their foxy little mind. I only thinking of my son, I really don't want him to grow up on her mom's place and wirhout a father. Now, almost 2years since this happened, everytime I remember what she had done to our relationship, I hit her. She is trying to do good things to my family and have a good relationship with her father in law and my grandmother, but still can't forgive her and forget what she did.\n\nI intentionally don't celebrate Valentine's Day and Anniversary about what happened but still my wife told me that Im good for nothing that's why and will remain like this until I grow up, financially unstable and even I'll have a new relstionship, my attitude will remain the same. But deep inside, I regret being with her, all I want is to have a civilized marriage and if there's an extra money, we'll buy something sweet to celebrate. \n\nAm I really good for nothing because Im sometimes arrogant and ignorant. Maybe a different girl will change me. Im thinking on waiting for a divorce bill here in the Philippines to be passed but also thinking maybe if I got older she can take care of me, same like spending time to take care of my elders.",

    "postText": "It started 13 years ago when I was pregnant w my youngest child, H started saying he fantasized about me sleeping w another man. At that time I only had eyes for him so this was not anything I would\u2019ve entertained. Several years ago he started mentioning a specific friend &amp; immediately I said no. I could never imagine myself being intimate with that friend. After a couple years I finally started to say \u201cwell, maybe\u201d until one day I completely gave in. We had regular 3sums for about a year and I was pretty comfortable with it although I was still shocked I was being intimate with that friend. The friend ended up moving away but H\u2019s desires never faded. When H suggested I download apps to find a 3rd I was hesitant bc I\u2019m not into meeting people online for sex. I put it off so long H downloaded the apps himself. Eventually we found someone who was looking for a couple. It was fun chatting but when it came time to meet I was very nervous. We met for drinks &amp; I was under the impression nothing had to happen that night. I thought it was cool to just meet and see how the chemistry was before jumping right into sex w a stranger. While we were at the table H would send me multiple texts at once asking if I was ready to leave &amp; go to the hotel. I told him I wasn\u2019t ready for sex but that the next time we met up I\u2019d feel more comfortable. H didn\u2019t stop. He sent 5 texts in a row saying \u201clet\u2019s do it\u201d in addition to several others. I couldn\u2019t handle it, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore &amp; I gave in. I said ok and I did it. I feel cheap. I feel used. I feel alone and unsupported. I feel like a prude and I feel like a whore. More than those I feel ashamed &amp; disgusted with myself bc I have nobody else to blame but myself. There was no gun to my head.  I would have done it eventually but I just wasn\u2019t ready &amp; sometimes that makes me feel like I deserve to feel this.",

Yes even though you agreed to do it it doesn't take away from the pressure you felt from your partner who you should trust and have your back but he instead focused on his desires. You should talk to him about all of this and how it's not okay that it has to be something you both want and he needs to respect your boundaries and decisions",

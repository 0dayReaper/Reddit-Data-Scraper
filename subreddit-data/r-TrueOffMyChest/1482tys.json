    "postText": "I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m dating this guy for 10 months. We were friends, almost best friends before we started dating for about 2-3 months. When we started dating I told him that I don\u2019t want to rush because I rushed my past relationships. After 6 months I was sure that I really want to commit a relationship. I felt safe around him. We did everything what an official couple did: spending Valentine\u2019s Day together, getting intimitate (what was very hard for me because of SA), sharing and cuddling in a bed together for 3 weeks straight, sharing our problems, spending time everyday even though we are having long distance, giving flowers and ofc saying I love you multiple times everyday. And now he\u2019s saying that I\u2019m not enough. He waited for me when I was unsure about us in the beginning and now when I\u2019m ready he\u2019s suddenly not ready. He still needs time even though he said he\u2019s ready for a relationship when we started dating. But I don\u2019t understand why. For what does he need time when we already act like a couple for almost a year. Even for our friends we are already a couple. His friends also call me his girlfriend. Now I really question myself if I really should wait or should maybe end up things. He\u2019s enjoying the privileges of having a partner even though he\u2019s not in a relationship. I don\u2019t want to say someone who\u2019s not my partner \u201cI love you\u201d. But I\u2019m scared that this will be the wrong decision. We will meet in 1 month again. I was enjoying his presence and gave him love like he was already my boyfriend. He wasn\u2019t the whole time. What should I do?",

When suddenly we both hear a big 'CRACK' noise. Turns out I smashed the speculum with my internal muscles. Oops.\n\nFor those worrying, she then asked me to change positions and breathe through it and got the smear test done with a new speculum easily enough.\n\nPower vajayjay. \ud83d\udcaa\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

I was always told I had the wrong angle or was just not pushing hard enough. \n\nAs a survivor of CSA, this makes so much more sense now. I had painful sex for a long time as well and in the last few years was mostly able to get past it, but likely because I had some counseling and started working on communicating my discomfort better with my husband.",

I couldn't even insert a finger without immense pain. After about a year of pelvic floor physio, using dilators for a few months and one botox injection I have had absolutely no issues since. The physio can feel a bit...intrusive at first (especially for SA trauma) but my physio was kind and professional and I trusted her very quickly. Good luck!",

Second, I hope you are okay! \n\nLastly, I was also going to suggest somatic therapy as trauma is stored in the body. Talk therapy generally doesn't work as you're essentially reliving the memories. Reframing how you view your trauma (i.e. I have survived all of my bad days, and my body loves me and is so amazing and fiercely protective of me that it developed a strong ass barrier!), I listened to the audiobook Neff's, ' Fierce Self Compassion' on my daily walks and it was really helpful. Any way you can connect to your body and nurture yourself is the way. \ud83d\udc6d\ud83d\udc9c",

There\u2019s a lot of stretching the pelvic floor, strengthening exercises, in my case we used a biofeedback that was inserted and allows you to see a visualization of how much your muscles are working/your resting state, as well as dilators. \n\nThis was just my experience though, people do pelvic floor therapy for many different reasons, not just vaginismus",

    "postText": "At court yesterday, the judge agreed that my ex husband gets to cripple me financially for the next 12 years by leaving a loan that was assigned to him in the divorce in my name, even though it prevents me from being able to finance things for my own life, including my dead grandmother\u2019s property which is now being sold outside the family. \n\nI\u2019m beyond shocked. Oh and I have to pay his attorneys fees? \n\nIn mediation, he forced me to refinance the house so his name wasn\u2019t on it (I kept it) and he could buy his current house. During mediation he was told to do the same for this loan. He even said he did it. But he didn\u2019t. I found out last year and have been trying to get him to do it since. \n\nI asked nicely and he said he wouldn\u2019t because it wasn\u2019t fair to put the debt only in his name and hurt his ability to finance (it wouldn\u2019t - he owns a million dollar business, he just bought a corvette. He travels every week for pleasure.) \n\nThe judge didn\u2019t even make him testify. Just me. It\u2019s a matter of how the language was written - despite the fact that it makes no sense to put in writing someone would do something that they already said they completed. \n\nI\u2019m beyond myself. I truly depressed from this. I have no recourse and I\u2019m the one being punished and harmed by him. The judge didn\u2019t even look at all the evidence. \n\nI have no faith in a justice system that defends the bully instead of the person being bullied. \n\nNote to anyone getting divorced. Make sure it\u2019s written in the decree/property split that any loan or debt that your ex is responsible for must be paid off or moved into an account or contract on solely their name within 60 days of the divorce. Even if it\u2019s already been done. \n\nThis is where my lawyer failed me. She thought the \u201chold harmless, indemnify, from liability\u201d would include making sure it wasn\u2019t harming me by not being in my credit. It apparently does not mean that. It actually just means that if he defaults I can pay money to sue him but it does nothing to protect me prior to him defaulting even if I am harmed by not being able to obtain personal finance as a result of this loan (even if current) because creditors count any debt on your credit - even if you have court paperwork showing someone else is responsible. \n\nCreditors don\u2019t have to honor a divorce decree.",

I feel so defeated. I don\u2019t understand how the judge did that.",

They read \u201cVictor will call bank to transfer loan solely into his name.\u201d \n\nThen the mediator sent a follow up email that I was copied on that said \u201cVictor did you call the bank and fully remove Donna from the account\u201d \n\nVictor replied with \u201cthis has been completed and I have paperwork showing it\u201d. \n\nI did not ask to see the paperwork as I thought the mediator did. I did not include to refinance or transfer the loan because I thought he already did. \n\nFast forward to when it was identified. I messaged Victor to ask about it and he said \u201cYour name is no where on the loan, I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s on your credit\u201d when I called the company they said all Victor did was remove my information and pay the bills but the original contract was in tact and I was liable and it would show on my credit until it was paid off \u2026 in 12 years \u2026 unless Victor chose to refinance. \n\nVictor said he won\u2019t. It\u2019s for no other reason than to make me financing things for myself difficult. Victor has the money in the bank to pay it out right. \n\nThe judge wouldn\u2019t even listen to the evidence or make Victor testify.",

If I only had my personal debt and this loan wasn\u2019t included, I would have been approved. The lender said that and it was in the evidence the judge refused to hear). \n\nThere\u2019s no other reason for him to not pay it or refinance it other than to harass me and limit me. His bank statements show he could even pay it outright if he wanted. The judge didn\u2019t care. I\u2019m so stunned.",

That \u201cassume\u201d the debt meant \u201cput only in his name\u201d which again, I thought he had done. \n\n3. That \u201chold harmless\u201d meant I was not to ever be impacted or harmed by the existence of this debt. \n\nApparently - assume and hold harmless does not mean that and I should have either verified he refinanced it or I should have included language about something that was already done needing to be done. \n\nSo the judge didn\u2019t change the order - the debt still belongs to my ex and my ex still has to pay it. What the judge did do is decline to acknowledge that I am being harmed and as a result that harm should be alleviated by forcing my ex to pay off the loan in full or refinance into his name alone. \n\nThe end result would be that instead of it appearing on BOTH our credit reports, it would only appear on my ex\u2019s and I would stop being harmed by its impact to my debt to income. \n\nThe judge refused to hear all the evidence and simply said that because it was not spelled out he had to refinance, and because my ex does pay the monthly payment, that the other harm being done to me doesn\u2019t matter and I should have included he needed to refinance (even though he said he did \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f) \n\nMake it make sense",

    "postText": "I recently hit a big milestone in my life, one that my family has always promised an expensive gift for. A few months ago I hinted at what I wanted (and by hint I mean I sent a link to exactly what I wanted to my parents). \n\nThe gift I wanted is quite expensive but something I can keep for a lifetime and I truly love and I think would be representative of how hard I\u2019ve worked towards this milestone. My parents also have quite an expendable income and it is something they can afford within their budget. I also have not asked or gotten any financial support or expensive gifts from them in many, many years. \n\nMy parents historically have not been great gift-givers. They never seem to understand my taste, style, or interest. Hence, why I sent them exactly what I wanted. \n\nWhat I didn\u2019t want to have happen was them to spend a lot of money on something that I won\u2019t like or won\u2019t use and then feel guilty for not liking it and making them feel bad for wasting money. And that\u2019s exactly what happened. My very well-intentioned father spent a lot of money on this gift (albeit less than the one I had asked for, which is not an issue). At the end of the day it is not something I like, does not match my style or taste, and I feel like it doesn\u2019t represent the meaningful milestone in my life as it will probably sit i it\u2019s box in my closet for years to come. To make matters worse, they had it personalized so I\u2019m doubtful that we will be able to return it. \n\nUghhhhhhh I feel like such a brat for being this upset over a present but I guess I really had my hopes up. I wish my parents hadn\u2019t spent that much money without consulting me first. In the case that the gift I had wanted was out of their budget, I wish they would have just said \u201chey that\u2019s not what we had budgeted to spend but here\u2019s a GC or cash to put towards it\u201d. \n\nI know my dad put a lot of thought, effort, and money into this gift but that doesn\u2019t make me hate the item any less. \n\nNow I get to have the conversation with them about whether or not it can be returned and try not to look like an ungrateful brat in the process.",

But If you really hate it that much I guess it\u2019ll be more of a waste of money if you don\u2019t use the gift. I\u2019ve disliked many gifts from family at first but never had the heart to tell them.",

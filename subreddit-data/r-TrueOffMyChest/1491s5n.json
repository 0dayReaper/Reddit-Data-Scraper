    "postText": "He is such a fucking asshole, an annoying, idiotic, rude person and he very clearly hates me and openly tries to irritate me and make me feel miserable. \n\nThe other people in my friend group definitely seem to like him more than they like me. This is my only group of friends and it\u2019s getting to the point where I just can\u2019t stand to be around this person. So now I feel like I just have to leave the group, and if that happens, I\u2019ll basically have no one. I\u2019ll just be trapped in my own world and all of the miserable shit that\u2019s happening in my personal life.",

There are really only a few options here, either he isn't an asshole, they are all assholes, or you are the asshole. Either way the solution is on you. \n\nAs you say, you cant control other people, so you need to talk to your friends or get new ones. I'm sure you will find the answer to who the asshole is in the process",

There is no objective trait that qualifies someone as being an \u201casshole\u201d beyond an individual\u2019s subjective human perception. I don\u2019t know where you got the idea that my goal was to find out who the \u201ctrue asshole\u201d was but I never said that \n\nBut yes my choice is to either stay and be miserable or leave and be miserable and alone. I\u2019m autistic with no knowledge of how to meet people and I live in rural nowhere village so it\u2019s basically impossible for me to find new friends",

Friends or no friends has no bearing on that.\n\nThere are lots of autistic people out there with friends so don't hide behind that. I'm sure you can find friends if you stop victimizing yourself and try to be a good friend",

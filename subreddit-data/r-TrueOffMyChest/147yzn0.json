    "postText": "I don't eat, I only sleep to escape my thoughts for a short period of time, I almost always feel like I have the flu and I'm just not taking care of myself. I've tried so hard to break the cycle but I can't. The people around me that I care about are giving up on me just as much as I'm giving up on myself. I can't go an hour alone without losing my mind and if I keep this up I know I'll find myself in a mental hospital especially due to the excessive SH. I'm still young and I feel like I'm throwing all my potential out the window. I just needed to get this out and if you're reading this (or even not) I appreciate you so much. &lt;3",

I hope you find that person that believes in you and can pull you out of this situation. Sometimes it takes so much to progress but in the end it\u2019s the tiny accomplishments that build value. I\u2019m not the most successful or by all means doing well but I am definitely a good shoulder to lean on if you need to talk.",

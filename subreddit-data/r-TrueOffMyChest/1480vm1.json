    "postText": "Trigger warning.\n\nI feel so stupid. I usually Uber or Lyft but I live in a major US city with a lot of cabs. I left a festival to a line of at least ten cabs and I asked a few of the drivers for a ride and they said they had riders, but one man in a car in the cab line asked me where I was going, told me the fare and I got in. Note: it was not a cab, but I wasn\u2019t totally thrown off as sometimes Ubers ride  off the books.\n\nAbout 20 minutes into our ride I realized that things were not right and we were not near where I should be. I did drink that day and was very tired. He told me there was an issue with the back of the car and he asked me if I could move to the front seat.\n\nI again didn\u2019t totally think this was a red flag until I did realize when I pulled up maps that we were not on the way to my destination so I pulled up the maps and told him where he needed to go and he did listen.\n\nWhen we got about 1 mi away from my destination he started grabbing my breasts, kissing me and telling me I needed to touch him. He pulled out his genitals, forced my hands and face to touch him, groped my breasts while I begged him to stop and stop the car to let me out. I opened the car door, screaming for help and I wanted to jump out but he pulled my hair, my long earrings, my breasts. He refused to stop the car. My cell phone and shoe fell out of the car.\n\nI thought I was going to die. I am still so shaken up from this. I just can\u2019t imagine what would have happened if I didn\u2019t finally get out of the car, but as he neared a stop sign I did jump out and ran down the street with one shoe on, crying, until I finally found a couple who called the police.\n\nHe obviously wasn\u2019t a cab driver. I don\u2019t know the model or make of the car or license plate. I just feel so stupid as a city girl who cabs all the time, I\u2019m just devastated and ashamed.\n\nTLDR: got abducted and assaulted by a man pretending to be a cab driver.",

The assailants/rapists aren't all idiots, and they know ways to seem safe or get access.\n\nWhen I was 14, I was sexually assaulted by a stranger in broad daylight in a city park in a \"safe\" neighborhood. I was aware, but there was no escape. I won't go into details, but I was sure he was going to kill me. I had panic attacks for decades because of this.\n\nOne of the very few people I late confided in was my (now ex-) husband. He said I'd probably looked nervous, and that's why this guy decided to attack me. I knew that wasn't true, as I'd deliberately acted casual and confident, but the pain of getting told that I was to blame for the horrifying actions of my assailant was intense. \n\nThis was not OP's fault in any way.",

This is a discussion board after all! \n\nAlso the comment about it being normal is, in this world, true. It is normal that on the distribution of all events (good and bad) people get murdered, robbed, assaulted, etc. I\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s too hard for you to consider, but it\u2019s true.

Should we all just stop showering or could it be that these people were just unlucky? \n\nIn OP's case, the driver were portraying himself as a professional driver by waiting in a line of taxis for an unsuspecting victim. You can be aware of all the dangers in the world and actively take precautions to protect yourself from them and all it takes is a second of absent mindedness for you to be unlucky enough to get into a dangerous situation. And nobody can be on high alert all the time. That's why people get upset when people say things like you said, because it DOES put some responsibility on OP and that's really not fair. \n\nAnd I mean. You can absolutely get into shark infested waters without being attacked. It's actually more uncommon for sharks to actually attack humans than letting them be (in the US 12 people died due to shark attacks during the 30 year period from 1970-2000. As stated above, taking a shower is more dangerous). Is it a risk? Sure, but just waking up in the morning is dangerous if you want to use that logic.",

Being in a city with so many cars and cabs it can be overwhelming it could of happened to anyone.  \n\nThe one good thing about living in a city though is that there is normally cameras everywhere. Since a couple called the police they might be able to find CCTV.\n\nAs someone who has been SAd by 9 different people in various ways i have only reported one other people have came forward and he was supposed to of been arrested last week. I didnt report the others because it happened during childhood or when i was older. i felt so ashamed and didnt realise what it was until someone told me otherwise.\n\nBe sure to confide in someone. Family, friends, even a help line would be willing to here you vent. Or if you have a therapist etc then talk to them. There is so many resources that can help you. Write down on paper when your feeling up to it. Everything that happened that night. Step by step. Detail everything you can remember. It may help in the future. \n\nSome people say that Time will heal everything. It doesnt it just teaches you on how to live with the pain. The first step to healing is to talk about it to someone in your support system and accept that it werent your fault. \n\nYou managed to get away. I have never been able to do that. You are so brave and strong for managing to do it. You can get through this lovely\n \nIf you need anything, anything at all just ask ill be happy to answer some questions.",

The blame is on that creep who took advantage of you, not you. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard, I can somewhat relate. A few years ago, I let a \u201cfriend\u201d crash with me and sleep in my bed. I thought it was safe because we\u2019d slept in the same room before. I woke up to him assaulting me. He stopped when he thought I woke up and started again when I was still and he thought I was asleep. I blame myself for being stupid and trusting him and not protecting myself. I try not to, but I still do. Now I just try to remind myself that the fault lies with him for being a shitty person. Please try to remember the same for yourself. It\u2019s not your fault that someone else is shitty and took advantage of you.",

    "postText": "I don't know why in gods good name my mom thought I would be the one to come to. We don't get along. I went to live with dad at 16 because she told me she hated me and kicked me out. My older brother, the golden child, I know for a fact has a spare bedroom she could sleep in now that she's losing the house.\n\nMy moms situation is entirely her own fault as well, which makes this all the more annoying. She and my stepdad bought a 7-bed room house 10 years ago, right after she left her job of 20 years to work at some stupid start-up that was out of business only 3 years later. My stepdad spent the last years of his miserable life bed-bound because he ignored every doctor telling him to stop shoving his face full of food at every waking moment of the day. So, he died 500 pounds and in misery. I was more than fine with this by the way. Well, when he died early this year it pretty much drained the last of the money my moron of a mother had remaining, and now the banks taking the house back. \n\nSo, she shows up at my door for some reason. After mistreating me since I was a kid, and ignoring me unless she wanted something since she married that thankfully dead land whale. She had the nerve to ask to live with me! It's only me and my husband in our 2 bedroom house sure. But that spare bedroom is his office, the basements my art studio, and the couch in front of the fireplace is for our lovely cats. There is no room for the wicked hag anywhere in this house. But, I knew this opportunity would never come again. So.....\n\nI told her she could live with us, if, and only if she decided to follow the house rules.\n\n\\&gt; All electronics were to be turned off by 6 pm. If she was caught with any after that they would be taken away and sold at the next yard sale.\n\n\\&gt; Bedtime was 7:30, if I caught her up I would take away all of her clothing for the week. \n\n\\&gt; She may only shower for 5 minutes, once every three days\n\n\\&gt; All chores must be done the moment she wakes up. If I roll out of bed and they are not she will not be getting meals for the day.\n\n\\&gt; She must make sure she is alert at all times, if I and hubby need something done, IT IS TO BE DONE AT THAT MOMENT, or else she will lose her bedding privileges for the night.  \n\n\\&gt; She will be in charge of cooking one meal each day, that I choose, if it is not made to my liking she will not be allowed to join us and instead will eat the cheapest frozen meal available. \n\n\\&gt; I will be reading all her mail, text messages, and emails. I will give her the ones I deem acceptable communication under my roof. \n\n\\&gt; Her car will be my own personal travel car, she will also drive me where ever I want. She will still have to pay for gas.\n\nAnd, last but not least.\n\n\\&gt; If at any point she displeases me, I will be calling my brother up to pick her up from a nearby gas station. I will get to choose what she takes to put in a torn-up backpack before dropping her off without looking back. \n\nShe called me a monster, told me these conditions were inhuman, and asked if I was insane. These were the exact conditions I lived under for years as a teenager. The exact conditions she tormented me with for years until she finally let me go live with the one parent that loved me. And these would be the conditions she would suffer under if she dared to ask me to home her worthless, joysucking soul.\n\nI don't know where she went after she stormed out of my house. My brother called me and told me I have \"the biggest balls in the family\" for the stunt I pulled. From the sounds of it though, none of the spawn want the brood mother to live with them. \n\nI hope she finds a nice park bench to stay on.",

I am so sorry you had to suffer through that as a teenager but that must have felt absolutely incredible and empowering to be able to shove those inhuman conditions back down her throat.\n\nIt sounds like she thought she didn't have a daughter but rather a slave.\n\nI hope she rots while you and your husband and cats enjoy a nice relaxing evening knowing that you will never be subjected to those conditions again.",

Brings me along and even had me help with their practices. Wants to watch a movie? Finds one he knows he\u2019ll like, but that I can enjoy too, with a solid message. The list goes on.

Our mother was rude, unappreciative, expected meals always cooked for her, never cleaned up after herself, left bowls and coffee cups to mold and rot in her bedroom like a teen, refused to do chores, \"\"forgot\"\" to set aside money for household bills, out to all hours of the night visiting anyone and everyone during the pandemic (my sister's husband was immune compromised). The last straw for my sister was when my mother brought a bag of trail mix with peanuts into the house (sister's husband was SEVERELY allergic and this was common knowledge), tried to hide it, lied about it when caught, then tried to say it wasn't a big deal and they shouldn't be upset.\n\nMy aunt and uncle (mother's sister and brother in law) took her in next. She lasted 4, maybe 5 months there. Same shit as she pulled with my sister more or less, on top of refusing to get a job (my aunt and uncle let her live with them, against their lease, rent free! So she could save money). \n\nMy SO and I took her in after that. We live in a TINY apartment with our toddler. We are financially well, but rent is stupid expensive in our area. It was supposed to be temporary, she'd sleep in our living room and we just wouldn't have a living room. Well that wasn't good enough, she wanted a bedroom. She insisted on sharing the toddler's room. She then took a night job, meaning she slept off hours from the rest of us. My SO was uncomfortable putting our son to bed as my mother would be in there sleeping (totally understandable), so it fell to me most times. Her sleep apnea machine would wake the toddler. Her (loud and several) alarms would wake the toddler. Did I mention her chihuahua slept in there with her too? The dog barking would wake the toddler. Toddler got no sleep. SO and I got no sleep. Once, my SO went in to soothe the babe back to bed, but quickly came out of the bedroom stating my mother had PINCHED his BUTT while he was leaning over the crib. \n\nShe also constantly dropped her pills on the floor, and it terrified the crap out of me that our son might find and eat one. Seriously, we found a couple stuck under door jams, under furniture, etc even two months after she left. Terrible.\n\nSo when I learned what she'd done, that was my final staw. Out. Now. Never come back, never text, never call. Come get your shit or it goes to the dump, I. Do. Not. Care. She is the most thoughtless human I have ever met. 1 year no contact on October 22nd I believe? Most peaceful time of my life to date.",

I just said \"well that was your choice\"  but I should have just said \"he didn't respect you, why did you respect him?\" or something along those lines.\n\nBeing a parent doesn't automatically entitle you to care from your kids when you're old and gray.

It took me a long time to realize that I don't have to base my entire identity around my abuse. It was a thing that happened long ago, and every day that I continue living is another day between now, and that time. I've had revenge fantasies sure, but I almost always feel guilty after because frankly, I don't want to hurt anyone. \n\nAll that being said, this approach doesn't work for everyone. Some people can't or won't let go, rightly so. And if getting even with your abuser will let you live a happier life, I say by all means give them what they deserve.",

            "comment": "I am so proud of you!!\n\nMy(51) severely mentally ill but untreated, psycho bitch mother(81) was a controlling witch too. Old age &amp; physical infirmity has slowed her to a crawl. \n\nSome rather memorable shit she pulled was saying to me, when I was about 13 &amp; told her my, now deceased, dad had drilled pinholes in the bathroom door &amp; had been peeking at me when I was bathing, to \"stop giving him something to look at.\" He'd already driven my older sister away with his peeping. So naturally, when I was date raped at 15 I didn't tell her, she still doesn't know. Nor does she know about the 2nd time I was raped.\n\nAbout 2 years ago younger(46) sister confided in me that older(58) sister's 1st husband ((33)nephew's dad) had molested her when she was 14 &amp; when she told mom, unsurprisingly, she didn't believe her. \n\nFast forward 15 years later &amp; I stupidly had forgiven mother &amp; invited her to my wedding but, she &amp; younger sister flaked &amp; didn't show up because I got upset about them keeping the severity of sister's trichotrillomania a secret from me so that I could've gotten her a nice wig in my city. I couldn't find anything decent in my small hometown so I had to tell sister she couldn't be my bridesmaid. \n\nFast forward again several years &amp; I'd stupidly forgiven them again, &amp; mom threatened on facebook that if she could afford it she'd hire a hitman to kill me. That was due to her &amp; younger sister, who's never left home, being animal hoarders &amp; when husband &amp; I helped clean up her property &amp; make repairs to the house (my grandparent's home mom inherited), I discovered she'd acquired yet another puppy after she'd agreed no more.\n\nI tried &amp; tried to get her to give me the puppy. I finally told her that since husband &amp; I had put time, money &amp; physical work into her home she could repay me with the puppy &amp; that I expected her to give me puppy when I stopped by on our way out of town the next day. She called the cops &amp; told them I'd been threatening her.\n\nWell, when the cops were at her home they of course noticed the numerous dogs &amp; cats she had &amp; they reported her &amp; the city forced her to relinqiush all but 4 animals. Idk how many animals in all but I'd say around 2 dozen or more. She had many cats in the garage that she kept locked so I really don't know. Anyway, it was all my fault &amp; I deserved to die according to mom &amp; younger sister. \n\nThere's sooooo much more I could share abt mom &amp; sisters &amp; a nephew but, the aforementioned situations are the ones that have stayed with me. Many people are very likely asking why in hell would I have anything to do with such people &amp; forgive them so many atrocious things? It's hard to explain, except that hope dies hard &amp; I've rationalized their behavior because they all, mom,  sisters, nephew have untreated mental illness &amp; addiction problems so I forgave them far too many times up until about 2 years ago when I went NC with my sisters &amp; nephew &amp; currently only message with my mom, roughly once a week. \n\nThe conversations are very superficial because she's never really been able to handle anything emotionally heavy. I've finally accepted this is the way these people are &amp; they'll not be changing. I've repetedly offered to pay for in-house rehab for both sisters &amp; therapy for all but they've repeatedly refused. I've done all I can do. My tank is empty when it comes to them. I've not seen mom &amp; sisters in 10 years. Nephew was living with husband &amp; I for several years while got his degree but, he blew up the relationship recently so we're now NC with him too.\n\nI'm mentally, emotionally &amp; physically drained due to 20+ years of chronic pain &amp; back issues &amp; I no longer give a crap about them. Their crap is theirs to live with. I'm now focused on my own life &amp; marriage that I long neglected due to worrying about &amp; attempting to help them. I wish them no ill will or harm, I simply no longer have no place for them in my life. It's taken me 40+ years to truly break free from my family which has suffered mental health &amp; addiction issues for generations. I broke the cycle &amp; even though it took decadeds I'm ok with it all because I'm finally, after years of self work &amp; therapy, truly free from their dark cloud. \n\nI hope this latest situation with you mother hasn't caused you too much upset &amp; that you can soon fimd your peace again. All the best to you.",

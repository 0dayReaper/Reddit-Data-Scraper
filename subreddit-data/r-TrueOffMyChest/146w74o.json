    "postText": "So me (25yo M) and my girlfriend (24yoF) have been dating for about 3 years and things in the bedroom have slowly started to almost come to a halt. To give some backstory, I was a virgin until I was 23 and never dated anyone before my girlfriend. I was very self conscious about my body and it scared me away from any sexual acts. But she took my virginity only a week into knowing her existence and we fell in love pretty quick. Her sex life on the other hand has been much more exciting than mine. She had what people call a \u201choe phase\u201d, when she turned 18 and had sex with tons and tons of people, even going to sex clubs ect ect. In the beginning of our relationship she was the one asking for sex and there were times I\u2019d have to say no because I wasn\u2019t feeling confident yet. But as time went on, I lost weight, I gained confidence and my sex drive skyrocketed. But now her sex drive is almost non existent. She tells me she actually hates having sex, not because I\u2019m bad at it but just because she doesn\u2019t enjoy it. The only times we have sex usually is when she wants to orgasm. To which I have to do a little routine for her which is basically just lay there while she gets off. And then I have to finish quick afterwards. I should feel lucky enough to have that at all but it\u2019s not what I think sex should be. Instead she does things to make me sexually aroused on purpose and then acts surprised and upset when I try to make a move. Today it\u2019s been almost 2 weeks since we last had sex. And by sex I mean I did the thing she likes to make her orgasm. But today I decided to tell her how I feel and said I\u2019m not happy and that I\u2019d like to talk about our sex life. She proceeded to get depressed and tell me that it\u2019s sad that I care about sex so much. I genuinely love her so no, breaking up isn\u2019t really in my book of ideas but I really don\u2019t know what to do. Thoughts?",

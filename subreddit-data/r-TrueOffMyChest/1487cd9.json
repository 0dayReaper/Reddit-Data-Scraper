Or the room that you spent thousands of hours in sleeping and relaxing.  Or the familiar streets you used to take to work?  Or the kitchen where you cooked thousands of meals and just existed? \n\nI'm not into spirits or energy or anything, but you have to admit when you've put so much time of your life in a place, it's sad to leave it, at least it is for me.  \n\nYet, there are people who just pack up and leave no problem.",

So much so that when I was growing up I only used to leave my furniture in one place for like 3-6 months before moving everything around.  \n\nI used to LOVE moving because it was always something new when I did.  Sometimes it was worse but you learn to live with worse until your lease runs out and you can jump to some place hopefully better.  Sucks when even that gets worse.\n\nNew is filled with new possibilities, new adventures, new experiences.  It can be HUGELY inspiring and pump you full of energy.\n\nFor some reason tho, as I got older, I decided enough of that crap and now I've been in the same place for a long ass time.",

Granted I\u2019m disabled and my moms disabled so I\u2019ve never really been able to work near enough to afford living on my own. Especially with how expensive it is where I am. I can\u2019t wait to someday leave this home and have a new one. It\u2019s old and falling apart. But at the same time, the idea of leaving it breaks my heart and my moms. My mom is into spirits and energy. But we\u2019ve put all of our lives into this home. My parents life before me, my childhood years, the wall of my growth chart, all the hurricanes we\u2019ve survived here, all the pets we\u2019ve had here and the memories this home holds is unreal. The neighborhood park I\u2019ve grown up in all my life that\u2019s just down the road. I\u2019ve had different friends live here, ex boyfriends and my fianc\u00e9. This house holds more memories then my brain could ever remember. The room I\u2019ve spent everyday of my life sleeping in. I mean hell my rooms so small it\u2019s only been redone once because it\u2019s hard to move stuff around to redo it. I can\u2019t change up my room by moving stuff because it won\u2019t fit any other way. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever known. \n\nI\u2019ve always preferred sleepovers at my own home over others because I didn\u2019t feel comfortable enough in others homes to fall asleep. Only two friends houses have I ever actually slept at. I worry if/when I finally pack up and move, I won\u2019t be able to sleep. It won\u2019t feel like home. It\u2019ll be a new home but I get anxious even thinking of leaving even though I also can\u2019t wait to leave this poor old home. I see so many people just pack up and leave and I\u2019m just wondering how.\n\nEdit: changed a word.",

This has played a large factor in the decision making process on whether or not I would stay in to go for retirement.\n\nI see each move as an opportunity to explore and have adventures, to see places that I would otherwise probably never get the opportunity to go. There are challenges with each station, but so many benefits that I cannot count from (hopefully) life-long friends, support networks, the right people who were put in our lives at the right moment we needed them, and so many opportunities for growth and adventure.\n\nTrust me, I do want to settle down, one day, but I'll take the adventure where I can get it.\n\nAs long as the adventure doesn't lead back to California.

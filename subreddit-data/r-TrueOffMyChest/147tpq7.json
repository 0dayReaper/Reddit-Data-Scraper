My dad on the other hand, finds being called by his first name, disrespectful, so I still call him dad.\n\nYou not alone.",

Sometimes just to annoy her a bit. My parents are getting older and it breaks my heart to even think that someday I\u2019ll say it and I won\u2019t hear her reply to me.",

But if you're just saying \"Hey\" to start a convo, it's kinda rude. Like, you have a name and it would be both rude and confusing if someone just said \"Hey, do you have X thing ready?\" and just expected you to be the one who responded.",

They're people with thoughts and feelings and they have a relationship to you. Not using a real identifier can easily be seen as you viewing them as just a thing you have to interact with from time to time.\nBut more importantly, it's really confusing.\n\nExample:\n\"Hey, I was thinking about the movie and how it did the thing and was really cool. Are you even listening to me?\"\n*Pulls out ear buds* \"Wait, were you talking to me?\"\n\nLike, just use a name to make things clear. Definitely weird and innefficient to live life as if names and identifiers are superfluous to conversation.",

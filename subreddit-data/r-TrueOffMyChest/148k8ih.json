If it makes any sense? :) \n\nCompromising only happens when something\u2019s outweighs the other so you tend to meet halfway..? \n\nBut why would you even have to be in a situation where you need to compromise if in the first place you both know where you stand and you both respect it??\n\nI am just blabbering, good point tho :)",

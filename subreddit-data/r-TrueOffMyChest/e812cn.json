She is a piece of shit.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t know, she KILLED someone because she was texting and driving, and then SUED the family of the victim saying they didn\u2019t deserve any compensation, and then NEVER EVEN APOLOGISED! \n\nThen this piece of shit wins TIMES WOMAN OF THE YEAR?! \n\nI normally think white privilege is a bullshit concept, but she is a stark example of it.

So yeah, no, on the people claiming that if you have any issue with her whatsoever, you must be transphobic. Trans people are quite possibly her biggest critics.\n\nI agree with you, she's a walking example of privilege.",

However an ASShole is sometimes filled with shit, which is disgusting, but either way, the shit isn't in the hole for long. In that sense, you are saying that this person exists as an empty hole which is sometimes filled with shit, but even the shit doesn't want to hang around for long.\n\nSo the inslut is extremely fitting in this situation.",

She\u2019s always been the most annoying part of the show - including when Scott was drunk and cheating on Kourtney and being an overall douche.\n\nThe only thing I can appreciate about Caitlyn is that before this whole thing, my sisters told me that they wouldn\u2019t call our acquaintance who is FTM by his preferred name. After this, they each made efforts to call people by their preferred names. I\u2019d like to think that this is also just growth with my sisters, but it was very abruptly after the news about Caitlyn and her talking about it.\n\nWe all agree now that\u2019s she\u2019s pretty awful, though. And I didn\u2019t even know about the DUI thing.",

I don't like my parts, but all that plus major surgery that may turn out horrible is not a worthy investment. I'll stick with a good ol' fashioned orchiectomy, thank you very much.\n\nSo, yeah, fuck Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nAlso she supports Trump, so there's that.",

I hear phalloplasties are a bit harder, simply because you can't create erectile tissue out of nothing, but vaginoplasties are getting pretty good. The one thing we're missing is self-lubrication, but that's what lube is for. I was on the fence a bit because people kept talking about how it's not the same, but I'm super happy I was able to have it done. Wouldn't go back for anything!",

The Kardashians have turned themselves into products: Their appearance, their livestyles, their relationships\u2026 \n\nThey're like Barbies. Each one has a different style to appeal to lots of audiences of different ages and interests (Kris is the \"momager\", Kim is the fashionable one, Khloe is the sporty and tough one, Kourtney is the healthy one, Kendall is the cool model one, Kylie is the young entrepeneur one) . Through their show, they turn every situation in their personal lives into a product, literally reducing what would normally be human events (heartbreaks, friendships, celebrations, grieving\u2026) into episodes of a soap opera. They not only edit and adorn everything, they carefully regulate how much of it they'll share so you're always eager to find out what happens next. \n\nThis means everything is glamorous and entertaining, even the usually boring, monotone and tedious aspects of life (they delete/adorn that in post). Everything looks cool, comfortable, expensive, glamorous, dramatic, intense\u2026\n\nThey're easy to digest, they don't require any analysis or invite to reflection. They just look good. \n\nAnd they've made sure you can find them everywhere, while behaving like exclusive content. \n\nThey don't ever need to worry, no matter what they will always look good, they will never face real struggle.\n\nEach of them has their own merch (make up lines, clothing lines, diet pills\u2026). \n\nThey handle their lives as if they were characters in their own fanfiction story, but the magic is\u2026 they're real people. You can daydream you're one of them, or that you're their friend and so become part of that fantasy world.\n\nAnd consuming all the content they offer makes you feel closer to that fantasy, like you're part of that life, but you'll always need more (cause they'll always want you to need more). So you watch every episode, you read every post, you see every picture, you buy every product\u2026 just so you can feel, even if for a second, that you belong in that perfect universe (or at least, to make others think so). You think if others see you wearing the K product, they'll see in you all the amazing traits you see in the K family, and that is adictive.\n\nIt's like the people in any fandom, who will watch and share all the content their favorite characters show up in,  but cause these people are real there's some sort of \"you could be here too\" thing going on underneath. And we all know how powerful that is as a marketing technique.\n\nSo, TL;DR: They've turned themselves into products.",

For some but not all trans people- depending upon how strong a self-identify they were able to develop- there's the you you've had to piece together to satisfy people (your \"deadname,\" to many trans people) and then there's You. Coming out of the closet entails more than just announcing what you are because there are a lot of interests and personality traits you've likely suppressed in being closeted, so it would take a while to sort of \"discover\" yourself in adulthood, not dissimilar from what most people go through in their teens. This, to an extent, is some of the immaturity we see in LGBTQ persons whom the media swallows whole when some video goes viral: there are people who, for the first time, are really trying to get a grasp of who they really are as opposed to whatever personality they presented with to try blending in a bit. Doesnt excuse someone being an absolute ass but it's a part of someone figuring out how they really want to look and act and carry themselves, including standing up for themselves and the limits of that before you're being an ass, yourself.\n\nIt ain't easy. Some people conceptualize it this way.",

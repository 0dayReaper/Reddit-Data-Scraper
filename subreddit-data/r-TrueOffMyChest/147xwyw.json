    "postText": "I know that this problem is nowhere near as big as a lot of people\u2019s on this sub, but idk what else to do.\nI am a teenager that has just started summer about a week ago, and i feel like i am not doing anything with the time that i have. I played a good amount of sports throughout the school year and i didn\u2019t really hate any of the them but i didn\u2019t really like them either, i wanted them to be over as soon as possible. Idk how to feel about not enjoying sports, it\u2019s not like i can\u2019t do them, i did decently good in the sports that i did do, i just did not enjoy doing them. I feel like I\u2019m letting people down (especially my parents) by not doing sports, i feel like I\u2019m making them think I\u2019m lazy. Im not sure if i just need to suck it up and do sports despite rather be doing something else? The stuff i do enjoy doing arnt really something to replace sports. This doesn\u2019t just apply to sports too, sports is just the easiest to describe and think about. I do have a job but i only work twice a week at most so that can\u2019t just replace sports. I don\u2019t know what to do to use my time wisely, i feel lazy for not wanting to do stuff i don\u2019t want to do. I wish i could have something i could do where i can improve on myself and my talents and that i genuinely enjoy doing. Is that too much to expect? Am i really just being extremely lazy? I have no idea. I know that if i start sports or anything else there will be no getting out of it, unless if i could find something to replace it, and if i don\u2019t like that then i am 100% screwed. I really don\u2019t want to waste my summer by doing nothing but i also don\u2019t want to spend my entire summer doing stuff i don\u2019t like just to feel like i did something. Could i please have some help? Any kind of advice would help please.",

    "postText": "hi. i apologize if i make any mistakes, english isn't my first language.\r  \n\r  \nthese past few months were confusing. i've been trying to trace the origins of my torment, which led me to question the reasons of my self-hatred and how i can fix that. i already figured a lot of the reasons, but one reason in particular --one i tried to keep a secret-- keeps resurfacing even if it's \"old\" now. that reason is my sister.\r  \n\r  \nmy (18f) sister (25f) is the most wonderful person i know. i could write about how much i love her in thousands of ways and it still wouldn't be enough. our bond can't be explained.\r  \n\r  \nbut our relationship wasn't always like this. it's difficult to explain, like any bond between siblings, i guess. but i have to admit it, she was mean to me. i remember her rejecting me, yelling at me, always reminding me how awful, horrible, and insufferable i was as a kid. i remember her never wanting to hang out with me and my younger brother (14m). i remember the venom in her voice and the resentment in her eyes when she would look at me and describe to me all the flaws i possessed. it was everything i was to her.\r  \n\r  \ni never did anything about that. i let her be. in a way, i could see where it was coming from. she always had responsibilities piled up on her, she was always expected to behave perfectly. she never really had a childhood, so i guess her \"teenage angst\" happened later than normal. she was young. i never blamed it on her, and i could never resent her for it. in a way, i thought i deserved it. i thought perhaps that's what i got for being such a shitty sibling. i don't know. it's strange. i was never like her. maybe she hated me for it. i don't know. in the end i just kept quiet about all the things she said to me and didn't really think much of it.\r  \n\r  \ntime went on and she changed. our relationship bloomed into what it is today. but i'm so confused. before, when the topic of my childhood came up, she would describe this horrible kid, who left nothing but misfortune in her wake. now, when i joke about it, about how horrible i was, she frowns and asks me why i would think that. \"it's not true\", she says, and i just don't understand.\r  \n\r  \nbut now i do understand, and i know it's partly my fault. it's because i've never brought this topic up. i've never told her how mean she was, and how the wounds, despite being old and unseen, still run deep inside me. frankly, i just didn't want her to feel the way i felt. i know she isn't as resilient as i am when it comes to those things, and i know she would never forgive herself if she knew how she truly behaved with me before. as i said, she was young. but i was young too. i was a kid.\r  \n\r  \nso now, sometimes, when she compliments me, i unconsciously think it's a lie, because the only things i can hear are the insults she spat at me years ago. she doesn't understand why i think i'm horrible, when she was one of the first to tell me so.\r  \n\r  \ni still don't know how to tell her properly. but i think it needs to be said, for my sake and for hers. if i want to detach myself from those suffocating thoughts, if i want to preserve our relationship and maybe strengthen it in the process, then i need to take that step. i just hope i'm doing the right thing.\r  \n\r  \nwriting this helped me sort out my thoughts. now i just need to say them out loud to her.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

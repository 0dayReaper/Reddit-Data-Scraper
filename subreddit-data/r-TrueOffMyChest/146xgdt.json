I have always wanted to have one since I was a child but I wasn\u2019t fortunate enough to have one, now that I am an adult I want to buy one because I have my own money now but I\u2019m scared of what people might think of me for being something like this. I want to buy something I haven\u2019t had ever and play with it a little tbh but I don\u2019t know if I should since I am an adult, thoughts?",

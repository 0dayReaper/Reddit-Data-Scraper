    "postText": "Sorry in advance if I have bad English, English is not my first language, but I am trying to improve. I (18f) have a best friend, we can call her Kayla (fake name). Kayla (19f) has been my best friend since we were 5. I moved and she was my first friend. We have been very close since then. Recently she has been leaving me a lot, or changing plans at the last minute. I will text her and ask her to come over, and she will agree. Sometimes she say she will be over soon, and then just never come over because she went somewhere else, or she just doesn\u2019t come. Sometimes she comes over, but she will leave after maybe an hour. She will say she has to eat even though I cook for her, or she say she will be right back. Then I will be on snap chat and she is driving with other people and hanging out somewhere else. She will be gone for weeks some times. We used to see each other every day and now I do not see her at all. And she does not talk to me about things any more. She post things and she sends videos and she is so different around them. Her personality flips as soon as they\u2019re around. She used to tell me everything that happened in her life, and now she says almost nothing. She still call me her best friend, but I don\u2019t feel like I am. It feels like she outgrew our friendship.",

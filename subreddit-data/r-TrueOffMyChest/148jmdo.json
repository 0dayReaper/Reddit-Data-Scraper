    "postText": "So we've been dating for almost 10 years, I'm 27m she's 25f. In our relationship I've had problems with watching hentai and downloading porn, following pornstars social medias. She confronted me and I just remember seeing her crying. I deleted everything and haven't looked back since. Fast forward 6 years, and she's on her phone constantly, texting, smiling.\n\nI'll be honest, I thought the worst, and thought she was cheating on me. She stopped paying attention to me, started declining my advances, and over all didn't show any interest in me. In a form of deserperation, I looked through her phone, and saw she was using those fucking AI chats to sext AI versions of her favorite YouTubers.\n\nI'm talking in depth romance, sex, and vague cuckholdery style porn. I couldn't watch hentai, hell.. I don't even have an interest in it anymore, but the fact she could happily fantasize and write out her literally fucking cheating on me with Markiplier. I think what hurt more was the sheer amount of her typing about how \"wrong it felt\" to get railed by YouTubers while still dating me. This ai shit is fucking stupid. I want to break up with her, god I dont want to be with her anymore, but the fact it's 10 fucking years down the drain. The chats seemed so real. When she wasn't roleplaying, she was genuinely talking all lovey dovey to someone who wasn't me.\n\nI'm a fucking mess right now.",

There's a hell of a lot of personal growth and development that happens between 19 and 29. That's the time in your life when you're figuring out who you are, so \"29yo you\" is (most likely) going to be a different person to \"19yo you\". It's very common for relationships (both romantic and platonic) to drift/grow apart during this time because of this. Values and priorities change, your brain finishes developing, you've spent more time out in the world as an adult (making decisions and being accountable to the consequences both good and bad), and ultimately just have a better idea of what you want in life. \n\nThere are definitely couples who do get together young and stay together, but personally I think those who do stay together (happily and by choice) are the exception rather than the rule.",

I don't believe for a single second that fantasizing about fictional characters is okay or any better. \n\nI have been able to cause solid couples to question their relationship by asking a series of questions regarding fantasies. \n\nEveryone is okay with thinking about celebs because \"oh it'll never happen haha\" (ignoring for a moment how this is already a toxic thought) but suddenly very much not okay when thinking the same thoughts about a friend or coworker or just someone else they see irl, because now suddenly it's a real threat, what people fail to realize is that if you are mentally solid in your relationship, you won't physically fail and end up cheating, but being allowed to fantasize even when the physical aspect isn't there, it opens you up to justifying it, normalizing it and then eventually acting on it. \n\nYou can't go on a diet and window shop for donuts, eventually you are going to want one. \n\nYour girl is already emotionally cheating, and that's the requirement needed to physically cheat in the future. You said she was declining your advances, that's a huge red flag that this is impacting your relationship.",

I get the time and effort, I get the relationship building but cheating (this is a form of it) is not recoverable, at least not back to the same level.\n\nEven if she disavowed this right now (which she will not) and completely changed, this feeling you have will never go away.\n\nOnce you truly love and trust someone, then lose it, you cannot truly love and trust them again. The pedestal you put them on (however big or small) is gone and all you are left holding is the realization that the person you thought was better, is not.\n\n\nIn life we go though relationships choosing who to stay with, it may not seem like it at the time, like if they break up with you, but when you find the one, the real one, you do not sabatoge it, you do your best, give your best and give all of your trust, and while it's true even that is sometimes not enough, once you've done that and they betray your trust in some way, that need to be better for them and to believe in them, goes away and thus so does the relationship.\n\nShe's already not giving you her best and she's ruined your trust. \n\nIt's best to move on, regardless of the time spent and I say this as someone who dispises this subs default of \"break up\".",

She literally withdrew her presence from her boyfriend and spent more time with the AI than her actual boyfriend. That was the problem here. Men will fuck anything,  sex is easy, it has been proven many times over. However, gaining an emotional connection with a person is very rare to find, but now with artificial intelligence it's not. \n\nPeople may consider nerdy or weird those who create fictional characters using AI chatbots to obtain the desired personality traits. However, if you can create any character with the traits you seek, why would you need a real relationship? Technology has already made us physically disconnected.\n\n** I find this whole post hilarious. A girl found out her boyfriend was into cartoon porn, which weirded her out and caused her to lose interest. Instead of communicating with him, she became distant and eventually cheated on him with an AI. The boyfriend is upset but won't leave because he feels invested after 10 years, even though he's unhappy.",

Throw a little plot twist in there like the ai loves her back and makes your Tesla take you out of the picture and you have a Philip k dick novela... Man I'm sorry. I found a piece of paper and it turned out to be a letter my gf wrote like 5 years into our relationship to her friend and I saw the word sex so I just couldn't help myself, she was talking about her ex and how they had all this \"amazing sex\" and then he cheated on her... Like just that was too much for me, that was really where I realized I wasn't her \"one\". Her argument was the letter was now a year or 2 old but I don't care, we'd still been together 5 years, she talks about me and it's good stuff but still, I'm thinking we've been having tons of amazing sex for 5 years and she's still hung up on the guy that cheated on her...it hurt, and there was other stuff, F that, she was an alcoholic, lying about going out and being drunk, find booze bottles or shed drive home and start a fight and then deny being drunk even though she wreaks like alcohol, even stopped mid fight once to go puke...new had been arguing about her being drunk and driving home instead of even calling me and getting a ride, of course it's my fault because she decided I would have been mad ..  \n\nI couldn't have any exes or friends of the opposite sex on any social media, would get accused of stuff when I just had a professional conversation with a girl we both knew about work stuff, she would go through my phone regularly I found out after years of being together thinking we have trust... things like that. It's like the ones who are mentally or emotionally the most jealous are also the most likely to hurt you and see zero problem with their behavior... Narcism I guess.",

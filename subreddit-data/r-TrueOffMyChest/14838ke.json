    "postText": "This happened more than 10 years ago and I have since moved on, but I wanted to just talk about it because it\u2019s one of my craziest past relationships I\u2019ve had and I can laugh about it now. No real names were used in this post.\n\nI met my ex David when I was 20 years old. We met through a friend. For 2 months, I visited him on some weekends since I was away in school.\n\nIn those two months, I met who I was told was his godmom and young siblings. He told me that his real mom had died in a shooting years ago. His \u201cgodmom\u201d was living with him and helping him raise his siblings. I didn\u2019t think much of it until she called me looking for him one day.\n\nShe said \u201cthis is David\u2019s mom, have you talked to him?\u201d It took me back when she said his mom but I assumed she called herself that because she felt she became his mom.\n\nOne weekend, I came to visit like usual and we want to his neighbor\u2019s house, who was friend. He left me there and went back to his house for a second. When the friend came out and asked me where David went, I said he went to talk to his godmom about something.\n\nHis neighbor had a confused look on her face like I said something wrong and said \u201chis godmom?\u201d\n\nI said yeah the woman who is living with him. She said \u201cno, that\u2019s his mother. Like his actual mom.\u201d\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe this man lied but I didn\u2019t want to automatically believe her. Either way I was upset and when he came back to the neighbor\u2019s house, I ran from the house and drove away with the neighbor.\n\nThe neighbor took me to another one of their mutual friend\u2019s home, who also told me that the woman living with David was his mom. I found out through them that he not only lied about his mother but that he lied about his job and having a high school diploma.\n\nDuring this time, he called my phone nonstop. But I ignored him until we returned back to the neighbor\u2019s house. He was outside waiting for me and proceeded to tell me I was wrong for leaving him at the house. The audacity of him.\n\nI started yelling at him and asked him why lied. He at first acted like he didn\u2019t know what I was talking about but eventually came clean. And would you believe this man\u2019s reasoning?\n\nHe told me that he lied because his mom was abusive and he wished that she was dead. \n\nI was so upset that I didn\u2019t care and tried to break up with him. I got in my car to leave and he stood in front, preventing me from leaving. For an hour he stood in front of my car saying he wouldn\u2019t move unless I took him back. After a while, I said okay and he let me leave. But I called him when I got home and told him I was done with him. \n\nA week later, his mother called me with his real godmom on the phone. She asked if I could explain what happened. Thinking back on it, I probably shouldn\u2019t have said anything and just told her to talk to her son. But I did and told her and his godmom everything.\n\nHe called me a few days later cussing me out, saying I ruined his life by telling his mom. He said his mother attacked him and he was in the hospital. I told him that I didn\u2019t feel sorry for telling his mom but I hoped he would recover. But even then I didn\u2019t believe he was in the hospital.\n\nI didn\u2019t hear from him until he randomly messaged me on social media 3 years later wanting to talk. When I asked what about he said he just wanted to say goodbye before he went away and I said for what. He said he did something and was going to jail and wanted to reach me beforehand. \n\nThat was the last time I heard from him. Last I heard, he had a kid before that but that was it.\n\nJust wanted to post about it because I still can\u2019t believe it happened. When I met my now husband and told him, he thought I was joking. But nope it actually happened.",

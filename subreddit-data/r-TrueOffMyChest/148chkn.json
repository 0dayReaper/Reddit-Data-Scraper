    "postText": "Hi everyone, 28 yr (M) here with a 27 (F) gf  \n\n\nI wanted to open up a discussion about a concept I recently came across in a video - the \"balance of attraction.\" For the ones who want to watch it is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIjFcIleVU4\r  \n The fundamental axiom of this concept suggests that in any relationship, one person always likes the other more. This person is referred to as the \"adorer.\"\r  \n\r  \nAs the adorer, you're the one who shows more affection, more emotional investment. You're the one who, in many ways, puts your partner on a pedestal. But what happens when you feel like there's no room left for your partner to do the same for you? What happens when you're the one who always seems to be giving more?\r  \n\r  \nI find myself in this position. I am the adorer in my relationship. I love deeply, and I express that love freely. But I've begun to notice a certain imbalance. My partner seems to depend on me, and while I'm happy to be there for her, I also yearn for that same level of admiration and appreciation in return.\r  \nI'm sure I'm not alone in this. Many of you might be in the same boat, feeling like you're constantly giving more than you're receiving.\r  \n\r  \nHow do you handle being the adorer in your relationship? How do you communicate your needs without making your partner feel attacked or defensive? And how do you maintain your sense of self-worth when you feel like you're always the one giving more? There's a way to change the dynamic?\r  \n\r  \nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences.\r  \n\r  \nBest,",

            "comment": "I think I might not be able to help as I am struggling with this myself but I know what youre talking about and would like to express my opinion. \n\nI have been in a relationship where the other one was the adorer. This has only really become clear in retrospective, but yeah. A year after the breakup I am pretty confident in saying this.  He always put more effort into the relationship, was way more invested emotionally and not at all willing to let go of it for any prize and he showed that clearly. Our attachementstyles (he: anxious attached me: fearful avoidant) had a lot to do with that. He was also incredibly jealous because he felt insecure and was scared I would leave him for someone else. It put me under a lot of pressure and eventually drove me away. I broke up with him because I just couldnt bare with the guilt that he made me feel. In the end he would call me a whre for hanging out with my guy friends and would constantly make bitter jokes about me not loving him. It was horrible. Because at the time I really thought I did love him. And I had never been unloyal despite all his accusations. The one thing that made me break up in the end was the guilt he made me feel for things I didnt even do.\n\nSo if you want to keep your girl, my advice would be: dont do sht like that. It only causes her to run away in the end. If you feel like she doesnt give as much as she takes and makes you feel unloved: break up. \n\nBecause the hard truth is: Maybe, just maybe she really doesnt love you as much as you love her.\n\nWith the new guy I am dating it is totally different for me. Now I feel like the adorer. And I do think its because I am more in love with him than I have ever been with my Exboyfriend. But it might also be because I dont constantly get manipulated and guilttripped now. It is way easier to put someone on a pedestal if they treat you right.",

                    "comment": "u/DancingYack-490 Thank you for sharing your personal experience and insights with me. It certainly provides a different perspective on things. If you don't mind me asking, could you confirm if you're a woman?  \n\n\nI'm asking this because I believe the dynamics and social norms might be different depending on one's gender. As a man, I sometimes find it challenging to shine and demonstrate that I'm the right person for the woman I care about. I'm curious if being a woman, in your opinion, changes the dynamics when you find yourself in the role of the 'adorer'? Does it influence the situation in any different way?\"",

                            "comment": "Im glad I could provide a different perspective. \n\nI am female. And I am not sure if and how this affects the situation. I think in society women that are \"The adorer\" are associated with being desperate and needy, men that are \"the adorer\" tend to get more positive connotations like being a good provider and lover and appreciative of their girl. \n\nOn the other hand a woman that is being \"adored\" and put on a pedestal seems extremely \"cool\" and aloof. While a man that is being \"adored\" just seems to be unappreciative and well... an asshle.\n\nSo maybe being \"the adorer\" is worse if youre a woman because there is a certain societal judgement about it while a male \"adorer\" is more sympathetic to most people. Probably doesnt change how it feels to be \"the adorer\". I think this feeling of giving more than the other person and being more invested in the relationship feels equally shtty on both sides.\n\nMaybe thats just me, but these are the genderspecific associations I have regarding this topic.",

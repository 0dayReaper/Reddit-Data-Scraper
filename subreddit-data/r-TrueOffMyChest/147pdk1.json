    "postText": "Using a throwaway account to maintain anonymity  \n\n\nI (31F) ended a relationship with my boyfriend (34M) 13 years ago when we were 20F and 22M. Our relationship was long-distance, and the reason for our breakup was his choice to prioritize his studies over being there for me during a challenging time. Looking back, it may seem selfish, but at that moment, I was undergoing surgery to remove a chest lump and was hospitalized for a few days. It was a frightening experience, and I longed for his support. However, he informed me that he couldn't travel to be with me due to exams he had during that week. I would have readily prioritized being with him over any exams. Feeling deeply hurt, I decided to end our relationship once I had recovered.\r  \n\r  \nHe was profoundly affected by the breakup and made efforts to convince me to give our relationship another chance. However, I was too hurt for this.\n\nHe experienced depression, constantly called me, and reached out to our friends for support. Eventually, he ceased all contact, removed me from his social media, blocked my number, and seemingly moved on.\r  \n\r  \nOver the past seven years, I hadn't received any updates about him until recently when I created an Instagram account. Surprisingly, his profile appeared as a friend suggestion, and my curiosity led me to explore his posts. I couldn't help but notice how happy he seemed with his current life\u2014married, residing in another country, and sharing moments with his wife and their 3 dogs. The genuine affection he expressed towards his wife in some of the pictures evoked feelings of intense jealousy within me.\n\nIt suddenly dawned on me that it was my decision to end our relationship, and if I hadn't, perhaps it could have been me in those cherished moments with him. This realization hit me with overwhelming force.\r  \n\r  \nWe still have mutual friends, and knowing that Instagram often portrays an idealized version of reality, I deliberately chose to seek further torment by reaching out to one of our close friends. I casually mentioned my discovery, expressing how nice it was to see that Kyle had married and built a life abroad. My friend disclosed that she had attended their wedding, describing it as a beautiful celebration. She also shared stories about how Kyle supported his wife when she battled severe depression during their dating period. He actively sought professional help for her and initiated treatment, ultimately playing a significant role in her recovery. According to my friend, his wife hasn't experienced any depressive episodes or crises in the past seven years.\r  \n\r  \nI was happy to know that, as I genuinely wanted Kyle to move on and find happiness with someone else. However, it also triggered a flood of regret within me for ending our relationship. I find myself weeping uncontrollably because I now realize that I still love him. The bitterness and anger I harbored towards him for prioritizing his studies were nothing more than my own selfishness. In hindsight, it is evident that his need to focus on his exams and obtain his degree was entirely reasonable. Yet, my youthful and idealistic self, heavily influenced by romantic comedies and TV series, believed in an illogical notion. I wanted him to sacrifice everything for me, which he did not.\r  \n\r  \nThus, I made the decision to break up with him, only to lament it years later. He is a remarkably caring individual, a devoted husband, and I am certain he will be an exceptional father as well. However, I cannot help but wish that it were me in those pictures alongside him, rather than his current wife.\n\nSecretly, I catch myself foolishly hoping for their marriage to end in divorce\u2014an irrational desire, I know.",

Now you see him happy and want that happiness for yourself. that's not love for him, it's single minded jealousy.\n\nEdit: what =&gt; want\n\nPs: I'm sorry if it sounded too harsh. I don't mean to belittle or accuse you of anything. Envy and jealousy are normal, natural feelings. The important part is recognising them for what they really are (instead of thinking they're love) and not acting on them. You could start building, in your own life, meaningful relationships. You could start sacrificing for the people you care about (like he does) [but also please don't ruin yourself for others]",

He didnt decline to skip a lecture or something. Missing exams can snowball into you delaying years and that is coming from me who wasnt exactly a good student in school or unnie.\n\nThen you declined his attempts to give it another go. For 13 years you felt nothing. Now you are just jealous that he moved on and he is being good ( I wont say perfect because I know better than to trust Instagram and a friend's narrrative to describe the full extend of someone's life) to his new wife. \n\nYou even went as far as to delibaretely reach out a mutual friend to \"fish\" for how Kyle's life is.  \nHuge red flag for your manipulative nature.\n\nHere is the thing : even if you hadn't broke up with him for the exam thing, you would have broken up over something else. You have no basis that things would evolve the same way as they did with his current wife. Your breakup probably played a huge role on how he treats his new wife. You and said wife are certainly much different. \n\nIn fact I think that even if he were to break up tomorrow and you would approach him ( your post makes it clear this is something you would do) , it probably wouldnt work out for more than a few weeks/months.\n\nStay the hell away from the man, and stop stalking him. I realise I am being rude to you and might even get bashed by people for this, but your post  raises a big load of red flags all around. The guy didn't dodge a bullet, he dodged a cannon fire.",

Like calling you an old woman at *31*.\n\nAlso, being male, they likely won't ever experience how frightening it is to experience a breast cancer scare; (I know it can sometimes happen to men but is much rarer); it does literally make you think about your own mortality. They're probably young over all and haven't ever experienced a multi day hospital stay either. Hospital stays are awful. \n\nI'm definitely wondering if there were other people you could have / did call - family or friends - because you talk about him getting support from shared friends but not if you did. \n\nI don't blame you for being young and having idealistic ideas about how love might work, particularly if you were in a strange place where you were frightened and not thinking clearly. You definitely could have handled things better in the aftermath, it sounded like he was genuinely regretful - it shouldn't have been left to him to actually cut contact if you were intentionally going silent / no contact on him. That said it doesn't sound completely unforgivable for  people in their early 20s, most early 20s relationships are messy.\n\nHowever ... you're clearly still a bit of a fantasist, because you are not still in love with him. Not after 13 years of no contact; he's literally a different person now. You're in love with the idea of stability and being loved. You sort of seem to recognise this about yourself but you also sort of don't. Like yeah I am irrational, but also I cry about it all the time. Are you bored or depressed and coping with it through a fantasy life? was that what you were doing at the time?\n\nAlso, clearly he learned from the experience and supports/treats his current wife better. However he didn't 'fix' her depression, another person can't fix anyone's depression for them, and the no repeat occurences is likely just luck of the mental health draw.",

It doesn't sound like it was metastatic breast cancer. It sounds like it was a lumpectomy, or like she had some other sort of mass removed.

Were they not there to talk her down from dumping Kyle over her unreasonable expectations? \n\n&gt;Also, clearly he learned from the experience and supports/treats his current wife better.\n\nHe didn't treat OP poorly, though. He did what made the most sense for his future. It was what made the most sense for *their* future even. It wasn't like her was at the strip club down the street from the hospital. He was taking exams a long distance away. There are professors out there who demand you bring in an obituary to excuse you from missing a class due to a death in the family; it's going to be nearly impossible to be able to get all your finals rescheduled because your girlfriend a few hundred miles away is having surgery. \n\nIf she hadn't dumped him over this, she'd likely have ultimately seen him staying for his exams as a sensible thing that benefited them as a couple. Or they'd have broken up later anyway. If she wasn't *dying*, then him staying for exams made all the sense in the world.",

I quickly realized I made a huge mistake and tried to reconcile with her but she wasn't having it and I didn't blame her. I ended up spending a few years in a super toxic relationship before ending that, spent a couple more years single and in a dark place before meeting my wife who I've been happily married to for 17 years. She's a saint and my absolute best friend in the world we would do anything for each other and have been there for each other unconditionally. Every day I think about how grateful I am to be with her. As someone else commented, people change over time so who knows, maybe y'all would've grown apart as y'all got a lil older and had time to mature. At 31 you're still young. You sound like a self aware reasonable person. There's someone out there for you. Don't spend anymore time lamenting about what could've been.

As others said, what you're feeling isn't love, it's regret, nostalgia, sadness, jealousy. It's a mix of powerful emotions but don't mistake them for love. Just learn from your mistakes and invest your time in improving yourself/self development rather than pining for someone you can't have. You only have one life, so spend your energy making it the best it can be. Leave him in the past and make steps towards your goals. I suggest therapy to address your past wounds and heal them because unless you heal them you'll find it hard to move on and you'll make the same mistakes. It sounds like you're still young, still in you're early to mid 30s, you still have plenty of time. I'm 44 and starting again after divorce so there's heaps of hope for you lol. You're not over the hill yet, you can still make something amazing out of your life. Don't focus on the negatives but look forward to the good things that can come your way. I wish you all the best.",

            "comment": "&gt;However, it also triggered a flood of regret within me for ending our relationship. I find myself weeping uncontrollably because I now realize that I still love him. The bitterness and anger I harbored towards him for prioritizing his studies were nothing more than my own selfishness. In hindsight, it is evident that his need to focus on his exams and obtain his degree was entirely reasonable. Yet, my youthful and idealistic self, heavily influenced by romantic comedies and TV series, believed in an illogical notion. I wanted him to sacrifice everything for me, which he did not.\n\nAlternatively - maybe the reason this relationship worked and yours did not is that he realized if he truly loved someone he needed to be willing to support their SO through everything and that's why he was able to stay by her side and help with her depression. I'm not saying you're right or he's wrong or whatever - that's the type of situation where there isn't going to be a good answer to meet both of your needs. Were you a bit immature? Maybe, I don't know. The phrase that sticks out to me though is that you would have been there for him and he wasn't for you. That always hurts to realize and maybe that was just the start of the end even if you stayed together.\n\nDon't feel like you're \"missing out\" on him because he has ultimately been shaped by your breakup and relationship for better and worse.\n\nAlso you should stop looking at their insta. We all fucking look our ex's up so this is very much a \"heroine addict telling you not to do heroine\" situation but that doesn't mean it's bad advice either.",

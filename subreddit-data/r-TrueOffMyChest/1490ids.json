    "postText": "So this will be kinda long but I\u2019ll try to sum it up as much as I can. I went through a very traumatic time in these past 9 months including a bad break up, depression and finding my family member dead over the holidays. I\u2019m not one to really open up to ppl\u2026 in fact, I\u2019m the \u201cstrong\u201d friend. The one there for everyone Yet I seem to always find myself suffering alone. Go figure. I\u2019m also not the type to get close physically to someone\u2026 for me as I\u2019ve become an adult and started to come into who I am, hooking up isn\u2019t really my thing. However, I live in a city where it seems like loyalty and monogamy don\u2019t really coexist.  I went thru depression and have disappeared from the world essentially this whole time to heal. \n\nOk so I\u2019ll get to the point, roughly 8 months after my breakup I ended up confiding and letting my guard down to a friend Of mine. It took ALOT and we\u2019ve been friends for about 5 years. He\u2019s admittedly had feelings for me in the past but I was in a relationship and never saw him that way\u2026 once I let my guard down We\u2019d started low key seeing one another slowly\u2026I mean we\u2019d hung out prior but recently it became intimate\u2026at first it was REALLY awkward for Me and still kinda is tbh\u2026 but we\u2019ve become closer\u2026 like I\u2019ve met his parents, his Mom had cooked for me, I\u2019m really tight with his family, best friend, etc\u2026 the industry we\u2019re in (different aspects but work closely) there\u2019s a lot of temptations but for me, it\u2019s actually work. \n\nOne night he invited me out. We actually roll in similar circles and have some of the same friends. He\u2019s told Me he loves me and I always tell him I love him too. It wasn\u2019t anything to say it bc I tell everyone who matters to me that I love them ( I lost a couple of ppl in traumatizing ways years ago so it\u2019s important to me to let ppl I care for know I care for them If I do) \u2026.  Anyways,  last week he told me he had A Booking and we\u2019d have to hang out Another night, which was fine. But he usually post or tells me where and didn\u2019t. Odd but not anything to give too much thought. We ended up hanging out and going to dinner Couple of days later then out the next day.  (These details are important) Fast forward we went out for one of his events and he had the usual gang and some randoms. We pregamed before going out and I met some cool ppl.. (that night was crazy but not with him).  Me and this girl really clicked and pretty much hung out that night and kept in touch. She\u2019s looking for models as she\u2019s starting a new business venture And I\u2019m helping her out. \n\n2 days ago she hmu to ask me if I was going to support his next event as well As see when I was available to meet up with her for services. I told her of crs and I was excited for her to come hang. We\u2019re conversing and Something in me had to ask\u2026 so I say to her \u201chey how do you know (we\u2019ll call him Drew)\u201d she shared with me she just met him for the first time in person the night we met but they met on Tinder. She also ends up telling up they\u2019d recently slept together twice and he\u2019s met her daughter and cousin.. I was like damn that\u2019s quick but my heart sank. \n\nDrew has pursued me from the beginning. Like really pursued me and then it clicked the night we were supposed to hang originally Was their first time hanging out and hooking up\u2026. It hurt so bad.. also her carrying on about how into him she is and is really falling for him\u2026she asked if I knew anything bc I told her we were good friends, &amp; she\u2019s the type to get hurt, she\u2019d want to know if he\u2019s seeing other women\u2026 yea.. he made her feel like she was it and I told her it wasn\u2019t my place to say.I messaged Him bc he was texting me the same time telling me he loved me etc and I asked if he was using protection with other women, he said \u201c Yes; I\u2019d never try you like that\u201d but I\u2019m special to him. Granted he hasn\u2019t taken her out or anything he does for me but I told him I was done. I didn\u2019t really go into it but he\u2019s confused. I\u2019m just hurt.. now here\u2019s my dilemma\u2026 granted he and I said we\u2019d take things slow to be fair and weren\u2019t ready for a full on commitment, I wonder should I tell her we\u2019ve been seeing each other? \n\nI\u2019m hurt but I don\u2019t want to hurt someone else. It\u2019s only been a few weeks for them and now months for us\u2026I haven\u2019t wanted to talk to him at all even though he\u2019s HMU confused.. he\u2019s got some personal coming up so I can\u2019t see him to have an adult face to face but I did say we should talk in person\u2026really bc our circles &amp; business are intertwined. I\u2019m the type to cut ppl off even if it hurts.. We have history.. my \u201cloyalty\u201d is to him but he wasn\u2019t loyal to me right?! I\u2019m just so confused but don\u2019t want to hurt someone else even though it\u2019s not me and I\u2019ve been here longer. \n\nWhat should I do? Sorry this is long I\u2019m just writing as I\u2019m thinking but I hurt and also feel like I don\u2019t want to trust anyone again. I\u2019ve always told him if we crossed boundaries it would ruin things\u2026 I was right Wasnt I.",

Nothing, and when I say nothing interest me, not one single thing i would like to go deeper in. Plus one astrologer told me that whatever i choose i wont be satisfied so that plays in my head whenever i think about uni, but I know i HAVE to go and i will i just don\u2019t know how to choose the most acceptable option",

            "comment": "firstly, ignore astrology. going that route will mean you will never be satisfied. secondly, you don\u2019t have to go as soon as you leave high school. i took a gap year and it was the best decision of my life. i truly got to explore myself and figure out what i wanted. thirdly, you don\u2019t have to go to uni AT ALL. there are many other options like apprenticeships etc. and if you do choose to go, you can change subjects. my sister did a year of psychology and then switched to philosophy and japanese. don\u2019t do what you parents say you have to do, don\u2019t do what your friends are doing just because they are doing it and don\u2019t do something just because it sounds smart. give it time!",

You're just going to be feeding money into the system for something that you don't even value.\n\nGo into the workforce and actually experience the grind of day-to-day productivity. After a couple years of that, you might find something you're passionate about. Or at the very least you will feel gratitude towards appreciating something meaningful.",

I am based in Uk and took student finance for my uni, but I knew the area what I like, so this was easier for me. University should be well thought move. \nI would say get the job. Somewhere, it is not important where. Travel a lot, develope your curiosity! To find out what you like!. I am sure where something is, you just need to find your spark. \nAlso, I heard one good idea of what I regretted didn't come to me in time, to be honest. I am nearly 30, and I think this would work for you)))\nTake courses of, for example, barman job and travel around the world, you will have universal job where you dont need much landuage skills and you can afford to live everywhere and travel, so you can find nice place to live and work. \nThis will allow you time and space to think and find out what you want.\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "\"What Do I Want To Be When I Grow Up\" is an age old question. I think many people waste their college years getting a degree they never use because they've changed their minds about what they wanted to do. When I was in HS I wanted to be an aerospace Engineer and Astronaut.... well  lets just say It didn't work out that way. Turn the calendar forward 40 years and I'm a practicing attorney in multiple states with a law degree. My oldest daughter wanted to be a doctor and did her first two years at college as pre-med...well, she now manages a hotel with a bachelor's degree in psychology...... My point is, it's kind of a catch 22.\n\nI strongly suggest that you place college on hold for a few years and weigh your options. The military is a great place to sort out your life's desires....  (I did 6 years in the Marine Corps)  Alternatively, seek an Associate in Arts Degree at your local community college...it contains the first two years of most 4 year degree programs --all that general education stuff. So while you're doing that, you are also working toward your bachelor's degree but it gives you a couple added years to find your feet in the world as an adult",

Do you like to fix electronics?  Do you like to fix problem areas in relationships?  Do you like to fix problems of scheduling?  Do you like to fix problems with animals, or the environment?  All things that you would need to answer on your own.  \n\nWhatever you do, don't get wrapped up in \"What should I do?\"   or   \"What do I want to do?\"\n\nFocus on the problems that hold your interest.",

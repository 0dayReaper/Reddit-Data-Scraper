I am ready to accept anything tbh.i have depressed all my life , no friends , i talk to everyone , people like talking to me but i just get forgotten easily. i Tried to commit suicide 3-4 times but never succeeded . Man , I really hope these lumps arent some cancer shit. i have a lot to do , i havent ticked off a single item from my bucket list. I just feel empty as i am typing this , feeling nothing. hopefully everything goes well :)",

You know nothing yet, don\u2019t get ahead of yourself thinking the worst. \n\nAnd secondly, mindset affects our overall health and wellbeing, a poor mindset makes us physically sick. We\u2019re not so much what we eat, rather we are what we think. \n\nIt\u2019s time to start helping yourself, each day, find one thing you\u2019re grateful and thankful for. Just one. But do it every day, it will change your life.",

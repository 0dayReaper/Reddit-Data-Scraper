    "postText": "Dramatic title but they didn't die or anything. Things were always gonna plummet this way. \n\nIn 15 years we were romantically involved in the beginning as teens but that died off, for her at least. She didn't love me that way anymore. But it never stopped me from feeling that way. I spent so long hoping she'd love me again but never did, the delusions were so strong in my mind. And today she finally said it. It was never going to be romantic. Just platonic. And that I held on for too long.  She got into a relationship again, I became quiet. It was clear she had enough of my jealousy. I wasn't trying to hurt her, I just tried to process my own emotions without causing as scene. But that wasn't good enough. She blocked me on everything. And today I confronted her because I didn't know what had happened. \n\nShe said I'm never happy for her, that I was never there for her, that she could never be herself with me. Always tiptoeing around my feelings. She was right. And I knew it. I always knew it. And it always felt bad that I could never change how I felt so she wouldnt feel that way. I didn't want to break her heart or disappoint her. I just could never be the friend she needed and now it's all over. The last thing I said was that we're better off without each other and that we should never see each other again because nothing was ever going to change. She was always going to lose me one day and I knew that but I just hoped to God that wasn't going to happen. That she'd love me again. But she doesn't. She never will. And now I have to live without her and it's all my fault. \n\n\nW, I'll probably never stop loving you. And I'm sorry for all the stress and pain it caused you. I'm sorry I'm not the person you needed, that I couldnt just bury it and change how I feel. I hope the rest of your life goes your way, and that you stay happy. I'm sorry that I have to go and I dont think I can come back this time.",

    "postText": "I have never loved my family. You say you love me, yell at me the next night. You hug me and say you\u2019re proud of me, make fun of my identity. I\u2019m fucking tired of this, i want to never see any of them again except for my dad. At least he treats me with genuine love. \n\nMy mom has been the one that made me hate them in the first place. Say \u201cI love my family.\u201d, cheats on her husband of nearly 20 years. She says she\u2019s sorry and makes an entire emotional scene about it. I used to believe her. Keyword; Used to. Last month i was asked to retrieve her phone from her room upstairs and i did as she told. Out of both curiosity and fear i open up her Whatsapp messages and near exactly like me in November of 2021, same stair step and everything. Her bloody cheating messages. It\u2019s hard to describe my feelings. \n\nAfter all this is the woman i had loved and trusted for nearly my entire life and she had betrayed and lied to her family. Other things are helping to my rapid decline in mental health. At this point I\u2019ve contemplated and have attempted suicide. I just want to make my suffering end and lift a burden from everyone else.",

You wouldn't lift his burdens at all,\nBe there for your father and prove to your mother what a loving family is when you create your own family and remember, family is not always blood",

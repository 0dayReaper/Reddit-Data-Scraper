    "postText": "For background, this ex I and broke up about a year and a half ago, but we were together for a considerable time and from a young age. The relationship was overall fine until the very end when we broke up.\n\nI haven't spoken to them or seen them since then. Well, until the other night when I was engaging in a certain activity that one may watch porn for. I was flipping through different videos, trying to find one that I liked when this particular one caught my attention. At first, I didn't know why it caught my attention- it was just another amateur-ish seeming video, but the longer I looked the more I got this weird, uncanny feeling. The way the bodies were situated, I couldn't see discernable features, but it was a slow-burn realization as I pieced together the parts I *could* see. A scar on a leg, the part in the hair, body mannerisms looking familiar, etc. Just small things that when put together were creating the picture of my ex. \n\nEven then, I was only 95% sure it was them, but the icing on the cake was when I turned the volume on. I immediately closed the video and shut down my bedroom activities. This was right before I was planning on going to sleep so I just laid there in bed processing what I just saw, when anxiety and this giant ick feeling set in.\n\nI want to make it clear that I was not upset that they filmed themselves or that they were having sex with another person. But *seeing* it released a lot of feelings and reminded me of pretty traumatic things I experienced with them. While again, our relationship overall was fine, because we were together from a young age there were issues around sex that I should not have let fly and never will going forward in relationships. \n\nThings like often feeling pressured and coerced into having sex, them not respecting physical boundaries both during and outside of sex (feeling me up when I expressed I didn't appreciate that in non-sexual settings), dismissing me if I felt discomfort, making me feel guilty because our libidos were not that compatible (me being low-libido), and forcing me to do things I just wasn't comfortable with. Even when we were actively breaking up (it was not as clean or as fast as I wanted it to be) they still would try to get me to have sex with them. At one point during this time I felt like I had no choice and did. During the act I felt myself freeze up because no fiber of my being wanted it and afterwards I felt so disgusted with myself, so used and filthy. I broke down crying in the bathroom after.\n\nAgain, ALL things I would never let happen again and I wish my past timid self was able to take care of herself better and speak up. But because of all of those negative feelings around sex I had to work past because of this ex, seeing them in their own porn video has left me with this weird anxiety and disgusting feeling for days. It is making me remember things I don't want to and has been hovering in the back of my mind since. Granted, this was only a few days ago and I had no one to tell this to except here. So maybe getting this out now will ease the thought in my mind. \n\nI just needed it get it out so I am not simmering on it constantly. ",

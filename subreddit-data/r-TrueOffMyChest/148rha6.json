    "postText": "I was abused in my previous relationship, it was my first relationship and I was really pressured by my mother to stay in said relationship. \n\nShe guilt tripped me all the way, saying that my now ex was a tortured child and me leaving him would tear him apart. She said to me that I should be the one to be careful not to get hit. She said to me that it's natural for men to be inconsiderate during sex and cause pain and injuries. She told me to endure it. Unfortunately there are many more examples like these. \n\nI was miserable. His violence caused me to have permanent health conditions and emotional scars on top of those I have because of my family. \n\nWhen I eventually broke up with him, she didn't understand why I would throw away such a good man. She raved about how I was a bitch for leaving him, that I abandoned him when I already know he is a tortured soul. \n\nI didn't speak to her for a long time until she let go of the subject. Yesterday, we spoke and as I was explaining what the doctor said to me about said permanent health conditions, she had the audacity to ask how do I think I developed such ailments. I answered truthfully and explained once again my ex's behaviour. She told me again that this behaviour is the norm and then I told her the way my current SO is treating me. She remained silent for a while and then asked me in tears, \" then what do I do about your father?\" \"I don't know what to do\". \n\nI had thought about this outcome before, but still I was shocked. I don't know how to react to this. I don't know what to say. I've told her before, that if she wants to get a divorce she should do so, but she doesn't because of guilt.",

They can only cope in their miserable situation when they're other people suffering too. Because then they can say to themselves that this is how the world works and they cannot possibly change the whole world. It is truly fcking exhausting.",

Not to excuse what she did to you, in terms of pressuring you to stay in an abusive relationship, of course. But it\u2019s sad all the same.  I am glad you got out of that relationship, and are with someone who treats you as you deserve, and you got therapy when you needed it. I hope one day your mama gets help.",

TW for past ab-se and it's ramifications.\n\nObligatory \"this is a throwaway acc\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got into a relationship recently with someone I really like. They've been so incredible to me. Here's the thing though. I have had.... many ab-sive relationships. Before my current partner, my most recent one was three years ago with a girl who hurt me in every way you could hurt another person. It got to a point where it destroyed the way I perceived my own reality. And there have been others as well, some I can barely remember cause I blocked them out. I forced myself to stay single for those three years because I had so much work to do to be safe after that. I was in intensive therapy the whole time and still am. I have come a long way, and even despite what I'm about to say, I'm the healthiest I've been in a long time.\n\nWhen I'm with my partner in person, everything is perfect. I'm so calm and they treat me so well, it's honestly confusing to me to be treated with this level of respect. But the second they're not right in front of me, my brain starts telling me awful things about them. That they're going to be just like my exes, especially that last one. They have done nothing wrong, genuinely. And I don't want this to ruin one of my first safe relationships.\n\nI'm so confused. I'm going to be talking to my therapist further about this but any advice or anything would be nice.",

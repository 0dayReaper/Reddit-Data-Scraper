    "postText": "I really wish my ex would see this. I wish I could tell him things were not supposed to go this way and I never did any of this on purpose. That not speaking to him when he was the one person I spoke to for nearly 5 years everyday kills me but I had no choice in case I had to go to court with him. That him thinking I never loved him and I did everything that happened on purpose is not true and that I\u2019ve been crying almost everyday since we\u2019ve ended. We were both so messed up but so good for each other. I really hope one day I get over him but I truly don\u2019t know if I ever will. I wish he knew how I really felt instead of thinking I couldn\u2019t care less.",

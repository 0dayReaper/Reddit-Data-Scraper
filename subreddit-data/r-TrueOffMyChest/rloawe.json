    "postText": "I'm a 22 year old female. I'm introverted, I had one boyfriend who cheated on me 8 months ago and since then found it incredibly difficult to socialize. Not that many people made an effort. I'm simple, I dont have social media, I have a few friends but they don't really speak to me much. I'm average looking. Pretty insecure since my breakup. Im in college and on weekends work a 12 hour shift at a fast food restaurant to make ends meet.\n\nI dont know I felt really lonely, so I knew of a guy who works with me who told me his friend is doing sex work. I found him on Facebook and he told me how much he charged. Also asked me a bunch of questions about my sexual health. I never planned on sleeping with him I just didn't want him to find me weird.\n\nAnyway we met at a hotel, I told him I didn't want to have sex I just wanted to be held and given words of affirmation and care. He agreed and I paid him. I gave him flashcards. They all said things like im proud of you, you're doing so well, you're strong, did you eat, are you okay, I know you can do it, etc etc. And he just held me until our hours was up and then I bolted and I feel so ashamed and had to tell someone. But I don't speak to anyone so here I am.\n\nEdit: thank you all for the kindest words and making me feel better and less ashamed. Yes thats me immediately upvoting. I'm not good with words, so please know I appreciate it more than you know. Thank you so so much.",

Some knew I had a husband and a kid and we\u2019d just talk about life stuff. I\u2019ve never put myself in a dangerous position, nor did I sleep with customers. Some girls do but it\u2019s actually pretty discouraged by the clubs as the whole thing is to string the customer along as much as they can. \n\nBut if we\u2019re really going to talk about the dark side, it involves the yakuza. I\u2019ve heard stories of girls being lured from being a hostess to doing AV. Most times they can\u2019t even get out of it because they\u2019ll blackmail them.",

It also causes young people to withdraw from society and never go out which is called being a hikkikomori. They simply place way too much importance on working like it's people's only purpose. So of course lonely people will pay someone to listen and spend time with them. It's just really sad. This is why weebs who romanticize Japan are cringe because they really don't know how bad the bad parts of that culture is.",

It was all about consent and positive non-sexual touch.\n\nIt was basically set up like a yoga thing, but you got there, practiced consent, were paired up, and the instructor would have everyone do a cuddle position for about 10 minutes, then rotate and do another.\n\nThe consent practice was great, before you even started it was required you reject someone, and the person you rejected had to say \u201cThank you for taking care of yourself.\u201d It was a great way to set expectations and gives a safe space for setting boundaries for those who might have difficulty.\n\nOne of the most positive experiences I\u2019ve had.\n\nPeople forget that touch is such an important social behavior to humans(and other mammals for that matter), and it hits home how much of a noticeable oxytocin spike there is during those cuddle sessions, especially for those who are touch deprived. That\u2019s when I started taking touch seriously when it comes to health and mental health.\n\nIt sucks, because our society is geared towards getting our touch needs from sex and relationships, but if you look at the social structures of other humans, primates, and a lot of mammals, you realize that\u2019s just a stupid construct of our human society, we\u2019re all actually wired for non-sexual positive touch. It's part of the reason why this pandemic has been so detrimental to some people in ways they probably didn't even realize. \n\nSince then I\u2019ve had a few regular platonic cuddle buddies, where we basically just hung out, cuddle, and watch movies and TV. Sometimes even sleeping over and cuddling throughout the night.\n\nAgain, no sex or any expectations, just cuddling and hanging out.\n\nI\u2019m a straight guy, and have had, male, female, and other cuddle buddies. It\u2019s great.",

I\u2019m very introverted as well and had moved away from all my family, had no friends. I\u2019ve never been good at making friends.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWas in a relationship for 7 years and it hit me so hard that I couldn\u2019t eat and all I did was drink and sleep really. I\u2019d occasionally go to the mall because it was near the holidays and the people from the lotion pop ups would always be really pushy and grab my hand. It was the only human contact and comfort I could get. A 5 minute sales pitch with some random dude massaging my hand could make me forget how much I wanted to die for a few hours. I bought a lot of lotion. Lol I\u2019d have loved to have someone to just hold me for a few hours. Hell, I\u2019d still love that.",

A drowning person is desperate for air not because they're weak but because they need fucking air.\n\nI wish I had something helpful to offer, a suggestion or something to make it easier, but I don't, I've got nothing useful to add.\n\nI wish you the best of luck going forward, don't be afraid to address your needs, what you did wasn't wrong or bad or even cringe.  \n\n\nEdit: so at least as far as I'm used to, this blew up a bit, so firstly, thank you so much to everyone for the kind words and awards, I had a weird day but getting to feel like you helped some people is kind of the best thing ever and I appreciate everyone that took the time to say so.  \n\n\nIf anything I said helped you, I'm so fucking glad, you deserve all the help in the world, no one should suffer any kind of hardship alone and we're all in this together.  Anyone that needs a shoulder, for any reason, please don't hesitate to throw me a DM, I'm not always available to respond straight away but I will get back to you within 24 (probably) and I'm absolutely here for you if all you need is a person.

They\u2019re the only physical touch I\u2019ve had in 10 months, wife and I are going through a divorce and no friends left to speak of. A couple acquaintances from before I met my wife I\u2019ve started reaching out to again but far from what I\u2019d call friends. It\u2019s my old \u201cbest friend\u2019s\u201d birthday and We haven\u2019t spoken in 6 months. I think that, coupled with just a terrible day unable to get anything done, constant cleaning behind my messy boys, literally couldn\u2019t even get them into the car to go to the park, what a shit show. I feel like I\u2019m failing them, failing myself, my family. Admitting all this makes me feel weak. My ex would call me weak all the time for needing/wanting reassurance, kind words, loving words, touch.. the things I feel are necessary to healthy life, she found entirely unnecessary and unbefitting to say to a husband. Apparently, I didn\u2019t know what she wanted to hear either (the words I wanted to hear are what I\u2019d say to her) and thus constant fighting. Anyways. Not the pint of this post. Is there a point to this post? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \n\nAll I know is I resonated with that line as well. I\u2019m not weak. I\u2019m gasping for air. I\u2019ve almost taken my own life over this (I\u2019m ok now) and therapy has helped immensely but it\u2019s been two weeks and the thoughts are creeping back in. Hence the breakdown in front of my kids. Full sobs, so hard my whole body hurt. Just saying out loud that I must be more depressed than I thought and that I need help. I\u2019ll reach out to my therapist, and a new one to get on meds. \n\nHugging my boys is the only respite I get in all this madness. That\u2019s the best.",

Why is needing emotional affirmation more shameful than needing sex? Neither is shameful but I'm truly bewildered by the implication of one being more or less shameful.\n\nYou needed something almost everyone needs. You got it consensually, without coercion. I'm sure you'd prefer it from someone who truly loves you but I don't think that's a reason to feel shame. Sadness perhaps, but not shame.",

I was a non judgemental friendly ear to them.\n\nMy longest served/best client was Turkish, and after lurking in my lobby for a while went to private with me. He preferred that I wore a turtle neck and just chat with him about anything so he could work on his English. He is the one that mentioned that I didn't need the site to do what I was doing anymore after we crunched the numbers.\n\nI made more than my boyfriend (now husband) by about double and the *majority* of my \"work\" was just active listening and messaging. I used to joke that I had an intimate relationship with my phone (which wasn't far from the truth lol)",

Either you're lucky and find someone really empathetic towards you from the get go (eventhough you'll probably drain that person if you have issues or make him/her leave) or you pay. I also crave affection and it's sad but that's the way it is.",

I haven't been in any sort of relationship in years.  I don't have a social circle.  My family is small yet they feel like strangers.  To even have someone pretend to care about me would be (sorry for the gross imagery) an enema for the soul.  I would probably feel much better afterwards, but only after a really long and ugly cry.\n\nSadly, I don't even have the money or connections for that.  So my negative emotions continue to steep in themselves and I continue to put on a brave face and lie to people and tell them I'm trying.",

People do so many shitty things what you did was very constructive and really you should be proud of yourself.\n\nI see you are hard working, responsible(you work to make your own earning), you are sensitive and kind(you treated a random guy with respect what he deserved), you were committed(you didn't cheated your bf did) and i believe many more such things like this exists about you.\n\nAll you need is a close friend with whom you can have heart to heart conversation..lot of us misses such person in our lives(including me) and it is difficult sometime to trust. \n\nBut, i learnt something that everything we have today is a gift to us. All experiences good or bad are shaping a better version of you. So be grateful to everything and automatically you will feel happy about yourself.\n\nHope you find this note better and hope you find someone you really deserve. Take care!",

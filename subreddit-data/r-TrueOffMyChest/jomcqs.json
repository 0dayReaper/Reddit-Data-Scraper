The botched notion of freedom of religion is one of several points of evidence that the American Revolution was almost too easy. I\u2019m not talking about the actual warfare but the revolution in political theory. There are too many half learned lessons that have been encoded in American mythology and tradition. If you compare the French Revolution to the American Revolution you can see that years of fighting over issues of class, representation, and the role of religion led to a much more nuanced understanding of these things in French political culture and memory. In the case of religion Americans don\u2019t grasp that when folks like Jefferson and Adams talked about religion the fear wasn\u2019t necessarily religious repression, it was also fear of an entrenched clerical class. Something they had witnessed in France and was also present in England at the time. Both revolutions sough similar goals, however the circumstances and outcomes were different. The US came to interpret religious freedom as the right to shove religious values into politics and the French interpretation was that they didn\u2019t want religion anywhere near government (a goal they viscously perused).  A similar thing happened on the subject of taxes as well.",

Not in the sense that people can't use the morality from their religion to follow due process and create law based on that morality.\n\n&gt; ... and Americans are really trying to blur it every day. \n\nNo.  The bait and switch occurred years ago.  Every single state constitution name drops God.  Like, all 50 states.  The idea was that our rights are inalienable and immutable *because* they're God-granted and not state granted.  That's why the constitution was written in a way that specified that the government cannot take away those fundamental rights.  Now, it's not saying \"the Christian God\" is what grants rights, but rather \"Whichever God you hold to\".  But the idea that religion and government were intended to be separated as a protection of government from religion is just patently false.  It's to protect the religion from government.\n\n&gt; This isn\u2019t a \u2018Christian country\u2019 this is a country that simply promotes religious freedom and that includes the freedom not to be Christian. \n\nI agree on this point.

It was Christianity that began to shift it towards masculine, solely for the reason that they believed their one god is masculine, and the religion became really popular, hence, why you and many others assume \"god\" is only masculine. It's just like when legislation mentions \"man.\" Man referred to all humans, with males being wereman (where werewolf and other \"were\" monsters derive their names from) and the female wifman. But due to the fact that most of history involved a common partnership where society saw women as more valuable for the survival of the human race, (a shortage of males won't cause potential extinction, but a shortage of females definitely will) males took the provider position and females generally took the role as caregiver. This caused these weremen to spend a lot of time hunting or otherwise working with just one another, and at that point, why say \"were\" when everyone there is male? It became easier to just say \"man\" and drop the prefix.\n\nThese words never existed to cement a patriarchal power structure in legislation, it's there to be succinct.",

Also when you mention that law makers can write laws based on thier religion you should include the fact the law it itself has to have secular reasoning regardless of the motive for the law. The separation is definitely meant to block explicit religious endorsements and protect a secular government.",

Being much more grassroots and therefore small communities, without the tax relief, we literally would be too financially burdened to exist in any organizational capacity. Also wouldn't be able to afford property taxes in several parts of the country, not to mention being unable to fulfill the charitable parts of our mission. So please consider that: mega-churches and traditions that are well-established with wide membership bases and wealthy benefactors could survive taxation, but much smaller and minorty religions would basically be wiped out. You'd be left with the most wealthy and powerful churches only. I'm not down for that.",

Any church that has basically made themselves, or their clergy, a brand or household name should be paying at least some taxes. Id even say that they don't have to pay unless they take in 1 mil or more a year and then pay based on whatever income it is.\n\nThe church i attended growing up (and still do occasionally) is a small church in a part of town that's just getting older. Nothing in that area for young people so most move away and the average age of membership just gets older every year. Our pastor was a pretty cool guy. What he received was a small salary and the use of the 3 br house the church owned. No benefits or anything. When his 2 teenage kids entered college 1 year apart he got himself a job at IHOP waiting tables to be able to pay their tuition.",

The money was taxed when it was earned by the parishioners. If you tax their offerings to churches, then you have to tax any other charitable giving to other non-profit organizations. If the offering is used to employ the pastor and other church staff, taxes are paid on that as well. I'd love to understand the reasoning that would tax this and not Salvation Army or other charitable organizations.",

They should instead be \"followers of Christ\" in that they live his example. If they interpret that to vote one way or the other is on them, but it's ridiculous to pretend that because some people hate their beliefs, they should be allowed to vote based on them.

Its dumb to think otherwise. \n\nA lot of Christians believe that Isreal has a special place in the world(never mind how asinine that a \"god\" would have a favorite group but anyway..) so they may vote for the candidate that will give them special recognition. \n\nIts the same for a lot of issues. If you believe something is evil then you would use all your powers to get rid of that evil including voting. Thats the main reason so mean vote against abortion. They believe its murder of a child and it should stop. \n\nYour experiences dictate your world views and how you vote. So to expect religious people not to vote their religion is kinda burying your head.",

I remind them about our freedom of religion rights but the conversation always goes to them being the victim for being the true believers of \"the truth.\"\n\nJesus and our government here in America is coupled with victim mentality.\n\nWe are at a point where if you try to bring up freedom of religion and separation of church and state, they feel victimized! This is why Trump has a strong base with them because they feel that Christianity was under attack yet they know in their hearts it to be true so it must be law...\n\nHmmm.

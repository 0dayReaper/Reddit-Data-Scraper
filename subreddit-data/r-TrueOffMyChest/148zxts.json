    "postText": "I know this is manipulative. I know this is not right. I want to cut her out. She\u2019s vaguely threatened this twice, after the last time I took some space. Tonight she outright texted me saying she was suicidal and it was getting worse and she needed me to tell her directly I wasn\u2019t going to cut her out of my life for her to be okay. I urged her to check in somewhere if it was that serious and she proceeded to backtrack on how she\u2019s okay and is still able to work and will just take an hour or two tomorrow and she doesn\u2019t need help that bad. It felt like a tactic to get me to engage and I\u2019m upset with myself that I fell for it. In order to cut her out, I am going to have to cut out my parents and my other sister too, which I have already been considering for a long time. I will at least be able to maintain a relationship with my older brother. I just can\u2019t believe it\u2019s gotten to this point and I\u2019m pretty sad about it. She\u2019s always put me in the role of emotional caretaker and I just can\u2019t do it anymore.",

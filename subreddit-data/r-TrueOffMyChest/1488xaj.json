    "postText": "I\u2019m a 19 year old female, I recently got engaged to my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years. To keep things simple, my mother doesn\u2019t get along with my fianc\u00e9s mother. This has been going on about a year and a bit, and has gotten worse since I moved in with my fianc\u00e9s mum about 11 months ago. This has caused mine and my mother\u2019s relationship really almost fully collapse. My mother doesn\u2019t like my fianc\u00e9 simply because of who her mum is. She has commented on my fianc\u00e9s weight, looks, you name it she\u2019s commented on it, obviously making my fianc\u00e9 uncomfortable talking to or even being around my mother, I completely understand. I try to talk to my mum here and there but always leads to an argument.\n\nOur wedding will be in 2025 and we have just decided on a date, we\u2019ve arranged where the ceremony will be, venue, guests, and style. The big question everyone is asking is my mother coming? Whole reason being is that will she cause a scene? ruin the wedding? will she sabotage our happiness in any way so she can get a kick out of it. I also worry about this too. \n\nI feel like an invite is necessary as I would love my younger siblings and stepdad to come. Although I\u2019m coming to terms and this is my choice. \n\nDo I let my mother come to the wedding or should I politely tell her I\u2019m too uncomfortable?",

            "comment": "It is your wedding. It is supposed to be the day of your dreams, not nightmares. Both you and your fianc\u00e9 is uncomfortable around her. If she abused you and is against your relationship, has she really earned the right to attend your wedding? You are already stressing enough. If removing you mother from the equation will alleviate the stress, you should consider not inviting her.\n\nNo parent is ENTITLED to be a part of their grown child's events. It is an earned privilege, and from what you are writing it does not seem she has earned it.",

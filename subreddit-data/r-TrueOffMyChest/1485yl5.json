I come so close to acting on them and i hate it so much, i used to be able to keep them at bay by acting it on myself but thats not enough for them anymore, it just wants to do it to someone else im such a fucking monster... I dont want to be a serial killer I dont want to hurt people but my mind keeps demanding i do. I havent yet, but i dont know how long it will be before i break- maybe one day I miss my meds and thats it i cant hold myself beck anymore. i dont know is this worth it if im going to end up hurting people? fuck im just a monster thats all i am   \n\n\nI want to do it but i dont, i take pleasure in the vivid thoughts my mind forces me to experience of acting on hurting people and i hate it but i want it fuck im just a monster...",

            "comment": "When I had in HS, I\u2019ll just put it simply by saying I had similar issues. Won\u2019t go into detail. \n\nI was raised in Christian household (if not Christian/have negative options of religion don\u2019t cookie cut everyone that all by any means are XYZ) but for reasons I won\u2019t explain, I started having very invasive thoughts. \n\nI prayed, I read the Bible, I tried doing what I could think of to stop them, aside from telling anyone. \n\nYou know what I actually think turned the tide? Doing shrooms. \n\nI had such a self epiphany that it was major turning point on these thoughts. I was starting to defeat them leading up to this point, but the shrooms, by chance or by reason by them or just by the timing, was what toppled these thoughts out of my head and allowed me to be normal again. I was like 16/17.\n\nBest of luck. I can totally relate and it\u2019s absolutely awful. The good news is that you don\u2019t want these thoughts. \n\nThe bad news is you have them and are struggling to defeat them. Best of luck. DO NOT act on the thoughts. As you wouldn\u2019t want someone attacking you, you don\u2019t want to attack another.\n\nSo long as you have them, it\u2019s your burden to bare. You don\u2019t want to destroy a family by harming someone\u2019s sister, brother, mother. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to harm your family by harming them. Or harming your family by dealing with the repercussions of harming another individual. \n\nYou probably wouldn\u2019t want to deal with your sibling, mother or father getting hurt or killed by a random stranger. \n\nBest of luck",

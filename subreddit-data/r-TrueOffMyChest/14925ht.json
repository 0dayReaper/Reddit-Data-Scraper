I really looked up to him and I'm shocked he even did all that he did. \nI understand he's not perfect we all make mistake and would let it go if it was a \"reasonable\" thing but this wasn't a mistake. He's intentionally hurt several people and I don't know if he even feels bad about it and I can't bring myself to ask. \nHe means so much to me he's been in my life since I was 14 he helped me be more confident and comfortable with myself. I've learned to be a better person than I was because he showed me how. I'm starting to think he was only pretending to be a good person because there's no way someone like him would hurt others. The reason I'm shocked is because he always talked about how he hated people that do stuff like that and he wanted to get rid of them. \n\nDisgusted isn't enough to describe how I feel about this. I think he might go to prison but the way the system is I doubt it. I'm so stressed to the point that it's affecting my physical health. My headaches are different and I constantly feel like throwing up when I think about it and I'm getting sick I can feel parts of my body not working the same way, I'm scared my body might be slowly shutting down.\nI want to hate him but I can't do it. I know what he's done but I still don't think he would do it and I'm denying it to myself even after I saw it. I want to convince myself he belongs locked away but I don't want him to suffer or have anything happen to him. \nI don't want to stop seeing him and I somehow still feel happy when I do and I hate myself for it. I can't throw away the things he gave me even now I'm wearing the shirt because it's always given me comfort. I hate that so much of my characteristics and mannerisms are modeled after him I can't completely change who I am. My partner and dating standards completely changed for the better because of him. I stopped pining over toxic girls just to find out the person I felt closest to was so much worse. I hate myself for not hating him and ive never felt worse in my life. I've had problems with friends and family before but it's never made me feel as horrible as I do now.\nI didn't grow up into toxic masculinity because he was comfortable with himself and showed me that it was ok to not be an overly masculine violent angry man that wouldn't do or look at anything \"girly\" but sometimes I feel like going against that just because of him. I don't want to be any different than I am now but I feel like going against everything I learned from him and be the exact opposite just to hurt him. I don't to be angry or violent or hateful unless if it's around him if it hurts him but I can't. It hurts to see him hurt. He's the best and worst thing to ever happen to me.\n\nI don't want to tell my parents or my friends because I know how they will react if I tell them and I'm scared my friends will stop talking to me.\nI know I should hate him and it's destroying me because after everything I just can't. \nI want to wish I never met him but everytime I try I get sad. I feel like I'm being a hypocrite for making this about how I feel when I can't even imagine how the people he's hurt are feeling and I probably never will.",

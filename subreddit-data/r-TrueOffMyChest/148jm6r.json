    "postText": "Well.. Recently I discovered something that I was ignorant of, or maybe I didn't think much about it. It is simply that my mother is the reason for my suffering in the first place.. I had a bad childhood with an abusive with my mother . She used to hit me and my sis and brother and wished we would die. I remember her choking us some times.\n\nAs if we were not her children .. All I remember about her are  most of bad memories. I do not remember hugging her in my life. I do not remember ever seeing her feel fear for me. When I got sick, only my father was there by my side. \n\nI remember when the virus passed and my aunt was infected with it. \n\nI hear  her once speaking with my aunt and she started  crying\n\n She was afraid for her\n\nand this is something that has never happened to me. I often feel an incomplete part when it comes to her, and yesterday I was sleeping in their bedroom because I was suffering from period pain. \n\nAt that time, I heard her talking in a loud voice and saying,\n\n \"All she does is sleep, and so do I.\" \n\n\u201cI do not like someone sleeping in my bed while he is on his period.\u201d \n\nThis was one of the things she said that affected me for a while. \n\nBefore last night .. \n\nShe complains about the pain in her legs, and I massaged it for her, \n\nbut .. nothing changes with her \u2026 from what I know from my sister, that my mother and her father were very harsh with them, but her mother was a very nice person, \nand I do not know why she treated us in this way. \n\nI really hate that I live in renewed trauma because of her, and I hate that I think In suicide because of everything that is happening to me .. \n\nThere are so many things I haven't said about her but seriously.. I don't know what to do I hate my life and I hate the trauma I've been through and no one was with me.. When I told her about the bullying I suffered for a whole year when I was in middle school And I tried to commit suicide twice  at that time ..\n\nshe told me that I was the reason for what happened because I did not respond to them, but she forgot that she never told me how to defend myself, all she was saying was that I should stay out of trouble and be a good person.. idk what to do .. \n\nAnd by virtue of the society in which I live, I cannot leave the house and live alone .. I wish I can do this ..",

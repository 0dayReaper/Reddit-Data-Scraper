    "postText": "It was a terrible marriage. She was so depressed, has a very controlling mother, brothers picked on her, she was molested or possibly raped by her brother for a couple years when she was 11 or so, and we were in a mind control cult (Jehovahs Witnesses. Her brother is currently serving as an elder in a congregation and it was never reported). She was the most beautiful woman I\u2019d ever seen and I was so in love with her. She was a humble sweet girl when she wanted to be. I was so happy to be married. She had a lot of things going against her I understand. But she wouldn\u2019t stop screaming at me, wouldn\u2019t get help, wouldn\u2019t go to therapy, and nothing I did would make her stop. I took her dancing often, sang to her at home and in public, wrote guitar music for her, write her poetry, prayed and read the Bible with her and it was never enough. I was a good husband. Was very patient. I thought we\u2019d grow old together. She screamed about where I left my socks and if I didn\u2019t make coffee. She hit me in my sleep once and consented to sex about 4 times a year. We were married for 17 years and I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. There wasn\u2019t a good year. I was afraid of her all the time. After I left, she realized it was ending and she went to therapy, got on meds, went to school, and tried to reconcile. She told me she knew I was upset, apologized and said that I could hit her if I wanted to. It made me sob so hard. \u201cNo I don\u2019t want to hit you. I wanted to love you. I just needed you to stop being mad at me. I could never hit you.\u201d I still love her but I can never be with her. Shes still depressed. She can\u2019t be what I need and it\u2019s unfair to ask her to change.\n\nEdit: I just needed to say this out loud. My family and all my friends won\u2019t speak to me since leaving the cult. Would love to talk to my mom but she won\u2019t respond to my texts. I\u2019ll be fine. Just having a moment.",

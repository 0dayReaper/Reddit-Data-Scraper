    "postText": "I\u2019ve been in a relationship for almost 2 years. I\u2019m 23 and she is 22. For a little backstory, she has some baggage involving family stuff that has to do with trust. Her parents divorced and it was a bad one. It all happened when she was younger. Now to my relationship. In the beginning it was nice, there were some bumps but overall it was great. Fast forward to recently, I went on a school trip to Rome and the entire time leading up to it I was met with texted from her like \u201cyou\u2019re leaving me\u201d, \u201cthere are so many girls\u201d, \u201cwhy are you leaving me?\u201d. I snapped and told her why can\u2019t she be supportive and it was met with the usual crying and I ended up needing to console her. On the school trip there was more girls than guys. So I developed a group of 3 girls and 2 guys. We made a group chat and talk about hanging out even now that we\u2019re home. My gf has made comments like \u201cI am uncomfortable with the relationship you have with some of the girls\u201d. Keep in mind, I have never cheated, never done anything secretive outside of planning birthday stuff for her, never given her a thought of me being unfaithful. I told her I would block them and leave the group chat if it\u2019s making you uncomfortable. I\u2019ve only known these people for 3 weeks so it would be nothing. But she constantly says \u201cno don\u2019t block them, you\u2019re allowed to have friends\u201d. It\u2019s been a constant battle with her about having minimal contact with my new friends and her feeling uncomfortable. The final straw for me was when we were being intimate and she thought I said one of the girls names during the deed. We stopped because we were both confused and then she begins to put her hands in her face and cry her eyes out saying \u201cI\u2019m so stupid, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019d accuse you of this. I\u2019m so sorry, I just don\u2019t want to lose you\u201d. I\u2019m at a loss for what to do. She clearly doesn\u2019t trust me and now your brain is tricking her into hearing things that prove her suspicions. After 2 years of being accused or commented on things I haven\u2019t done I\u2019m kinda drained. I know I love her but I can\u2019t be in a relationship where me even being around a girl causes problems. I wanna break up but I do love her. It just seems when she tries to be understanding things just spiral. Any advice?",

Are you willing to be this persons crutch for life? In my experience (happened to me twice in my 20\u2019s) I dated two women with emotional and trust issues. Always insecure and jealous. They BOTH cheated on me. I\u2019m far from perfect, but not a cheater. Also, it\u2019s not a gender thing. Anyone can cheat. Often people project their insecurities upon other people when they are doing they very thing they fear. Move on with your life.",

            "comment": "Sit down with her and have a honest conversation about how her behavior is affecting you and your relationship. Try to approach it calmly and without blame, but make it clear that the constant accusations and distrust are not sustainable in a healthy relationship. It may be helpful for your girlfriend to seek therapy or professional help to address her trust issues. It's not uncommon for people to have trust issues due to past experiences, but it's important for her to work through those issues in a constructive way rather than letting them negatively impact her current relationship. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide if you're willing to continue in this relationship despite the trust issues. If it's causing too much stress and unhappiness, it may be best to consider ending things. It's important to prioritize your own well-being and happiness in any relationship. Did she ever get cheated on before? Most people that accuse their partner of being a cheater are either suffering from past events, extremely insecure about themselves, or sadly they're projecting their insecurities onto you.",

I understand y'all love each other but 2 years of dealing with that isn't healthy at all and could leave a mental toll on you in the future. A good long-lasting relationship needs communication and trust and her accusing you of cheating already indicates that she doesn't have any with you. Her not trusting you isn't your fault btw she has her own issues and should've warned you or tried to hold off getting into a relationship until she knew she was stable enough",

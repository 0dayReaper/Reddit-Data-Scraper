    "postText": "So I have always had a rocky relationship with my mom, but recently shes been saying thing such as \"You're lucky im holding back\" or she will be very aggressive towards me saying \"you make me want to fight you\" and last night it was over tying my shoe but I was exhausted and asked her if I could do it in the car, she looked at me all crazy and tried to step up to me as if I wanted to fight. its insane to think about like why would u threaten ur daughter to try to make her scared anyways thank u !",

I also know what can happen if you report her and do not have anywhere else to go. \n\nSo, that is my next question, do you have somewhere else to go for a little while? At the very least, please try to come up with an emergency plan (and even a plan B just in case) so if you no longer feel safe or she does get physical with you, you don\u2019t have to try to figure something out while you are upset. \n\nDo you think there is possibly something wrong with her to make her shift towards this? There are a variety of medical conditions that make people change their entire personality. \n\nUntil you figure something out, please be careful and remember, there is absolutely no reason for her to put her hands on you for just living and being a normal daughter.",

Like when my son was in 8th grade and got in SERIOUS trouble and 8 days later, my daughter was a senior and also got expelled before she could graduate. Then I told them something like, whoever doesn\u2019t get into any trouble today, will get to live another day. They know I am joking, we have that kind of relationship. However, I would never saying anything to my children like you mentioned in your post. Like actually wanting to fight them. The job of a parent is to make your child feel safe and loved.",

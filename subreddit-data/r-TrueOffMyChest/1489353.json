    "postText": "Hey Reddit,\nI usually don\u2019t post things in here but I really can use some piece of advice\u2026\n*before I begin - English isn\u2019t my first language so there might be some mistakes*\n\nSo basically what the title says..\nI (21f) live with 2 roommates - my boy best friend (22m) and a mutual friend of ours (21m)\nLet\u2019s call them - Dan &amp; Owen\nDan is my boy best friend. We met a \u05f3guest house\u05f3 for people who have little to none contact with their families and need a place to stay in our country.\nDan &amp; I became good friends real quick and we hang out very often..\nThis \u2018guest house\u2019 is time limited and (people come and go, some people must leave before others) when it was almost my time to leave me,Dan and Owen decided we all move in together as we are all financially stable (more or less)\nDan has this special sense of humor that I like but not everyone gets, sometimes he has no control and don\u2019t stop with his jokes even though he was asked to stop or no one else is laughing..\nIt didn\u2019t bothered me at the \u2018guesthouse\u2019 as much as it do now because I wasn\u2019t next to him all the time and we weren\u2019t roommates (the rooms at the guesthouse is gender separated)\nBut when we moved in together things got worse for me.. \nDan started points his jokes more directly and specifically at me - he started make more women jokes, more lgbt jokes (Im bisexual), firstly I ignored him or giggled a bit (as I said: Dan\u2019s humor is not for everyone but sometimes I find his jokes funny) the main problem is when I ignore him, Dan doesn\u2019t stop and take his jokes few steps further and makes them more harsh and insulting, Sometimes until I get angry and yell at him to stop, when I yell at him he tells me \u201cit\u2019s just a joke\u201d and that I need to get over it, grow up and stop being a crybaby..\nFew times it even happened in front of our guest friends and I felt so uncomfortable, I don\u2019t want my friends to think less at me or think they can\u2019t joke around or have fun when I\u2019m there..\nI consider myself very friendly with a broad sense of humor and I\u2019m trying my best to be a fun person to be with..\n\nI tried few times to talk to Dan about it and get him to really understand how much it\u2019s hurt me. But every time we talk about it he apologizes and things get a little better but then after a while everything repeats itself from the beginning\n\nthis issue makes me feel unwelcome and uncomfortable at my own apartment.. \nI don\u2019t wanna move out because I really love Dan &amp; Owen, they\u2019re here for me for everything for over two years now and they are my new family, I don\u2019t wanna cut contacts with Dan because of this but I can\u2019t live like this anymore..\nI know Dan and I know he doesn\u2019t mean to hurt me but I\u2019m tired of talking to him about it and I just need things to change for the better (Of course considering the two of us) so I can live my life peacefully, what should I do???",

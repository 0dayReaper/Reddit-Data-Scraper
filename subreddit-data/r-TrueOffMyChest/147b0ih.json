    "postText": "I hate you. You put me through hell, you would rape me, punch me, spit on me, and would take videos of me and called them yours for \u201cemotional support\u201d you play the victim. You tell the police in which you are friends with that you were scared for your life because of me and I get arrested. I got arrested because of you. You\u2019re my rapist, you\u2019re my abuser. You\u2019re my ex boyfriend. You used the fact that I was raped as a child against me. I have to deal with you acting as a man child I was your parent, I was your caretaker. If I told you I felt asexual you would rape me if I told you I felt like I wasn\u2019t loved you would rape me out of anger. I hate you. You bring your new girlfriend into the house and you fuck her, you fuck her every night and I\u2019m sick of it, im sick of hearing it. I\u2019m sick of you. I loved you and I couldn\u2019t get enough but it was a trauma bond that I feel like I can\u2019t get out of. I feel like a tiny mouse stuck to your glue trap that will only bring me pain and suffering in the end. I want this to all be over. No one believes that you raped me, no one believes that you hurt me, I have pictures and videos to prove it but no one will stop to listen. I hate you for taking every part of me that was pure away. I look at you and I still care that you\u2019re safe and I don\u2019t even know why. I\u2019m so sick of my conflicting emotions. You have hurt me beyond repair and I don\u2019t know how to fix it",

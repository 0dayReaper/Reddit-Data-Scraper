    "postText": "&amp;#x200B;\n\nI guess I have to thank all my shitty teachers and bullies who said I'd never amount to anything. I simply don't have the strength to keep trying to do shit anymore.\n\n  \nI don't want to do anything anymore because I'm tired of failing. I can't even bother to watch a movie anymore or even try to make a personal project. Even failing to pay attention to what I'm doing feels so bad.  \nI've tried to do a lot of different things in life. I've tried art, music, sports, but I can't do anything. The latest is game design. I've been trying to make a game, but I'm about to give up.  \nEven when I win, I feel like I'm failing. I got a degree, I learned a second language, I learned how to cook. I don't even have anyone to share these, so I failed again.  \nBeing an adult fucking sucks. I'm just not happy with life.",

You can choose to look at your failures and let them define your life and self worth, or you can look at your successes and let them define your life and self worth. You have a degree. Awesome! That takes dedication and willpower. Learned a second language? Fuck dude even I never was able to do that so thats awesome! You learned how too cook? Sheeeet you know how many adults I know who cant boil water, and here you are able to sustain yourself with your own two hands?! Fucking awesome!\n\nSometimes some people just needs words of encouragement to keep going. Othertimes people actually need professional help. Have you gotten looked at for possible ADHD or some other disorder that makes concentration difficult? Having a disorder is nothing to be ashamed of, and there is help out there for those who are serious about getting help and improving yourself. \n\nAdulting is hard, yeah, but we all have our rough patches. A temporary fix for me to get oout of funks has always been to watch a comedy show in Netflix while eating dark chocolate or drinking a mocha choco latte. The temporary surge in endorphins allows me to at least go to bed happy, and sometimes that happiness carries to the next day. Waking up in a good mood really does help. \n\nThe goal is to not have a happy life, its to try and have more happy days than sad days.",

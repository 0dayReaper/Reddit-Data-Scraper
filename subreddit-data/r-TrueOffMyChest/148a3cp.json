    "postText": "i (17f) live with my dad, my mom died almost 2 years ago due to alcohol poisoning. i found my mom in her bed. i loved my mom very much, she raised me, she loved me even with her alcohol addiction. there was a lot that happened between me and my mom that i\u2019d rather not get into. my father when i first moved in a month after my mom died was originally supportive. he came in my room and hugged me while i cried, he got me a new phone, and let me sleep out in the living room when i didn\u2019t want to be alone. but when the month afterwards when school started everything went downhill. i wasn\u2019t doing well in my sophomore year at all, i wouldn\u2019t do my work i didn\u2019t even try, i would skip with my friends often and hated going to school and come up with excuses to often get out of it. my dad did not like this at all which i understand completely because i never did anything either, i never did chores, i wasn\u2019t taking care of myself like i was supposed to or my dog but i was trying my best. my dad and i were always arguing about school, my dog, my chores. about 7 months after my mom died my dad told me i needed to get over it and not let it affect my schoolwork. i had terrible PTSD from it all and couldn\u2019t sleep ever because all i could think about was my mom, i got really bad anxiety and would have anxiety attacks in big public and hot spaces. i devolved insomnia, i couldn\u2019t sleep in the dark and would eat to cope with everything. he always talked about how much i ate, and how much junk food i was eating, my acne or telling me to watch my weight and to exercise. he always tells me that i walk around acting like i want nothing to do with everyone but i just had nothing to be happy about. everytime we argue he wouldn\u2019t talk to me unless i apologize even when it wasn\u2019t my fault. he hasn\u2019t been supportive of me at all and all i wanted was his support. i ended up moving in with my grandma after everything with him and there\u2019s so much more questionable things he did and so hurtful that makes me question why he would ever treat a kid this way or have a child. i lived with my grandma for a while and things were going better, i got into a better school and i got a job i eventually started caring about school more and got my grades up to the point where i\u2019m passing. my grandma was hospitalized though and i unfortunately had to move out and back with my dad. since living with my dad my grades stayed great, i\u2019ve been taking great care of my dog i keep my room clean ish and try to do my chores on time (working on it). my problem is he\u2019s still trying to argue with me and upset me and i\u2019ve been trying to keep the peace and just apologize when i upset him. for example everytime he yells at me i cry he\u2019s aware of this and he came banging on my door mad that i had one dirty cup in my room and yelled at me to clean it then accused me of hiding something in my room when i was just otp with my boyfriend. i did all my chores today and even did his laundry and folded his clothes so he didn\u2019t have to. i washed the dishes despite me being in a constant depressive state all day and he got mad at me because i forgot to clean up the living room. i do everything im supposed to now and it\u2019s still not enough for him i cant hang out with my friends because i cant \u201chave a dog and have a social life\u201d. i cant wait to be 18 and have my own life and be happy with my true love who\u2019s been heaven sent to me, i cant wait to not be held down by him and not waste tears on him daily because i\u2019m sure he hates me, he called me a bad daughter and is always so happy to talk to his other daughter. i\u2019m just done he clearly doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me, he doesn\u2019t want me to be happy, he\u2019s \u201ctaking care\u201d of me because he has to despite him never being here. i\u2019ll always love him but i can\u2019t keep letting myself be hurt by him, he gives me a soul crushing pain and i\u2019m done.",

            "comment": "As a teen I wish I would\u2019ve had someone offer me advice when I was going through the same thing. The thing that saved me is this book called \u201cAdult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents\u201d. Please give it a read. It has a chapter on how to deal with emotionally immature parents, like your dad, and how you can finally be at peace. \n\nTo sum it up, the things your dad does and says is not because of you. It\u2019s not because there\u2019s something wrong with you. It\u2019s because they have so much undealt with trauma themselves that they pushed so far down that the only way they cope is by treating you like this. Most times they can\u2019t change, but you can manage the outcome of your interactions by noticing their behavior, accepting it and realizing it\u2019s not you, it\u2019s them. This will save you so much heartache in the future and you\u2019ll be able to avoid future relationships with other emotionally immature people. \n\nHang in there! You\u2019re doing the best with what you\u2019ve got and that\u2019s the only thing that matters. You are doing a great job and you have such a bright future ahead of you. If you ever have the time or money, I recommend a psychiatrist and/or therapist. They are there to help and I can tell you that my crippling anxiety and panic disorder and ptsd is down to 0% now because of it. If you won\u2019t be able to get that kind of help any time soon, look up mindfulness techniques for anxiety or search on Reddit for recommendations on books for anxiety. \n\nI wish you all the best \u2764\ufe0f You got this!!!",

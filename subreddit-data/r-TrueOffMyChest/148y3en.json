    "postText": "I've seen a couple post and I wanted to get it off my chest. My beloved dog who was over 15 years old had to be put down because of her health problems on Friday 06/09.\n\nShe came into our live as a rescue and was already 2 years old at the tjmr. She was the sweetest dog who was never aggressive towards any humans or dogs. All she ever wanted to do is to be loved, have fun, eat as much chicken and treats she can get. She was so passionate, full of life and warming to everyone.\n\nShe was such a tough cookie, after surviving a scare a year ago and lived for another. She changed my life, my families and significant other's life forever.\n\nI was the only one there in her final moment, she was watching me the entire time and I told myself I needed to be brave for her and not cry. I tried, I really did and I couldn't help but tear. She gave me this reassuring look that it'll be ok and that she loves me no matter what. As I watched her take her last breath I couldn't help but cry like I never had before. I wanted to scream out loud with every fiber of me but I held back.\n\nI was and am still emotionally compromised. \n\nDid I make the right decision? Did I do everything that I could? Did she live a full and fulfilling life?\n\nThese are the thoughts that come across my mind since that day.\n\nI know she's in a better place, I hope she can eat all the treats and go on her zoomies again.\n\nI love you D. You are missed.",

The emergency vet rushed and was so pushy to kill her even after telling me she wasn't in pain -- plus my bf was being so thoughtless. I wish I had just ran out of there.  It was traumatic.  I'm not going to lie -- it will stay with you -- more intense now. And as time goes on every once in a while it will return for a moment - maybe something will remind you -- it's okay to cry then too.",

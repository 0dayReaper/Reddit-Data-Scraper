As I ponder the reasons or the topics the only thing that I know is true is I allow it because I\u2019m scared to be alone scared that no one will ever show interest in me again scared that I may never find someone ever again scared I\u2019ll have a lonely life and never be someone\u2019s everything. The next topic I dwell upon in depth is does this make me weak, blind, oblivious, fragile?",

You deserve to be respected. You can't be someone's everything if you don't love YOU first. Do you really want to be around people that you can't feel or be your true self with?\n\nYou're better than that, OP. Don't believe for a single moment that you aren't.",

In some cases, it just takes some of us longer to realize that. \n\nLearn to believe in yourself and trust your \u201cgut\u201d instinct. If you do not like something or someone or it/they make you uncomfortable-speak up and stop it. Set boundaries-you should not allow anyone to talk down to you or walk all over you. \n\nYou will never be alone if you believe in yourself and realize you have value-you will have your faith in yourself. Good luck OP!",

    "postText": "Using a throwaway. \n\nMy husband (30M) and I (27F) are expecting our first child. We have both completed our education, have stable job, and are making a good living. This was a planned pregnancy and something we both wanted.\n\nI live far away (in a different country) from my family and we only see each other about once a year when I go visit.\nWe are visiting for the next couple week and are planning to use this occasion to let my family know in person. I am about 10weeks along but the likelihood of me visiting again before the due date is really low. We had our wedding and announced our engagement completely virtual so we really want to tell this to my family in person.\n\nMy worries? My mother\u2019s reaction. She has always been very judgmental and always cared a lot about how things reflected on her. She always made it clear that she did not want kids nor grandkids (I am pretty sure she hates the fact that she is aging and being a grandmother would remind her of that). I had a good relationship with her growing up, mostly because I new how to not set her off. I am not a psychologist and she was never diagnosed with anything (and never will since she refuses to see a therapist) but I have seen the term narcissist mom around and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it was her. \nAnyway here I am, her daughter, pregnant. This will be her first grandchild. And now that the time to tell her approaches I am worried.\n\nFor context when we announced our engagement she didn\u2019t have anything to say, it was a \u201cOk that\u2019s nice\u201d followed by immediately changing the subject. \n\nFor this, I can handle and am expecting \u201c a non-reaction\u201d (similar to how she acted with my engagement), though I would of course love for her to be happy and excited, but I understand that\u2019s beyond my control. I am scared she could have a negative reaction, and start going down lines of why we are. It ready, and why having kids is a bad thing etc\u2026 . \n\nAt the end of the day, I know her view doesn\u2019t me and my husband are and will continue to be happy and excited for our baby, and this next step of our lives, but it hurts having to worry about how my own mother could react to what is supposed to be a happy news.",

You didn\u2019t have a good relationship; you had to walk on egg shells. If you\u2019re mother is not happy, so be it. One thing you take from this: don\u2019t be like her. Congratulations!",

            "comment": "Congrats OP! I had a similar enough situation. My family had been total a-holes to me all my life but especially the day before I got married. I did not want to tell them I was pregnant because I was in such peace. The relationship is still very rocky! I doesn\u2019t matter if you tell her or not. If you get a reaction or not. My best advice is be you. Love your belly. Post all the photos you want. Eat everything you crave. And embrace the new chapter. For you and only for you! \n\nShe very will might say \u201coh that\u2019s nice\u201d again, but don\u2019t put so much importance. Do what is best for you. Maybe if you have the chance, seek some therapy. Just to kinda talk it out and help get rid of the \u201cwalking on eggshells\u201d part of yourself. It\u2019s the best thing you can do for yourself and your new growing family!",

But before you do, and (I'm NOT telling you to do this, it's just what I would do), simply say to her, \"Well, since you're so disappointed you won't have to worry about ever meeting him/her. But hey, thanks for your support.\" Once the baby is comes, don't post any pictures on social media and don't send her or any of her family members' pics. The upsides are 1. You live in a different country. 2. You definitely know what not to do as a parent. Congratulations on your pregnancy!",

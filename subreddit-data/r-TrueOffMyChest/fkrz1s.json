Just yesterday I unfollowed some distant family members for posting bullshit about how Democrats just somehow apparantly invented and released the virus just to keep trump from getting reelected, etc.  One of them also posted a meme of Obama talking to Jesus and complaining that Trump is undoing everything that he did, and Jesus replying that Obama undid what Jesus did or some stupid bullshit like that.\n\nI have seen people posting to stock up because we (as in the entire US) are about to be mandatory quarantined, but oddly enough they are not freaking out about this because Trump is in charge and he wouldnt dare do something that harms them.  Imagine if this had happened during Obama and they caught wind of a mandatory quarantine.",

What they\u2019re really doing is selfishly contributing to the spread, increasing the severity of the curve, but getting the best care despite being responsible for increased mortality in the future. So it\u2019s like normal anti vaccine bullshit where they hurt themselves but everyone else has to pay a price too.",

Like people use brand names to describe things instead of using actual terms which makes sense since it's their specialty product (ex: Kleenex for tissue paper, Google for search engine or using the search engine), but Coke? It's a specific type of soda that comes in a red can. You can't use \"Coke\" to describe Diet Coke or Sprite or Pepsi for god's sake if that's not what you want! You ask for a Coke and I'm giving you the damn red can regular Coke.",

By the time this is all over, a majority of the global population will have been infected. There's nothing you can do about this.\n\nThe purpose of the quarantine isn't to completely stop infections. The purpose is to slow the virus in order to reduce demand on healthcare systems so that they can effectively deal with the situation without being flooded with infected patients all at once, until warmer weather comes. When warmer, more humid weather arrives, the virus will mechanically not be able to spread as well. It will not completely stop the virus, but it will make it more manageable and allow people to continue normal life as before. \n\nThis will likely lull people into a false sense of security.\n\nWhen the next flu season starts up again later this year, the entire problem will explode again, and will likely hit harder than it did late 2019/early 2020.\n\nOf course, **do not** intentionally try to go out and get it. That's dumb. I'm just letting you know that you will most likely get it anyways.\n\n**EDIT: User commenting below me is wrong, as they are only talking about first wave infections, while my comment is about the entire issue from start to finish. Yes, within the next 18-24 months, the chances are very high (easily above 50%) that you WILL be exposed to the virus. That is 100% a fact.**",

Please do not act like those models are either inevitable or not partly purposefully made worst-case scenarios intended by the experts to remind leaders and general public on the need for action. \n\n\n&gt; The purpose of the quarantine isn't to completely stop infections\n\n\nIt's surreal to hear this, because (i) eradication was the de facto initial point, and (ii) our secondary goal is hold the fort until vaccine availability. We have dampened, slowed down, and localized a wide variety of viruses, most famously ebola. We failed our goal to keep the brushfire localized or dampened as a negligible threat until vaccines became available. But if 3-4 weeks can drastically worsen the situation, the caveat remains true: 8-10 weeks of purposeful action can drastically improve the situation too. \n\n\nChina is at fault for so much in the early stages, but China also clearly did its utmost to eradicate this in Wuhan and beyond. It's not China's fault that nobody else bothered to actually quarantine until far too late (plus the USA is still very clearly not quarantined). The West had full opportunity to keep this constrained like ebola or other horrific diseases. This was a policy failure.",

It's only infectious after the person starts showing symptoms, it's drastically more deadly and makes people very sick so they are generally pretty easy to identify and contain.\n\nCovid is literally extremely contagious and spread for up to several weeks by people with no symptoms.\n\nThat's why a quarantine won't work. Someone seemingly uninfected but is in fact contagious gives it to someone delivering food, or spreads it when going to buy food, or at work. It only takes one person to carry it through a quarantine period then again due to the symptomless spreading it will build up again.\n\nAlso as someone pointed out to you as well they said by the time this is over, it's disingenuous to claim they are wrong by saying after the first wave it won't be that high. \n\nIn the coming months it's extremely likely we'll continue to see outbreaks once they think it's come to an end and lift the strictness of their policies. Ultimately people need to get back to work, factories need to produce stuff, people need money for food, people need to keep making food and getting it to stores and then to customers.\n\nThere is no comparison to Ebola, it didn't hit smaller regions which have far less normal daily travel to the rest of the world, symptom and spread wise you can't and won't ever contain it when people without symptoms can spread it easily. \n\nNo one anywhere had the opportunity to contain it like Ebola, even comparing it really suggests you don't have the first clue what you're talking about.\n\nIf Coronavirus was only spread by people who looked like they were about to die it would be drastically easier to contain.",

There are also a lot of false information spreading across the internet and it is difficult to tell which are fake. I just read a warning from the EU that Russia and its troll factory is spreading fake news about the virus. Be very critical and my recommendation is to follow trustworthy sources only, like the World Health Organisation (WHO).  \n\n\nMy understanding is that scientists currently estimate that the virus is rather stable and is not mutating fast, which means it makes sense to develop vaccine against it. However, it is a long road to develop it, and it is likely that first vaccines will become available next year. However, there are some existing medicines that might be effective yet they need more testing.  \n\n\nThere are some gestimations that the virus may stay around as a seasonal flu once the pandemic is over. I have not seen any article that says people would become immune. They probably will not. The thing is that your immune system becomes stronger against the virus and it kind of makes the virus weaker. So the infections will become milder over time.  \n\n\nYou should avoid getting the virus know, or it will spread too fast and the health care system will not be able to handle it well. It is also likely that you will infect people to whom the virus can be fatal. Social distancing seem to be working based on experiences we have know from Asia.",

If you can flatten the curve, like in South Korea, you're able to not overload the health care system and treat everyone properly. But if you're not able to get a hold of it, not only are those infected with this virus have a higher chance of not making it, it places burden on the whole system and the general care for all medical situations drops. \n\nIt's also true that South Korea's situation is because they tested more, but I don't think their death rate numbers will be comparable to the situation in US either.",

    "postText": "I had a reasonably good upbringing with supportive parents but for some reason when I was a teenager I started having panic attacks and dissociation when I got into romantic relationships. I\u2019ve nominally dated 3 people, last when I was 22, but these relationships have all been lackluster and shallow\n\nI\u2019ve also never had sex or made out with anyone, never had that sort of intimacy.\n\nI used to feel more okay about this but as time goes on and more of my peers seem to be in long lasting relationships, I feel more and more insecure and hopeless. I feel like not only am I behind in experience, I\u2019ve also permanently missed out on \u201cyoung love\u201d- stuff like making out in high school, dating around in college, having exes and all that. The stuff all the songs talk about and what happens in movies and TV and stuff. I get so jealous of people who have had the same partner since they were 19 or something. Why hasn\u2019t this worked for me? Am I missing something? How do other people do this stuff so naturally?",

Many people around the world identify as asexual/aromantic and is a normal experience. I\u2019d suggest checking out a few factual sources online on aromantic or asexual orientation :]",

As for being ace I was seriously thinking about it but I think the antidepressants I\u2019ve been on killed my sex drive, as I\u2019ve gotten older and more adjusted to my medication routine it\u2019s been coming back to a fairly normal level I think. Although I could be wrong! I still have no ways to explain the panic attacks",

    "postText": "This is a throwaway account because my sister knows it and my dad also has reddit. I am 15. Last night me and my brother got into a argument because he kept calling me a slur and i kept telling him to stop. Fast forward into my parents room they told me to give them my devices and i went to go give them my devices and i had opened the door the wrong way. I was going to apologize because i known i shouldn't have opened the door the wrong way she had said to not open the door that then she got out of her bed and started to slap me across my face repeatedly. (This is not the first time she had hit us out of anger for stuff). Then i had hit her back and cussed at her (This is my step mom btw). Then she started using her fists at me and in my face as well. This is when my dad actually intervenes and tells me to go put my shoes on and go outside until i can come back and not have an \"attitude\". Then she called the whole family and had told them that what i did and they told me to go apologize to her. This isn't the first time she has hit us or thrown objects like that at us before. Provoking us to be angrier then getting mad when were angry and then grounding us even longer. Because we should be mad at ourselves. I'm grounded and typing this because i have a trap phone. Now family from my dads side is calling me and telling me how I'm ungrateful and that I need to apologize because shes being a mother to me like my real mother can't. (She can't afford to come and see us because of her financial situation and other reasons). I feel like literally nothing right now. They would even mention that if i didn't like it here then i should go live with my mother. There is bad things that they do that she doesn't do and vice versa. But there both equally as bad as each other. If an adult hits another adult because their angry then thats aggravated assault but if an adult hits a child because their angry is considered discipline? Im not eating tonight and tbh i don't feel like eating at their table again.",

            "comment": "Hitting is never okay. Neither is name calling. Emotional manipulation is also unacceptable. Seems like no one knows how to properly communicate how they feel, nor the empathy to understand how others are feeling. I am sorry for your situation. Do not try to harbor anger, that only leads to a cycle of further anger and bitterness, which ends up being taken out on those around you. All you can control is your own thoughts and actions. From my experience the hardest thing to do is be the better person in a situation, especially when I know I am not in the wrong.",

    "postText": "I was at a rodeo a few nights ago with a buddy from work. We were walking around after meeting up. I had this weird feeling like we should go on the backside of the stands. \n\nThis particular side of the arena has some open space and wasn't really populated at the time so it was nice to just get my bearings. I had just got a hotdogs and drink and was feeling good.\n\nSuddenly, I saw a little commotion out of the corner of my eye. At first it was just a little scuffle between these 2 girls. Something about fighting over a guy. No big deal. They exchanged a couple slaps and it was over. I figured it was done. I was wrong.\n\nThey started fighting again. This time, it was worse. One girl came up and decked the other on the back of the head. When she turned to fight back the other girl punched in the jaw. They started getting ltetty heated and looked like it was about to turn bloody. One girl had the other pretty beat and was just pounding. I decided to step in.\n\nI don't know what came over me, but I knew it needed to be stopped. I looked around and saw nobody doing anything. Not even the boyfriend. I went full protection mode. Using my drill sergeant voice, I yelled at the two to get off each other and quit. I grabbed one of the girls and started pulling her off. A couple other guys helped get her off and back away. I got the other girl up and just firmly grabbed her arm. Not forcefully or painfully, just enough to where she couldn't attack. I tried to calm her down. I told her it wasn't worth it. That that girl wasn't worth it. I tried to tell her if she kept fighting she could go to jail. I told her to look at me in the eyes. The look of anger turned to sadness. It hurt my soul. I have a sister. All I could see were the eyes of a young girl who was scared and alone. I can't get her out of my head.\n\nI have a soft spot when it comes to younger girls. Not a sexual way, but a brotherly way. I have a sister and I consider myself, as a man, to be a protector of women. I'm in no way perfect at this. But I try to help when I can. I work in a ministry that is mostly full of teenage girls. They are my little sisters. I would die for them. \n\nNow, at work I get berated by that guy I went to the rodeo with. He keeps repeating the words I said in a demeaning tone\n\nAll I was doing is what my parents have instilled in me to do. I am a man of God. I just try to do the right thing.\n\nSorry for the long post, but it's been on my chest",

I have stopped a fight as well and getting those girls off each other was the right thing to do. Its actualiy really weird and kind of crazy that he is doing that to you.",

    "postText": "I hope hitting the driver side of my truck, which was already fully established in the lane fun for you as it was me. \n\nBeing \"late for work\" was a good enough reason for you to try and be confrontational with me. At the same time refusing to give me your information before the cops came.\n\nWas it a blast to magically be injured from the accident. When your Lexus passenger side full on hit me. Not only was you driving but you were alone.\n\nWhat love the most about this whole ordeal is the fact that OUR insurance (happened to have the same insurance company) found YOU at fault of the accident. But because you didn't like that answer you decided the best course of action was to sue me.\n\nMeanwhile the whole time I just wanted my truck fixed. I didn't lie when I could have. I never asked for the stress or financial strain you caused because I needed to put my truck in the shop. \n\nThat day I just wanted to go and look at the furniture at IKEA. Maybe treat myself to some cheap candy. But you ruined so much for me trying to be fast. You were ALREADY late so if you just waited a few seconds for me to pass you wouldn't have caused a whole accident.",

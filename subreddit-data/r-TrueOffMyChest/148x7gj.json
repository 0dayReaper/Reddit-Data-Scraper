    "postText": "This happened around 2 months ago I (15f) was on makeup for The Addams Family. I ended up missing a week of school and dressed rehearsal because I was in a mental hospital. When I get back home from the mental hospital I get a shit load of text if I'm still on for the play by my stage manager Sara (16f). I text her back really blunt saying I was a mental hospital. Sarah tells me I'm out of the play, so I just stopped going to rehearsal. So I'm sitting in class teacher walks up to me and tells me that I have to do the play even though she said I was out. So I text Sara asking her what the fuck is going on. She was like, you still haven't come to dress rehearsal. So I pull up to the play and I basically stand there and do nothing 5+ hours. In the room one was like, where were you and I would like I was in a mental hospital. 1 of my team members had the audacity to tell me I should have told them before hand. So I quit drama and just block everyone.",

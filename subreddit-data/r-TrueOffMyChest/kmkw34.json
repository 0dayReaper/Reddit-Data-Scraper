But my wife is gluten free, so whenever we get dominoes, however good of a deal we can get for my pizza is effectively negated by having to pay $10 for her small GF pizza \ud83d\ude2d",

Their process for making french fries is surprisingly meticulous, and their meat is made carefully to retain as much taste and grease as possible. their toppings are relatively high quality for fast food. You pay for the quality, which is surprisingly high. ALSO, notice they don\u2019t do advertisements or anything. They like to invest in their own employees.

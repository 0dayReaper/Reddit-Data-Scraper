    "postText": "EDIT: Well, this blew up. Thanks for the support, everyone. Appreciate ya. I\u2019m moving on and it felt good to get it all out here. Be good to each other. &lt;3\n\n\u2014\n\nWe were married for 15 years. Our marriage was wonderful. She always had problems with mental health but I loved her so much that I was willing to help her with those problems forever. She gave me two beautiful children who I continue to cherish.\n\n18 months ago she wanted to try polyamory and started a relationship with a guy she met online with my enthusiastic support. Three months ago that relationship ended. Three months ago she met another man who she fell in love with. They made plans for him to fly out here and for them to spend a weekend alone in a hotel.\n\nIt did not take me long to realize that polyamory wasn\u2019t for me. I had assumed that it would\u2019ve been a group thing but what she wanted was a private relationship with him. I tried my hardest to be OK with it but I could never get around the idea. I put myself through a lot of pain trying to make it happen and I couldn\u2019t.\n\nI told her that I couldn\u2019t do it, crying as hard as I\u2019ve ever cried before, and rather than being comforting for me, she went dead. All she could think about was herself. All she could think about was having to end her relationship with him.\n\nLess than a month later she left me. She said she\u2019s been unhappy for two years. But it seems awfully auspicious that she would say nothing for two years, only to say something once she was unable to have some other guy come over and fuck her. \n\nShe didn\u2019t have a job, I supported her and our family. I gave her 15 years of my life, abandoning any dream I might have so that I could work a job that would provide us a stable income. I gave her everything she ever wanted, entertained every hobby, and encouraged every dream she ever had. I was good to her. I was good to our children. I continue to be a fantastic father. But none of that seems to matter to her. All this seems to matter to her is that she get what she wants, no matter the cost, no matter the toll it takes on the people who love her.\n\nI\u2019m seeing other people now, I\u2019ve cleaned up my house, and I\u2019m moving on with my life. Still, however, I find myself incredibly bitter some mornings. I was wronged. She was selfish. And now my family has been cut in half because of it. \n\nThe most annoying part of all of this is that she\u2019ll never realize what she really did. She\u2019ll never realize how badly she treated me. She\u2019ll never realize how selfish she\u2019s been.\n\nPolyamory is a fucking joke and it destroyed my relationship with the woman I loved more than anyone else in my entire life. Last night she said she was going to come by and help me put up the Christmas tree with the kids. She stayed at her Airbnb, which her boyfriend is paying for. What a waste of fucking time.",

I let myself hurt for 6 months (decade long relationship with a kid) and then forced myself to do things. I did things for myself and realized hey this is fun. I don\u2019t have to consider anyone else\u2019s feelings. I had a blast. I ended up doubling my income too. Then out of nowhere I met the most amazing man. We\u2019ve been together 10 years and married for 5. We\u2019ve traveled and I know now what it\u2019s like to have a true partner. Life has never been as good as now for me. \n\nThere\u2019s more!  Karma does strike but sometimes it\u2019s not as quick as we\u2019d like. Turns out my ex that left me for a girl who was his sons age got him into trouble. They both ended up getting convicted on some serious charges and ended up doing 10 years in prison each. My ex got out of prison a couple of years ago and weaseled my phone number out of someone we both used to be friends with. This dude legit thought he could walk back into my life and I\u2019d drop everything for him. I laughed, told him how he could never measure up to my husband and that him leaving was the best thing he ever did for me. Ahole actually tried to say that he was the reason I met my husband. He legit thinks that he introduced us. They\u2019ve never met!  \n\nSo ex is all alone working some crap job in the middle of nowhere and he should be expecting a constable to be serving him real soon for back child support!\n\nStay strong love. Things will get better. The grass isn\u2019t always greener on the other side. The way this guy was with you, he\u2019ll be like that with her. You said it!  He\u2019s her problem now.",

The same reason normal people don't drop their parents the moment they stop being useful, or divorce their wife the moment they have cancer. Yet a significant part of our population also does exactly that.\n\nThe difference is the latter people at least know it's socially unacceptable and generally try to hide those facts.

I've been polyamorous for years now, and I always make it clear any relationship with me will be a polyamorous one. Only time I've ever had an issue was with an ex who was not honest about his boundaries. Now that's not to say you can't successfully turn a monogamous relationship into polyamory, but it is a lot of work and everyone involved needs to be 100% on board or it's not going to work.",

If you haven\u2019t already done so, get away from her legally, get away from her physically, and get her out of your head. She is not the woman you married, who had children with you, that person is dead to you . Mourn that person and mourn the \u201cyou\u201d that loved her but realize that you can\u2019t go back. Be grateful that you had 15 years of bliss, be grateful for your children, and be grateful that your eyes are now wide open.\n\nJumping back to add this: do not kick yourself - do not allow the hate and anger to consume you. She decided to leave your marriage LONG ago but held some level of love for you so that she searched for the most gut wrenching way to leave you to make sure YOU never love her again. \n\nThank her for that gesture - she did indeed find the most cruel and sadistic way to leave you and your children. \n\nTake her cue, never ever allow her back into your thoughts, never ever want or desire her again. The woman you loved, that you nurtured, that you supported is DEAD and only a shadow and a memory  remains of what she was.\n\nBe cordial and polite to the extent that her behavior allows for the sake of your children but never let her into your heart again. She wants to play Xmas Mommy with the kids? Fine, but you don\u2019t need to play the game. You don\u2019t need to be there with her. Cordiality is not the same as \u201clet me step on your heart with my high heels because I know I can.\u201d\n\nHeal yourself. Don\u2019t delude yourself. Don\u2019t let your wishful thinking get the best of you. Bury her memory and be free again.",

Polyamory was used as an excuse to seek a way out of a relationship that she didn't want to continue on, a safe and easy path out of your life. \n\nPolyamory wasn't the problem though, the problem was her intentions. Sadly, there are many abusers and not all use verbal or physical abuse; emotional abuse is probably the most common type of abuse, the hardest to notice and the most socially acceptable type. This makes it particularly harmful to people that put effort and base their relationships on trust, communication and support, because it makes them vulnerable targets of emotional abuse.\n\nPolyamory and open relationships require very high personal and relation maturity which most people don't have at the same time, that is the real reason behind most failed open relationships. They are actually used to jump ship once there is secure footing on the next one.\n\nIf anyone is struggling with their relationship or their mental health then opening their relationship won't help, it will make all problems worse by adding insecurities, trust issues, third parties emotional issues, etc.\n\nI wish your next relationship is more positive and that your wound heals quickly and thoroughly. \n\nCheers!",

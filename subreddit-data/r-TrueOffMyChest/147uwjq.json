    "postText": "I've recently been slapped in the face with the amount of opportunities given to people who are great with numbers (data analysts, researchers, IT in general). It just makes it so depressing since I heavily lack the skills needed for those jobs, I suck at math, I'd probably suck at programming too, and the overall idea of those of jobs literally do not interest me, so I really cant see myself being involved in that line of work.\n\nOne of my only strengths is my leadership skills, communication, writing, public speaking \u2014 the complete opposite of what's in demand now. I'm an upcoming freshman for college and the course i took is AB Communications, and my family believes I made a mistake because they say that course will be taken over by AI very soon. It's just so shitty to hear that knowing that it's one of the only things that I'm good at. \n\nI'm not from America, and IT courses are in demand in my country right now, making it even bothersome to me to swallow the fact that I may not earn enough money in the future.I just wish I was AT LEAST smart in math, but no, it all went to my comms skills..\n\nDid I made a mistake? I srlsy feel like throwing up, but I really just can't make myself be interested enough to learn IT or any analytics course and I feel like its all my fault.\n\n\nTLDR; I suck at math and my only skills are communications-based, but numbers-related jobs are what's paying good so idk what to do with my life now.",

You have a calculator at your fingertips, and computers automatically do most of the math heavy lifting.\n\n&gt;strengths is my leadership skills, communication, writing, public speaking\n\nThere is still plenty of opportunity there.",

AI automation will greatly reduce the number of manpower hours needed for things that require lots of numerical input and analysis; it\u2019s ability to replace jobs in other fields is mitigated by its need for inputs in order to \u201clearn\u201d how to do those jobs, which typically requires some significant amount therein as those processes are more complex than anything that\u2019s simple math (and all math is simple math).",

    "postText": "Hey guys so I\u2019ve been thinking a lot lately and need some advice. I (19F) have a friend (19F) who is friends with this girl (18F) who well call M. M and her have been friends wayyyy longer than me and (we\u2019ll call her j). J and I currently live together as roommates and she tells me pretty much everything. So her and her friend M have been friends since they were 5. And in high school M started dating this guy. Well around, I believe she said senior year, J ended up sleeping with him while him and M were still together and J still continues to sleep with them after they have broken up. I personally do not like cheaters. I keep telling her to tell M before she finds out herself and it\u2019ll be worse on her end. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I want to tell M myself because M is such a sweet girl who didn\u2019t deserve any of it. What should I do?",

            "comment": "I see that you live with J so it may be a bad idea to bring it up if your living situation becomes strained, or worse. If anything, make it anonymous! Maybe have another person tell them and they say they saw J and M\u2019s bf together. Or make another account and say something on there to M. My heart broke when someone told me about my ex cheating on me, but I was grateful for it in the end. That poor girl deserves to know. \n\nIt\u2019s easy to tell someone to just expose the cheater, but if you\u2019re roommates with a cheater who knows how low they\u2019d stoop in retaliation. If you\u2019re living situation would be ok, I say go for it. If not I would come up with a plan to do it anonymously. I\u2019m kinda crazy, so if I were you, I\u2019d take a pic of them in public and send it anonymously that way there\u2019s proof and this J person can\u2019t deny it.",

I socialised with people.\nBut guess what: those were not from my class, so i hardly get to see them. All temporary friendships to hang out during an event, if any were made.\n\nMy class is full of people who I find to be rude, addicted to drinking and vaping, and people uninterested in being friends with me.\n\nI have accepted that I might not make any friends in college. I'm okay with it.",

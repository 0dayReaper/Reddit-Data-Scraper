    "postText": "And I hate myself for it\n\nI never, ever understood why I felt so gross and used when I was never raped. I always thought I was crazy, making stuff up. I always felt dirty and sick after just hugging her. Because it happened even after innocent affection I was confused and scared of my own brain and body \n\nBut that was never the issue. I look back at memories i thought were normal. She would forcibly dry me after a shower until I was 13 and old enough to really put my foot down. She forced me to sleep with her naked (with underwear). If I said I didn't want to hug she would guilt me to the point that I was often called rude and ungrateful and then would push me into a wall until I gave in. When I refused to let her into changing rooms, asked her to turn around, or left to another room to change she got angry at me saying she had a right to see my body as she made me. She pushes me to talk about sex with her, even if the topic revolves around my friends or siblings. For a long time she would slap my butt when I walked by her. When i told her to stop she would mock me and again point out she had a right to touch me however she wanted as she made me. I feel disgusted in myself because how humiliating is that? Having sexual advances with your MOTHER? It's disgusting and I'm so ashamed \n\nThat's all. I just wish I could unrealize it all. I'm afraid of my friends somehow finding out and hating me for this",

            "comment": "You're the victim here, not a perpetrator. She did these things to you, not the other way around. You have nothing to be ashamed of, she's the one who did these sick things. If anyone were to blame you for this, they would be wrong. You did nothing to entice or encourage her to do it. And theoretically, even if you were to have tried to entice her, it would still be wrong as you were the child, and she was the adult. You need to stop blaming yourself, and place the blame where it deserves to be placed: your mother. \n\nShe has no rights over your body, you are your own person. She did these things for her own sick gain, and unfortunately you were the only one she could do it to. Please seek help from family, friends, or even a therapist. You need help in order to ease the disgust you feel about yourself. What happened is disgusting, but not because of anything you did; everything that happened is on her. \n\nI hope you're out of that situation now, but if not, I highly suggest getting in contact with someone who can get you away from her. Friends, family, and even the police. I understand if you're not ready to talk to anybody about it, but it would significantly improve your mental health, and the way you see yourself, to get out of that situation. \n\nNone of this is your fault - you were/are being abused. It is her responsibility not to do these things to you. As a parent, it is her job to protect you, not victimise you.",

You made it out of those moments. You made it this far and you can heal.\u201d\n\nPlease don\u2019t fall into the trap of blaming yourself. You\u2019re not responsible for her choices or actions. I can only recommend therapy and wish you the strongest of support. You\u2019ve made it this far. Keep fighting",

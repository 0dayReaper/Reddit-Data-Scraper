    "postText": "\n\n\n\nHi all \nI turned 20 last month and I\u2019m yet to lose my virginity. People always tell me I\u2019m good looking and are shocked when I tell them I\u2019m a Virgin \nFor context i have blonde hair, and im 6\u20192 with quite a natural athletic build. (I look a lot like Ivan Drago from Rocky) I\u2019ve been lifting for 3 months now and im already seeing benefits and I look bigger than some of my friends that have been lifting for years. I guess I have good genetics for this. \nTbh I didn\u2019t really get good looking till about 1 1/2 years ago, I had a big glow up. I was nearly in a relationship with a girl but i decided to bin it off because I didn\u2019t think I would work out in the long term which was a decision I regret tbh. I didn\u2019t have any relations with this girl sexually cos she told me she didn\u2019t want to do anything outside of a relationship and I respected that. But that\u2019s the closest I\u2019ve ever been to a relationship. \nI\u2019ve been teetotal for 2 yrs also, I don\u2019t really go out a lot, mainly cos I work late nights friday/Saturday. I can\u2019t really go into clubs sober and pick up drunk girls cos that\u2019s just rapey. I hardly use social media cos it\u2019s just toxic. Im not really that much of an out there guy. \nThe main concern I have is that I\u2019ve wasted my youth, and im just gonna keeep getting uglier with age, and that I should\u2019ve made more of my time. Will I be uglier at 30 or not? Idk",

What makes you uncomfortable is just a phase.\n\nSex is not the only thing in this world that should matter. \n\nThere is power, there is wealth as alternatives. At the age of 20, focus in improving yourself.\n\nI had intense conversations with a mature lady when she asked a very genuine question \"What else do you have to offer to the ladies other than being youthful and good looking?\" This hits me hard.\n\nI was a very late bloomer myself, I didn't have enough confidence until I was in my lates 20s. And surprisingly, along with confidence and success, women would gravitate naturally around you.",

If you are a Caucassian, the deterioration rate is faster than Asians. \n\nYou can probably observe how your parents looks were at various time in their life. That would be your reference point.\n\nAnd living a healthy life makes the difference in the long run. \nGood diet, enough rest, and avoid the oxidants.",

            "comment": "Lucky for you, if you're a straight man, society doesn't care much about your looks. I can also promise you that you care more about your looks than a potential partner does. Women are going to be scrutinizing your sense of humor, your intelligence (emotional and otherwise), your ability to converse, your loyalty and ambition. Those are the things that are gonna get you the ladies.\n\nYou're pretty young, so maybe try gaming to meet some women. You could also join a co-ed sports team to find a gal with some similar interests. Here in the states, in the midwest, things like softball teams, volleyball leagues all for casual adults, are a thing and they're a lot of fun. I wouldn't worry too much about the virgin thing, theres probably a lot of girls your age in the same boat.",

Go on some first dates and see what develops.\n\nSwitch to a gym with popular yoga (more women) and start a practice. Check out game night at a local coffee shop or explore your local live music scene. There are lots of places where you can meet women.",

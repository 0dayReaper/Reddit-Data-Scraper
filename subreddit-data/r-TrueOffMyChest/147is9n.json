    "postText": "Now I watched and joined eyeblech to see how fucked this world is. Now the reason is I've always had a not normal way to seeing death (I don't feel or show emotions when I see it). The reason is that when younger my dad showed me a cartel video filmed in brazil (you get the rest), then 4 years later I would hear him beating my mom for 1 year (sorry if it's getting personal) so I've always never really been disturbed by gore or torture sense. I know I may be a psychopath or a insane inhumane monster due to my lack of empathy and emotions due to those two things. So once I heard of eyeblech I joined it (I don't really know why). So I've seen  many bad things. I may need help but I don't know. I watch gore for 2 times a month at least. Now do I think the people in it or running it should go to jail? No. Do I think it's right what they post? No. Should they post what they post? No. Should it be banned? Yes and no. Yes as one guy said he it used it as a reminder of his mortality around heavy machinery, and it should as normal people shouldn't be seeing what's on there. But as I'm typing this it has been banned off reddit and for most likely the better.",

I browse gore a lot especially from that subreddit, but I never had any significant childhood trauma like that. You shouldn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re weird for wanting to look at that kind of thing, it\u2019s just something some people casually want to see out of curiosity. The world is a cruel place, the gore you see online is only 1% of all the crazy shit that goes on. So don\u2019t feel bad about it. 11 is wayyy too young to be watching gore though, I wouldn\u2019t want anyone watching it before they turned atleast 18 (I first saw gore at 17 and was disgusted by it, now I am completely desensitised and don\u2019t give a fuck)",

They have joined some sort of protest because Reddit is taking away the ability to browse from a 3rd party app \n\nI\u2019m sorry your father is such a pos. Her shouldn\u2019t have shown you a video like that and he definitely should not have hurt your mother.  \n\nI have always been interested in gore videos.  Although, I question why I can watch them and not be completely mortified I also know I\u2019m a well rounded individual full of empathy and love. The man getting eaten from a shark video has stuck with me a few days. They usually don\u2019t but that one did. Anyway, I don\u2019t question why I view really. As a 43yo I realize that death happens to us all. It comes in many forms and most are not peaceful. It does remind me of my mortality for sure. I think it also helps me be thankful I live where I live because a lot of these places the videos are from are 3rd countries. I also think it helps me understand the world and humanity a bit better. Some videos I will not open and others I just need to not watch completely. Besides that i feel I\u2019m pretty normal and I also like watching gore videos.",

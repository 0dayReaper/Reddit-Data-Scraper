    "postText": "I don't know why, but whenever im feeling anything I always wonder, what is this feeling. It's like I'm an alien or robot learning human emotions. Recently I got broken up with and it hurts, but I don't know why. \"Why does it hurt so much. It didn't hurt as much last time. Why do I hurt.\" It feels like I'm experiencing them second hand, like you were handed a lump of clay and everyone knows what it is except you. I don't feel like this is normal, it might be caused by my autism, it could be something else, I don't have therapy, I was supposed to get it but I haven't heard back yet, so there is no one I have to talk to about this.",

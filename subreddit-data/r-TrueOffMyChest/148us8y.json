    "postText": "My family is from a small city. I moved to the UK for uni a while ago. My mum doesn't work and of course overseas fees are mad so I know he works hard to make end meet. He also recently got a mortgage for his flat that he has to pay every month. Along with rent for my mum that he split up with, he has little money to splash around every month.\n\nWhere they live has been rocked with political and social issues, and while I always talked about moving before I went to the UK, I stopped after I realised I don't particularly want them to constantly be in my face and rather start my own life. \n\nA while ago he texted me saying he saw a nice property in London for sale. These adverts are all over the place here, I didn't bother looking at what he sent me and knew it'd be some awkward building in the middle of nowhere that'd be lucky to not have burned down when it's *eventually* finished. He asked for my 'opinion' and I said everything I could think of to dissuade him, not just because I sense he's planning on moving but also it's a shit investment. Of course I just kept my points generic. \n\nI didn't tell my mum since I'm not sure he told her or wanted me to. I just thought it was a done deal and just something I have to talk to him again at some point.\n\nI had a chat with my mum last night. Apparently the other day my mum ran into him at the supermarket. He told her he 'got a flat' in London. I'm not sure what that entails specifically, but I presume something irreversible. \n\nI am so annoyed. I can't understand why he asked me that long ago and then ignored me anyway. How someone can buy a property that is clearly a trap for people abroad, without even going to see the sorry pit of sand where they say it's going to be built. I'm not looking forward to the point where he announces that he's moving to London, and arguing with him about why I'm not moving in with him or seeing him more than once a month. \n\nIt sounds like none of my business, it's not my money and even if he happens to want to move there why should I stop him. Yes I do feel a bit bad for persuading him not to move so I can move myself. But I'm not even sure what he means by 'got'. In all likelihood, because I know for a fact that he coughed up every blood cell in him to scrape together a deposit for the flat he's in now, is that the deposit for the extra property is low enough he's saved it up over than last year or two, and he's paid nothing else towards it. That's another loan I can't fathom how much it is, but I'll give him the benefit of doubt that he salary still covers it. \n\nHe retires in 10 years. The mortgage for his current home is 30 years. He's meant to be putting away money every month so he can pay it off after he retires. I don't dare think he's doing any of that if whatever money he has to spend he flushed it into that thing. For his supposed intelligence working a near six figure a year job, he is dense as hell with money. My mum has always lamented how he sold his previous home because he was 'too stressed', when it was at it's lowest point, only to see it go up by a million now. He also told me he was fiddling with stocks a while ago, lost a good 50k or whatever, losing a good chunk of the deposit he needed. \n\nI don't see how he'll manage all of this alone, especially after he retires. I was wondering if I'd have to help him out a bit (by that time I should have a stable income already, perhaps with his pension there wouldn't be too much to pay for his mortgage). But if he's rich enough to splash it on wonky flats, he can go fuck himself. My own and my mum's rent is enough for me to pay already.",

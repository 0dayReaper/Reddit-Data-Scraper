But most people genuinely aren't personally effected by the election of a president or in your case a prime minister. Its so weird how much effort and vitriol goes into it all when it's all just a morbidly hilarious comedy. And thats not even to be nihilistic I actually really like politics i find it engaging and important. Ya know not that it matters one way or another but I watched the brexit thing and admittedly from a very selfish view I was in favor of the leave vote. And thats a very American opinion and I realize that. It just came from a place of individualism I just think countries should be able to decide what they want for their own country. But point being it was so interesting to not be the center of political attention and see how strangely similar this event played out like our shitshow played out. And its like watching a movie where your trying to predict the ending and you've already seen the directors past work so you kinda think you know how its going to go and your mostly right but there's still some juicy twists in there you just don't expect. And again very selfish but I fucking love boris. I totally understand its mostly an act but hes a fucking actor. And corbyn plays a fantastic almost Palpatine like character. Where he's got this vision and he wants to realize it and he just gets villianized so well and in the quest for his goal he gets consumed by power. And there's even like a massive global senate he's in favor of called the EU its just the best fucking movie that you dont even have to pay for.",

Normally our voting/elections/decisions aren't in any way that dramatic or enthusiastic.  Even our general elections aren't so confronting. Believe me, it likely won't get that movie-like again.  You've seen the most dramatic British politics will likely ever be. lol\n\nFor Brits, our political sides aren't HUGELY different in the way that the GOP and Dems are for you.  Our conservatives are pretty much just fiscal conservatives, not social and definitely not religious. You just can't pull that shit here. Our Labour party (Corbyn being an exception) are very middle of the road in terms of policies.  Left-leaning, yes, but not extreme.  \n\nIn comparison, you guys have this epic contest every couple of years and THAT really seems like it'd be movie worthy!",

Ive got lots of british friends so I try to keep myself informed. Corbyn is much more \"left\" by American standards. Which is i guess... middle right.... or right. I just picked him because hes the most identifiable from that side. But really our elections aren't nuts at all. They just get blown out of proportion. What's crazy is nobody even has a different opinion. Both the candidates usually believe in really similar ideas but our media knows the more they sell that its the \"craziest political race of the century\" more people will watch their channels and read their articles. Its really like hyping up 2 boxers for them to just tire each other out the whole time instead of actually knocking each other out. I learned about the oratory battles that pms prep for on Wednesdays or something in the UK and that just sounds hilariously bad ass, and genuine, and entertaining. I dont remember what they are called but they have to answer a bunch of questions and its some exhausting amount of time they have to do it for. That sounds waaaaaaaay more entertaining than frankly these softballs of questions network television throws at our candidates. Hell Bidens VP literally called biden racist. There is no way in hell hes going to have to answer a question about that.",

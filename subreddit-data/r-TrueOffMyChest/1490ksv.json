    "postText": "to start things off, i(17) am an introvert, so i barely go out with other people on my own. and most of time when i do go to see other people, i go to their houses but never really out in public. but sometimes i like to go out to places to do stuff with friends. \nbut, i feel like my family gives me no room to form a social like outside of school and go out with friends on my own. so, recently, i am going to go out with my best friend to go see a movie. however, my brother(21) wants to also see said movie. so he has decided he is also going to go see the movie when i go to see it. that might just seem normal, but this is not the first time something like this has happened. when i went to go to a bowling alley for a friends birthday party, my family decided they were going to bowl at the same bowling alley during the party. another instance of a similar thing happening, is my junior prom. i went to my junior prom with two of my close friends. my junior prom was hosted at a hotel that had a restaurant in it. my family decided that they were going to have dinner at the restaurant, on my prom night. so almost any time in my teen life i have wanted to go out with friends alone, my family has been present in the area. \ni should also mention, my brother is in a wheelchair and my mother is his caregiver. my brother also does not go out much and has not tried to go out to places on his own. i don\u2019t know if maybe my family is trying to put me and my brother on equal standing regarding going out. \ni honestly don\u2019t know if i should try and express how i feel to my family and if it would be rude of me to say i do not want my brother being present when i go to see the movie.",

It\u2019s not just your brother either, it\u2019s everyone. I think you should talk to your family and set some boundaries, because they may honestly not be doing it on purpose. Communicating is the best bet.",

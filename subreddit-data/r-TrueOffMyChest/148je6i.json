This isn't even all of it..\n\nBackstory because it's a long and frustrating situation: \n\nI'm not gonna write put everything because I know he's not on reddit but I'm still paranoid he's gonna find out before I can get my stance stabilized for this fight.\n\nI met D when I was 17 and he was 35 (yes I know...) in my defense I was going through a lot that gave me the need for love because I was going through a moment where it felt like nobody loved me or wanted me around and I was getting close to making another attempt on my life and was just looking for anything to give me a reason to stay.\n\nHe told me he knew I was 17 but he didn't care.. \ud83d\udea9\n\nD also had a roomate at the time named B. And B was a massive pervert (I'm talking pick locks the door when I'm in the bathroom having a shower just to try and catch a clumps of me naked.)\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nStart of story I guess.. \n\nSo I met D.. And at first he was a pretty calm guy. The kind of guy you'd want to get to know more about. To be honest it's hard to remember the good days since there's been so any bad days...\n\nIn May we got our puppy. I don't even remember how we came to the decision to get him I just remember the trip home with puppy (L) on my lap sleeping. \n\nAfter getting L after school (or even during school hours..) I'd walk to his place to keep an eye on L and take him out to pee and clean the mess he made while D was at work.\n\nI cleaned up what I could but I noticed every time I bent down to pick something up and stood up I became so light headed I actually ended up falling on the floor while picking up L's toys. I guess I forgot to take L out after all this or I ended up resting for longer then intended but when D came home he got angry because L had decided to go to the bathroom on the floor while I was laying down in bed.\n\nD barged into the room and started screaming at me to the point I was so scared I started to cry and the crying turned into sobing. He then picked me up without my concent and held me until I calmed down and kept apologizing to me..\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nWe had L for 3 weeks before I found out I was pregnant. D kept asking if I was sure it was his but other then that he didn't seem to phased by the news. That night we took L some pushed through the screen door and started running towards people coming into the building. \n\nL is and was NOT a big dog. Yes he has big dog energy where he can't sit for a minute without shaking and whining begging to run around and play so I can understand the fear he could still give people. \n\nI tried to catch L calling his name but he wasn't 100% sure what his name was yet so it would catch his attention but he didn't know what to do after and walking to him made him think it was play time.\n\nWell D caught L and pinned him to the ground before punching L in the head hard enough to make L yelp before D picked L up by the back of his neck taking him inside. \n\nThat night D refused to take me home so I walked and the next day I took L for a walk and never looked back..\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nSkip to our child (R) not yet a year old still had a few months to go before R turned 1 and D decided he wanted to take full custody of R. His reasoning: \"I'm to young to be a mom\" but yet I'm old enough to fuck? Ok lol.\n\nBut the full custody turned into he didn't want R to he wanted 50/50 back to he didn't want R then to agreeing with me on every second weekend until she's old enough to do longer.\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nA couple days ago (R is now 3) and D continues to send nudes then 'apologizing' or 'asking for naughty stuff' from me. I just started opening up about some of the stuff D put me through to my boyfriend and my boyfriends reactions kinda make me sad. My by listens to my stories with a pissed off expression as if he's not understanding what could make someone act like that.\n\nMy boyfriend has convinced me I should put an end to all this and take D to court for all the stiff he's put me through. \n\nIm not looking for advice but I'm just trying to register everything and try not to feel crazy if that makes sense.",

            "comment": "This is a complicated one. There are a lot of red flags in your post, literally. But the only red flag that should have stopped you was the age difference. Hindsight is a bitch though.\n\nYou should definitely talk to a lawyer about all this. \n\nYou're not too young to have custody. If anything, you can probably bring up him being 35 and trying to hook up with a 17 year old as a reason not to have custody of a young girl. Legally, a lot of this is going to be he-said, she-said so make sure you have texts, emails, voicemails, and so on to support yourself. Any judge with half a brain will see the ages alone and be on your side. \n\nYou probably also have enough grounds for a restraining order, which it sounds like you need.",

As for the age gape in court I've tried to bring it up in our custody battle but he started to fight with me and the judge got distracted telling him to shut up. So yeah I'm 100% bringing that back up. And I have everything from day 1 of R's life. And I'm 21 turning 22 in July so ik he was just pulling stuff out his butt at that time to make me look bad and failed.",

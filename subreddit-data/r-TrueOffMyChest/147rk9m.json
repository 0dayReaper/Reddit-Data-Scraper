Around a month ago, this girl (21F) started talking to me on instagram, and she is really nice to talk to, so we\u2019ve been talking everyday ever since\n\nNote that we don\u2019t know each other in real life yet, although we are from the same city. Each day we get a little bit more closer, and i know she\u2019s starting to develop feelings, but i don\u2019t know if i am!!! \n\ni know i\u2019m feeling something but i don\u2019t know what, and i\u2019m actually scared like today i woke up and thought \u201cokay maybe i should block her\u201d \nWHY WOULD I DO THAT\n\nwe have a date this saturday, i\u2019m excited and nervous at the same time and still don\u2019t know what to do\n\nbtw, i have a trip to london next week, and it\u2019s making everything more crazy, bc i want to go and meet people but at the same time it feels like i\u2019m being a moron by doing that",

I could be wrong, but it sounds like you have a traumatic past, which means these thoughts could be from the coping mechanisms to protect yourself. So find your happy place and let your thoughts go until you calm down. Bath, therapists, library, whatever works for you. \n\nStep 2- After you have time to calm your mind, slowly explore your feelings on that person. Why do you feel like you need to block them? Is it a red flag, or is it fear of being rejected? How much do you care? In a perfect world, how would you see your confident self with this other person? Etc. If you like to write, draw or paint, thinking about those things while being artsy can be helpful in calmly and rationally thinking things through.\n\nNow that you have calmed a bit, and thought through things (it's ok to take a few days to do that), what do you want to do? If it looks like red flags, block them. If it's fear or trauma based reaction, can you talk to them about it? If not, take it slow, get to know them and see if your lingering fears can slowly disappear. Are you feeling like you aren't good enough? No matter what though, don't underestimate good therapy. It can be powerful. If you work, a lot of companies offer EAPs, employee assistance programs, which are free and confidential. \n\nJust try not to make a snap decision until you understand where those feelings or thoughts are coming from first. I hope this helps.",

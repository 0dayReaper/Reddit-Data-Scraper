    "postText": "Me and a close childhood friend now live across the country because I moved from my home town many years agoWe virtually hang out on a weekly basis and for the last 4 years she's grown close with and developed a friendship with my partner who I live with. My friend was visiting me and working remotely so there was tv on in the background. I left to go take a shower and while I was showering they had an intense discussion about covid lab leak theory. My boyfriend felt very disrespected in this conversation and mostly because he stated my friend laughed at him. I did hear her laugh and debate him in the topic as i hopped into the shower. The next day my boyfriend came out of our room and told her he was deeply hurt and offended by what transpired the day before. He doesn't care about differing opinions on the subject but the way it was discussed. It felt blindsiding in the moment and my friend was distraught and I was upset he didn't loop me into the situation. They spent some time apart and I talked to them both to hear their sides. My friend is adamant she was perfectly respectful and objective in their conversation and my boyfriend is adamant he wouldn't feel upset over absolutely nothing. I did my best to be neutral and let them know i'm not taking sides but want them both to be heard and validated. I said that there's probably truth to both stories but their perceptions are different. My boyfriend apologized to my friend via text about his reaction when we were out to get space about the situation and things seemed a little awkward but okay. My friend was really rattled from the experience because she gets extremely dysregulated at the first sign of conflict and my boyfriend shared with me he would try to apologize again in person to make things more comfortable. He never ended up doing this because my friend would not leave her stance that she did nothing wrong in the conversation and it made him feel upset.  Everything seemed okay after time and the trip finished and my friend and i have been talking and virtually hanging out on a weekly basis for the last 2 months. I mentioned driving by a diner we visited twice in her trip that she loved and she sent me a long paragraph text about how i need to understand she doesn't have warm and fuzzy feelings about the diner or where i live anymore. I apologized and said I didn't realize that experience made her hate this whole place and she has just gone off from there and is is relentless that she did nothing wrong in the conversation with my boyfriend. She called him a liar and said he's greatly exaggerating what she said in their initial discussion. I keep trying to maintain a neutral distance because i also remember some things that happened differently than she does which can happen when emotions are high. My friend is not willing to see any other perspective other than she was right and i'm not sure how to approach this. we weren't getting anywhere productive in our conversation so she asked for space. I agreed and said i'd be here when she's ready and i'm willing to apologize or do whatever she need's to move forward but i'm hurt and not comfortable calling my boyfriend a liar when i didn't witness a situation that happened which made him upset . She messaged me a few hours later saying she's not ready to talk but she needs me to think about why my boyfriend gets the benefit of the doubt and she doesn't. It does not seem like a helpful or productive message and i'm feeling lost. \n\nTLDR:\nFriend came out to visit and had a discussion about covid lab leak theory because it popped up on the news they were watching in the background. My boyfriend felt disrespected by the way she was talking to him and because she laughed at things he was trying to say. He brought this up to her the next day but came across a little stern and blindsiding. My friend is adamant she did nothing wrong and that my boyfriend is over reacting and attacked her. She will not resolve the situation unless i agree with her but i'm refusing to take any sides and understand them both.",

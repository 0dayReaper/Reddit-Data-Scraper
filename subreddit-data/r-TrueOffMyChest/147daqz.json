    "postText": "I am so goddamn sick of my neighbor. He sits outside and gets drunk from 9am to whenever he passes out. When my wife walks our dog, checks the mail, whatever, he always tries to hit on her. Well, he has had some woman staying with him for the last two weeks... Last night my daughter exclaimed \"there are so many cops outside!\". Turns out he had sexually assaulted the woman and she had called the police, I saw him hiding from the cops in my driveway and directed the cops to his location but he ran away. I talked to the victim and she said \"he pinned me against a wall and tried to get me to have sex with him.\" This woman is gay btw\n\nCut to the next day, I see this shithead sitting on his front porch drinking beer. So I walk up to him and tell to him to stay the fuck away from my family and stay the fuck off my property. He flips out and starts throwing beer cans at my house calling my wife an ugly bitch and all this other horse shit. I call the cops, and they say that until he does something, there is nothing they can do. And in my head I'm like \"didn't he just try to rape that girl last night??\"\n\nThey told me to record everything, and if anything else happens call the cops.\n\nThis guy has been harassing my wife for six months, and now I find out he is a rapist. I feel like I cannot protect my family. I got my daughter and wife some pepper spray, and some security cameras around the house but I feel like it's not enough.\n\nI just want a peaceful life with my family.",

    "postText": "A few weeks ago after spending my last couple hundred dollars on getting my chauffeur's license and fire retardant clothes for work I thought I'd scored a really decent job. I guess it should have been a red flag that within my first two weeks five other supervisors either quit or were fired but at that point it didn't really matter I was already invested. After a few weeks of working there, being on call 24/7 I get called in one morning at around 4:00 a.m. to pick up and drive a couple roustabouts to a job about an hour and a half away. About halfway there on the interstate I begin to swerve and fall asleep so I immediately pull over, contact my dispatcher and tell him that I'm going to need to take a nap if everybody's going to make it to the job in one piece. He tries to encourage me to push on through and drive anyway which I refuse to do bc my number one concern is the safety of my crew and others on the road. They tell me to drive to a nearby truckstop and when I get there I get grilled about why I'm tired. Iunno, maybe bc I'm on call 24/7, we work ridiculous hours, work conditions are garbage so I'm trying to pull the weight of all the other supervisors who have quit and when I do get any time off I'm trying to sleep in a jeep in the summer in Louisiana.\n\nThe next morning when I show up for my regularly scheduled shift (on top of being on call 24/7) (also I'm literally the only supervisor who even showed up) I'm asked to turn in my gate key, my shop key and come back when I have a stable living situation. I state the obvious that this job is how I'm working towards it stable living situation and I'm told that it's not their problem.\n\nMan,  I'm tired and I hurt and I just don't see it getting any better. I know we can play the whole someone has it worse game but that's a dumb game that can always be played to the last person barely clinging to life and it helps no one. I'm just trying to blow off some steam. Sorry if I'm rambling but I just don't have the energy to proofread. Love you guys and I hope everyone's life is going a little better than mine today. And bc I hate to end on a negative note I'm thankful that the rain brought the heat down a bit \ud83d\udc9c",

            "comment": "So, I have to ask, after reading all the work-related postings on reddit - what are the labor laws in LA regarding pay for being in an on-call status? Were you being paid for being on call? Should you have been being paid for that?\n\nI could say that if you weren't rested to drive, you shouldn't have gone into work, but how does one plan for the possibility of having to go in at the drop of a hat, other than to refrain from drinking? I also know the realities of the world, and the demands jobs can make on workers, legal or not. But I would think if you were on call 24/7, that should come with pay, even when not at work.",

This place we were paid by the hour, guaranteed 40 hours, on call 24/7 but they split your driving hours and rig/shop hours so you can work up to 80 hours without getting overtime pay.\n\nAt the last place I worked we had an annual salary of 40k + daily bonuses. For overtime we got time + 50% (not to be confused with time and a half) so the way it worked was 40k \u00f7 52 = (roughly) $770 \u00f7 the number of hours you worked that week and that would determine your hourly wage. So if you work 40 hours your hourly wage is roughly $19/hr (even though that's not an accurate account of hourly wage considering that we officially worked two weeks on one week off so the hourly should've been counted as closer to $30/hr) but if you work 80 hours your hourly wage drops to roughly $9.5 and your overtime would only be roughly $14.25/hr. Essentially the more hours you worked the lower your hourly wage was and thus the less your overtime pay was. It's colloquially called Chinese overtime but it's officially called Fluctuating Work Week pay and it's a way to avoid paying fair overtime.",

It wasn't uncommon to work 18 hours then be required to drive everyone home with zero turnaround. That shit is unsafe and I'm not sure of the legality of it but having as many trucks totalled on the yard as there are operational trucks should speak to whether or not it should be legal.",

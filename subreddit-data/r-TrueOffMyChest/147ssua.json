    "postText": "I (36M) just can't seem to win. Every good thing that has happened as been utterly negated.\n\nI came into 2023 with an awesome job that highly over paid me. I was in a fling that was progressing well. Fling ends horribly and full of unnecessary drama that I didn't respond well to. I would move on but this thing hurt me more than I thought. I ended up dating someone new in March and I thought things were going well. Unfortunately, it takes a little longer for me to fully open up and she doesn't like that. She drops the I love you and I was honest with her and told her I wasn't there yet. This was perhaps a bigger issue because she would end things.\n\nIn comes my new team lead and instantly hates me. Slowly wants bring in her team. Eventually I lose my job. Did not want to return to my previous industry because I got super burned out and my health declined because of how overworked I used to be. I can't get a new tech role to save my life. So I go back to my old industry and the hiring process takes forever. The offer letter I would receive last week would be for a job I applied to first week of May. \n\nI've had great friends in my circle that have been there for me. But I can't keep leaning on them as a crutch. These issues seem small when compared to the struggles of others. This is the 3rd time I've hit a hard reset like this. Every time I have a plan and I start progressing to live life as a stable adult. Something happens and knocks me t square one. I can't anymore. It feels like there is no point in constantly starting over. And it's not like I do the same thing every time. Hell, I even managed to start building up my savings. I became more frugal. Nope. Account sits at 0.\n\nI finally come to terms that there are real issues out there and I just need to talk to someone and I'll be ok. I'm now in the hospital. Come to find out that the tumor I had treated with radiation therapy,  may have led to my heart failure. I am literally supposed to start my new job (don't know how, I no longer have suits) today but I can't. I'm in the hospital waiting to find out if I'll need open heart surgery.  It's fucking breaking me. This is my third major medical situation. Nobody in my family has a history of these things. I don't even have insurance because I've had no job and I sacrificed paying bills than extending my coverage.\n\nI'm now just lying here all alone, trying not to have breakdown. I've try to outgrow the trauma of my childhood. But my life has had more significant losses than meaningful win. I live my life in a perpetual state of waiting for the other shoe to drop. \n\nThanks for listening, I guess.",

    "postText": "I (F15) have an older brother (M17) in which we have never really had a sibling bond. What I mean is that he has always treated me like a friend no matter how hard I tried to spend time with him. About 8 or so years ago, my brother convinced me to commit various sexual acts over the course of about a year. On numerous accounts, I would refuse but he would force me by cornering me in a closet and locking the door, as well as holding my limbs so I could not fight back. For background, he has always been much bigger than me, and uses his size to intimidate me to this day. I got his attention, but not in a healthy way. Eventually it stopped and we grew distant again. Our household has always been very toxic and violent, and as the youngest, I was often neglected and was constantly forgotten. That's why I think I latched on to this behavior with my brother. But because of the violent nature within the house, my brain forgot about these incidents as a trauma response. Flash forward to about two years ago, things start getting better in and house, and my mental health improved, and I began to remember a lot of traumatic experiences from my childhood. At this point, my brother and I have the relationship of best friends, but not siblings. So it's good, just not what I want. For a while I was stunned by my newfound memory and I didn't know what to think of it. But overtime I convinced myself that he probably forgot too, because it was so long ago. I have no one to talk about this because my mother already thinks he will rape me (she does not know about this) because of the content of porn he watches (step-sibling), as well as my oldest brothers pure hatred for him, and I'm scared to tell my therapist because I don't want to be judged for continuing to have my relationship with my brother. I just want things to be normal, but I know it will never be that way. I just want him to be my brother again. I'm really not sure how to go on, because it doesn't change how I view my brother and that scares me.",

No amount of time will ever make the relationship the same. Your older brother's hatred is completely justified. \n\nThe fact that you don't view him differently, shows the depths of his hold and harm that he is done. \n\nYou don't deserve to be harmed, you are a victim and need to get the help you need. I implore you, please speak to someone.",

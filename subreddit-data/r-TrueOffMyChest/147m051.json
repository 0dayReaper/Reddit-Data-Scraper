    "postText": "I\u2019m now a (M19) but when I was 14 me and my step sister were normal for the most part we both played sports and had our free time activities we would play. But one day we both looked a each other and she kissed me. Me being so young idk what I wanted to do next or what she was planning to do I started kissing her back and one thing led to another and we ended it up doing it. If that\u2019s where it ended I would have been ok and been able to live with the regret but no. I was 14 and stupid. We off and on made out and made love for the next 2 years until we went on a family trip we\u2019re one night we did it and I was able to bust and stuff came out. That\u2019s when I thought enough is enough. So I went to my mom that night and told her everything. To this date she is extremely supportive and tells me to just not thing about it. But it still haunts me what a stupid thing I did in the past and I can\u2019t stop feeling like it\u2019s my fault. \n\nThanks for taking the time to read this idk I\u2019m not great at writing so I hope you can understand.",

    "postText": "It\u2019s been about five years since I\u2019ve dated anyone\n\nIt\u2019s not for lack of opportunity, but rather I wanted to wait until I knew I was ready. There were those that I got close to, but never someone that I felt comfortable enough to date\n\nUntil recently\n\nWe met through work, where honestly they set us up. Everyone was by themselves to practice but \u201csomehow\u201d we were the only two people paired together\n\nWe work together a lot, I always love to talk to her and make jokes. I stay late to help her get out and just talk to her. It\u2019s an easy trade in my eyes, because an extra thirty minutes around her? Pshhh I look forward to helping her at the end.\n\nShe\u2019s outgoing, friendly and truly cares for everyone. I\u2019m sure she could have any guy, but for some reason it seems like she likes me.\n\nIt\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve felt this way about someone. Since I\u2019ve wanted to know everything about them, because just hearing her voice makes me smile. I don\u2019t want it to ever end, even though it\u2019s just the beginning.",

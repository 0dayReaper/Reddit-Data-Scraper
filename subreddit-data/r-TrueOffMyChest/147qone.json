I am on it and I host events like game night, a food crawl, and dinners; most of the people who come - they come alone. I have made friends and my event members who come have as well. Try it out! There are virtual and in-person events.\n\nI joined the language meetups, and I am learning chess with other people.",

I'm not saying that finding friends irl is easy, I myself have very few close friends and I met them at work.\n\nBtw, do you play video games? Maybe you can find friends that play the same games with you.",

She had a huge bridal party (must\u2019ve been about 14 girls, friends ranging from primary school up to university). It made me realise how lonely I was lol. \n\nI have friends but nowadays, my friends and I have drifted apart (some of us go to different schools) because life has gotten in the way. I used to have one close friend who went to school with me, but she left mid-year last year and I\u2019ve sort of been alone ever since. \n\nDuring the weekends, I only go to work (sometimes go out if I have a day off), come home, relax, do homework/assignments (if I have any), eat, then go to sleep. My parents ask me if I have any friends and I honestly don\u2019t even know how to answer that question. When my 18th birthday came around, I celebrated it at home with my family. I tried inviting friends but none were free or even up to celebrating. \n\nI\u2019m hoping everything will change once I go to university this September. :/",

            "comment": "I'm sorry you're feeling so lonely. Your feelings make a lot of sense though. It's your heart's way of telling you you need friends. Listen to it and make steps to get there, don't drown it in unhealthy, solitary coping like alcohol, videogames, porn, etc. \n\nMeeting up with new people is a great idea. But there can be some barriers that you may need to address to be more successful. How are your social skills? Have you learned (from your parents or peers) how to relate to other people on a deeper level? Are there any psychological issues that make human connection more difficult for you? If you're feeling very depressed and hopeless, a therapist may be able to help if you have access to that. Know that there are so many more people like you (for various reasons, not all of them under your control), that you're not crazy or weird, that you're valuable as a person and that you have the capacity to heal and connect to others. You have accepted the problem, you can work on a solution. Good luck!",

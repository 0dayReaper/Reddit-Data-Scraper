    "postText": "Really just using this post to vent. Very frustrated. Seems like every time my life is going a direction where I can get somewhere better, things fall apart. \n\n\nBasically I don\u2019t have a car right now. I was living with my boyfriend at the time after getting kicked out of my mom\u2019s home. Not for anything egregious and my mom did offer to let me move back in and we have a great relationship now that we aren\u2019t living together. This was about 8 months ago.\n\n\nA few months ago a family friend\u2019s husband passed away and she doesn\u2019t do well living alone. Originally I was supposed to stay there a few days because my partner and I needed some space. It was a very stressful time and I was working overnight so my energy for anything other than sleeping and being depressed about my situation was low. I also was using a van service to get to work after the stress of him driving me was too much. \n\nFamily friend offered to let me stay with her while I save for my own place. That would solve my transportation issue as well because she offered to let me use her car for a year. She uses her husbands car mainly now. I am insured on the vehicle for a year so she agreed to let me use the car until it runs out.\n\nI have been living there a few months now. I got a new, less stressful job I really enjoy that pays a little less but I have time to study for the insurance exam I plan to take. I also can use the car to make grocery deliveries once or twice a week to supplement my income and save more. I am also pursuing my dream to be a dj and got equipment and am able to go to classes and shadow other djs. Life is looking up. \n\nNow here comes the problem. This is a family friend who has known me and my mom for years and we are very close. I am 24 and she is 50 but she always connected more with me than my mom who she worked with. She is a very generous soul and will give the shirt off her back for anyone. \n\nShe also had a car she gave to a coworker she noticed needed transportation. Their deal was that she was to pay the note and insurance. She fell behind on the note several times and my family friend asked me for advice about taking the car back. Mentioning she had a nephew that needed a vehicle as well. \n\nI told her I think it would be best to take the car because the coworker is not holding up her end of the deal. I suggested she give that vehicle to her nephew because then at least you\u2019re helping family. She didn\u2019t listen. Coworker totaled the car last week. \n\nSo now she wants to take the car I am currently using by mid July instead of next year. So that she can give it to her nephew. All because the third vehicle she has was wrecked by someone who didn\u2019t hold up their end. \n\nI have a $15 a month car wash membership just for this car. I\u2019ve offered several times to pay the insurance and the note and she has told me she just wants to help. And now I have to figure something else out. \n\nWhen I offered again when she was mentioning she needed to \u201ccome up with a new plan\u201d she said \u201cWell *nephew\u2019s father* is offering that too\u2026\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been offering the whole time?? \n\nI cannot justify my anger much because this is what I get for depending on anyone for help. Every time they offer, it ends up being too much of an inconvenience at some point. \n\nI use the car to run errands and go grocery shopping for her. I have taken the car to the dealership for services. Just got a ride to work Monday so I could take it to get a replacement for a crack in the windshield. Have calmed her through panic attacks, listened to her horrid dating app stories and told her, basically begged her to get help for her grief over her husband. \n\n\nI am hands on genuinely a good friend for them and I would do that regardless of if I were living with them or using their vehicle. I am holding up my part of the deal religiously. And because of someone else\u2019s mistake, I am being punished. And she has to take care of her family too but really none of this has to do with what I was offered and promised. All of this family lives out of state btw. So she is under the impression I will continue to live with her and help her without transportation\n\n\n\u2026 I could\u2019ve kept figuring it out without her help in the first place. I hate when people offer help and when you take it, change their minds. Just leave me alone to struggle. \n\nFeeling really bad because I hate relying on people. And this is why I barely trust anyone or believe anything they say. \n\nI don\u2019t believe this is fair, but neither is life.",

    "postText": "For the past few weeks my boyfriend (27) and I (m32) have been terrorized by the people we live with. We have had to involve the police twice now and have an active police report against one of them. We have had to block them and have the police step in to tell them to leave us alone. Today my friend of 12+ years said she is paying our way out of this situation. I am a massive ball of anxiety since we hadn\u2019t planned on leaving so soon. With everything that has happened over the past week we have no choice. I am so emotionally drained I can\u2019t even cry. The tears are there, but they just can\u2019t come yet. This week we will be free and able to get rid of the constant anxiety and stress. The sigh of relief is going to be so satisfying. The longer i stay on this planet the more i get disheartened by the people. I have always tried to find the best in everyone and sometimes that just doesn\u2019t happen. I have been doing my best to protect my boyfriend and our dog from the absolute insanity and I cannot wait to see where the road ahead takes us.",

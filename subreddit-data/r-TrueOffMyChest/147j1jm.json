    "postText": "I had a baby with my high school sweetheart. Then she dumped me about 3 months after, married a man who SA'd her when we were teenagers and went ghost on all of us, not seeing my daughter since her birthday. So now it's just me, the little one and her grandparents, who have been a godsent cause my job sucks. I do what I can for my daughter, who is 1 at this moment in time, especially considering I still live with my dad and she lives with her mom's parents, cause again, shit job, but i see her as much as humanly possible, buy her toys and books, read to her, spend time, etc. But I feel she still doesn't know who I am cause I'm not around as much as I want to be. I feel like at this point I've already failed as a dad. I feel like she doesn't have the best bond with me because I'm always working. My job cut my hours in half so I can't do as much as I want for her, not to mention the economy fucking me. I miss her mom, as much as I hate to admit. We were a beautiful family and this was supposed to be the three of us in this together. I overall feel like a loser, a failure as a father and a man. I don't know what to do with myself and I've gone back to having passive suicidal thoughts but I know I can't leave my baby.\n\nI'm overwhelmed. But thanks for listening. I'm anticipating a lot of criticism.",

The fact you're still there, still trying and still grinding for your daughter is more than a lot of fathers do. And you're only 20 to boot. I know it's hard right now, but things will get better - you've got a reason now.\n\nKeep going, brother. You got this.",

Be there for your little one and do the best you can enjoying the little things. I'm not going to sugar coat anything your going to miss special events that you would love to be there for and it's going to hurt but do the best you can she will love you all the more for it, big gifts and lots of gifts don't equate to amount of love for her, gifts from the heart do.

They'll take minimum wage earnings of a full time job and calculate it with that. Then she will start owing that much and every month it will go up. It could be 20 years down the line, but if she ever gets a job or benefits or settlement money, the government is going to take a cut that is owed.\n\nPeople often don't want to be vindictive, especially since the money usually doesn't end up being a great sum (up front). But I guarantee, nowhere down the line of being a single parent will you ever go, \"Jeez I really do have too much money, how pointless was it to make my ex pay me for their child they abondoned, I just have this cash of theirs lying about! It was so selfish of me to put my child's welfare over their feelings.\"",

My kids tell me all the time the most they remember was when i was unemployed for a stint and we made couch forts, ran around the house being silly and doing weird things together. I mean behind the scenes it was scary for me. It was getting close to us maybe losing the house and i never wanted to feel that again so i worked. Missed out on a bunch of things.

But from the sounds of it, you have a good support system. It might be rough, but my best advice is to just love your child, be compassionate, be their ear, even at such a young age we ask so much of children for our selfish sakes.

She made her choices, and you have to make yours. It is 100% ok and normal to miss her and hope for better, but her choices seem dangerous for your child and your mental health so her issues need to be dealt with by her and her family if they choose to help her.\n\nFocus on your daughter and employment like you have been doing. Employment is a huge factor in life, and between that and income, those are things that will decide so much for you in life. If there is anything you can do to improve that, do it. If there are courses you can take to give you a better chance or position, take them. Or look into schooling that you can get into. Trades are always good. I don't know where you live, but in my town, if you look at the school board websites, there are options for very cheap trades or classes for employment opportunities that are in demand in my area, for example, a friend of mine got personal support worker courses for a fraction of the price(like a $10,000 course for $3500) with a job lined up at the end because of the demand for care workers in old age homes here. See if you have any social services available to you. They can help you find these things and other resources if you can get a case worker. \n\nYou are so young, and there are resources out there. If you get the right help, you are very much not alone. Find a single fathers group if you can. Sometimes, just being with people going through something similar can really help.\n\nLoving your kid and trying your best is the most important thing, and you are doing that, so don't discount that effort. Keep going. You got this because love for your kid is driving you. Things will fall into place eventually.\n\nGood luck!",

Figure out where you want to realistically be in 5 years when you daughter is 5. Radical honest is important here, and so is asking for help and love, because sometimes we just need a hug. \n\n\nIf you're looking to move careers or take some schooling online to apply for a better job, start now. Just start asking everyone. Same thing if you are feeling lonely; I'm not saying g jump into a relationship, but in a reasonable time frame you could find someone to start dating. Being that the girl you date has to be okay with you having a daughter already, it's not an obstacle in your love life, but a filter. You get to filter out all the crazy and toxic woman and only find ones who will love your daughter just as much if not more than she loves you. \n\n\nWhen I child has adults in their life that love them more than anyone else, they are starting on a better foot than most. I'm sorry tragedy has struck you life and I can't take away that pain, but hoping that better days are coming your way.",

Go study something or get a certificate to something. Get some sort of qualification and get a good job. This should be your focus. In the meantime visit with your daughter as much as possible until you have your own place. \n\nMy mom raised me with no father.

My first two kids I was always at work and by the time I got home most days I was so trashed I had no energy to do much with them. It really sucked, but I thought I was doing the right thing because - money.\n\nOur third kid my wife got sick and I became her primary carer. Did everything with her. Actually got close to her. Best thing that ever happened to me. Shes 11 now and we are super close. We dont have much money but I know we have raised her right and shes an extraordinary person.\n\nWhen I read your post I feel like you are just confused about priorities. Kids are really simple creatures - they need love and positive attention. Thats pretty much it. Money is great to have but if making money means a toll on the relationship then you have to ask yourself what is more important to you.\n\nYou are right - in those early years you only get one shot at bonding with your kid. From what you have said you actually have a chance - here and now - to just make her the number one priority and find some balance with all the other commitments you have so they are managed but she is still at the top.\n\nI promise you if this is about money she will thank you a lot more for being there for her - for being at every possible event, recital, sporting event, competition, performance, and for spending quality time with her whenever you can, than about having the latest sneakers or fancy holidays.\n\nBeing a parent is tough - there's no rule book dedicated specifically to your situation and your unique special kid. You haveto figure it out by trial and error, and you \\*will\\* fuck it up. Repeatedly. We all do. But at the end of the day there's one thing you can do which will always be the right thing - shower your kid with all the love and positive attention you can give her. Make it clear to her that she is your priority above everything else. And at the end of it all, when she's an adult looking back, she will have all the benefits of that, and will know that even though you werent a perfect parent (none of us are) - you did your absolute best.  Everything else (self pity, regret, making it about you) is bullshit and not of benefit to either of you.",

It's a scary trip but you're not alone. \n\nIt sounds to me you've already realized this little person is your heart, and you're doing everything a dad would. That's always the first step.

So quit letting the big picture stuff phase you. Just look for the next thing you can do to improve your life and do that and then the next thing and do that and so on and so on.\n\nAlso I'd advise money management classes. Schools suck at teaching basics so I'd advise going to the library and borrowing some books.

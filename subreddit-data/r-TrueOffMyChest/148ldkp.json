    "postText": "So my gf told me to look for a recipe she saved in her screenshots, i was scrolling but first got to the folder \"fugly armpits\" and there were more than 200+ pictures. I asked her what the folder is about, and she said \"Few months ago I realised that some skinny people have extremely weird and wrinkly ass armpits so I wanted to check how often I see wrinkly armpits\"I looked through the folder and there sure were a lot of pictures of just... armpits. Which were wrinkly.I'm just confused, i don't know if it's a quirk of hers or if i should\u2026 address\u00a0it\u00a0somehow?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit: No, my gf doesnt have an armpit fetish. She told me shes saving them because \"it's like looking at a train wreck\". I asked her if she wants to do armpit stuff in bed and she immediately said \"aw hell no don't ever touch me there\". I guess she just likes to look at ugly armpits because they're weird? She also said it's like watching 600pound life but in an armpit version so...\u00a0now\u00a0we\u00a0know\u00a0lol",

It's actually quite fascinating because 80% of the time their parents are completely average looking and look nothing like their child. \n\nAnd then there's situations like the Hemsworth brothers where they all look so much alike but most of the attractive celebrities have average looking siblings or even below average attractiveness... I wonder about secret resentment? \n\nAnd then there's Benedict Cumberbatch who looks like exactly 50/50 of his mother and father combined which I find fascinating because I haven't seen that in other cases. \n\nApparently, you do not need two very attractive people to bump uglies to result in very attractive children. \n\n\n\nI also have an obsession with trying to figure out what mystery mixed breed dogs available for adoption in rescue organizations I follow are made up of by reading about their personalities and behavior and looking at pictures of them. Obviously not an exact science by any means but sometimes a dog is more likely to be adopted if people know what breeds are in the mixed breed dog. For example, my family and I are very familiar with German shepherds and German shepherd mixes so we always go for German shepherd mixes. \n\nI'll comment my thoughts on what the makeup is in hopes that a potential adopter might see the comment and consider the pup for adoption.",

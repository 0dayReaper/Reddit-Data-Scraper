    "postText": "I'm in therapy for this, but it's so hard making all these changes to make these thoughts go away. Sometimes it makes me cry with how critical it is of everything I do and think and say and I have to yell at it \"stop it, you are being mean\". It's made me scared to do anything on my own because it just calls everything crap and tells me I'm making a fool of myself and everyone will hate my work and me. How did I end up like this? This is so pathetic. I'm an adult but act like a scared child.\n\nTherapy is so hard. I'm having to notice and challenge the voice as my therapy homework, and it's making me realize how pervasive it is.",

It's a work in progress. I don't know if it'll help me or not, but hey, I can let my inner Mean Girl out . . .\n\n(ETA that my voice is often my mom's, and I'm not ready to talk back to her yet, even though I'm 54 and she's dead, so Chad/Brenda/whatever it is!)",

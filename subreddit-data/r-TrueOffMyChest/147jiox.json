    "postText": "Edit: yeah, this is a rather mild story, but the memory still comes up whenever I stop myself from saying something stupid.\n\n\nI am a scout and when I was 14 years old I was at a camp laying in a tent with another kid from my group. We were talking about all the kids from the camp. I was annoyed about one girl from my group and I said \"She changes her boyfriends more often than she changes her shirts.\" (That's a close translation of what I said, I don't know if there is a similar saying in English).\n\nSuddenly a head pops out from underneath all the scattered around stuff of a teenagers messy tent and the girl I was talking about, said \"Well thank you very much!\" in a very pissed voice. She stormed out of the tent and during the last days of the camp she didn't sleep in our tent.\n\n\nI can't blame her. In that moment I didn't care about her, but years later I realized how much of an idiot I was.\n\nWhen I was 17 years old we met again by pure coincidence on a national gathering for my organization of scouts. We were walking down a path with a few hundred scouts and she was screaming insults at me, obviously still angry about how I treated her three years ago, again I can't blame her for that. I didn't want to face her, being too embarrassed about the situation and ignored her.\n\nSince then we haven't met again, but now over ten years later I wish I could get the chance to apologize to her about what a massive idiot I was back then. That's pretty much the only regret I have in my life.",

    "postText": "Ever since I posted on my Tt some guy commented on it asking for my snap . Not knowing what I was getting myself into I thought it would be a great idea to give my snap to him . We have only been talking for 7 days and I\u2019ve told him how I felt abt him(only friends) . He talks about his ex and thinking about going back to her , and I give him advice . But whenever I talk about someone who I like he gets so jealous for no reason . Just last night he got into a relationship with someone (HE ONLINE DATES BTW\ud83d\udc80) and on the same day they broke up . He keeps telling me he loves me and misses me but I don\u2019t  think he means it as friends. He\u2019s also clearly lovebombing me and I don\u2019t know what to do , he makes me so frustrated bc he gets so mad whenever I make jokes or talk about some guy . Idk if I still want to be his friends\n\nIgnore how poorly I wrote this theres alot going through ny head rn",

Now, as an adult, if my mom expresses sadness over her friends or relatives dying, I do not offer her any emotional support and intentionally act cold.",

As you can imagine, a 16-year old learning their friend just died from drowning or a 19-year old finding out their best friend died from falling down the stairs won't be subtle.\n\nedit - i posted this in more detail on confessions, its the 'im a mutant and despise humans' one this post made me feel like opening up more abt my family",

Very well said.\n\nWarmth and love can be constant within us, but we're always allowed to choose who gets the best of us - and not everyone deserves it.\n\nI think of it this way: I have responsibilities and obligations. I have finite time and energy. Extra warmth and love, positivity and joy, these take energy.\n\nI can't give every single person I meet all that warmth and love, nor would I want to. It could lead to some very unfortunate misunderstandings, and I'd be burned out by lunch. Plus, that sexist jerk who bothers baristas doesn't need a smile - he needs to learn manners.\n\nBut I can identify who deserves it and who returns that warmth and love (not that they need to, but I require that from some people - like my partner). This way, instead of all randos getting my energy and attention, it goes to the people I truly care for.\n\nYes, smile and be pleasant.\nBut there's no need for every human being to have a flagpole in your heart. A general love is good, compassion is good, empathy is good. But boundaries keep us healthy.",

As a child, I was physically and mentally abused.  I called for help in many ways, but everyone ignored me.  Nobody ever came to help, and my father further abused me whenever he found out I had called for help.  The whole community was deep into keeping to themselves and not getting involved.  So I suffered alone as everybody watched and pretended not to notice.\n\nSo I was really messed up in the head all through my twenties.  I was filled with rage every time I heard of someone getting rescued, saved, or helped.  I was so hateful that I wanted no-one getting help.  I didn't get any, so why should anyone else?  And that included financial, medical, emotional, any kind of help.  I didn't get any, so why should anyone get any?  I wanted the whole world to suffer as I had.\n\nSo many people don't understand that kind of rage.  It took me twenty years to get over it, and another ten to get my life straightened out.",

But you should do it for yourself because it doesn\u2019t feel good to be hateful. Hate just hurts the body. Doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be angry but you do have to be as positive as you can, for yourself more than anything because you deserve to be happy. We often don\u2019t feel like we do. \n\nOp, I think a really cool thing you can do is to trying turn that pain into creativity. You now have this capacity for pain that lets you understand others better because you know what they\u2019re going through. Use that personal knowledge to uplift others going through the same experience. Also, feel bad for your mom, but not too bad. Sometimes you gotta say I love you but fuck you. You need to be real with people. You were a fucking asshole and you hurt me and it fucked me up but I healed myself. And now I\u2019m doing you a favor. I\u2019m going to help you even though you maybe don\u2019t even deserve it. But you always always have to fight of the cynicism.

Forgiveness is a better coping mechanism though, because it doesn\u2019t lead to you turning into a piece of shit as well over time and then justifying it by having had a shitty mother. No one will care when you\u2019re your mothers age, you\u2019ll be just like mom and people will look at you the way you looked at her.",

Life ain't all peaches and cream people.... you treat your child with disrespect, expect it in return. If \"I don't know why they are like this\" is something the mom asks herself after his cold responses then she has some serious reflection to do about how she treated her son while he was going through some EXTREMELY intense situations while very young. \n\nI lost a good friend when very young. Grade 4 I think, I was so young I can't really remember much but I do remember feeling super sad and my mom and dad helping me understand and talk about it with their related experiences. Helped so much its all I can remember about the situation. The support I mean.\n\nTreat your dependents well because when ur in diapers at 85 all you will have is someone doing a job to look after you. There will be no visits at the side of your deathbed. That is reality.",

Without practice, we all suck at most things.   No one does grief \u201cwell\u201d and our abused parents didn\u2019t know how to do it either.

My dad then and my dad now are two different people. There will never be closure or retribution or fairness. Carrying this resentment only burdens you in the long run.",

I loved my kids and was afraid if I allowed them to stray at all they would be hurt. That doesn\u2019t make it right but rigid discipline was all I knew. Flash forward to today and I feel my kids keep me at a distance because of the way I raised them. After a lot of discussion with my kids I am now a lot wiser to what I did wrong. I would love to go back and change their childhood but I can\u2019t. However, I now know that the way I parented harmed my children and that has changed me.  This has helped my children heal although there are scars.  I hope you communicate with your mom about the pain she caused you, maybe it could help you both understand. Maybe she could change. I would like someone to benefit from my mistakes.",

Because you seem like a kind person, and I wouldn\u2019t want guilt to sneak up on you. I tell you this because I also wanted to punish my mother for the things she said, or did. She never got it. She just doubled down on her abuse and punished me worse. Which made me worse. It will taint your interactions with people who never even knew your mom. Try to keep your heart open, you will need it when you meet people who are worth it. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you had to go through that, and now are trying to get yourself through this. Your mom was very wrong. Unfortunately, maybe she didn\u2019t know any other way to deal with these heartbreaking situations, something has brought her there. You seem to know better. Please keep trying to be better, even if it hurts.",

It\u2019s not really my place to say however I believe your healing process from childhood trauma would probably benefit by not stooping to the behaviour that once made you feel so disheartened.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to totally suck in your frustrations from the way your mother treated you but acting this way, although it seems quite gratifying now because the gloves have changed hands.. it probably won\u2019t make you feel better in the long run and could perhaps make you even more resentful. \n\nLet it go and set yourself free.",

Heck it's entirely possible that they both feel bad but neither of them are communicating their feelings. Regardless, people are definitely making a lot of moral judgements based on their own specific experiences and beliefs with very little information on the details of their actual relationship.\n\nRevenge, kindness, forgiveness, explaining yourself, and cutting ties are all options I'm seeing people argue for but it's hard to do anything other than just share your personal beliefs when OP's explanation of the current situation is very vague.",

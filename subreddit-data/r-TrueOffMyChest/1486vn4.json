Tonight, I went to check on him before bed and he can no longer use his back legs. Tomorrow, I will give him one last bath and all the treats he deserves. I will say goodbye to the sweetest little boy and have the honor of helping him cross the rainbow bridge.",

It\u2019s not common at all for vets to euthanize their own animals because it tends to be very hard, even if they think they\u2019d prefer it. I\u2019m only a vet tech but I can\u2019t imagine being the one to actually push the drugs for any of my pets.",

He won\u2019t be scared or nervous. He will be sent to eternal playtime with dogs who will greet him with so much love. He won\u2019t be in pain or suffer ever again.

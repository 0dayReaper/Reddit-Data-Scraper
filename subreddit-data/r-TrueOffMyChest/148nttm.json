            "comment": "Sadly I miss \"This Old House\" (from the 80's early 90's) and \"Home Time\"....those two shows taught the homeowner the \"How To\" of home improvement.... Each show was a lesson in some form of technique or construction from framing to drywall plumbing electrical etc.....  Those shows were awesome and taught me so much.  I'm proud that I can say I can literally design and build a house today (I've done three) with zero education based upon knowledge I've learned from those shows and google....  Currently doing a  Salt Box to Craftsman Bungalow conversion with an addition and a big new porch.  It's all a hobby for my wife and I. We buy the ugliest cheapest house around and renovate it and rent it out...  In today's shows, I just watch them for their general design ideas and nothing more....",

Occasionally I catch This old House episodes, but that\u2019s pretty much it. \n\nSome YouTube channels are way better than the stupid overrated HGTV channel. \n\nMost of the HGTV renovation projects they show is full of crap with horrible anchors and a total waste of time. They can kiss my ass!",

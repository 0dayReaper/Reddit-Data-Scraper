    "postText": "tw of suicide in case if anyone doesn't want to read about it.  \n\n\nI've had a lot of experiences with people in my life committing suicide and I feel like this trauma is going to stick with me for the rest of my life and i'm not quite sure what to do about it. I've seen therapists and all that but it really doesn't help much.  \n\n\nMy first experience with someone committing suicide happened to me when I was just 17. I grew up in a pretty small town and had a group of friends from when I was just a little kid, before I even started grade school. There were about 6 of us who all grew up together and we were all pretty tight. About 4th grade we got a new kid in school and he quickly fell into our group. The kid who came into our group had a pretty rough life and we were all aware of it but didn't think he would do anything like what he did. One day I was at my friends house and he showed up asking my friend if he could use his gun to get rid of some badgers around his house. We showed him how to load it and shoot it and what not. We even offered to get rid of them for him but he insisted that he could take care of it. We didn't really suspect a thing. The next day we found out that he shot himself that night. The amount of guilt my friend and I felt was extreme to say the least.   \n\n\nThe next time I experienced someone taking their own life was when I was 23 and I had the misfortune of witnessing it. Total stranger but it really messed with me in a big way. I won't get too specific here, but I was talking to one of my friends when all of a sudden a guy jumped from a platform about 40 feet up, head first onto a metal deck just a few feet away from me. It was so sudden I didn't really know what had happened for a minute. This one haunts my dreams most of the time. And most of the time now days, this moment is replaced with my loved ones jumping in my dreams. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSeveral years after this my best friend took his own life in a hotel parking lot. After he died I pretty much lost it. I really couldn't function for about a year. I withdrew from society after that. Didn't want to be with anybody or do anything. I got into drugs and alcohol pretty heavily just to cope with everything. Didn't much help that I didn't have much support, or the fact I didn't really want to trauma dump on someone. So I kept to myself.   \n\n\nOnly 6 months later, to the day, another friend of mine took his life. He taught my best friend and I how to rock climb and I never in a million years would have suspected he would have done that or that he was even in that mindset. He even attended my best friends funeral. It all seemed so.. not real. He had a beautiful family. He just had a kid. Had a successful business too.   \n\n\nIt just all seems so crazy sometimes. And I have nightmares about suicide all the time. I just had one tonight actually, it's 3 in the morning and I thought maybe if I just type it out I can just \"get it off my chest\" I have been to a therapist about it but the advice that was given to me was \"You should get a pet\" I couldn't help but laugh and that was the last time I went.  \n\n\nI'm actually doing pretty okay these days. I find it funny though, that late last year I tried shrooms for the first time and I don't want to say it cured me, but holy shit if something about it worked. I haven't touched any drugs or alcohol since, or even had the desire to. However, I still don't socialize with people, which is what I'm actually afraid of for the future me. What am I going to do when I'm old and all alone. I'm okay with it now, I don't feel the need right now, but I can't help but feel this isn't sustainable for the long run. I don't have any friends anymore, and quite frankly I'm afraid to have friends. Anyway, just felt like I needed to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading if you did.",

            "comment": "I read your whole post and damn, I am so very sorry you\u2019ve experienced so many tragic losses. My heart goes out to you. I can understand why you\u2019d be afraid to make friends now, after so much trauma. I think it might be worth trying to find another therapist. Unfortunately some of them just suck and anyone who would tell you simply get a pet isn\u2019t a good fit. You need help to unpack and process all of this. I\u2019m so glad the mushrooms were helpful. The amazing thing about them is that they actually help you create new neural pathways in your brain, so they can help you heal from trauma on a physical level. Literally re-wiring your thought processes:) Have you ever looked into microdosing them? It might be worth a try! Also if you\u2019re open to it and can do so safely, mdma is incredibly healing when taken in a peaceful environment with the intention to heal trauma. \n\nI\u2019m always here if you want to chat. It\u2019s not trauma dumping to want to express what you\u2019re feeling to someone who cares. And I care.",

Some the actions you take or the way you feel about certain things will be linked to the experience/trauma. For example, I wasn\u2019t too phased from reading this, as triggering as it may be.\n\nYou might still have bad days but it gets better overtime. It may or may not go away completely. Treatment will help with this.\n\nGood luck and sorry for your losses.",

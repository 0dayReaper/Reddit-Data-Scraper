    "postText": "It started 2.5 years ago when he read a text message from an acquaintance of mine. (M)\n\nI met M off Instagram when I was doing consulting for trucking companies. He was one of the people who paid me for my time. My BF and I had a Trucking Co. It was in his name only and we grew to a decent size and M had the same size company as us just situated 1300 miles away... He asked me all kinds of questions during this 1 hour consultation. We actually had alot in common and over the last 4 years we've only helped each other in the industry nothing more nothing less. He would call me if he got cheaper fuel with a different fuel card (1 penny savings when you're doing 25 million miles a year adds up). If he found a shipper paying good prices coming out of our state (he didn't normally come here so it wasn't competition and he would pass the info on).\n\nMy BF (of 15 yrs) new I spoke to him because many times I'd talk to him in front of him or I'd even ask BF hey M has an issue with this what do you think it is... Or I'd tell him M just added 5 trucks to his fleet.. And M new about BF. In fact I called BF husband to M.\n\n2.5 years ago we sold our company and M sent me a text message on the day of the sale Saying Congratulations!!  How are you feeling? I responded with Thx! I'm nervous... \n\nWell BF read thru my text messages with M a few months later in the middle of the night. There was nothing bad mostly trucking related. He woke me up in the dead of night with some BS about me having an affair with M who is 1300 miles away. I've never met the guy. \n\nBF saw that I told him how much we sold our company for (just the gross we have a very similar company set up with assets and such and so he was curious) and the fact that I shared my \"feelings\" with M about being nervous. I did freak out and delete my messages because he turned nothing into something. I realize now I should have let him read everything but I can't bring it back. \n\nHe is absolutely relentless we go thru ups and downs the last 2 years and M's name is mentioned almost daily. I still talk to M and he knows this. I said if I'm not doing anything wrong why I should stop. \n\nAbout a month ago he checked my call records and was like who are all these people you talk to for hours at a time. I said I dunno what's the #. He says, you don't know who you talk too? I said, I talk to alot of people daily tell me the #... Mom.... Aunt.... Dad..... ok who's this # you called 180 x this month I'm like what??? He shows me and I have no clue as I've never called that #. I call Verizon and it's someone using my # as a spammer... He finds M's # and sees I haven't talked to him for over a month and half... \n\nYou would think this would prove it. Nope he says you must be talking to him via whatsapp. No im not. \n\nHe has called me every name in the book. He doesn't trust me, tells people I help another man build his business while ours went to shit. Which It did not go to shit we sold and made money off it. \n\nHe resents me for making him sell the company. It was litterally killing me. I just turned 40 and I am in full menopause due to the stress of the business over the last 13 years. \n\nLast night was the last straw. He truly hurt me as I have been nothing but loyal, loving and hardworking. \n\nHe asked me in front of his friend if we split up will you give me a percentage of your company (I opened a freight Brokerage 8 months ago that is doing well, he has another Trucking Co with 3 trucks and its doing well). I paused because I had to think about this... \n\nIf... we... split... up... will I give him a percentage of MY company? Because I paused he unleashed an arsenal of attacks on me and my character and was like you just put the nail in the coffin... Oh it's on and his friend was like wtf... He said your company must be doing very well if he's reacting like that. I was like wait a min so if we split you have your Co and I have mine.. Why would you want/ need a piece if mine? He didn't listen...  You bitch oh I got your # you said it was not our company you said your company.. I gave you 50% of my company we sold. I said I work 2x harder than you. You were drinking at the bar when I begged and cried for you to help me... \n\nI grabbed our son and went home. His friends thanked me for keeping it classy. \n\nHe didn't come home until 7am and he woke me up telling me I'm a whore. A silent killer.. Oh you've planned this. You were gonna leave me this whole effin time. You made me sell my company just for you to leave me. Build up your company and leave me. WTF\n\nI dont know what to do. Our son is 11 and his father is starting to say shit around him about me having another boyfriend. That I'm helping him build his company so I can run off with him. The man is married with 4 kids. (I know I know it happens but definitely not in this situation)\n\nHe is delusional and I just don't know what to do anymore. \n\nI ... Need ... Advice ...",

            "comment": "Sadly, sometimes when a SO accuses their partner of cheating or deception whiteout a rational reason, its because they are the one being deceitful. Was he acting strange before accusing you of all this? \n\nBecause a relationship of 15 years with children just doesn\u2019t implode like that over money and some messages that he knows about. At that point in time, you should be on the same wavelength. If he makes you the villain for cheating and some sort of financial abuse (?!), then he absolves himself for his \u201cmistake\u201d. Because one is less then two. Don\u2019t let him convince you of that! \nSelling the business and each making a new one sounds like it was the right move. Now that I think about it, his business might not be doing well if you did 150% of the work in the first business and that\u2019s why he has to bring you down. He can\u2019t stand your succes.",

                    "comment": "Emma,  I responded in length to another's post giving more insight and you actually hit the nail on the head. His success was because of me. So yes, I started my own company because I did not want my income and success to be attached to another. I did everything for that business while raising a child and a man child (atleast my opinion). But I still run his trucking company along side of mine. The difference now is he actually has to drive one of the trucks because we haven't found a qualified driver for it. So he is mad at me by saying I sold \"My Company\" to drive an effin truck. I'm almost 50 and I'm going in reverse. Wtf how is that reverse? You started a new company and you have 3 trucks now. As a business owner you have to do everything and anything to get the job done. This is what it requires of you in this moment. When we had the large company it required me to work 7am to 7pm. I did it. And when I needed to do the accounting I was working until 10/ 11 at night for weeks at a time. But I did. I didn't complain. \n\nWhen he comes home from being on the truck off to his friends he goes. The bar, their house and coming home late. I've asked him for years can you come home at a decent hour so you don't wake me in the middle of the night?! Has he listened? No.",

You seem to own a business yet this other business was causing your stress. I don't get it. Something just doesn't add up. \n\nAnd if you did split up, if he helped you build this business why wouldn't you pay out? If you did all the work yourself that's one thing, but it sounds like you profited from selling the business he built, that you helped in and for whatever reason was too much for you. Did he want to sell it or did you convince him to sell it? It sounds like you justified it by saying \"we made money from the sale\" but the ends may not have justified the means here. Your perception of reality may differ from his on the nature of the business sale. \n\nYour biggest mistake was deleting those messages. It screams of covering up. If you really had nothing to hide here you shouldn't have deleted them.  If you really are innocent then maybe it's time to leave, because when he asked you about the business and you hesitated it might be speaking volumes as to where your head space is currently at.",

It sounds like the bf has gone off the deep end, but why in the world wouldn't you cut contact with someone you have never met after you deleted those messages if your bf was uncomfortable.  Something in OP story just isn't adding up here. Most people in a 15 year relationship don't just start accusing their SO of cheating unless something else was triggering it.  I'd like to hear the bf's version.",

                    "comment": "We were dating when he said started the business so we did it together. He taught me all he knew in the business and I took it to another level. I used to work 70 hours a week. The business was too much for both of us. At one point he checked out and left me to run it. I had no choice but to continue. We would have lost everything if I checked out too. Trucking is not easy. It is 24/7 365 days a year with no vacations. Calls all hours of the day and night and liability like you wouldn't believe. It was way too stressful. The stress started Messing with my health. I begged him to step up his game to releive some of the stress off my shoulders. Also in this time frame we had back to back DOT audits. One in Feb of 19 and MArch of 20. I handle the audits. And during that we also had an IFTA audit with the state and an IRS audit all a the same dam time. And of course I handled all of it while continuing to run the business. \n\nI gave him an ultimatum because I just couldn't do it anymore. Find someone to replace me or sell the business. We decided to sell. It took 2 years. Finally sold in 21. Because he was the CEO he was let go 1 mon after sale. Because I was the backbone of the company I had to put another 8 months in. \n\nAfter my 8 months. I took a year off. He had started another Trucking Co In this time frame and once again I kept it running because he was partying... living it up.... coming home all hours of the night. Leaving the house at 10/11 in the morning and home by 1/2 am. This time though it was only 1 truck opposed to 22. So it wasn't so bad. \n\nAfter the one year i started a freight Brokerage because there were some customers of ours that the new company owners did not take on.  I started the Company because truthfully I did not want to go down the route of owning a trucking company again. I thought if I could grow this company and make a comfortable living then we could get rid of the trucks for good. \n\nHe has yet to help me with the company. I do it all. He has not put anything into this company. I am running his and mine. I had asked him quite a few times to find the loads for his truck and refused. He also says he would help me with my business if it gets to a certain point. But how could I trust he would actually help if he always left me to do everything. \n\nI have resentment due to his lack of work ethic and he has resentment because he feels like I forced him to sell a business that was making good money. In reality though trucking has high highs and low lows. The way the market is right now we probably would have lost everything. We would have Had to sell everything just to stay afloat and it's not the first time. That beast of a business was litterally killing me. \n\nI should not of deleted the messages your right. And yes if it was Making him uncomfortable I should of stopped talking to him. But I don't talk often and when I do it is trucking related. He has the same argument but when he doesn't come home and I call him he sneaks to a bathroom to talk to me. Is this suspicious. Yes. Do I ask him why he does that? Yes. His answer is because the bar is loud. I choose to trust him because I know him and don't actually think he's cheating on me. But he refuses to stop and says I don't need a mother.. So if he knows I don't like it why does he continue?",

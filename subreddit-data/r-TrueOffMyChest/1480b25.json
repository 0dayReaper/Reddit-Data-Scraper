    "postText": "I'm (M21) in a relationship with a girl for six years. After these years of a happy relationship we came to a point, at least from my point of view, that our relationship became so cold. \nRecently i've met a girl that is everything i've ever dreamed of. I feel amazing with her. Last week she told me that she fell in love with me. All this leads to me being a complete mess and feeling trapped and like a p.o.s. \nMy gf has been such a huge part of my life that I can't just let her go like that. She's such an angel and i know she still loves me the same. I don't feel the same anymore. The worst thing is that she unoficially became a part of my family and i've became a part of hers. My mother and grandparents treat her almost like if she was their own child. Everyone thinks that we have a perfect relationship and that we will get married in the future.\n\nI know deep inside I need a change in my life, because this just feels wrong and i'm not happy anymore and I've fell in love with the other girl too. I just can't erase my gf from my life. I don't even know how because I don't want to hurt her. It would feel like losing a family member and i'm scared that my family isn't going to welcome the other girl like they welcomed my gf. Also the fact that i've spent such a huge part of my life with her makes me feel like i'd have to erase all those memories because I don't want them to become bittersweet.. \n\nIf there's someone going through something like this too I wish you to find happiness in this confusing life.",

            "comment": "you're way too young to be trapped in a relationship. \n\nhowever, i don't advise leaving your gf *solely* because you vibe with another woman. given the fact you consider your gf to be a part of the family - that would be cold as fuck. \n\nmy advice would be to tell the new woman that you cannot disrespect the woman who has been with you for 6 years. that's off the table... for now.\n\nyou need to have a frank discussion with your gf, AND your family, that you no longer want to continue the relationship. keep everything on respectful and considerate terms. \n\nonce the dust has settled - have at it, go date whoever you want. but take care of business first like a man - don't go being disrespectful like a horny lil boy (no offense meant - the fact you are seeking advice is already a sign of maturity and being considerate, so keep that energy)",

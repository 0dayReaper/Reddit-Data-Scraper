But this is the first and largest event of this kind that I've ever seen. It gives me hope that one day as many people will come together to save our planet and our people as did to save our toilet time waster. And for that, I think we should all be proud.",

But I believe in my heart that as many people as there are supporting the blackout, there's just as many trying to save the planet.",

That's how you force change in a free market economy. Pretty much the same for most things, really. Stop supporting (and making excuses for supporting) anything, and once enough people do said thing will either change or die off.",

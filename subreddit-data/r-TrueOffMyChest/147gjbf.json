I hate life, I hate paying bills, I hate working a dead end job to pay the mounted bills, I hate the fake people around me, I hate the fake idea of true love (been in abusive relationships), I hate lies, I hate secrets, I hate scum, I hate disloyal people, I hate those who put others down, I hate people who exclude others because they don\u2019t fit in their group, I hate people who do shit behind their partners back and hide stuff, I hate cheats. I hate fake shit.",

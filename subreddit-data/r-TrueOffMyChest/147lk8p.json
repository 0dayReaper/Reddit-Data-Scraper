I found his facebook and when I was going through it although not much was posted I saw a ring and I thought it was a friend who was recently engaged. As I was scrolling through the comments I learned rather quickly that I was wrong so I Texted my sister and she had no idea and I don\u2019t know if I should ask about the engagement to me. Honestly it creeps me out how she has my name and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with her around. I\u2019m thinking about cutting him off completely.",

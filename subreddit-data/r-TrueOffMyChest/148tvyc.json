    "postText": "Hi! Back story we haven\u2019t been together for more than a year. My entire pregnancy was kinda just chaos I lived in Florida w fam and he lived in New York. Fast forward I had our son, and when he first came to visit after a week he was born his dad (BD\u2019s dad) called and asked about his previous son from another relationship because his birthday had recently passed. Our kids have birthday a week apart. He didn\u2019t mention our kid. This made me furious. My family contributed to whether it be diapers, a car seat even just to check on me and him after labor. Not his family. This turned into a argument and time has passed he told me some bs about he won\u2019t tell his family because our relationship failed and they won\u2019t be able to see him due to distance so he doesn\u2019t want to tell them yada yada yada. 4 months later. He is visiting his grandma called and asked about his other son and he did not mention our baby yet again. He even went as far as to put the pillow over his head so maybe she didn\u2019t hear the baby (assumption). So I let the baby cry and he walked out the room to talk in the bathroom. Is that shit now weird????? Like??? We have been trying to work on being together but wtf. I guess I\u2019m venting but that made me want him to go back to New York. He threatened my life would be crap as a single mom but tbh my family will always be there for me and little man so idk. Am I an ass because now I feel like..I should curse him out. (Sorry a lot of this was me venting) I can go further into details if you ask I guess",

Do you not realize you deserve better? (And your child does too!)\n4. Tell him to go home. Move on with your life. Do what it takes to give your child the best possible life. If you don't have a good career, get going on schooling NOW. Now that you are a single mom, you'll probably qualify for lots of grants. \n5. He \"should\" pay support, but I'd be willing to bet that he doesn't have a job or if he does, not a good job.\n6. He's not telling his family because he's ashamed. He already has a child that he is not being a 100% dad to, and now he has another. His family is going to be pissed and disappointed. Do you want to be with someone who is ashamed?",

                    "comment": "Wow I just got into myself and said the exact same thing on my drive around just now. I needed to think clearly. This was confirmation. He hasn\u2019t really been stable since we\u2019ve been together. A lot of that he blames on me because he wanted to move in together before but it just never works out and I felt we just met so it was just a lot especially knowing he has a kid. We argue too much for me to feel comfortable leaving florida and going to my w him alone (I have family there but my mom lives here). Lots of red flags but I take accountability for ignoring them, there was plenty. He quit his electrician job in ny to come out here Mother\u2019s Day and hasn\u2019t left. This is the first time he\u2019s supported since my baby has been born. I was on maternity leave since January so I wasn\u2019t working and really needed help. I got hired at a really good job working with radioactive materials as a tech and it pays well. I\u2019ll be in nursing school god willing next spring I graduated the month I got pregnant last year. I\u2019m really trying to solidify myself and I was before I even met him. \n\nHe\u2019s having me pay him back for helping me and send him back since I guess he spent his savings. Inconsiderate knowing I haven\u2019t worked or that he should help his son without wanting something back. So I am absolutely sending him home. We do deserve better.",

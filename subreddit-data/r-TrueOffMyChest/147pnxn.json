    "postText": "Basically about a week ago now my mother told me that my grandfather was diagnosed with serious cancer in his stomach and won't be with us for much longer. Upon hearing this news I didn't really feel anything, I knew I should feel sad and did a little bit but honestly I mostly just felt indisposed and was more angry than upset at the news (the circumstances of his diagnosis were pretty surprising given we were all under the assumption he was fine and would be out of hospital soon). My brother on the other hand seemed extremely upset and had tears in his eyes but I didn't even feel close to crying? It's not like I'm someone that never cries either I've cried at bloody tv shows before. It's also not like I'm not that close with him either, prior to his hospital stint me and my brother were pretty much seeing him every week and had been for the past year or so. For a bit I was concerned that there was maybe something seriously wrong with me like potentially being a sociopath but I don't think that's the case as as previously mentioned I have cried at many things and been upset at the misfortune of others or however you want to put it. I've seen him twice since his diagnosis including today and both times I didn't really feel that upset, today I maybe was a bit more as his condition has gone down hill pretty quickly and seeing him struggling to even stand did upset me but still nowhere close to the point of tears. Even now thinking about it I almost feel indisposed or like it doesn't feel like it's really happening. I have even tried to make myself feel more upset about it by thinking about it and what would happen when he dies but at most I just feel a little sad about it. Is this a normal thing to happen or is there something actually wrong with me?",

    "postText": "First, it was for minor things that wouldn't make a difference. Then a couple major things. Now I'm bending the truth to my advantage and I only feel slightly guilty.\n\nFor instance, the other day, I was trying to convince my Discord friend to buy me a game. I'm not poor but dollars are a lot in my currenccy so I twisted the tooth that I was poor, in comparison to the avergae American. In the end, I realized what I was doing was wrong so I just bought it. Still expensive but I no longer had any guilt about it. \n\nI think I'm starting to become a habitual liar. Gotta learn to take the shame and blame again.",

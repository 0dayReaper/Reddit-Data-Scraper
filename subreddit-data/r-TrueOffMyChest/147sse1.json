    "postText": "I, (17M) had a S.A experience which I still haven't gotten over it till date ..\n\nJust  about 2   years  ago, a mate of mine in the hostel  Let's call him Ice was weirdly obsessed with me for some reason I don't know. We rarely talked of course because he didn't run in the same circles as I did. I don't know how this happened because we all grew up together though we weren't friends .\n\n     He is not the type of guy anyone would expect to do that .He has a gf, his cool friends gang and all that straight popular guys all do. While me in contrast is kinda the very opposite \"not liked and outcasted by my mates due to weird rumors and plain homophobia not that \" I am gay for the record\"\n\n       So Ice basically did all kinds of shit like ogling, grope me  repeatedly and then proceed to attack and belittle me  at any chance he got that made me feel so fucking uncomfortable. At first I dismiss it as a mere joke that was untill an certain incident happened that he bullied me : \"tore my bread into pieces in front of me\" for no reason at all \n     \n    I can't even explain all the messed up things he did and I don't know if you understand but everyday I woke up paranoid of what Ice will do next to me and played numb to all that.\n\n   Let just say I would have forgotten it if I  didn't have to remember that \"creepy ass smirk\" he had all the time while ogling without shame or groping me. It kinda sent the message \"I can do anything I want with you, and you can't do anything about it\" and I hated to admit that he was right and I was totally helpless given my situation  at  large . Fun fact is that I thought I was delusional about the whole incident and repeatedly gaslighting myself that maybe this guy was just joking around or I am taking this way too seriously. That was until the bread situation!!\n\n    Funny enough he didn't even apologize. After that \"tearing of bread into pieces\" incident, he just stopped me that  night to shake my hand..I don't know if that is bro code for apology .\n\n   It's not about the fucking bread!! It is the fact of how weak and pathetic I felt when he did that and couldn't stand for myself cuz everyone else will support him .To rub salt into the injury my so called friends had a group meeting with me on how I should have stood up for myself and fought him. And what did I do to offend him so bad cuz the reaction was weird. \n\n      And in the evening when I made a promise to myself to stand up for myself in the future..Fate decided to played a cruel game with me that evening. \n\n     It was common for guys to go fetch water downstairs for the evening bath. I decided to help a junior friend of mine who was sick to do that. It was a long queue with junior guys. Normally seniors jump the queue for that but I decided not to ( Wrong choice by the way).  And that got me trapped cuz Ice also happened to join the queue as well..  I tried jumping the queue to avoid him but Ice stop that and said of course the right thing to do is to lead by example and wait and the juniors agree with him. While we were both in the line and before I knew it.  He started repeatedly groping me down my ass .. I tried turning back  and signalling but no one of course noticed.  That was until I stared him down with hate in my eyes and luckily that made him uncomfortable and he told the juniors to allow me to fetch my bucket and leave......  That made me realized that maybe I wasn't being delusional or overreacting and This guy is really doing all this on purpose.  And waves of guilt and self hate flooded my mind and I hate myself for not protecting myself enough and be pathetic enough to be picked on like that \n\n   After I left that environment,I continue to obsessed about those stuffs until I saw him again for a moment which weirdly made me stop obsessing about it temporarily \n\n    And I can't tell anyone cuz I am afraid they won't take it seriously or just dismiss it. And I also come from a pretty very religious country so you can only imagine.\n     \n      I feel that I can't trust anyone really, the few people I told just plainly dismissed it as I am a guy and didn't really take it seriously.. Almost like I am overreacting which I knew I wasn't back then. \n   \nAnd back then I just wanted to tell someone, anyone but Alas I couldn't find the courage to even do that..\n \n   Even the option of therapy won't even solve that because I don't even believe in such and we'll it's not practiced over here by the way.\n\n   I still feel that I lost my innocence and can never be the same and I hold it against him but I  am trying to forgive him for all that.",

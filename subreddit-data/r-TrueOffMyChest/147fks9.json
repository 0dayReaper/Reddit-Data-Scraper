    "postText": "This is sad because i\u2019m only 16. I was in one relationship that lasted a year when i was 14, and she ended up emotionally manipulating me into things that i did not want to do/gaslighting me into thinking all our problems were my fault etc\u2026. i\u2019ve mostly recovered from that trauma and since then i had confessed to two other people. The first girl is one of my friends, who simply didn\u2019t have interest in me. the second is recent. i told her i had feelings for her and we went on a date. things felt so off even though we were friends previously. i had such high hopes just for her to tell me she\u2019d get back to me on monday, essentially rejecting the idea of us dating. i respect her as a person and i\u2019m completely okay with that, but i know it will take me a bit to heal as i am truly in love w her. it feels like i can\u2019t find anyone who loves other people like i do and even though i\u2019m so young i\u2019m already losing hope. i have many friends who love me very much and i love them too, but romantically? i feel completely hopeless.",

            "comment": "So this is going to suck to hear because everyone always says this when young people have something troubling them but mate - you are SO young!! I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve already had to go through a manipulative relationship at your age, that sounds truly terrible. If you can, try to get some therapy to talk that relationship out with someone. Don\u2019t let it become formative for how you view love and/or yourself. Their gaslighting behaviour only says something about what kind of person THEY are, not who or what you are. The right person will come along, maybe soon, maybe in a few years after you\u2019ve dated a few \u201cwrong persons\u201d you thought were right at first. No one is unlovable, you just had two dates that didn\u2019t end up turning into relationships even though you wished they would. And while that totally sucks and hurts, it\u2019s normal and all part of the process. It doesn\u2019t mean anything about YOU. Sorry if this is written in a weird way, I\u2019m on my way to work and haven\u2019t truly woken up yet. I wish you all the best, you sound like someone with a lot of love to give and will make someone feel very lucky to be with you one day!",

Getting a girlfriend should be the least of your concerns right now. Explore hobbies, read books, play video games, focus on your schoolwork, and have fun with your friends. These are the things you'll cherish when you're older. Also, this is just my personal opinion, but I don't think people should date until they're around 19 or 20. At 16, your world is still quite small, and it's almost impossible to have a healthy relationship when the only people you interact with are immature and insecure.",

    "postText": "So I 15m have a best friend 15 f. When we got into highschool we went through a little \"oh we grown now\" phase where we did some mildly bad stuff like skipped class and vaped/drank a little. Now she's gone a tiny bit off the rails and it is beginning to be too much for me. Here are some examples of all the things she's now done.\n\n1. Had public sex in a stolen car in front of a cop with an adult man.\n2. cheated on every boyfriend she had.\n3. sent nudes to a really pervy teacher for bette grades\n4. snuck out of the house to go to a party with mostly college kids and did coke off/ sucked a guy's penis, this guy happened to be the boyfriend of her ex close friend (the reason her friend dropped her is because her current boyfriend used to be her ex friend's boyfriend but cheated on the friend with her. so she home-wrecked 2 of her ex best friend's relationships) oh and this was all recorded\n5. she pretended to be a trans girl and had sex with men on grindr for money.\n6. she planted cp on her friends dad at a sleepover.\n7. she cut said friend at the sleepover\n8. she helped her friends jump her own sister\n9. she burnt down a house (it was abandoned but it was still dangerous)\n10. she tried to start a meth lab in my garage\n11. she hired an escort to go to a friends house to make it look like the dad was cheating\n12. she started selling alcohol to minors\n13. she started an onlyfans\n14. she gave 2 people chlamydia\n15. her rice purity score is 15\n16. she stole a baby\n17. she tried to mug a middle aged mom and a grandma with her friend\n18. she robbed multiple gas stations and stores\n19. she started her many of her own businesses (having sex for cheap liquor (so she got it for free) and selling it at extremely high prices to middle/upper class kids that have no access to alc, and jumping and attacking people and businesses and having them pay for her and her friend to stop.)\n20. payed homeless people money to fight which caused one of them to die\n21. pushed a guy onto the train tracks\n22. started crocheting\n23. lied about her age and started bartending and dancing at a shady club\n24. she got kids sick/ sent to the hospital because she sold them powdered sugar mixed with chalk as cocaine, oregano as weed, and rubbing alc mixed with water as vodka.\n25. she started selling actual drgs\n26. planted drugs on a teacher\n27. shanked a kid when she was walking out of school because the kid owed her money\n28. ran away from home multiple times\n29. assisted in many armed house robberies\n30. got her uncle sent to a maximum security prison   \n\nso yea i just feel like she's doing some dangerous things that can hurt her. IDK what I should do. I worry about her a lot and feel like this isn't a safe way to live. surprisingly she hasn't been arrested or sent to juvie yet and honestly as bad is it sounds i think she needs to be arrested as like a wake up call.  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

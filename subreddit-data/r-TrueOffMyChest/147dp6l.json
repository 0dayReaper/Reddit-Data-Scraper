    "postText": "I had a wrestless spirit as a new mother. It was broken by the love my son brought to this world. The smiles he brought to family, friends, strangers...so much love. It clung to me like a film of iridescence and lifted every part of my life. My outward appearance had a glow, long after maternity had ended. It was the love in my life. I had true love radiating off my skin.\n\nWith care, effort and good intention that love could have lasted forever and cloaked our lives in beauty.\n\nUnfortunately I chose a soul-sucking, half-ass excuse for a piece of shit asshole for my sons fatherr. Yea, I really fucked up this time guys. And now I'm 25 years in. \n\nI knew it was a sham on the third night home with the baby. He asked if we could go love with relatives for a few months, \"until you get his sleep pattern down. You have 8 weeks off, I still have to go to work every day.\" \n\nNo, you fucking twit. We will NOT be staying anywhere else. Its been a decline since then and one calamity after another.\n\nEvery step of the fucking way has been a struggle. Even if he had to make sure we felt it himself, we felt some struggle. Every easy happiness has been stolen by his ignorance and short-sighted way of life.\n\nOur lives could have been so much more beaitiful.",

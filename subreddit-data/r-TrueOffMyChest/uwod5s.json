    "postText": "I know it seems like a dumb thing to end my marriage over. But after dealing with this for so long I\u2019m finally done. \n\nMy wife and I are both in our 30s. We have a daughter. My wife has always been pretty into appearances but it was never that bad. She just wanted things to look nice when people came over. \n\nThen she started a Instagram page for moms and got a massive amount of followers, about 400 thousand since our daughter was born. Ever since then I feel like I don\u2019t live in a house I live in an Instagram photo shoot. There can\u2019t be any proof we actually live here. My wife stresses so much about things looking good that she doesn\u2019t actually enjoy the moment. She started a fight with me right after our daughter took her first steps because I had put my drink down on the table behind her and it\u2019s \u201call she could see\u201d and how she\u2019d need to edit it out of the video. She called me a selfish prick for putting my drink down on a coffee table to watch my daughter take her first steps. \n\nOur daughters bedroom is just a mass of beige and cream, there\u2019s barely any toys in it which was fine while our daughter was small but now she\u2019s getting older. My wife refuses to buy her any toys that don\u2019t match her \u201caesthetic\u201d My mother took my daughter to the store and let her pick out a toy, she picked out this doll house from this show she watches, she got all of the dolls and furniture, and my wife told her she had to keep it at my mothers house because there was \u201cno place for it at home\u201d (she absolutely had room for it). \n\nMy wife is convinced I\u2019m leaving for another woman, I\u2019m having an affair, etc, but I\u2019m not. I just can\u2019t keep feeling like I live in a museum where I can\u2019t touch or move anything, I can\u2019t even build a blanket fort with my kid without my wife flipping out that they\u2019re \u201cdecorative blankets\u201d that she had folded a special way. I\u2019m not going to force my daughter to live in an \u201caesthetic\u201d.\n\nEditing in, i\u2019ve tried to encourage her to seek professional help, she insists this isn\u2019t a problem and she doesn\u2019t need any therapy.",

All of the \u201chappy moments\u201d were fake. The kids were mad posing for picture after picture. She would hide the mess, bribe them with treats, get the perfect curated picture for her feed, then proceed to ignore them and interact with her followers. It blew my mind to see the behind the scenes of what looked like a picture perfect life. At least by leaving her, half of the time let\u2019s hope, she can actually be allowed to be a messy kid who has some fun \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f",

Her mom bought her a fancy, very over the top hot chocolate that had candy canes, a mountain of whipped cream and marshmallow snowman, sprinkles, etc. The little girl was so excited but the mom had her posing for several pictures with it and at the end the girl only had enough energy to keep fake smiling as the hot chocolate melted. Then she and the mom had a sip of it and threw it out as it was all melted and not impressive looking any more. Then the mom sat there, using her phone while ignoring her daughter who started climbing over the decorations, I\u2019m assuming to post on social media. It was very sad to witness.",

Just use it selfishly. Turn off notifications, forget any notion of clout. Take pictures for the love of photography and the sake of your own memories.

Sit on a rock in the middle of the woods with a Nintendo Switch and a backup battery so you can stay for hours. \n\nThis\u2026 might be different for people without ADHD. But I do feel like, at the end of the day, it\u2019s not about *what* you\u2019re doing or *what* you\u2019re using, nearly as much as *how* and *why*. People in Jesus\u2019 time flaunted their wealth by donating to temples and used displays of religious faith to get attention. People in the 1970s were using analog cameras and slide projectors as their equivalent of an Instagram feed, with delayed gratification but the same shallow motivations and lack of appreciation for the moment. People in every era have assigned value to things from far-away places because being able to visit or trade with them was a sign of status. Social media is creating a few new shitty behaviors, but it\u2019s also enabling old ones to be indulged in faster and more often.",

We went to the most famous crepe house in Quebec City once. She took one photo of each person\u2019s crepe because they were beautiful. Mine had a bite out of it and I was holding a fork in the photo. Know why that\u2019s fine? Because it\u2019s part of the memory! That fancy hot chocolate I ordered? Oh yeah the photo of it is a little blurry as I\u2019m lifting it for a repeated sip. That made it on my Instagram; because it\u2019s the fun of the moment. It\u2019s not about the perfect life. It\u2019s my life. \n\nSide note: I\u2019m a photographer and while I prefer nature over portraits, I always find candid photos are better. Sure, staged ones are fine for like a family get together, but last family gathering I spent twenty minutes just walking along the sidelines and not disturbing anyone while I took photos. They actually have memories attached (Jenny was saying this, Erica was laughing so hard here, etc). The only person who I would say I even came remotely close to inconveniencing or focusing on was my aunt, but that\u2019s only because she doesn\u2019t have long left so us having some photos of her on professional equipment taken not long before she passed but also not completely consumed by the disease will be valuable someday. \n\nTLDR: staged shit drives me mad. There\u2019s a reason why actual photographer\u2019s work looks better over everyone with an iPhone in portrait mode. They know when to let the moment play out. As such, live in the moment. The photos will be nice, but unless you\u2019ve hired a photographer to follow you around, focus on the memories",

Victims of abuse are hurt not just by the abuser, but also from everyone who turned their back and didn't help them get out.",

So unless the parents go through a very long, drawn out court proceeding that involves court appointed investigative reporting, the child's wants will mean nothing.  Unless the mother actually listens to the child, but based on this post and my own personal experiences, that will not be the case. Losing your kid doesn't really fit that perfect home aesthetic.",

I used to be on a dating website and a woman my age (at the time) had posted a selfie for her profile.

He just sort of existed.\n\nAnyway, I was one of the few over 18 workers (I was 19), and I was treated like shit by these two. To the point I was getting screamed at directly in my ear at random as either of them would walk up on me and find something wrong with what I was doing, and start shoving me around yelling in my face and throwing things at me. The breaking point was when the assistant manager straight up attacked me and threw punches and all his little followers jumped in on the attack. When he realized he went too far, he told everyone to run and they all hid. If I had caught him that night I would have gone to jail because none of the witnesses would have sided with me out of fear of reprisal from the creepy management. I bailed but had one or two contacts over there so I heard what happened next.\n\nNow what does all this violent shit have to do with the creepy couple?\n\nSimple. That violence is what the assistant manager did to the underaged female staff when they refused their advances or turned 18. Including one 15 year old the assistant manager decided to violently sexually assault in the breakroom. He tore her clothes and started beating her to the point paramedics came. They put a warrant out for his arrest because he apparently exited out the back door when he saw the police arrive. I was told her shirt was partially torn off and they had to put a blanket over her. He never returned to work after that. Can't imagine why.\n\nThe head creep still worked there when the two contacts I had there left because they got tired of his shit, namely because he started chasing off anyone who was over 18 claiming he cared about the safety of the younger female crew members. LOL. Head creep never did anything as overt as his buddy. His myspace only was friended with 13-17 year old girls who worked there.\n\n\nFuck these people.",

I wish it weren't true but it is. I take an insane amount of pictures of my son but I use a album app that has an account that only my family and close friends can access. No one else needs to see pictures of my son. I don't care wtf that random person from high-school that I haven't thought about in 15 years thinks about my life.\n\nEta: omg I just clicked the link and I am horrified. Not only are they selling pictures of underage girls they are dressed semi inappropriately. I'm all for letting people dress how they want but not a girl under 13 in a picture being sold to some creep. And I have experience of a creep having a picture of me in his house...it's not a good feeling. And then to have that girls MEASUREMENTS along with the photo... WHY!?!?! At this point is like you are specifically targeting pedos. I pray to God those girls are alright and stay safe. That is absolutely disgusting\n\n2nd edit: grammar",

She is narcissistic and putting her own need to be liked and followed over her families happiness. And if she's not willing to go to therapy, much less *acknowledge* that she is prioritizing things over her family, then moving on is the correct course of action. If she isn't shocked into realizing her actions have hurt her family by you leaving, then nothing will change her. \n\nWhich brings me to the point that I would much rather watch a \"mommy blogger\" talk about substantive issues like working through a divorce, burning tonight's dinner and having to order out at the last minute, struggling to make it all work and balance everything, financial struggles, feeling burnt out, the emotional toll that being a parent brings, etc than a perfectly curated house of lies. \n\nGood luck to you OP. Your daughter will thank you when she's older.",

Record conversations you have with her.  Depending on what state you live in, only one party, you, needs to know you are recording. When you file for custody, she'll invariably claim abuse. Document, photograph, etc. Save receipts, if you give her money, give her a check or money order, not cash. And don't leave the house.\n\nEdit:. Also take screenshots of her Instagram feed. It will be difficult to near impossible to get her feed without a subpoena in the future, and even with a subpoena.  Screen shot her social media posts/feed and keep a notebook with dates matching up her posts to things she did or did not do for your daughter. You are your daughter's only defense against her mom's mental abuse and not letting her be a kid. Start documenting now!!  It will impossible once you start legal action because she'll start blocking and hiding and shading the truth for litigation purposes.",

They need to roll on the floor, jump off furniture, play in the mud and just be children, learning about the world from the adults in their lives. Social media is just so toxic, photoshopping themselves (and environmental) trying to convince everyone, including themselves, that their life is something to envy. \n\nOP, your daughter deserves more than to be a prop for your wife to display. Let her be messy, spilling crumbs on the floor, get a dog so the dog can eat those spilled crumbs. Life is for living",

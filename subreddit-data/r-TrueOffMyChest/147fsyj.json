    "postText": "Last night I was watching tv with my window open, just enjoying the breeze. I listened to sirens go by and stop, I thought maybe there was a fire, a car accident, something. I listened to the sprinklers turn on at 9:00pm. It felt like 15 minutes after I heard a man start yelling for help, his voice was so strong and he sounded close by. At his second call it sounded like he\u2019d been cut off, a half cry for help. I put on my slippers and didn\u2019t bother putting pants on, just ran out in the cold and listened. For two, maybe three minutes it was silent, then I heard him again, but he sounded farther this time, weaker maybe. I ran as fast as I could down the street, listening, watching, waiting for any sound or a light, some kind of signal to say where he was. I heard him call a few more times but stood frozen, I couldn\u2019t tell what direction it was coming from. I wanted to yell back \u201cwhere are you\u201d but was too afraid I\u2019d miss his next call if I did so. I stood out there waiting for a few minutes trying to think of what to do, do I call the cops? It was a windy day, what if the wind was carrying sound from farther away. What would I tell them? Someone was crying for help but I couldn\u2019t tell where they are and I couldn\u2019t hear them anymore? I kept thinking about how his last cry sounded so far away, and like he\u2019d choked it out. I heard sirens again but just for a second this time, and saw a fire truck and ambulance driving away further down my street, the opposite direction. I went back inside, told my mum what had happened and she said it was probably fine now. I laid awake all night hoping that he was ok. \n\nThis morning I got a notification from my local news center that a man had died only 5 houses down from me, he\u2019d been hit by a car on his bike and flown off it, then rolled down into a creek bed. It said he was pronounced dead at 9:14 pm at the scene. I keep trying to convince myself that there wasn\u2019t anything I could\u2019ve done but I still feel guilty, that I should\u2019ve called out for him and maybe he would\u2019ve lived. Even if he didn\u2019t, that he wouldn\u2019t be alone. But the fire truck was already there down the loop, I\u2019d heard them earlier. I still can\u2019t logic it out of my head that I couldn\u2019t have done anything. I heard the sprinklers again tonight, 9:00 pm. I\u2019m laying here with my window open, sobbing violently because I thought I heard him again. I didn\u2019t know him, didn\u2019t even recognize his name. But I\u2019m still laying here crying because I heard his last cries for help, and did nothing about it.",

            "comment": "Wow OP. I think you may not know this, but there is a \"crowd effect\" in psychology, people tend to not act on cried for help etc when they know others will hear them too, because they think those other people will act. It was theorized after a woman was raped and murdered in front of her building, it lasted for a long time, the attacker had time to leave and come back to kill her, most of the people heard her, but noone helped or even called the cops.\n\nWhat you did was brave. You were not just passive. You took actions. There is a saying \"you never know how you'll react until you are faced with that extreme situation\". Well now, you know what you're made of. You are the kind of person that steps up and takes action.\n\nAs for the poor man, it sounds like he survived the crash for only 3-4minutes. If you had found him and called 911, he may have survived a bit longer because they would have directed you to try and contain the hemorragy, but with this kind of injuries and death happening so fast, the ambulance wouldn't have had enough time to get there and get him back to the hospital. Plus then, getting to the hospital doesn't mean he would have been saved.\n\nI am so sorry you had to live this because you will feel guilty for not finding him, that's understandable. Even if just so he wouldn't die alone. But there is nothing you could have done. Especially without pants on, you couldn't even garrot a wound!",

Turns out that the inquiries, investigation, and multiple write-ups in psychology journals and textbooks were not based on the actual incident, but on the NYT article's *report* of it, which was basically fiction as far as the existence of any bystanders was concerned.\n\nStill, it's real: one should never shout \"Call 911!\" into the air and expect anyone to do it; instead single a person out and tell *them specifically* to call.",

Yet he, who was a few streets away, was the first there, none of the inhabitants reacted. (He was with friends, they restrained the rapist while waiting for the police. The woman was in shock)",

There is no guarantee that if you had found him he would have lived. I think you know that, but it is worth saying. This experience didn\u2019t just happen to him, it happened to you too. It is okay to be sad over the death of someone you didn\u2019t know. You are going to have feelings of guilt, second guess your decisions and get angry at your self for not doing more. But, try to be kind to yourself. Given the situation, you did what you could. If you can, seek professional help to guide you through these emotions. \n\n &lt;3 Sending virtual hugs your way!",

I want to believe that.\n\nOne of the things that frequently upsets me is that I'm the mother of two young children. My ex husband (their father) is a first responder. He's told me countless times that if I'm ever alone with the kids and I see something, like a car accident, I need to keep going and just call 911. I can't justify putting my kids in danger by pulling over on the side of a highway to help. \n\nIt's almost like the trolley problem. Knowing I'm a mom and I have to prioritize my and my children's safety over all else makes me terrified that I'd be left haunted with \"doing nothing\". Right now my kids are asleep and I'm the only adult in the house. If I heard a neighbor screaming all I could do is call 911, I can't risk getting involved in something dangerous or leaving my preschool age children sleeping alone. \n\nWhen I was a kid I used to lie in bed awake at night, contemplating the fact that somewhere in the world at any given moment there's probably someone dying alone. I'm an atheist now, but as a 10 year old I'd lie there and pray and cry and hope that those people knew someone out there was thinking of them, and that they weren't alone. \n\nOP did an amazing job trying to find a way to help, and they should be proud of that instinct.",

Even if you did find the person, are you capable of being a first responder and aid in stopping bleeding from multiple areas? Do you know which areas to stop bleeding first? If not, you'd be traumatized more watching a person die because you can't help them. Don't put yourself down. There's nothing you could've done.",

Passing a door in the hallway I suddenly heard a \u201cohh OHHHH\u201d sound of a woman. I stopped and listened and heard nothing else. I knew o should have checked by kept going cuz I was weighted down and arms full. \n\nI had forgotten of her by the time I threw it away and came back. \n\nSometime later I\u2019m walking back down the hallway and there\u2019s paramedics leaving her place with an old lady on a stretcher. \n\nI\u2019m very happy she was able to get help somehow, but I could have gotten her help immediately and felt terrible. \n\nBut sorry OP. There\u2019s some other comments like the crowd effect. When and doubt, help when safe to do so or you have the balls to help in danger. But sorry this will probably haunt you for a while!",

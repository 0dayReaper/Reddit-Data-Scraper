    "postText": "I relapsed tonight (sh) and the last time I did so (if I recall correctly) was somewhere in October or November.\n\nI feel awful because my medium distance partner told me to call him and talk to him if I needed anything. He doesn\u2019t know I relapsed, just that I haven\u2019t been grounded today. \n\nWhen I get really stressed out or when my depression worsens I on and off feel really out of body. I constantly forget where I am. My surroundings don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re real to me. Eye contact makes me feel like I\u2019m phasing out of my own mind and body. It makes me feel like I\u2019m experiencing the visual version of what it\u2019s like to hear a ringing in your ear after shock. I went to lunch with a friend today and while it was really good to see him, I just couldn\u2019t look at him for long periods of time or I felt like I was about to vomit.\n\nThis past year has been really stressful. I\u2019ve experienced a lot of change, both good and bad. Recently it\u2019s been a lot more bad. I feel so weak because I haven\u2019t given into sh since last year. \n\nI started journaling to try to ease whatever turmoil I have going on but it didn\u2019t really help. I want to try to keep a consistent journal to try to get better but it kind of made me feel worse after the fact because I read everything I wrote out and it made me feel pathetic and disgusting.\n\nI was supposed to drive out to my partner\u2019s tonight (which is an hour and a half drive) but I decided not to because I was afraid since I kind of keep \u201cfazing in and out\u201d I would crash or something. He offered to come pick me up but they have to wake up early for therapy and I didn\u2019t want to add any more onto his load, especially when it will be something I\u2019ll (hopefully) be capable of in the morning.\n\nI\u2019m afraid to have sex with them because I don\u2019t want them to see what I\u2019ve done and also that would mean they would have to see me naked. Right now I couldn\u2019t stand that either.\n\nI\u2019m hoping when I wake up when never that may be that these feelings go away. At the same time though, I just hope that I don\u2019t wake up. Overall, I just don\u2019t know what to do with myself.\n\nSorry this is long and rambly. I don\u2019t have anyone I can talk to about this without shame and I don\u2019t know how to talk to my partner about this without him being immediately hands on. Besides, I don\u2019t want to add onto my partner\u2019s stress. They\u2019ve already got a million things on his plate and I don\u2019t want to add on, especially because this is something I need to solve on my own.",

I know it\u2019s hard when you don\u2019t want to disappoint them, so it could be better to go to a support group and therapy first. But also your partner &amp; family and friends are there to help you too. I never told anyone directly what I\u2019ve gone through but unknowingly I couldn\u2019t have gotten through it without their support. \n\nEven if it\u2019s just to see them and you don\u2019t tell them why, seeing them and knowing they are there for you could help you remember what matters in life.",

Now, if you know what triggered you, maybe you can avoid it or talk through it with someone. \n\nAs others have said, this is not something you can solve on your own. You need support. You need you cheerleader that says, hey, you made it this long without relapsing. And now, they can celebrate each day going forward. A lot of this is one day at a time. I know it is hard to do that, trust me, I know (Little control freak right here!! Lol) but all of those small victories add up. And that same cheerleader can stand beside you now, and help you get back on track. \n\nAs for the journaling, please don\u2019t feel pathetic and disgusting, you are neither of those! Period! You are strong and courageous for putting your thoughts to paper. You are strong for taking steps to help yourself have a better life. Everyone fails, but it is what we do after that counts. You have shown yourself that you can do this, maybe this time, let your partner help. \n\nAnd for the other feelings, like the disconnected feeling and the nausea, do you have a doctor or anyone who you can talk to? If so, please do. And if not, please ask for help finding someone in your area. \n\nYou are strong, beautiful, courageous and I could keep going! One day bad period does not take away from that nor does it define you",

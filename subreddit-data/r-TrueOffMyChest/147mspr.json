    "postText": "So, my parents F48 and M49 have been married longer than I\u2019ve been alive. After my sister was born my mother was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. If you don\u2019t know Fibro is chronic, widespread pain throughout the body. This left her unable to work. And over time she has increasingly become less and less involved with life. Including married life with my father. Now my father is a good man. By no means am I saying he\u2019s perfect. But my Mother\u2019s disability seemed to leave him as a \u201csingle dad\u201d without him actually being single. We\u2019ve now reached the point where my sister and I have moved out. My father feels that it would be best for both of them to split up as they\u2019ve essentially been roommates with 2 kids. Maybe this will push her to become more involved in life? I\u2019m unsure. All I know is this makes me incredibly sad. I truly do not blame my dad or my mom. However, I\u2019m not sure where this leaves her. She doesn\u2019t have any friends to confide in, her parents have both passed, and her siblings aren\u2019t apart of her life. Yes she has my sister and I but I know she won\u2019t talk to us about how she\u2019s feeling. And she says she doesn\u2019t want to be a burden. I\u2019m also not in any financial position to take care of her and neither is my sister. How do I take my feelings out of the equation in this? What can I do to help my mom? What do I do if she won\u2019t let me help her or tell me when she needs it? I know people get divorced all the time but I\u2019ve grown up my whole life using them as an example of what love looks like. This is really hard",

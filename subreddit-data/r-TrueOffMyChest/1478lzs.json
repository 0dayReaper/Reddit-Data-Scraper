    "postText": "I\u2019m 18 and I just found out yesterday I have a lesion on my liver. The doc said to just wait and check in on it again in 3 months. I did the bad thing and ended up going down a google rabbit hole trying to learn more about this. I\u2019m glad to know what is causing me pain but at the same time, I\u2019m scared. My dad and mom know and I\u2019ve talked to my dad briefly about it and haven\u2019t talked to my mom about how I feel. I don\u2019t really know if I can fully confide in them how scared anxious and worried I am about this.",

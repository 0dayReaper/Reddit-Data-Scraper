ONE FUCKING COMMA in 5 or 6 pages of text. And they gave me a freaking 7/8, which brings it down to like 87%?! Do these people even care how much of an impact it takes???? Like wtf I'm busting my ass and THIS is the thing you decide to \"edit.\" Fuck these people, it's easy to not care when you're online and they can't see the people they're impacting so they don't care.

I hope to go to grad school. But I need letters of recommendation. \n\nHOW THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO GET GOOD LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION WHEN PROFESSORS DOMT EVEN BOTHER SHOWING UP TO THEIR OWN CLASS!?!?!\n\nMy first year was during the pandemic. Then, and ever since, most of my major classes were online. In that time, including the 2 in person classes I was able to take, all but 2 classes were taught by professors. The rest were notes the professor posted at the beginning of the pandemic and recycle every year. The TAs run these classes. They run office hours. They respond to all the emails. They do everything. \n\nI need to get in good with the professors, but it\u2019s impossible when they don\u2019t give a shit enough about their students to update their lectures, much less show up. \n\nAnd you might say, oh well how about just work with them on their research. ID FUCKING LOVE TO IF THEY\u2019D UPDATE THEIR GOD DAMN LABS! OR, and I\u2019m noticing a pattern here, RUN THEIR OWN LABS INSTEAD OF SOMEBODY ELSE! I swear to god, professors have done fuck all since the pandemic at least. \n\nEnd of rant, sorry for taking over your thread OP.",

I would also say ask your TA if they know of any research opportunities, it may be easier ro ask someone already in with teachers than have to do it yourself. I'm a senior undergrad as well, and it's really stressful to think about an actual big kid job like after college and the least these people could do is thier job.",

I had online classes up until second semester of second year, which were outdated slides, or old pre-recordings! I remember hating one professor's videos because she had housework going on in her house!\n\nHold on though! Despite being in person, all the professors went on strikes! Granted I started to disengage with some shitty uni culture regarding admin and a weird hierarchy in reporting certain issues. I have had such an apathy and after completing 2 out of the 2 of my years I've dropped out!\n\nMy friends graduating right now are unsure of what's happened because once again they're on strike and not marking coursework and other important factors to grades!! \n\nThere needs to be a massive shift in how the chain of these universities are affecting us! I'm gutted I spent money on an experience that was so fragmented and deterring. \n\n[The vulnerability of the traditional school emerges from the fact that the strategy of most schools in the higher ed space is one of imitation, not innovation](https://sajithpai.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-Innovative-University-Summary.pdf)",

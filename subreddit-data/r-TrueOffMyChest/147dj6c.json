    "postText": "My dad is in his mid to late 60\u2019s, and he owns Snapchat. Even though he hides his account from being discovered by contacts. He\u2019s always been very secretive and possessive of his phone like he has to guard it for good reasons. My dad has plenty of female friends, and a Facebook account which he doesn\u2019t follow my mom on. I know that because years ago my mom got mad that a female friend thanked him in person for wishing him a happy birthday via Facebook. My dad can\u2019t seem to get off his phone either, even when he was driving me he\u2019d be sending text messages to someone. Whenever we are on vacation he is also glued to his phone. He can be incredibly short-tempered with my mom too. Lastly, he asked me about what \u2018meh\u2019 means because his young female colleague says that, and he didn\u2019t understand. If my dad is cheating, he probably does it because he thinks he is the victim, and wants someone shiny and new to validate his ego. And if I ever confronted him, he will probably start screaming at me telling me I\u2019m always on his fucking back. The worst part is that my mom would forgive him if this is true. I want to confront him so badly, but I know he will lose his goddamn fucking mind",

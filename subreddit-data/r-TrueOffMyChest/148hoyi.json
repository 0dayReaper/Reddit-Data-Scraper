    "postText": "Hi so I know the term gaslighting shouldn't be thrown around lightly but I seriously think they are, for context before I continue theres 4 of us in our group me, L, J and K and we're all female and in High School.\n\nSo I was feeling sick yesterday and said I probably wouldn't be coming in. But I decided to stick it out since I was feeling better in the morning. My friends sit right at the door in our first class and I was running late but when I was walking down the hall to get to class I heard them talking about me nothing bad they were just wondering if I was coming in. So I went in said Hi and they were surprised to see me. So I sat down and we talked during class and I brought up a story which felt fitting at the time and they started like getting defensive and saying it wasn't true, it wasn't even about them. The story was about the time I witnessed a teacher hit someone with their car. They continued to call me a liar and said it didn't happen and I was crazy and I shouldn't make stuff up until the guy behind said it did happen and took my side, I know the story was true as I witnessed it. I'm glad he was able to offer me some validation but them calling me a liar and stuff makes me feel really bad about myself because I know I'm not but when they keep saying it sometimes I genuinely believe I'm just making stuff up when I'm not. Yes I said \"sometimes\" because this isn't the first time, I shared a very personal story which happened to me and was traumatic and they all continued to say it wasn't true. I think I should be more specific but the only people doing the gaslighting are L and J mostly J. K just sits and watches tho. Idk what to do about this they're the only friends I have and I have really bad social anxiety and I wont be able to make new ones. They're genuinely good people apart from this. It's so sad to me to see this but today was my last straw and I needed to tell someone.",

            "comment": "Sounds like gaslighting to me. Have you brought up how you feel when they talk to you like this? If you have and they STILL act this way it might be time to distance yourself. \n\nI know high school is hard fit in and find new friends, but you have to look out for you and your mental health in the end. I don\u2019t know if you have clubs at your school, but if you do maybe try to join one and meet people that way. Once you find common interests with your peers it\u2019s a lot easier to communicate and build friendships that way. \nGood luck!",

Might be time to give them an ultimatum. Change the attitude towards me or I\u2019m distancing myself. I know how hard it is to cut ties with people you care for, but I hope you know you matter and people out there will want to be friend with you and not make you feel like your going crazy when you tell them about experiences you have. I believe in you!",

Join a support group, go to a D&amp;D night at the local game store, do ANYTHING you can to meet people, but don\u2019t keep these people in your life.  They are ACTIVELY harming your mental health by making you question your own sanity.\n\nThere is no way they\u2019re decent people if that\u2019s what they do.",

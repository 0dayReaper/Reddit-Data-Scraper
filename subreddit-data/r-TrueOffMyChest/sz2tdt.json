I was completely caught off guard, I did not agree to this weird experience and I definately didn't enjoy it. We had an argument and he said I killed the fun with my reaction but he already knew how I felt about it.\n\nHe's still hung up on the fight saying I overreacted for no.good reason at all but I don't know. I found it really unpleasent and just weird.",

She killed the mood, because her husband can't come to terms with the fact that what he did was essentially rape---he asked prior for her consent to perform this act, she said no, ***so he did it anyways despite knowing what NO means.*** (For the record, OP, I am being a little sarcastic in the sense that *you did not ruin* **anything,** ***what your husband did was wrong.*** )\n\nI get kinks are varied, and kink shaming sucks sure, ***but forcing your kink on an UNWILLING PARTNER, MARRIED OR NOT, IS STILL RAPE.***\n\n\nFuck dude.

I would never in my right mind do something that could damage my partners trust in me especially with something so intimate such as sex. Its not a general consensus amongst men, its just theres too many prominent pieces of shit like OPs husband. Sorry OP but this isnt the type of thing to take lightly, i would seriously consider a session of therapy because there is no way a sane human would sexually go against your will and then pretend it was your fault. Theres more at play with that psychology than just that action, and its pretty dangerous to let that kind of behavior ho unchecked.",

I'd say the same thing regardless of genders, but this particular act puts her at risk of infection, medical and prescription costs, discomfort, and misery. Urine is very acidic and the vagina is a delicately balanced environment. If you fuck up the ph, it can really cause misery--yeast infections and bacterial vaginosis, for example. Does he care? Nope. His indifference to her wishes, her body, and the potential consequences, is even more disgusting than the act itself. \n\nThe petty in me says she should piss on him somewhere unpleasant for him, but that's terrible advice. (Don't do this, OP) Besides, he might enjoy it, and that's the last thing he deserves.   \n\nI don't even know if it's worth her energy to fight this battle. How do you even begin to try and talk to someone who doesn't understand consent and bodily autonomy? For me, this would probably be a deal breaker.",

People getting hung up on this need to argue with each other, because frankly I think that's a wasted exercise and I don't care what you call it anymore.

Purposely urinating inside your wife without her consent 100% falls into this category. This kind of behavior from spouses,thinking they can do whatever they want to their partner without consent, is WAY more prevalent than people think. It\u2019s abusive and has obviously caused you distress. You\u2019ve unfortunately become a victim of sexual assault &amp; it\u2019s no laughing matter like some people are making it (I\u2019m sure they just don\u2019t know).

At first things are fine and happy but it always ends with her betraying me somehow\n\nEvery morning the pain starts strong and pretty much ruins my mood for the rest of the day. \n\nProblem is how she betrayed me will ruin my life, she has accused me of a 3rd degree felony because of her own poor actions and decisions. \n\nI'm most likely going to prison and soon. I've honestly beentryingg for flings to help get my mind off her and to have fun before I  cant\n\nPlenty of girls are interested but I feel unable to move it further due to everything going on.",

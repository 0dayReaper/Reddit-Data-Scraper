    "postText": "I started to date my bf in February and we became official around Easter. \n\nHis dad used to knock on his bedroom door when I was there but recently since me and my bf got back to his place after been out swimming (we walked in with our swimsuits) his dad has knocked even more frequently and even barged inside the room for no reason. \n\nHis dad once barged in when I laid in my bfs bed in only my underwear, and then the day we got back in swimsuits only, he even as soon as I walked down like almost barged down  as if he hoped to see me change?\n\nI walked up  and when I got back down I found my underwear on the floor when I neatly had put them on the chair hidden due (I was on my period). \nApparently his dad had gone into my bfs room to put my bfs clothes in his drawer? \n\nIdk but his dad keeps coming in at wrong timings and just keeps going down at a weird time during the day when someone most likely is preparing to sleep or change. Today my bf scoldes him for just barging in, and I told that it felt weird. \n\nRecently I even had a nightmare about his dad starring at me while changing were I also screamed help for my bf. Idk I keep getting this feeling as if his dad has some weird intentions of his actions. \n\nI wanted to just talk about it due it was yesterday I had the nightmare and today he just walked in like my nightmare. My bf dunno about my nightmare, I don't plan on telling him. But he know I'm bothered by his dad, I've also said we're adults and not children nor teenagers. \n\nI'm used to once owned my own place  as I'm closer to 30 than 20 while my bf is 4 years younger. So it's not as if we're in a \"typical teenage relationship\"",

    "postText": "I(20M) have been with my girlfriend(20) for almost 5 years now. I love this girl more than words can even describe, and yes at some point things did get hard and we\u2019ve both made some mistakes along the way, but nonetheless our love for each other has never been up for discussion. \n\nExcept for when it comes to my family. Although my family says they love my gf and that she makes me a better me, they turn around and say that I\u2019m too young to be in a serious relationship that I need to grow and learn on my own. To me this doesn\u2019t make any sense, I know every person needs room to venture out on their own and have experiences on their own and for the most part we\u2019ve allowed enough space in our relationship for those things. But I\u2019m also growing along side her and I\u2019m so grateful for that. We graduate college in two years and I truly can\u2019t wait to see what the world has in store for us as an individual and as a couple. \n\nThe thing is there hasn\u2019t been any threats(cheating, major lying, betrayal, etc) in our relationship to make my family feel as if I shouldn\u2019t be in this relationship so i don\u2019t know why my parents are telling me that I\u2019m \u201cwasting my youth on just one girl.\u201d This one girl has helped shaped me into the person I am today, continues to encourage me to become better, and loves me like I\u2019ve never been loved before. So why wouldn\u2019t my family especially my parents want something like this for their child? Whatever their reasoning is, I\u2019m just sick of it and I just want them to understand that I love my girlfriend so much, and I don\u2019t care if at the end of the day I  would\u2019ve \u201cwasted my youth\u201d these years are and will forever be so important to me.",

It\u2019s your relationship! I\u2019m happy you found the one for you, just know that it\u2019s rare and a beautiful thing that you\u2019ve got. Don\u2019t let other peoples jaded views effect your happiness. Sending you all the positive energy!!!",

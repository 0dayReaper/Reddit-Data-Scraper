    "postText": "So just as the title states, I ran away from my family. I (17f) lived in a very toxic household which I had recently tried to get away from. When they got me back they said that it was best for me to go somewhere that I couldn't escape from. They said that their best option was to send me to a mental hospital far away from everyone that I could've been able to talk to. While we were on the way to the hospital, my parents were going on about how they could have me arrested for things I never did, saying that if they really wanted to they would call the cops and tell them to lock me up and throw away the key (which they wouldn't be able to do without a trial for one). When we got there, all the staff members were trying to get both sides of the story, which to backtrack some, my parents gave me a story to stick to (I had to keep to it if I wanted to get out faster). So go over the time that I'm there, it wasn't bad. It was a second home that you wanted to both stay and leave. They amount of people that I saw that were like me and shared the same stories as me. But by the time I had to go, my parents decided to either stick me in a residential hospital or somewhere far away from everything I ever knew and loved. It's been around three to four weeks here, and I'm starting to wish I was back home. However after this, they want me to go to another place. I'm just getting sick and tired of \"we just want what WE think is best for you\" versus what is actually better for me.",

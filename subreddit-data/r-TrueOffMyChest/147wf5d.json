The two oldest have never even mentioned having a friend since primary school, when I try to have a conversation with them all I get back is \u201cyeah\u201d and \u201coh\u201d \n\nMy son was assessed for autism a couple years ago, as suggested by a teacher, but they said he didn\u2019t tick enough boxes for them to diagnose. \n\nI feel so genuinely sorry for them, I feel as though they have wasted their teen years experiencing absolutely nothing. It sounds awful but I worry how they will ever cope with the real world, I don\u2019t see how, with how they are at the moment, they will ever get a job of any sorts or even just be well rounded adults. \n\nThey won\u2019t even make an effort which is really worrying me, I try to talk to them but get absolutely nothing back.",

Not with us, but anyone outside this household, dead silent. My hub said he was the same way. So we guided him to move out and work at a resort. He's really learning. Baby steps. I do blame myself though. I never really pushed him to go out and socialize. We were happy living rural, always doing something in the backyard, reading/writing (my teen has an awesome imagination, I love it!)... So I feel extremely guilty about it. I understand where this parent is coming from. However! My latina mom side would also kick in if he said, \"oh\" or \"yeah\" - No, Mijo. We talk in this family. Hope OP'S kids find their voice.",

I\u2019d highly recommend you let your sons (and eventually your daughter too, when she\u2019s old enough) get part-time jobs.

It put me in a noncompetitive and sociable environment where I was constantly talking to someone I didn\u2019t know, and it developed my social skills fast. Honestly I wish I\u2019d started working sooner.  I promise, your kids are not broken \u2014 they\u2019re just a little shy!",

I\u2019m saying that *at best* we don\u2019t know whether she is or isn\u2019t, and that from my experience, I could easily see my own shitty mom writing OP\u2019s post. It just\u2026doesn\u2019t *come off* sincere enough, for the topic at hand. There\u2019s a hint of obliviousness and ineptitude to OP\u2019s post.\n\nHalf of OP\u2019s frustrations are towards what *she wants* out of her kids, like them getting a job. Note the wording at the end, \u201cthey won\u2019t even try to make an effort\u201d, putting the blame on her kids for not trying. \u201cI get absolutely nothing back\u201d, expecting to receive something from her troubled kids she apparently cares about. Her frustration is not fully directed towards the concern that her kids won\u2019t talk; it is instead split, with part of it directed towards the fact that she *isn\u2019t getting what she wants.* She *expects to receive something* from them. This careful, particular, meticulous phrasing is what is tipping people off, and it *never* comes from a place of wanting to help somebody.\n\nAlso, yes, parents *can* act two faced around strangers so that they look better than they really are in private. Who knew even adults with kids are susceptible to having an ego. Crazy stuff. Totally unhinged to say that.\n\nWhat I said was \u201cyou\u2019re assuming she\u2019s sweet and caring based off this one little post made on the internet\u201d. All you\u2019re doing is proving my point, doing exactly what you\u2019re accusing me of doing, just from the opposite end of the spectrum.",

Luckily by then my only friend (a dog) was threatened by dad and i decided i was going to run away. \n\nTold police if they took me back there i was killing myself as soon as i got the chance. They let my mom come pick me up. Father decided not to fight the custody cause he didnt want to lose his govt position ( there was a lot of evidence against him). \n\nNow at 25 years old i have difficulty talking to people cant really make eye contact unless i force myself i also work in one of the least social jobs there is. And when i do talk to people i dont know what im going to talk about or say at all. Usually i have to think of what i want to talk about before hand. \n\nWhats even funnier with my father is he thinks that out of all the relationships he has me and him have the best one. His second son hates him and has made a \u201cjoke\u201d about bringing his gun to school. Luckily police took it very seriously. And his third son is suicidal and talks even less than i do. \n\nAnyway sorry if i rambled a bit.",

I wouldn\u2019t say I was super shy as a kid, but I\u2019ve always been kind of a homebody, more introverted, and I\u2019ve suffered from anxiety all my life. Even though I was raise by a single mom and we struggled financially, my mom always made sure to expose me to as many extracurricular activities and summer camps as she could when I was little, I tried a bunch of sports, theater, art, music, and dance classes until I found a passion in dance and stuck to that. I appreciate that she did this because it exposed me to different social settings and set me up with a group of friends outside of school that I could relate to with similar interests. \n\nApart from helping me find something I was passionate about, she also encourage me to help out the community by having us volunteer to serve food to the homeless and helping out at toy drives. During my \u201ctween\u201d years I volunteered with a local recreational camp for kids with special needs and it really helped me grow as a person to become more outgoing and conscientious. \nOnce I was in high school, due to how I was raised it made easier for me to be involved in our volunteer club and other leadership clubs like link crew and ASB. While I never had the charisma or confidence to campaign for any executive roles in student government, I was the vice president of our volunteer club. I also worked throughout high school teaching dance, working at the YMCA during the summers, and tutoring at underprivileged elementary schools. \n\nI definitely wouldn\u2019t have been as involved or socially adept if my mom didn\u2019t put in the groundwork when I was younger. When I got to college I was shocked to see how a lot of my friends had such little contact with their parents and when visiting them they just stayed in their rooms the whole time instead of participating in conversations or hanging out with their parents or family friends. I almost felt awkward for them, it was like they didn\u2019t know how to interact with adults and at that point we were young adults so I did encourage a lot of my friends to actually hang out and get to know their parents better lol. \n\nAs an adult in my mid 20\u2019s now I try to treat my anxiety the best I can with meditation, therapy and yoga. I also have a couple of close friends, and I feel comfortable enough to establish a good rapport with coworkers and clients. \n\nFor your children I would recommend more communication within the household, as a start maybe try to have family dinners every night without phones and try to take an interest in their passions and hobbies if they have them. If they don\u2019t, require them to participate in at least one school club or extracurricular activity during the school year and to get jobs during the summer, I was never able to just sit my ass at home during the summer and nows the perfect time for them to start working since most schools just ended. During the summer honestly just take away their screens, until they get a job, they don\u2019t need them for school or anything so it\u2019ll actually have them make an effort to put themselves out in the real world. Try not to put them down and make them feel like they\u2019re not good enough or that there\u2019s something wrong with them. It might be a challenging transition for them, so try to be active in their job search when they start so that they\u2019re not just floundering like fish out of water, find good places for teens to work, and offer help with their applications if they need it. Good incentives during the school year might be an allowance or an item they might want, for getting them to participate extracurricular activities. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re religious or not but if you are maybe have them participate in whatever youth group your church holds, or if your family is from a certain culture try to find ways to connect them to that community whether through art, cooking, dance etc. For your teens especially your daughter since it seems like she might be graduating soon, teach them how to cook and basic household chores so that they can be fully functioning adults when they eventually leave the nest. I personally loved learning how to cook from my mom and it brought us closer. There are so many kids in college that don\u2019t even know how to do laundry, so by teaching these things early you\u2019ll be raising self sufficient young adults:) And for your 9yo put her in summer camps so she can start socializing with peers her own age or at most local recreational centers or YMCA\u2019s they have a number of classes and sports that kids can participate in, you can ask her which ones might interest her and have her try them out. It\u2019s just a start but you gotta put you foot down sometimes, I hope this helps\ud83d\ude4f",

She had the opposite reaction your kids had, she became extremely social and tried to in any way possible get friends. \n\nBut she didn\u2019t know the basic social rules, she would lie a lot and be quite uncomfortable. Once puberty came and she became sexually aware, she dated a guy she met on a ice cream shop and lost her virginity to that guy that very day. When he dumped her, she started dating his cousin and she tried to get pregnant by him at 16. When he dumped her then she slept with her aunts husband and made us promise not to call the cops because it was \u201cconsensual\u201d. \n\nShe would make sexual sounds in the classroom and spread her legs \u201cjokingly\u201d while sitting on a table and she would show us animal porn, to get a reaction from us. \n\n\nClearly this girl wasn\u2019t okay, but while growing up her parents never took her to the park or made her interact with other kids. She had no idea how to talk to people or how to behave. If you don\u2019t take your kids out, let them socialize, watch their behaviors and correct them when they are doing something inappropriate then you aren\u2019t doing your job right as a parent. \n\nI am not saying that this is what is what happened with your kids.

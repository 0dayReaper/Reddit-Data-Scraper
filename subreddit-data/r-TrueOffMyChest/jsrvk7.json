I only really told my close friends about it because I didn't want anybody spouting their nonsense. Though my mom works at an assisted living facility for the elderly and there was one woman who that day refused to put on her mask and my mom was trying to get her to get it on. There had already been cases of covid in the building and it was decently high risk cuz they're all old as shit but she kept ranting about how it wasn't that serious and \"nobody's dying\". My mom lost it. And honestly I don't blame her. She just lost her father 2 days ago to a virus that people don't take seriously. And it's probably due to that lackadaisical attitude that he was infected in the first place. It's just despicable.",

We haven\u2019t had an outbreak, per se, but I know DOZENS of people who have gotten COVID. Luckily they\u2019re all young and have been able to bounce back pretty quickly, but having to place them in a cold, empty dorm and tell them they can\u2019t leave their 10\u2019x10\u2019 room with cinderblock walls for 14 days is heartbreaking. If everyone just wore their damn masks and socially distanced, I wouldn\u2019t have 84 students currently in \u201cquarantine jail\u201d begging me to be able to just go on a walk to preserve their mental health. \n\n(The 84 are not all positive cases. Most are close contacts of positive cases.)",

They returned home, visited their elderly parents (my husband's aunt and uncle), one of whom is diabetic and overweight, and within 2 days almost everyone had symptoms of Covid. I've known coworkers and friends of friends with it, but this is my first family member who's been diagnosed. \n\nThe kids recovered well. The adults are recovering, although it kicked their asses and they couldn't sit up for a few days. Unfortunately, his uncle was hospitalized yesterday because he couldn't catch his breath. The whole time he said he was beating it, but it progressed, and by the 10th day his wife called paramedics. He's responding well to oxygen, but who knows. He's the diabetic in his early 70s.\n\nWe're all just relieved that they didn't visit my husband's 93-year-old grandmother before they showed symptoms. (Jfc.)\n\nIn another story, my husband heard that a coworker in another state knew she was exposed to Covid, got tested, was awaiting her test results, and went into work anyway despite having a runny nose. She took the online survey required by the company and it said she shouldn't go in, but she ignored it. Now her coworkers have to get tested. She doesn't see what she did wrong and thought the runny nose was no big deal. FWIW, the company lets everyone WFH. She didn't need to go in at all. Covid Mary prefers it. This has really undermined my faith that information treatment is all that effective at influencing behavior.",

He was a cop (I know in this age many shun the police) but he was a great man. He responded to a home that had a call for a sexual assault situation. One cop had already been shot. He tried to circle around the back of the home and was shot twice from a second story window and killed instantly. \n\nMy first thoughts hearing this was anger at the person that did the shooting and what I\u2019d like to do to that person. Then he ended up killing himself in the standoff. My emotions turned to complete sadness. Then I discovered he was a fellow veteran (as my friend was) and suffered from PTSD. My emotions changed yet again from a sadness to an anger about our system. I\u2019ll never forgive the troubled shooter but as I\u2019ve grown I have learned that the mentally unstable are not getting the care that they need/deserve. There\u2019s a lot of things wrong in the US that led to that path and I do still hold a level of frustration and sadness when it comes to those issues. \n\nIn the end for me my only choice is to elect the leaders that I think will influence change in a positive way. But at the same time I realize 90% of politicians are all corrupt. Which as I\u2019m typing... makes me sad again.",

I'm sorry that you'll continue to see that her loss, your suffering is not enough to convince certain huge segments of people to care enough about the lives and suffering of other people to follow basic safety precautions. It's unfair, it's unnecessary, and it's plain fucking shitty. Anger is so appropriate here, and I'm angry with you. I'm fucking angry that to a lot of people, your grandma was just old, so who cares? I'm angry that people just won't stop flouting the science and follow the guidelines because of their selfishness.  I'm angry as fuck that they could have just done this completely months ago and been back to a more normal life by now. Your grandma should still be here.  At the very least, you should have been able to say goodbye. I'm so sorry for all of it, and I hope that when the sadness comes it doesn't bury you, and that very soon after that you can think of all your wonderful memories of her with peace and joy.",

I'm so sorry for your family and your grandmother. We will continue to do our part and hope for the best I guess. I'm angry at these people who refuse to do simple things that can save others. We have to all do this together for it to work. But our World is so selfish and the majority of people just don't care unless it directly effects them. I'm sorry again! My family and I will do our part as we have. So please at least know that. I wish all of you safety and health! Peace \ud83d\ude14",

He took a tumble on some stairs as he was dying of poisonous blood- the same disease Adam Sandler suffered from in the movie \"Funny People\"- AML- Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, a movie that was released while my dad was dying so it was super weird.\n\nAnyway, After my dad took that fall I got a call from my family that Friday at about 4pm that this was it and dad was gonna die and I needed to leave work with no car and travel 25 miles and see him because this was it- anyway I made it and got to hang out with my dad that night- he had this weird level of fucking clarity. He was always the smartest man I know. Everyone says that about their dad and I genuinely don't disbelieve them. But my dad was really knowledgeable and instilled that in me.\n\nI had the best night with him when the family returned from the hospital and my dad took on this insane crystal clarity that night. I got this call that it was all over and for a month beforehand I was wiping his ass because his poisoned blood had overloaded his system so harshly- but that night he was just so crystal clear.\n\nI remember being so impressed that I challenged him to name all the countries in Africa and the motherfucker did it.\n\nAnyway, two days later and he's fucking bad again- his lungs are so filled with fluid he can hardly breathe- each breath a rattling mess...\n\nThe hospice nurse comes by for her scheduled visit and my dad was sooo bad. I asked her how long she thought he had left.\n\nThis is a blue haired Betty who's done nothing but Hospice care her entire life- she told me he had at least 2-3 weeks left in that state.\n\nHe died in my arms 13 minutes later. The fluid in his lungs that he was fighting overcame him and he took his last breath as I frantically tried to adjust him to clear his airway.\n\nI'll never forget that look he gave me about 3 seconds before he closed his eyes for good.\n\nIt was this look of tired, sore satisfaction. He was telling me it was over and he was happy with his life and with me.\n\nI can't describe it- I didn't know he was about to die- I picked him up and moved him from one chair to another to open up his airway and he just died staring at me. I was 25. I'm 37 now and it is a very hard moment to live down.\n\nI am very sorry for the rant. He died on 11/02/2009 and I've been struggling lately and this caught me off guard today and I had to share it.\n\nAnyway, I felt so much anger at that bitch for breaking my fucking heart twifet. I genuinely hated her for about a year.\n\nShe told me my dad was gonna live on death's door for 2 or 3 weeks which fucking crushed me. He died looking me directly in the eyes alone in a room 15 minutes later at 4:37PM and I felt like she sold me a timeshare and robbed me of that.\n\n\nIt was just me projecting, though. This woman did nothing wrong but everything that happened- all those life altering moments in that 15 minute span for placed firmly upon the mantle of her incorrectitude, as if she was dictating the pulse of the world as she spoke.",

She\u2019s lived 15 minutes away my entire life, raised me when my parents worked nights, baked cookies with me for every holiday and every Sunday we eat dinner at her house. She\u2019s in her 80s but relatively healthy and I\u2019m terrified to lose her. She\u2019s mostly independent and doesn\u2019t go out much at all. \n\nIf it helps why don\u2019t you tell us about your Grandma. What was she like? If you\u2019re not there yet that\u2019s ok. \n\nPoint is people need to man the hell up and wear the stupid mask and practice social distancing. But because wearing the mask is only helping the people around you, some morons just think it\u2019s infringement on their rights. You know what else is a right? To live and be healthy. I also get angry at people who blatantly ignore the dangers because it\u2019s not their problem (yet). Trump miraculously getting covid and recovering doesn\u2019t help the doubters. It feeds their delusion that this virus isn\u2019t real or it\u2019s little more than a cold. I think,\nHow can you  say you love your elderly loved ones, friends, parents, neighbors, if you won\u2019t protect them? It\u2019s disgusting absolutely disgusting.",

We are all living with a much larger specter of illness and death than we generally do in today\u2019s already dangerous world, and anti-maskers and Covid-19 deniers make it worse for us every day. The precautions are so simple to follow, and hardly life altering; their refusal to play safe is a callous slap in our faces, and is bringing increase risk of sickness and death to so many. I am very sorry for your loss, but stay angry. Preach your anger to people who support you, and especially to the people who will carry responsibility for more losses like yours.",

I am so angry, if people could simply respect others, be disciplined than perhaps we would have a chance. Asian countries have been dealing with the pandemic thanks to citizens following the rules. Its not difficult to keep 2m apart, wash your hands and wear a mask. If people stopped being selfish and did what they are told businesses would have a chance and so would the most vulnerable. In the end its all about everyone working together. I feel so sad for families who have lost loved ones. It is truly tragic especially knowing that it all goes down to people respecting simple rules. You clearly have lived a privileged life and have no idea what it means to live in suffering.",

He was hulucinating from the prescription he was on and just getting to that old age where everyone knew it was his time. He didn't test positive for Covid but the thing that I hated about the virus was the rule that followed it. He was only permitted one designated relative to visit. So his family who hasn't seen him since the start of quarantine also won't get to see him before he passed away. All this and yet my family is still insistent that the virus isn't a big deal. Like wtf I just wanted to see him before he passed but because people didn't take it seriously at the time I didn't get to see him.",

Covid is extremely deadly towards 70 plus crowd especially if they have multiple conditions. Younger people risk of death from covid is similar to the flu, so people are done with these insane lockdowns. At the same time though everyone regardless of covid should be practicing good health hygiene(washing hands, covering mouth when coughing, staying home when sick etc..)",

Her family was Jehovah's Witness, she was a very robust lady, she had a fall and broke her hip, they did surgery and she recovered very well, still very coherent and everything. She ended up falling again, we had come to find out later on that she had a UTI and was getting dizzy and falling, well this second surgery she had was the result of falling and breaking her other hip. At this point she lost a lot of blood between the two surgeries. She was declining and in need of a blood transfusion, her son who had only recently converted to JW was her medical POA and he chose to not get her the transfusion as it's against their belief and she ended up passing away, had she gotten that transfusion she would have healed up perfectly fine and probably lived another decade or more.\n\nWhat makes me so irrationally angry is that while I understand it's their belief, no one went to her and explained the situation, let her decide in her final moments if this is how she wants to go. The son wasn't even in the state, he was out of state but had the capability to travel. It seems like such a god damn waste especially since she was fine and enjoying life just prior. So while it's not a covid incident, I totally understand the anger you feel towards the stupidity of people. It's just not right.",

I have a Master\u2019s Degree in Biological Science, so I\u2019ve been telling my family for the entire year, \u201cDo not put yourself in a high-risk situation unnecessarily, and you need to quarantine or we WILL get Covid,\u201d telling them to avoid going to church every Sunday (I\u2019m from the American south, so you can imagine how they weren\u2019t fans of that suggestion). They didn\u2019t listen, and they brought it home from church. I got sick, and so did my brother, parents, both grandparents, and some extended family. Everyone recovered except for Pa. He was in the hospital for two weeks, and complications were too much for him to pull through. \n\nMy grandparents quarantined very well, and hadn\u2019t left their farm in months. When I got the news, my blood ran cold. Seeing these idiots out here blatantly denying the reality of this virus is mind-numbing and infuriating. I miss my Pa. I\u2019ll miss that man every goddamn day for the rest of my life. He was a strong, kind, thoughtful man, and I hope to be half as good as he was during my time. \n\nAll this to say: it\u2019s hard. I don\u2019t think this pain or frustration will go away. It gets easier, though. The first few days I cried and cried and cried. Ugly crying. I was a wreck, understandably. It\u2019s okay to let yourself fall apart and mourn. Let that shit out; trust me, it helps when little else can. Day by day, it\u2019ll get a little easier to keep everything together. Until then, remember to stay hydrated, eat to keep up your strength, and reach out to friends and family for support if you can. I\u2019m sending you love, and I hope that you can find some peace.",

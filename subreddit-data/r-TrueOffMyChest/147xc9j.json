    "postText": "I hung out with some guy last night (36M) and I had no interest in fucking him. He didn\u2019t get that for some reason and got so pushy. \n\nDespite me saying \u201cno\u201d or some other variation of it, it seemed like every few minutes he\u2019d plead with me or push me to try and let him fuck me or \u201cyanky\u201d his \u201cwanky\u201d.\nHe tried pulling my underwear down last night but I stopped him because I didn\u2019t want to lead him on. I told him that and he got bitter. \n\nThis morning I still had no interest in fucking him and he was still pleading with me to touch his dick in some way, this included him pulling down my underwear while I was half awake, putting the blanket over the both of us with the intention of getting me to suck him off etc. He literally put his dick on my lips despite me still being barely awake. \n\nHe was acting like a child and still begging me to \u201cyanky\u201d his \u201cwanky\u201d. I\u2019m shuddering just thinking about it. \n\nI was so fucking tired and almost let him have his way with me, but then I told myself to stand my ground and not tolerate some asshole who doesn\u2019t understand \u201cno\u201d. \n\n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous that I\u2019m coming across men in their 30\u2019s who don\u2019t understand basic fucking boundaries. Like what the actual fuck\u2026.\n\n\nEdit 1: AGAIN. For. The. Last. Time. \n\nI was drunk and not thinking straight. I just wanted somewhere comfortable to sleep. He was being nice earlier that night and I didn\u2019t want to think he was a bad person because I\u2019ve already met too many shitty people. I wanted to give him a chance to redeem himself. I didn\u2019t realize how fucked up this whole thing was until I got home and talked to a friend. It started to sink in more. \n\nBack in 2021 I was sexually assaulted and nearly killed by my ex, so you\u2019d think I\u2019d be more careful\u2026 sadly that\u2019s not been the case. \n\nCould be that I have a subconscious desire for self-sabotage. Who the fuck knows\n\nEdit 2: Probably made things worse for myself with the edit but whatever\n\nEdit 3: Ffs yes I was drunk and stupid. Can y\u2019all PLEASE stop giving me grief for that now?\n\nEdit 4: Thanks to the shithead who sent me the classic passive aggressive RedditCare message. It\u2019s much appreciated\n\nEdit 5: Okay it\u2019s established that I\u2019m a lunatic and a fucking moron. Cool beans.\n\nEdit 6: I was wearing a dress, that\u2019s why it was so easy for him to pull off my underwear.\n\nEdit 7: I should\u2019ve used a throwaway\u2026 didn\u2019t expect this to blow up the way it did. \nYeah I know everyone says that, but I genuinely didn\u2019t think it would get this much attention like Jesus fuck\n\nEdit 8: Believe it or not I like to give guys the benefit of the doubt once in a while. I didn\u2019t want to automatically think he was a bad person for the sake of keeping myself sane. But I realized the whole thing was fucked when I got home",

I also didn't even consider the legal outcome of pushing back against him/biting his dick off, because the first thing that comes to mind when trying to protect yourself against a man trying to sexually assault you is 'is he gonna kill me?'. It doesn't even get to the point of \"hmm he could sue me in a couple days\" when you're focused on \"how am I getting out of this situation alive\".\n\nNot exactly victim blaming, but it wouldn't hurt to be a bit more understanding of how women (and victims of sexual assault in general) react to the threat and aggressive behaviour of men trying to pressure and force us into sex and sexual activities.",

I think he was hoping to use the fact that you were drunk for his own benefit, that makes me even more disgusted by him.\nThere are a lot of entitled people around that thinks that their needs and wants are more important than anyone elses, so, please be careful and take care of yourself! And if you can - talk to someone.",

It's not her fault that he didn't take no, but if he was expecting sex and she wasn't, than why was she still at his house? Did he really want her there if they weren't going to do anything? Honestly it sounds like OP overstayed her welcome, and this guy tacked on more pressure and tried to take advantage of that too.",

I dont even want to attempt to read the comments\n\nThis is awful, but I wanted to let you know trauma reenactment is a very real thing and I've gotten myself into plenty of unsavory situations trying to (subconsciously) rewrite my narrative and have more control over things I didnt have control over. Don't beat yourself up for reckless behavior like this because it has very legitimate reasons and is/has caused you very real pain that you have to find a way to cope with. Not something you've done \"wrong\", it's a way to survive your experience and that is valid in and of itself. I'm just sorry its brought more pain, I have much of that same experience. It just creates space for more trauma to happen and then you just feel responsible because you put yourself there, but dont let yourself be mean to ....yourself. that was an awkward sentence, but its nothing to shame yourself for. I have done 1 thing that I am so ashamed of and humiliated by and I was also drunk out of my mind and blackout when I did it. I had just been assaulted, began a severe shutdown that ended up turning into catatonia and ended up getting ect i was in such a severely depressed state. It was bad. But years later, if given the opportunity to apologize for my inappropriate behavior (or what I'm like 96% sure I did, anyway) I'd explain to the person why the hell i did that. It was completely out of character for me, inappropriate and I am ashamed but I understand the place i was operating from. \n\nBe nice to yourself. No fun living with a bully you can't ever escape from",

We say \"no\" with words, but also with actions. There's no way I would go back to someone's house and sleep in their bed if I wasn't interested in something happening. No way I'd put myself in that situation, because I'm responsible for keeping myself safe. \n\nI'm not excusing what he did. It was coercive and unacceptable, and likely would be considered sexual assault. But also.. you're an adult and you're responsible for your choices. Maybe choose better next time?",

The women being just as judgemental normally have rapist fucks in their family tree and it's easier to victim blame than man blame. Yes they'll tell you not all men, give us a chance and when you do they do this then tell you you should have known better. Men don't take accountability for themselves because nearly every other man alive makes the same excuses. He tried raping you. That's what that was. The fact you were that hammered and still kept going also tells me this isn't his first time being a rapist. It's not your fault. At all. Just as men experience the right to get drunk and and meet people where they want without being raped, we should also have that right. But we won't and never will while men are in charge. Don't feel guilty, feel rage. Because you have done NOTHING wrong. Bad drunken  choices doesn't give any man the right to put his hands on you or pressure you in any way and anyone saying anything else has a lot of skeletons in their closet. I'm quite a bit older than you and I've experienced hell on earth at the hands of men. And every \"good\" man out there has eventually asked me what I done to deserve it. It's hard wired in them to put the responsibility of their actions and behaviour onto us. They can't be responsible for their own behavior because it may male them feel bad, so we cop it instead. You're completely innocent in this. He's a predator and anyone who says otherwise are just like him. Sorry, not sorry.

I mean going to bed with a man you don't plan to have sex with and you stay in the same room at night together I mean that's just really hard to Fathom that. Obviously he thought hey we're sleeping together we're going to have sex. I would have made him sleep somewhere else if you had to sleep in the same room or whatever for whatever reason or I would have gone home alone. Obviously he should have took no for an answer and not kept pestering you trying to coerce you into having sex. I'm glad you didn't give in because that wouldn't have been right for you and it would just reiterate to this jerk that hey all I got to do is nag her to death and they'll open their legs for me.\n\nI have had to deal with guys like that before and it's a huge turnoff.

So low in fact one would need an industrial oil drilling machine to even have a hope of unearthing the thing. But one doesn't have to sink it even lower. Have some basic decency, as an adult if not as a man.\n\nYes, OP should have know better than to go with a strange dude, but why is this the narative? Why is it that she is blamed for getting drunk (with him as witness) and into his apartment, and he is not as the dude who invited her in and the proceeded show no human decency? \n\nJust a thought, but maybe, just maybe, we should stop seeing women as commodities and more as people with agency and a soul.

Today, getting out of the situation by leaving has become a whole political land mine, but everyone advising women to watch their alcohol and take that uber is not a \"misogynist\" or \"incel\" as accused.  A lot of us are older women from an era when guys were just as disrespectful but we didn't trust them NOT to be disrespectful and went on dates forewarned and fore-armed.  It wasn't ALL guys, but \"mashers\" were a known thing, and so were those hatpins.\n\nEdited to add:  https://blurredbylines.com/blog/hatpin-panic-mashers-stabbings-hat-pins/",

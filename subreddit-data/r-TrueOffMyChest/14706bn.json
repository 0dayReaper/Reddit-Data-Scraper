Only thing keeping me here was work and my relationship. Work has gotten so stressful that I\u2019m downing a bottle of pepto at least three days a week and my hair started falling out and thinning again. My relationship is spiraling out and the trust is dwindling. I hate everything and I\u2019m never in a good or positive mood anymore. I\u2019ve lost all will to continue with anything here.",

Over lived on both coasts and 3 Midwest states\u2026.. honestly, the \u201cfly over\u201d states, in my opinion, offer the best life balance especially when you get outside larger cities. Best wishes for your future!",

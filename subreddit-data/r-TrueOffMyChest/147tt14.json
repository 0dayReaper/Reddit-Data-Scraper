    "postText": "So I 24F and 25M have been married together for 3 years and i recently found out from his best friend as me and him (25M) would joke around and stuff when he mentioned that he\u2019s still mad at my husband for not telling him whom he lost his virginity to until 5 years later. Of course I mentioned that he should\u2019ve known that when him and his first girlfriend got together that he would lose his virginity to her, just for his best friend to tell me that it was actually my husband girl best friend that he lost his virginity too. The best friend thought I already knew but apparently my husband decided to lie to me about that and continue to still talk to her to this day. We\u2019re having a baby and I don\u2019t know what to do because if he can lie about something like this what else is he lying about",

Not common, but quite a few people do maintain a friendship if the breakup wasn't a train wreck. If it's also the woman he lost his virginity to, then it was a long time ago. Regardless, if you're not willing to sit him down and talk about it, then nothing will get resolved and you're going to start making up scenarios in your head until you begin to act on them and it drives you two apart.",

She probably would snap , maybe he had this experience before and just didn\u2019t want to talk about it incase that\u2019s how you were too",

Well, it didn't work, we liked each other, but it wasn't romantic love and that can't be forced. After a short time, we broke up and went back to being friends and were for years while both of us had different partners. \n\nNow, our partners knew that she and I had a short relationship, and I don't know why your partner would not disclose that to you, but it's just to say that there isn't necessarily a reason to start believing the worst. Men and women can just be friends, also after having a physical relationship. \n\nFrom your story it doesn't sound like he lied to you though, he just didn't tell you. He might not think it's a big deal or have experience with women going off the rails with jealousy when told, I don't know, but neither do you. Just talk to him about it, no reason to start believing the worst.",

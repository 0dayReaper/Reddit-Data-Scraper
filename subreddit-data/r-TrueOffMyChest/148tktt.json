    "postText": "I (19 F) recently have really been wanting to \u201chook up\u201d with my best friend (18 F). \nI know that I can never do this or ever bring it up but I can\u2019t help but want to. We are so similar. We get along perfectly. We\u2019ve been going to a lot of shows recently and having fun (if you know what I mean). And I have found myself very sexually attracted to her. I don\u2019t have feelings for her or anything. I just find her extremely attractive and I really want to get intimate with her. Only once really. I have past sexual trauma with an old friend and this might have something to do with it I feel like. But I really can\u2019t help but feel like I want to. We both have similar sexual desires too. I truly think she is my twin flame and I can\u2019t screw up our friendship though. I have to just accept that it\u2019s never going to happen. I know she definitely doesn\u2019t feel the same way too. And every so often she\u2019ll talk about sex in joking way. And it i always secretly hope she wants to. And that\u2019s kind of what a lot of our convos revolve around it. I think it\u2019s just because we both are pretty sexual people.  It has also been a while since we both have had sex. \nI don\u2019t really know why I want to so badly but I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. And I keep catching myself thinking about it when I\u2019m with her.",

You\u2019re super curious about having sex with a girl, but are too afraid to actually ask anyone, so you just want to goof around in VR.\n\nThis will tell her that you actually are interested, and that you want to try girls, but also that you want it to be casual and playful. She may respond that it\u2019s a great idea.. and even admit that she doesn\u2019t know how \u201csex\u201d in VR would work, so you should just try experimenting with each other in person.",

Just make it all secretive, and like you are letting her in on a huge part of you. Show her a really hot video, and say that you need to find someone to try that with. Then just shut up and wait for her to either give you tips on finding a partner, or volunteering herself..",

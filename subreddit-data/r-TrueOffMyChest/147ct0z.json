    "postText": "Hi all.\r  \n\r  \nAs I near turning 30 in October, I realize I have regrets that I want to turn into positive achievements. A lot of this have to do with confidence. In short, I lived my life as an introverted people pleaser, never really knowing my true identity, until now. Thus, I have a Hail Mary ahead of me if I want to achieve my goals.\r  \n\r  \nMy main struggles in all of this:\r  \n\r  \nPhysical appearance (face.) I am no Ryan Reynolds, lol, but I still want to be confident in my appearance. Have struggled my entire life with that.\r  \n\r  \nEye contact. SO MANY people have caught me on this. My shyness/lack of good self-esteem and confidence immediately shows a lot because of eye contact struggles. I think this also ties to self-confidence.\r  \n\r  \nCareer. Was recently laid off, am in panic mode. I know what I want to do, but desire start by a certain date.\r  \n\r  \nSelf-esteem/self-confidence. Culmination of all of the above.\r  \n\r  \nHow did you, in your experience, overcome any of the above?",

I would say don't give up, as that is what I have had to tell myself.  \n\nI have been overweight my whole life, but I have started working out for myself and my own health.  \n\nI have spent decades working retail as college was not something I found any joy in, but I have started completing Coursera courses in IT to try and improve my career and financial position.\n\nI am incredibly socially awkward, especially with new people and double especially if I am attracted to them in any way, but I have tried to be more comfortable in my skin and sharing my emotions, otherwise I will always feel isolated and lonely.\n\nI intend to also seek therapy, as I find liking myself very difficult, but that is also a daunting and possibly expensive journey.  Despite that, hopefully it will be worth it in the end I hope.\n\nRemember, as cheesy as it sounds, you need to repeat to yourself that you like yourself, you love yourself, and you are worthy of love and respect.  You got this!",

    "postText": "I've escaped home (27f) due to extreme physical abuse and threats to end my life by my family. I've disappeared from my family's life without a sign or warning. I can't forgive them for leaving me with no choice BUT to do this. I hate that I was pushed to a breaking point, and now it has come to this. I've blocked all my family members and deleted every account I have.\n\nWhat pains me the most is the fact that today's my sister's 18th birthday, and I took that attention away from her because my family is now only focused on trying to find me. She is graduating school soon after and I took that away as well. \n\nI feel so broken. I'm so terribly broken I can't even describe what I feel right now. The moment I think of it I start sobbing. She deserved the best 18th birthday with her family intact, happy, and loving. But now she's alone.\n\nGod I can't stop the tears from coming.\n\nEdit: thank you all so much for these comments, i still feel immense pain but I'm trying to take everything you're saying in and it helps ease up the pain. I can't reply to everyone, but just know that I read everything. Thank you",

The only people to blame are your family, and I feel like any 27 yo should be able to leave home and not be tortured by their own family, which should be the people you could trust the most.",

You both deserve a good birthday every year and it sucks that that\u2019s not apparently what happens. It sucks that you had to leave and this is going to distract from her birthday but I think the tragedy is not the one birthday, but the overall situation in which you and your sister are not able to have a happy birthday every year, or stay safely at home without having to escape like you have just done. Overall, it\u2019s  a reason to grieve hard every once in a while. \n\nYou\u2019re probably very overwhelmed if this is just happening and that can make everything seem 1 million times sadder, harder, well, devestating and so I feel like if you hang on, it\u2019ll ease up a little bit and you can focus on the things that will bring about a positive result whatever those things are. In the meantime you should take the time to grieve and cry and feel awful about the fate that you\u2019re experiencing which is not fair to you or your sister especially when many people seemingly enjoy happiness and safety without effort.  Its a valid reason to feel sad as hell for yourself and your sister. I do hope you find happiness, both of you.  I also hope you can release the sense of guilt for any of this.  Sounds like you are doing the best you can.  \ud83c\udf38",

If you memorized her phone number download an app named TextNow and contact her. It allows you to change numbers as well if they find out ur TextNow number. There\u2019s many ways, but no matter what you do stress to her the importance of not letting your parents know anything. Also if you hang out, do NOT take her to where you live.",

For 10 entire years, I never once spoke to her. Not on Mother\u2019s Day, Christmas, or any holidays. \n\n1. Try to get into some kind of safe, stable home/ living situation asap. Even if you need to live in a tiny box if that\u2019s the only thing that you can afford, or with roommates. \n\n2. Get into therapy! It helped me tremendously!! \n\n3. Identified if you\u2019re possibly codependent due to your abusive/ toxic upbringing. If you are, join CODA and get a sponsor to start working on that, healing, and changing your patterns. \n\n4. I would refrain from romantic or sexual relationships for a little bit. Often adult children that are raised in abusive, unstable, or chaotic homes, we have a pattern of attracting and getting into abusive relationships as adults. We need to reparent ourselves and learn new and healthy patterns in order to be in healthy relationships. \n\n\nOne mantra that I would repeat to myself daily, MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY, was: \u201ceven though both of my parents treated me horribly, I DESERVE love! I DESERVE to be treated with kindness! I DESERVE respect!! I DESERVE happiness! I am worthy of this just for being alive!!\u201d \n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t believe any of this and it actually made me VERY uncomfortable telling myself this. With some time (almost one year) I slowly started to believe it. Today, I have no doubt in my heart of it and I don\u2019t tolerate anything less from anyone in my life. \n\n\nToday my life is great! It\u2019s nothing like what it used to be like, but it took work. A LOT of work and YEARS of therapy for me to get here. Be gentle with yourself! Give yourself the love and the stability that your parents probably never gave you. Wishing you all the best and sending you a big \ud83e\udd17",

    "postText": "I (35f) have been dating my boyfriend (30m) for about a year and a half. We were both pretty slow coming into the relationship and really took our time with it. My last relationship had caused a lot of damage and his past ones left a few scars for him as well. Because of it all, we really went slow and just enjoyed being around one another. I don\u2019t think when we started dating either of us had plans of it even turning into a relationship. \n\nOf all my relationships, this has easily been the healthiest I have ever been in my life. We have never really fought and maybe had a couple disagreements here or there but they\u2019ve always been talked out. I find that our personalities are both very similar so we enjoy a lot of the same things but are also different enough that we keep each other doing new things or having our own things we can down by ourselves. \n\nHe really is amazing in that he understands me, pushes me while also being patient, has a strange ability to calm my anxiety or stress, and keeps me laughing. Sometimes I feel like I don\u2019t even deserve him and wonder when the shoe will drop so I\u2019ve always held a small part of myself back from him out of fear.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note my partner is in the military and recently deployed for the next six months. I\u2019ll be honest, I had zero interest in being in a relationship with someone in the military because of the possibility of deployment but again, I really never expected the dating to go anywhere. He hasn\u2019t been gone long and it\u2019s insane how big of a limb I feel like I am missing and I dont think I ever realized how big of a piece he had become in my life. I\u2019ve quickly realized how terrified I am of ever losing him and the idea of being without him. With him being gone, I feel like I am finally unable to hide behind my fears as they all have become so glaringly obvious. \n\nWhile I\u2019m terrified of being hurt, I\u2019m more terrified of being without him. I\u2019ve never really wanted to get married, couldn\u2019t really see it in my future. I know now that I want to spend my life with him but I can only hope he feels the same. I have hints from him that he does but we\u2019ve never really discussed it.\n\nI wish I could tell him but unfortunately that will have to wait until he comes home so for now I\u2019m sharing it with you.",

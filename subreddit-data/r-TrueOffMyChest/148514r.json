    "postText": "My best friend(F) for the purpose of this story we're going to call her K, and my Ex(M) will be called J. I(F) dated my ex boyfriend for 2 almost 3 years we broke up a little over 2 years ago but in late February him and I became very close friends again. Also I would like to point out that within the 2 years of me and J being broken up I came out as a lesbian. However within those years of me and J dating he severely damaged my self esteem and sent me into a depressive state that I still suffer with. Me and K have know eachother for 4 years so she met me whilst I was in a relationship with J so she had known everything that he had done to me and the severity of it. Once I became close with J again K thought it'd be a good idea for her to message J and see if he had any bad intentions to harm me in any way before I tried him again, but in this time they grew close and K started to develop feeling for J and allegedly J had already had feelings for K.\n\nIn this time they grew close while I was a already best friends with them both and then K was asked out by J and K said yes. I seemed supportive when she had told me everything but feel down it bothered me, because he was apart of my coming out story and to be honest I was mostly just terrified that J would do to K what he did to me. Within about 2 weeks of K and J dating I had expressed my concerns and K shoved me off and I was told I was being selfish. \n\nOh I also had forgotten to mention that back in November I had tried to get back in touch with J and he called me numerous homophobic slurs and harrased me for being lesbian, so this resulted in me blocking him. K was aware this all happened so when they started dating I asked what she would do if something like that happened again and K responded to me with \"I'd take his side and I'd have to leave you because he's my boyfriend\" and that shattered me to my very core, K is my best friend so I assumed that she would at least support me.\n\nI don't have to many problems with them dating anymore, but I just don't feel super comfortable with the fact she's dating my ex, and I also don't want her to get hurt by him.",

And how was she supposed to know that you are still hurt by him when you were friends (I mean your ex). Love is blind and you don't need to be friends with him to be friends with her. Also the timestamp you mentioned is whole ass 2 years apart from you being with him to her being with him. To sum it up you should just talk with her about your friendship and not post this stuff on Reddit.",

    "postText": "I was away at a festival at the weekend and the instant I arrived I rapidly befriended two people. We got on amazing and were chatting and partying from the afternoon all into the night. \n\nAt one point one of them asked me to search for a song to put on next and they were the only person out of us all that had any signal, so they handed me their phone. \n\nWhen they handed me their phone they'd typed 'I love you' into the search bar which I thought was a really weird name for a song. Later on by a few hours they told me again by voice \ud83e\udd23 but since we had just met I assumed this was platonic. I did not day anything. Being as it could have ended up awkward I just ignored it both times and didn't bring it up again. But now I wish I'd been able to clarify as it's been bothering me. Maybe just over thinking and over analysing. \n\nI also wish I'd just assumed I was understanding of correctly and just said it back. \n\nNow I'll never be able to bring it up or find out. Or say it back. \n\nAbsolutely mega sadness to be home now. \n\nThey won't see this but if they did, I love you as well mate",

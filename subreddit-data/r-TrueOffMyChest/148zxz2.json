    "postText": "Throwaway because I don't want anyone to connect this to me irl. \n\nThey put me through hell for a long time. I could go on about this complicated shit storm this person put me through, but the details would be instantly revealing of who I am to people who know me. So it was just this: There was a breaking point in our friendship when enough was enough and I was done and I haven't looked back, despite them harassing me. \n\nThey are sick. I don't want to go into details, but it wasn't good for a while and apparently it still isn't. For a while I felt that they were living out of spite to keep harassing me. Then it was radio silence for a year. I felt like maybe they were finally done and I could stop looking over my shoulder and dreading people bringing them up. \n\nMy mom called me today and told me they have been unconscious for weeks and they are taking them off the ventilator so tomorrow is the time to say goodbye. \n\nI think my mom wants me (or thinks it may bee good for me since she wasn't pushing in any way) to say goodbye, but I don't want to. I feel like it would be disrespectful to them, myself, and their family to go. Like, \"Hey. I know you've been harassing me for years and I hate you, but here I am to say goodbye.\" As far as I am concerned, I said my goodbye when the friendship ended. I wouldn't want them to show up on my deathbed, why would I show up on theirs? I won't go to this or any services there might be.\n\nIf anything I'd want to tell them what a POS they are, but I don't think it would do me any good. And it comes with complicated guilt. I don't see myself as a person who could tell a dying person they hate them.\n\nI feel weird. Like. I was friends with this person. We had good times. At one point they were the friend that I'd had the longest out of everyone else in my life. I did so much for them. Not out of getting anything in return, but because I cared. Because there weren't a lot of people that did care. They were an important person in my life. I sometimes have dreams where we are friends again, but then I remember. A part of me mourns the friendship, but it is all tainted. The memories come back without the rose colored glasses and I see how bad me and a lot of people around this person were treated. \n\nThey made me despise them. Things that were done and said are unforgivable to me. I've lost friends because of this person. Moments that were supposed to be mine and for me to heal were stolen from me because I had to deal with this person's bullshit. I've lost so fucking much. Things that are irreplaceable and entirely avoidable. I wish I could really communicate the depth of my hatred of this person. \n\nPart of me is relieved they are dying. That will be the official end of it all. I won't have to worry about them anymore. I won't have to think of what the next thing is, or if I have to compile evidence, if I have to think about talking to a lawyer, comfort others who are also experiencing a degree of harassment, my family being contacted, etc.\n\nI don't have to be harassed anymore. For real. I don't have to wait for the other shoe to drop. I won't have people reaching out about what they said about me, or what they are planning to do next. \n\nI can feel free of that burden finally. \n\nBut I feel bad for feeling relieved because that means that this person is gone. I do think there is some good in this person somewhere. I don't know what I believe in. If there is something, I like the idea that we can come back and try again. I hope that they can get a chance at a better life and a chance to be a better person to others next time. I want to believe that good can carry on and be a better friend next time. Maybe in another life we could all be friends again and make better choices. \n\nI know people come in and out of your life for a reason. There are reasons to keep them out. I needed to and I don't regret that. But it may be nice to try again under different circumstances with everyone. \n\nI miss my friends. I won't miss you though.",

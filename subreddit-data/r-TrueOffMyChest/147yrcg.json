Recently I feel like my voice is ringing in my ears after I talk like it\u2019s unfamiliar to me, like when you hear yourself on a recording. And today when I reached for my phone at work i swear it was like \u201cthat\u2019s not my hand\u201d",

You should see your doctor and let them determine whether you need further evaluation or treatment.\n\n(I'm not a doctor, simply someone with a BA and MA in clinical psychology!)",

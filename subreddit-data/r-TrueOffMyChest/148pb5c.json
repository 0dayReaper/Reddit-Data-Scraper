    "postText": "So, the other night I got too drunk. Way too drunk. Way, way, way too drunk. Not only made-out-with-a-stranger drunk, not only almost-went-home-with-him drunk, not only threw-up-on-the-bus-home drunk, but threw-up-in-a-public-bathroom-then-passed-out-there drunk. So, you know, drunk. I didn't think I drank that much but apparently I did, totally my fault, I'm an idiot. Anyway.\n\nI managed to get myself into my own bed eventually (around 5am), and fell asleep. In the middle of the night I woke up and immediately needed to throw up again. For context, my room is VERY messy. Hard to walk in, clothes and plastic bags of different things I've tried to tidy everywhere (I know this isn't a very flattering picture I'm painting of myself). But, fortunately, at the end of my bed was a plastic bag full of rubbish I'd collected to throw out about a week prior. Quick reflexes meant that my vomit went straight in, no spillage, and I left the bag there on the bed and passed out again. One or more times that night I woke up still drunk and threw up in this plastic bag. In the morning, when I was kind-of sober, I picked up the bag, which smelled awful, tied it up super tightly, and put it somewhere in my room out the way. Don't remember where.\n\nWhich brings me to right now, where I planned to dispose of that plastic bag for good. Found it, braced myself for gross - and it's fine. Not only is there no vomit in it whatsoever, it's not tied up at all. I was sure it was this specific bag I threw up in. A quick look around my room and all the other plastic bags I can find are untied and empty of any disgusting contents.\n\nSo... either I drunkenly imagined - VERY vividly, throwing up into the Poundland bag that had within all the pens that have run out from my art supplies, or there is some other plastic bag hidden somewhere in the depths of my labyrinthine bedroom that houses the horrors of my stomach contents from two nights ago.\n\nWill update if I find the bag. I'm terrified.",

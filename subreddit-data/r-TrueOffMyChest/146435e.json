    "postText": "As the title says, i want to work as a mortician and have been wanting to do that since i was 15.\n\nI've been doing researches about this job and people's experiences with it, and despite everything, i really set my mind on this.\n\nNow, the problem is my family and friends being against it. They say i want to work as a mortician for some kind of \"aesthetic\" since i always wear shirts that contain drawing of skulls and i even have a tattoo of a butterfly with a skull in it.\n\nThe reason i want that job is to sort of put my mind at ease to try and understand the concept of death, something that has been tormenting me since i was a kid and i couldn't understand it, but also because i find this job very interesting in general.\n\nI am getting a lot of mean comments from my friends about me being \"cringe\" since they also see this as just a phase or some sort of aesthetic, and all these comments are seriously making me rethink everything as an overthinker. The fact that my parents need to shame me for what i wanna do in life is not making things better either: they feel the need to tell their friends about it, and their friends, beeing good karens, see me as some sort of creep to stay away from.\n\nI don't know if i should reconsider my path or just go with my original plan, knowing that i have half of my family and friends against me.\n\nEDIT: I have come across some VERY inappropriate comments under my post, including some not agreeing with the reason i want to do this job, saying i just wanted to work as a mortician to overcome a fear or phobia and that i'm not even interested in the job. \n\nPlease read carefully before commenting such things, as i do not mention a fear or phobia of death but i clearly mention that, while i would like the job for a better understanding of death and dying, i am also interested in the job in general. \n\nRegarding the inappropriate comments, please avoid expressing your opinion under this post if it contains inappropriate comments not only about me but also about dead people.",

It doesn\u2019t matter what others think of it, yes, it\u2019s a morbid career, but it\u2019s extremely meaningful, you help those who have passed and their families. You give the families a chance to see their loved ones as beautiful as they were alive, one more final goodbye. Nothing can ever replace that, not robots or AI, it will always be a job only a human is capable of. The beauty of the work is being able to provide a sense of closure to the families. Becoming a mortician is something brave to do, you help the living and the dead, and that\u2019s the true beauty of the profession.",

When my dad passed away, my older brother was too sick to really help me with anything as far as the funeral planning (our dad passed from colon cancer and my brother also had terminal colon cancer)- I was in my early 20\u2019s, had spent the last 2 weeks living in the hospital with my dad, and had to handle everything alone. The mortician/funeral director was so kind and helpful in basically holding my hand and walking me through everything. I will never forget his kindness to a grieving, exhausted, and overwhelmed daughter. The industry needs people who want to be there for those people.",

It is true there is no shortage of clients and you will always have a job. \n\nI'm sure there are people in the business who would be more than happy to take some time discussing what working in this line of work entails, the pros, cons and things to think about. There is a lot more than one might initially think and also careers that could be along these lines that may interest you also. \n\nI'm not sure where in the world you live and what it takes in your country to pursue this line of work, but if there are formal qualifications you need, maybe you could get in contact with one of the local education providers and discuss with the appropriate tutors to gain some more insight about what the training might look like and the cost of this. \n\nIn this instance, it does kinda feel like those around you are giving you a hard time unnecessarily, rather than supporting you and helping you make educated choices about your future choices. \nWith this in mind, I'd advise you inform yourself and do whatever the hell you want to make a living. It mat or maynot be you jam and either way is totally ok.",

Do you generally have one firm per cemetary, or have a few for each so people have options? I do live in the states, so it might be different here, not sure. I have noticed around where I live, there's a good deal of variety in stone color and shapes when it comes to headstones in a single cemetary.",

It\u2019s highly sought after, Down south however in dirty old London there\u2019s a lot of white looking sandstone that\u2019s (for the most part) Portland stone which is god awful cheap as chips sandstone quarried off the island of Portland and half of London is built out of it it\u2019s everywhere down there, very brittle and pours which leaves it super susceptible to weather damage but because it\u2019s so soft everyone from the Georgians to the victorians loved working with it  because it was easy to quarry, easy to chisel - so you could be seeing that around - likewise you can get cheap brittle sandstone from Spain which is being used in alot of new build houses locally because it\u2019s dirt cheap, we tend to import most of our granite from China and India and I\u2019d like to believe our marble comes from the beautiful Italy but it\u2019s probably China again, gone on abit of a rant here I think I\u2019ve answered your question, worth googling the Portland quarry it\u2019s enormous",

Definitely become a mortician if you feel like it's your calling.\n\nJust be aware, there is a lot of schooling that goes into it, depending on where you live. You'll have to complete many math, science, accounting, and business classes. I even had to get an associates degree to be allowed into mortuary school and from there had to get my bachelor's degree.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that depending on where you live it's a very male dominated and conservative profession. So no visible tattoos, dressing very modesty in the chapels and with families, and keeping a professional and conservative viewpoint while working, that was quite the lesson for me and I even went into the profession later in life (I'm 29 now and just in my first couple years of the profession)\n\nBut if all that appeals to you and you can handle the workload and being in a field that's very niche and everyone knows everyone, then go for it!",

The person interviewed is a thanatologist and she teaches thanatology to mortuary students. Give it a listen. I think you will find it interesting. It's more about the psychology of accepting death is a part of life for everyone and helping people learn to accept that their own death is coming and helping people get over their fears of death, from what I recall. Good luck. Do what you love and what interests you and don't listen to the naysayers. \n\nhttps://www.alieward.com/ologies/thanatology",

Working in service to your fellow man and treating them with dignity, while others are grossed out is a great feeling. I've always said, if anyone can stomach the job and is intrigued by it...do it!! \n\nI will say, that I worked in the industry for quite a few years, and I did develop ptsd. I spent a long time in therapy to help with the nightmares and I still don't handle the deaths of loved ones that great (like absolute meltdowns with visual flashbacks). And I'm definitely not alone. If you have an empathetic nature, it will get to you over time. Seeing so many suicides and murders, it's impossible to stay sane, if you have any sort of heart. Most long-timers were functional alcoholics and I was on that path before I hot out. \n\nThat being said, I also gained some invaluable perspective that is only available if dealing with mass amounts of corpses. I feel truely lucky to wake up every morning- so many people didn't make it through the night. I am sure to tell my friends and family that I love them every single time I talk to them. I am less judgmental of lifestyle choices, as I have picked up every single age, every single way to die, and when it's your time, it's your time. Live and let live while we're here! And I don't waste time doing shit I don't enjoy. Time is precious and life is very short. \n\nTo sum up, if you're interested in the work, I say, do it! This is your life, don't let others dictate what you do with your time. If they have issues with it, fuck em.",

Watch her videos, and you'll see what I mean.\n\nAs for your family and friends - in the end, it doesn't matter what they think about your career choice. If it brings you satisfaction, and helps you come to terms (at your young age) with the idea that we all are going to die, then keep doing it. If you can bring comfort to people on their worst days, you're doing good in the world. In the end, being a mortician/funeral director is a role that is all about the folks that survive the deceased. Approach it that way, and you'll find it incredibly satisfying. \n\nIt's sad that so many people live their lives so in fear of death that they cannot bear to even consider it. Be proud of yourself for moving towards acceptance of it. After all, when you accept that it's inevitable, it's easier to focus on enjoying the time that you do have available to you. \n\nGood luck, OP.",

Some of us are even pretty good at it, and some of us are *amazing* at it (I'd rate myself as 'pretty good' because I have yet to learn how to do airbrush cosmetics).  \n\nMy advice would be to go to cosmetology school first, and then if you're still interested, go to mortuary school after, a) because the apprenticeship/practicum part of the mortuary licensing process pays *real* poorly, but also b) because then you'll be an embalmer who is *amazing* at cosmetics, and that will make you very marketable.",

Yes, modern embalming practices developed in North America and Europe, but the practice of beautifying and displaying/visiting with the dead is almost a cultural universal, and lots of non-western cultures incorporate embalming into their funeral practices, *because* it allows them maintain their traditions. For example, I used to work with a Filipino guy who is old enough to be my Dad, who was an embalmer back in the Phillipines, and I currently work with a Chinese funeral director (also old enough to be my Dad) who assures me that my skills would be in high demand in Hong Kong. There's also a demand for embalming in Japan, and I know of another guy from the US who runs a non-profit with the goal of teaching &amp; equipping funeral professionals in Africa (I think Kenya or Nigeria, but I'm not 100% sure) to embalm, because it's something that is in demand there as well. \n\nAlso, I don't know if this is just a North American thing, but it's very common for people to have a viewing/visitation prior to cremation - embalming isn't necessarily just for traditional church funerals with a burial. I live in a city with large Asian and Indian communities and so I've embalmed many Buddhist, Hindu, and Sikh people so that their families can do their traditional open-casket ceremonies, which are then followed by cremation. The only religious groups I've worked with that are very strict on the 'burial within 24-48 hours' rule are Jewish and Muslim. \n\n\n\n&gt;full viewing and no embalming set for three weeks in the future. \n\n&gt;That\u2019s a no.\n\nHa! Would you believe that despite the fact that the majority of FD's here also hold an embalming license and should DEFINITELY know better, I guarantee there are people I've worked with who would have told that family \"oh yeah, I'm sure that's fine!\" \ud83e\udee0",

I\u2019m on mobile or I\u2019d type way more, too!\n\nI lived in SE Asia for six years and embalming was unheard of unless you were a westerner.  (This was like 15 years ago so times may have changed.)\n\nIt\u2019s amazing how different the same religions can be in different cultures. \n\nIn America, Jewish unveilings are done at 11 lunar months and I\u2019ve never heard of that anywhere else. Usually it\u2019s just when the stone is finished. \n\nI also see a lot of Catholic cremations, now. Practically unheard of 20 years ago. Probably unheard of in some countries, today. As long as ALL the ashes are kept in one vessel it\u2019s still consecrated. \n\nFDs are usually embalming certified but one of my affiliates runs a pioneer cemetery and still keeps her license current even though she doesn\u2019t do anything with it. I suspect our market is super saturated in this area. It\u2019s nothing like Op\u2019s situation so I really hope they pursue it and make a happy looking for themselves!",

I see it as a job that requires immense empathy, patience, and love for people. Having an interest in death is normal too, they\u2019re just in denial. We all face it one day, and you\u2019re steps ahead to coming to terms with it while helping others. Seriously, got mad admiration for what you want to do. It\u2019s your life and your happiness, and your opinion of yourself should always weight higher than others. No matter who your peers tell framing it as creepy, there will always be people who see you and can admire you as a aspiring mortician. Don\u2019t stress it too much silly overthinker :)",

It is such a critically important job. Granted, it's a job I could never do, but we are truly lucky as a society to have caring people that will do that work.\n\nNever forget that your WHOLE JOB will be to support people in the worst moments of their life and to help make that process a little easier. Shame on anyone who shames you for doing such Noble work.\n\n\nThink about it. The LUCKIEST of us will have to bury our parents.  The UNLUCKIEST of us will have to bury their children.  Yet, unless you and your parents die together, one (or both) of those two things is inevitable.  \n\nMy grandmother buried both of her parents and two of her three children. I can't imagine anything more traumatic than putting my baby in the ground, no matter how old they were when it happened.

H graduated, went off to school, and got a job at a local funeral home.  8 years ago, my brother in law was killed in a freak car accident.  My sister didn't have to do anything but pick the urn she wanted because she went to the funeral home where H works and H took care of everything.  I remember helping my sister with all the final details before leaving after the funeral, and H told ME everything because she'd known my sister for 25 years, and she knew my sister wasn't absorbing any of it.  When another brother in law's father died, they went right back to her.  People may think it's creepy, but it's because they haven't had to go sit down with someone and make decisions like this.  Having that familiar face and someone who truly knows us and cares made all the difference in the world.  Because of the way my brother in law died, H also put in some extra effort so my sister could see him one last time without being traumatized by his injuries, and she does that for all of her customers, but she made the whole process so simple and she was so helpful, and we all know where we'll be going when the next family member in the area passes on.  If this is what you want; go for it.  Be H.  Help people through this transition in their lives, and care for those who can't anymore.

They get the bodies of loved ones looking their best to say goodbye to their families and friends before sending them off with care. It's oddly comforting to think that someday, when I'm dead and gone, my body will be handled well and looked after until it reaches its final resting place. What happens after death is a mystery, but knowing the process that sends us off eases some of that anxiety (at least for me). I actually watched a WIRED YouTube video that was an interview with a mortician, and it completely changed my opinions surrounding morticians and the industry around them. \n\nThat, and there's a constant need for more people in that field of work. Few want to go into it, so anyone who does should really be encouraged to do so! Pursue your dreams and go into the field you want to, regardless of what your family thinks. My sister got a degree in game design and computer science about 6 years ago now.

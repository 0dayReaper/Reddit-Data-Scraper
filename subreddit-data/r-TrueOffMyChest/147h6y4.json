It would be one thing if she came to you and asked or even accused. But to not listen to your side of it or believe you or even make logical conclusions about what could\u2019ve happened, and then threaten to call the cops? That\u2019s way too much. Tell her you\u2019re sorry that her nude got shared but it definitely wasn\u2019t you, but the way she reacted to the whole situation has been a deal breaker for you. Then move tf on. Because this girl is bad news.",

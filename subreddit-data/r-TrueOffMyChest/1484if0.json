    "postText": "It's slightly depressing, but I feel like bad for myself. Why do I give up on everything so easliy? When did effort become such a hard thing to put in. \n\nI'm planning on going back to school again. But after all this time, it makes me think about how things could've been if I didn't give up my first time. I'd probably be almost done. \n\nI know I should take a positive mindset as a new beginning but I can't help but have thoughts like that. \n\nI took the time to figure out what I want to do, at least that's what say because I really just lost the will to do anything, but all I've really figured is that I don't want to work a 9-5 all my life. The idea of it sounds dreadful. \n\nI wish that I could pull myself together and I don't know, feel like most other ppl do. \n\nI just want to be able to try and try again without giving up. \n\nMaybe stop being so doubtful of myself? \n\nI wish I didn't make the simplest tasks so overwhelming for myself.\n\nI need to get my shit together for reals.

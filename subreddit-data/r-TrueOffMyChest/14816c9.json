    "postText": "14F \n\nTW: CSA, Child abuse,grooming,Self harm, suicidal ideation\n\nMy kinda story. \n\nFrom the ages of 1-5, I was raped by my father but I have no memory from it due to my young age. \n\nWhen I was 6, I forgot my school bag and my dad therefore beat me (as he would do when angry at me) and that day I had enough and reported him at school and was sent to foster care for a year before my parents \"convinced\" social services to give me and my sister back. \n\nWe soon moved to South Africa to get social services off our trail. We traveled and I believed that it would all be fine. \n\nEventually my parents decided  to go back to England without me and my sister and so we were raised by my aunt for a year before my parents decided to move us back to England. \n\nAt 7, I moved back to England and began school. Home life still wasn't safe, my parents would fight often and very dramatically. I would have nightmares of CSA and my death.\n\nI had unrestricted internet access and would watch horror videos to cope with life and found it to be a safe space but I would have intense nightmares. \n\nAt 9, my father traveled to a country in Asia and fell in love with a prostitute and began cheating on my mother (who had cancer), I would message my father daily begging him to come home and take care of my mother and love us instead of his prostitute. \nHe would always apologise and say I didn't understand the situation. Whilst he was away my childhood friend had passed away. \n\nAt 10, my parents decided to go on holiday with my family to my mothers home country, when we arrived my parents would argue daily (including at the airports and would threaten to take a plane back home), my father left the holiday early and took my siblings and I's passports with him so we got stuck in the country for a year. \n\n\nWhen I eventually moved back to England at the end of 2018, My parents finally split up  and my dad kicked me and my mother and siblings out and we had to pack all our stuff in bin bags and move away.\nWe moved to a slightly sketchy area but i enjoyed the freedom of walking home from the bus alone and being able to go to the store and I finally felt happier. \n\nMy parents would still hook up even though my dad got married to the prostitute and she had given birth to a son. (The wife lived in Asia still and my dad would visit often) \n\nMultiple times my father would come to my mothers house and tell me that he didn't want to be my dad, then leave. \n\nI rarely switched houses and stayed mostly with my mother. \n\nAt the end of 2018, I spent new years at my fathers and when we came home from the store, 2 thieves stood outside our home and so I ran away. I realised that we had been robbed. The next day my fathers house burned down (unrelated). I had convinced myself we were cursed. \n\n\nWe moved homes and life was still unstable due to my parents hooking up and my mother getting pregnant (didn't carry to term). My dad would come to pick me up for school and I would wait in the car as he had sex with my mother. It hurt me as I knew that he didn't love her and was using her. \nThey would regularly argue about the sex and being used and my dads wife. I always had to listen and I would be used as a messenger. \n\nJump to 2020, I started year 7: \nCovid hit and i began to Self harm and struggle a lot mentally, my parents would still hook up and fight in front of us. \nWhen my dad didn't want to take care of us on the weekends, he would break down my mothers door and leave us inside. \nHe was very scary and I was terrified of him and his anger as he would do everything in his way to scare us and hurt us both emotionally and physically. \n\nNear the end of 2020: \nI spent the weekend at my fathers and my mother texted me telling me she was going to commit suicide, I had to spent time convincing her to stop. I told my father and he laughed at me as I cried and begged to go find her and save her. She eventually went home and apologised. \n\nMy parents agreed to send me to boarding school in South Africa at the beginning of 2021. \n\n\n2021: \nI finally felt safer at boarding and was happier but I still struggled due to my mental health issues and ended up Relapsing a lot. I met an older man who helped me get through tue problems and I began having a crush on him. He would touch me inappropriately even tho I was only 12 and he was above 18. I didn't care because I just needed someone to support me and I was obsessed with him. I struggled with extreme self harm and anorexia that year. \n\nAt the end of the year, my grandma passed away and I flew home to England. \nI viewed her body and struggled a lot with the image of her in my head. \n\nThe older man who I was talking to stayed with me and would support me through my relapse and issues. We began sexting and sexually FaceTiming daily. \n\nMy father continued to physically abuse me and my siblings, so I complied a file of photos and recordings of proof of abuse. \n\nSocial services visited our home and interviewed us all. \nThey concluded that abuse was occurring but never acted on it. \n\n2022: \nI realised that I shouldn't talk to the grown man and cut contact with him. I relapsed and attempted to end my life but failed and never told anyone but struggled with health issues the entire year and was hospitalised 4 times due to health issues (spent 2 months in Hosptial). I fell into an ED wormhole and developed a deodorant inhaling addiction and began vaping as well. \n\nMy father called me to abandon me, I cough with him and told him I hated him and we cut contact. \nA week later he had a stroke and I reached out and tried to put the past behind me due to a fear of loosing him. \n I struggled to keep up in school and was failing most my subjects, i struggled intensely with mental health\n\n\nI continued to relapse until the beginning of 2023. \n\n\n2023: \nmy father had another stroke whilst I was home for Christmas and I had to call and ambulance and I saw him flatline and have multiple seizures. I still struggle with flashbacks of that. \n\nI relapsed in Self harm badly and got caught by my school, they called my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that I was on my own and told me to kill myself if that's what I wanted. \n\nI began talking to my groomer again for confront  but I insisted on no romance or sexual feelings. \n\nI began acting over sexual and giving head to guys that I met for the first time just so I could feel cared abt and warm for a short time when they care.\n\n\nSince then I have been struggling to keep up with: \nmy family's constant increasing issues, \nmy fathers decline in health, \nmy grandmas death, \nMy mental health \nMy body image\nMy school grades \nSelf harm \nSuicidal thoughts \nIntrusive thoughts\nOversexualising myself \nMoney issues \nNightmares from the past \nFlashbacks from everything \n\nAnd more... \n\n\nI'm not sure what to do anymore, I self harm almost daily. I have done badly in all my recent exams even after working hard. I have lost the will to live. I'm tired of living but I can't kill myself as I need to help my family and siblings. \n\nI'm so tired,please give me advice or reassurance.",

            "comment": "I am sorry that you have been failed so many times by the systems meant to protect you. I don\u2019t know much about England, but I think you should keep reaching out to your school for help. you may also be able to legally emancipate yourself as well once you hit a certain age. I understand your concern for your family and siblings, but you can\u2019t help them if you\u2019re dead. you need to get out, and get help. no child deserves to suffer like you have. As soon as you can legally work and drive you should start, so that you can have a savings account. if you cannot emancipate yourself, you should move out once you\u2019re a legal adult. I moved out with barely any money to my name, but i survived. even if it will really really suck for a while, i can\u2019t imagine living alone could be worse than living with your family. your father is a piece of human garbage that deserves to be in jail. you don\u2019t owe him anything. even if he is on his deathbed, and his last wish is to see you, you don\u2019t owe him that. don\u2019t make decisions for other people, do what you need to do to survive. you aren\u2019t cursed by fate to live this life. there are so many decades left for you to live and thrive. you have no idea where your story can take you. there will be a time in your life where YOU get to decide what happens, not your parents. please stay strong. also, side note, PLEASE stop huffing deodorant. Huffing is getting high on the feeling of your brain cells dying. i\u2019m obviously not going to tell you to do other types of drugs instead, but please just don\u2019t do that one.",

I'm not going to say how sorry I am because that changes nothing. I hope you can dig yourself out from this shithole with help of professionals",

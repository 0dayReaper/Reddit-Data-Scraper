    "postText": "I was going to the kitchen to make lunch, since I was feeling hungry and my brother was in the living room, listening to music. Usually, it's not a problem but it was loud, so I asked if he could lower the volume, but for whatever reason(probably didn't care what I had to say, since he was enjoying himself) I asked again, same response. It's only when I tried to do it myself that he decided to look at me and complain.\n\n I told him what I wanted, hoping that he would do it and all he could say was that he preferred it to be this loud to enjoy it, (even though I only asked him to lower it by 10) He says that what I'm eating is light, so I would be going up, I told him that I would actually be staying a little longer but for whatever reason I don't know, he still repeats saying it like he never heard it. He even brings that whenever my music is loud, he would ignore it, even though that has to do with the fact that I don't want to ignore it. I even tried to compromise, but it didn't work\n\nWe dealt with the problem, but I could only think of the entire thing being a pointless argument that I couldn't even at least get what I wanted. I just wanted to relax and put it behind me. I was getting some juice, but my brother had to be himself. He kept talking about how I'm finishing it all. I get what he meant but I didn't want to talk to him, so I told him to be quiet and leave but he starts being sarcastic and then brings up his usual by saying how I should finish it like I finish all the food in the house. I'm chubby, so he says stuff like that, It only ever just annoys me, but I wasn\u2019t in a good mood, so I ended up hitting him.",

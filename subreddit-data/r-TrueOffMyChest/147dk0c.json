    "postText": "I\u2019m moving away from California officially next week. I knew it was going to happen soon, but didn\u2019t think this soon. I originally was stationed here in active duty and decided to stay because I didn\u2019t like the idea of moving back home.\n\nAfter staying here for a year as a civilian and having the chance to save money, I\u2019m moving back home to finish my undergraduate and possibly my graduate degree. I originally left home because I wanted to get my college degree paid for. After getting out the allure of California got to me. Got sucked into a a couple of jobs I didn\u2019t like and almost decided to put school off.\n\nI thought long and hard about it and finishing school is my best bet to set up a decent and comfortable life for myself. Also saving money in the meantime while I finish is important, and quite frankly could not accomplish that here.\n\nI went to the beach yesterday and realized I\u2019ll be leaving soon and I\u2019m not sure how to feel about it. I know it\u2019s the right and smart thing to do, but now all these memories the last 5 years are going to be an old chapter. A chapter I didn\u2019t think would end. A life I thought I would build, the friends I started to make. Going back home will not be permanent, but it will definitely be a while until I make my way back here. \n\nLife might change again though I might find myself somewhere else. I\u2019m not sure. Life is moving a bit fast and I\u2019m just trying to enjoy the moment.",

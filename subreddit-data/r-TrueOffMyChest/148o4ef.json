    "postText": "My brother and his girlfriend came over to our house the other day with their 3 year old daughter. I absolutely love my niece and would do anything for her. Right now they're in the process of potty training her, which I completely understand because I am a mother as well. \n\nMy husband and I just bought brand new couches which wasn't cheap. And they let their daughter climb all over our new couches without a pull up. Now I understand the need to potty train, I truly do, but it was really hard for me to enjoy my family being over while I was on edge about our new couches. \n\nI know they're just material things, but it's not like we could afford to replace them if she did have accident and I sure as he'll no my brother couldn't either. We had only just bought them that day. \n\nMy family thinks I'm over reacting. But my husband agrees with me that it's rude of them. Especially since my parents just recently had to give them a new couch because she accidentally peed on theirs. \n\nAfter typing all this I feel stupid. She's just a kid, but then again I'm not upset with her, more so her parents. FYI, she never did pee on my couch. Which I'm grateful for. Family functions probably won't be happening at my house for a while.",

My wife wound let our kids in others homes without a diaper until they could communicate i need to use the toilet. You see right and as it was brand spanking new, everyone would have felt like crap ( pun intended) of she soiled it. You are in the right! IMO",

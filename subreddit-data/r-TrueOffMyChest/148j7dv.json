    "postText": "Yesterday i said good buy to my ex the last time and i know I\u2019m going to make it the last time. At this point i know i want him in my life desperately for that matter but i know i cant have him because if i do i will be breaking every promise i ever made to myself and everything i ever stand for. How can i take someone back who treated me like that. But i still love him to the point where it physically hurts. How every time all i wanna do is to hear his voice to talk to him to hug him. But when he is here physically with me i feel hopeless i feel like my old self and my guards go back up. Everything with him is so natural. \nThis is the type of pain and suffering no one will ever be able to understand no one. Unless they have loved as passionately as i have. Unless they have given all of it to that person. Heart body and mind. Everything in me wants to be with him but at the same time my body is rejecting his very presence. I cannot stand to look at him but can not keep any the thought of him. Maybe im in love with what was and not the person.  The feeling is addicting its pain. \nFor everyone he is a failed relationship. Something that didnt turn out. \nBut the truth\u2026 \nHe was the one i wanted to marry. The one i asked for by name to my God. He was my everything. \nThis is my punishment to be reminded of him but then simultaneously remember the hurt. The broken trust. With him everything is good but its the worst thing i can do to myself. \nIs he my addiction? Or my-safe space i dont know. All i know is i crave the memory of him..what was.",

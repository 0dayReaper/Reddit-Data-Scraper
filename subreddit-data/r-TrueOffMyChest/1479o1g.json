He was the closest person to me in my life and no one else will truly know me like he did. A part of me is dead now and I'll never be the same. I've been in and out of uncontrollable sorrow, laughing at memories, and pure rage. I miss you so much. You were a beautiful poet, a pure soul, and the best brother you could ask for. The world is truly a darker place without you here. I hope you're somewhere beautiful.",

My brother liked writing deep inspirational words and poems and this one has been helpful for me. Hopefully I can send a little bit of solace your way.\n\n\"Life can be way up high with your head in the clouds and other times way down buried beneath the ground. It's all flowing and going seemingly without a reason. Not everything needs a reason, this is the way it's always been, and shall continue to be. Effected emotionally and physically by the change of seasons, some of them freezing, and others heating. It's the progression of time, soon they will no longer be shivering, and soon the first warm breeze they feel begins to defrost their hearts. They experience a gentle feeling of hope for better times. Continue on living through the dark times because the light eventually breaks through. Keeping your eyes on peaceful days, better days, and beautiful days. Days where the the flow of happiness fills them completely overflowing into the people around them, lifting their heads, giving hope to the hopeless, giving light to people in the darkest of places, and making them feel whole for the first time in a long time. Round and round it goes never staying one place too long it's always on the move until the end of your last day you will spend alive on this earth. That's the day you can finally be layed to rest, no longer will you enjoy life, but no longer will you experience its pain and suffering.\"",

Here's another I really like.\n\nI had a dream that I destroyed everything I wanted.\nI brought it all back and I tried to save it, but the smoke rose up from the coals among the laughter of evil souls.\nApparitions in the smoke of what will become, what will never be, who I am, how you see me, what could of been, and what will never be.\nForming in the coals an absence of light, a place not of this world with a haunting smell of sulphur.\nNo longer are their coals instead a lifeless blackness, it consume all I am, and all that is left around me.\nI'm now completely enveloped in the darkest place I could never have imagined.\nOut comes a man with no flesh from the abyss and a presence that makes god himself shake and tremor.\nI bow down in fear, I drop to one knee, and I embrace my lips against deaths charred fingers. Then I raise up to bestow my crown of pain and tears upon his head and for that it proclaimed \"I shall have everything I lost in my life back as it was before\".",

But it explains grief so beautifully, I had to share it.  \n\n&gt;As for grief, you'll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked, you're drowning, with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it's some physical thing. Maybe it's a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it's a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\n&gt;In the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don't even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you'll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what's going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything...and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\n&gt;Somewhere down the line, and it's different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O'Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you'll come out.\n\n&gt;Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don't really want them to. But you learn that you'll survive them. And other waves will come. And you'll survive them too. If you're lucky, you'll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.\n\nPerhaps this man\u2019s words will help you through such a difficult time. I am so deeply sorry for you loss.  I\u2019m going to leave a hug right here, in case you need one later: *Hug*",

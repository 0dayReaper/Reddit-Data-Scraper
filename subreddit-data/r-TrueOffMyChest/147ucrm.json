    "postText": "I am a 28 year old woman with a baby face. I can pass for 16...if I wear a turtle neck jumper and gloves, because I have two full sleeve tattoos, a chest piece and a tattoo on one of my hands. It seems like now all I have to do is hand over whatever it is I want to buy with my tattooed hand, wear a tank top and bam, legal adult. \n\nMy country does have a challenge-25 law where they have to check our ID if they think we might be under 25 but I guess I don't now! I actually look like a grown adult, and as a baby face late 20s person, this is oddly validating. \n\nNo shade on cashier's for doing their job, but before my hand tattoo I'd have made a really good undercover shopper \ud83d\ude02",

    "postText": "Dear J, \n\nIt\u2019s been almost five years since we last talked. I blocked you on everything. I didn\u2019t want to hear from you. We dated for almost 3 years and in that time we were attached at the hip. We did everything together. You were my best friend in the world, and I thought we would get married. \nI know towards the end of our relationship I was in a bad way, it was still a shock when you left me. I\u2019ve been heartbroken before. This one was different. Even five years later I still think about you every fucking day. I wish I could stop. I kept it down and buried for a while. I slept with anyone I could to try and fill the hole in my heart. I started new relationships and tried to live life. \n\nbut five years on, when I found out I had to see you at a wedding I looked you up for the first time in five years and saw something that destroyed me. \nI was about to skip H\u2019s wedding just because I knew I would see you and your new fianc\u00e9 there. He convinced me to come anyways but the thought of seeing you in the arms of someone else makes me feel so sick. \nI didn\u2019t have my life together and you wanted something different. It made complete sense to leave me, but I have never been the same. \n\nMy girlfriend doesn\u2019t know why I stopped eating and sleeping in the last few weeks. She\u2019s so worried about me and I can\u2019t tell her. I have no one to talk to. I should be over you, but every night I lie awake and think about you. Everything good and everything horrible from the whole relationship flashes in my head. \n\nJ, I hate you for having this much control over me without even knowing it. I hate you for breaking my heart. I hate you for promising forever and then leaving me in the dust. \n\nI want to forget you so bad, but then at night as I\u2019m falling asleep I hear our song ringing in my head. I haven\u2019t actually been able to listen to it since we parted. Kishi Bashi\u2019s voice sounds as real as though it was actually playing. \n\nI remember the long drives up and down the east coast and singing together for hours. I remember walking through forest trails holding your hand. \n\nI remember asking you to marry me by the river and how excited and hopeful you were. I remember kissing under the moon light. I remember your smell, i remember your voice. I hear you in my dreams often. I cannot forget the sound of your voice no matter how hard I try. \n\nI remember the pretty diamond ring  I bought at the pawn shop with all the money I had in the world\u2026.\nI remember you losing the ring in the car shortly before leaving me. Foreshadowing at its finest. \nNow you have a new ring. A more expensive ring I could have never afforded. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m permanently broken and I\u2019m not sure I have the capacity to let myself love someone in such a deep way again. I can\u2019t even remember any fond memories from college because you\u2019re tainting all of them. It\u2019s like a 3 year gap in my life that makes me queasy to even contemplate. \n\nMy life is better since we split. Had we stayed together I might not have pursued my own dreams. I don\u2019t want you back, at least I don\u2019t think I do. But that brings me no comfort. \n\nI hate you so fucking much and I miss you even more. I find myself wishing and hoping that you get your heart broken as bad as you broke mine. But the universe doesn\u2019t work that way.\n\nMaybe I don\u2019t even cross your mind , and I think that\u2019s what scares me the most. \n\nIn October I\u2019ll see you. I\u2019ll smile and you\u2019ll wave. And I know I will only feel worse. \n\nYou\u2019ll never read this and I don\u2019t know who I\u2019m writing it for. But I had to get it out.",

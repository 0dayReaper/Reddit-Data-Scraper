    "postText": "So hey guys, Im 16 rn and I rly wanted to spill this somewhere.. First time poster so sorry if it's a bit messy (also mobile)\n\nSo basically just as the title says, I've been the only adult in the house ever since I was 11yo. I live with my mom (48) my grandma (71) and my grandpa (67). \n\nMy parents are all alcoholics and my mom smokes a lot of cigs too (no drugs tho). Every day after work (from 4-5pm up to 3-4am) they get drunk asf and start fighting with eachother or screaming nonsense or verbally abusing me (physically too when I was younger and couldn't fight back). At this point I learned to hide in my room and ignore them, but it's not as simple as that anymore because whenever my parents are in this state the responsabilities of the house end up falling on me... \n\nThis is a 40yo house iirc. The electric installation and the gas one have never been changed or upgraded since then (we live in a block apartment btw). The first instance of problems started appearing when I was 11. We used to have this old electric control panel thing (idk how it's called in english sorry). Whenever something went wrong the panel would basically melt one of it's components and stop the electricity. Whenever that happened my grandpa used to just replace that component and go on about the day (PS he is NOT a professional technician) Eventually the panel started firing up sparks one night and I told my parents and they disregarded the issue until the panel started smoking. I imediatly closed the lights and stuff in the house and had to BEG my drunk grandma to call up the electricity company we had a contract with to come imediatly and replace the panel. They ended up coming the next day and my parents started screaming at me for ruining their night...\n\nAfterwards as I grew up and as I was fascinated by technology I basically became my parents' IT worker. Every single time something came up I had to fix it, I had to spend hours doing their work and never even got a thank you from them, only drunk people screaming at me and not cooperating.\n\nThen I had to make sure the paperwork for the house was in order when my grandma basically fell in a coma bec of how much she drank and my mom was fighting with my grandpa and the medics that came. A lot of payments and stuff were due soon and since no one else was there to do the work I had to do it to make sure we wouldn't be homeless...\n\nAfter that I basically became their worker all together. Ever since I was 14 I started doing their monthly paperwork for the medical firm my mom owns (she's a private doctor and Im sorry for her patients honestly). Every single month it was the same question. Waste time to work on their stuff, miss time dont finish homework or study, get yelled at for not having good marks and repeat. \n\nOver everything in the summer of 2020 I went through a real fire at our block. It came from a neighbor underneath us and I was there only with my grandpa. I had to make sure the animals got out safe, I had to contact the emergency number because I was the first that noticed the smoke smell. I had to make sure I took money and important identity cards with me (like my own and grandpa's). I got to get out in time too even tho I had to walk thro the dark smoke only to realize I didnt help my grandpa get out and have a whole panic attack because of it. But its not like I could anyways (at the time he couldn't walk and we live on the third floor). The fireman eventually came and settled the situation but I had to be sent to the hospital bec of my bad panic attack. My parents chewed me out for everything when we got back.... Told me Im a drama queen.\n\nOn another instance last year I had to push my drunk mother and grandma away from a light switch that kept malfunctioning so they wouldnt set the whole house on fire again...\n\nIm not even gonna talk abt the 3 almost 4 years I was tortured by bed bugs bec they refused to call a professional to deal with it and I had to spend so much time saving money to afford to do it myself. \n\nAnd lastly but not least, just 30 minutes ago I spent 5 hours working on their paperwork and doing their work for them, even tho now Im getting paid for it, it was EXHAUSTING because they just kept drinking more and more and I was constantly choking with my mom's cig smoke and struggling to explain what information I needed to them. They didnt want to  cooperate like normal human beings and every single time I told them they gave me the wrong information and that I actually needed something else they screamed at me how Im incapable and the government never asked them for these papers before and what not.... \n\nOn short I've been an adult for these people ever since I was 11. This has caused me to act very childish around ppl Im comfortable around and often around others too by mistake. I want to play with toys, I want to go to the park with friends I want to be a child. I want to be happy, I want everything that I was never given at that age. But every single time I try to reover what's been lost Im being called a childish brat and that nobody my age should be into toys or collectibles or cartoons and nobody my age should act like that. Im so tired of this, I want a break... I just wanted to be a normal child...",

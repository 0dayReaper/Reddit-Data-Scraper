    "postText": "Burner account, for obvious reasons. \n\nI don't really know what I expect to get from posting this to Reddit, but I don't think I'm able to carry it by myself. \n\nMy husband and I have been married for nearly 5 years, together for roughly 8 or 9. Overall it's been a great relationship, I've never felt that we've lost the spark, we do lots of fun things together all the time, have shared goals and ambitions and we work very hard toward achieving them together, very much an equal partnerships, fairly healthy sex life though his drive is higher than mine and he can be cranky for a whole day if he wakes up with a boner and doesn't get sex. He can have a bit of a short fuse, but has never directed any anger at me. Generally it's at inanimate objects (picture a mechanic whose project isn't going to plan). Normal occasional tiffs and differences of opinion, but nothing that we haven't been able to have a cool headed conversation about and work through. \n\nA few years back, before we were engaged, I found him messaging with people he had met on KIK. Inappropriate messages, dick pics, the works. I was devastated, but insisted that we sit down and talk it out, which we did, and we moved on. Since then, maybe once every year or so, I'll get a wild hair up my ass and open up his phone just to peek at his conversations to make sure they're all above board, and up until a month ago, they have been. I always get a little chuckle out of him having very boring and expected conversations with friends, but this time I found that he had downloaded KIK again, and had been having the same types of conversations as before, as well as sending flirty messages to a girl he used to know, on social media.\n\nI called him on it, and instead of confessing, he lied to me about the conversations, and tried to delete them before I could see them. Unfortunately for him, I had already seen enough to know exactly what he deleted. I sent him out of the house to sleep in our trailer, and told him I would not be attending the upcoming family wedding we were meant to attend in his hometown, and he would need to explain to his closest family members why his wife was not in attendance with him. He was broken, and he complied. Two weeks or so later, I allowed him back in the house. \n\nThen, this past weekend, I had a feeling, so I opened his phone again. Shame on me, I know. I found he had an app meant for storing photos and videos with a passcode for entrance. I asked him what one would need an app like that for, and he responded by lying to me, again. He told me that the app had come on his phone (one of us has an android and the other has an iphone, so we aren't as familiar with the other's phone as our own), and that he didn't use it, and didn't know the passcode. I could see the storage used on the app, so I used his phone to reset the passcode, and got into the app, which he clearly had been using. Turns out he had found some app where you can take photos of people's faces, and put them on nude bodies? Weird, but I honestly probably wouldn't have been ridiculously upset, had he not blatantly lied to me, to my face, again. He says he was too embarassed to tell me. I pointed out that at this point, he should be prioritizing honestly over literally anything else, if his intention was to remain married.  (For the sake of clarification, please know that I have no qualms whatsoever with porn, of any sort as long as it's legal. I watch porn on my own, he watches porn, sometimes we watch together. Just for clarity, porn in and of itself is not an issue in our household.) We got into a fight, I sent him to the trailer, but then we ended up talking and I allowed him back in the house. We both started therapy, upon the previous finding on his phone, and he made very clear he had every intention of putting in the work to remain in the marriage. On my part, I simply cannot fathom how a divorce would play out, how I would afford to exist on a single income, and many other factors like the fact that we live in an incredibly rural place and as such maintaining our home takes a lot of physical labor, a minimum of two people, and we each have access to different parts of things that we need to survive - he has access to laundry through work, as well as water since we don't have running water. When I say rural, I mean very rural. I told him that he could stay, and that at this point if I made him go stay in the trailer, I don't think I would ever allow him back in the house, so for the sake of continuing our marriage he should just stay, though I wasn't sure at this point that I would be capable of loving him since clearly I could not ever trust him. I said some mean things to him, but we both cooled down, we both apologized for our respective faults. \n\nThe next day we talk, I want to make sure I'm being respectful of his needs to, and he's happy and feels comfortable. We talk about him having more time to spend with his friends, I'm surprised he's never voiced this desire earlier and obviously am a-okay with it. For the love of god, please, yes, go hang out with your friends - I do? Why wouldn't he be able to? And we talk about a handful of our smaller hang ups, as a check-in to make sure everyone is happy and we are communicating our needs to each other. \n\nThat night, we're sitting on the couch and I ask him to hand me his phone, and I'm looking through it in front of him, telling him if he's got anything else I might find, to please let me know before I find it. Not a peep from him, so then I Find a cancellation email from Ashley Madison, charges on his accounts for Tinder, and apparently a charge from the photo app that created the photos that filled his locked photo storage app. He tells me that he was also on Grindr, and that he was essentially using all of these apps as \"interactive porn\" and nothing else, that he never had any intention of meeting up with anyone, he was just \"horny and stupid\". I do believe that he never intended to meet up with anyone, however the issue at this point is the fact that he continues to lie to me, despite knowing that our marriage was already very much in jeopardy. He continued to hide things, and lie to me. I sent him out to the trailer, told him to take off his wedding ring, and essentially told him we are separated from this point on. He begs for a chance to prove to me how much he loves me (I've been giving him chances this entire time, what has he been doing with them?), and insists that he will do the work in therapy, and that he wants to seek help and get better and treat me better. That he loves me. I told him that this is not what love is, this is not how you treat the people that you love, and at this point I would be doing myself a disservice by allowing him to stay in our home with me, that at this point I need to prioritize myself, and respect myself enough to kick him out. \n\nI am just broken. I don't know what to do at this point. I still, somehow, cannot fathom following through on divorcing this man who cannot stop finding sexual gratification outside of our marriage, and lying to me about it. The worst part is, we've been open in the very distant past, and we have very open and non-judgmental communication about sexuality, our sexual needs and desires, and all the things of that nature. I did ask him about that, and he said in different words that he didn't want an open relationship because I would have an easier time picking up partners than he would, simply because I am more outgoing and not intimidated by potential sexual partners and in person, he is. It pains me that he didn't feel safe enough to communicate his needs and desires with me. And I just do not know how to proceed. We own a home, but it isn't yet paid off. We are in the middle of countless home improvement projects, we have plans for literal years out. I love his family, his family loves me. We have amazing adventures together, and friends we love to adventure with. Thankfully we have no kids or pets to consider, but it all just feels so overwhelming. I haven't been able to bring myself to tell any of our friends, because I don't want people to think poorly of him, and it's also incredibly embarassing for me as well. \n\nSo, here I am, yelling into the internet void.",

He certainly seems to have the intention; porn is one thing, but hookup apps and Ashley Madison show a clear objective.",

During the time frame in question, we were together basically all of the time, save for a sprinkling of random weeknight dates I had with girl friends. All weekend adventures, we did together, and with friends. There are no clubs or bars really, where we live. Hell, the nearest real grocery store is over an hour away.

Lots of inappropriate interactions on lots of porn and dating sites, personal profiles, dick pics, exchanging nudes, whole conversations, hidden apps, hidden devices, spending money for personalized content, you name it. He would lie, I would have an intuition to search, and I'd find, he would lie more, try to delete it, we would fight, I would cry, hed say sorry, even got rid of his phone for a while, but it would always happen again. It was awful. I became some fucked up version of a detective, spending hours every day searching online for his profiles, going thru bank statments, phone records, and rummaging thru the damn trash. \n\nI begged him to get help, then I demanded he get into  counseling or I'd walk.  The sex had gotten real weird too, I assume because his porn was getting weirder because thats how addiction works- they build a tolerance. He became increasingly aggressive and violent and basically abusive. I remember a time he physically fought me and left bruises everywhere trying to wrench his phone from my grasp.\n\nSo he *pretended* to go to counseling and I fell for it. Not once but twice. The first time I told him I was leaving him he \"went to counseling\", and I later found out it was a lie.  I dont even remember how now, there were too many lies to keep up with. The second time occurred after I found his secret tablet so I physically separated and we went to marriage counseling as a last ditch effort to save the marriage, he went into personal therapy and sexaholics anonymous. Well I discovered a fed ex receipt in the trash when he sent his sweater to some woman he was talking to, and found the bills for months worth of therapy no-shows. He had lied the whole time we were in marriage counseling, making up the conversations he was having in \"therapy\". Later a sheriff informed me he had been to my house before and met my then-husband, because he was involved in an online dating site extortion. I'd had no idea, it was like I'd been married to a stranger.\n\nSo what I'm trying to say is, it is a sickness, the addiction is real, and he won't change until he wants to. There is nothing you can do to make him stop. Addiction is an illness that affects *everyone* around the addict, but it does not have to be YOUR life. For me, the way I described it was like he was chipping away at our love, bit by bit, until there was nothing left but dust-  there wasn't anything for me to hold onto. \n\nThe good news is, if you decide to leave, you are taking your own mental health and well being into your own hands, which is incredibly empowering. We were together 13 years, married for 9, with a small child, owned a home, had built our lives together- but found I didn't miss him as much as I really really really didnt miss being tortured daily. Therapy helped a ton because I was pretty damn depressed for quite a while, but I don't ever regret leaving him, just not leaving him sooner. \n\nThis is what happend to me, it doenst have to be what's for you. There's resources and support groups for partners of sex/ porn addicts.  S-Anon is a great place to start, whether you decide to stay or need to go. Dm me if you like, and again, I'm truly sorry you're being treated this way. You don't deserve it.",

That indicates he's obsessed enough that even the very real threat of getting caught can't stop him. Now that I'm thinking about it, the hiding, lying, compulsive actions, the pleas when found out, the fact that each time he falls back into the same behavior, it's all typical addict behavior. Sexual wishes and desires are one thing, but what your husband us doing is not that. It's not healthy. It may be bordering on a sex addiction. And not opening the marriage primarily because you'd find more partners, that's really not the reason you want to hear. Oof. \n\nI understand you don't want a divorce. Trying to fix things should generally be the first course of action. However, don't walk over your own feelings. This is totally not OK and he really hurt you. And he's broken your trust numerous times. But there needs to be trust if you want to continue the marriage. When you talk about it, you want to stay together for mostly practical reasons. But you should also think about the long run. Will you be satisfied with a marriage of convenience? What about any kids that might come? Do you have confidence he will be a good and trustworthy dad? A good example of how you treat your wife? What will you do when he doesn't change? You need to be prepared for it to not work out. Therapy is definitely a good idea. He needs to put in the work. But if he can't change, you need to have a plan B. You can't handle going through this every year for a couple more decades.",

The idea of addiction has actually come up in conversation with my closest friends with whom I\u2019ve shared what\u2019s happening, but I didn\u2019t want to attribute his actions to that without further insight into the matter. Though, I do have two close friends who have been married to addicts, and just today they shared the same sentiments. He seems open to the fact that he needs help, he seems open to actively seeking help and putting in the work it takes to get it. He is looking into a porn addicts anonymous website and hopefully the meetings that go with it. \nThankfully we have no intention of having children, so that will never be an issue we will face. It is simply my own emotions I\u2019m looking after here, and for that I am very grateful. \nI always assumed that since his father is a functioning but very heavily addicted alcoholic, and has ruined his own family dynamics due to his addiction, that an alcohol addiction would be what I should anticipate working with my husband through. It never occurred to me that addiction can and does present in other forms. But, here we are, and as I wade through this I\u2019m getting the feeling that you may be hitting the nail on the head.",

Period. \n\nHe shot down the open relationship idea because he\u2019s selfish, he doesn\u2019t want to be truly open with you, he wants to continue to cheat, while keeping you from doing the same or having a honest and open fulfilling relationship. \n\nDo NOT take him back unless you\u2019re looking for a dishonest \u201copen\u201drelationship that\u2019s only open for him and completely closed for you. An \u201copen\u201drelationship is all you\u2019ll ever have with him weather you know about it or not. He\u2019s a liar nothing he says or does can be trusted. \n\nI\u2019d also like to add another lie I hope you\u2019re not buying is that in no way is Ashley Maddison or tinder \u201cinteractive porn\u201d if wanted that with zero chance of meeting up, he could\u2019ve paid for a few onlyfans. \nHad anyone offered to meet him he 100% would have gone. \n\n\nHe proved time and time again that he is not willing to be honest or faithful. \n\nThe marriage you once had is over, weather you divorce or not.",

No hook up sites but definitely a massive porn situation and purchasing onlyfans account access to females we knew from high school (I also have no issue with porn and watch it myself, but this was well beyond a normal once a week horny situation type thing) I hope that you don\u2019t feel alone in this situation. Social media and the internet has made it so easy for people to seek instant validation and gratification.\n\nThat being said, in my opinion (I\u2019m no professional) he needs to seek outside help to get to the root cause of his issue. Sex addiction? Insecurities? Trust and respect are two important things in a relationship and I feel you\u2019ve had both of those things taken from you when he\u2019s been given chance after chance but is offering no real change. It\u2019s exhausting and unsustainable to try and stay in a relationship when you feel you can\u2019t let your guard down, have to check their phone, etc. a persons word is everything. \n\nHugs to you, I\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019re going through.",

But if  \u201cstealing time\u201d isn\u2019t such a crime ( not much of it at least). Then it\u2019s pretty harmless fun exchanging pictures and dirty messages.\n\nWhat if you got an account on one of those apps and interacted with him on it anonymously?  Super easy role play- just slip into another identity with a new username.\n\nFrom the sound of it he has a fantasy and you have the opportunity to engage him in it ( at least it would let you know if he ever would meet up with someone should he make an attempt to cheat on you with yourself - very sitcom-esque.\n\nFrom the sound of it you don\u2019t want a divorce and considering where you live the pickings probably aren\u2019t great for either of you - try indulging in this fantasy of his and maybe you both can get off?\n\nThis is Reddit so the first option on the table is always divorce - but what about imperfect marriages?  I know it\u2019s easy to condemn him ( fun too) but he has this thing on the side that gets him off when you\u2019re not in the mood - if he\u2019s not actually meeting up with people behind your back - really what\u2019s the harm, and maybe you can explore some new fantasy\u2019s too?",

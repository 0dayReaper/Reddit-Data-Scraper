    "postText": "Hello there, it's been a year since I posted my story with my mother. I honestly forgot about it but I saw my story on tik tok and I was like huh that sounds familiar.\n\nOf course a lot of things happened, I want to start by saying that me and my boyfriend are still together, regardless what some people said that we'll broke up. We planned on moving together in 3 months and I'm happy then I've ever been.\n\nOn my mother side of the story, as many of you suggest that she cheated on my dad, well you were right. Me and my brother found texts on her phone from another man, we confronted her and she said she'll stop, and well she did stop, she said there was only text and my brother and I decided not to tell our father, as he have hearts problem ( stupid and I know not the best decision) but he eventually got to know this from mom and he forgive her. She told him because she thought we will told him and got angry at us.\n\nMy relationship with her is still rocky, one day I asked her why she thinks that I will broke up with my boyfriend. She then told me that when she went to a church in mountains there was a little place with a lot of icon with saint on them and she picked 2, one female and one male, and from then on she is convinced that the name of the male saint will be my husband (yikes). Of course my boyfriend didn't have the same name and that's why she thinks he's not the one. (And not even the face because the saint is blond and my bf is not double yikes)\n\n I decided to keep low contact with her as I think is the best option. My boyfriend don't care about her opinion because he knows that they will not affect me and that he trust me, god I love this man.\n\n\nThis is for now, I hope I wouldn't have to update this ever again. Take care of you all. Thank again.\n\nEdit: Reposted for reformatted for easier reading",

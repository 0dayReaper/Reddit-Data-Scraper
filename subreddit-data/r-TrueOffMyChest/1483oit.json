    "postText": "It was a year long relationship and we are both over 30 so we knew what we wanted. It was easy being with him and talking to him. Our fights never turned bad coz we both have a habit of apologizing first.\n\nAnyways I thought he was serious about me but he went back to his ex and broke up with me. We had planned to get engaged 4 months ago. I was sad and frustrated at first. After he broke up with me it felt like he was never my boyfriend but he got the  benefits of having a gf. He was never over his ex and he had lied to me. \n\nBut it\u2019s been 3 months since the breakup and today I am happy and relaxed. I deserve someone who would give 100% coz I do the same. I just feel so different today. \n\nI don\u2019t even care about him anymore. I don\u2019t care what he does anymore. I don\u2019t care if he got accepted to the grad program he applied. We have mutual friends so I will meet him and his gf at a friends baby shower event this weekend.  I am glad I am no longer attached to him. I started June 1st with unfollowing him and his family on social media and I am ready to move on. I am ready to start new chapter from tonight.",

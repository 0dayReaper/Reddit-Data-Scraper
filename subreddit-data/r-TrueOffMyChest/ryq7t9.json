    "postText": "I'm an adult ICU nurse and I get to see just how fucked up Healthcare is on the outside AND inside. Today I had a patient get extubated (come off the ventilator) and I was so happy that the patient was going to survive and have a decent chance at life. We get the patients tube out, suctioned, and put him on a nasal cannula. Usually when patients get their breathing tube out, they usually will ask for water, pain medicine, the call light..etc. Today this patient gets his breathing tube out and the first thing he says is \"How am I gonna pay for all this?\". I was stunned. My eyes filled up with tears. This man literally was on deaths door and the only thing he can think about is his fucking ICU bill?! I mean it is ridiculous. The fact that we can't give EVERY AMERICAN access to free Healthcare is beyond me and makes me want to scream at the top of my lungs. I feel like it's not ever gonna change.",

I let it heal on its own in some messed up way that I have to live with for the rest of my life. Because I didn't want to find out how much my insurance would actually cover and what I would have to pay. Ill pay whatever cost if my kids get hurt. But I just hide mine because I feel like I'll be alright and I don't want my wife and kids to know.",

A few years ago I had a hysterectomy, and approximately three days afterward, I blacked out in my kitchen and split the back of my head open.     \n     \nOnce I regained consciousness, I called 911 &amp; was immediately brought to the ER via ambulance. I was soaked in blood, &amp; the ER doc said that they needed to staple the wound shut. I asked him to numb my scalp, but he declined, saying \"it will be 2 quick bites\"      \n     \nIt was 7 agonizing staples to the head. Plus, he didn't irrigate the wound, or clean the back of my head in any shape or form, ultimately stapling my bloody hair into the wound.     \n     \nI was in the hospital for 3 days afterward, and at no time did anyone wash the back of my head. I wasn't even allowed to get out of bed to pee without a nurse's assistance, so I couldn't just clean myself up. The back of my hair was matted with dried blood as they would periodically assist me in walking up and down the Halls because I had such a serious concussion. The doctor even mentioned, very casually, that I had lost so much blood that he almost gave me a blood transfusion.     \n     \nI ended up with a massive infection at the wound site, and one day, as I was cleaning out the wound (post staple removal), it all kinda came out, and I touched my fucking skull.      \n     \nI will never trust another emergency room doctor ever again.",

She got to pick out what she wanted to wear, what songs she wanted to play. I can\u2019t imagine doing that kind of work. \n\nEven though this was a tragedy, and still haunts me as well, my friend has commented she couldn\u2019t not imagine just getting the phone call your child has passed in an instant.

So a few years ago, in the US under US health care, she thinks it\u2019s time to deal with it. Went to first doctor and he refers her to someone else, then charges her co-pay of a couple hundred bucks. Second doctor checks her out and sends her for tests/x-ray, then charges a couple hundred bucks co-pay. Tests are done and we get a huge bill. Goes back to doctor for follow-up and schedule for operation. All this has happened over about 3 months and operation is scheduled a few weeks later. She misses the appointment. Schedules again for a couple months later. By this time she\u2019s on her way to Vietnam for family visit. I head there about 2 weeks after her. At some point, i ask about the bone growth. She said it\u2019s already done. She saw a doctor in Vietnam a couple of days after arriving, then got the operation about a week after that, before I got there. I looked at the place on her face by her eye where it used to be. Didn\u2019t see any scars or anything. They went in through her eye and ground it down. Didn\u2019t even cost anything.\n\nIn Vietnam, we don\u2019t call ourselves the greatest country in the world or anything. We don\u2019t even boast about having the best of anything. Not even the best Vietnamese food. And we complain about everything, including our health care. We think Westerners, including Americans, have the best.",

So my bf learned how to do his daily wound care so he could stay home instead of living the rest of his life in misery. Fuck our health care system. \n\nAlso, not as bad, but just earlier today I tried to make an appointment for a nutritionist. They take my insurance, and was setting me up an appointment, until they learned it was an eating disorder (arfid) Apparently insurance won't cover that, told me to go to a therapist. My therapist is who recommended I go to the nutritionist. They'll take you if you want to loose weight, but not for a disorder that's affecting your life. Ugh.",

Or someone that was saved by medicine, we are all aware medicine works that is not up for debate. We are mad that the costs keep going up Dr. Are not being paid that much more, and the care often is subpar and rushed. Also, a bandaid does not cost 5 bucks or 500 bucks. You also cannot shop around for the cost I have tried it is a lie.",

I also work in health care and am aware of the skill and such.

It used to cost pennies to have a baby or for surgery compared to the cost of a house or car, now my baby\u2019s NICU stay has me in debt for 65k because insurance dropped while I was in hospital (single mother, only one with healthcare as a hospice nurse at the time). I started doing hospice because I couldn\u2019t take the real life consequences of what was happening to the patients. I had one in hospice who had planned out his insulin doses until he ended up icu and losing all four limbs after sepsis (already had an aka) was 32 years old and could not afford insulin and his supplies (wound care, meds, nursing etc, his wife made too much but not enough) we gave all we could, he was a charity patient but he died and had a small child. I lost it after that shit and had to stop working for awhile. I have seen some horrible things in my career but seeing that hurt me to my core. I have watched 16 yo cry over their mommas body who suddenly died of cancer because they couldn\u2019t afford to get treatment or even checked out in the first place. I hope with corona there will be some small saving grace that comes from it in the healthcare world. Get rid of big pharma (I believe in drugs and medicine 100%) but the cost is ridiculous.

They will charge what the market will bear and they know people will pay any price to not suffer and die so, they charge any price they want. They all keep their prices secret so that people can't price compare and demand that people buy their services at a price they will only reveal after you've been served. They can get away with this because they know you have to agree when your life is at risk.\n\nCan you imagine anyone buying any other product this way? \"How much is this iPhone? I'll tell you after you buy it. Could be $1000. Could be $40,000\". Nobody would ever agree to buy any normal product this way but medical people know you're trapped.\n\nFire fighters would also do this, if they were for-profit companies. While your kids were trapped in your burning house, they'd make you sign an agreement to pay whatever they wanted before they'd rescue your kids. This is why fire fighting isn't run by for-profit companies. \n\nSome thing simply can't be part of the free market because they become extortion rackets, like medicine has become.",

Everyone agrees that it is a problem.\n\n\nImagine if everyone cancelled their insurance, or if everyone protested at every manufacturer / big pharma that excessively charges for simple medications like insulin and epinephrine....\n\nIm beyond done with it and wish we could all get together and actually protest it, because all we seem to do as a society is roll with the punches. I lost insurance this year because I cannot afford it. Its 500$ a month for me and my wife and we have a 6000$ deductible.... We get no healthcare until we spent 6k in one calender year, while paying another 6k just in our premium.\n\nWe have opted to go without healthcare because otherwise we wouldnt be able to afford rent.\n\nTo top it all off, I work in private aviation and see the egregious amount of money that is spent by many of the pharma companies.\n\nThese companies are profiting off of people having heart attacks, strokes, and all other medical conditions.\n\nYou spend your whole life saving money, and you end up losing your entire estate to medical bills as you inevitably need health care at the end of your life..... \n\nFuck this system\n\nEnd rant",

About 3 hours.\n\nTotal time actually being seen? 1 hour.\n\nCost of that trip? 600 big ones, and they didn't even fucking do anything. Still had to pay for the prescription, too, so if you want to count that it's like 675.\n\nWhen I went to the podiatrist, I was in and out in an hour, they pulled out the nail, cauterized the hole so it would never happen again, and billed me 300 bucks for actually doing the job.

Thankfully my wife and I were in positions in the US where during the times we needed it we both had good health insurance through our employers, but even so the French system is better in many ways. \n\nJust an example: my wife had to have a minor but emergency surgery while we were living in the US. The surgery took about 45 mins and she was in the hospital for 3 days total for recovery and monitoring. We only had to pay around $4k but the total bill ended up being almost $40k. For reference this was in NYC. \n\nFast forward several years later and we live in Paris. My wife comes down with a pretty severe case of pneumonia for which they end up hospitalizing her. This was before she was integrated into the social system here so she did not yet have insurance. She was also there for 3 days and the total cost to us was the cost of transport back and forth from the hospital several times. The social worker at the hospital managed to get all charges either waived or deferred until her integration into the social system came into effect. And with the socialized medicine here, costs in general are very affordable. \n\nObviously this is just from my personal experience but it still amazes me when I speak with my french friends or coworkers about the US health system just how in awe they are that it could actually be that dysfunctional and expensive. And before anyone jumps in saying that we pay massive taxes or have to wait for care: my taxes here including social contributions and income tax amount to 1-2% more as a percentage of my total income than I was paying in NYC and includes healthcare as well as several other really beneficial social safety nets. In addition, you do not have to wait for important or vital treatments; it is generally only elective treatments for which there can occasionally be wait periods.\n\nThere are definitely things I miss about the US, most importantly my family. But until the US gets its act together regarding healthcare I don't see myself going back.\n\nP.s. healthcare workers - thank you for all you do.",

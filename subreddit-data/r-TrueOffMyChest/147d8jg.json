    "postText": "3 weeks ago, I had my life together. I would get up early, actually had things to do within the day, my confidence had gone way up and I genuinely felt happy. \n\nI don't even know why but for some reason about two weeks ago I fell and have not been able to pick myself back up no matter how hard I try. I started SHing again, after a few years of being clean and it's worse than it has been (almost needed stiches.) \n\nI've attempted to OD twice a few days ago and last week but have been caught on both occasions. Had serveral mental break downs, in front of people too which I am so embarrassed over but I am becoming so so vunerable. I got broken up with too and made sad attempts of begging them to stay but they wouldn't. I barely feel alive anymore. I cannot bare my own thoughts they are driving me crazy and each time I try to explain what my thoughts look like to my therapist suddenly they disappear and no words come out. I AM SO TIRED and would do anything not to hate my entire existence for just a day. People are starting to notice the change in me and it makes me sad, but then I realize they also likely have no intentions of checking up on me or anything, which I don't blame them for. I thought this was a depressive episode but this has lasted longer than any of my previous episodes. I'm ready to give up on myself. Thank you for listening to me dramatically crying on reddit. :)",

I struggle with those 2 things and realized I was such a fucking loser because of undiagnosed sleep apnea and ADHD. I am not saying these are your issues I was just trying to help you find your underlying issues. There is always a secret undying issue why we act out like this usually trauma or physiological issues or both(me)",

    "postText": "Before I start, I want to preface that I am not suicidal and I am already seeing a therapist to work through a lot of my personal issues.\n\nEver since I realised I was gay as a teenager, I have felt a deep hatred towards myself and did everything I could to not be gay. I watched conversion therapy videos on YouTube and I would hurt myself after I ever watched gay p as a form of repentance. I met a girl who I fell in love with and I thought that would be enough to get me through the rest of my life, but it wasn\u2019t.\n\nNow that I\u2019m out, I outwardly portray that I love myself and that I\u2019m confident, but I\u2019m really not. Internally I still pray that I would be straight so I didn\u2019t have to feel the way I do. Life would simply be easier. I don\u2019t fit with a lot of the current day queer culture and I find myself constantly at this crossroads where I have to face who I am but I don\u2019t like what I see.\n\nI have a boyfriend now and he is absolutely my best friend and everything I want in a partner. But I don\u2019t think I will ever stop seeing straight couples showing their affection and not feel jealous that it can\u2019t be me.",

I get that there is a lot more acceptance in the world, but I don\u2019t ever see a world where I would be able to walk down the street showing affection to my partner and not have someone take a double glance at it.\n\nI am so envious of those that never have to question anything about themselves. They fit the mold and they never have to think about the things I do. I would over analyse how I spoke, how I stand, how I laugh, what my interests are, how my interactions could be construed. It was so tiring, to the point that I\u2019m now 30 and I still don\u2019t really know who I am without it being a reflection of what I want people to think I am.",

I worked with celebrities for years and you would be amazed at how many of those people were *cripplingly* insecure. No matter how rich, famous, beautiful, straight, whatever you are\u2026 real happiness only comes from within. Self-acceptance is a journey and for me it didn\u2019t come until my early 30\u2019s after lots of therapy, including some alternative therapy.\n\nAlso, you mentioned not feeling like you fit in with the current queer culture. Please know that\u2019s totally okay! There\u2019s something painful but beautiful about not quite fitting in anywhere - it means you have something special to offer to the world and if you try to fit perfectly into a little box you\u2019ll never shine the way you\u2019re meant to.",

It\u2019s not easy but it\u2019s so worth it! \n\nYou seem really kind-hearted so I want to give just one more lil piece of advice if I may! Sometimes when you\u2019re kind, it\u2019s easier to be motivated for other\u2019s behalf than your own. So when it feels too hard to love yourself for your own sake, remember that by learning to accept yourself and show it to the world you\u2019ll be able to help so many other people do the same! I have a whole collection of tutus that I love to wear and for years they stayed in my closet bc I was self-conscious. But eventually I found the courage to wear them to work and before I knew it my whole office (where everyone had always worn mostly black) was wearing Hawaiian shirts, sparkly pants, all kinds of fun stuff:) Just a silly example but hopefully it helps a little.",

I'm smart enough to be able to manage a decent WFH job. I'm not divorced with kids on top of being sick. I'm better off where I live than in many parts of the world where I may not even be alive. Being sick is still a big part of my life, but I don't feel like a victim any more. It just is. If I ever spend too much time ruminating about what I'm missing out on, I just visualize the thought as a hot coal that I'm holding. It's the wolf you choose to feed, you know?\n\nAnd you don't have to identify with the gay community or anyone else to be happy as a gay person. Life is more about finding connections wherever you can with family and friends, or a sewing club, or a board game group and your own projects.\n\nBeing gay can be challenging, but it's never going to be the primary reason you're unhappy. Thinking something else would make you happy, especially something you can't have, will 100% of the time.",

It takes one person to be anti lgbt and find out that I\u2019m gay to just put two and two together.\n\nWhen I came out I was absolutely determined to not let it change me and that my sexuality would not be a defining factor of who I am, just a part of who I am. But the more I go on, the more I realise that I just don\u2019t want to be judged anymore\u2026 that\u2019s why I really do wish I was straight.",

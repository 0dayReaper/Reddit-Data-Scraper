    "postText": "I (M32, UK) had an MRI for an unrelated issue and they happened to also find a cyst in my temporal lobe. My consultant referred me to a neurologist who I\u2019ll see next week. \n\nMy partner and family are getting quite stressed about it but it could be nothing, apparently it depends on the type of cyst, its location, size and whether it is growing. \n\nI\u2019m getting married next month and even though it is likely harmless, I feel like I\u2019m walking around under a cloud and I just cannot concentrate on anything. I\u2019m not sure whether to feel silly that I feel this way, but I\u2019m acting with everyone like I\u2019m fine.",

    "postText": "About almost a year ago I got into a fight with one of my friends over a guy. \nFor context: my friend had a boyfriend whom at the time she was sick of, she told me that she was bored and she loved him less. She met someone new and started developing a crush with the guy and then they started flirting and talking while she was still dating her boyfriend. This was very difficult for me to support her because her boyfriend was also my friend and I didn\u2019t like seeing him getting cheat on but I couldn\u2019t also tell him and betrayed her. I tried to come up with a compromise and told her she need to choose one if she doesn\u2019t love her bf any more she should break up with him that way he can finally she can be with that new guy because I hate seeing my guy-friend getting hurt like that. She did break up with him and continued talking to the new guy but they weren\u2019t dating. Of course her bf knew(or ex) he was devastated but he was also stupid and was trying to get her back even tho she was a shitty gf. Eventually she caved in and they got back together and she left the new guy. After that about a week or two because the new guy\u2019s class was next to mine I knew of him and he knows me. It was his birthday so I texted him happy birthday(out of good manners). He replied Thank you and I left it at that. But he kept texting me asking me stuff to keep our conversation going and I thought it was odd I haven\u2019t told my friend this because I didn\u2019t think it meant anything and when the conversation finally ends I thought he probably never text me again. But the next day he texted me again. I didn\u2019t confront my friend about this I didn\u2019t know if I should since the text wasn\u2019t flirty so I thought I could just be dramatic. I went to another friend she was in the same group as me and the first girl and I told her about it asking her if I should tell her. My other friend(I\u2019ll call her M) M told me that I shouldn\u2019t because there was no sign of flirting so it should be fine and told me to wait until it is more obvious. So I waited and I started develop feelings for him as well. We started seeing each other and it made me feel so bad that I didn\u2019t tell my friend and after a week i decided to tell her. I went to M for advice so many times she always comeback with \u201cjust don\u2019t tell her\u201d but I didn\u2019t think that was right. So when I finally came out to my friend she was angry at me and said I stole her ex from her(they never dated) and she told me she wasn\u2019t going to talk to with me. The day after I told her she act as if I don\u2019t exist and not just her but M as well. Even though M always told me how she understands me but now she\u2019s acting like she was disgusted by me. I felt so guilty and shameful I couldn\u2019t bare to talk to the guy anymore and I told him that couldn\u2019t do this anymore a day before he was going to ask me to be his gf. I tried to talk to her but she gave me a cold shoulder even when I wrote a letter to her she just shoved it away. I\u2019ve spent 7-8 months with no friends the only person who was supportive of me was her boyfriend but he couldn\u2019t do much convincing as well since she was stubborn and is his gf. When we finally got back after almost a year I thought everything was going to go back to normal but it didn\u2019t. Even when I\u2019m with them I feel alone. They completely neglected me always hanging out together not inviting me, I always walk behind and the last to know about anything. I feel like I always had to be the one chasing them even before we had fought I felt like I was left out it just wasn\u2019t as bad. \n\nNow that we all graduated they\u2019re still friends and go out together when they can without me. It really hurts me because I loved them but I guess they never loved me to begin with so i decided to cut them off and unfollow them on one of the girls birthday. Life has been more peaceful ever since that.",

Don\u2019t let this get to you, you shouldn\u2019t be ashamed for this.",

    "postText": "I'm 20f,but I don't know how to masturbate....,I'm a virgin and it's not like I'm super desperate to get laid,but everywhere,books,novels, internet- this sex and masturbation feels great and all has me curious and apparently it can relieve stress or something....but I feel like a pervert for thinking about it so much.\n\nI tried looking stuff up,but the medical tutorials became confusing after a while,and porn felt exaggerated and annoying.Adult Toys are not a thing where I live. \nI don't have many friends, definitely not anyone close enough to admit this and ask for help cuz I don't wanna be seen as a pervert and creep.\n\nI don't wanna have sex before marriage,yeah, I'm kinda on the conservative side,but also,I don't wanna get used and then thrown away.He can't bail out after using me and potentially getting me pregnant if we're married.Like he can't say nonsense like I'm bad in bed as an excuse for divorce.",

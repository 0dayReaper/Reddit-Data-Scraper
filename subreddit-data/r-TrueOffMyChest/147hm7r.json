    "postText": "I hate being happy, I hate having good things come to me whether deserved or not. That\u2019s why I love being mentally fucked up, I never want help, I don\u2019t want help. I want to be a red flag that everyone avoids, I love doing drugs to make myself feel worst once the effects wear off. I want people to look at me and say \u201cWow what a waste he\u2019d be better of killing himself.\u201d I love self-harming, I love closing myself off from everyone and leave me to my own mind. It\u2019s fun, so much fun, the only reason why I wake up everyday is to hate on my worst enemy, me.",

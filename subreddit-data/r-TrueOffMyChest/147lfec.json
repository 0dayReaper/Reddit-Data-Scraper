    "postText": "I know that what we consider evil is subjective, but I mean that from an objective scientificly informed point of view, if the Nazi-regime was slightly below the mean rates of violence among hunter-gatherers and 99% of human existance, you can't say that they were particularly evil and certainly not monstrous or insane - they were just normal people doing what normal people does, which apparently is kill people who are not in our \"tribe\".\r  \n\r  \nI think the reason people cling to the view that they were insane and monsters and that it's so unbelievable how humans can behave they way they did, is because they are in denial about the true nature of humans, and want to see genocide, wars, \"psychopathic behaviors\", as an aberration rather than what it means to just be a healthy, sane human being, following our natural instincts.\r  \n\r  \nSteven Pinker's book \"The Better Angels of Our Nature\" is considered as being very strong in its data and research.",

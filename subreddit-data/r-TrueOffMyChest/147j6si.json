    "postText": "Throwaway account because this is personal\n\nEnglish isn't my first language, so please bear with me as I try to pour my heart out in the best way I can. This is a throwaway account because I need a safe space to share my pain, and I hope you'll lend me your support and understanding.\n\nA few months ago, my world came crashing down when I discovered that my bf, whom I had helped overcome a severe case of depression, had cheated on me. It felt as though the ground beneath me had vanished, leaving me in a state of shock and confusion. You see, I had dedicated myself to supporting and caring for him during their darkest moments, and I believed we were building a future together.\n\nWe were on the cusp of getting married. The wedding preparations were in full swing, and our love felt unbreakable. Or so I thought. The revelation of their infidelity shattered my trust in an instant, leaving me to grapple with emotions I never thought I would experience. It was as if the universe had played a cruel joke on me, mocking the love and commitment I had invested in this relationship.\n\nBut that wasn't the end of my torment. As I struggled to come to terms with the betrayal, his family turned against me. Instead of acknowledging his actions and the pain they caused, they unleashed a barrage of abuse and blamed me for his infidelity. It was a gut-wrenching twist of fate, as I had believed we had developed a loving bond with his family.\n\nThey accused me of driving him into the arms of another, painting me as the villain in this narrative. Their words cut deep, piercing through the already fragile remnants of my heart. The very people I had hoped would offer solace and understanding instead added to my anguish.\n\nAs if that weren't enough, my stepmother also joined the chorus of blame. She couldn't resist the opportunity to condemn me, questioning my character and integrity. Her harsh words only intensified the pain I was already feeling. I had been betrayed by the person I loved, cast aside by his family, and now criticized by someone who should have shown me love and support.\n\nI sit here today, grappling with feelings of betrayal, abandonment, and overwhelming sadness. It feels as though my world has crumbled around me, and I'm left to pick up the shattered pieces on my own. The pain is suffocating, and I find myself questioning my self-worth and whether I deserve happiness.",

It can feel almost like a death in the family when someone you care about so much chooses to abandon the relationship then to have people that should have had your back turn and stab you in it instead. You can Breathe through it.  Literally just take deep breaths whenever you are feeling overwhelmed. And find a mantra to repeat to yourself..\u201d I deserve better \u201c, \u201cI\u2019ll survive\u201d, \u201cThis too shall pass\u201d etc.",

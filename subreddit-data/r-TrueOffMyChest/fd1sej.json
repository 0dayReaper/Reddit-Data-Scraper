    "postText": "I met my husband on April 1, 2011. When his birthday rolled around that November, I asked him what his favorite flavor of cake was so I could make it for him. \n\nYellow cake with chocolate frosting. \n\nI went all out. I made everything from scratch and decorated it as best I could. He loved it. I promised him I'd make him a yellow cake with chocolate frosting every year for his birthday, and I have. 8 yellow cakes with chocolate frosting. He's loved every one. \n\nFlash back to March 3, 2012. My birthday, the first one I got to spend with him. He made me a delicious dinner, and when it was finished he proudly brought out what he had made for dessert. \n\nYellow cake with chocolate frosting. \n\nHe was so proud of it. He had spent so much time on it and it was one of the sweetest things anyone has ever done for me. I finished my first slice, and he offered me another. So I ate that one, too. \n\nI hate yellow cake with chocolate frosting. \n\nHe's made me seven yellow cakes with chocolate frosting, one each year. It is our birthday tradition and I actually look forward to it in a weird way every year. \n\nToday is March 3. When I was helping him unpack from the last shopping trip I saw it all there: the sugar, the vanilla extract, the cacao powder. I asked him if he was baking something soon, and he just beamed at me. \n\nI love this man so much. I'll never tell him how I feel about yellow cake with chocolate frosting. They may even grow on me one of these years.\n\nEdit: Holy moly this has taken off! Two awards?! Thank you all so much! My husband disappeared to the kitchen about half an hour ago, and I hear the mixer going. Soon the house will be filled with the smell of yellow cake!\n\nEdit 2: My goodness y'all, this has really blown up! I'm trying my best to keep up with all your comments. I am so grateful for all the awards, silver, and gold. I am so happy that a little slice of our life could touch so many people, and I love reading the stories other couples' little \"secrets\". \n\nY'all are so wonderful. Thank you. \u2764",

Now my mother grew up on a dairy farm so we were strictly whole milk or 2% my entire life (not sure if they are correlated but my taste buds supported it). \n\nSince I spent summers at her family home during college when my wife and I moved in together we obviously stuck with skim milk. I love my wife and I loved her then so I just dealt with it. Fast forward 9 years later to when we had our first child and we brought whole milk back into the house for his benefit and my wife shared this gem with me one night: \u201cgod I\u2019ve missed whole milk\u201d\n\nNow I was shook - I obviously asked wtf multiple times and she conceded that she was drinking skim milk cause she thought I liked it. I was drinking skim milk cause I thought she liked it. Her family has only recent transitions to skim milk when I first met them, but I never expressed my interest in whole milk cause I didn\u2019t want to be difficult as the guest in there home. \n\nNow, we only drink whole milk like a couple of irresponsible adults who pay their own bills and stuff. Life is better now, though I still find it funny we never brought it up to one another.  \n\nPoint being - you guys are gonna laugh at the yellow cake and chocolate frosting thing either way.

Around the age of 20 I started to like it.  It was really good, but I decided to make a big deal about how bad it was.   I continued this every year, twice a year. She always begged me to try it, \" I changed up the recipe, I think you will like it.\"  Each year it was better, I loved it.  Yet, I still told her I just did not like cranberries.  Not my thing.\n\nRoll forward, I am 49, Mom 79, I decided to let her in on the long game I have been playing. I told her I absolutely loved her cranberry sauce, for near 30 years.  We had a good laugh, I told her I just thought it was funny our routine.   Now I will miss the game, but I get to eat all I want now instead of a couple of spoon fulls.",

This made the man grumpy as he felt that the ends were pieces to throw away but he suffered in silence. When his wife passed he was making a sandwich in the kitchen with his kids and they saw him start to throw away the ends of the bread. They asked him why, and he explained that he never did like them and now his wife wasn\u2019t around to be frugal about the bread anymore. His kids looked at him and said, dad, that was moms favorite part of the bread, she always gave them to you instead of keeping for herself.",

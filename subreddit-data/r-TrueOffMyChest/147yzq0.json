    "postText": "sorry if this is not the right place to post, i just need to tell someone about this, i will remove if needed\n\ni have never been to my boyfriends house before, except for the other day. he lives with his mum (he is 17, i am 16) and they are moving house soon, they are being kicked out by their landlord, he told me it is because the landlord wants the house back, then said the landlord told them that their bags and boxes are causing rats, although he said they only have clothes ect in them. \n\nwe were walking past his house to mine, and i needed to use the bathroom and i was on my period and asked if i could use his bathroom, as my house was an hour away and there was nowhere else to go. he told me i could as long as i kept my eyes closed the entire time as he was embarrassed because his house was full of boxed because of moving, and didn't want me to see. i agreed and managed to keep my eyes closed the entire time, except when i slipped while in the bathroom, and had to open them to regain balance. his bathroom was a mess. there was a large basket of used toilet paper in there, and a lot of rubbish, his bathroom door couldn't close because of it, the upstairs hallway was full of rubbish aswell. (he told me the door couldn't close because of boxes) i quickly closed my eyes again, did what i needed to do in there, and shouted him to come upstairs to help guide me back downstairs, as there was stuff on there aswell ( he said boxes again but now i believe it is probably more rubbish), we then went downstairs and to my house. his front door also won't open all the way (he again said boxes but again, now i don't think i should believe it)\n\ni haven't told him what i saw and i don't know if i should. i want to help and would happily help him clean the whole house if he wanted, i just have no idea what i should do, as i wasn't meant to see the inside of the house anyways.\n\ni just needed to tell someone about this. i hope when he moves house i can help so it doesn't get this bad, but i hate the thought of him living like this until then.\n\nthank you for reading",

                            "comment": "Most likely his mum is the hoarder and he's embarrassed about it.  Often the families and friends of hoarders aren't aware of the extent of the hoard and the conditions of the home.  Your boyfriend sounds like he's well aware that it's not \"normal\" to live like this but he probably feels powerless to do anything about it.  His mum probably knows that if he tells anyone about the conditions in the home the authorities will get involved and he'll likely be removed from her custody, so she's probably ensured he'll stay quiet.  I wouldn't be surprised if she also blames him for the hoard because he \"doesn't help with the housework,\" despite her getting upset if he attempts to throw away any of \"her\" things.  Mum probably visits the grandparents at their homes and doesn't allow anyone into hers in order to keep the hoard a secret.\n\nI wish I had an idea of how to broach the subject with him.  Unfortunately defensiveness and denial are part of the problem and no matter how you approach the subject he's likely to get upset and not want to talk about it.",

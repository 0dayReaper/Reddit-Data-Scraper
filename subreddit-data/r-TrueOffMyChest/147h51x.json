    "postText": "Its been a few days. First of all. Me and my boyfriend are fine. Luckily for us they didn't go any further than their text messages.\n\nMy mom filed a report against them. I don't know the current situation about that as I haven't filed the report myself. The reason I update you is a different one. First of all. One person in my SIL's family is actually going to testify in my favor and against her family. It really takes courage to do so. Its the same person that called me in the last update.\n\nSomehow they found out that she is into women. No reason to hide it anymore. However she said she's fine and is going to stay at a friends house. I have so much respect for what she does. Imagine the strength you need to testify against your own family. I now feel bad for assuming she only called me to safe her family from being reported.\n\nMore importantly. What is the current situation with my brother? Well my mom talked to him and told him to leave his wife or she will disinherit him from her will. He decided to stay with his wife and my mom made her threat come true. He's no longer in her will. My father did the same. When I visited them I also told them that I wish that this entire situation went different. They assured me its not my fault but I feel like if it wasn't for me then my family wouldn't be ripped apart like this.\n\nHaven't talked to my brother since then. My boyfriend feels similiar. He also told me he kinda feels responsible for all this chaos. I assured him its not his fault. But honestly I wasn't even sure if I could say this in my position. On the other hand it was my SIL's families bigotry that ruined everything and everything would've been fine if I could've just attended.\n\nBut now its time for me to grow distant to this situation. We see what the report will do. I followed your advice to document everything. The insulting and harrassing messages continued until two days ago. So I have much to say about them.\n\nUnfortunately homophobia is still very much normalized in our society. I already said it in a post in my profile but the reason I'm so calm and casual about the situation is the simple fact that I'm used to situations like this. They don't get to me anymore. If I let any insult get to me I wouldn't make it for a long time. Its a coping mechanism. I've been into situations where I was sent into hospital because I kissed my boyfriend in public. So insults and harrassment like theirs is nothing I haven't seen before.\n\nI want to say thank you for all your support on my first two posts.",

Divorce is a major thing and I don\u2019t think your SIL should be held responsible for her parents actions. All this should have been resolved before the wedding had even happened rather than your mum trying to force your brother to divorce.",

    "postText": "As you read on the title, I live with my brother father and mother and I couldn't be more tired of it\n\nAs you guessed it yes, We do share a room and its so annoying, I can't have my own peace because he would freely walk in, I can't have privacy because i'll get banging on my door, And if I don't open the door he'll get my father involved to scream at me.\n\nIts truly annoying, We have to share room, Computer, Clothing, \u00a1Even underwear! I just want 5 fucking secons of privacy, Just being happy and not having anything to fuck around.\n\nThanks for reading! This was a vent but if you have any tips for this, Feel free to share them, Thanks for your time and have a nice evening, Keep ya'll safe",

I know it\u2019s not the privacy you want, but it might give you some distance. BTW-ick, you share underwear?  That\u2019s not right. Hang in there y\u2019all!",

Or any kid who could maybe use some English tutoring? You say clubs are too expensive, so let\u2019s get creative on what can give you privacy.\n\nI also recommend long walks. It\u2019s not as good as a safe place to hide and be alone, but it can at least give you space. (Although obviously don\u2019t do this if you don\u2019t feel safe.)\n\nAs soon as you can work, I\u2019d say get a job and start saving money. (DO NOT USE A BANK ACCOUNT YOUR PARENTS CAN CONTROL AND FORCE YOU TO SHARE YOUR EARNINGS WITH YOUR BROTHER.) You can escape in the next few years and find someplace better. For now, hang in there, and yell at us if it becomes too much \u2014 we got you.",

Warning on that: if your parents are shady, they may try to take your money if they\u2019re joint owners of the bank account. If you can invest in a safe, there are places, like some grocery stores, that will cash your checks for a fee. (Keep the safe secret and hidden if you do this. Do not use a combination someone could guess, and do not share it with anyone.)",

    "postText": "This happened a while ago but I still feel like an asshole.\n\nSo basically one of my close friends ( F18 ) confessed that she likes me ( F18 ) and that she wants to be more than just friends. I already kind of knew because she dropped hints every now and then but I was still caught off guard.\n\nI didn\u2019t know what to say or do because I\u2019m straight and I didn\u2019t see her as more than a close friend, so I just stared at her for like a minute then I apologized and told her that I\u2019m not into girls.\n\nShe gave me a fake smile and nodded her head, she didn\u2019t say anything at all then she turned around and left. I was standing there still trying to process what had happened.\n\nWe used to be so close but now she barely talks to me, and when we do bump into each other it\u2019s the most awkward moment ever. I just feel so bad and I wish none of this had happened.",

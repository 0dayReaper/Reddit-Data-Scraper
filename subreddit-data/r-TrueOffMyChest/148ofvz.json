    "postText": "Basically title, I work a student customer service-y job and I have to go to people\u2019s addresses to talk to them. One place I went to earlier was a clinic and I was speaking to the receptionist when she said that the doctor would be available to talk in a couple of minutes. I think I said something along the lines of \u201csure, I\u2019m in no rush for him\u201d, to which the receptionist corrected me and said HER.\n\nThe rest of the conversation was fine, I briefly apologized and re-phrased it, but damn I just feel so bad about it. I\u2019m a young lady who wants to get into a different field or work, but where there\u2019s also a strong gender bias and women aren\u2019t taken as seriously and I honestly just feel so guilty for contributing to it for her.",

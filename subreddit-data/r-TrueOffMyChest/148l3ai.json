    "postText": "I am broke. I am so so broke, I'm moving back home with my mom, I can't get to work, im in so much pain all of the time, and I don't know why, and I can't afford to do anything about it. There's is something actually wrong with me, and I believe it's been happening my whole life but just so happens to be worse right now. However, I need a job to get healthcare, I need a job to get money, and I need an able body to get a job. Worse part is, I'm so afraid of getting money, or asking my parents, and then I go to the doctors, and they don't take me seriously, and then I spend a lot of money on nothing. This has happened to me my whole childhood. I would get grounded for lying about medical problems when I wasnt lying. Many doctors would call me a hypochondriac, but this didn't change the pain, fatigue, and numbness my body feels. They wouldn't even do serious tests, they would press around on my body and then tell me I'm crazy. This happens to adults too so often, I see it all of the time, I saw it with my aunt, and my cousin. My aunt had something horribly wrong for years, but bc multiple doctors told her that all of her tests they tested her for were negative, my whole family turned against her, saying that she was attention seeking. She couldn't talk! She looked and sounded awful. They were able to dismiss her very visible, very obvious problems. I'm afraid I'm just going to get ridiculed if even step foot in a doctors office, and I don't know what to do.\n\nFor clarity: I'm 21, I live in Texas, currently unemployed, there's not a chance I could work a 40 hour week, and my mom also doesn't have insurance",

All you have to do is apply, speak with someone in the billing or accounting department about debt forgiveness (it might be called something else) and they can give you info on how to apply. Youll need things like any W2s, your taxes, if your on government aid, etc. but once you submit the application, they must pause your payments and look over your application to determine if you are eligible for forgiveness. This program is federal law and must be provided by all charity hospitals but there is no law saying how easy it must be to access or submit. It does take time but its well worth it if your in debt; I got my 11K loans lowered to 2K. It helped that hadnt made 11K in the past 12 months due to the medical condition they were treating me for.",

    "postText": "This is the first time I've ever done something like this but I saw a post from this community that gave me confidence in wanting to get some much needed stress out. \n\nI've been in a relationship with my girlfriend for over 2 year's now and have been living with her in an apartment. She's helped me with a lot in my life, hugely helping with the realization that my mother was extremely narcissistic and controlling which caused me to be kicked out of my original living situation thus started us to live together. \n\nThe main point of this though is that she is Polyamorous and I am monogamous. \n\nI've known she's been Poly since the first day we dated because she lmk, and things were of course rocky when it came to the relationship and figuring things out. Around the 1 year mark her mother passed and around that same time my mother gave me the boot after I stood my ground against her. I'm not comfortable talking about my \"attempt\" (hope that word is ok with putting 2 and 2 together) but that really hurt her around that period aswell. \nToday I found out that she's resented me for it and feels like she can't continue a relationship not only due to that but due to the fact that our sexualities don't align that things weren't going to work out. She's discussed in the past how my action caused her to feel, but never once did she open up on the level she did today and I guess it just really hurts. She has talked repeatedly about our future, about how she's excited to move together (that was the original plan recently), we've had arguments in the relationship that are small and big and have communicated about what was negative and what we could do to make her not feel this or make me not feel like that, essentially the comfort or solution method. We talked A LOT recently about everything and she is willing to figure things out and we also communicated about her feelings but that if I am not ok with her being Poly that we at the end of the day cannot be together. \n\nNow comes what I've been leading up to, sorry I needed to fill some lore in \ud83d\ude02\nI love this girl to pieces, and with what I know and have heard from her she loves me a lot aswell and wants things to work. So I looked up Polyamory and tried to learn about it a little bit so I could get a better understanding of what could feel comfortable or could work or if it just wasn't what I was into and I found out there's more than just Polyamarous itself. With everything I've seen it sounds like something I'd be willing to give a shot and so I sat down with her and discussed everything I looked up and asked her questions and she came off.... Very aggressive? She gets very overwhelmed easily which me being someone who's been in multiple abusive relationships, I don't want my partner to feel any kindve way negative but I have a habit of wanting to get to the bottom of why I caused her to feel that way and it only makes her more overwhelmed. But this time it just felt... Different if that makes sense? And after talking to her about a lot of it and all the different styles she mentioned to me she's into \"Kitchen Table\" Poly (sorry I'm still very new to a lot of these terms). So I decided to look it up and after reading it it makes me feel very suspicious about her true feelings. I'm going to be very open here and blunt with my wording, in the past she used to post nudes on Reddit and make sexual posts about her wanting or wishing her roomates would use her for free, or that she'd get walked in on and essentially fucked on the spot and whenever she talked about college she'd talk about how her living experience in the dorms was she hung out with the guys or would talk about how she was friends with all her ex's friends/roomates when she and him dormed at the time, but with everything she's talked about to me about her feelings of being Poly it doesn't feel like it lines up or at least she doesn't seem to come off as Kitchen Table Poly but is diehard about how she is. She describes it as having the freedom to do and choose as she wants to because nobody else can tell her how to live her life. But she also sees the boundaries and communication of Polyamory as an issue because they feel like rules or don't \"allow\" her to do something and I just feel like that's not at all what Poly is. From what I've googled and read it seems like communication and what the 2 or more people feel comfortable with matters a LOT but I can't tell if I'm crazy and overthinking this or that there truly is something else maybe more mentally for her? I just feel really confused honestly. Throughout the relationship I've noticed when she talks about rules and boundaries or authority figures/parental figures \"allowing\" her to do something she has a very \"I'm a independent women and nobody can tell me how to live my life\" attitude about it. She compares it to how men make women feel less by targetting them for things and saying they can't do this or that which again confuses me because to me I understand that example but... Isn't Polyamory, even KTP still hugely about communication and boundaries and working together for everyone to feel safe and comfortable with? Again it's why I'm so confused and feel like there's more to it all but I'm nervous to even bring that up due to coming off in a way she may not like or want to hear. \nIf you've read this far I am so sorry for how long it was LOL but um... Yea that's really it. Hope you are having a good day or night :)",

            "comment": "Honestly, and I don't say this lightly, run. Being in a polly   relationship requires a tremendous amount of communication and trust. I could be wrong, but it sounds more to be like she has a sexual kink more so than a true desire to be in a polly relationship. This sounds more like a cuckhold kink. \n\nShe sounds extraordinarily immature in regards to rules not allowing her to \" live her life\" the way she sees fit. There are boundaries and limitations to everything, but especially in relationships. It doesn't seem as though she's interested in a relationship, monogamous, polly or otherwise. She wants to do what she wants, when she wants whether or not your comfortable with it. \n\nI'm glad that she's helped you worth your mom, but you need to find a mental health professional who can help you heal from the trauma that living with a narcissistic parent inflicts. Please understand me when I say that you deserve and need a professional who can help you. It is never a smart idea to rely on a significant other or friend for that type of healing.\n\nI know you love her, but you've jumped from one toxic relationship to another.",

It's difficult because she tells me she means it that there's nothing more going on and that she feels as though she has a lot of love that she wants to be able to express and enjoy with more than one person and it sounds genuine to me. I know that people can lie but she's really smart and has a good head on her shoulder but sometimes with the communication issues we've had in the past she comes off very defensive and hurt, she takes a lot of things that aren't meant to be personal personally and it's an anger that feels different than who she is when it comes out and its why that confusion feels worse because sometimes she won't even realize she's coming off x way and then becomes overwhelmed and doesn't want to talk about it. It gets to the point where she raises her voice and screams like she's being attacked physically or tells me to be quiet or to shut up when I'm sitting far away from her when the discussion was just about how I felt or me wanting to understand what's wrong,or if I've caused her to feel some kindve way I like to be able to know what I did wrong and be able to understand so I don't cause her to feel that way again. It's why I felt confused as to why she responded negatively about something that she wants to find a solution for only to not like the solution and get upset. Sorry I rambled a little but again I understand wym and I have been seeing a Therapist recently for everything.",

If she\u2019s triggered by you wanting to ask questions or establish ground rules, that\u2019s a problem. If past trauma makes communication difficult for her then seeing a couple\u2019s therapist would be very helpful. And if you aren\u2019t comfortable with the things she wants to be able to do while you\u2019re dating, please know that that\u2019s totally okay. Sometimes our wants and needs just aren\u2019t compatible and it\u2019s okay to walk away.",

The main thing I only want to understand is that it doesn't line up I guess? And she's extremely huge about her feelings on Polyamory but I've also heard stories of people using that label as a means of hiding their true intentions and when you want a KTP lifestyle, with what I've seen and read, her views feel much farther than what it stands for. I guess I'm worried about wanting to commit to a Poly relationship with her because things come off more than just wanting to be romantic with others if that makes sense? I do appreciate your comment and understand what it is you are saying.",

But if you aren\u2019t comfortable with it, and if there are no rules (ie, do you have to be there/know about it? Does she need to use protection? Are only specific people allowed?) you shouldn\u2019t be comfortable with it, that\u2019s fine too.\n\nHonestly it sounds like she\u2019s gaslighting you and is becoming an abuser. Because she knows she can manipulate you.",

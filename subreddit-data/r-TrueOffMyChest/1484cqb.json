    "postText": "I just had my 27th birthday and like the title says I feel so sad. I don\u2019t really have a reason, I have an incredible partner who I love and he loves me deeply. I went to visit my friends who live 3 hours away for two days on my birthday, we hadn\u2019t seen eachother in about a year so I was excited to visit. They were great we had a nice time but it really felt like the death of my youth. We were now in stable situations with partners who love and respect us, we didn\u2019t go on some crazy wacky drunken adventure like we used to just chilled till we got sleepy lol\n\nIdk what I\u2019m missing but I am missing something",

I\u2019m turning 29 this year, so.. figured I\u2019d share what has helped. We ended up just drinking, playing video games, and visiting a casino once the last time we did it. Pretty low-key tbh",

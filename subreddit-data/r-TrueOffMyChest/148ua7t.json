    "postText": "Realistically this is my first post that I've ever submitted. It's been bothering me for a long time and I'd rather this just get some form of visibility than keep it bottled up.\n\nI didn't grow up in a great environment. I was a second generation immigrant whom had the privilege of being naturalized through birth. My mother divorced her abusive husband and I never knew my dad. I grew up with a lot of issues and that's kind of where I'll go with that.\n\nI moved to a more privileged area that had a lot more wealth, but I wanted to leave behind my trauma in that area. I met a girl, and was introduced to her friend group the freshman year of my high school. We got close really fast, so I became integrated in that friend group. We fell for each other as high school students do, and unfortunately one day we decided to have sex. After this, she had changed her demeanor towards me and I felt like she was an entirely different person. I confronted her and asked her to have some semblance of who I fell for, which she then ghosted me for a day. The next day she texted me, you know you raped me right? I thought nothing of it, and that it was going to be a haha funny joke. To my surprise, a month later a police officer had pulled me out of my chemistry class in front of everyone and forced me to prove that I had not raped her. I am still thankful to this day that I had the messages to prove that I didn't. It ruined my entire high school experience and a lot of my trust later.\n\nI lost my friend group because she was upset that I couldn't handle a version of her that she didn't show me before, but tried to ruin my life because of it. I don't really know the nature of these posts but I'd very much like to get this off my chest.\n\nfun fact: her parents came to my house later to lecture my mother on sex rules. that was a fun conversation.",

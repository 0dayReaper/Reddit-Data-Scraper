    "postText": "I met a guy here on Reddit a few days ago, he was like no man I had ever met, he saw the world in an entire different light and I was attracted to that immediately. However, my intentions with him weren\u2019t romantic, I was just looking for a friend and he seemed someone easy to talk to and to joke with. We had some calls and would spend a bit of time together. \n\nHe was the one who started showing interest in me, he wrote me some poems, he gave me a cute nickname and even said he wanted me to fall for him eventually. Me, blinded by my attraction to him, didn\u2019t see anything bad in all of that. \n\nHowever it all just cam crashing down. We had a fight this morning and he admitted to not having any feelings towards me at all. He said, and I quote: \u201cYou\u2019re nothing more than a pretty face, there\u2019s nothing else for me to fall in love with\u201d. That absolutely destroyed me. I asked him the reason why he was saying all those cute stuff and making me feel special in the first place if he had no intention of being with me. He sad he was \u201cjust kidding\u201d and didn\u2019t think I had feelings towards him. How was I supposed to know that? \n\nI am absolutely angry at myself for letting him affect me this way, for caring, for allowing him to trick me like that. I just feel used and not good enough. Silly me for believing he could\u2019ve been different.",

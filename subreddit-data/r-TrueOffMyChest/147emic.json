    "postText": "All my life he's done nothing but abuse drugs and be a completely worthless bastard. Lying, stealing, breaking everything a normal kid should've had. \n\nYet somehow, my mother always takes him back. And now I'm finding needles and shit, blood in the bathroom because he's to stupid to even hide his tracks. This is the man who she's being manipulated by? A moron who leaves needles on the couch? \n\nAnd he's making a fool out of me, my sibling told me it's his needles prescribed for a doctor. I use that sliver of truth to hide away the reality of the situation. \n\n\nUsing the bathroom for hours, leaving blood, going into his car late at night till 2 in the morning. My mom would just ignore me, she already blocks out 80% of anything i say. Hell i told it to their face remarrying is a bad idea. Yet they ignored me, she ignored me. All those awful years with him and she still falls for his shit. \n\nAnd the police? If somehow he just loves alone time in the bathroom, or can't sleep if he doesn't drive late at night, or he actually was prescribed those needles. And was stupid enough to leave them on the most obvious of places. My entire family would completely cut me off. \n\nI wish i wasn't so spineless, and just picked up those needles and showed them to the police. \nMy mom is another bag of worms too, worse in many ways but i don't want to get into that. Would make this too long.",

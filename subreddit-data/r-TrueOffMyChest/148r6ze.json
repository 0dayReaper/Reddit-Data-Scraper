    "postText": "Long long history of abuse and neglect that goes back to damn near infant stage.  Went no contact but she keeps trying to dig her claws into me and leaves voicemails etc. I finally picked up today. \n\nI had the time. Starts off with the same shit, guilt-tripping etc. I ask her very calmly if this is the conversation she wants to have. Twice. \n\nAfter telling her what I felt and hearing her lie about the abuse, I finally, after damn near 31 years of her shit, ripped her a new one. \n\nI didn't cry, or feel guilty after and that's how I know I'm healing. \n\nFuck child abusers.",

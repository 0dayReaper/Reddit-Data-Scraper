    "postText": "I\u2019m not sure why my other attempt to upload was taken down, but hopefully this time it works.\n\n9 days ago, my (F18) now ex gf (F18), broke up with me after moving out 10 days prior to that out of my mom and I\u2019s house back to her family.\n\nAfter she broke up with me, and tried to talk to me normally for a bit, she didn\u2019t speak to me for an entire day, then after that, I liked a message she sent, and she didn\u2019t spike up another conversation for 3 days. I broke the silence by sending her a picture of our dog, which spiked a bit of a conversation before it stopped. After that, the question of whether she even had feelings for me anymore came up, because in the past she would break up even though she had feelings, but I wanted to know if this was different. Early in the morning, I asked her that, and told her if she didn\u2019t want to tell me it was ok. She responded and told me she will tell me later as it was busy. I anxiously waited 12 hours for her to respond, and when she did, we were talking about a different subject about her day for a bit before I brought up the question again, to which she told me she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it. I then told her to be honest with me when she was ready and she got offended with how I worded something, but afterwards it ended off by me saying if she decides to tell me just to do it as soon as possible. \n\nIt hurts even more because on her best friends social media, I saw that my ex, her best friend, and our friend hanging out together, and I feel like none of this has phased her at all, and like she\u2019s finally happy when I tried so hard, and that I\u2019m the only one suffering. Now I\u2019m stuck with a dilemma, because if she ends up getting more room, she wants to take our dog, she initially left him with me because she didn\u2019t have the space but that could change in her parents house. I said a while back that she could take him if anything ever happened, but now that we are no longer together, I\u2019m worried if I\u2019d never see him again, but I know how much our dog loves her. It\u2019s a potential situation she would be able to take him but I\u2019m not sure. My life has been a mess and it feels like I\u2019m the only one suffering. I told my cousin about everything and she was sad for me, and helped me cheer up when we spent time together. Thank you for reading.",

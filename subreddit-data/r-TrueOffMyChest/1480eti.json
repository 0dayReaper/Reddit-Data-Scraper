She always flirts with me and whenever I complain about being single she always says \u201cI\u2019m single\u201d with a cute emoji today i was talking to her about with my exes how they didn\u2019t really post me, and she said I\u2019d post you. And I asked her if she was being serious or joking she hasn\u2019t answered yet but she hasn\u2019t been online. She\u2019s so Pretty!! She is mixed not that that\u2019s important because it isn\u2019t but her skin is such a pretty color and it compliments her hair really well!She has long thick curly hair! Her hair is black it\u2019s such a pretty color. beautiful eyes and a beautiful body! Even though some people might not like how she\u2019s chubby which I find stupid. She has a very cute button nose too! I think she is perfect the way she is I wouldn\u2019t change anything about her. Shes so cute and has such a bubbly personality! She is very scared of hurting people which I find to be adorable I would treat her so well I\u2019d give her so much love. I just hope I get the chance I\u2019ll update you guys when she answers :)\n\n\nUpdate: WELL I HAVE A GF NOW \ud83e\udd2d\nI wanna ask her to hang out soon we always hang out we could go see the new spider man movie because we both love Spider-Man :) I\u2019d love to take her on a date to the fair or somewhere I\u2019m just so happy ! she\u2019s so funny and she has always been there  to protect me and support me I couldn\u2019t ask for a better gf:)\n\nBtw if you have anything hateful to say about me or my gf please keep it to yourself and don\u2019t comment it idrc about whatever rude things you may say about me or my gf just keep it to urself :)",

I wasn't in a relationship with either of them, but years ago in college, I was madly infatuated with this guy and I also had an intense crush on his sister. Lol",

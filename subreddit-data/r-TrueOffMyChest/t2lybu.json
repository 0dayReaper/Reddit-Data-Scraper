We\u2019re going to drop some off later. \n\nAnd, yes! I stand by my post history the way I stand by my husband!\n\nUpdate. \n\nShe is at peace now. He\u2019s devastated but taking comfort that she isn\u2019t suffering anymore.",

Some people view emotions as weakness so they keep everything bottled up and it turns into anger/resentment instead. My theory is that that\u2019s part of the reason that men are more likely to commit acts of violence, they never have any kind of emotional release except when they\u2019re angry and that can lead to them punching walls or acting out in other ways. I\u2019ve also noticed that some people don\u2019t consider anger to be an emotion, so they feel more comfortable expressing anger than having an emotional conversation about something that\u2019s bothering them. That\u2019s just my opinion anyway, but I do feel that the world would be a more peaceful place if men were able to express their emotions freely without being judged.",

It absolutely is A reason, and one of the more common. \n\nBottom line, going decades without EVER expressing one of the core human emotions (crying or no crying) is not the sign of a well-adjusted person",

Because a lot of people think love between young people isn't as valid as love between older experienced adults. But that always bugged me because who are you to tell someone what love is and how to do it? I was absolutely in love at 18 and had she felt the way I did would have gladly spent my life with her. It didn't work out that way. We wanted different things and we were 18, with our whole lives ahead of us. We still loved each other. We're both married to other people now. I can't speak for her but I love my wife and would do anything to keep her safe. But its a totally different thing than it was back when I was young. \n\nLove is such a broad term. It isn't some specific emotion that can be defined in any one moment or experience. It has so many faces and is completely driven by each individuals unique human experience.",

Love for one person can evolve as well. So in 20 years the person you're about to marry may define love differently than they do now, but that love is still for the same person. Sorry I had a really hard time wording that the way I wanted. But I wouldn't worry now about that. Nobody knows what the future holds and stressing about it before it happens won't help. \n\nOne of my favorite quotes that I use when I'm anxiety kicks in \n\"Worrying about something before it happens only means you go through it twice\" or something along those lines.

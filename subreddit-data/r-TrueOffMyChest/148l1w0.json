    "postText": "I am sick of every time I visit a doctor I am continually ignored. Maybe I\u2019m not explaining myself clearly. Or maybe I back down when they start saying this is what it is. \n\nI\u2019ve had anxiety my whole life, but when I was about twelve there was this six-month period in my life where I was continually sick. Nauseated. Couldn\u2019t eat, couldn\u2019t do anything without feeling incredibly sick. I went for professional help after I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. \nGets put immediately on Zoloft. \nWhen it doesn\u2019t help I get told that the next step would be to do a colonoscopy. And what twelve years old wants that? So I just leave the doctor's office and I don\u2019t come back. \n\nBut here I am, many years later, and I\u2019m sick again. I visit the doctors this morning, and what do they give me? Antacid. \nWhen I express to doctors that my I go from feeling normal to intense hunger, and if I don\u2019t immediately eat I get so drowsy I fall asleep, what pings as stomach ulcers? \n\nI am sick of being told I am just anxious.  I feel like shit. I can\u2019t eat without feeling incredibly sick. There is something wrong. And she refused to do anything more until I try to antacid for two whole weeks. I can\u2019t go two whole weeks feeling this nauseated anymore.\n\nI\u2019m sick of not being listened to.",

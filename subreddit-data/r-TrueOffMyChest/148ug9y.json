    "postText": "I (20f) just left a three year relationship with my high school bf (20m) because I felt pretty unappreciated. I really had started feeling that way for a while. But I stuck it out to see if maybe it was me in a funk. I had tried to talk to him about it and it never really improved. And then it turned into resentment. I don\u2019t hate my ex. I still see him sometimes. We are in the same friend group. It\u2019s awkward but I have no animosity towards him. It\u2019s was just over for me.\nI still carry a lot of guilt for ending the relationship. He was still very much in love with me when I decided to end it. I had a hard time coming to terms with the fact that I was too young to trap myself in a relationship just because it would hurt him if I left. Whenever I think about it, I still get a rush of anxiety. I still feel like a horrible person. No one in my life has told me that I am a bad person for ending it. I am a people pleaser (working on it). But I do feel much better and more confident now that it\u2019s over and done with.\nI currently work at a big chain grocery store on one of many management teams. I am a bit newer than most of the people who I manage with, but I know I am highly valued there. One of my coworkers (20m) on my team has really caught my eye. I definitely don\u2019t want to be in a long term relationship with him. But we click so well. He and I work together easily. We make such good conversations. We can deal with each other\u2019s frustration. We joke so much. I don\u2019t laugh more with anyone else besides my girl best friends.\nI have a hard time distinguishing flirting and hints apart from jokes and being friendly. I interpret everything as just being friends! I don\u2019t have boundaries when it comes to my friends. I love making snarky comments. I love the raunchy shit (in a private setting). But lately people have been making comments that he likes me. I genuinely don\u2019t believe it. All my life I have been seen as the girl who is one of the guys (I do not want to be, it\u2019s a title I do not want to carry). I\u2019m not conventionally attractive. I am a bit too headstrong for most guys.\nBut their comments have placed some guilt on my big ole heart. I try my hardest to be a kind person. There is nothing I want to be besides kind. My ex is not a terrible person. I don\u2019t want to create drama and stir up feelings. I was hoping to get through this summer a happy single girl. But a part of me also wants to see what happens and roll with whatever happens.",

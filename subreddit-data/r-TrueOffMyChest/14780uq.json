It was getting to toxic for myself and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable with the idea anymore. It was time to stop being gross. It was becoming more of a habit and it looks like I luckily shut it down before it got worse. There a lot of interesting subs here. It feels so good to have it be deleted, it was just getting weird. Just figured I\u2019d share",

    "postText": "Burner, but the name is kinda related.\n\nMy ex, manipulated me for our entire relationship, to the point where I nearly off'd myself multiple times. When I finally left her I felt relieved, for the first week. After that, she started to basically haunt me. I can't stop thinking about her, at first it was horrible, I couldn't sleep. I couldn't bring myself to eat.\n\nBut now, I miss her. I miss her voice, her love. Why do I miss her. I don't know. She was the worst thing to happen to me but I want her back. I feel broken.\n\nEdit: Who the hell gave this an award?! It's a burner account, I'm probably not going to touch this account in like 3 days.",

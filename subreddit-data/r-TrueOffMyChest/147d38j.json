    "postText": "i feel like a really bad person for saying this and maybe i am a shitty person but i hate seeing my peers succeed because i feel like a failure. i\u2019m at the point where i literally start crying because of it. \n\ni\u2019m a 20F college student and i\u2019ve been in college for 3 years but im still technically a freshman (according to credits). school is hard for me but i have MS and it makes it 100x harder cause my brain is literally fucked up. i missed homecomings, prom, school trips etc in high school because of my MS (being hospitalized). It\u2019s so fucking embarrassing for me to be a freshman after 3 years because i fail classes due to things such as running out of time despite having plans put in place etc. I see my peers on social media and they\u2019re about to be juniors. some are starting nursing programs officially. living their lives etc and i hate it. showing off their grades. i hate it. i had to delete instagram because of it. i feel so behind. not to mention, i never been on a date, been to a party, etc. i feel pathetic. i want to be a doctor and i\u2019m about to give up on it because it\u2019s not like the path is going to be easy but i can\u2019t even finish 1 fucking year. i never ever coped with my diagnosis but truthfully, i want to just kms cause i\u2019m tired of dealing with it. i\u2019m not going to kms but it\u2019s really lonely dealing with it. i just wish people were feeling as shitty as i do. yes, ik everyone goes at their own pace but it\u2019s hard for me to actually hear that. i just feel so fucking pathetic. \n\nit hurts more because my childhood friend is in a nursing program now. we aren\u2019t really friends anymore but my parents used to compare me to her. she\u2019s the smarter one and the prettier one. she always got awards, praise and always did good. so when i saw she got into the program, i felt bad. i am happy for her bc she deserves the best but it hurts a lot bc it feels like i\u2019m going nowhere. i\u2019m crying while writing this lmao. im seeing people doing so good and i\u2019m here trying to get enough credits to transfer to a full university. it\u2019s so fucking stupid ik.",

            "comment": "This is normal. It is natural, a raw primal feeling. I am 50, some very good friends were promoted above me when I thought they didn\u2019t deserve it. Not saying I did but when you work closely with people you know them. Be happy for them, keep the other emotions from them. Find a healthy outlet, mine was exercising. They are your friends, be happy for them. Your day will come. It is easier to type on Reddit than do, but understand most people have felt what you are feeling now!!!! Good luck\n\nAdding an edit. Ask them for advice of you feel need to help graduate. Tell them you are proud of their success, admit a little jealous and want their input",

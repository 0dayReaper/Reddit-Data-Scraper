I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find other subs with punny/dad jokes. \n\nCan any Mods from there can maybe explain why it\u2019s turned private, or perhaps approved members? I\u2019d also like to know how I can unsubscribe to something I am restricted from even finding. \n\nI\u2019ll be removing any of the ones I submitted if I\u2019m an outcast. That\u2019s cool, I was just thrown for a loop and disappointed. \n\nI know, this is melodramatic, this sub is appropriate to just express myself because I\u2019m bummed. \n\nCan anyone share other great punny/ dad joke communities? \n\nHave a great day folks.",

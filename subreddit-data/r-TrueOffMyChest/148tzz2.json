    "postText": "Just for context: Most of the people in my family are educators who work with children and teenagers in schools. My mom (56F) is one of them and she helped notice several students with ADHD or who were on the autistic spectrum, so she knows how to recognize the signs and so do the others family members who are also educators.\n\nMy mother was afraid when I decided to seek therapy to find out if I had ADHD, so I didn't even tell her about the possibility of autism. She went to a doctor with me once and he said I couldn't have ADHD because I never flunked out of school (it almost happened, but I never actually failed) and since then, she's decided it's impossible for me to have ADHD or any neurodivergence.\n\nI think it's also important to point out that in my father's family, some people have autism, but a part of the family is ableist. The most recent example is one of my cousins. He freaked out when he found out his son is autistic, didn't accept it and tried to prevent the boy from going to therapy.\n\nNow, here's the my story: I (20F) started therapy some time ago and I'll start getting tested to see if I have ADHD and/or autism soon. The problem is that this has unfortunately made me realize something about my family: either they are in denial about the (great) possibility of me being neurodivergent or they have never really paid attention to me.\n\nI have (and always have) problems with different textures, whether it's in an outfit I wear, a food I eat, or the floor I tread. Depending on the texture, I feel extreme agony. I also hate to be touched most of the time, by most people, but I like to hug my parents and some friends. I have problems with noises and too many sounds at the same time leave me disoriented. Sometimes I can understand sarcasm, but sometimes I can't.\n\nI also have trouble dealing with strong emotions and usually, I have some obsession that makes me learn everything about a subject (at the moment, it's a series of books, but I've had about other subjects). I have trouble communicating and could hardly talk when I was a kid and when I did it was usually about some \"obsession\". After some time, I learned to talk better using things I saw others do. I have a hard time looking into someone's eyes during a conversation.\n\nI'm terrible at dealing with changes in my routine. I have a hard time paying attention because anything distracts me. For example, I remember being in class, trying my best to pay full attention on the class and I saw a bird flying through the window glass and when I realized, the class was over and I was thinking about the species of birds in my country. Situations like this recur outside of class and it stresses my mom out. She often yells at me when I forget something or miss some detail.\n\nThe point is that I have these behaviors since I was a kid. I want to believe that they never noticed, but honestly? It seems a bit impossible that no one noticed it, especially when some people were trained for it. So, I believe some people noticed but choose to stay silent and it hurts me, because my whole life could be different if I knew about this possibility earlier. I love them, I love my parents, but sometimes I feel a bit resentful and betrayed because of everything, but I also feel like a monster to feel this way. Am I wrong here?\n\nEdit: the reason I think they now is that sometimes, some family members used to hug me when I was with my back turned to them or just grab me by surprise or after I say I didn't wanted to be touched and when I didn't like, they would say I \"looked like I was autistic\" (their words were exactly these) and laughed. Some of them also mocked my obsessions (which might be hiper focus) and sometimes saying the exactly shame things they've said when I said I didn't liked to be touched.",

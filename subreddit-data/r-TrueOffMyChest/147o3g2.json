    "postText": "My mental health has been on the rocks lately. A depressive episode has been swimming around the edges and I just feel so lost and confused in life. In drifting closer to 30 without having done much with my life and am in a relationship of 1.5 years that has great days and days where I don\u2019t know where my partner stands. The whip-lash of it all doesn\u2019t help my anxiety and when I\u2019ve talked about it it feels stagnate. I wanna go back to school but money is tight. I wanna new job but i feel like I have no skills. (I have been looking and applying here and there) \n\nI envision this whole life for myself and I\u2019m too scared to go any get it. Scared that if my relationship ends I\u2019ll never find someone else. Scared of being alone on all aspects. I\u2019m such an introvert that craves an extrovert personality but my social batter gets drained so fast. I feel like no one really likes me or whenever I talk to people they don\u2019t give a damn what I\u2019m saying.",

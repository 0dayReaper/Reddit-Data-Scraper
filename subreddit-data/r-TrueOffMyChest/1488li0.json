    "postText": "\nI was raised Christian and as I\u2019ve gotten older idk if i believe it. When I was super religious I remember thinking \u201cnot everything in Christianity makes sense but every belief has things that don\u2019t make sense\u201d\n\nI found a video a few weeks ago on a really cool concept. Essentially it was the belief that when we pass we float out of our bodies and a spirit guides us into the sky (it could be a family member that passed before us or a random spirit). They then give you the option to roam earth for as long as you\u2019d like, or to go to the spirit realm. Once you get to the spirit realm you can either chill with all the spirits there, or you can go back to earth reincarnated as a new human, and you forget all of your past lives until you pass again and turn back into a spirit\n\nI love this idea because death and even heaven always scared me, but this makes me feel at ease, but idk if I believe it. For once if I knew this is how life worked I wouldn\u2019t fear death, I\u2019d just be sad that I\u2019d lose my family and friends, but that means I\u2019d meet them again later. Each spirit has its own characteristics so when you get reincarnated the new human you is similar to the last one. You\u2019re personality is practically the same as the last one because your spirit is the same. But your looks, disorders, etc change. But your interests, sexuality, and what makes you, you, stays the same\n\nI honestly wanna believe this because it makes me feel ok with life and doesn\u2019t add so much pressure to this one life. Heaven scares me but this doesn\u2019t. Can I believe it if I don\u2019t feel like I fully believe it? I hope this makes sense",

I don\u2019t have the experience that my former Christian friends have had, but I can tell you from my observations that religious indoctrination seems to dwindle over the years the farther you step away and allow rational life experiences to form your own beliefs and what makes sense to you. Try not to worry and keep an open mind. There\u2019s so many ways to interpret the meaning of life, and Christianity just happened to be the thing you were raised inside of. Be bold. We are all in the same journey. Take comfort knowing that.",

Meaning all of your past memories aren\u2019t there.

Like if 2 people started humanity how did we get billions of souls? I\u2019ve always believed in God so I feel like that\u2019s where a God would make sense, but Idk.

Well then you could never be a Christian (not saying NEVER you could always be a Christian but I\u2019m saying if you never change) therefore forcing yourself would be a waste of time. It\u2019s like saying \u201cyeah I find you boring, I don\u2019t believe in your word, but I\u2019m gonna keep pretending!\u201d Like in our religion you can\u2019t get to heaven that way so it\u2019s like forcing yourself to live an awful life to STILL not make it to heaven. If you ever have trouble with your family you should explain it like this, sure it might upset them but at the same time any Christian knows that god knows your heart and if your heart isn\u2019t in it then there is no point in forcing yourself \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f hope you find what\u2019s right for you though and even though you\u2019re not Christian I\u2019ll pray for you and have a wonderful day/night \u2665\ufe0f",

That one left me unable to believe in a God that would send people to hell ever again. \n\nI know how hard it is to leave religion, especially when you\u2019ve been in it your whole life and your friends and family are in it too. But remember that you and only you get to decide what you believe. And you don\u2019t even have to decide!

You may turn out believing in a comfortable illusion, perhaps trying hard to convince yourself it's actually true. Is that really what you want? I mean, a lot of people do that, but it does seem problematic to deceive yourself about reality. \n\nI don't think this is an issue of religiosity. There are plenty of atheists who value truth over comfort. In Christianity, there's the idea that the truth will set you free. Therefore, you don't have to be scared of the truth. Now, if there's no God, it's harder to justify that. But if you still have faith that there's good in this world, then perhaps the search for truth doesn't need to scare you that much.",

They often spend their lives in fear of their gods and their punishment for misbehaving. \nAlso afterlife seams to me as extremely naive belief. People are afraid of death, of their own mortality and being insignificant so they create believe in afterlife to shield themselves from harh reality. Nothing wrong with that of course. If harm none, do what thou wilt.\nI guess it all comes down to what you are searching for. If you are looking for peace than religion may offer it.

To feel like a \u2018hero\u2019 I\u2019m guessing. \nEvery time, it was the same thing, some mixture of tomatoes, souplike water, pasta and some other vegetables. He loves this and I still can\u2019t understand why. It was bland and tasteless. The first times, I told him I didn\u2019t like it. Yet, he never brought anything else. After a while I tried telling him not to bring food, again, didn\u2019t seem to hear me. This continued during my third and final year. It was the same for my little brother. We both hated it. \n\nHe never changed anything. It was never about me, it was all about him feeling like a big boss, some kind of giving and charitable god who took care of his children. As if he didn\u2019t neglect us emotionally, financially and physically (the last was by his new family while he stood by and let it happen) since we were 7. \n\nHe really drove the nail home every time he arrived with this meal that our wants were absolutely irrelevant to him. So everyone saying be thankful you got any food at all, you are so wrong. Listening is how you show someone you care. Doing something for someone to make yourself feel better is the same as doing nothing. And doing nothing is at least neutral. But being surprised he does something nice and then being let down and realizing that what you want isn\u2019t important on your celebration is even worse.",

I cleaned I made her coffee before she even got in the door. \n\nShe thrust a beautiful electric guitar into my hands and asked me if I could do her a favour a tune it. Eagerly, I said yes. I told her that I\u2019ll bring her coffee over and then I\u2019ll get to work on it. \n\nShe didn\u2019t touch the coffee, waited for me to tune the guitar and then said that this guitar was for my brother. It was a birthday gift as it was his \u201cbirthday weekend\u201d and she\u2019d hired a boat for the weekend.

And I asked if she was staying longer as I hadn\u2019t seen her in such a long time. She said she had to leave without even asking about how my life was going.\n\nI then didn\u2019t see her for another two years.\n\nIt still hurts that I\u2019ve made a name for myself locally and I still can\u2019t get my mothers pride.

I was just depressed, hurt and angry from living with abuse from my mother and her husband for so long. \n\nI managed to get my shit together at 19, after being homeless off and on since 16.

IF you want to try to improve your relationship with your dad - you could bring this up.  But go into that conversation with the attitude \"how can we learn about each other better\".  I doubt you know his favorite food either (not that such should be a requirement of a child - to a parent... But the same concept applies \"do you want to know this human better?\").\nJust try to see how you can take any bad situation - and make it a positive learning moment, when possible.",

He'd likely be upset he made the mistake, and even more upset you internalized it that way. \n\nYour parents are people too, you know, and not perfect. It's one of the harder lessons of growing up as a person is to fully realize that the people that birthed you and raised you are just as flawed as anyone else and just trying to do their best.

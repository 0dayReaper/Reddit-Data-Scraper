    "postText": "(I'm sorry if this seems like a pity party considering what's going on in the world)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPeople wished me a happy birthday (the standard \"happy birthday text/Facebook wall post, and I'm grateful for that) but no one came to hang with me to just eat (multiple people were invited). I don't expect gifts, I'm too old to throw a fit but it's difficult not to feel the goddamn void of people when I'm just eating alone in my apartment, especially after two days ago we just celebrated another friend's birthday, with a surprise birthday party(we're all vaccinated), gifts and drinking. Its been like this for 3 years now. \n\nMaybe I'm that friend that people just tolerate but don't really like. \n\nThe pizza and crepes are good though. I'm grateful for that. \n\nNext year I'm just gonna travel by myself to another country.\n\nEdit: signed back on to having the post blow up. \nI\u2019m sad that so many of you know exactly how it feels and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had this happen. Next year let\u2019s all have a better birthday! Thank you all for the birthday wishes.\n\nEdit 2: \nI can\u2019t respond to everyone so thank you for all the wishes and empathy and advice. I felt very alone today and you\u2019ve all made me feel better. I appreciate you and wish all of you better birthdays",

I know people who can't have a drop to drink or else they'll spiral completely out of control into the perils of alcoholism and/or addiction.

Everything revolves around drinking. I used to be that person who would go to the bars with \"friends\" and drink. Go to their house or they'd come to mine and drink. Once I realized I had a drinking problem (became physically dependent on it) and I finally stopped drinking, my \"friends\" vanished. We have nothing in common now. These are people I grew up with. From elementary school through high school. That's how small the town is.\n\nAll I do now is work and come home. See everyone out and about drinking on Facebook. At first, I'd still go out and go to the bars when I was sober. I finally realized that just sitting there drinking Pepsi and watching them drink beer and act stupid was something I no longer wanted to do, I stopped.\n\nEven the type of work I do is the type where it's kind of acceptable to talk about getting fucked up as soon as you get off. I don't even smoke weed so that's out of the picture too.",

When it's not driving up to see them every month and instead inviting them to come over.\n\nSome people are friends of convenience, and it sucks realizing that when you thought you were real friends.\n\nBut once you start seeing who reaches out back, who puts back into the relationship what you put in? It's nice being able to tell who you're friends really are so you can invest time and energy into the right relationships.",

Sometimes I look at my group of friends and wonder why it's the ones who complain the most, cause the most disturbance, the most hassle etc. Why is it those ones who get the most love on their birthdays? Tons of cards, surprise gifts, surprise parties etc? It doesn't make sense to me.\n\nBut this is life. For many years now I've gone traveling alone. One time I went snowboarding to a resort for 2 weeks by myself. I tried my best to enjoy myself, but deep down I felt it hard being all by myself. I just didn't have anyone to go with. \n\nI had my birthday recently and I couldnt but help compare with other people who get loads of wishes on their FB page. I think I got maybe 4 or 5 wishes. In the end, I've come to understand that it doesn't really matter what others think of you... compared to what you think of yourself. Your self-worth should always come from within, not some external validation. If you feel you're a good person, nice to others, helpful etc. Then you can be happy with yourself. Things might not seem ideal - you may see bad peeps living it up, but another thing I've learned is that what's on the surface isn't always reality. People may seem to have the perfect life, but we all have problems. Just be content with yourself, and whatever will happen, will happen.\n\nI've come to see things that way about myself. I'll never be the most popular, most good-looking etc. There'll be a lot that I want that I'll probably never get, but I'm happy with myself. That's the most important thing. Just make sure you're comfortable with who you are, and that's what mainly matters. And let things play out however they will...",

So we got him balloons and she got him all his favorite drinks and food and cake and she spent like $200 on gifts for him and she spent the whole night with him and had a great time. Well my birthday was the next month we were together for 3 years at that point and she got me a card and a hug and then left after 30 minutes to go to the casino with her friends. So I understand how ya feel when you put so much into a relationship or friendships and you don't get it in return. So with that being said every birthday since then since I've been on my own I give myself a list of things to do and well fuck it I do everything on that list lol. Buy myself my favorite food go watch a movie go camping just really REALLY enjoy myself ya know. So I just wanna say happy birthday bro and I'm sure your having a good day but next year you'll have a blast going on a trip!",

After that I decided it would be their day to choose where to go out to eat, to get their nails and hair done, to see a movie. Just me and the birthday one and her sister.\n\nI\u2019m hoping they\u2019ll continue this and be spared what you\u2019re dealing with.\n\nTaking a day or two for yourself seems like a good idea anyway.",

Have you ever talked to your friends about how you feel?  \n\n\nI ask because I know that in my very introverted group of friends, we've had issues in the past where someone was hurt or felt excluded and the other people in the group had no idea. Heck, I've been that person myself; I'd just gotten so good at hiding my hurt that everyone thought I was fine. \n\nOnly when I really opened up about how lonely and isolated I felt did people start doing things like popping me a message if they hadn't seen or talked to me in a while. Before that, they just assumed that I was fine and preferred to be alone and so didn't want to infringe on my wishes or disrespect their friend by intruding.",

I'm an introvert, too, and often actually try to avoid parties and larger gatherings,  so none of my friends would even think that I  would want a surprise party.

I'm not saying that these situations are the same as OP's, I'm just saying they happened to me and are also a possibility.",

People are complicated, and it's hard to judge OP's social group without knowing more about them. Maybe they all hate large gatherings and assumed OP would already have company. Maybe *they* don't feel like they're important enough and that you wouldn't care if they showed up or not. They might be burned out on large parties if you just had one two days ago. They might all be busy (today is a holiday here in the States). I have no idea and I can't pass judgement. \n\nSorry you had to spend your birthday alone today. That sucks. Happy Birthday though. Consider contacting your friends tomorrow. Not to berate them, but just to say \"I missed you\" to show you care about them still. Things like that can be very powerful.",

They're probably not going to be sitting around thinking, \"man, I wonder if OP is having a great birthday\". That's just not something most people do.

It's almost no wonder people are exhausted and stingy with their free time.\n\nNot to invalidate OPs feelings though.

It takes time. For now, as much as I can, I give ya all my support and hope that trip you plan for next year is what you need (because ya surely deserve it). And should your next birthday come around and you feel down, or hell, for any time between now and then, ya got a birthday neighbor here who's willing to give a good chat or give a listening ear. The same goes for anyone else here who's going through a tough time, birthday-related inquiries or not. I know that as someone who has been in this situation for many years, I would have liked for anyone to offer me some kinda conversation or at least some acknowledgement. A most sincere cheers to all of us introverts, and cheers to you on your birthday OP!",

            "comment": "I used to keep it to myself first. Just suffer alone, not tell anyone how I feel.\n\nBut then I realised that It's not my mistake that the other person is an asshole, it's a mistake to still keep him/her in my life. Also, these feelings of anger, frustrating, lonelyness and what not start to pile up and create a very toxic inner self.\n\nI realised that I can't live like this, I need to let it out and what better and appropriate than on the person who made you feel that way.\n\nI am not saying be angry or mean to them but acknowledge that they were wrong. In my case, I would have just politely tell them that I was expecting them, putting them in an awkward position. And if they don't have a good reason, that's a signal to part ways.\n\nNo one needs anyone less or more, everyone has just a role to play in each others life. And if your friends are making you feel shitty, is it really worth it to maintain the friendship?\n\nIf you don't let it out, your behaviour changes, and you become the weird guy, also, next year when they again have a birthday party for your friend, will you go? How will that make you feel? And if you don't, they'll not like you even more.\n\nWhat I have learned from my experience is that keeping the record straight and making them realise in a subtle way what they did wrong is the best path in this scenario........they either change or go the other way in which cass you'll have to let them go.\n\nOfcourse, you need to be confident about yourself and enjoy spending time by yourself to not be afraid of people leaving in your life.\n\nYou did not do anything wrong if they didn't reciprocate the same feeling, their behaviour is simply not in your control. BUT, if you tolerate that and be okay with it, that's when you bring down your self respect.\n\nTheir behaviour is not in your control but how you respond is in your control. Don't accept something if you feel you don't deserve it.\n\nHope this will be helpful, suggestions are welcomed.",

            "comment": "I've felt the same way every year since I was 14. No one bothers and officially this year I didn't even bother with invites (now 33).  I'm older and found the love of my life and as long as she is with me I don't care about invites. Not everyone is as fortunate but I've given up on others. \n\nLate last year I nearly died from a brain injury and I'm merely back by luck. I almost died and I had tons of people seeping through the cracks. The moment I am back , and obviously alive, they scatter. I have no one to play games with, to talk to, to hang out. Sure of course it's covid but gaming is online. Talking is touchless. I even see some of them partying. \n\nNo one wanted to bother before and no one definitely wants to bother with a disabled chick now. In all my years I've been to 2 birthday parties and at both I was a shadow. Just nothing.\n\nI confidently say that people do enjoy my company but for some reason not by schedule. I hardly even got invited to closer friends houses. I didn't even really get fat until college. \n\nI did a lot of stuff through school and was heavily involved in a lot. When I was dying I said love you and bye to my gf and when I woke I thought I was 52. I got to cally gf. Some random online guy friend sent me a stuffed animal and my boss too. No calls. No one there. Nothing on any of my social media.\n\nI, without doubt, can say when I die that my gf will be there and maybe some of my family. My emergency surgery was brain surgery. So for the first month I hallucinated endlessly. I don't recall even going into surgery. The last thing I saw was a ER ceiling.\n\nI say fuck people in general. They were all for woe is me stories while I lay in the hospital with tubes in my head. When I come out I can't even get a few good words. I used to drive these people to work, airports, and home. At all hours! I used to be a shoulder they cried on. I was a go to. Then one day I basically died they went boohoo and then I'm back and they can't be found. \n\nI'm not spending anymore time on the unwilling. I give anyone just one go before I say fuck it now.\n\nFor the most part it's a 1 in 100 chance to find someone willing to go the mile. I found my person, my gf. I only hope everyone like me fines their person. You don't need a line of folks you just need one.\n\nAlso in my time hallucinating I had other lives. One life I lived i actually died in. I died alone in an old folks home. I celebrated many of my birthdays alone. I stopped celebrating after my 6th time alone. Every other one was just another day alone. I had kids but they didn't remember and after 21 it wasn't really that glorious to me anyways.\n\nIt's rough. I wish you well and a belated birthday.",

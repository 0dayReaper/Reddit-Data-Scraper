He's from another town but visits me on weekends. I never met his family, friends or been to his town. I know that he works at the church and he takes pride in that.\n\n3 weeks ago, I found out that he's actually married and has 2 kids, I was devastated and in a state of disbeleif but most of all, I was mad, especially after I confirmed this via his wife's social media account. We're still talking and I haven't broke up with him yet...I planned and decided to show myself to his family on Sunday at his church and let them know that he used me and took advantage, I plan on ending it right there and then. I'm currently in his town staying at a hotel, I'm doing this tomorrow and no one knows except myself, He's still texting me lies thinking that I'm stupid or ignorant. I feel terrible but something's pushing me to do this. Don't know if it's anger or feeling bad for his wife and kids..I just...I'm not gonna lie I'm worried this might back fire at me but at this point I have nothing to lose, I just feel like I need to get my respect and dignity back after being lied to and fooled for 2 years.",

This happened to me too on a smaller scale (the OP, not the funeral thing, holy shit) \n\nI posted in r4r like a year ago, got talking with this guy, eventually exchanged numbers. He lived in another province, so we'd talk on the phone fairly often, text all day every day. I was thinking this guy was like the real fucking thing, marriage material, and I wasnt a woman who was ever interested in marriage. \n\nI think 4 or 5 months of this shit, he calls me one night and is like \"hey... im married\". OH OK SOUNDS GOOD. Found his wife that same night and was like hey Im extremely sorry to inform you your husband has been having an emotional affair with me for months, I have buckets of proof. She replied, she was sooooo fucking nice, she was like \" yeah he called you last night because I found out and made him call you\". So the POS didnt even do it to be a good person, he got caught. \n\nHow desperately fucked up, sad, and pathetic do you have to be to do that? Hi Dom I hope you read this youre a loser. In a word, worthless \ud83d\udc8b",

Saved all the evidence, made him give her access to his FB account and went nuts with it, and talked to his fiance and they both dumped his ass. She is not someone you want to fuck with. \nIt is still incredibly sad that she was treated this way. \n\nPreviously she was married for over 10 years had a kid and found out that guy had a double life with some other girl. I don't know many details about that but it was really really terrible.",

I'd say that a much, *much* better way to do this, would be to alert the wife in private *first*, before he has a chance to delete any of the evidence. Maybe arrange to meet for lunch or something, and have the wife in the parking lot laying in the cut, or somewhere else where she can't be seen. \n\nOf course, this could go pretty badly if she isn't receptive to you; but it might be a better shot than just showing up at his church and hoping to hell that he doesn't find a way to convince his wife/family that you're crazy before deleting all the evidence.",

The wife deserves to know, but not to have her laundry aired, since HIS is dirty and not hers. \n\nI would suggest trying to approach her, and asking him to take a walk w the kids and THEN see what he speaks of. He may rather walk away and deal w what he manifested, rather than let his children pay the price. But then again, a man that would DO thi, sadly isn\u2019t thinking about his family and their well being. \nGood luck OP. \nBeen through this, however I was the \u201cwife\u201d.

Call/text the wife while he's on his way or at the house, something that makes sure he can't talk his way out of it.\n\n\nTo be honest, there is no perfect way to break it to someone.

The odds he\u2019s going to make OP sound like some obsessed psycho who found him online and has started to stalk him is EXTREMELY HIGH. The church people are far more likely to believe this guy they know and respected for years vs this strange woman who showed up making accusations they may not want to believe. \n\nOP I strongly suggest just messaging the wife and show her screenshots of your convos going back years. Getting revenge likes his in person may sound tasty but\u2026 come on, he might be an asshole but the kids don\u2019t deserve this shit and the variables are too high for this go sideways on you.",

Even if it's not Christian, it'll be the same.  Man good, woman bad.\n\nAside from that, the OTHER woman they will turn on is the wife.  Why was her vagina so broken he felt the need to stray, why is she not good enough, and on and on and on.  He will suffer zero humiliation.   He will be pitied and given sympathy.   The wife will be frigid and you'll be a whore.  That's it.  \n\nGo meet with the wife.  Contact her somehow and tell her the deal.  She deserves to know.  Her next move isn't your business.

            "comment": "Wtf is wrong with some of you in this thread??\n\nOP. Assuming this is even real. Don\u2019t go to the church. Don\u2019t \u201cget revenge\u201d by sitting near his family \u201cmaking him sweat\u201d. This isn\u2019t some bullshit rom com. \n\nYou found his wife on social media. Contact her there. Give her proof so she can address this on her terms. This is going to ruin her life as it is, but doing it privately will let her talk to confidants and a lawyer, figure out what to tell her kids, and get her ducks in a row. You and she are both his victims. \n\nIf you do the big dramatic thing, you\u2019ll tip him off. He could go withdraw a bunch of money, or start gaslighting her about \u201cthis crazy stalker making up lies in his DMs\u201d, etc. Or he could kidnap his children, or threaten or hurt her, or any number of panicky things a creature like him could come up with when backed into a corner. \n\nIf this creep dated you for two years and kept you and his family in the dark, he is not a normal person. He at the very least has some social or emotional growth issues. Probably a destructive narcissist. He might be a sociopath. You clearly have no idea who he is so you don\u2019t know what he is capable of. \n\nCut off contract with the asshole. Tell his wife privately. Seek counseling to process all this. But this fantasy of going to the church tomorrow is a bad bad bad idea and will not accomplish anything you want it to.",

That was about a year ago and she's been a hot mess since, suicidal and in and out of the psych ward.  The new girlfriend gas lights her mother and turns her against her in a very sweet and loving guise.  And honestly her mental health issues could go deeper, considering we're in a pandemic and all of that, but that's when she really seemed to go downhill to me.",

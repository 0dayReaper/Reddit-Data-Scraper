    "postText": "Not sure if this is the right sub, but it's been bugging me all weekend!\n\nI went out the other night. Met a group of women with my friend who we just got talking too in a bar being social. They were older than me  and my friend who are in our late 20's. They were being a little bit flirty but we weren't into them at all. Very loud girls. Annoyingly so. Very overweight. Just not my type\n\nMe and my friend moved too a different bar and then them same girls were there shortly after us sitting a table away.\n\nI approached a gorgeous young girl and we kind of hit it off. Had a little kiss and I got her number as she had to go. Whilst I was talking to her the women from earlier kept shouting my name as if to try to wind me up or something\n\nI go to the bar and have a drink with some other friends I bumped into.\n\nI then go outside to the beer garden to see my main friend (from earlier) and he's chatting with the older women. \n\nThey are furious with me and are saying I grabbed some girls ass! they were saying 'She's 18 you F'ing pedo!!', really causing a scene lol\n\nThey point too a group of young girls sitting on a table a few feet away, one of whom is presumably who I touched, and they seem to confirm I did it! \n\nI'm not sure whether I have legitimately lost my marbles at this point!!! I wasn't able to confirm exactly which girl and when it happened before the bouncers came and threw me out! (they had no option really as the fat older girls were being super loud shouting that I was a sex pest etc)\n\nNot really sure where i'm going with this tbh lol. I'm not sure if i'm missing something! \n\nHow would you have handled it? I keep thinking back wishing i'd asked to watch the cctv, although tbh I don't think they'd have let me. Bouncers just tend to frogmarch you out and throw you out without letting you do/say much.\n\nAssuming i'm not actually insane and didn't do it, I wonder why they would lie?!  Or could I have a sex pest twin in that bar?! I've been going out twice per week drinking in these bars for a little over a decade and this hasn't happened to me before\n\nI can't stop thinking about it lol.",

                    "comment": "But as I said before, the reason i'm so baffled (and genuinely concerned that i've legit lost my mind!) is because the young girls sitting down seemed to confirm it! I really really wish I had the cctv footage!!\n\nIt wasn't easy to follow what was being said as everyone was shouting across each other, but i'm standing in between 2 tables. The older fat girls to my right suddenly attacking me for being a pedo, and then the table of the young girls to my left who seemed to be nodding and agreeing kind of thing? \n\nI'm sure this all reads like a complete mess and as if i'm surely guillty, but I have ZERO recollection of this, and even though i'd had a few beers, it's not as though I was completely paralytic (not even 'drunk', tbh) nor is it something i've ever been accused of in my whole life!\n\nIt's playing on my mind. I'm not even sure when I was supposed to have done this.\n\nMy order of events of the night was\n\n1/ meet the annoying fat women, but me and my friend are being friendly and social with them. They are being a bit flirty\n\n2/ We go too a different bar. I get stopped by a random super hot girl who kind of introduces herself to me. Whilst i'm talking to her the fat women keep calling my name. Me and  hot girl kiss and I get her number. She leaves\n\n3/ Me and my friend (friend A from earlier) hang around the outside of the dancefloor just chatting as it's not busy enough and the music sucks\n\n4/Friend A goes outside to vape (that's where the fat girls now are!). I'm still at the bar, this time chatting with 2 other friends of mine. We buy new drinks. I go out to the beer garden to see friend A again\n\n5/ Almost instantly as I go outside, they completely switch it up on me. Keep saying 'there he is! The pedo!! touching girls asses. She's 18!!!!!'. I'm like 'What?? Me??? What are you talking about??' - At this point the table to my left who is a table of young girls seem to nod and kind of point at each other! The more I try to defend myself the more mouthy they are all getting lol. Then the bouncers ask me to leave as it's all getting a bit heated now (ps - I kind of know the bouncer)\n\nMy friend 'A' didn't see me do anything either. for what it's worth\nI feel like i've been gaslighted in the most extreme way and i'm not sure why lol (i'm not even 100% certain of the meaning of gaslighting but I believe it to be being made to question your own version of events kind of thing?)\n\nAnd equally as worrying is the thought that i've literally got a hole in my brain and I AM guilty, but have no recollection of it!\n\nI feel like someone has said to me 'why did you beat up your dog?' and me saying 'what are you talking about?', and then someone else tapping me on the shoulder saying 'He's right. I saw it too', yet the hole time he was just sitting on my lap!\n\nthanks for the reply anyway!",

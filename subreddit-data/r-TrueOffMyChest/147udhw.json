    "postText": "All of my life I have struggled. One of my earliest memories was of my mom yelling at me because I couldn't remember the order of the months. School didn't come easy to me the way it did to my older sister. I often cried because I wasn't able to get it the way my peers did. Years later I was diagnosed with dyslexia and dysgraphia. \n\nI have what I now know as sensory issues. When I got upset it was like my skin crawled. I would scratch and pull on my skin. I didn't really fit in either despite desperately wanting to and large groups made me uncomfortable. It was ADHD that caused the neuro divergence.\n\n My first seizure I don't remember but I do remember the one after that. They seemed to be triggered my big emotions. For example once I was scared of a dog growling and the next thing I knew I was on the couch with an aching head. Turns out when I seized I hit my head on the coffee table. Thankfully the seizures were rare and sporadic that is until later in life. When I was 24, I was in school to become an officer, while working full time I began to feel weird. I was dizzy and felt like my head was buzzing. After many months of feeling this way I finally got diagnosed with epilepsy, dashing my dreams of helping to protect others. I'm now on medication and will be for the rest on my life. \n\nThe seizures damaged other parts of my brain and am now disabled. The weird thing is none of my family has any of the normally hereditary conditions. Although I didn't do great in school I can understand something went wrong when I was forming. The story of my birth was a running joke because I was story because I was stubborn from the start. When my mom was only 5 months along when I tried to make an early arrival. My mom was put on bed rest and given a medicine called terbutaline to keep me baking in the womb for a little longer. Ironically I came two weeks late, as if to say \"fine you don't want me when I want to come you'll wait for me.\" \n\nTerbutaline is normally to treat breathing issues and delay labor in pregnant women. The pharmaceutical company that produces terbutaline decided to hide the major side effect on fetuses. The side effects are autism, brain damage, cognitive impairments, learning disabilities, and motor dysfunctions. The company knew it was bad for pregnancy but because of greed they hid it! They permanently changed me, ruined my dreams, and knew that it would happen. How am I supposed to deal with this? I'm angry and feel so powerless.",

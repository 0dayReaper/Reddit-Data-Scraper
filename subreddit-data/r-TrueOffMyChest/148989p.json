    "postText": "I (22m) know that I don\u2019t want to live my life as a man. Currently, I\u2019m gay and experiment with pronouns outside of my home, though my parents and some other family members are aware of the pronouns I use (they/them) I tend to keep it quiet. My main reason for never entertaining the thought of transitioning is because I know the impact it will have on my family. My parents have accepted my sexuality, and even another family member who has transitioned, but for me it\u2019s entirely different. My life means nothing without my family. I make every decision with my family\u2019s well-being in mind and it doesn\u2019t make me unhappy to do so. The most important thing in my life is the relationships I maintain with my family members, specifically my parents. I know for a fact this is something that they would never comprehend for me, they could only ever see me as their son and sometimes I think they know what I\u2019m feeling inside because of the comments they make: \u201cOh you would never make a pretty girl you\u2019re so handsome!\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m glad I have you to take care of your sisters when I\u2019m gone.\u201d \n\nI never want to put my parents in a position that makes them unhappy. The amount of explaining they would have to do to the rest of my family, the ostracization from the people they\u2019ve known their whole lives as a result of supporting me\u2026. It would be their downfall. I think having one trans family member and me being gay is the most they could handle and the idea of springing more onto them destroys me. All of this is to say that I\u2019m not looking for advice, I\u2019ve accepted the fact that out of the two options I would lead a happier life without disrupting the relationships in my family. I know my entire life would be useless attempts to feel more validated in my identity. I would never feel woman enough, my body would always be too big, too rigid, too manly. This is something I will take to the grave and I am oddly not as upset about it as I thought I would be whenever I think about it. I just needed to get this off my chest.",

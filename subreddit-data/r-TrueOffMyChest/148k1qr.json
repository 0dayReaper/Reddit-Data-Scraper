    "postText": "I was really bitchy to a flatmate last night for no reason. She knocked on my door at 3am to ask for something (not personal hygien related or an emergency). I was pissed that she'd knock at that hour because I felt it's rude to do that so late and I didn't want to get up and I got more annoyed that she knocked more than once. However, my lights were on so she must have assumed I was awake and I was awake. I just hate being bothered and it wasn't her fault for not knowing that. \n\nI opened the door because I wasn't her to go away and I was really rude to her. I basically shut the door in her face and completely ignored her when she tried to talk to me about my attitude which was so uncalled for. I made her feel bad for not being able to read my mind. She doesn't even know me. \n\nToday I apologised to her and I could tell she was upset by it but she said it was okay. i told her I didn't realise she was speaking to me when I shut the door the first time (because I didn't I thought she was done talking when I told her I didn't have what she asked for but apparently she was still speaking, and I was super standoffish when I opened the door the second time.) I said it was wrong of me to speak to her that way and I was sorry and she said it was okay. She probably still feels some type of way about me and I don't blame her. \n\nI know that I was shitty but I realised I'd done something wrong and taken accountability for it, so now what I have to do is be aware of these behaviours so I don't repeat them in the future. There's no reason for me to be feeling this shame anymore because it doesn't help anyone. Except for some reason those feelings of shame seem to amplify by the minute. I don't want to leave my room anymore. I want to turn off my lights and disappear. Every time I think back on it I just feel like a bad person. Every few minutes I think back on it and think \"god you're such an asshole\". I know that doing something bad and labling myself in that way because of it is an overinflation of the  action and that it doesn't define me, but I don't know how to let this go and just move on and be better.",

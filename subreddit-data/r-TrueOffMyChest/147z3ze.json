    "postText": "I'm 34.  Once more time, I'm about to walk away from everything and restart. \n\nI have to be at a long term (6-12month) treatment center at 830 tomorrow morning.   I'll have had about 16 hours notice.  In those 16 hours, my life will be condensed into two backpacks and four garbage bags.  I gave my dog away today.\n\n\n\nLacking context, I'm not sure how that reads.  I don't mean for it to be morbid.  Or negative, for that matter.\n\nI've heard this cliche a lot in my life, but now I know I'm really fucking sick and tired of being sick and tired. \n\nIn 6mos-&gt;1year I'll be clean and working towards something worth having.\n\nThat is all.",

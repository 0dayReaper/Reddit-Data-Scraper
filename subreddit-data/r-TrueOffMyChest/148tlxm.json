    "postText": "To start, I am not alone in my life. I'm 19, and I do have a very strong relationship with my family. I live with my mother, my grandmother (mom's mom) and my father. My parents have been strongly together for eachother and for me for my entire life and my grandmother has been a constant and unconditional support. While I am so incredibly grateful for how strong my familial bond is, unfortunately I can't only rely on my parents and grandmother for the rest of my life. \n\nI've come to realize that I have never have nor do currently have, any real, consistent friends. I've gone through the vast majority of my life socially alone from people my own age. I suffered from extreme depression my junior year of highschool that caused me to fail that year and leave that school. Absolutely none of the people I called my friends noticed my absence. I was gone for months at a time and not a single person noticed or cared. I decided to move highschools at the behinning my senior year and every single person I had ever known from my first highschool never contacted me again. I never explained why I left or were I went because it was clear no one cared (and to this day, years later no one has ever asked). \n\nI then started a new at a different school and started completely alone. I became companions with a few people that I considered my friends, we went out and did stuff together like teenagers but as soon as we all graduated they completely cut me out. Dispite me tryibg my hardest to continue to reach out and engage with people, every single person I had ever met at my new school completely ghosted me. What hurts the most is the \"friend\" group that had essentially adopted me my senior year still all live in our hometown and get together every month or so. Just without me. \n\nIt's been a really huge struggle on my mental heath these past 4-5 years and I've never had friends that have stuck with me longer than 6 or so months. Not even my ex-boyfriend, who I wanted to marry, stuck around. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I have tried so so hard to keep connections, I always reach out. I'm always there to listen or to give advice if someone needs it. I offer to drive people places and take them out to eat or to fun places like tye movies or an arcade. Just so I can have what seems like a friendship. \n\nNo \"friend\" I've ever has has ever been there for me when I needed a shoulder to cry on or a quick ride somewhere or someone to go to a concert with (even if I'm paying). I don't understand why I'm not worth it? Why don't people want me in their lives? I try so hard to be a good person but if where to go missing I would have absolutely no friends who would be concerned for me or miss my presence. I don't know what to do.",

If it doesn't work out, oh well, but I figured I'd give it a shot, because I myself am also without many friends.",

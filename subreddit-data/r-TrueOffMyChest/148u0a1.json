    "postText": "I know it might sound bad, but I\u2019m seriously glad my grandfather is loosing is cognitive abilities. \nHear me out though! He\u2019s never been a grandfather to my siblings(22M, 20F, 17F), not in the traditional sense anyway. This fact is mainly due to his wife(71F). Let\u2019s just say; she makes us call her by her name, even though she entered my dads life at 17, when my grandmother passed away from cancer just 7 months earlier. His current wife had previously been friends and coworkers with my grandfather, he was quite the catch for a young single mother\u2026 even if he was married. So once my dads mother was finally gone, she had him all to herself! Except-for the children of said diseased person and her new boyfriend. So when my Grandfather got a job opportunity in Canada (we are from a Scandinavian country, so it was quite far away from the whole situation), she convinced him\u2026 or he could have gone willingly to run away from everything, from his shame and guilt. My dad, like me, is a middle child. One older sister and one younger brother with a bigger gap. his older sister-my aunt, was 20/21 at that point, she had received the inheritance from grandma and had ran away to travel the world to forget her sadness.  My dads younger brother-my uncle, was 8 or nine at the time, so they decided to take him with them and to bring the woman\u2019s child(7M at the time) from a previous man. And then, it\u2019s my dad\u2026 my dad being 17/18 at the time this was going on, he was having a hard time due to the loss of his mother, whom he was close with-was not baggage they wanted to bring to Canada. They never even offered, or asked my dad what he wanted to do. He was told three weeks before them leaving for Canada. Grandpa rushed to sell my dads childhood home, took his younger brother with him to north America, and left my dad, with the inheritance from his mom\u2019s passing. My dad, understandably ended up with the only party apartment at his HS. He started hanging with the wrong crowd and hit a wall, he dropped out due to it all. My dad had an aunt that stepped in at that point, she helped him sign up for the military and things started to get better for my dad in there, until when he wanted to find work within his branch and couldn\u2019t, due to not finishing school. My dad went to stay with his aunt for a while after, he tried getting his diploma once more. But unfortunately, he was beaten down by his teachers, they called him stupid, lazy, a shame. My dad got his diploma when he was 20\u2026 and by that time, grandfather was in his late 40\u2019s excepting a child with his now wife. My dad was never informed of the wedding, nor the child. Not until she was already here. By that time my dad had met my mom, and my mom was head over heels in love with him! He didn\u2019t know until the little girl was already here. His younger half sister was 21 years younger than her oldest brother. But she was not really aware of him until my cousins baptism 3 years later. At that point my youngest uncle(not bio) had his confirmation coming up the next day, that\u2019s where he found out that my Grandfather had adopted him. My dad never got so much as a \u201cheads-up\u201d, my mom was with him at the time, and easily just as shocked. It\u2019s important to mention arhat my oldest aunt and my dad were not close. She was not in the room due to her daughter being hungry, but when she came back in, my dad pulled her aside and asked if she knew. She was baffled, none of them had been informed. She left soon after and my dad and mom did too. Now my dad loves his siblings, ALL of them. He and mom would watch her often before my mom got pregnant with my older brother. Once he was born, they tried to mend the bridge by making GF\u2019s wife, the godmother of my brother. But on the day of the baptism, she told my mom that she was too young to be a grandma and to address her by her first name. My grandfather said nothing, this hurt, because how can a man that abandoned his kids, the kids forgave him and now\u2026 now he was letting a woman treat his grandchild as if he was unworthy of calling her that? kinda get the jist?\u2026 Now, she was become a grandmother to her sons children, my cousins are very cute. But seeing them fires up a rage within my mom. She vents to me often, and this time too. My uncle, when he came home from Canada at 16, was a mess. He became an addict, he struggled with school and jobs, paying Rent was difficult. My uncle went to GF for help, but got the cold shoulder from his new mom and his father. He came to my dad for help, and he did. I don\u2019t know all the details as to what happened in Canada, but I can guess. She has been nasty with us kids and adults alike. Now, my grandfather has been verified by me to be the early signs of Dementia; not being able to recognize me on the street, showing paranoia, and stalking off. weird behavior. After I was ignored yesterday, and after people stoped looking at me. I kinda scoffed and laughed to myself. The hag will become the caretaker to this man, and because of how active his life was with her, I hope he forgets her as a wife and remembers her as my grandmother, my dads mother. I want to get revenge, but my dad says no. I\u2019m sad for my dad. But I want to see the fall of her \u201cempire\u201d",

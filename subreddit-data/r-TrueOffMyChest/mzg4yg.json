    "postText": "I am a mother to a 17 year old, he graduates this year, college in the fall. He\u2019s been dating a girl for 2 years. I found condoms in his room. We\u2019re an \n American family. Sex at a young age is frowned upon. I\u2019ve always felt if you can\u2019t wait til marriage, at least wait til out of your teens (20) I took his condoms, took his card so he couldn\u2019t buy more, and took his car thinking that would stop them from having sex........\n\nHe will be a daddy in 8 months and I will be a grandmother at 42. \n\nLesson learned, although lesson learned too late. \n\nParents aren\u2019t perfect, especially those of us from such traditional backgrounds. But I realize now where I went wrong. I have a younger daughter and I now know to be better when she is around my son\u2019s age. Looking back, I do wish I would have just been glad he was practicing safe sex instead of trying to punish him because teenagers will find a way. He is nearly an adult, and I reacted as if he was 13. But parenting doesn\u2019t come with any instructions. It is hard to accept your babies grow up. \n\nSo I admit my mistake. \n\nWe live, and we learn.\n\nNote: Redemption and forgiveness should be encouraged when someone admits a wrong, not bashful shaming. Humans mess up. It\u2019s what makes us, human.",

Maybe I let on my excitement a bit much.  Because the night of the dinner, we're in the car driving to the restaurant and his whole demeanor just flipped.  \"Fuck this.  I can't stand Bob (random friend of friend also invited).  Did you see the way he looked at me back there at the house?  He was purposely disrespectful of me.  We're not going.\"\nThen he would put the job of calling our friends at the restaurant and making up some lie as to how we couldn't come to the dinner that they had so graciously put together and planned.\n\nI was so mad.  I cried.  Then he got mad at me for crying on the way home.  And then I had to go home and cook him dinner in my best clothes while he laid in bed stoned.  On our anniversary......\nUgh.",

The best thing I ever did was find a therapist who specializes in EMDR. It\u2019s incredibly transformative for trauma. \n\nThe mom-as-victim thing was the worst. I wanted to quit college because I was overwhelmed, had two jobs, lived at home and the stress from her was over-contributing (but of course I didn\u2019t realize it). \n\nI told my dad. He was so calm and supportive and understood, and my mother was out at the time when I had my little breakdown. He promised me he would protect me, we would tell her together. He would not let her get crazy. \n\nWell, she lost it. Hysterically crying, screaming at me for being a failure, *collapsing* into my father\u2019s arms, asking over and over when it was \u201cher turn\u201d to get what she wanted. She kept saying, \u201cWhat about *me*?!\u201d He immediately gave her all his attention; I was punished, she didn\u2019t speak to me for a week, woke me up at 6 am every morning and doubled my household chores, and of course, I had to stay in school. I was 21, with undiagnosed ADD, stomach issues, anxiety, over my head with work, and drowning in stress and emotional abuse. \n\nAlso want to add: this upbringing made me very distrustful of most adults, especially bosses and teachers. For the first time in my life, at 50, I have a job where I am happy.",

Her rebellion started when her mom would make her clean her room before she could come over to my house, or anyone's house for that matter, and then take back allowing her to go at all. Eventually she just started sneaking out. She was sleeping with a guy that was 25 when she was 16. Eventually, her mom kicked her out and she lived with me.\n\nMy mom, on the other hand, let me go places. She let me hang out with friends. She gave me money for the movies. Curfew during the week was 10, weekends and summer was 1 am. I rarely ever stayed out that late. It was available to me, but I didn't always take advantage of it. \n\nWhen my friend moved on, she didn't know how to handle the freedom we had. She was dating this guy who was older than her and influenced her into moving out because \"she was being treated different than (me)\" which wasn't true. We had the same freedoms, and we had even more freedoms if we were together. She didn't need to sneak out of the house anymore. The only thing my mom expected was getting homework done before going out. That was it. And it wasn't even a 100% expectation because she trusted us to have our shit together enough to focus on homework. \n\nAs soon as my friend moved out and moved in with the guy she was dating, she stopped going to school consistently because she missed the bus, got pregnant, and dropped out all together.",

It was better to just not question her. \n\nWhen I moved out, I somehow pulled sheer determination out of my ass and I made it possible that I didnt have to depend on her for anything. A.k.a. Barely talk to her or need to interact with her. \nShe can not fathom a world where she isnt the center of my sister and my attention. \n\nShe wants all information and she has no boundaries on how she gets it. She lied her way through getting a copy of my apartment key at my leasing office. This was unknown to me for about 11 months, so she would just come to my house while i was at work and look through my stuff. She somehow managed to log into my icloud account on her phone, and was getting copies of all my text and imessage information, she would request call logs from our cell phone provider so she could see if I was calling my ex boyfriend or my father. Now that im an adult and she knows I can take it she gives no fucks about slaps punches and ordtty much whatevers in arms reach to inflict harm with if I stay strong and dont give her what she wants. Trackers put in the trunk of and all over my car. \nShe would report my car stolen that we\u2019re both co owners of causing all kinds of question from police, or just coming outside to find my car towed. She manipulates my sister with diabolical tactics into telling her things about me.  That amongst many other things. \n\nIve gone no contact with my sister and im trying to with my mom. But the guilt is immense and its a process. Just going no contact with my sister and thinking of never getting to see my neice and nephew tears me apart. Sometimes the guilt is so mind bending and confusing I think it would be better to just love my mom with all her faults, but even amongst all the crap I have to sort out in my head, the one thing I know is that I cant. Go. Back. \n\nIm sorry that anyone is dealing with similar or worse problems. All I can say is im here to talk and that personal peace and happiness is above all else. A calm stable life is something to treasure and nobody should be sorry for seeking that out.\n\nEdit: im so sorry that its so long omg \ud83d\ude33",

I would think twice about keeping it over 3 years before replacing if you are larger.",

Support them thru the next few years by babysitting or even allowing them to stay with you while they get established for a better quality of life for their whole family.

He either needs a PsyD, or if he wants to do an alternative mental health degree like marriage and family therapy or clinical social work it would still take a minimum of five years. It\u2019s doable. My mom got her doctorate while breastfeeding. But he and his girlfriend will need a lot of support until then. I hope you\u2019re prepared to give it. I hope you love your grand baby and I especially hope you forgive yourself.\n\nI\u2019m glad you wrote this. It shows that you can learn. Hopefully you can keep that open mindedness in the struggles y\u2019all have ahead. His life will never be as easy as it could have been, but it can still be good. You still have an active role in that.",

It is 100% the mother\u2019s choice, there\u2019s no question about that, but I don\u2019t think it would be a terrible idea to offer to front the cost if it\u2019s something she\u2019s considering. A reminder that they are still young, that they will likely not last together at their age, and to think of what would be best for the child.\n\nI also think that you may owe your son an apology. But once again, it\u2019s very commendable that you take ownership for what you did. I think now is the time to show them that you\u2019re taking ownership for it, and not people on Reddit.",

When my sister was 15 she was dating a much older guy, and my parents ignored it. I didn't. Tried to provide her with condoms and explain how important barrier protection is when it comes to sex. My mom caught me and lost it, \"her baby, (my sister the GC), wouldn't do something like that! I was a whore and my sister was not! How dare I???\" I was incredulous. What interest does an older guy have in a girl her age, oh c'mon.\n\nMy sister was a mother at 16. My mom was a grandmother in her early 40s. My sister ended up dropping out of high school.  \n\nMy first and only child was planned and born when I was 25 and had a support system in place. \n\nRemoving birth control just leads to more babies, (and STDs), not less sex.",

Whatever plans he had for himself have just been wiped out by his mother's shortsighted and quite frankly thoughtless decision based entirely on bigoted, ultraconservative values. Now he has to raise a child. Will he be able to go to college while working to support a child? Can he enter a career he enjoys, or will he be saddled with a job he hates because he has a wife and child to support before the age of 20? Not to mention his girlfriend, her future and plans. And how will this child be raised by two emotionally immature young adults? You've just destroyed three lives for the sake of maintaining puritanical values.",

You can't change the past, but what you can do is make sure their futures are as bright as possible. \n\nSupport them, financially, emotionally and with your time. You don't blame them and make sure they know. If they need a place to stay, offer it to them. If they need a baby sitter or someone to watch your grandchild then be there. \n\nYes, you did something that has changed countless lives forever, but you also have a lot of power to be able to rectify it. Have an open conversation with your son and tell him how you feel.",

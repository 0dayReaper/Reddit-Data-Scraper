    "postText": " I (22F) think I may have cheated on my boyfriend (23M). My Boyfriend, Henry (not his real name) and I have been together for 4 years. I was 18 when we started and I really fell deep for him. He was sweet, loving, and although a little selfish, he made me feel loved and cared for. During quarantine he let me live in his house, and he's helped me a lot when moving on my own.\n\nBut we had problems, specially in bed. Henry has only been with 3 women in his life, and I was the 3rd. He's always been selfish, and yes, we talked about it a lot. He wouldn't go down on me, for some time he wouldn't use his hands either. He started doing it not long ago, but he hurts me every time and even when I explained how to do it, he kept doing it the old way, so I would just tell him not to do it. I would do everything so it was over as soon as possible. It also didn't help that he was just so insisting. I have 2 jobs + having to mantain a house. I am tired, I don't want to sleep with him because I don't enjoy it. For me sex with him became another chore, so I would put it aside as much as I could.\n\nAround 8 months ago, Henry proposed the idea of an open relationship. I accepted, since for me sex and love are not the same. I can enjoy sex without love, and so could he. He almost slept with 2 other girls, and I would occasionally kiss one (I'm bisexual) and he was fine with it. Until last Saturday night.\n\nWe went to a big party. All night, he was with his friends, and I made some new myself. At one point, I was drunk and horny, and I saw this one man. He approached me, we talked, we kissed, and then we had sex in the bathroom. He made me feel amazing. Right after kissing him, I met Henry alone. I told him about it and he said it was fine for him, even if we slept together. When I met the other guy again, that was when he had sex. \n\nRight as I left the bathroom, Henry took me aside and told me how bad he felt about it. He said that \"we agreed that if we didn't have sex in a while, I would go to him instead of someone else, and that we didn't have sex in two weeks, so I had to make it Henry instead of with someone else\". After that he left with my only ride home, and I was left there alone. I drank more as I asked some of my new friends about it, and they all told me that \"he agreed to it, so he has to deal with it.\"\n\nThe other guy took me home, I didn't know what else to do. He kissed my forehead and made me feel some type of intimacy I didn't feel for so long. I always have to iniciate hugs and (non sexual) kisses with Henry. I am the one who plays with his hair, who cuddles. Henry says that he's just \"not that type of person\" and I get it, but sometimes I wish he was.\n\nI slept with him, we didn't have sex, but we cuddled and he made me feel loved. He held my heand as he slept, he played with my hair and kissed me on the forehead and on the cheeks.\n\nThe next morning I told Henry because I felt that he had to know. He came after the other left and we talked. I spent the day crying as he repeated that I broke our deal, and as I felt like shit because I did.\n\nHe left and came back at night. He kept saying that he felt like shit and that this destroyed the life that he was building. I just kept saying that I am sorry as I cried, I didn't know what else to do. He told me to mend it, but I don't know how. He confessed that he might been too pushy about sex, and I couldn't stop but crying, now in anger. I spent 4 years of my life thinking that there was something wrong with me for not wanting to have sex with him. I spent days forcing myself to do it just to make him happy, I endured pain and he even made me bleed once. During all this time he would get mad from time to time because I didn't satisfy him, and sometimes he even confessed that he came to my home in hopes of sleeping together.\n\n\nLast night he asked me to sleep at my place. He told me that I am his safe space and that he would rather be with me during this times than alone at home. I agreed because I just want him to be ok, and I don't think I have the right to be selfish. He made me dinner for the first time in 4 years and hugged me first when we slept. This morning, afther I woke up at 6AM to go to one of my jobs, he told me that I cheated on him. That it's true that we had an open relationship, but I cheated on him.\n\nRight now I am on my way to my job, holding my tears on the train. I don't know how to feel. I feel like shit for what I did and I don't know. I don't know if I want to leave him, but I don't know if I should keep this relationship. I love him so much, but I cannot deal with this right now. Cheating for me is a deal breaker and I don't know what to do.\n\nI am not looking for advice or for compassion. I just wanted to tell someone. I don't have friends, all of my current friends were his friends first and I don't want to tell them. I don't know if he did, but I will not tell anyone. I am ok with them hating me, I deserve it.\n\nMy roommate told me that that's not cheating. She says that I asked him, we had an open relationship, I had all of his permission to do so, and that he just got jealous and insecure after that. He even confessed that he can sleep with one girl and forget about her, but he cannot deal with the idea of me doing so.\n\nI have to figure this on my own, but right now I am a mess.",

What would you say to that friend? If you can step out for a minute and see the situation from outside... Do you really want to spend the rest of your life sexually unsatisfied? With a person whom you actually communicated the problem and didn't care enough to try to fix it?",

Pretty sure the choices are clear at this point but just to be clear, current boyfriend is using you and manipulating you for his own gain get the he'll away from him asap not a good guy",

I tried to get him to try many things but a lot he refused and The stuff that we did try didn't do much. I've only been with 3men like your ex though but They all seemed to be having a great time (not to brag lmao). But it just seemed like something Was wrong with me, or maybe still is idk? But the relationship eventually soured because we werent Intimate. As you said, It felt like a chore to me. It makes me really weary to get into another relationship..",

A lot of these comments seem to be ignoring your agency is a lot of this and throwing all the blame on Henry. First you should have broken up with him the moment he pressured you into sex, I know it's not that easy but at that point, the relationship should have ended, but since it didn't I'll continue reading this as I would any other open relationship.  \nOpen relationships usually mean being open to sex with others, the emotional connection with the other guy we would normally call \"emotional cheating\" which to me is worse but that is not really a point.  \nHenry sounds like a isn't really putting the effort in, and really needs to reevaluate how he views sex, foreplay is a must for anyone.  I've been with people who aren't super into hugs and physical contact constantly, they get over stimmed and it's a matter of deciding if that's a deal breaker or you are willing to deal with that part of them.  \nBy proposing and you accepting the open relationship Im reading it is didn't take much thinking over and wanted it too? Some seem to be implying he forced it when that's not what Im reading from your text.  \nOpen/Poly relationships are built on trust and boundaries, if the two of you agree to a rule if its been a while you go to each other if you want sex, no matter how dumb these rules maybe you have to stick with them or you violate that person's trust.  \nBut the sex is not what I think people should be focusing on but the emotional connection you had with the guy, you knew your partner was upset after you violated a rule and the person you spent the night with was the guy you violated that rule with? I don't really care what anyone says but that is emotional cheating, especially after your partner said a rule you both agreed on was broken. If you just wanted to break up with your partner and be with the new guy then by all means do that if the relationship isn't working, but do not do it as you are still with another guy.  \nIt sounds like the two of you have inherent incompatibilities. You want more physical affection and a guy who isn't scared of a vagina and he wants to have sex, but you don't want to have sex with him because he doesn't give physical affection. Again, you did cheat, but is that really all bad considering how half-assed this man treats his relationship with you?",

Is being with him worth giving up the intimacy the other guy gave you? Like you could have that as a relationship but you\u2019re too stuck living in the past with your current boyfriend. He is insecure, bad in bed, and selfish in all aspects of life, NEXT.",

You are young and wasting your time in an unfulfilling relationship. You can see you can get another partner easily. Why are you wasting more time being unhappy?",

He also physically abused you after you said to stop. Girl, leave him. Now",

    "postText": "I'm a transgender man who is attracted to other men. Specifically masculine men. I hate the fact that I am ga. This might be internalized homophobia, but I just wish I wasnt gay. I don't want to be a \"homo\". I don't even like calling myself gay. I don't like imagining myself being romantic with another man. It makes me feel feminine and the thought of anything about me being feminine repulses me. I can't live if I don't look and act like a MAN; I don't want to be a man I NEED to be a man. Sometimes it makes me want to just detransition and live my life as a woman, suffering, so I won't feel so I won't be gay. I have nothing against gay people.",

I tend to find that people are strangely putting people into stereotypes while advocating for diversity. Its statistically very possible for a woman to have as masculine a temperment as many men or even a more masculine tempermant than the vast majority of men, but the moment we cross the 50/50 line these days it seems that that exludes you from being able to remain a woman. I imagine I am offending some people here, but it seems a tad regressive to me and I am just trying to understand these cultural movements while hopefully helping with you think through your conundrum from a different perspective. I also think its possible to be a gay masculine man who likes  masculine men and thats not necessarily a contradiction.",

I don't know what you mean by \"masculine temperament\". Are you talking about a masculine personality? I do have a masculine personality but having a masculine personality is useless if I'm biologically a woman. If I'm not viewed as a man. Also it's not really a contradiction but in my eyes I don't view gay men as very masculine. I know these views are ridiculous and untrue but it's the way I was raised and a belief I can't just get rid of very quickly. Being viewed as a man and as masculine aligns with my internal sense of self.",

Seems like a rigid supposition on the nature of men and women instilled through upbringing is clashing with your feelings and subconcience. I am not really sure how to resolve that I am afriad, but I do wish you the best of luck. Ultimately its up to you anyway, just dont be too hard on yourself. \n\nBy masculine temperment I mean having more masculine traits such as higher disagreeability, more aggressive etc. \n\nI dont understand why having masculine traits as a biological woman is useless though. I could see how it might be suboptimal if its from a looks perspective, but hardly irrecoverable, and if its from a tempermant perspective, there are lots of people including myself who prefer more masculine women and a more masculine woman has a substantial advantage in the workplace as well (more likely to negotiate for a higher wage etc). I guess I just dont understand where the sentiment that it is bad to be a masculine woman comes from.",

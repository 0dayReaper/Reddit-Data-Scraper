    "postText": "Hi Reddit. I wanted to vent about something that\u2019s been bothering me. I always wanted to go on family vacations abroad, but my dad never seemed interested, even though he had the means. He would make empty promises and then make excuses about \u201cfinancial restraints\u201d (which is a lie as he makes $16k a month) &amp; this affected me as a child because I would never ask my parents for anything because I thought they could not afford it and this included fun school trips. My father rarely spent time with us. We never had proper family outings. Also, he never took my mother out for dates or anywhere either. He is financially abusive toward my mom. At some point, I felt awkward when he was around. Even though I feel guilty, I still do not like being around when he\u2019s there. He does not treat me badly but he is neglectful. \n\n\nNow, as I\u2019m about to start a full time job abroad in Australia, he suddenly wants to plan a trip abroad. A trip which I will not be included in as I will be working. He didn\u2019t intentionally exclude me but I still feel upset and conflicted about his change of heart and the missed opportunities. It is a norm for our extended family to go on vacations. So I felt neglected and envious for years. My dad always prioritized other things over family moments, even though he could\u2019ve afforded it. \n\nWhy didn\u2019t he prioritize this earlier when I wanted it the most? \nIt feels like he\u2019s only doing it now because it fits his schedule, not because he genuinely values the time with us. He didn\u2019t even bother schedule it before I leave so I can join them. He scheduled it in the same week I am leaving in.",

    "postText": "The picture is beautiful. He had glowing blue eyes and the most beautiful smile. The sun was shining on his golden blonde hair. He looks like an angel in the picture. \n\nThe smile that had been used in every facebook and instagram post was induced by me flashing him to get a nice picture. I forgot about it entirely until I saw an old message to a friend I had sent the picture to before. \n\nSo now, the picture that is mostly posted of him on his family\u2019s social media is his genuine reaction to his girlfriend\u2019s boobs. I think that\u2019s exactly how he would\u2019ve wanted to have been remembered.\n\nEdit: I just checked. It\u2019s also on his obituary.",

My sister came up with the idea and nobody was gonna argue with her about it. It didn't make a whole lot of sense to me really, other than he used to walk all over that town. He never had a car or anything, so we were surely walking the same sidewalks he'd walked a thousand times before. \n\nAnyway, my nephew was fucking hilarious. Like total class clown of the family. He'd do anything, the silliest things to make people laugh. We all met up in a parking lot where we left our cars. I saw the clouds coming in, you could tell it was coming but the timing of it was comical. Literally the very moment we got everyone coordinated and taking the first steps on this idk.. 3 mile walk or so... it starts raining. \n\nAnd I don't mean just a drizzle. This shit was a torrential downpour within 30 seconds. I had a hard time not smiling or laughing the entire way because I just knew how funny he'd find that whole scenario. It was like the last joke he could offer us. Exactly how you describe it. I could almost feel him laughing with me.",

Before my boyfriend died, I did the same thing when taking pictures of him, but since I have no boobs to show him (I'm also a man), I would just try to make him laugh or give him compliments. I still have SO many great pictures of him because of this. He truly had a smile that could light up a room. Whenever he'd smile that big, genuine smile at me, it was like the world froze around us for a second. I've never met anyone else with a smile that could legitimately stop time. I miss him every day, as I'm sure you do your boyfriend. I'm very sorry for your loss. This is a great story, and a great memory to have. Every time someone laments about him on social media, every time you re-read his obituary (which trust me, you will), you'll remember that memory, and it'll make you happy. Hold onto things like that. It'll never stop hurting, but over time a lot of that hurt will be replaced with gratitude that you got to meet and be loved by such a special person, and that you got to make so many lovely memories with him. You'll never forget him and what he meant to you, but you should also never forget how lucky you are to be so sad that he's gone. \n\nYou have all of my love and compassion. Please take care of yourself",

It was an extremely complicated relationship but we worked hard to get along. I took care of him the last 2 years of his life by living with him. \n\nWe\u2019d get into fun little arguments. One of our oddball disagreements was the picture he wanted to use as his memorial photo. He was obsessed with looking \u201cdignified\u201d. He wanted a stern face as he was a former professor. I told him that wasn\u2019t happening. I was using a photo of him smiling. He said that would be next to impossible because it didn\u2019t exist. I told him I would find it. This would make him laugh as he hated his picture taken and only allowed it at formal events. He was the family photographer so it was also hard to find any and he hid when I\u2019d take pictures. \n\nThen I lost him. It was expected but how it happened was extremely traumatic. The only thing that gave me a little consolation was the search for that smiling picture. \n\nI always remembered him smiling so was desperate to have that be his memory. I also wanted him to come haunt me as he had threatened. \n\nIt occurred to me that he only smiled in photos when we were young kids. Those wouldn\u2019t work as we wanted a recent picture. So I searched the grandbaby pictures. \n\nWouldn\u2019t you know it. On the first Christmas with multiple grandkids crawling over him, he held my baby. The smile on his face made my heart sing. \n\nI used it everywhere. It\u2019s a part of family lore now. Our own little inside joke when we look back on a painful time. \n\nI am so sorry for your loss.",

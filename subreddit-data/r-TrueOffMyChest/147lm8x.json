    "postText": "I feel like my mom is ruining my life. When i was 19 (I\u2019m 22 now) I co-signed on a car loan for my mom. I know, If I had to co-sign for her she probably couldn\u2019t afford it or be responsible for the loan. I was 19 though, and I felt pressured to help her especially because I still lived with her. \n\nShe\u2019s never missed a payment, until recently\u2026when i\u2019m actively looking for an apartment. I\u2019ve been living with my boyfriend for over a year so although I moved out I\u2019ve never been through the process of getting approved for an apartment. My boyfriend and I are unofficially renting at his uncle\u2019s home since he (uncle) moved in with his fianc\u00e9. Now we\u2019re looking to get our own official place together. His credit is ehhh, but my credit was great so I wasn\u2019t worried. I have never missed a payment on anything. Now i\u2019m scared we won\u2019t get approved. Her missing that payment tanked my credit score. Almost 100 points for 1 missed payment. \n\nHer excuse is that she\u2019s \u201cdoing this alone\u201d and is struggling. Like i\u2019m not also on my own doing this life shit. I had a conversation with her and told her just to tell me if she couldn\u2019t pay it. I WILL PAY IT. \n\nSo, I go and check my credit card and It notified me of yet another missed payment. Twice now, she has refused to tell me she cant pay and now my score will suffer even more.\n\nMy mom has always relied on government assistance and boyfriends to help pay bills. I have always strived to do opposite of that. I regret helping her because now it\u2019s affecting me and my future. Our current living situation will come to an end soon and im so worried we won\u2019t be able to get approved for anything.",

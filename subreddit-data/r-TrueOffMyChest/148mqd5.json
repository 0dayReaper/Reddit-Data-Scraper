    "postText": "Ok no amount of backtracking or explaining is gonna make me look good so I'm just spilling the truth here\n\nEdit: right I realized im missing out on stuff here and its real unfair on her , she does send good morning text and ask how my day is going every so often, she gave me art gifts on my b'day, \n\nIm a 16m, my gf is 18, she confessed to me a about a year ago on new years eve, now I was 14 at the time and being in a relationship sounded really cool to me so just said yes without really thinking about \n\nnow I want to emphasize we never meet, we met each other through a wa gc and she likes to trauma dump. I was there to comfort her through whatever she was going through, this was my first mistake. After a while we started to chat a bit more, nothing deep just casual stuff, we had conflicting personalities so we don't have much in common but we still talked ,this is my second mistake. After a while she started dropping hints that she likes me which I ignore thinking she was just being nice, third mistake. \n\nThen the confession, she made this WA story about being in love with a guy she just met that comforter her through her rough patches, it's obviously me but I pretended to be oblivious then boom she outright spilled her feelings for me through text, since I don't like rejecting people I just say yes, now this was my fourth and biggest mistake, my people pleasing habit went a bit too far. While we were a couple she bought somethings that associated with me like teddies. She pretends that the teddies is me whe pictured us together with those plushies.i didn't really kidn in fact I thought it was quite cute a the time. But one of the things that stood out was She didn't want to show her face me until she was 18 (I asked her when I was 14 and she was 16) and I was cool with that at the time and forgot about it. \n\nFast forward a couple weeks ago she turned 18 and boom face reveal, she showed me a pic of her. Now I'm not a man of high standards, I'll take personality over looks any day but for some reason when I saw her I just couldn't see myself with her, all this time I'm imagining our future together just went to ash. I don't know what to do, we just did a vidchat for the first time and that solidified my opinion, she is bluntly not my type. \n\nBut now I don't know what to do, she changed so much because of me (not for me I want to make that clear). I tell her I'm proud of her when she goes through breakthroughs in her mental health. So now If i try to pull the plug on us all of that will be gone. And I don't want to be the reason she becomes crushed I want her to be happy, just not with me. \n\nSo yeah im asking you people for advice now, rn I'm going to try to just block her and all of her mutual friends so I can have more time to think about this, feel free to slag me but I do need help this is not a joke\n\nEdit: thank you for all of your suggestions, I'll take a week off cool down and then I'll end things with her, thx reddit",

Is that the sort of relationship you really want to have?\n\nShe'll figure it out eventually, and it'll sting worse.\n\nIt's not her looks. It's that you're incompatible. Just tell her you don't think the long-distance thing is working out anymore.\n\nIf she asks why, as she undoubtedly will, be honest. Tell her that long term you don't think you're compatible and that it might be better for you both to find people who can better meet your needs and who can be there in person when it's needed.\n\n\nOr don't. Honestly, I'm not great at relationships.\n\nThe bottom line is that one of you is going to be miserable no matter what. You're not responsible for how she handles a breakup. The only thing you can control is yourself and your happiness.\n\nShe's using you like a therapist. Not a boyfriend. It's not your job.",

It doesn't happen magically at 18 either. \n\n\nYou are not now nor WILL YOU EVER be responsible for anyone else's mental health and life choices. It's good you're supportive, but you should never support others to your own detriment.\n\n\nNow other people will tell you lying is bad. They are right.  Lying is bad, but it's useful and preferable to destroying someone with a harsh truth. You've got an age difference that can make this easier. She's seen as an adult and you are a child if you're in the US. You don't want to get her in trouble so you tell her you're going to hit the pause button on this 'together' thing  and stay friends. You've got a year or two to back out of this relationship without destroying her. \n\n\nAlternatively, tell her your parents aren't comfortable with her age and distance and don't want you being more than friends.  \n\n\nIn short, lying bad. Truth worse.\n\n\n\nIn the future don't agree to shit online. It's not shallow to have physical preferences. It's a garbage thing to lead someone on however so start backing out of the relationship. If she needs distance from you, give it to her. \n\n\nYou've learned a difficult but valuable lesson.  Lessons often suck.",

            "comment": "Being responsible for someone's heartache is guilt inducing, and I get being reluctant to do it. But, there's a lot to learn in this situation that I hope you take with you.\n\nI want to echo what some others have said on here: you aren't responsible for her emotions and mental health. You can be kind in how you talk to her and try not to maliciously hurt her when breaking things off, but you don't stay out of guilt.\n\nAlso, there's nothing wrong with finding yourself not attracted to her. It's true that it's not everything, but you can't force what isn't there. From what you've said, it seems like the things she says to you are a real turn off, and that's enough to want to exit the relationship. \n\nNext, for the love of all that is holy, don't agree to crap online! \n\nYou're young, and this isn't going to be the end of your world or hers. Trust you intuition when someone is making you uncomfortable, and don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.\n\nAs far as breaking up, decide what you want: a clean break or one where she's still hanging around because she thinks there's a chance one day? I would just tell her that you don't think this relationship is right for either of you and that she should have someone who can be more available to her needs.",

    "postText": "Just came up to one of my coworkers who I saw had Google Maps pulled up on his PC with pins all along the North Shore (Minnesota). \"Going on a trip?\" He showed me the ring missing on his finger. No, his wife of 8 years had been cheating on him the last 9 months.\n\nEarlier this year, in reference to another coworker, I told him \"you can't change the way people are\". He told me that sentence stuck in his mind ever since and he realized: Once a cheater, Always a cheater. He moved out and his ex is buying him out of their (her) house and they're filing papers.\n\nNow in an attempt to feel better he's going on a trip with his dog in what was the family Jeep.\n\nThis guy is a star, excellent communicator, has his shit together and friends with everyone, always extremely thoughtful and rational, and rides a sport bike because why not. This is not the guy you'd expect to be cheated on; he did everything right. I could tell the last month he wasn't excited about anything like he used to be. Now I know why.\n\nBad things happen to good people. Fuck cheaters. And if you're cheating on your spouse, you owe it to them to see yourself right the fuck out.\n\nEdit: We've been reading all the comments. THANK GOD they didn't have any kids together. Cheating is 100% becoming too normalized. ",

Did that to the one girl who cheated on me. She cheated on me with another guy who knew about us. Cut to a few months later, word travels and I hear she cheated on him. Normally I'd not give two shits but watching his public meltdown about how she cheated on him was glorious. I laughed for a good 30 minutes and went back to not giving a fuck about either of them.\n\nI do sort of owe the guy she cheated on me with because he helped me dodge a canon. I hate to think what my life would've been had I been stuck with her. I even told her post breakup, all she had to do was just tell me it wasn't working and we'd have ended it. Oh well. I do miss her family though.",

She began cheating with him while she was in a relationship with her fiance, in a beautiful home, with their two kids.\n\nShe blames her ex fiance because she said if she wasn't forced to \"get a job and contribute\" she never would have met the guy she's cheating with. Which is bullshit because this wasn't the first time she cheated on her ex with someone who was married...\n\nTo make matters even worse, the married man she's cheating with has a beautiful wife and she just gave birth to their third son not too long ago. When this girl asked him how his wife got pregnant (they've been having this affair since before his wife got pregnant) he told her some bullshit story about how he slept with is wife one time when him and the girl he's cheating with were arguing...\n\nThis girl keeps giving him ultimatums saying he better choose between her and his wife soon or she's done (she's super crass too, saying things like \"he needs to choose which p\\*\\*\\*y is better) - but she's been giving him ultimatums for months and he's still with his wife. \n\nThis girl is honestly so disgusting, she told me that he bangs her in her garage on the floor and then leaves and goes home to his wife. She constantly brags about how his wife is suspicious of her and thinks she checks out her instagram all the time. She also brags about how his wife keeps finding her hair all over his clothes - not to mention the instagram posts of \"if you're dating me you have to accept the fact that my hair is going to be all over your stuff\" posts. \n\nIt's honestly so disgusting. I wish I knew the guy's wife, because I would tell her in a heart beat about what's going on. \n\nNobody deserves that.",

Usually, they're a drastically *worse* pick than the main partner, often the type of person nobody healthy would want to date long-term - like the female equivalent to a male incel. The cheating dude is willing to sleep with her when there's no great commitment demanded, but the appeal isn't there to make him do a full relationship switch. So, I think if you dug to the root of this meth-head's weird boasts and fantasies, they probably originate from some level of awareness of her inferior position. If *she* can't have a happy marriage, then *you* shouldn't have one either. It really is almost identical to the incel mindset.",

Not so much my wife at the time deciding to leave, although I loved and still love her very much we were always very different people. It was the fact that my brother, a man I had known since the age of 8 and suffered and sacrificed through sports and life events would go behind my back and sneak around with my wife smiling in my face the whole time &amp; then parade their relationship &amp; little euro trip around on social media after she just up &amp; leaves to stay with a \u201cfriend\u201d. It makes me cringe that two people could be so oblivious to their trashy behaviour.. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t really hurt my ego, i know I did all I could to fulfill my end of the bargain &amp; I have no control over people\u2019s actions or motivations..It sucks that I poured so much time and energy etc into people who were just looking to use me in the end but I\u2019ve never met another man I\u2019d rather be &amp; even if that\u2019s a delusion it\u2019s a lucky one.  \n\nThat is just life, we struggle and grow in unexpected ways I just wish she could have spoken to me and told me if she was unhappy. I am a man who has been blessed in many ways &amp; adding this invaluable life experience will only strengthen &amp; diversify the the rich tapestry of my character. \n\nI use a wheelchair but am still very active, I require no extra care or assistance with any of my personal care, or day to day life. I Drive, dall of my shopping, house work etc. I\u2019m the type of wheelchair user that can\u2019t stand but can do everything else, the most I could ever need from you would be assistance with a very high shelf lol. I am 6\u20195\u2019\u2019 and competed at a high level in athletics for my entire life until I broke my back at 20 so since she left me I have moved cities &amp; become a carded member of my country\u2019s national team in the sport of wheelchair basketball &amp; am continuing to work towards the Tokyo Paralympic games. \n\nLife is good ^_^",

Now I don't know much about you other than what you shared, though what I do know is that they're going to look up to daddy for his resilience and heroism to face the day with honesty, bravery and with great vigor in his heart.\n\nYour brother, your blood, smiling in your face while fucking your wife, your light, behind your back... Man. And you know that it's all because of your condition, she just chose the \"next best thing\" from you and I can't believe your brother actually went with it, too. \n\nIt reminds me of the movie Brothers (Jake Gyllenhaal, Tobey Maguire). Where the character Tobey plays comes back from war and has the suspicion that his brother and his wife had a relationship thinking he was dead. Pretty heavy movie, though.\n\n\nIt does sound like they did you a favor by disqualifying themselves from your life. I applaud you saying that you still love her. Takes guts. She threw something very rare and precious away. Your brother is naive for thinking she won't pull such a thing on him as well if misfortune ever strikes.\n\nI hope God's plan will be in your favor and that your sufferings will be justified in the end. You inspire me and many others with your story. You have my respect. \n\nCheers!",

Fortunately she had the good sense to initiate the breakup, at the time I was in my first long term relationship but pretty soon after I realised it was absolutely for the best and I was much happier for it. We still remain good friends and even though I've moved across the country we still meet up when I'm back at home sometimes. \n\nIt's always far better to end something before it goes properly bad, even if it hurts at the time.",

My first serious girlfriend just did it, and told me with a straight face. My next girlfriend did in a worse manner. Man, I can write a novel for each one, it'd be reviewed as *impossible* if I label them non-fiction.\n\nTo top it off, I've been bullied for six years straight prior to these relationships. I dealt with the damage of all these events for over a decade.\n\nI'm still twisted here and there, but I managed to recover. Lack of empathy deals a lot of indirect damage.

Then one day we woke up in the morning and she was like, you know i still love you and i always wanna be with you, but i feel like i'm at a point where i'd fuck anybody that wants to fuck me. I thought she was joking, but she started crying and said it's how she really thinks. She was my fiancee or however you spell it at the time and that sentence alone was already enough to completely shatter all the trust i had in her. We kept the relationship going for a while longer, since she didn't really cheat on me yet, only told me that she'd want to, but i could never really get into it again. So we broke up. That statement alone killed all my trust, not just in her but in everyone. If a single sentence can already be so devastating, i don't even wanna learn what it feels like to get truly cheated on, let alone catch your partner in the act.",

You know they haven't cheated but you think they might. It's a horrible and devastating feeling.\n\nBut, you broke up, she didn't cheat on you and you still have a lot of offer people if you keep yourself in check with your feelings. Best thing is to communicate with the next person about trust and needing to take time to feel safe. That's perfectly reasonable and most people will respect that. If they don't, that's a red flag imo and I'd be out straight away. People have trust issues due to bad family experiences too where they've been betrayed and abandoned. It's the same thing.",

I made it clear that for me personally there was no coming back from cheating and if that desire, even if it\u2019s not an emotional one, is there, then that\u2019s a sign we need to end things or get some help. To all those people who say monogamy is not natural, the things modern society has evolved to do were not natural at some point either. We don\u2019t have a need to populate the world anymore, if anything it\u2019s the opposite, so the way I see it monogamy is even more important to the future of the world than before. But if it\u2019s not your thing, that\u2019s fine too, to each their own, but it\u2019s why these conversations need to be had in the beginning of a relationship.",

I believed that relationships always ended in hurt and betrayal. I thought cheating was just what people did, and what all men did inevitably. I couldn't identify healthy behaviors, and thought abusive ones were \"love\" or \"normal\" because I didn't know anything else.\n\nBoth my mom and dad married and divorced 3x each (different people, not each other), cheating and being cheated on the whole way. As a result, my dad died a very lonely man whose bedside wish for his kids to visit him was not going to happen on any planet. My mom is estranged from everyone but one sibling, and will likely die equally alone, after thirty years of whining \"it must be nice\" every time she hears about a friend's 50th wedding anniversary or something, with no awareness that some therapy might've helped her out with this.\n\nCheating is fucking evil and selfish, and hurts everyone around you.  If you want to fuck someone else, you break up with the person you are with, OR YOU DON'T FUCK SOMEONE ELSE, BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT RESPONSIBLE HUMAN BEINGS DO.",

            "comment": "Two years ago, I left my cheating, abusive ex. We were together for thirteen years. She cheated on our first Christmas as a couple. I forgave her because she was drunk. Happened again with a different man later. I loved this woman so much that *I* apologized and begged her to stay in the relationship. Repeat this process many times with at least a dozen different men, except it wasn't always that she was drunk \u2014 she was just cheating and lying. Toward the end I was only staying because I was financially unable to move without becoming homeless.\n\nDon't be like me. Don't let someone abuse you like that. Don't let someone try to use alcohol or other drugs as an excuse to mistreat you. For anyone who may be struggling in their relationship, just know that things can and will get better. I've been very happily single for two years now. It isn't all sunshine and rainbows, but my overall mental well-being has improved dramatically.",

The community is great and helps you through a lot of your worst days.\n\nJust got out of an 8 year relationship with someone who cheated the entire time\u2014minus the year he was faithful after I caught him the first time. \n\nLuckily we didn\u2019t have kids so the divorce was pretty clean. But almost a year later and I still have really bad days. I cried for five hours the other night for a multitude of reasons, all stemming back to him cheating and me feeling worthless. \n\nMost days are ok though, so I roll with the punches.",

You finally find someone who truly cares about you and boom you go see someone else? What you want to feel that feeling of new love? Break up with them. What your marriage is falling apart and you see the way to save it is cheating? NO! What you don't feel loved anymore and want to feel loved by someone else? BREAK UP WITH THEM! Cheating is never a mistake. If it's not working out break up. Do not hurt your partner. Even doing it behind their back is just plane wrong. How can you talk about trust in a relationship. If you're gonna go behind the love of your life and do something like that! Just plainly is wrong. Cheating is under no circumstances is ever ok. \n \nThere are people trying to find relationships and here you have people Cheating on their partner. IT IS ABSURD THAT YOU WOULD THROW IT ALL AWAY! If you cheat on your partner you deserve no one. JUST BREAK UP AND STOP BEING SELFISH.",

Or go pound the person they cheated with, to eventually become the one who gets cheated *on.*\n\nNo, not every cheater will cheat again, but once that trust is lost, the whole relationship is fucked and that trust will never fully come back. \n\nGood on him, to leave her and take a trip to clear his mind. I hope he finds someone who isn't a selfish asshole. All the best to him.",

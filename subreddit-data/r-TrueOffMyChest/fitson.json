    "postText": "I'm a part-time student working full time at a grocery store to put myself through school. Everyday, I see all these posts on Reddit joking about how bored everyone is going to be holed up in their house for a month. How I wish I had that luxury. Instead, I get to work in the industry that won't shut down even if the whole country is quarantined, breaking my back to fill products that people are mindlessly hoarding, all while putting myself at high risk of contracting whatever people bring through the doors.  Yesterday, we were handed letters telling us that we are required to stay home without sick pay if we show any signs of being sick. How ironic is that? Forced to stay home FROM WORK from an illness I will inevitably contract FROM WORK, with no incentive of sick pay, no way to pay rent, and likely no job to come back to after weeks of being quarantined. No one treats us as human; not the customers, not our employers. I'm tired to listening to people tell me that my life and safety is worth less than someone else's, that I am obligated to become homeless when I catch the coronavirus by doing my job for minimum wage and allowing people not to starve.",

We've been at less than 20% occupancy for the past week, with no signs of improvement. Broadway shows are all dark. Most major tourist attractions -- closed. So many restaurants -- closed. \n\nSupposedly this lay-off is just temporary, so hopefully I'll have a job again when things start calming down. There's no point in trying to find something in the mean time, though, because there are thousands of other people in the city in the exact same boat as me. So I just have to ride it out and hope that I can make ends meet.",

We scrub our hands raw. We aren't even allowed to wear masks to protect ourselves from breathing in contagions because it will make our precious  customers think we are sick. Money and reputation matters more than we workers do. I fear deeply for my job security, because if I or someone in my household gets sick I will have no choice but to quarantine - it is the right thing to do, to prevent more spread. And I have 5 pets to feed. \n\nI feel you.",

I'm in a higher risk group for some issues related to my health, but I have no real reason to not be there compared to others other than my mind numbing fear of it and seriously high blood pressure. I don't go back until Monday and I'm dreading it every moment. When I'm home, I'm not worried. When I'm at work, I feel like I'm ready to break. I've been doing this for years but the overwhelming amount of testing and the mishandling of infectious specimens has me contemplating quitting a job I can't afford to leave. I've brought up my concerns to multiple levels of management, but it's just met with a \"don't worry about it, you're pretty young\".\n\nAnd it's only gonna get worse as the positive testing rolls in here and our six person department gets more overwhelmed.",

It's a pet peeve of mine to change my gloves after cleaning something, like if I pull trash and I want to disinfect the trash can enclosure and swinging trash door, I change my gloves after deposing of the trash in the receptacle. Or changing gloves afrer touching the toilet and before cleaning the counter, sinks, mirror, filling paper products. But in our homes we usually don't have access to disposable gloves. I blame mythbusters episodes on toothbrush in your bathroom when flushing the toilet and the one on spreading the cold/flu on my germ awareness.",

We are behind and constantly getting yelled at or verbally abused because customers want their meds and they want them now. Like the other thousands of customers my pharmacy serves. Only the pharmacists are respected and even then sometimes we have customers freak out on them over things we cannot control. It\u2019s exhausting and extremely anxiety inducing, but I have no choice because if I get sick and need to stay home, I get written up, whether or not I have a doctor\u2019s note or sick pay I can use, because missing a shift, even if it\u2019s for good reason, is an attendance violation and cannot be tolerated. \n\nEdit: spelling and changed abided to tolerated because it was bothering me. \nAlso edit: I don\u2019t mean to make it sound like others in healthcare get respect, I know plenty of CNAs/Nurses/Caregivers/Medical Assistant\u2019s that get no respect whatsoever. I worked as a CNA and Caregiver and it could feel really demeaning with some patients or families. The point I was trying to make is really I don\u2019t think anyone really in the healthcare system right now is getting respect. But neither are the retail workers/servers/public service workers who are dealing with the insanity of this. Not to mention the millions I left out. And the racism associated with the Coronavirus is just disgusting. I just think we have a lot to work on as a country but also as a whole human race. And one major beginning step would be respect, which maybe will happen one day.",

There was a lot of pressure to work unscheduled hours/days and overtime because some people couldn't go in.  Probably made WAG a lot of money, but got nothing in return for it.\n\nI left and went back into engineering and I'm glad everyday that I did.",

Fuck you. \n\nRetail managers act all high and fucking mighty, and let\u2019s be honest. Half of them probably couldn\u2019t do your fucking job, because they expect team leads to train you.\n\nThankfully, you\u2019re young. Unless you have some sort of respiratory condition or some sort of immune system deficiency, you should come out of this fine. It\u2019s only the immunocompromised, and the very early Gen Xers and older that are at the most risk. They say anyone over 40 is the most at risk, but it\u2019s closer to over 50.\n\nI know you work at the grocery store because the hours are flexible to your college schedule, but try looking for something else when you can.",

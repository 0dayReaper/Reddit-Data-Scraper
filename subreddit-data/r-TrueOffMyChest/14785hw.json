    "postText": "Hello to all my fellow redditors. As we all are definitely aware by now, the majority of Reddit is going dark tomorrow to protest what is truly a terrible change for the community that has been built on this website. Reddit\u2019s CEO and co. have become blinded by their greed and consequently made brash decisions with how the public will now interact with their platform, worsening the experience for everyone. While I\u2019m not here to discuss the nuances of what is occurring, I *am* here to cry about it. My name is u/callmepeaches and I have been a Redditor for 9 years now. I\u2019m 26. Reddit has been a part of my life for over a third of its entirety. I have seen the rise and fall of social medias, but none could ever touch the level that Reddit has reached. A true community of communities. No subject too niche. A place to feel heard. A classroom for learning the minutest of details on whatever your current hyperfixation is at the time. No trouble you haven\u2019t had that someone hasn\u2019t already written a tl;dr about. If Reddit does follow down this path of self-destruction, I will truly be crushed. This is my favorite internet space in the worldwideweb. No other social media\u2019s mortality has affected me so much. And now the age old question, can anyone else relate?",

    "postText": "This is honestly gonna be weird but I just need to speak about it to strangers who can tell me without bias their opinions. \n\nMost recently, I\u2019ve (24f) moved in with my boyfriend (27m). \n\nFrom the beginning of our relationship, he\u2019s always loved my curves. squeezing them during sex, not looking at my face while doing it, just kissing my belly, etc. I just assumed he really liked it. Sometimes if he\u2019s sitting at his desk he\u2019ll pull me over, put his head under my shirt, and kiss it and kinda \u201csuck\u201d on it ? its more like he\u2019s kinda giving me hickies but not really. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t bother me, it used to when we just started dating because I was so confused why he would like that part of my body. I have always felt self conscious (of course :)) about my weight, after gaining a bit during the pandemic and having other guys kinda try to not grab it at all and avoid it. \n\nAnyways, this weekend I found out (don\u2019t ask me how lol) he has an affinity for\u2026 even larger women? Like almost too much. Pays for porn of them doing random things, walking around and squishing their belly. I understand sex work and i get it im not blaming the girls, and I guess all guys have their \u201cthing\u201d but im worried he\u2019s going to try and fatten me up more to get me to look like them (im not too far off, size 14). He already always makes me finish my plate of food even when i\u2019m not hungry, which is completely against my past eating habits (eat when i\u2019m hungry and stop when i\u2019m not). \n\nAm i crazy?",

However, you're treading in dangerous territory anytime someone is not honoring your boundaries. If he is making OP finish the food on her plate or forcing her to gain weight without her consent, that is an issue. It is time to have a serious conversation, and set some boundaries.",

If you're *not* ok with these things, then there's a huge trust issue that you'll need to address with him. Demanding you finish your food probably seemed harmless enough previously, but now with added information, it becomes more sinister. \n\nIf you don't address this soon, it could overshadow many aspects of your relationship. For instance, if he treats you to a nice meal out, it's he just being nice, or is he finding ways to increase your kcal intake? Or if you're going through a rough time and he brings you ice cream? If he notices that you stress eat, will he (even subconsciously) add to your stress or just not be as supportive in getting you out of your funk?\n\nDo you have the kind of relationship that could facilitate a frank and open discussion on these topics? Or is the trust already gone?",

They LOVE getting big women even bigger by having them eat more.\n\nMany of the guys with a feeder fetish will push weight gain even if it has SERIOUS negative health consequences.\n\nI'm not saying this is any kind of fat shamer. In addition to being a big dude myself, I really like big girls too. However, I've seen firsthand the damage some of these guys can do by love Mom and your into super morbid obesity.\n\nMy cousin was always a big girl too and started dating a dude who was as obsessed with her curves and size as your boyfriend sounds. The guy would spend extra money to buy any kind of high calorie item that she like to eat and then watch her eat it. He also did the same thing of making sure she cleaned her plate.  He wrapped all of this up in constant love bombing anytime she was around and every time she ate.\n\nMy cousin, who is only 5'1 and already over 250 lb when she met him gained at least another 150 lb in less than 2 years of dating this guy, to the point where she was well over 400 lb and had serious mobility and breathing issues. Would you believe that this fucker still kept feeding her and actively discouraged her from losing weight?\n\nThe only time the love bombing stopped was when my cousin made even the slightest effort to lose weight so she could stay alive for her daughter.  What finally woke my cousin up was when she found out this dude was cheating on her with an even bigger chick that she was friends with.\n\nThat relationship was almost 10 years ago and she still fighting to lose the weight that she picked up while with him.\n\nThere are tons of guys out there that love curvy girls who won't encourage you to continue to do something that could kill you.",

I'm not trying to weight or kink shame (it's about the unhealthy intentions), but if he's paying for 'even bigger' content that's what he really wants and is not (yet) getting it. The 'makes' you finish your plate of food is weird on its own, but I'd start worrying about deliberate tampering to add additional things that either increase appetite or negatively affect your metabolism. If it was some kink you both shared and wanted that would be one thing, but since it's one-sided and concealed I have reason to believe he's more likely to do underhanded things for the sake of getting what he wants.\n\nI'd start working on an escape plan. Once you have one please leave. If you are in a position to get away soonish and don't think he'll be agressive or hostile with you, start dropping hints about diet and excercise and see how he reacts, both in word and deed. But, if he starts being aggressive, stop and get away. If you are comfortable in your ability to get away, you can potentially prevent him from continuing to pursue you afterwords by 'insisting' on a healthy lifestyle. It would cause him to realize his kink won't be fulfilled and he may simply lose interest. Again, do not do if he starts to get aggressive or you feel threatened in any way.",

I was a size 14 when I met him as well, and again being young and with the first ever person in my life, I thought it was really harmless. At first I was a little happy bc i felt appreciated, like someone could love my body after I struggled with it so much. And at first it was okay to me. He would constantly tell me how beautiful I was and how my entire body would turn him on. But then it was like I wasn\u2019t enough anymore. He wanted me to be bigger. He didn\u2019t come out and say it at first, I just started realizing that he was a lot more into going on dates to restaurants or grabbing food a lot more than usual. He would make me finish my plate and sometimes even try to give me his. He would order big amounts sometimes, and make me feel bad if I didn\u2019t finish it bc I was \u201cwasting his money\u201d so I caved in like every time. Then he told me he wanted me to go on birth control, and the specific one I got was the implant in my arm, and my doctor told me that i could gain up to 50 pounds with it, and with the eating habits, I did. and he loved it. Anytime we would have sex or do something sexual, it was like he went straight for my belly, like that was all I could offer him. It started to be just about that, just about my belly and how much weight I gained for him, and anytime I would try to get him to focus anywhere else, he would just go straight back to it. So I told him that I wasn\u2019t really comfortable with doing what we were doing anymore, and he said he respected that. But it always came back to it. We would fight all the time and he\u2019d say that he would rather I lost all the weight so that I don\u2019t tempt him, and then be upset when I started losing weight. Or sometimes he\u2019d feel disgusted with the fetish and make me lose weight l, just for him to turn around and try and get me to gain again. He made me feel like i had to do what he wanted or he would break up with me (we were a very on and off again couple). Towards the end of our relationship, i was 18 yrs old and a size 18. It started to be where I never really wanted to do anything bc i knew that sex and stuff wasn\u2019t even for me anymore, that I was like some doll of his to use whenever he wanted and that I really wasn\u2019t a person anymore. And it crushed me bc I really did love him. I tried so hard for him to really love me, but again I was just a body to him. He ended up breaking up with me, and I was so broken. I was fatter than I ever thought I would be, and I did not want to date for the longest time ever, bc I felt like at the weight I was at, I would have to find a guy with a fetish like that to even like me. I still do, the weight has been so hard to get off but I\u2019m down to a size 16 again, which doesn\u2019t seem like a huge progress but it has only been 2 years, and the depression I had that first year barely had me leaving my bed for class.\n\nIf he forces you to eat, he wants you bigger. If you\u2019re not comfortable now, I would recommend getting out before it starts getting worse. You might not have same experience as me, but it\u2019s starting off the same way.",

She would force me to gain weight for her sexual gratification (+ to make herself feel better abt her own body). \n\nThis is NOT going to end well, especially if you let it continue. If you're already self conscious, and he continues to pressure you into this fetish, this will only result in resentment and even more body image issues.\n\nSeriously, take this from someone who has been in this situation (though it was more her insecurities and ED than her fetish for fatter people). This can fuck you up. IM fucked up, don't let them change you like that. It can cause EDs and even worse self image issues. Good luck &lt;3\n\nEdit: it's ok if he loves you for you, and doesn't want to change you. But if you are worried he's going to try and make you gain weight, that's because he's already subtly trying to and you're picking up on it (IE him forcing u to finish yr food). You need to set boundaries and put your foot down that you won't let him control your food and body like that. It can seriously impact your mental health having your food  + body controlled in such a manner. It's essentially a breeding ground for an ED later on. Make sure he knows what he's doing isn't something you're comfortable with. Be safe OP.",

This coming from a guy who is also turned on by his fianc\u00e9s curves (but I don\u2019t seek out porn of even larger and larger women - it\u2019s not a fetish for me, sounds like it is for him, nothing wrong with that, just gotta control yourself) it bears remembering that the instant gratification / satisfaction one gets from porn has diminishing return over time and eventually you need to seek out something a little more\u2026. Extreme than your previous material.",

I bet if you told him that you wanted to lose weight he'll tell you that you're perfect the way you are, don't need to change, and maybe even would look good with a few more pounds.\n\nA good partner would support your efforts instead of knock them down.

If he does realize it, he MUST have your consent to continue any further. Hopefully you two can reach a place where both of your needs are being met, and he's not pushing you into things you're not comfortable with. \n\nAs I guy, I know that men can be controlling and manipulative, but sometimes, they are truly well-intended and don't realize the extent of their behavior.",

    "postText": "I\u2019m proud of him, and glad he\u2019s taking such big leaps. But I can\u2019t help but feel like he may leave me. He claims he loves me more than anyone, and that he wants us to have a future, but then comments how my mental and physical health are off-putting.\n\n\nTo be open, I\u2019m not fat. Im actually a few pounds over from being underweight for my height, as it\u2019s hard for me to put on weight. Im not conventionally attractive, but he still calls me pretty, especially when I dress up. \n\n\nMy mental health has always been an issue. Depression, anxiety, mood swings, the works. Im trying to treat them, but they\u2019ll never be fixed.\n\n\nMy physical health is on the lower end. Im not fit, but I\u2019m not entirely healthy either. I come from a family of asthma, and when I was a kid, it was thought to skip over me, but recently, I had an asthma attack. I also have early onset arthritis in my left wrist and in my knees. My back is always in pain.\n\n\nI do what I can to stay at least somewhat fit. I go on walks, I stretch, try to eat healthy, etc.\n\n\nBut it feels like none of it is enough. My boyfriend is very handsome. He\u2019s got weight on him, but it\u2019s evenly distributed, plus he\u2019s working on losing some pounds to look better for his job. His job is incredibly rewarding, and he\u2019s moving into a higher position soon. Again, I\u2019m proud of him, but I feel like all of this is going to make him see I\u2019m not good enough for him, and sadly, I would agree if it came to it.\n\n\nI love him so much, I don\u2019t want to lose him. I want to be better, and I\u2019m trying to be better, but it\u2019s hard when you live in an area where random girls walking down the street are tens with amazing bodies, and you\u2019re maybe a six. It\u2019s hard to work physically demanding jobs when your body craps out so easily. \n\n\nIm a weak candle compared to this bonfire of a man. While I\u2019m doing everything I can to keep my candle lit and fed, I can\u2019t compare. Im not even third best, and I see it, and I\u2019m terrified of the day he sees it too.",

We worked it out and are still going strong but there are good times and hard times ... but it's like this is what relationships are: ups and downs and a lot of work.\n\nBut to me this feels like you have a shit tone of insecurities and fears and issues and you are projecting a lot of them unto him and his choices!\n\nI am sorry to say this, but to an insecure human every other human that is calm and collected seems emotionless or stoic. That ain't the case! As a woman who had a lot of trauma to work through (i was dead scared to ask strangers for directions or even \"what time it is\", for ex), my husband seemed almost robot like. But that was my anxiety talking, nor reality! He himself is a product of trauma and he himself has fears and worries. He just deals with them in another way!\n\nMy only advice is: seek help! Better yourself and improve yourself also! If your mental health is better, your relationships will be also!",

I\u2019ve been battling with a lot of mental health issues and I\u2019m trying to see past them and tell myself it\u2019s just a bad spell. It\u2019s hard. Especially in recent events.\n\nIm glad I finally got a comment that isn\u2019t just outright saying to leave him. Part of my brain wants to, but a bigger part of me wants to stay. I\u2019m in constant battle with my own head so to not only hear but have a similar experience with someone is comforting in a strange way.\n\nI\u2019m trying to work on my mental self. I want to get therapy but as of right now, it isn\u2019t possible and there\u2019s not a lot of people I can turn to. So I have to rely on myself for now, which is proving to be not such a good idea.",

Start trying to make your life better. Work on areas you think you need to. He'll see the improvements or the effort you are putting in. Incremental progression is powerful. You don't need to do everything all at once. This will serve doubly for you because your confidence in taking control will really improve along with your life. \n\nWhat will drive him away? Keep saying you don't feel you are good enough for him,  and you're afraid he'll leave you over and over. Because you know what things you could do to improve your life, and he's hinted at it. It's an easy out just to say \"I'm not good enough\" and do nothing, or keep doing the same things you're doing. Ask him what would mean the most to him for you to work on. \n\nWhy not take control and give it your best shot. If it doesn't work out, you'll have proven to yourself you can be better than who you were yesterday.",

If you want to save your relationship, I recommend going to see a therapist not about him but about your own issues. \n\nSeeing a partner improve should make you happy, not scared. That you get scared shows a unhealthy attachment from your part",

I suggest, besides the therapy if you aren\u2019t doing it you should, and to focus that negative energy into some kind of art. Painting, poetry, writing, music anything. Creative outlets is great for this sort of thing",

We both want things to work, but if they don\u2019t, then that\u2019s how life goes. That doesn\u2019t mean either of us will seek out other people, but it\u2019s a thought that comes through even perfectly stable relationships.\n\nWe\u2019re human, and humans seek comfort. Sometimes comfort can die in current situations, so people split, or go with the undesirable route of cheating on their spouse when they don\u2019t want to leave what they\u2019ve settled into, even if there\u2019s no comfort left.",

Take a break, find a good therapist who can help you work through some of your issues.

Long story short, after breaking up, ALL my health issues went away, my hair was growing faster, my skin got clearer, I lost excess body fat, and my mental health improved. I also got this indescribable eye pain for years while with him, which immediately disappeared after dropping him. My ex was a very good looking guy and with a hot body, but after breaking up, he withered away like a dried up plant. \nYour boyfriend is dead weight. He is ENERGY VAMPIRE. Men do this when they want to take advantage of a women's positive energy. Whether or not you get better after breaking up, dropping dead usless weight like him will be a huge start for a better life.",

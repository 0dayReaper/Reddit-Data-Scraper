    "postText": "I\u2019m in a friend group, but I\u2019m mostly close to two people in the group, Lexi and Nara (these are only fake names btw not their real ones\ud83d\ude2d). So that made us a trio. Everyone knew we were really really close friends, I mean it was obvious, whenever there was groupings in class, us three would always be together.\n\nBut then Lexi starts distancing herself from us and started being closer to another person. Me and Nara, noticed so we confronted her about it. Lexi said that she felt left out because Nara and I always talk about reading and Lexi wasn\u2019t a huge fan of reading so she\u2019d usually find no interest in our conversation. Lexi also said that she thought I was annoyed at her.\n\nI usually get annoyed every end of the day at school because I feel stressed so I reassured her that I wasn\u2019t annoyed at her and I was annoyed at everyone (which sounds like a bad thing I know but I wasn\u2019t targeting HER).\n\nThen Nara and I told her that we\u2019d do our best to include her. We started being friends again and this time we avoided talking about reading and talked about the topics she liked. Whenever I planned on going out, Lexi\u2019s the first person I\u2019d invite.\n\nThis time, she\u2019s doing it again. And I don\u2019t know why, and I didn\u2019t bother confronting her about it. It started when we were grouped into 4 members for a project. Obviously Lexi, Nara and I were in the group. And since this was a 4 person project, someone joined (lets call her Ems)\n\nLexi started being close to Ems and they became really good friends. \n\nI wanted to go shopping so I invited them. Nara couldn\u2019t come so it was just me and the other two. I arrived at the mall and we started chatting. But it seemed like Lexi and Ems had their own hangout, because everytime I finished talking, they\u2019d continue on like I wasn\u2019t there. We also went to a cafe but as soon as Lexi and Ems got their orders, they immediately left, not waiting for mine. For the whole \u2018hangout\u2019 they were basically hiding from me. And when I was finally with them again, they\u2019d take pictures together, not bothering to invite me. I went home, didn\u2019t even say goodbye.\n\nThe next week, Lexi started distancing herself from our friend group and only started hanging out with Ems. At this point I didn\u2019t even care. If Lexi doesn\u2019t want to hang out with us then fine. \n\nA few weeks passed, we only ever talk to each other if it\u2019s important. Lexi stops eating with us, she stops texting us. She even left groupchats. Then one day, Lexi posted on her insta story saying \u201cthe fact that I lost all of my friends irl and they were my only friends.\u201d\n\nIt was obviously about us. And I was mad because oh how could\u2019ve that happen? It was her fault for just leaving the whole friend group without any word. It was like her post was blaming us. Nara and I tried our best to include her, but she just went on with Ems. I honestly don\u2019t mind if she wants to be with Ems more because they share more interests, but that doesn\u2019t mean she should just dump all of her friends then post it on her story. Ems and I are still friends so why couldn\u2019t she?\n\nEms also had a really really close friend. She was in a duo. But Nara told me that her friend cried because Ems also started ignoring her.\n\nIt\u2019s the fact that these two, Ems and Lexi, just connected immediately and throws away their friendships like it\u2019s nothing. \n\nMy teacher talked to Nara and me privately, my teacher noticed how Lexi wasn\u2019t apart of the group anymore. I told my teacher everything, then my teacher said that she found Lexi crying and said that she misses us and the whole group. My teacher advised us to rekindle our friendship because school year was ending and that our friendship will go to waste. \n\nI\u2019m having mixed feelings about Lexi. She already left us twice. I probably won\u2019t be close to her again and I\u2019ll only talk unless its important but other than that, idek.",

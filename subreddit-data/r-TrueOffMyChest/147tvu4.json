    "postText": "Disclaimer: on my phone, not a native English speaker.\nAs the title says Valentine's Day is today in my country. It is solely a romantic celebration (not friend to friend as in the USA). I got a divorce in 2019. My ex of over 20 years of marriage NEVER posted a picture of us online because his social media was solely business/work related (so he claimed). \nIf you're following my train of thought you know where this is going. Today (not by far the first time) he posts a picture with his 20-years younger girlfriend and a bunch of lovely words describing his love for her.\nNo, I don't want him back. She did me a huge favor and she can keep him. It just puzzles me how much of an effort he puts into this relationship while I am here with my son and no effort was EVER put into us.\nThanks for letting me vent.",

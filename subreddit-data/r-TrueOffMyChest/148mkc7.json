    "postText": "I have been with my job now for about 9 months. There is a position open within the company that could skyrocket me into my wanted profession. \n\nI was granted an interview, the interview was supposed to be last week. I ended up being sent home sick with bronchitis so I genuinely thought I was not going to get the chance anymore as I missed 2 and 1/2 days. \n\nMonday I reached out to the manager and asked if it was still open, he assured me it was and today we had the interview. \n\nI completely bombed it. I felt so blindsided, I was sweating, my face ran hot, I didn't answer to the fullest of my ability. I knew the guy as he is my manager, but I just lost everything I prepared for. Afterwards I felt so idiotic, like I just played myself. I have been wanting this position since I started. I was always told I'll get in there, things changed and instead of automatic promotions like it used to be they are interviewing for them. \n\nHe told me that he would have an answer for me by Friday. We'll see. \n\nI just feel like I bombed it, I definitely made myself look like I was slow. IDK, This position would have helped me so much (it was an $8 raise) I just want to move up. I want to not be so bored, this would give me plenty of things to do instead of sit at a desk and wait until someone needs help. \n\nI need something, I need more education, but I also feel I just need a chance. Just give me a chance I'll show you what I can do. I can prove to you I'd be good in that position just put me in it. IDK. \n\nMaybe my mom was right. I am a loser.",

But i face this in daily life. I don't use instagram or any other social media because i am afraid, i will get to see another video from a girl saying why she will never date a short guy or how unworthy short guys are. I don't know why women do that? If you like tall guys that's ok. But why you to Praise tall dudes and telling short guys how unworthy they are?\n\nEXAMPLE OF DISCRIMINATION IS IN THE COMMENT.",

Although I think it\u2019s indicative of a mindset\u2026 and that when/if you get an extra 2\u201d or 3\u201d, you\u2019ll still feel insecure - if not about your height, then about something else. \n\nBelieve it or not, the overwhelming majority of people don\u2019t really care how tall you are. Just out of curiosity, how old are you? It\u2019s normal to feel like this if you\u2019re younger. Eventually you reach the point where you finally realize nobody out there gives a crap, and the people who do, you don\u2019t want to know in the first place. \n\nI mean I guess another extreme option might be be moving to Southeast Asia or Asia where the average height is around that same number.",

Better be short than in a wheelchair\nAnd you'll be shorter.\n\nNever heard anyone making fun of short guys.\n\nInstagram contains the most toxic shit ever and don't represent the reality. This is even scary the stuff you see and some weird preconceptions being perpetrated. \n\nHeight is part of the stuff you can't control and thus needs to accept. I understand but you are creating your own hell battling with something you cannot change.\n\nAnd you could be the most perfect human being, there will exist people hating everything you are. So it has nothing to do with height. But your brain fixated on this belief. And seeks to confirms it.",

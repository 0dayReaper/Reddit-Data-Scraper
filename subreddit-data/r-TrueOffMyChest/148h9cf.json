    "postText": "Literally the title. My entire (dating age) life, I have been surrounded by my friends dating abusive men. ages 15-30ish, at least one of them always has an abusive boyfriend. Whether that is physical, emotional, psychological, financial, spiritual, substance, or verbal abuse, someone is always in that predicament.   \n\n\nI am not blaming my friends for the abuse or anything like that. But none of them will see the abuse after multiple talks with me, multiple interventions, multiple examples of how they are fitting whatever type of abuse, etc etc. I can't do literally anything that will make them think otherwise or get out of the relationship and save themselves and their sanities. But I am always the one they come to after they finally break up with their boyfriends and come to the light.   \n\n\nI am just tired of it. I am tired of having to watch my friends be abused. Because if I don't continue to be around and watch it, I'm \"leaving the friendship\" because of their bfs, and that isn't okay to them. I am called a bad friend, a bad person if I explain to them how the abuse is affecting them and me and everyone else in our group of friends. But if I stay silent about it, I \"let it happen\". There is no winning. There is no real logic in these situations. But I'm honestly just so done with dealing with this same scenario in 17 different flavors my whole life. I want to be erased from these narratives but I don't know how to do that without cutting people out completely.   \nI don't know. There isn't really a solution or anything that I'm looking for. I just needed to vent. Because I am TIRED of watching my friends be in abusive relationships. ",

            "comment": "I can totally relate to this. I admit, it wasnt multiple friendships, but I had one good friend that was in an extremely abusive relationship and kept going back to him after I successfully convinced her to leave him. Like... 10 times.\n\nIt was frustrating. And it ate me from the inside because all I could do was watch her get broken and then picking up the pieces over and over again to glue her together again. It was PAINFUL. \n\nAnd I left that friendship. I told her if it wasnt her intention to listen to my advice, then I dont see a point in giving it to you. I made sure she knew she could always come to my place in case of an emergency, if she was in real danger or ready to finally leave she could always call. I would always acompany her to the police etc. But I wasnt gonna stand there and watch her get beaten up one more time. I just couldnt. \n\nShe never called.",

According to her, she should have done it earlier and now she has invested too many years of her life to leave him and start over again with someone different. I couldn't believe her when she gave me that reason. He's been her only boyfriend her all life so I believe that because she never had anything different she thinks that she's happy with him.",

Angry when she doesn't get her way, angry when people don't let her push them around. That one's husband is coppin to it, and that only ramps up her behavior. \n\nIt's pretty tiring to watch, but I gotta be there for them, they're family at this point, and I want to make sure they get out okay, especially the fella with the Narc wife.

Cycle continued every couple weeks just a different flavor. Finally I threatened to call the cops on him at a friends wedding bc he was drunk, high and belligerent and wouldn\u2019t leave the hotel room me and some friends were hanging out in.

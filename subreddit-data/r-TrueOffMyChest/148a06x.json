    "postText": "Before I start, yes I\u2019ve been diagnosed with ocd an it is almost certainly the cause of this I know already.\n\nEver since I was a kid I would pick my nose and eat it. Every authority figure who saw me do it would try an get me to stop but I just got better at hiding it. I carry hand sanitizer everywhere and scrub my hands a lot so I don\u2019t spread germs so I\u2019m not hurting anyone either. Your mouth and nose are connected anyway so your spit is already mixed with it all day every day I personally don\u2019t see the issue. \n\nI moved to a place with a dryer climate and one of the best developments has been the blood and scabs in my nose. I\u2019ve also ate the scabs off my body and the blood from scrapes growing up. Something in my brain doesn\u2019t want any piece of myself to be left behind so when skin peels off, I draw blood, or pick my nose I have to eat it or I end up with panic attacks through the day. \n\nI know that everyone on earth thinks it\u2019s gross so I never tell anyone or talk about it ever but it\u2019s been a long day so I\u2019ll let this off my chest to make room for bigger secrets in my brain. \n\nSomething about the iron taste an crunch n squish texture soothes the itches in my brain in the same way washing dirt out of my hair is reliving. I have no other way to describe it but it is probably something I will never stop doing.",

    "postText": "Hey, \n\nFirst of all, let me tell you about my background. I've been doing sports since I was little and have had athletic talent since the beginning. My first sport was soccer at the age of 5 and my dream at that time was always to become a professional soccer player. At the age of 6 I also started playing tennis on the side and showed talent in both sports, but was even stronger in soccer. When I was 9-10 years old I also joined a good soccer team where I would have had serious chances to become a professional later on. But to make it short, I didn't manage to progress from there, because I played a lot of soccer and tennis at the same time and didn't set a focus. When I was about 12 years old, I stopped playing soccer because I was no longer satisfied with any club and then I also had some successes in tennis, but then I also stopped playing tennis when I was 14 because I didn't enjoy it anymore. When I turned 15 and had pretty low self-esteem and started self improving a lot. I started gym and boxing at the same time, because I wanted to gain more respect and got physical results very quickly. I did not intend to do amateur fights directly, but since then I have been doing weekly sparring sessions and by now I could fight definitely attend an amateur fight if I wanted to. Then this winter when I was 16.5 years old, through good nutrition, boxing and lifting weights, I managed to weigh 75kg (165lbs) with a height of 178cm (5ft10) and still be relatively lean, which is why I felt more confident than ever, definitely got more respect from those around me and wanted to keep going from there. However, 3 months ago I got back into soccer by chance and a good team nearby is re-forming and I got an offer to play there and be in a good league again. I will be 17 in a few days and I am aware that it is probably too late now to get anywhere near the professional level. However, for 3 months now I've been playing a lot of soccer again and neglected the gym and boxing and also got much thinner, meanwhile I've lost 5-6 kilos and notice how I'm much weaker. Soccer makes me more fun at the moment than gym and boxing, but at the same time I also don\u2019t want to have much less strength than before, because I feel as bad as I did a few years ago, when I was still quite skinny and that really hits me mentally a lot recently. I kind of feel like playing soccer turns me back into this skinny boy I moved on from, if I were to say it quite dramatically.\nThat I can fight now has given me a lot of self-confidence and so I thought that I should maybe continue with soccer and boxing and then stop with gym as a solution, but I then have the feeling that if I can fight but then weigh almost nothing, people who can not fight but are much bigger and stronger can theoretically beat me up in a street fight and this thought tells me that boxing without gym brings me nothing if it is purely about self-defense. Of course, I am aware that street fights should always be avoided, but still, this offends my conscience and ego quite a bit, and especially because I started boxing for the sole reason of being able to defend myself. \n\nI'd be very grateful if anyone has read this far, because I've been thinking about it for months and haven't come to a conclusion, so I'd be very grateful for any advice and personal experience. Boxing and Gym give me the confidence that I\u2019ve always wanted, but I feel like that deep down I don\u2019t want to do them and rather play soccer, but I don\u2019t wanna lose everything I gained from the two sports.",

    "postText": "For some context when I was in the 6th grade I trusted the wrong person telling him who I had a crush on which lead to him ruining my chance with her fast forward to the second semester of the 7th grade I moved to a new area and a new school I made friends and had a decent school life but then this classmate call him Juan started annoying me about who I had a crush on which was triggering my feelings from my last school I didn\u2019t want to entertain his questions but I knew if I told him I liked nobody he wouldn\u2019t believe it and if I told him to leave me alone he would make things awkward for me with him being on the higher side on the social totem pole so l lied pointed at a random girl I thought I\u2019ll never have anything to do with call her Vicky he was satisfied even disgustingly suggesting I liked her for her big rack then left me alone telling everyone which I knew was going to happen from previous experiences but this lie became the permanent truth that I couldn\u2019t get rid of everyone except Vicky\u2019s cousin Andrew to our adulthood present day believes that lie no matter how many times I tried to clear it up it just made them think I\u2019m denying it out of embarrassment or something this also lead to years of bad blood between Vicky and I. \n\nShe began hating me for allegedly crushing on her which grew stronger when we ended up in the same friend group due to having mutual friends I even became close friends with her cousins Andrew to this day but back then she assumed I was using him to get to her even though I never really talked to her unless we were with the group even when I tried to at patch things up she would just wait for a justifiable excuse to verbally attack me leading to moments where she tried to drunkenly brake my Wii  U when it was game night with my guy friends (she was there only yell at me for being too honest) to even coming to my house to verbally fight cuz she knew I lived near Andrew.\n\nEven my mom believed the lie being told about my alleged crush by my friend that caused some annoying moments with my mother.\n\nBut one good thing from that lie was becoming a super honest person because of it and Vicky and I don\u2019t talk anymore and honestly I couldn\u2019t be happier although I heard from Andrew she became a young mother and is on a redemption tour with all the people she was toxic too but I guess I\u2019m not apart of it but not like I\u2019m gonna forgive her that easily.",

Respectfully, I don\u2019t need educated on the matter from yourself. There\u2019s loads of ways people can suffer from PTSD however what you mentioned is closer to \u201csomebody made me upset\u201d",

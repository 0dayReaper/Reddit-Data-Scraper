Honestly, I\u2019m just trying to make it through each day just as much as anyone else. \n\nI don\u2019t like confrontation, and working in IT I know better than to spill my heart out on visible social media. So, Reddit is where I come. To scroll, to get new perspectives, ideas, to get some good gossip, to laugh, to connect, etc. The last few days I\u2019ve just really missed my groups and being able to be passionate about the goofy things that make my life special. \n\nRedditors have the power to change stocks, lives, any vicinity in this world and we\u2019re continuing to prove that. I just miss my virtual bubbles.",

What are some of the goofy things that make your life special?",

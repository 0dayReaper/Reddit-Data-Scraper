    "postText": "She lives one appartment beneath us and I really hate her. I am studying in a big City and to find an affordabel appartment is really difficult. But i was lucky. At least I thought i was lucky. \nIn the last week before the semester started I found an appartment: 20 min apart the university  by foot, new kitchen, 2 bathrooms, one big living room, and 5 seperated rooms. A bunch of friends  and I rented the apartment and moved in. \nThe first day I lived there I knocked at my neighbours doors and introduced myself (My friends didn't like the idea so I went alone). First we talked to our direct neighbours, an elderly couple who invited me for coffee and talked about how nice it is that I came down to them. They are the most adoreable neighbours there are. The second one where also students, we drank a beer and they warned me about a certain neighbour who's very militant when it comes to house rules. But they were nice, too. Two out of three direct neighbours are a living dream. The next day I knocked at the appartment beneath our. Right at the door I heared a women shouting at her children. As soon as I knocked the shoutimg stopped and the door was opened by an approximately 40 to 45 year old women.  Like I did it the times before, I said \"Hello, my name is Alex (changed) and yesterday \nwe moved into the apartment above yours.\" When she replied \"Okay, what is the reason why you're telling me this?\" \nI honestly was startled and didn't really know what to tell to her so I just said: \"Well it is common procedure to knock at your neighbours doors when you move in a new home.\"\nShe only smiled flimsy and thanked me for, I quote \"Respecting this tradition\" and shut the door again without a further word.\nThe next week we wanted to party a little. My had the quest to inform the neighbours. When he came back he walked up to me and meant that the neighbour from beneath was really upset. At this evening (A saturday) the police visited us for the first time. The following week we watched a movie.... The officer watched with us for about half an hour and explained that the madam from beneath was doing this to the former tenants, too. Today, we repeatedly watched a movie and at nine o'clock she stood in our door and screamed like a dying animal. \nThe elderly neighbours came out of their apartment find out what's going on and when they saw her standing there they meant: \"Karen, (changed) this is the reasom why we all voted against you at the tenants meeting!\"",

    "postText": "I really wish I could stop feeling; I honestly cannot remember a single time that my feelings didn't end up making everything worse or making me feel bad. I try to focus on myself and my development, but it's almost impossible to not think of what could be when I meet a woman that seems perfect. But it never works. It never even starts. Dating in this era is fucked up, and the older you get the fewer available people, and of the ones that are available, half of us have some deep shitty trauma that does nothing but get in the way every single time. I'm 27 and I've lost hope already; can't even imagine when I'm older how much worse will it be. Sometimes I seriously think it's some sort of divine intervention or the universe or whatever that is pushing me towards my real purpose and what I have to do or be in my life, which apparently does not include that happiness. At the end of the day very few people remember if you were actually happy once you die. It's a legacy that marches on. I just want to not feel or be attracted to someone, but it eventually happens one more time. So fuck me I guess.",

            "comment": "I can relate to your post. And I\u2019m deeply sorry to hear that you\u2019re feeling this way. \n\n\nWhat really helped me was when I realized, like *really* consciously understood that I was breaking my own damn heart. So to explain that- when I start to get feels about someone- I tend to play out the relationship in my head (how I want it to go) and that sets up an expectation. Once I evaluated that behavior, I realized that those expectations were EXTREMELY distorted. I also realized that I made a lot of assumptions based on my own cognitive biases about the person I was interested in too. \n\nWith that understanding- I have been trying to change my behavior and it\u2019s been slow but still successful. When I go into that fantasy mode about someone- it has become almost instant now- I will stop myself and internally say \u201cDo you really want to upset yourself based off of your own fairy tale?\u201d Which helps snap me back into reality. \n\nI hope this helps you. It literally took me way too long to figure this out. I\u2019m way older than you.",

It takes a lot of time and conscious effort to make it a habit. Just keep reminding yourself that you are hurting yourself by fantasizing about relationships. Like just try to think about it once a day at first then increase until desired effect is achieved. You won\u2019t even notice at first but it will become a habitual thought.  \n\nPlease don\u2019t beat yourself up about this either- I\u2019m sure most people do the same thing by default.",

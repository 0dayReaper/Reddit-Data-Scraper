    "postText": "I feel so bad about this and I feel I am a bad person. Long story short I come from a family of 12 people. I only have two brothers and come from a single parent household. The remaining are my cousins and aunt plus her two children. \nMy mother is divorced and we moved away from my father. My mother has always brought relatives over to stay with us. She claims its for their education. We are not that well off we struggle to make ends meet and live from hand to mouth. Well, my mom insists we must always be willing to accommodate them. If it comes to food, we should share equally even if it not that much.\n\nMy resentment has grown the past year after my aunt came to stay with us. My aunt came from an abusive marriage with her two children. She had nothing and we were willing to accommodate her. My mom hustled, started her a business, and got her on her feet. She rented her a house and sent her on her way to live on her own with a kids. She is still running the business, moved back to live with us and honestly I can not stand her.My aunt mismanaged her funds, and does not contribute anything to the house. My mom is paying all the bills while she spends her money on clothes and jewwellery. She expects that my mother has to do everything for her and her children. She does not respect boundaries too and takes people's stuff without asking. (I have two phones lastweek she took one without asking)\nI understand its my mother's burden to bear but I feel that my extended family is taking advantage of her especially my aunt. Two of my cousins have parents and the father takes all his money to church living my mother with burden of raising them.) \nThe other cousin his dad is a full blown alcoholic so my mother feels obligated to look after his children.\n\nI have recently graduated and just wish to find a job and move away from home. My mother refuses to enforce boundaries and I am disgusted.\n\nAm I a bad person for resenting my aunt? I don't resent my other cousins much because I understand their family situation. I just feel that my aunt as a 36 year old being should help my mom out since she is here. Yet she sits as if she does not earn money. She always insists she has no money and everything is expensive ? I don't want to use the word hate because it is too much. \n\nWhat should I do ?",

You're a teen and I'm only 7 years older than you but wow. If I had used the energy I used for hatred and disdain for something useful I would've been so much better off.\n\nAll I can say is: this is part of it. This pain you feel, part of it. The silly romance antics; part of it. Just please don't go overboard. I did a lot of things in the past that I now regret.",

The way a boy treats a girl will shape the way he treats relationships. There's a very good chance that if he's burning through women; likely, he burned someone else before dating you, he'll burn her too.\n\nJust don't take him back, and don't keep him in your life as a \"friend\" because he doesn't deserve that title. If he tries to reconnect, tell him off. Tell him if he could easily just drop feelings for someone on a whim, then he doesn't have any feelings or principles about any kind of relationship that you'd think is worth keeping around.",

He will use your former bond and just abandoning you and immediately hooking up with another girl to his advantage. Basically, you feel worthless because he made you feel that way by making you see that you were easily replacable.\n\nSo all he has to do is rekindle your worth by wanting to maybe work it out again when he inevitably comes to you because he \"misses you\" and wants to hook up. Then, of course, soon as he does, he's back on the dating scene again with another girl.\n\nDon't give him that. Even if you agreed, do not reach out to him at all, and when he reaches out to you, read between the lines. Anytime he says \"I miss you\" just remember that he dumped you, and hold him at bay. \"You'll get over it.\"\n\nThat's all you gotta say. Cause when he thinks you're still hurt or playing hard to get, he'll try harder to get some. To which you can say \"so, you didn't actually want to be friends, you just wanted to keep me on the hook whenever you felt lonely?\"",

That is who he will always be.\n\nRemember, if he hooked up with someone immediately after dumping you, then it's clear that he doesn't know how to keep relationships. He just knows how to keep girls like you on the hook with the promise that \"oh, MAYBE we can get back together.\"\n\nBest revenge you can get is being the one he let get away. That's all you gotta do. That's all you have to do. Make him realize if he still wanted to hook up with you, he shouldn't have just dumped you and dated someone else the next day. Never forget that. Never forget that he was clearly with another girl not even 24 hours after he left you.\n\nNever, ever let him live it down. Ever. Cause if he can be friends with benefits, he will. If he can just roll on up and you'll throw what he wants at him without him having to do anything more than just say \"hey, I miss what we had\" then you're as easy to get back as easy as you were to let go.\n\nSo just ask yourself... do you really want to be easy? I'm sorry to be harsh, but, learn from my mistakes when I was a teen. He let you go. So leave him behind.",

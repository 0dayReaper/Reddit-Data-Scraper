    "postText": "This is my first post and I don\u2019t know what I am doing. I\u2019m also going to use fake names for obvious reasons.\n\nI (18f) get really uncomfortable around one of my dad\u2019s (43m) friend (45ishM) whenever he\u2019s around. We\u2019ll call him chad.\n\nContext: They both met at their job and became close. I knew him since I was a kid. Even when I was younger I still felt weird about him and to this day I do my best to avoid him whenever he\u2019s at my house. Also, a few years ago I have been assaulted by someone who was my friend at the time and I never told anyone besides my boyfriend and my now close friends.\n\nToday my dad told me Chad was coming over. I immediately left the house to go buy things I needed. I mostly bought stuff to start my crochet hobby. I came back and he was still there. I thought nothing of it and just went to the living room to start my crochet project while my dad and Chad talked outside. Chad came in the house to use the bathroom and saw me crocheting. He asked normal questions like \u201chow are you\u201d and \u201cwhat are you doing\u201d? I responded talking about the project I\u2019m doing. He gives me a look as if I\u2019m a prize at a carnival. It feels like he\u2019s touching me with his eyes. It\u2019s the same look given to me before I was assaulted by my friend. I feel uneasy and go back to what I\u2019m doing. He sits down on the couch and looks at my project and asked with a sour face \u201chow\u2019s your boyfriend\u201d? I said that he\u2019s good and that he\u2019s at work in his hometown. \u201cHis face from sour grew more annoyed when I talked about him. Looking at my project again I just showed him so he can stop looking at me. He\u2019s face immediately changed and he congratulated me on well I\u2019m doing and said that it was amazing for being my first project. Later, it was dinner time and Chad was staring at me the entire time we ate. Chad will only look away when my dad was talking to him. I finished my meal as fast I can and basically ran back inside to continue my project. My dad texted me to see if I was okay and just said I was tired. I don\u2019t know what to do and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overthinking and/or overreacting.",

Life can be very hard on all of us, and our suffering is valid and relative to our circumstances. \n\nI don\u2019t know what it is you want to escape from, as it could be any number of awful things. I sincerely hope there is a possibility for better things in your future. Time and distance can make all the difference, I really hope that whatever is going wrong is something you can get away from.",

    "postText": "A little backstory: I recently (last year) got out of a horrible long-term abusive relationship of 13 years.  In my last relationship, I was verbally, emotionally, and sometimes physically abused.  I lived in a perpetual state of depression, loneliness, and fear.  I stayed because we were financially secure and because (as most abusive situations are) things weren\u2019t always terrible 24/7.  Sometimes my ex was kind and affectionate other times cold, cruel, and terrifying.\n\nBut I eventually found the courage to move out and start a brand new life with my boys (13 &amp; 16) in a new cute town on the east coast.\n\nIt took so much work and building from the ground up to even get where I am at now.  Despite feeling lonely and wishing I had a partner, I waited a long time to date again because I wanted to heal and do things right.  I wanted to be in a good place when I started dating and in a mindset that would help me find the healthiest relationship possible.\n\nI recently got to a place where I felt I was in a better head space and life situation (got a fabulous new job, in good physical shape, etc) and it was time to look for somebody to share this great new life with.\n\nSo, I downloaded some dating apps and began the search.\n\nI dated a few people, but ended up becoming more and more interested in one man in particular, let\u2019s call him, \u201cGabe.\u201d  \n\nAt first, Gabe was not my first choice.  He seemed cute, but a little bland and boring and underwhelming.  He was nice, but didn\u2019t appear to have a lot of personality.  \n\nHe is a single father who seemed to have a pretty peaceful, well-put together life.  He really did seem to be a healthy option for a partner, so I continued to get to know him.\n\nAs I got to know him, he just became more and more delightful: he was articulate, self aware, kind, emotionally intelligent, playful.  He waxed poetic on life, just had a beautiful way of looking at the world.  We also shared a lot of viewpoints and beliefs.  He would say things that I had thought or felt before that I hadn\u2019t expressed out loud.\n\nWhen he invited me on a date, I accepted.\n\nOur first date was amazing.  We laughed and teased each other, I felt the spark for sure!  Our first date was like something out of a romantic novel.  I\u2019ve never experienced anything so special, so connected, even so innocent.  We were like two kids.  I felt like a teenager again.\n\nAfter that, we started seeing each other whenever possible.  The connection was palpable.  \n\nWe\u2019ve had a lot of great dates and even have started to meet each other\u2019s kids.\n\nThis is about two months into the process.  \n\nGabe was really starting to feel like the guy I have been always wanting: someone sensitive yet masculine, attractive, fun-loving, smart, witty, sweet.  In my mind I had started  to jokingly think of him as my \u201cHallmark Man,\u201d a handsome single man who found me, a lonely single woman in this beautiful quaint town.  Kinda cheesy but everything has just felt so dreamy.\n\nThe way he has talked to me, touched me, and courted me has been so good, honestly amazing.  \n\nSome points of concern started to arise, though\u2026\n\nHe would make these comments that started to make me think he was, at the very least, bisexual.  I am bi, so it really doesn\u2019t bother me, but what did bother me is he would call himself straight but make these joking statements that just made me think his sexuality isn\u2019t what he was making it out to be.\n\nAlso, whenever we have messed around, it seemed to take more effort to get him fully \u201cready to go,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t impossible, just not as easy as it usually is with men.  \n\nAnother yellow flag is my realization that he may be love-bombing me, as the statements he has been making about his feelings for me seem a little excessive and exaggerated.  I thought maybe this guy is just really feeling swept away in it all, you know? \n\nAnd it\u2019s been refreshing, because it\u2019s been hard to find romance.  Most men just seem to want to sleep with me (I have been told that I am very beautiful and have received a lot of sexual interest from men, but harder to find an emotional connection).\n\nLastly, and this is what will lead to the part where things turn into a nightmare, I started to notice that it seemed Gabe was hiding something from me.  I don\u2019t want to go into too much detail (to try to preserve anonymity), but there was a certain situation that concerned me, where Gabe was obfuscating an area of his personal life.  It seemed he was going out of his way to hide this.\n\nThat\u2019s what really started to eat at me.  \n\nYesterday morning, I woke up at 3 AM and couldn\u2019t get back to sleep.  My mind was suddenly focused on this weird feeling.  Something was bothering me about my sweet, romantic Gabe.  Something felt fake or like a lie.  Was I just trying talk myself out of good healthy relationship?  Was I afraid to find real love?  My mind kept circling around the areas that seemed murky.  Was he hiding something?  Something keep feeling weird.  Weird about these little details in conversations.  Weird about how perfect this all seems.  Weird about this sense of something really dark hiding there (I have been in several bad relationships and know that intuitive feeling you get when someone is being deceitful).\n\nSo, I looked up his name online.  What I found absolutely destroyed me, I feel like I can\u2019t breathe even writing this out and thinking about it.  \n\nI found a web article from 2020 with Gabe\u2019s full name about how he was being charged with child molestation of a teen boy.  It had his age, his name, his city.  \n\nI am a mother of teen boys!  \n\nNow, he never told me about this (why would he), but what gets me is I couldn\u2019t find any information on conviction.  He was accused but not convicted.  He still has his kids!  So, is he actually innocent?\n\nI\u2019m scared and confused and heartbroken.  I thought I had finally found a healthy and connected relationship.  I was feeling so hopeful and happy.\n\nI feel like I have only one choice for the safety of my children.  I have to end this!  I have to end what seemed like the best relationship I\u2019ve ever had.\n\nWas I being groomed for access to my kids?  All of this great love and connection seemed so real, so genuine!\n\nI feel stupid and lost and I am paralyzed in fear.  This man has already been in my home!  He knows where my house is!  He\u2019s spent a little time (not alone, thank God) with my kids!\n\nAnd, as far as he knows, we are still good.  But what if he is truly innocent and was falsely accused (since I can\u2019t find record of conviction)?  What do I say to him?  \n\nI feel sick.  This feels like a nightmare.  How can it be real?",

            "comment": "You cannot take the risk.  Your boys come first every time.  Your intuition or subconscious mind saw the red flags which is what woke you up.  You will never know the true story of what happened or didn\u2019t happen.  There will be his side and the teen\u2019s side.  There is no way to know why charges were dropped or not pressed.  Because there was no conviction, it would have been very hard to have his children taken from him.\n\nI would suggest that you need to cool the relationship for two reasons.  1. You cannot afford to be wrong because the well being of your children are at risk.  2. You got into the relationship because you were needing a relationship.  If you need a relationship then you aren\u2019t ready to be independent and walk away from the relationship if there are bad signs.  You were lonely, and held off\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t start a relationship until you are not lonely.  Yea, that sounds crazy.  You need friends and activities and a strong sense of independence and can do attitude.  You need to be skeptical because you got \u201ctaken\u201d by the wrong guy and stayed for 13 years.  You only got out of that last year.  You need to be comfortable and strong being alone.  Only then will you be ready for evaluating relationships when they appear.\n\nSo, tell Gabe that this is all happening too fast for you, that you are not ready to be in such a serious relationship so soon.  Wish him well, and say goodbye.  Then Get some therapy from an experienced trauma therapist and develop some new hobbies and activities where you can meet new people and make friends before you get involved in another relationship.",

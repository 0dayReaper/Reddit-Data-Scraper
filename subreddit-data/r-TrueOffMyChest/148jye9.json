    "postText": "Hi I am a 21 male and I've struggled to lose my virginity and not only that I never understood consent properly so I was afraid I may hurt someone I decided to look up for escorts at first it was great but now I think I am addicted. I usually go for east Asians as they are really friendly and nice to me at all times. But the regret came when I started to sleep with too many different escorts i did end up quitting I believe it wasn't good for me. However i am afraid of getting recognised at work from these escorts I thought it was a safe place and discreet but i was walking and an escort came up to me and asked why I don't visit anymore in a joking away i was embarrassed and I may even quit my job because of it. as i work in a really good and popular retail area Please any advice would be appreciated",

Ask for more discretion from them if you're worried about having to explain to your coworkers. \n\nLike with anything, too much can be a bad thing. It's up to you to decide if it's taking over your life and when to stop / cut down.",

An escort is just a woman with a job, and when she runs into you on the street she will probably ask. And that\u2019s ok, just be cool and it won\u2019t be a big deal. \u201cYeah, I just don\u2019t have as much time anymore, and have been hitting the gym more often instead.  It\u2019s all good!  Hope you\u2019re doing well!\u201d Blah blah blah.\n\nBe well and do what makes you a better person and it will be better in the future.",

I lacked confidence so I just paid for it. It was a great experience. Most of the women I slept with were kind and actually very down to earth. \n\nChange your mindset about why you really think sex workers destroyed your view on sex. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t never really about sex, addictions become addictions because something else is missing in your life. If it wasn\u2019t sex or women, you would\u2019ve turned to another outlet, drugs or otherwise. \n\nThese addictions usually come from a place of loneliness and lack of self control. So ask yourself, why do you feel this way, and how do you overcome it?",

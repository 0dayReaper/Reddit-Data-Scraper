    "postText": "Warning for mentiones of severe animal abuse.\n\nLike it says in the title. He abused me for the entirety of our relationship. He stalks me now that it's over. He hurt my friends. He frequently threatened to kill my friends or me if i did something wrong.\n\nHe found a weird sense of joy in telling me horrible things he's done and watching me react to them. I know because after we broke up i asked him. \nHe says it's fun to watch me struggle to cope with it. \n\nOne of the worst stories was about how he \"played\" with kittens his mom would rescue.\nHe said he'd grab them, move their limbs wrong, bounce them around on his bed, shake them. Most of them died. It was years ago when we dated but it haunts me. \nI still pray for these kittens a lot. I don't know why. Maybe just to make sure they're remembered. Maybe to make sure they're still loved in a way.\nIt wasn't the only thing but it's the one on my mind right now. I can't sleep. I'm nauseous. \nI've been carrying his confession for years now and i needed it out. That's all.",

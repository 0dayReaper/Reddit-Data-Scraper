    "postText": "Fuck all of you, seriously. I'm a poor college student, and I live in an apt with no kitchen, so all I can make are microwavable foods AND ALL YOU FUCKERS BOUGHT IT ALL. No ramen, no canned food, no bread, no produce, frozen food is pretty much gone. Not everyone can afford to stock up and buy the store out when they restock, save some for people trying to get by day by day. There's so little food in the stores for no reason. I also only have 2 rolls of TP left and literally every store I've been to is sold TF out so I'm going to have to shower after every shit. Seriously, you guys need to chill, you're fucking over a lot of people.\n\nEdit: Took a nap and this blew up, thanks to the people who offered to send me supplies, if the situation doesn't change in a few weeks I may take you up on it, but rn I'm sure there are others that could use help more than me.",

Lack of testing means people have to quarantine themselves at even the slightest hint of being ill or being around people who seem ill, even if they don't have Covid 19. The prospect of not being able to go out for two weeks, maybe longer, is causing people to stock up.\n\nIf you're a single person, stocking up isn't that alarming looking. But if you're a family of four, it's going to look like hoarding. Two weeks is 56 breakfasts, 56 lunches, 56 dinners, tons of snacks, etc. That's only two weeks. What if this goes on longer?\n\nOur grocery store cut their hours. They offer curbside, but it's booked out for weeks. They won't test the sick and nobody knows what's going on or what's going to happen.  It's no wonder people are freaking out.",

They're only about a mile cross country from the river so I could easily go fishing. I did the whole homesteading bit out there for a few years, I can shoot a gun, but, I'll admit I'm a bit rusty and need to work on my aim, I know how to hunt and properly butcher the animals I kill. I can cook whole meals over an open fire and took a wilderness survival training course once when I went manic. Not good with gardening, but, my mom and my boyfriend are. They have an artesian well right down the road from them if something went wrong with the creek. I've used cloth toilet paper before and will do it again if it comes down to it. My moral compass doesn't include *not* robbing pharmacies for my very much necessary medications, if need be. I'm also a former meth cook and that shit's like riding a bicycle so I could go back to it if I absolutely had to; I just never *want* to.

Like someone has a ton of milk and bread and it\u2019s just going to go waste rather than someone actually using that food. \n\nThe psychology of stocking up for 2 weeks is not that things will get over. It\u2019s that if you happen to be stuck at home for 2 weeks without access to food, you should be able to eat something.\n\nThe other day, I saw a young couple buy 4 carts worth of food from a target and someone asked him what\u2019s up and the guy said \u201cyea lots of mouths to feed at home\u201d. Even then, no family buys multiple carts worth of food at the same time.\n\nEdit: i will explain the carts comment. A lot of people have commented how common it is for large families of say 6+ buying multiple carts of food on planned shopping trips. Fair enough, I think you\u2019re right. I live in a large city and most of the families are a smaller size. Also, I get if someone shops for monthly groceries at Walmart or Costco. But given the current atmosphere with the pandemic, I thought a young couple buying 4 carts worth of food 2 days back from a target in the city was suspicious.\n\nBut thank you for taking the time with providing the examples from your experiences, I truly appreciate the perspective :) I always lived in a city / small family of 4 and even now it\u2019s just me and my SO.",

First, the hoarding has caused me to work more hours, losing weekends to this nonsense.  I am exhausted.  Secondly, because of the extra work I haven't been able to buy groceries in a decent time frame, so I'm screwed in many ways.  \n\nNow, I do have quite a bit to scream about when it comes to store managers because they are also a factor in what's happened to me.  I have store managers who want me to hang around and fix stuff that MIGHT go wrong.  Not show up because something is broken, but in the event that something does break.  When I tell them no because \"That's not my job.  There are stores that actually need me to fix something right now.  I've been on the clock for 10 hours without anything to eat.  I'm tired because of these extra hours cutting into sleep.\"  all I get told is \"My store comes first, I don't care about your problems.\"  \n\nMost of my anger, however, is directed at the news media.  If they weren't so desperate to make this look like the Black Plague and the end of society, then there wouldn't be all these hoarders, there wouldn't be this panic buying.  As angry as I am towards the hoarders and these store managers, I lay the blame entirely at the main stream news.  They caused this shit.",

    "postText": "So I (18 f) have worked at my job at an icecream place since I was a freshmen in highschool. I do like my job, I like the people and I make pretty good money, but today I just broke down sobbing from how overworked I was. So, the place I work at is understaffed, so despite being part time I work 6 days a week, with 5-7 hour shifts each day. That was already pretty tough for me, but I love my coworkers, and my boss is usually really understanding so I don\u2019t mind the work, but today I just reached my breaking point. My shift was supposed to be 3-9 and we close at 9. Today we were so busy, I literally didn\u2019t even get a chance to look at my phone until 9:40 (also we don\u2019t get breaks). Me and my coworker, despite being scheduled for 3-9, stayed til 9:40 to close down the place, sweep, mop, do dishes, etc. This is normal for us. As me and my coworker were walking out the door at 9:40 I saw that my boss had texted me to restock a cooler before closing, and she sent this at 4. Restocking a cooler takes about an hour to do, we were both exhausted, so I texted my boss apologizing that we couldn\u2019t do it tonight, and that we were so busy that I didn\u2019t see her text, but I could come in tomorrow and restock it if she wants (I was not scheduled to work tomorrow). She immediately blew up at me telling me how disappointed she was in me, and how she expected me to be a better worker than this. I just broke down. I work my ass off for this job, staying past my scheduled shift to work, working 6 days a week because we were understaffed, and really doing my best at my job, and yet all I get is being reprimanded and getting called a bad worker. Everyone around me tells me to quit, but I never will. I\u2019ve been here for too long, and I do like it there, but tonight I just broke.",

You start as you mean to go on - if you don't put your foot down about leaving on time they will continue to take advantage of you. Not sure what the laws are like where you are but in the UK if you work 6 hours or more you are entitled to a 20 minute break.\n\nWhat you're describing is not a life, you're being taken advantage of and if you don't put your foot down it won't change (probably get worse). They're not paying you above minimum wage so why work more than the minimum?",

Working at an icecream place doesn\u2019t sound difficult in theory, but at my place we are on our feet serving people the whole time, and if not that, lifting heavy tubs of icecream, mopping, sweeping doing dishes whatever. I\u2019m always sore and I have back problems because of work. I\u2019m just so exhausted all the time",

Please know that you don\u2019t need to stay in a job like that if it\u2019s too hard on your body! There are so many other employers out there who will actually be good to their employees, it just takes time to find the best fit for you. I hope you can do what\u2019s best for you :)",

After that hosting in restaurants, then waiting tables, then bartending. All together I spent 16 years in the service industry. I understand that it\u2019s hard on your body but it truly only gets harder the older you get unless you can find a way out of labor intensive work which is what I had to do. I got down votes on my last response but I stand by my opinion that you gotta suck it up and deal bc working hard is just part of life unless you\u2019re born rich. I\u2019m still trying to win the lottery.",

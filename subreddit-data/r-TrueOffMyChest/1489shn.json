    "postText": "I'm in my early twenties, had an unfortunate year and have ended up back with parents. \n\nPerfect news right?! Should be able to easily either A) get back on my feet with studies etc and build a new foundation and career  OR B) take this time to pursue luxuries like my own business or creative endeavour to try and turn that into a career (for me, music)\n\nEither way, no rent to pay and mum's got a fridge with groceries. So really it should be FUCKING EASY \n\nBut there's a history of abuse and last time I tried to live with my parents and finish high school I ended up dropping out and moving out to live on minimum wage doing crappy customer service jobs . But somehow this year everything managed to fall apart. \n\nAnd here we are again...my heart is fucking breaking and i'm so disappointed to be here, it never should've happened, i'd always had back up plans and savings and somehow everything that could possibly go wrong has gone wrong, and i'm back living with two crazy people. \n\nI was thinking of going back to college and today there's an open day. But I can't bring myself to. How the fuck will I study or even sleep in peace for the next YEAR?! \n\n(Yelling, shouting, swearing, breaking things...dad used to hit me as a kid, has stopped now. But being around him again has re triggered all the PTSD and anxiety I thought i'd worked past)\n\nHouse is also a shitshow which has triggered my OCD. \n\nAll I can think to do is get ANY job ASAP and save up to move out to some crappy single room non-en-suite houseshare that's gonna eat up \u00a3700 pcm easy in London. Soulless. \n\nJust needed to vent. I'm so jealous of people with functioning families to go to in times of need. \n\nThe worst thing is my mum reels me in in her good moments, talking about supporting me and wishing me well, and the next moment she's picking on me for...well, everything, and chatting like she knows what real happiness is. But she doesn't have a job, hasn't left my dad in decades even when he was abusive and cheated on her, and it's not my bloody place to say anything but honestly it hurts watching her live out every day in this dark depressing house!!! I've become depressed myself!!\n\nMy dad just thinks everyone and everything is rigged inc the government etc. Both of them are just full of pessimism and pretend like they are optimistic (how even!?). \n\nI'M JUST SO JEALOUS OF EVERYONE WITH REASONABLE PARENTS and a HOME to go to. I've got no siblings or extended family either and everything is just so hopelessly toxic it really makes me sad. I should be able to take advantage of staying here rent free but i'm going mad.",

But all I could find were shoeboxes with shared bathrooms and I left the list to come to my parent's house thinking and falling for my parents' fake words and false attitudes. I can't get back on the list now, i'm ineligible, and even if I try applying you literally have to jump through hoops and prove you have nowhere safe to go. I'm not being physically assaulted right now so it's considered safe.",

You can avoid interacting with them. Sorry to say this but you gotta treat it like a hotel somehow to keep your sanity. Maybe if you feel up for it, take them out once in a while to show some appreciation. Maybe they will change their attitude toward you. If not, then again, treat it like it\u2019s just your sleeping place and keep hustling until you can get out. I am 100% for you to pursue your dreams but you gotta make sure you can survive first.",

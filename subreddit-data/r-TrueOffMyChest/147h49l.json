Why do people act like they don\u2019t get angry? Why is that such a flex? That doesn\u2019t exist with any other emotion. There\u2019s sooo many reasons to get angry and I hate that I can never express them because half the world pretends they \u201cdon\u2019t get angry\u201d and that\u2019s so annoying to me. It dismisses people who actually admit to getting angry. Like right now I\u2019m upset about something and I feel so less than so I don\u2019t want to talk about it with anyone. Can people really just bypass a whole emotion?",

Is it spontaneous or is it always at the boiling point waiting to go?\n2. How long does it take for you to think 'Sheeesh, I was being unreasonable'? Do you think that at all?\n3. If every action has equal and opposite reaction (it does) what are other people reactions to you? Are these outbursts public or not?\n\nYou can make up more points to suit every aspect of anger you want to manage. Take your time and baby steps. Ofc this was done with a professional and not by me alone, I would highly advise looking into it if your financial situation allows",

It sucked because I threw away something that was good at the time just by being angry at negligible things. \n\nNow at almost 30, I rarely get mad, and when I do, I just breathe and think back to how anger has made my life harder over the years, breathe a bit, then I'll calm down. If I was the same person as I was 4 or 5 years ago, my current girlfriend wouldn't be with me, and to be fair, I'm currently with the woman of my dreams. A learning lesson that turned into a big blessing in the end. You've got this my guy. Hopefully you learn to control it sooner than later.",

Or *maybe* cry because I kinda liked my coat without the coffee stains. Getting mad is just so far down on that list that I don't get around to it much (and that's the way I like it).",

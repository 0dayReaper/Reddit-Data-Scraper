The Soviet Union did a terrible job of developing infrastructure, and Ukraine was worse than most. Russia has bullied Ukraine for 100 years. The train system is the best way to move from Eastern Ukraine to Western Ukraine, but typically that is one train per day to get from any western region to Kiev(not Kyiv, that is the Russian name for Kiev) then from Kiev the following day you can take a train to L\u2019viv. It is nearly impossible to drive across Ukraine. Most Ukrainians don\u2019t have vehicles anyway. Fleeing this the Russian Invasion is very difficult for the average citizen of Ukraine.",

The shelters are usually underground or in the basement level. In the case of apartment buildings the shelter entrance is inside the building so I don't think they are any more likely to be targeted or attacked. I'm curious now what shelters are like in other countries.",

This is the *universal* opinion of every military analyst I've read/heard. Google it yourself. Show her the articles/videos. Ukraine simply lacks the numbers, especially in terms of aircraft. Bravery and skill don't matter in the face of overwhelming numbers. Russia will immediately win air superiority, and from there it is impossible for your ground forces to hold.  Everyone agrees Russia will easily overcome Ukraine's defenses, but will then have a very long and difficult occupation (much like Afghanistan). \n\n\n\n\nRegardless, the initial invasion will kill thousands of civilians due to the Russian military's use of indiscriminate shelling/bombing tactics. Don't let you and your family be part of that death statistic.\n\nYou need to *strongly* consider getting out of the country if Putin signals he'll be going beyond the Donbass region. We don't know how far he'll try to go, but if you wait to leave until his forces actually push to Odessa (which they could do with very little warning because of amphibious assault capabilities from the Black Sea) it's going to be very dangerous.\n\n**Edit: Russia has just started shelling Odessa. Stay safe OP.**\n\n**Edit 2:** All the military analysts were wrong. The Russian military is a joke. You absolutely love to see it.",

A great Russia once existed, of which Ukraine was but a part. The bad communists, like [Bolshevik leader Vladimir] Lenin and [Soviet leader Nikita] Khrushchev and their successor Mikhail Gorbachev, divided up that great Russia in an artificial way, creating divisions where none existed before. Implicit in this is that Ukrainians who say differently are deluded or manipulated by others. Now, that natural vision has to be restored by a strong leader, walking in the footsteps of Stalin.\n\nSee the latest Putin speech and read it carefully, happened couple hours ago.",

Ukraine existed in the Soviet Union as the Ukrainian SSR, but before that it was considered a part of Russia, and before that it was this kind of frontier space between Poland, Russia and the Ottoman Empire.  Russian nationalists tend to say that Ukraine isn't a legitimate country and that they should just take back all of that land.  Ukrainians tend to disagree, especially after events like Holodomer in WWII where the Soviet Union intentionally diverted food away from Ukraine during a famine, killing millions.\n\nThe capital of Ukraine is Kyiv, also known as Kiev, and is HUGELY important to Russian national mythology as the capital of the first Russian state (called Kievan Rus.)  Ukraine also has this incredibly rich soil called 'black earth' and it will be somewhat insulated form climate change by its inland climate.  IMO this is a long play by Putin to control Europe's food supply in the future.",

It might help keep the glass secure, I learnt about it a few years ago when I was learning about things like hurricane safety in school. \n\nI don't know if it works against bombs or anything but hopefully it does. I will pray for you and your family to be safe.",

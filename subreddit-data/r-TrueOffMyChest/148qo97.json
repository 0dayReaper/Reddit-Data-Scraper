    "postText": "My SIL (16F) is moving out and in with her boyfriend\u2019s grandma. I literally cannot understand how the hell her parents are so okay with it! She\u2019s literally moving out because she hates my in-laws! She changed school districts and everything! My parents would\u2019ve dragged my ass back home if I even spoke about doing something like that. Her mom moved to ontario from Alberta because she didn\u2019t like her own mother so maybe she gets it?? But where\u2019s the discipline at? I get relaxed parenting and her being 16 but really..?\n\nI thought I was as mature as an adult at 16, which I was more mature than my friends but still. I was an idiot at that age and I\u2019m glad my parents stopped me from doing most of the things that I wanted to do. \n\nI don\u2019t even know man\u2026 I\u2019m culturally and religiously not as white as they are (I\u2019m Muslim but I look white) so maybe that\u2019s why I don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever understand it. Yes I hated my parents at that age and wanted to move out, I\u2019m also glad I didn\u2019t and grew tf up.\n\nI\u2019m glad my partner is a little better and shares the same values as me, but I guess this is what I get for having a thing for rednecks.",

Some parents don\u2019t know how to navigate that unfortunately. There\u2019s no way in hell that my parents wouldn\u2019t have allowed this and I\u2019m white lol. Idk what my momma would have done if I tried to do stuff like that, but I was smart enough to not ever find out because she put the fear of God in me annnnnnnnnd so glad that she did because I was a hot mess express growing up hahaha.

I talked with a coworker who\u2019s in his 30\u2019s now but he moved out at 16 and says he wishes he didn\u2019t because he\u2019s really behind in life. I have a good feeling she\u2019s gonna regret this but I wish my in laws parented a little better. She\u2019s the 3rd child and my partner was a handful growing up so I can get how draining it is to have one more.",

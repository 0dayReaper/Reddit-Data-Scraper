I don\u2019t like talking about the fact that I\u2019m a 31 year old married woman with 2 babies and live with my mother. I hate not having my own house. I\u2019m honestly ashamed of our situation, although many have told me there\u2019s no reason to be. When we found out I was pregnant with twins, my mom genuinely wanted to help us. We wanted to buy a house after renting for so many years, but in this economy it just wasn\u2019t happening for us. I had to give up my full-time job to be a SAHM because childcare costs would take up my entire salary. I\u2019d basically be working to pay for daycare, so the best option was for me to quit my job to raise the twins. My mom helped us by moving us in and wanted to be a 3rd set of hands to help with the babies. I\u2019m just frustrated. We have ZERO privacy and living here is destroying our marriage. I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like for us to be a family of 4. I see no light at the end of the tunnel and no getting out of here any time soon. With just 1 income and the cost of living going up, it feels impossible. I\u2019m so depressed and I\u2019m miserable. I cry all the time. I try to be the best mother I can be despite the circumstances. I\u2019m grateful for help, but I just want my own space again.",

It gets better. You're being a great parent by giving your children the best possible life by saving money and having your mom able to help you.\n\nAlso, I am like you as well where there is no more light at the end of the tunnel in regards to having my own house. Sure we could have an apartment but our lifestyle wouldn't be half as great as it is now.\n\nWe just got back from a cruise, a mountain vacation and now we're going to Las Vegas in a few weeks then the kids will be traveling internationally in a few months. I don't say that to brag but I'm saying that those things wouldn't be possible without living with my parents.\n\nSo instead of looking at all the downsides try to focus on how much money you're saving and that your quality of life is better for it.\n\n(I'm Asian btw and my parents actually wanted me to move back home so they could be closer to my kids.

My guess she loves having you there, specially the grandkids. \n\nInstead of overthinking this situation, think about solutions. See if your mum can take care of the kids for a few hours so you can work part-time. Somewhere close to home. Depending on your profession, if you can work weekends or from home.\n\nMake sure to take care of your husband and don't neglect him (also the other way around), that would kill the marriage.

The only reason we could afford the house we got (beautiful view, four bedrooms, 3-1/2 bathrooms, double lot for ~$50,000 in 2015) is because it was in absolute shit condition.  \n\nLike, built in (we think) 1906, college student rental for god knows how long, \u201cfoundation\u201d of some rando additions rotting into the ground, four layers of roofing (metal, then 3-tab, then extremely old textured asphalt shingles, &amp;, finally, cedar shake shingles), layers of siding removed &amp; replaced, knob &amp; tube wiring mixed with rando poorly done wiring (x2 hot wires going to one light \ud83d\ude2c), an entire plumbing system that had to be completely torn out &amp; replaced, flooring torn up &amp; replaced, heating system torn out &amp; replaced (think giant radiators), all windows &amp; doors replaced, etc.  \n\nFor a while we had no living room cause the winter came before we could seal in that section of the house after redoing the \u201cfoundation\u201d on the addition that was poorly put in at some point.  When we were replacing the roof, we wound up bailing out &gt;55gals of rain water out of our house at 2am cause we couldn\u2019t finish it before the rain came in.  Then, we had to leave at 5am because we had to install a bunch of stoves for a job.\n\nWe\u2019re contractors &amp; it\u2019s the only way we were able to \u201cafford\u201d our house.  I can\u2019t do construction anymore cause my pregnancies nearly killed me &amp; destroyed my body for trades work.  \n\nLet me just put it this way, if you have to basically spend 5+yrs rebuilding a house yourself just to afford a house (mind you, we didn\u2019t have kids either when we started in 2015), you aren\u2019t the problem.  You haven\u2019t failed.  Capitalism, the \u201cfree market\u201d, &amp; rampant wealth inequality has dogged us all &amp; made living in the US impossible without giving everything of yourself just to make ends meet.  Give yourself a break.  Do what you\u2019re able to oppose the bullshit system.  But, don\u2019t blame yourself\u2026. You\u2019re surviving &amp; have a place to live. That\u2019s amazing.",

How about date nights with your husband? \n\nIt\u2019s so funny to me when people are embarrassed or ashamed of still living with their parents. In some countries it\u2019s perfectly normal and expected to have a few generations living under one roof, others consider themselves failures if they\u2019re not out by 18. In this global economy, don\u2019t feel ashamed. There\u2019s nothing wrong with having family help you out. \n\nTwins are hard. Twice the trouble, twice the work, double the difficulty in balancing being a parent with being a person. Try and schedule some time every week for you, and give the same to your husband and mother. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not the only one drowning in that house, and you\u2019re allowed to talk about it. You\u2019re allowed to ask for space, time, decompression and to discuss how you can all work to maintain your sanity in this situation. \n\nThis is not forever, even if it feels like it.

She may be able to offer some suggestions for medication and therapy. \nOnce you feel a little better, think of small steps toward your ultimate goals. Would marriage counseling help? Date nights? Finding a way to carve out some privacy in the house? Can you talk with your mom about this?\nIf you feel ready to work, do you have the necessary skills and training? If not, maybe begin by talking with a counselor at a local community college (or, the equivalent if you are not in the US)? Might help to know what\u2019s out there and available. Once you start working, you and your husband should split child care proportionally- not just out of your check. I\u2019ve know many women who\u2019ve unfortunately said the same thing- their whole salary really goes to daycare, even if spouses both contribute, but they still work so they have some independence and autonomy, retirement savings, etc.- not saying you should not be a SAHM- just saying you have some choices.\nBut first- take care of your emotional and mental health and well-being.

We have been conditioned to think that living with our parents as adults should be shameful by a system that benefits from having kids move out of their parent\u2019s home as soon as possible. The sooner you leave your parent\u2019s home, the sooner you\u2019ll need to buy a house (mortgage), go to college (student loan), pay for necessities with money you don\u2019t have (credit cards), pay for a means to get to and from your job (car loan), the list goes on\u2026\n\nThe more kids leave their parent\u2019s homes the more \u201cthey\u201d can make in the lifetime of those young people.

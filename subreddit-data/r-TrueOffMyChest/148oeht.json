    "postText": "My daughter breaks my heart sometimes.\n\nI don't know how else to say it. \n\nShe's the light of my life and I love her more than words can possibly express. \n\nShe's been diagnosed as autistic, not sure which level yet but she's non verbal and has meltdowns often. I was diagnosed as autistic as an adult as well. Husband is neurotypical and supportive. \n\nMy daughter is super spicy and full of chutzpah, but sometimes she really makes me sad.\n\nFor her.\nFor me.\n\nThe other day we took her outside to the street (we live on the dead end of a dead-end street where all the kids come and play) and there was some kids my daughters age for once. (She'll be 3 on my birthday.)\n So I got the big idea into my idiotic brain that she'd finally have some kids to play with! She has a 2 yr old brother who's as autistic as her and a neurotypical brother who's 10. \n\nSo I brought her out and all the little ones were so excited to meet a new friend!! They didn't crowd her but were very sweet and welcoming, and she screamed.\nShe just freaked the heck out and ran away, clinging to our gate and sobbing and begging to be let in like some starved little orphan.\nShe's got lungs on her, just trust me on that. She scared all the other kids, who got sad because she \"hated them\" and so I had to kidsplain to them what was really going on for her and why she reacted like that. They understood eventually but once I'd had a minute to myself after calming her down, I was startled by the fact that I found myself really hurting. I actually cried, and I never cry!\n\nWe have her in EI, and we work with her every day and I know her on a deeper than average level which helps me to help her.\n\nBut as thankful as I am for her, some days I feel robbed, for the both of us.\n\nThere. I said it.\nCall me heartless if you must.\n\nWill this ever hurt less?",

He happens to be my favorite person on the face of the planet. We get each other. He is one of the best kids I\u2019ve ever met. I maybe a little bias.\n\nWe spend a lot of time together. I know what he needs, triggers him, and what makes him feel comfortable.\n\nI\u2019d like to say as a parent you are doing a great job! You child may have meltdowns in certain situations but that doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t try. Just have an evacuation plan.\n\nYou cannot control the behavior but you can adapt. It\u2019s hard and it sucks but it\u2019s always worth it to try.\n\nAs far as other children and parents, you will be judged no matter what! Please don\u2019t let that bother you. \n\nSometimes my nephew struggles with making friends (he is getting better now) but his parents are sensitive to the fact that sometimes he is excluded because his cousins/friends are not interested in what he is into. I think it hurts their feelings more than his because he just continues with his play.\n\nHang in there. You will be fine. It is great that you are aware but just keep in mind even though in this day in age people will still give you the side eye.\n\n\ud83d\udc9c",

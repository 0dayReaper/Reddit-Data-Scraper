It\u2019s been a thing I\u2019ve had since I was around 12-13 and I have no idea why.\n\nI spend a considerable amount of time every day of my life thinking of girl\u2019s armpits, they just drive me crazy. \n\nIt\u2019s my biggest secret and I can\u2019t help but feel weird for it. In every other aspect of my life I\u2019m just a completely normal guy. I have friends, a job, I\u2019m sociable, I dress good and put effort into myself. It\u2019s just this one thing that makes me feel like a weirdo.",

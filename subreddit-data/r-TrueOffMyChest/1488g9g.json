    "postText": "I am allergic to eggs. Eggs are in almost every bakery product, dessert and breakfast. People forget about egg allergies because they aren't as common or notable as a peanut allergy. \n \nEvery holiday i suffer because someone fails to mention they put eggs in something and my parents say something like \"oh this shouldn't have eggs, this usually doesn't have eggs\" BUT IT DOES. EVERY HOLIDAY WITHOUT FAIL. Also I am half hispanic and half asian so allergies are not very known in these communities. \n\nMy allergic reaction is so awful I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I get a horrible, horrible stomach ache. It lasts for days and it's hard to eat anything. I actually faint in pain sometimes. My throat swells up and my skin gets hives. Also this is a common occurrence. I have an epipen and everything but my parents only use it in \"emergencies\". I AM IN PAIN AND CANNOT GET UP FOR DAYS.\n\nI really just want to eat a cookie and I'm not hunched over the toilet for days.\n\n I want to live without the constant fear of a horrible stomach ache that lasts for days.",

Here it\u2019s pretty commend now and if you buy cookies and stuff from the shelf in the supermarket they are labelled as vegan. \n\n\nYou should really stop just eating things without knowing what\u2019s inside. That\u2019s commend for people with food allergies, they only eat what they made/ seen how it\u2019s made or in restaurants/ bakery\u2019s which knows how exactly stuff is made. \n\n\nIt\u2019s your food Allergie, no one else your old enough to write here your old enough to keep an eye on it. \n\n\nFamily should know of corse but they are humans and don\u2019t have this, so they forget about how bad it is. Search for vegan bakery\u2019s and get your deserved egg free cookie and cake :D",

Find a dessert you like and buy/make it either single serving or sharing. \n\nDairy allergies are the same. Everyone sends to think \"oh its no big deal, all you'll get is an upset tunmy.\" No Susan, it's a bit fucking more than that. \n\nEven with more known allergies, you really have to take things into your own hands. Don't depend on other prime. And if they bitch about you not eating their food, be like, \"well i can't depend on you not to food-murder me out of ignoance, but damn, that freaking egg custard looks amazing. I'll just admire it from a safe distance with my carrot sticks.\"",

            "comment": " Damn, that really sucks. I\u2019m sorry. \n\nGotta start making your own food. Learn how to cook things with out eggs. Make your parents buy you all the necessary ingredients. And then try to only eat food that you know is safe. Seeing how big veganism is, I\u2019m sure there are eggless cookies you can make, along with pretty much any other meal. \n\nIt still sucks and obviously sometimes you\u2019re gonna have to roll the dice and eat other people\u2019s food. But if I were you I\u2019d try to minimize that as much as freaking possible. You\u2019re gonna be dealing with this the rest of your life. Rather than live in fear I\u2019d take control of my diet and that way you KNOW you won\u2019t be accidentally eating any eggs, as long as you\u2019re eating food you\u2019ve prepared yourself.",

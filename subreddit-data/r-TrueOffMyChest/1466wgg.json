    "postText": "So the title basically says it all. My husband and I have been together 10 years married for 6. The sex has gotten boring to say the least. We went from having sex every day to once maybe twice a month. I\u2019ve brought it up to him because I told him I missed it. He brushed it off and told me he \u201cfelt comfortable\u201d so he didn\u2019t really think to put in any effort. That made me sad but l expressed how I felt and put it out there. Nothing changed. Still very infrequent. Regardless, I was watching a tik tok the other day and the woman was talking about how a man has never made her cum. I thought it was absurd but it had me thinking about us having sex. Has he ever made me cum if I\u2019m doing the work? It\u2019s pitiful honestly. He initiates it because I stopped since I was turned down so many times. the initiation is most likely him asking me to give him a blowjob. There\u2019s not really any touching. Or kissing. Which I miss. It\u2019s usually me giving a bj til I feel like getting on top. I usually do all the work. Sometimes I can get off, other times he nuts so fast i don\u2019t have a chance to. And if he does, I have to get off of him. There\u2019s no making sure I cum too, no foreplay, and it\u2019s been like this for as long as I can remember. I don\u2019t really even remember when he took his time to take care of my needs. I see what the tik toker was talking about. I\u2019m having a bit of a meltdown bc he thinks there\u2019s nothing wrong but I am sexually frustrated every single day. But I also feel like my nagging would turn him off from trying as well.  My husband is the only man I\u2019ve been with so I don\u2019t know if this is normal or what.",

Quick bj and then a quick ride and we are done before we get caught in the car sex. \nYou need to take a weekend away together with no plans but to spend time together in a room and walks, make sure it has a hot tub you both can be in together, no tv unless porn. \nBring ideas of things to try with you. Maybe silk gloves to use on each other, stop and get a riding crop from a farm style store if interested in light bdsm, lube for sure, sexy outfit for going out and maybe a dress and no panties, of course a hot mighty, bring toys for both of you. C*ck ring for him definitely so you give him bj and slide it on as he grows a bit and it stops him from cumming. \nFind different stories/video clips that turn you on and can share for ideas. https://asstr.xyz/~Kristen/ have very hot stories. \nOne thing maybe to do early on is to masturbate slowly in front of each other so you both can see what gets each other off. \nThere is also something called delayed satisfaction. So both get close to cumming and stop and maybe read a story, talk about bdsm, eat a snack then start again. Not only will it be explosive when it happens it usually makes the other willing to do whatever to get to cum. \nI mentioned bj earlier make  sure that is only AFTER lots of touching, tasting and foreplay. Then when you DO start to go down on him turn into a 69 position not necessarily doing that but sit on his hand so as he pleasures you, you give pleasure in return. If he stops you stop. \nHave food delivered and pack things like fruit already cut up, cheese cut up, crackers, easy snack things because you will need energy. Avoid too much alcohol as that can make it hard to get hard. \nSorry for sex manual but good luck.. we all need to be taught what we like!!",

My wife and i have been married for 23 years now and we went through a few sexual slumps in this time, and we both realized we needed to try different things, so we researched and found most of your suggestions and it made all the difference in the world. Sexual communication is the key, we are not mind readers and sometimes we all need a bit of direction in the bedroom. But we tried pretty much all of your suggestions and actually incorporate some if not all of those awesome things in our current sex life. The only thing i see being a problem is OP's husband seems a bit on the lazy side of sex, and from what my wife and i have read is that is common, especially in guys that are getting older. Hopefully OP takes some if not all of your suggestions and i hope her husband jumps on board, because sex is a gift and its meant to be fun and exciting.",

Amazing sex is definitely a great thing. I think her husband knows this is what he needs to get off and all is good. But k hope with opening new doorways it will take them on a new journey. \nI forgot to add definitely bring a mask (or cloth or bandanna to make a mask). The touch is heightened to such a degree when you don\u2019t know what they are going to do next. Maybe extra ones to tie hands together. Ice is fun as is a feather. So many ordinary things can bring new sensations.",

But I also feel like my nagging would turn him off from trying as well\n\nHave you seen the other tiktoks currently discussing the topic of how a lot of men \"never see it coming\" when their wives initiate a divorce, because they just labeled the current amount of unhappiness their wives were in as 'acceptable' because no consequences ever came of their behaviour after their wives communicated their needs and feelings to them and the men therefore thought she would never leave? If not, start letting it have consequences that you're not happy in your marriage. \n\nWhy is he the only one who gets to be comfortable? Of course he's comfortable! He's got bj's and sex on demand, and he doesn't even have to put any effort in. I've been with men who act the same as your husband does, and after talking to other girl friends who have similar experiences, I realised that men like that are only using women as sex toys they can 'jerk off' into without having to actually do any of the mutual shit that *actual* sex involves. I'm **not** calling you a sex toy and I'm not blaming you for doing things on his demands for a long time, but nothing is going to happen if you don't make it clear that you are *not* a sex toy but a **wife**. \n\nMy advice would be to stop giving bj's when he asks. Try to talk to him again, no its not \"nagging\" just because of his selfish attitude towards your shared problem. See how the talk goes along with not giving out, and remember that this is more than just a valid reason to leave him, if you choose to. I'm not saying you should, but you shouldn't feel trapped in a relationship where your partner doesn't even try to make sure you're enjoying it when you're intimate (which btw, does he know it can hurt women to not be wet before sex? Is he under the assumption that \"letting\" you suck his dick is all you need to be ready for sex and that he therefore doesn't have to do anything to ensure that you're comfortable too?).",

It was never going to change if I stayed with him as he didn't see any point in making sure I had a good time as well as him.

Does he have any issues that need to be addressed or that he's hiding from you?\n\nWhy is he so bloody selfish?

I'd begin by seeing if he's willing to meet with a therapist and do a little marriage counseling. This isn't about sex though I'm sure it seems like it. Something else is going on.  There may be some medical issue affecting your husband that has caused his loss and f interest in sex. It might be a good idea to get his testosterone levels checked. \nThe other part is that you say he's never made you orgasm. That has to be something you deal with separately. At some point you have to ask yourself if this is the relationship you want to grow old in. While orgasm is wonderful it's not the reason we marry someone. That's to have life partner.

We\u2019re very happy and contented. What\u2019s your problem?\u201d.\n\nThen one day she had a meltdown and completely lost it with me. \u201cWe need to fix this or we\u2019ll be having a very different sort of conversation!\u201d. Up until this point I hadn\u2019t realised how serious this was for her bc I wasn\u2019t feeling horny ever so I guess I couldn\u2019t empathise with how she was feeling. \n\nAnyway, I spoke to my therapist about it (already had one), and got my hormones checked (I\u2019m also a lady by the way). Everything was normal. Realised it was a performance anxiety thing and also just a lack of effort. \n\nI addressed it and now we\u2019re really good!! \n\nYou need to let your husband know this is really important to you. Then decide what to do based off his actions. Relationships are constant effort! Each person is making an effort all the time. They are hard work. But if both people put in effort they can be fun and fulfilling!!! \n\nYour husband sounds typical for a husband, and that\u2019s why women are divorcing in the hundreds!!",

Maybe let him read this post? Have a heart to heart. If nothing changes, buy a dildo and use it right in front of him.

What things made you guys fall in love with each other and do you still show love to each other? Like, do you still flirt with each other, do you still make efforts for each other to show that kind of love? Or...has the love kind of died?\n\nNow, that isn't to say that because the love is dead that you should split up or divorce him. Honestly, it takes a rekindling of that love to keep loving each other. All those happy couples out there that last a long time? It's because they talk to each other and make their needs known. \n\nI'd sit down and write down how you feel, what you want, and for sex find out the things that you like (foreplay, kissing, rubbing, touching particular places, whispering, biting, etc.). Be able to reflect on what made you fall in love with him, and what you value in your relationship. I'd also take a look at the different love languages that exist and figure out if you're meeting each other's needs. (seriously recc seeing a therapist about any of this too, even an indiv. therapist). \n\nWhen you're able to (without blaming him) express that your needs aren't being met and that you feel unloved and want to sit down and check in with him, I'd do so.\n\nYou could also go here -&gt; [https://www.2bebetter.co/downloads](https://www.2bebetter.co/downloads) and check out their \"check-in\" PDF. Make sure your husband is really in for a sit down though, and is really focused on you and your relationship. \n\nIt is normal to reach a point where you feel like you're not talking to each other, and be able to *recognize* that that's happening. It's not okay to not do anything about it because that's when all the little things build up.",

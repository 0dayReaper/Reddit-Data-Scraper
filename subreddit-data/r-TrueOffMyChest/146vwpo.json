    "postText": "I work for one of the busiest and largest hospitals in the South Puget Sound region Washington. South of Tacoma is all I'll say. It was \"caregiver appreciation week\" last week and every day had a theme. Well, Thursday's theme was \"dress like a Superhero day.\" We do procedures so none of us could do that, we just wore scrubs. But all of our managers at the hospital wore hospital scrubs that day, signifying that we were \"superheroes.\" I've never been more annoyed at managers in my life. We are criminally under paid compared to hospitals up north. We have shitty equipment that is constantly breaking. \n\nIt felt so hypocritical and out of touch with how every day is a struggle here.",

Those are the ones that make the biggest point to bring in some shitty cookies and yell happy nurse appreciation! As if that absolves them of their behaviour the other 51 weeks of the year. \n\nIt's incredibly insulting and I usually wonder in the back of my mind if the cookies are poisoned.\n\nYou know how we really feel appreciated? It's the patients and families that are happy to see you when you come back to work after a stretch off, that are clearly comfortable asking you questions and want to listen to what you have to say and add their input. It's the managers and administrators that try to figure out how to meet goals and expectations within the limitations of reality instead of some fantasy world of policy, procedure, and academic best practice.\n\nAnd it's definitely not the ceo who suddenly shows up in the middle of covid to serve food as a fucking photo op to show support for the frontline while sending junk mail lauding us as heroes with one face while cutting costs with the other face in the middle of a pandemic.",

And like any job that anybody does, there will be parts that bring you great fulfilment and joy, and other parts that bring you great rage and frustration.\n\nI suspect the downvotes are from the bluntness. I think most healthcare workers who aren't super green know exactly what it means when people say stop caring, and that it doesn't mean don't do a good job and don't care about outcomes. While it certainly can mean you've experienced absolute compassion fatigue and burnout, it can also just mean you need to be less emotionally invested in every single aspect of your work.\n\nImpossible patient or family that won't collaborate? Do the tasks you need to do and do your due diligence, but don't invest too much to try to change people's minds if they're not interested, and then cover your butt. Absurd policy change? Raise your concerns, take what works, leave what's impossible, do your best to practice what you know is safe for you and safe for your job, and save the receipts by keeping concerns documented in emails.\n\nIf you can't find that balance where you're able to let go of the garbage and instead invest your energy and emotion in the parts of your work where you can actually make a difference and feel fulfilled, then you need a change in scenery. And that goes for all jobs.",

    "postText": "My husband (25M) and I (24F) have been together for nearly 5 years. I\u2019m not an American citizen and I came here alone a few years ago for college and I met my husband during that time. I was proud of our relationship as he was caring and loving towards me. We had a few fights here and there but we also talked it out and said sorry. His family was welcoming and they loved me so I got nothing to complain about.\n\nI was the bread winner of the relationship but I got laid off last year and lost my legal status to stay in the US. I couldn\u2019t find a new job in time and my husband married to get a green card so I could stay here. The green card is in the process of being reviewed so I can\u2019t legally get a job right now or leave the country (well I could but it\u2019ll be very difficult to get back in). My husband didn\u2019t have a job when I was still working because he was still in school but I begged him to get one after I lost mine and since he still has credit bill to pay. He did get a job but I\u2019m still paying rent and other things out of my own savings until I get the GC. He occasionally would transfer some money in to help out so in my eyes, he was a great husband, until an hour ago.\n\nI woke up early and I knew he had to work today but he was still asleep so I let him and open his phone (he has given me his phone before and let me know the password, he even offered to have my faceID on it for easy access) to look at his schedule so I could wash the right clothes if they were dirty. I thought his schedule went through on an app so I looked for it on home screen. I didn\u2019t see anything so I checked the app library instead (on iPhone, all apps are stored in library, if you want to hide it from plain sight, remove it from home screen). And that was when I saw Grindr app on his phone. I knew what it is and my heart dropped. I opened the app, hoping it to be a joke, like hoping he didn\u2019t have an account or maybe he just downloaded it out of curiosity but no. He has an account and he has talked to several people. They talked about meeting up and all the vulgar stuff, I saw a d***pic from some guy and hosting something from another girl. There were boob pics and others on his explore page and it instantly triggered my body insecurities. I\u2019m too small for my age and my chest isn\u2019t that big, I\u2019m very well aware of this and have those insecurities for years, he knows this too. We\u2019ve talked about our sex life and I\u2019ve tried to meet his needs since his sex drive is much higher than mine but I guess that wasn\u2019t enough. I scrolled down and saw some conversations dated back a month ago. I don\u2019t know how long he has been doing because I was too disgusted, too mortified to look. I\u2019ve seen posts on here about their significant others doing this and never in a million years would I think my own husband would do this. I couldn\u2019t stand it and I woke him up, asking what this was about and he said it was for when he jacked off. I asked if he even wanted this marriage, he said yes he loved me. I asked if he had been cheating on me, he said no. I asked if he had been meeting these people, he said he had no intention to since it was only for jacking off. I honestly couldn\u2019t take in a word he said. I don\u2019t think I believe a word out of his mouth. I don\u2019t know who I married and what else he has been hiding from me. I felt shocked and suffocated staying in the same space as him. He tried to talk to me but I couldn\u2019t handle anything right now. I couldn\u2019t do anything beside crying my eyes out. There is no one I can talk to. My mom is on the other side of the world and she\u2019d worry sick if she knows. My sister would tell me to leave him but it\u2019s not that simple, especially with the GC situation. I can\u2019t talk to his mom even tho we\u2019re quite close because it\u2019ll break her heart and she\u2019s on vacation too. So I\u2019m stuck in this dilemma, I feel sick in my stomach but there is nothing I can do. I\u2019m very stressed out with GC situation and I\u2019m not sure if I can cope with everything going on.",

When your husband is at work, perhaps leave your home and take a walk-you need some breathing space. \n\nWalk to a park or get a coffee down the street. Sit and people watch-just breathe &amp; try to relax. This is easier said than done, but try to turn off your brain and those millions of thoughts running through it. Breathe. \n\nWhen you are ready, think about what you want and what you want to tell your husband. Write it down if that helps. \n\nTalk to your husband when you are able. Good luck OP-internet hugs.",

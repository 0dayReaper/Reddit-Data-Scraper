    "postText": "It\u2019s been over a year. We only knew each other a few weeks. She was everything I had ever wanted. Evidently, the feeling was not mutual. How do I move on? I feel guilty for still thinking about her all this time later but the truth is I never stopped. I haven\u2019t been able to find anyone else in this time since, she moved on almost immediately. I\u2019m happy she\u2019s happy and I totally get that the feelings weren\u2019t mutual and that\u2019s ok and that happens all the time, hell I\u2019ve been on the other end of it. \n\nI just don\u2019t know what I\u2019m supposed to do. I\u2019m effectively haunted by her and it\u2019s made my life harder every damn day. The fact of the matter is that those few weeks were the happiest of my life thus far. For those few weeks I felt content with everything I\u2019d done and the uncertainty of what lie ahead of me. That\u2019s been gone for over a year and I still think about a girl who probably doesn\u2019t even remember the sound of my voice.\n\nHow do you get over someone you never actually had?",

You\u2019re fantasizing. You\u2019re obsessing. And that\u2019s appearing to me as not wanting to let go rather than longing for what never was. \n\nI recommend you get a hobby. Or maybe hit the gym. Make a life style change that will actively give you purpose and contains your focus. I promise in due time that choice will put you around the woman that will reciprocate your feelings. Best of luck.",

I\u2019m a step ahead of ya on the whole gym thing, have lost 60lbs and changed my body this past year. The weight of my memories and fantasies remain though. I suppose all I can do is hope you\u2019re right about that last part.",

Kudos to your weight loss but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ve committed your brain and heart to a brighter place internally. It\u2019s only when we are building safe spaces and new memories that we do not have to harbor old ones internally like some dim flame we are desperately hoping stays lit. Trust me friend, you have the potential to burn bright. I personally do not have OCD but have my own respective challenges I\u2019m working through, but imo any moments of harboring the past represent a lack of focus on the future. Set a goal. An optimistic goal.",

The human brain is so weird and we can dwell on something that others find so insignificant, but it doesn\u2019t feel like that to you. Taking the first step by noticing these feelings and how unhealthy they have become is a sign of growth. \n\nI promise it\u2019s nothing more than a fantasy because not one single person on this planet is perfect. Knowing someone for a few weeks or even a few months isn\u2019t enough to truly see them. I guarantee you that the girl in your mind is only 10% of the real her. She\u2019s an enigma to you and you can\u2019t help but think about what could have been. \n\nI\u2019m not sure how old you are, but when I was a young teen I had an obsession with a couple guys that I only knew for a few weeks. They\u2019d be on my mind constantly for months but they already forgot about me. Eventually I let it go and now I\u2019m able to see what is reality vs what is a dream. I\u2019ve had 3 partners and they all started out as perfect guys who I would fantasize over. As months went by I saw their flaws and that only made me love them even more. \n\nWithout the flaws she doesn\u2019t exist and having this perfect person molded in your mind would actually be very boring in reality. It\u2019s not worth thinking about it anymore because if your fantasy became a reality I 100% guarantee that you will find the relationship bland. The first couple months you have a crush on someone you feel so alive and you get these butterflies and goosebumps thinking of them or being around them. That part fades away fast but what comes next is even better! Finding out those little things about them that are kinda weird or gross lifts this veil of perfection, exposing the true, raw person you get to see where most people could only dream of uncovering. That is something no one can fantasize about, even you, because it\u2019s something you need to experience for yourself.\n\nAll I\u2019m saying is, there\u2019s more to life out there and I promise it\u2019s better than anything you could possibly dream of. You\u2019ll only limit yourself to those experiences if you continue to chase this memory of false perfection. Remember, the person in your mind isn\u2019t real. She has moved on and you owe it to yourself to do the same. You deserve at least that much.",

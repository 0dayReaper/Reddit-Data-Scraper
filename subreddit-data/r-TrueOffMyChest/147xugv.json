    "postText": "So I (m24) have been friends with my best friend (f24) for 6 years now. We met in college and became part of the same friend group. Initially she was shy, whereas I\u2019m more outgoing, so we didn\u2019t spend much 1 on 1 time, until someone in our circle starting causing both of us grief and we ended up trauma bonding over it. We became so close, keeping each other sane through the pandemic as well lol. She struggles with self confidence and I always was the first to tell her that she was beautiful and had a great personality. I genuinely wanted her to get everything she wanted because she was as close to perfect of a human I\u2019ve ever met. As time went on (about 3 years into knowing her) I realized I had feelings for her. I kept them secret out of fear of ruining the friendship. Fast forward, we\u2019re drunk one night and she dives into a rant about how no one wants her, and I get on my soap box (as I had so many times before) to tell her how incredible she was. She goes \u201cif I\u2019m so great how come no one wants me?\u201d \nAnd I say \u201cwell I want you so that\u2019s no one\u201d. And it was silence. She smiled but didn\u2019t say anything. We went to bed and was hoping we could pretend it didn\u2019t happen. I never mentioned it and she didn\u2019t either. She started seeing some other guys, and I got into a short lived relationship. Both of those things ended roughly the same time, and we moved to the same city after college. We hung out a lot one on one, my feelings still as strong as ever for her. I finally broach the subject, and she says \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it, I\u2019m just not sure how it would go for us\u201d. Which to me tells me she at least as some semblance of interest. Well then our relationship devolved into her becoming quite promiscuous and having many one time things. (Not that I judge that, I\u2019m all for people not suppressing their sexual desires). But the issue came in that from then on, she\u2019d sleep with these guys, and they clearly only wanted her for sex, and then she\u2019d be devastated that they didn\u2019t want something serious, so she\u2019d come crying to me each time seeking reassurance about her character and that she was still pretty. At first it was obviously dejecting to see the woman I was in love with go out with other people, but it\u2019s life and I can\u2019t force anyone to love me. But it became ridiculously frequent, like multiple times a week she was asking for reassurance, even interrupting my attempts to move on from her. I approached her and asked that she not tell me all the intricate details of her sex life anymore, which she agreed to do. But that last about two weeks. So last year I cut her off for about two months. When we started speaking again she promised to not do it again, and she didn\u2019t-for about 4 months. Then she met a guy through a dating app, and starting seeing him frequently. She kept asking for advice for how to make it a serious relationship, and I felt guilty for being mad that she was seeing him. It\u2019s grown to the point where I almost can\u2019t stand the site of her, although I think it\u2019s not so much because she didn\u2019t choose me as it is that she clearly just uses me to fulfill the emotional connection she needs, without having to commit anything to our relationship. Multiple mutual friends have told me that I am her \u201cfree trial bf\u201d. We have so many good memories as friends tomorrow and I feel like my feelings for her have now caused our relationship to fall into a state of disrepair and I\u2019ll never be able to get my best friend back. But my gut is telling me that at this stage of where we are in our lives, she\u2019s hurting me more than helping and I should cut off contact for good. This feels like a point of no return and I just pray I come to the correct decision, for both us.",

She doesn\u2019t seem to share your feelings and doesn\u2019t seem to care to not cross a valid boundary you put up. She\u2019s very selfish. Go find a woman who love and respects you and leave her in the past.\n\n(I\u2019m a woman if that means anything.)",

Fear is the enemy, had you done something maybe she would've gone out with you but she's promiscuous because she chases validation. She's not actually happy sleeping with all these guys because she will fall again because she's with them for the wrong reasons. Just talk to her and well if it ends it ends but at least be brave at the end",

Guaranteed this girl would\u2019ve been running to you after a month or two of no contact and would\u2019ve agreed to a relationship. You royally fucked up because you chose being a simp over being a pimp. Let this be a lesson to you for future women",

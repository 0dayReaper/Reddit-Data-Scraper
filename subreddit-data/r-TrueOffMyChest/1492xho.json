    "postText": "Hi everyone. I needed to tell somebody because it's been plagueing me for years.   \nWarning : very long text....\n\nMy brother is the golden child of the family - according to my mother, he can't absolutely do nothing wrong. He got into a good school, got a good job, is essentially the source of pride for my mom. My dad is a bit more skeptical of him, and these two men once had a period where they stopped talking to each other. But communication has resumed recently.\n\nWe discovered approximately 3 years ago that he lied to his gf about the color of his eyes (blue instead of brown - we come from an ethnicity that makes it impossible to have blue eyes plus we never have blue eye genetics in our family). He always wore blue contacts to conceal his eye color. He also lied to her about our family, he told her that **our biological mom is not his mom**, she adopted him early on (but I have the paperwork to prove that our parents are our biological parents), and that he has British origins (though he looked nothing British nor European) - this is stupid because it's my family, of course I know who's British and who's not. About one year ago when we (me, him and his gf) went out to get pizza, the vendor asked where my brother is from, he answered \"\\[our ethnicity\\] and British\". When he introduced me to his gf's family (who has heard about me some time ago), they told me that **I'm his half-sister (which is not true).**\n\nHe's also very arrogant and always tries to have the last word. He'll argue for the sake of arguing. I lived with him and his gf for one year, and I saw many times where he was plain wrong but he wouldn't acknowledge it. His gf is the same (maybe that's how they stay together).   \n\n\nWhen I got my first internship for a big company about 6 months ago, I tried not to talk too much about it because I didn't want to brag about it, I just gave simple details like where I would be working, how I will commute etc. But the conversation went to a point where I couldn't stand it and lost my temper where I tried to correct one legal thing that I have knowledge about, he didn't, of course he was wrong and he kept circling back to his opinion. Later on he told me that I tend to rage. I corrected him that when presented with facts, he refused to accept it because his ego is too big, he can't stand being wrong, and that's what makes me angry.   \n\n\nI know that one day I will have to either explain to him that he has a big ego issue, his ego makes him think that he's always right. But for now I choose to stay silent and go on with my life, ignoring the two. I realize today that I have always been happy without him and his gf in my life, and they in fact contribute nothing to my overall well-being.",

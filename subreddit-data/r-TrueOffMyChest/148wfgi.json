    "postText": "I\u2019m 20 female and my ex is 21 male. This situation happened almost 3 years ago but it still affects the relationship I am in now with another guy. I figured talking about it and having an outlet will better help my now relationship with our sex life because it\u2019s safe to say the situation has messed me up badly and I only recently realized this was the cause for my extremely low sex drive. Before dating my ex (who I will call M) I had a perfect sex drive, and I was just a better person to be around in general. I was much more open minded and bubbly and I miss the person I was before I met M. We started dating in summer 2017 and we met through work and a religious organization. M was a difficult person from the start, and a lot of people at our organization didn\u2019t get along with him which should have been the first red flag. I saw a side of him that was shy, secretly loving, incredibly smart, and funny. From the beginning of our relationship we had so much drama because we are just opposite personalities in general. We break up shortly and he leaks my nudes. I used to be someone where being topless in front of others didn\u2019t really bother me, but the fact that the photos he shared had a sexual connotation made me very uncomfortable and scared. It drastically changed the perception my peers had of me and so many more new faces considering I just started high school. From then on I was considered the school slut and I had to practically bulldoze through 2 years of high school until I had to transfer. I loved him so much that I was willing to put past what he did, but it fizzled out again considering the damage was done. We started talking again my junior year (spring 2020) and I was so happy. He seemed to have matured quite a bit. M was much more vulnerable with me and open, but his mental health had decreased drastically. We texted almost everyday during the summer while I was away, but we were unsure whether to start dating because he would need to leave for college. I got home and things were good between us. We had a lot of conversations on our relationship and we had a lot of great s*x but of course we argued a good amount too. but during October he started acting odd and he stopped talking to me as much. I was so hurt and confused so we started arguing even more. I also noticed when we had s*x he would never bring condoms which raised red flags. I eventually stopped being a pushover and broke it off with him over text. 6 months later at a dinner party his name got brought up and some girl I\u2019m friends with told me he was a r*****. The details were awful and he was also sexually coercing other girls too. I immediately had a panic attack and didn\u2019t talk to anyone or eat anything for 3 days. Over time more of his friends have told me that he ghosted them once he left, deleted all his socials and basically disappeared off the face of the earth. This is a secret I\u2019ve been harboring for awhile because his little sister goes to our organization. I live in America and now he\u2019s living in Australia cut off from everybody. I wished I could get past this but this is a dreadful skeleton in my closet I had to get off my chest.",

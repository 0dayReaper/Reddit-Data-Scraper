    "postText": "I\u2019m 16. I feel like my parents never really wanted me? My parents both abused drugs and alcohol. My dad went a-wall and abandoned me 2 years ago. My mom recovered when I was 13. I feel so much pain thinking abt my dad being in so much pain. I also feel like I\u2019m always mourning him. He\u2019s slowly killing himself and I have no clue where he is. I feel like my mom never makes effort to spend time with me. I live with my grandma because I\u2019m just too uncomfortable sharing a house with my mom. It brings back unwanted emotions from living in an abusive house years ago. She\u2019s gotten better, she never physically hurt me but mentally it was a lot. She never initiates spending time together one on one. Maybe once every three months or something. She comes to my grandmas house about 4 times a week, but she spends 95% of the time talking to my grandma and my little brother who lives with her. I try sometimes to put myself into the conversation but I never feel a part of it. Or like that she wants to listen to what I have to say. She doesn\u2019t ask me questions about myself. I always have to randomly tell her things about me. When I ask to go for drives (the only thing we ever do together) she\u2019ll most of the time either say she\u2019s too tired or say \u201c100% tomorrow or some other day\u201d and then cancel either for my brother or for something else. And I always understand and am nice about it. \n\nToday thought I just had enough. She came over to the house and I was just feeling a bit hurt about her cancelling on me again for my brother. I love my brother so much but she definitely prioritises him 100% of the time. So I was quiet today and didn\u2019t really feel like talking to her. The only reason she wanted to talk to me was because my grandma was asleep upstairs when she came over. I felt really sad thinking thoughts of if she actually ever wants to go out of her way to spend time with me. Or get to know me. I DONT know what it is about me that makes my parents not commit to me. I wanna be Someone they wanna be around. I already lost my dad so it\u2019s very painful experiencing something like this with my mom. Idk what to do.",

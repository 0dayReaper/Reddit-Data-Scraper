Being on a \"lower rung\" of the capitalist hierarchy can breed resentment. You work harder, and earn less than the boss or owner. When you own the business, asking with greater potential risk and legal responsibility, typically (or ideally) comes higher profits. For some, playing the game as the leader looks far more enticing than joining someone else's team.",

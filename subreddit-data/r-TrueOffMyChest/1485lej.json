    "postText": "At some point, around the age of 9, my younger cousin (23M) pressured me (25 F) into \u201chaving sex.\u201d I didn\u2019t even know what sex was at that point and he was the one to tell me.  We did not have great adult supervision in the household this occurred in, so it happened on multiple occasions. I know it was not actual sex, but there was touching and rubbing. It always made me feel dirty, upset, and ashamed and I carried those feelings with me well into my high school years. I know we were so young and he is a little younger than me, but would this be considered molestation? A friend was talking about childhood and such and it dug up old feelings and memories on this. I felt guilt and shame for so long and still have moments in my adult life where sex almost feels guilt-inducing and/or shameful. Has anyone experienced something similar? Any input is appreciated. I just hate that this has resurfaced and I don\u2019t know how to feel about it.",

            "comment": "I don't mean to down play anything but myself, family members, and friends all went through a period of being kids and playing the \"I'll show you mine if you show me yours.\" type thing. Just remember that kids are going to explore and really want to play grown up. Its not harmless, but it is fairly common. 9 years old is very young, and if I have it right, your cousin would've been 7? The worst thing about SA is the power inequality and coercion. Maybe your cousin was just a stupid kid and no one impressed upon him the seriousness of personal space. \nIt's okay to feel embarrassed.\nIf you feel dirty, confused, or upset still to this day, speak to someone to really iron it out! Telemedicine therapy is a really great option!",

Do I have a right to be angry with the adults who failed to properly supervise us? I mainly avoid them too, but at some point I know I just need to unleash all of their wrongdoings on them. I know I have a right to my own emotions, but does it make sense?",

    "postText": "So I  (16f) go to group therapy and there is this girl named dolly (15f) (not her real name). She was really weird. We went to the kitchen to because there's a bathroom in the kitchen and in the kitchen there were plastic knives. Dolly talked about wanting to shove a plastic knife up her ass. Dolly also tried to explode the microwave by putting it on with nothing in it. Both of these things made me feel unsafe. She had a deck of cards and she tried to convince all of us to play Texas hold them  with her (which I think is illegal because it's gambling). She took a thing of Lip gloss and took the stopper out of the Lip gloss. Because \"it didn't give Dolly enough  Lip gloss in it\". She also talks about being come as famous if not more famous as Marilyn Monroe. So I talked to the therapist and she said She could switch me to a different group but the problem is Dolly ended up overhearing me and Dolly is mad at me and I'm afraid she's going to kill me.",

Sounds like you\u2019ll have to deal with it for a while as it doesn\u2019t seem like \u2018dolly\u2019 is just gonna disappear.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, she just sounds like a really weird person. Like uncomfortably weird. I would not want to be around her after that experience either. However Texas Hold Em is not illegal to play. Also I don\u2019t think the microwave thing is far out of line for a 15 year old.\n\nShe may be upset with you for ditching her all of a sudden or pretending to be her friend (regardless of how rational that may be) but unless you have other signs there\u2019s nothing homicidal-maniac strange apparent here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nare you certain she overheard you?  \n\n\nLife tip: some people will simply attach themself to you and are hard to get rid of. For these people, if it is burdening to you, they really force you to be an asshole to make them go away. And even sometimes then it doesn\u2019t work. NEVER feel bad about doing this, it\u2019s on them. Just make sure you\u2019re aware that you may have gotten rid of a potential future friend",

I didn't even pretend to be friends with her. I know she overheard me because she said I know you've said you little asshat.",

For a 15 year old that\u2019s really weird, but she might just be immature or developmentally stunted or something. You said she goes to therapy.\n\nI knew a kid quite like this in high school. He ended up using his bizarre behavior to prank people. It was usually quite funny if you were in on it.\n\nAlso, are you a girl too? Because typical boy-ish behavior might seem extra-bizarre or weird if you\u2019re not used to being around it as a girl. Especially if it\u2019s coming from another girl.",

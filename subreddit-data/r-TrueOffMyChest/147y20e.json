    "postText": "I (21F, but 16-17F at the time) think I might have been sexually harassed by my boss (around 30M at the time) while I was in high school. He would tell me I was beautiful all the time. He called me \"honey\" and told me he loved me. Once he walked up behind me, put his hands on my (shoulders or maybe it was my hips I can't remember now), and whispered in my ear, \"you know I love you, right?\"  Another time he gave me step-by-step instructions on how to get to his house from our workplace and asked me where I lived (I didn't tell him lmao). He also bought me hand warmers in the winter. I didn't realize he wasn't doing that for other people until an elderly employee called me a manipulative, entitled bitch and reported me. Sometimes a prettier girl would be working and he would ignore me in lieu of her. \n\nI never told him to stop. His behavior made me uncomfortable, but I always tried to justify it to myself for some reason. Looking back on it now, I feel very conflicted. Like he never did anything that harmed me, so maybe it wasn't that bad? But I still feel like it was wrong, and he was possibly trying to take advantage of me. Like I would never whisper in my hypothetical 16-year-old employee's ear that I love him. That would be disgusting behavior, and I'm almost 10 years younger than he was at the time. \n\nAnyways, I found out from an old coworker that he was transferred after other young girls complained about him (there were also rumors that he had sex with a 16-year-old girl aka statutory rape) Eventually, he was fired for having sex with one/some of his employees (allegedly). I don't know if they were underage or not. He's not on the sex offender registry for the state we were in though, unless he didn't use his real name at work. ",

    "postText": "A couple of years ago my daughter (10) decided she wanted a pixie haircut.  It's super cute, and she's maintained some variation ever since.  It's also important to note that I have been very open with all of my kids about supporting the LGBTQ+ community, and have explained what transgender, non-binary, and gender fluid mean to the best of my ability.   My daughter has told me that she \"feels like a girl, but not always\" (so genderfluid).  I've asked if she still uses \"she and her pronouns\" and she told me yes.\n\nWe were at Pride today, and she mentioned how she wished she had one of the big flags.  This guy at the booth referred to her as \"he\", and when I corrected him he just kind of laughed and said \"okay\" in a \"you can believe what you want but you're wrong\" tone.\n\nLuckily my daughter didn't notice it, but it really bothered me.  This isn't the first time people have assumed she'sa boy since she cut her hair, but until today people have just apologized and corrected themselves.Sorry- just needed to rant.",

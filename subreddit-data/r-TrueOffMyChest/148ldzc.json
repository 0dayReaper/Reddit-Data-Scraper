    "postText": "To start, I'm a HUGE dog person and one of my favorite things about my job is that dogs are allowed in the office. My dogs are too ill-mannered to go with me but I love seeing everyone else's dogs. It's a small company providing social work, case management kind of stuff. \n\nI am not, however, a fan of people who take their pets around places claiming they're service dogs when they're not. \n\nBut this new person, \"L\" started yesterday, and they brought their dog, who was wearing a worn out, baggy lame attempt at a service dog vest. I saw the dog first, just standing in the hallway and I greeted it like I would any dog, by talking nicely and offering my hand to sniff. The dog had a pretty clear expression of \"don't come too close\" so I backed off.\n\nI met the owner, L, shortly after and they gave the dog permission to say hi to me. He was friendly then, but not overly friendly. He seems pretty well trained *for a pet.* L told me he came from a shelter and L trained him themself after being trained how to train a service dog, apparently. L didn't say what the dog does, which leads me to think it's a psychological issue, and that's totally fine if true. (Usually if it's a seizure or diabetic alert dog, etc, people offer that information. Also, those dogs don't leave their owner's side while they're working.) \n\nBut this dog was wandering the halls most of the day, and staring at anyone who was eating. He tried to follow me into a closed room where he wouldn't have been able to get back to his owner. When L was leaving, they had to tell the (unleashed) dog to get in the car more than a few times before he did. Today the dog wandered right out the door of the office when someone left it open. (He just stood in the parking lot till someone noticed.)\n\nI'm more irritated than I should be, probably, but too many people get away with calling their pets service dogs and it's problematic for people with legit service dogs. Also, how is that gonna work with clients? We go to clients' houses almost daily and plenty of people are scared of dogs, or allergic, or they have pets who can't be around dogs, or just don't want dogs in their homes (or their doctors appointments!). \n\nIt won't matter though, because L won't stay long. I've seen enough people come and go in my time there, I can spot the ones who won't make it through training. It's just kind of bold to show yourself as a liar on your first day.",

Just Google \"why are fake service dogs a problem\" and you should be able to figure it out.\n\nETA, it's even more problematic in this line of work. Either she's going to make her clients uncomfortable, or she's going to pass off those folks to another social worker (with an already heavy load) who doesn't bring a dog with them everywhere. Our goal is to get our clients connected to care and keep them engaged in care, and I know many of our clients would just skip their appointments to avoid the dog rather than speaking up. Sure, plenty of people will be fine with, or even happy with her bringing the dog with her, but there are enough people who won't be okay with it that it should not be happening. If he was a real service dog, it would still be an issue, but it's not.",

I've owned pit bulls my entire adult life and I'm a huge advocate but I still take issue with people passing any dog off as a service dog when it's not. \n\nI have a former coworker who got a letter from his psychiatrist saying that his pit bull was his emotional support animal so he would be allowed at an apartment complex that had breed restrictions. The dog is just as well trained as this fake service dog, and if it's a situation like that, where dogs are allowed but that breed is not, I think it should be decided on a case by case basis. Like, if one of my dogs did an interview with the landlord they would fail miserably, but this dog is an absolute delight and no one could possibly dislike him (unless they dislike dogs in general, I wish I really struggled to understand! But I know is a thing for some people.)\n\nThe whole situation just sucks because people tend to assume that any dog that you claim is a service dog or an emotional support animal gets privileges that they actually probably aren't legally entitled to. I saw a woman with a 90 lb pit bull riding IN the shopping cart at Target recently lol.",

They don't wander around away from their person, they don't beg for food, they certainly don't go outside by themselves. \n\nPerhaps you don't have much knowledge or experience with service dogs, but I do, and it's glaringly obvious that this is not a service dog. He's well trained *for a pet* in that he doesn't bark, doesn't act wild and crazy and listens to her (except when he doesn't want to get in the car, apparently). She also didn't even seem to notice when the dog was not around. Talk to someone with a real service dog and they will tell you I'm right. Also I was told that she brought the dog to her in person interview and the dog put his paws in someone else's lap, uninvited.\n\nThere's absolutely no question it is not a service dog. It may be an emotional support dog, and that's fine, but that is not the same thing and emotional support animals do not have the same legal protections as service dogs who are trained to assist someone with an actual disability. Unfortunately, a lot of people aren't familiar with this and it results in a lot of people faking service dogs just so they can take their dog everywhere with them, because most employees are too afraid to ask the two questions that they are legally allowed to ask:\n\n1. Is the animal a service animal required for a disability?\n2. What work or task related to the individual's disability has the animal been trained to perform?",

I can easily spot them at this point. It's definitely a challenging job, like all social work, but management is trying to make changes to orientation and training so that people don't get scared away so badly. For example, one of the most recent people who quit after 3 days was immediately introduced to one of our most difficult and abusive clients, and honestly I don't blame them for running. This is getting into the weeds, but we're funded by the state and they implemented some new requirements this year that makes it even harder to hire people, especially because they don't pay enough. So they've hired people who make their desperation clear.",

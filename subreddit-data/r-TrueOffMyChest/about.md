Description:

A place to get personal things off your chest. Not for opinions, not for relationship advice, and not for preaching.

Rules:

Feel free to speak your mind and please be open-minded: This is a place where all who want to get something off their chest, can get something off their chest. The Mods at /r/TrueOffMyChest will never enforce any rules that exclude any race/gender/etc. or other views from posting in /r/TrueOffMyChest. We ask that you do the same.

Do not break TOS: Do not threaten or fantasize about violence. Sexualizing minors and graphic pedophilia are not allowed.

Begging for karma is against Reddit's ToS and will be removed.

Posts must be on topic: No circlejerking. No generalizations, hot takes, or impersonal rants/opinions. Fake stories and trolling attempts will be removed.  Begging for karma or posting about how you hate that other subreddits require karma is against the subreddit rules. Political topics are fine but they must be in "off my chest" fashion.

No insults toward OP: Scolding/insults toward OP is not allowed.

Be mature: No off-topic comments. Civil debates only, name calling and anger are not appropriate here.

Do not reveal personal information: Do not post personal info, your own or other people's. Use a new account just for your post. Do not witch-hunt ever. Do not ping users who are not in the thread. These are all bannable offenses.

Posts must be personal and in "off my chest" style: If your post isn't personal in nature or in "offmychest style", it will be removed. If you want to talk about something, it either has to be directly related to you or directly impacting you - no soapboxing or hot takes/unpopular opinions.

No financial transactions: Do not offer money, give money, or request money. This is a bannable offense with zero tolerance.

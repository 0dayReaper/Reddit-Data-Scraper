    "postText": "I have been with my husband for 11 years. When we got together, I understood and accepted that him and his daughter were a package deal. There was never any hesitancy on my end with taking in his daughter and raising her as my own. \n\nWe used to split custody with the bio mom 50/50, but 3 years ago, everything changed. We were awarded full custody with her mother having visitation, maybe once every 2 weeks, for a couple hours tops. \n\nEverything was great when we first got full custody. Our daughter seemed to relax and really fall into a healthy routine at our house. She always got excited to see her mom which we thought was great. About a year ago, she started struggling in school and her attitude started to slip. We have always stated school was her #1 priority and that not turning in assignments was never okay. We started doling out consequences that ranged from no cell phone to no make up and jewlery. Couldn't have sleep overs and so on. Pretty much a \"You're not doing what is asked of you so why would you get all these extra specialties in your life\" kind of deal. Once she realized their were consequences to her behaviors, she started getting back on the straight and narrow.\n\nI want to stop here and take a moment to explain that we are not strict with much except school. We are not the type to demand straight As but we also don't deal with Fs. She has always been told Cs for subject grades or higher are what's expected of her and that she will not always do great on everything. \n\nEverything went downhill last month after a visit with her mom. She came back telling my husband and I how she couldn't wait to see the room her mom had for her at her new apartment and that she couldn't wait to spend the night. This confused my husband and I since the mother was deemed incapable of caring for a child. She is so bad she has to see her kid at a visitation center for fucks sake. \n\nWe sat our kid down to get to the bottom of that statement. According to our child, she said that once she turns 14, she is going to petition the court to stay with her mother full time since we are too strict with her school work at our house. I laughed out loud when she said that (not the best reaction on my end but I was shocked) I told her if she decides to do that, then she will have to face the consequences of her actions and stay with her mother for at least 6 months. This of course, made her angry. I got the typical \"You're not my mother\" \"I'm practically an adult, I can do what I want\" routine and had her storming off. \n\nWe talked to our lawyer who informed us no judge in their right mind would grant permission for the child to live with her mother. \n\nWe decided not to tell our daughter that since she wants to act like an adult she can deal with it like an adult. \n\nI love being a step mom and don't regret it but sometimes it makes me want to cry in a corner for an hour or 2 then put on my fake it til you make it face.",

            "comment": "First of all I want to acknowledge that you have stepped up in this kiddos life and are doing your best to support her. I know it\u2019s not easy. \n\nTry and keep in mind that she\u2019s at an incredibly difficult age right now, between the hormones and her brain developing and changing rapidly, you gotta understand that she\u2019s just going to be challenging a lot of the time. It\u2019s not personal and it\u2019s not even indicative of her true personality. I couldn\u2019t stand my mom when I was that age and now I adore her lol. That, combined with the difficulty of having an unhealthy mom is I\u2019m sure really hard for your stepdaughter. There\u2019s nothing wrong with her being excited about a new room or wanting to be with her mom, even if it isn\u2019t at all in her best interests. So try not to hold that against her. It worries me that y\u2019all decided \u201cif she wants to act like an adult she can deal with it like an adult.\u201d Please don\u2019t keep her out of the conversation and cause her more pain and frustration just to teach her a lesson. She needs support and understanding here. She\u2019s going to be an adult before you know it and she\u2019ll remember this time. Please take breaks and take care of yourself so you\u2019re able to handle her teenage years with love, care and most of all empathy. And make sure you\u2019re incorporating plenty positive reinforcement for her efforts at school. It\u2019s far more healthy and uplifting than punishments.\n\nEdited to add a sentence:)",

LOL and I told my mom no one can ever make me a step mom unless he\u2019s a multimillionaire and gives me 6 figures monthly allowance. Sorry. Having stepchildren has gotta be one of the worst things ever. If u discipline them they tell you you ain\u2019t my real mom you got no right. If you don\u2019t discipline them everyone is gonna bitch you\u2019re scared of the stepchild and he/she is still not gonna like you ever. Yikesss sorry for you OP.",

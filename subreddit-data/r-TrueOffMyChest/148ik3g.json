    "postText": "My (28F) husband, Jake (35M), and I had a really big fight last night. \n\nIt started innocuously enough because I wanted to clean up the house a little bit before going to bed and I told him to stay and relax on the couch and play his Zelda game. But there was a big clear bag of recycling on the living room floor that he was going to take out before going to work tomorrow (for context, we live on a 3rd floor walk-up). I mentioned that I was going to put the recycling bag and a large empty cardboard box outside our front door so the house would look less cluttered. I only mentioned this because I know he dislikes putting trash bags and recycling bags outside because it can attract bugs. But it was just for one night, and it was just recycling, no trash, so I thought it would be okay.  \n\nBut no, he insisted that he\u2019s going to take it out tomorrow, so it doesn\u2019t need to be put outside. So I asked him as calmly as possible even though I\u2019m irritated, why? What\u2019s your logic? He proceeds to say that he just knows it will bring bugs/roaches to our door. I told him we live on the third floor and that even though it\u2019s already a hot Texas summer, the bugs rarely if ever reach our third floor. \n\nSo now the fight has turned into who is right about roaches coming to the third floor to eat a bunch of cardboard. I know, it\u2019s ridiculous. But we\u2019re fighting now apparently. He pulls out his phone and reads the first search article he sees about roach facts and shows me the bullet point about roaches liking to eat cardboard. I tell him that any moron can get on the internet and write a bunch of nonsense. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s necessarily true. He then proceeds to tell me, in the future if I ever say anything to him, he\u2019s going to ask me for my sources so he can fact-check me. Then looks at me with a \u2018Gotcha!\u2019 face. Now I\u2019m fucking pissed. \n\nFor the rest of the night, I\u2019m talking to him, or rather yelling, and he looks down at his phone and doesn\u2019t say anything. \n\nOkay, fine, fuck you. Stay on your phone. I\u2019ll go to bed. He follows me right in and I told him to go look at his phone some more and I don\u2019t want him in here with me. \n\nThe next morning he tries to apologize and cuddle and I shove him off. He goes, \u201cyou\u2019re still angry?\u201d Fuck yeah, I am. We didn\u2019t resolve the argument at all. You just stared at your phone for 15 minutes saying nothing until I went to bed. Why the fuck would you think I\u2019m not mad anymore? \n\nEventually we\u2019re eating breakfast together and I told him I need closure. I need to talk about last night. And he tells me point-blank that he got upset and annoyed last night because when I said I wanted to clean up the house, he thought I was making a passive-aggressive comment that he doesn\u2019t do anything around the house. This is simply not true. He does PLENTY around the house. Most of the mess was my stuff anyway, I just wanted to clean up and put the recycling bag outside because the bag was sitting in front of my cabinet of art supplies and I needed a clear pathway to it to clean up my mess. \n\nThis goes back to almost every fight we\u2019ve had in our 6 years together. He constantly misconstrues every fight and situation, cooking up his own scenarios and not letting me in on his way of thinking. He always wants to believe the worst of me. That I am passive-aggressive, that I don\u2019t like to communicate, that I\u2019m out to \u201cget\u201d him. It\u2019s incredibly difficult and frustrating to be married to someone who refuses to look inward, who refuses to analyze his own emotions and then picks a fight at any perceived slight against his character. \n\nThe worst part is, he says he wants to change and improve but every fight it\u2019s the same goddamned thing every time. And I can\u2019t take it anymore. I am more and more unable to keep a leash on my anger. I think we both need individual and couples therapy, which he will probably fight me on. And it will take him another 2 years and some more devastating fights before he actually makes the appointment. Fuck. Relationships are too much work sometimes.",

Your fights aren't about what you're fighting about. Your fights are about how you think the other person feels about you, and your individual needs to be heard.\n\nRegardless of who was right about the roaches and recycling, your husband wanted his opinion heard. He wanted you to believe him when he said what he said, and then he felt the need to look it up and justify what he said. On the other hand, you wanted your husband to care and to listen to what you were saying. \n\nIf you think therapy is what your relationship needs then do your individual therapy without him. Individual therapy is individual. He can't be there for it anyways so you may as well go and work through some of your issues. Maybe he'll follow suite eventually, maybe he won't. But demanding someone go to therapy isn't the way to go.\n\nThe reality of your roach situation is if the roaches are going to make it to your front door, then they can make it into your home where the cardboard is anyways (although it's unlikely they even want cardboard to begin with BUT NOT IMPOSSIBLE).",

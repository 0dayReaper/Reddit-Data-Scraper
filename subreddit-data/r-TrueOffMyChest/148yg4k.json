    "postText": "I (18F) find myself being unreasonably envious of people in relationships straight out of a fairytale. \n\nMy last boyfriend (19M) was emotionally and verbally abusive to me. He\u2019d call me names, humiliate me for doing something he didn\u2019t like, raise his voice at me, etc. I can say that most of my exes were like this to either me or my family. \n\nNowadays I can\u2019t escape a cheesy romantic story. They\u2019re being shoved in my face 24/7 and I just want a break from it all. Now, Ik other people\u2019s romance isn\u2019t my problem but I can\u2019t help but feel angry and envious, with a hint of sadness and pity. \n\nI just want that for me, *but I never get it*. Nobody is serious about me enough to not treat me like unremovable dogshit at the bottom of an expensive shoe. All I want is for someone to love me, and want to do the little things with me.\n\nIt makes me want to cry knowing that people already have their happily-ever-after while I only ever had flukes. Idk what I did to deserve such unfathomable  romantic suffering. \n\n*All I want is what THEY have.*",

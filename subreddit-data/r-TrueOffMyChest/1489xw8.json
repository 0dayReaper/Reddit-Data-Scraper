Please take it easy in me as I\u2019m grieving right now\n\nToday I woke up feeling weird and my body was restless and unsettled. I knew something was wrong and it was most likely what had been causing me to worry the past couple days, my relationship. I wouldn\u2019t say that I blew up his phone but I definitely let him know that he needed to call me ASAP cause we needed to talk, the paranoia was getting to me and I felt that if I didn\u2019t get answers soon, I would lose my mind. After everything, I broke up with him.\n\nHowever you\u2019re definitely gonna need context to all this. It\u2019s a very long story and might end up being done it parts so be prepared to hear about the painfully stupid decisions that were made throughout this whole situation.\n\nWe first started talking last year (according to him) I didn\u2019t even know we were talking at first, I thought we were just fooling around. We started hanging out a bit towards the middle/ end of the school year. A couple month of us talking pass and now we\u2019re back on campus. It was kind of weird at first cause I had figured out at some point he developed this crush on me last year but here\u2019s where the dumb shit begins. You would assume when you\u2019re talking to someone, even if you\u2019re talking to multiple people, none of them ever know about each other right? Well considering we started off as just friends, I guess something in his mind had told him that it was ok for him to tell the girl he was talking to (me), about the other girls he\u2019s trying to get with. Again, considering the fact that I only saw him as a friend and I didn\u2019t know we were talking, I didn\u2019t really care. But he essentially would tell me about the girls on his \u201cto do\u201d list, me included but still. You would think a man would have the common sense to not share that information with a girl he claims he\u2019s talking to right? I guess he was too stupid to process that. So I guess having all that information about said people, some that I knew, some that I didn\u2019t, when I started to develop feelings for him it became a problem.\n\nPt. 2 coming soon",

    "postText": "Today is the first day in a long time I\u2019m not drinking, I\u2019m tired of being tired everyday and worrying about how much I can drink to get by. My rent is $1400+ a month and I can\u2019t afford to get by at this point, and I had been drinking to cope with that fact but now I\u2019m short on money for rent and I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. \n\nIt\u2019s impossible living alone in this economy and I\u2019m worried about becoming homeless. I\u2019m not going to by any alcohol tomorrow to, maybe I\u2019ll try a month and see how it goes. I\u2019ve been off of cigarettes for 2 months now, so I know I can do it.. I\u2019m just tired and stressed.",

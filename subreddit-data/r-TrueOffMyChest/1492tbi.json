One day in the not tok distant past i was rummaging around the main desk and found a bag of trail mix, which i don\u2019t necessarily appealing. I will tell you what i do find appealing though, is m&amp;ms, and this particular brand of mix contained that precise candy and in a relatively proportional amount i might add. I then proceeded to eat every single one and although i did think about leaving one, in the end i decided against and that was the tastiest one. I feel a little bad about it but idk if it is because i ate someone elses m&amp;ms or just when ever i think about it i dont have m&amp;ms to eat in that moment.",

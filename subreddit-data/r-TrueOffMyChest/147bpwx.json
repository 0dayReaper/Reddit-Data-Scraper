    "postText": "Literally what the title says. I have no one else I can turn to talk to &amp; even if I did I highly doubt people could understand me. \nIm 23F and I have 4 kids. \nI feel like all my life i\u2019ve been raising kids, first my siblings then my own kids. I had my first child at 14. She lives with her dads side now and although I\u2019ve thought about bringing her to live with me, I just don\u2019t want to make a selfish decision. She has such a great life with her grandma that literally gives her everything, but when i see her i can tell she misses us. In all these years I\u2019ve struggled to get my shit together. My oldest son is autistic and im navigating thru that as-well and its overwhelming sometimes being the one in charge of everything specially when we have school meetings or we go to the doctor sometimes i feel dumb because i don\u2019t understand my own child. When I was 16 i met the father of my youngest 2 kids. My son was 2 months old and we basically started living together from that moment and he took on the role of being my sons dad, but this isn\u2019t a fairy tale its real life and things got bad really fast. I had my daughter and 3 years later I had my youngest son. \nThe father of my kids was 20 years old when we had our youngest and I guess the pressure of everything led him to start using drugs, during our relationship we were physically/verbally abusive to each other. We separated 3 years 1 which he spent in rehab and 2 where was out but relapsed so i stayed away from him for a while unless it involved our kids.  \nLast year around this time i had a \u201ccome to jesus\u201d moment after a car accident, when i got home i started drinking heavily and ended up calling him that i needed him. I dont know why? Maybe cause of everything we had already been thru? I learned now that it\u2019s something called\u201d trauma bonded\u201d specially since him and his family were the only \u201creal family\u201d i had in years. Since that day hes been living with me. Im glad hes here now because it alleviated some of the stress off my shoulders (he literally got clean a day after moving in and hes 100% clean). He got a job and started helping me out with the bills so all i had to do was just care for our kids and keep up with the household (basically a sahm all over again). All my kids except the youngest are in school and now that the time is getting closer to him going to school i just dont know what to do or what im gonna do. Ive spent all my life just identifying as a mom/wife that i don\u2019t  know who i am or what i want out of life. I wake up everyday and do the same routine for almost 8 years already and some days i drown myself in depression because im starting to be more aware now that i guess i have the time to notice. Ive thought about even hurting myself or running away when deep down i know thats not what i really want, i love my kids. I want them to have the love and support i never had but its just becoming more difficult for me to be emotionally available for everyone when i dont have 5 minutes to let my brain breathe. I think thats why i feel like running away sometimes. I always said once my son went off to school i would sign up to go to college but i cant even do that because i dont know what i want to do or if it will even be worth it in the long run, i just dont know anything anymore\u2026\nIf youve read this thank you alot \ud83e\ude75",

If you want to go back to school, do it! Pick a major in something that interest you or something you could build a career out of. Aside from school, I\u2019d say to try out some new hobbies. Maybe start going to the gym? Dance classes? Reading? Painting? Find something you\u2019re interested in and try it out! There are endless possibilities for you. Just put yourself out there. Best of luck to you!",

The change will not be at an ideal pace (what you may be expecting) but it will happen for sure, even if a little bit at a time. You have to keep trying, All the best!!",

    "postText": "I (24f) have never been a person to struggle with mental illness, depression, or suicidal thoughts. However, I had my first suicidal thought today and it was stronger than any feeling I\u2019ve encountered. \nI found out I was pregnant last month and miscarried five days ago. My boyfriend (32m) and I had just broke up and 1 weeks later I find out I\u2019m pregnant, when I go to tell him he ends up proposing (dramatic I know). But the reason he left in the first place wasn\u2019t because we didn\u2019t love each other. Anyway, we\u2019re engaged and going to therapy to figure out life, coparenting, and marriage. I had a fear of miscarrying. I work in healthcare and know the odds but stayed positive and soon that baby and my future husband became the most important thing to me.   He is currently out of town in Oklahoma long term, for work. We had spent a weekend together where he randomly said as he was snuggling me that if I lost the baby, he wouldn\u2019t leave me. I found it odd but comforting\u2026because ultimately yes I wanted him to be there for me and not just the baby even if the baby played a significant role in us. \nThen five days ago, I had intense pain and heavy bleeding\u2026 I knew I was miscarrying before I went to the doctor. I got no response from him and went by myself. It was the most scary moment of my life and I endured it alone, I don\u2019t resent my fianc\u00e9 because I knew he\u2019d be out of town until I was half way in my 2nd trimester. I then, as I was actively miscarrying, drove to Oklahoma where my fianc\u00e9 was staying to be with him. The only he said to me was \u201cit\u2019s going to be okay, you\u2019re going to be fine\u201d. But, he\u2019s my fianc\u00e9, of course I needed to be with my significant other in this depressing time. I passed the sac 4 hours in, in a gas station toilet. My heart was shattered into a thousand pieces at this sight. I then was able to ground myself and find peace and some healing with being in my fianc\u00e9s presence. I then asked if he could come home this coming weekend to which he replied \u201cyou aren\u2019t pregnant anymore\u201d. This shocked me to my core and confused me because I had thought that him and I were better than ever. It escalated into an argument where he was telling me that he in fact does not want to be with me, he is not happy with me, and the only reason he came back and stayed in the first place was the child. My heart went from being shatter into thousands of pieces to millions. I just lost my baby, I already feel as the biggest failure and then I lose my fianc\u00e9? Am I the biggest loser or what. The conversation ended with him saying that he needs to find his happiness and get a handle on his depressions. I am completely at a lost because now is the time I would need him more than ever. I feel depressed. I am completely numb. I feel as if I\u2019m a zombie waking up, going through the motions, feeling pain and then going to sleep. And today\u2026 I wanted to kill myself. I wanted to die. I shared this with my fianc\u00e9 (or ex fianc\u00e9, I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s happening) and his response was \u201cnow I have to stay with you because your suicidal?\u201d \nBut I do, I want to die. I have never felt such a strong urge to die. And I kinda don\u2019t even want him anymore because he failed me, in a time a fianc\u00e9 or wife would need their other so desperately he can\u2019t and won\u2019t even be there for me. But yes I\u2019m combination with losing both my fianc\u00e9 and my child\u2026I want to die so badly and go to heaven and be with my baby. \n\nDo I need to check myself in?",

Unfortunately you\u2019ll likely sit there for a many hours until being checked out by a psychiatrist or similar consulting physician. \n\nPlease call a trusted fiend or advisor to help you in the short term.",

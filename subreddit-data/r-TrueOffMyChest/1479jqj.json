    "postText": "I work at a bar and one day I walked in o the glass wash room next to the bar and a girl I work with thats kinda new who I haven\u2019t talked to stared at me kind of smiling a little as I walked in the doorway as she was sorting glasses and she didn\u2019t look away  but I thought nothing of it. The next weekend I needed to ask her where this food was going  to as I was going holding the plates and  she put her hand on my arm (around my arm I think like holding might have been nothing) as she pointed the table out, when I walked back round to wrap cutlery she stood in front of the cabinet with her hands on her hips tilting her head left and then right while she looked at me as  I was wrapping cutlery on and said \u2018you make me sweat, Graham\u2019  and then come to the side of me and held her arms out for a hug and smiled to which I backed off because I was like thinking \u2018wtf\u2019 she then dropped her arms looked at me sad faced and then walked off and I wasn\u2019t around her again until she finished which seemed strange.\n\n\nThe next night we were on a close the pub shift and in the staff room at the end of the night as she was putting her coat and scarf on  she said \u2018I haven\u2019t got a boyfriend you know, Graham\u2019 and smiled as she was putting on her scarf and the other guy at work there with us laughed out loud glanced up at both of us as he was on his phone  and I looked at her and she was smiling with her teeth showing type at me after saying it and then look away as she was fixing her scarf",

    "postText": "I am 14f almost 15f wnd my brother is 13m almost 14m . Before I get a bunch of comments telling me that its just a rough patch, no, it isnt . \n\nSlight T/w for mentions of my brother harming animals, physcially hitting me, and constantly verbally degrading me . \n\nMy brother and I have lived in a rather small cramed space since we were young. We live in an RV . We have always had sibling spats but after being stuck at home with each other it has amplified . We also live with our grandparents since our mother did drugs for a while and even now, we dont completely trust her and want to stay with our grandparents \n\nMy brother is constantly and I mean constantly standing up and lumbering over me, he reads random stuff on my phone,  and he invades every inch of space I get. He also tries to rely on me for every bit of friendship he can have since other than me because he is in online school since covid. I was online after covid till this year, my freshmen year of high school  .\n\nMy brother is far past a peace of work. He mouths off to our grandmother like what she says means nothing.  She has a fiery temper and so does she, so its always stressful more than normal because of their arguing and neither admitting they are wrong . Normally whst starts it because im arguing about how my brother won't sit down or how he continually mocks every word that comes out of my mouth and calls me names when i haven't done anything or i do something he doesnt like. But all they do is tell me in dramatic for making such a fuss all the time and it basically us irrelevant if they didnt hesr it. \n\nBut he mocks me and calls me the B word as well as the word that starts with a c and ends with a t. He also points out and basically makes fun of the fact im bisexual, constantly calling me names . As well as this anytime we joke and have a nice time he makes it all about s*xual things and its really annoying . \n\nWe also have a dog. She is a large breed. My brother slaps her, kicks her and overall aggravates her. This isnt the only dog he has done this to.\n\nAs well as this, when i do something he doesnt like or talk to him in a \"bad tone \" he hits me or threatens to. He treats me like dirt. Less than human. My grandfather tells me i should just hit him back but he basically doesn't do anything when he's there. \n\nBut even with all of this , hes my brother and somewhere i care about him but he is just so...i dont even know the words.",

            "comment": "I know you don\u2019t want to hear this but you are both children. You\u2019re being forced to grow up way too fast and you both may have some trauma responses from what you\u2019ve been through. It sounds like your brother is following the examples set for him by your relatives. You\u2019re all he has, and vice versa. I can\u2019t imagine how hard it is not having a mom and dad to say goodnight too. Be the example you want him to be, kill it with kindness. Talk to him about what you guys are going through. It\u2019s hard on you, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard on him too. Hold on tight and help each other, you will only have each other and life is only just beginning for each of you. I would do anything to have my little brother back.",

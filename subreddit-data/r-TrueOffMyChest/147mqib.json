    "postText": "So let's start from beginning. After seven months of my father abounded my mother and she was  31 she took care of me and my sister who was 7 y.o my. She used to work to get bread and butter . She used to lock me when she is going for work and my sister used to go outside to play but she barely took me with her. In the school I was bullied almost daily in the house no one never really listen to me but they used to beat for me many reasons sometimes I my head used to bleed because my sister have hit on the head and she've beaten many times there was sometimes when I used to get beaten on a daily basis. When I was 8 year I tried to runaway from my house thrice in one year. First time I didn't understand but out of the blue Instead of going home from school I ran from my house and I walked miles I took one train to a city but some people noticed me and they checked my books and called my mother and the second and third time I ran away because I my sister scolded me and beaten and I hated that place . As year goes I started I became more and more lonely i never had someone whom I can trust I didn't had any friends whom I can talk or share i became more and more lonely and no one never really bothered how I'm all they did was blaming me for problems i tried to kill myself many times like hanging myself, eating poison and drowing etc since I was 9 but I was too afraid to that I failed. As tried once again running away from my house when I was 14 year old but  this time out of fear because when I was out my mother or sister came home and they started calling where I was which made me so fearful that i thought of escape and soon I got more and more lonely and as pandemic hit I just worsen my life both my sister as well as mother where home which made me felt like I'm their servant and it became more worse and I decided to move from home to my native place which my mother didn't agreed but soon she agreed and I thought I'd be more in a better place but soon I got it's like the same and in the last one year it becoming more and more worse and soon I realised how bad they were and in the last month i got in touch with my father but it made me depressed to know the reality but now I don't know whom I can trust whom I can't i looking for peace of mind but everything is just fucking with my brain now I don't know what fuck I'm supposed to do. I'm thinking of move out from this place or you know\nOr else committing a serious crime to get jailed because I'm seriously done with everything in my everyone ignore me like I'm a stone no one really care about until it's extremely serious or else it is harming their reputation. The girl I liked she hated what can I say I don't how to express anything I was in relationship which only last for 1 month thanks to my sister she thought that the girl isn't i listened to her and the day I broke up with i got to know that she only loved me because I and her bestfriend had much similar characteristics and then a girl I had crush on she treated me like I was just an optional shit or something and please if anyone can put into an rehab or budhist ashram I'd love to go there",

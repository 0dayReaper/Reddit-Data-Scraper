    "postText": "$600? Is this supposed to be a fucking joke? Our government refuses to send financial help for months, and then when they do, they only give us $600? The average person who was protected from getting evicted is in debt by $5,000 and is about to lose their protection, and the government is going to give them *$600.?* There are people lining up at 4 am and standing in the freezing cold for almost 12 hours 3-4 times a week to get BASIC NECESSITIES from food pantries so they can feed their children, and they get *$600?* There are people who used to have good paying jobs who are living on the streets right now. There are single mothers *starving themselves* just to give their kids something to eat. There are people who\u2019ve lost their primary bread winner because of COVID, and *they\u2019re all getting $600??*\n\nChrist, what the hell has our country come to? The government can invest billions into *weaponizing space* but can only give us all $600 to survive a global pandemic that\u2019s caused record job loss.",

For me - understandable situation, there are other questionable things they have done but with our rather weak position I don't expect money from them. We don't have \"budget too large\" like Germany does lol.\n\nAmerica on the other hand is one of the biggest economies in the world. You are way richer than us.\n\nSo if I was living in America I'd suppose that this country is capable of giving its citizens more than fucking 600$. Especially that they can drip **trilions** in fucking military to the point where getting hospital ship is better solution than just opening temporary one on ground",

Most of her friends ended up getting nearly 8 grand in unemployment &amp; cares act money, some retroactively in huge lump sums, and she still can't get a single cent, because state unemployment refuses to recognize her claim because she was offered her job back at one point, and her doctor who recommended she not go back has basically changed her tune, refuses to provide a letter and told her \"I recommended you not go back because you were clearly anxious about the risks, but I didn't tell you that you shouldn't go back, you made that decision on your own\".

Contrary to popular belief, the tax differences between Canadians and Americans aren\u2019t that great. We just get the bang for our buck - you guys get an army. \n\nIt\u2019s ridiculous to me.

I've been able to support myself fine up until this year, however after losing my job and not being able to find new work the money has dried up. Yes, moving would be a great solution, however I'm broke with little options. Not to mention that moving doesn't help if I don't have a new job lined up. As the comments saying I want \"more handouts\" what handouts have I gotten? Unemployment is it, what I want is to be able to work again, SAFELY, not handouts.",

We should start a petition or protest to suspend pay for congress! They have failed to do their jobs so now they must suffer with the rest of us! Use the salaries to help fund a new relief bill we can all survive on. Its a insult to us all and they should know we are insulted!",

There needs to be relief, protection for renters, breaks for both renters and landlords(That is, to help them not completely lose out on the deal, but not to take advantage of their renter either), and more aid in general. \n\nFurthermore, the $600 is too generic, and shouldn\u2019t be based on last years income(at least the $1200 was, which is flawed as they may have made far less from losing their work). I meet the requirements to receive it, and will gladly take it, but I\u2019m one of the lucky(sort of) few that has kept work(In healthcare; it\u2019s a shitshow, but better than not working). I have lost money sure, but I have kept debt free during this. I am hugely fortunate; but people like me enjoy the money, but don\u2019t need it. People that need the help aren\u2019t receiving enough, and some like me are merely getting an extra check(going straight into savings in case I\u2019m eating my words in a few months; but I know many who bought game consoles or guns with the money).\n\nedit: Per the Washinton's Post summary: \n\"Democrats fought to establish the first-ever emergency federal rental\nassistance program to be distributed by state and local governments. These funds will be targeted to families impacted by COVID that are struggling to make the rent and may have past due rent compounding on itself. These families will be able to utilize this assistance for past due rent, future rent payments, as well as to pay utility and energy bills and prevent shutoffs.$800 million is reserved for Native American housing entities. It also includes an extension of the existing CDC eviction moratorium through January 31, 2021. \" \n\nSauce: https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/read-the-summary-of-the-908-billion-economic-relief-proposal/25faf998-b77f-4cbc-8e19-20ffac8213ba/\n\n\nSo it exists, but to what extent I cannot say. $25 billion sounds like a lot, until you realize the $600 checks is $166 billion; so at best this is going to be a minor aid from the sounds of it - not nearly enough to help everyone.",

If landlords had mortgage relief that was passed on to renters it would solve both problems. Though of course we can\u2019t trust landlords to actually pass on the savings, but that\u2019s another conversation.\n\nEdit-thanks for the award kind stranger!",

McConnell could care less about us and only cares about power and judges. Just these politicians sitting down to lunch spend $600 a lot of the times.

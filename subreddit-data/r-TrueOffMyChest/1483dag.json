    "postText": "I (29f) have been married to my husband (27m) for about 3 years now. I am a long time lurker and first time poster. I have been debating on if I should post this or not.\nI have problems with sex. I have told him this before. Now when we started dating it took about 5 month before we actually had sex. Now we both want kids. But we don't have sex that often. I don't touch myself often either. Should have mentioned this but was a virgin when we started dating and I was not. I have had experiences in the past that left a bad taste in my mouth. Now I showed my husband a tik tok video and he sent me something about it and I was trying to explain that the video is kinda gross. Now as I said, I have had bad experiences. He wants me give him head and taste his nut, I told him I have before just not with him (I didn't say that to him in the text). He says \"right. Another thing you have experienced with other men, that I don't get to experience\" now he knows all the things that have happend to me in my past. I don't bring it up, but when I said I have tried something and won't do it again because I don't like it. He gets upset, honestly gets a little mad at me. I don't know what to do. I love him. He tells me that I'm not doing my wifely duties when I'm not having sex with him. He also is constantly asking if I'm sure about wanting kids and I really do. Sex is just really complicated for me.",

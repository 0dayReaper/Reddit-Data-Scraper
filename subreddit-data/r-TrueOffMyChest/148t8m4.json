    "postText": "I started a job in a completely new field all remote and after a week of in office training I was told to remain at home and work. Started off okay, but the remoteness of it caused me almost immediate stress. I didn't understand what the expectations were from me apart from how many hours a week I was supposed to work.\nI was having fun learning new things until I house sat and from all the driving around missed a full day of work (didn't check emails). From that exact time I have had overwhelming fear about opening my emails. I started therapy because I became suicidal when thinking about how I had let everyone down. This fear has led to me slowly missing at least one day a week. I have never been this type of person. It's been frustrating to not ever feel quite capable of digging myself out of this mental hole. \nI am moving across the country and am using this as an excuse to leave the position, but holy cow, I'm beyond disappointed in myself.",

Maybe remote work isn\u2019t for you, and that doesn\u2019t make you less than or a bad person. Don\u2019t be so hard on yourself, we\u2019ve all gone through a lot the last couple of years. Take the lessons and try to move on and give yourself a break. You\u2019re only human",

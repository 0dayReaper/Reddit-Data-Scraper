    "postText": "I (14M) very recently been getting closer and closer with my friend (15F). For the sake of the story we\u2019ll call her G. We\u2019re in the same year, and have known eachother for two years now. Our relationship has always been bordering fwb, and we\u2019ve done stuff a couple times. Up untill very recently, she got back with her ex boyfriend (14M). \n\nTwo nights ago, my other friend hosted a sleepover at G\u2019s house. Things were going great, we had around 5 people; and everything was going normal. Up until the night, where she started speaking as if she had broken up with her boyfriend. Not truly confirming anything, but seeming as it took her 3-5 days to tell her last time that she broke up with him, i just kinda assumed.\n\nThen, during the night, at around 3am, she started to do stuff, and i returned the favor. everything adding up, i had become almost certain that she was no longer with him.\n\nup until yesterday morning, an hour after i left, i texted G, and said \u201cHey, howd breaking up with Boyfriend go?\u201d and she sends a message that makes my heart drop. \u201cI can\u2019t yet.\u201d\n\nSo now im still freaking the fuck out. her boyfriend is a fucking asshole, and i truly mean a fucking asshole but he doesnt deserve this?? What do i do? Am i considered a cheater?",

And in regards to the bf, it is entirely you choice to tell him what happened, I can see valid reasons to do either. \nI hope you figure this out! \nAlso I\u2019m glad you reached out for help when you wanted/needed it. It\u2019s a great thing to do!",

    "postText": "  Since my little pup died earlier in the year, I have been in a bit of a depressed state. I remember the night clearly as if I were still in the moment. Olive was the cutest little mutt I ever met, and sometimes, I can still imagine her morning headbutts into my stomach. Since her death, going to her grave has been the most difficult thing ever, and I've only gone gone with her brother, where he has tried digging her up with his paws. Being with her for more than 5 minutes will cause me to start crying, remembering the night where all I could say was \"My baby\" over and over. I was finally able to go out to visit my little girl today for around 10 minutes. I dressed up for her, read her a story, and sang the song I would play during thunderstorms that would calm her down. I miss my baby, but I'm trying to work on getting myself back on my feet, so the point where I will not start sobbing whenever a coat zipper brushes against my door, making me think its her knocking to be let in. She died quite early on in life, and though I feel guilty about not giving her all the pupcups she deserves, I am glad to have been able to visit her.\n\nMy apologies for the rambling, I just needed to get this out of my brain. And, my apologies for any possible spelling errors, as while writing this, I started crying.\n\nHave a pleasant day",

My current cat is just about 15 years old now and, thankfully, still extremely healthy. I've had him since I was in my freshman year of high school and I occasionally find myself filled with dread over having to eventually endure what you're going through. I'm glad you're moving forward because I'm sure your dog would only want to see you happy and I hope I can find the same strength that you have when I need it.",

We can only hope that they feel happiness and peace in their last moments and that they have a wonderful afterlife. But I hope you can spend as much time as possible with your cat before the enviable happens.",

    "postText": "I wake up at 5AM every morning. The usual routine, coffee, breakfast and I listen to true crime podcasts (a great way to always be on your guard in harmless situations btw). \nIn my country it\u2019s pitch black outside at 5AM so it\u2019s quite creepy. My front door has a large window in it covered with foil so you cannot see through it, you can only see figures and shadows. \nSo I stand in my kitchen, as I see a dark shadow  through my front door window walking around my neighbors houses further down the street. The person is holding a flashlight and continuously walking from door to door peeking around with the light, moving closer to me. Keep in mind that it\u2019s pitch black outside and it\u2019s 5AM in the morning. I almost can\u2019t see this figure, all I can see is the flashlight moving closer. I stand still in my kitchen observing this individual. \nMy anxiety increases the closer this shadow comes to my door. \nAnd let me tell you I AM READY TO FIGHT as the person walks directly up to my front door with the flashlight shining through my window. Their blurry figure is much more visible now, but still all I see is just a dark shadow of a tall man standing right on the other side of me lookin in. It felt like slender man was finally out to get me. The door handle starts moving a little and that\u2019s when I decide to jump up and walk towards the door. I make sure that the steps towards my door is as heavy and violent as I can make them, so I kinda go fee-fi-fo-fum and then violently and brutally throws all of my body weight at the door as I slap my fists against the glass yelling \u201cyou\u2019re not welcome here!!\u201d. I continue to slam and brutally abuse my door to threaten this dangerous intruder and the man starts running for his dear life. The flashlight is frantically moving up and down as he runs away into the night.\nI calm down in my victory but I quickly realize that there is something hanging on the outside of my doorknob. As I open the door I realize that it\u2019s the package of my frantic shopaholic purchase a few days prior. He was so sweet he even made sure not to place it on the ground. \ud83d\ude2b\n\nIf any of you should be appalled by my very extreme reaction, in my defense I suffer from CPTSD and I am constantly on my guard lol. \n\nI really wish I could apologize to him",

There is no way yoh could have known he was the delivery guy in that context and you did what you had to do to protect yourself in that potentially dangerous situation. Otherwise now you have a funny ass story to tell",

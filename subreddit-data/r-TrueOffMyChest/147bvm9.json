    "postText": "SEXUAL ABUSE WARNING \n\nWhen I was a young boy, about 6-7, I was introduced to sex by another girl who was the same age as me. During a game of truth or dare she dared me to lick her vagina, and then she showed me my first porn magazine. It wasn\u2019t until our adult life that she told me she had been sexually abused by her brother. \n\nA couple years later when I was around 10 I had a younger cousin who was about 6-7 who I dared to lick my penis. My cousin doesn\u2019t even remember this happening, or at least pretends not too. \n\nIt disgusts me that I was a part of this chain and since becoming old enough to comprehend it all I have been battling major depression, and my therapist told me this is something I should never speak about. I\u2019m not sure what to do about it.",

I know my mother, the alcoholic, couldn\u2019t be bothered with me so that had a lot to do with it. It also has a lot to do with my hatred of my mother, and why when I have children, she will not be watching them.",

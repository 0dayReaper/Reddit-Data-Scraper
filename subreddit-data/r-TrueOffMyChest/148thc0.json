    "postText": "Apologies for bad composition. This is kind of a frazzled post, and I've never been on reddit before. I panicked and made an account to say this-\nA YouTuber I like mentioned this sub and I jumped at the opportunity. Apologies if any of this language is offensive / not politically correct. I wasn't raised with access to this kind of information- so I hope you'll forgive me. \nI think I'll also post this on r/lgbtq (if that exists) \nHi. I'm 17 years old in the United States. \nI won't give my real name- Lillianne is what I've been calling myself in my head so Lillienne is what I'll ask you all to call me. \nI've grown up in one of those families- the ones nobody likes to be around. I have two straight parents and two older sisters. Growing up I'd play dress up with my sisters, my oldest sister would be Cinderella, my other sister would be Aurora, and I'd be Snow White. \nI think my childhood was the best time of my life. \nBasically as soon as I was 10, this was all shoved down the toilet for the typical \"man up\" routine by my parents- particularly my dad. \nI think I convinced myself I liked manly things by the age of 12. I don't know if I ever really liked it - maybe I didn't. \nEverything got awkward around Middle school. I'd expressed this\nMy parents were of the opinion that everyone feels uncomfortable in their changing bodies and I shouldn't be too worried about it. I believed this\nI still, occasionally, lived vicariously through my sisters. Sneaking into their closets when I was home alone, trying on their heels and dresses, stuffing bras to make myself feel like a real woman. Even using makeup \nI'm shit at makeup but it made me feel like a pretty woman.\nI've come up with this whole world in my head, separated entirely with the life I have\nI'm a woman named Lillianne, with a husband and children. It's a fantasy I've never shared with anyone before. Ever. \nI won't go too into detail with my real life, that's not very important. I'll just say, I don't run with the transgender crowd. I mostly stick around my guy friends who're all stereotypically masculine and sporty like I'd convinced myself I was. My friends or family catching wind of this could absolutely ruin me. I don't know what to do- I'm confused and this whole confession is driven by blind impulsivity and how much I hate looking in the mirror.",

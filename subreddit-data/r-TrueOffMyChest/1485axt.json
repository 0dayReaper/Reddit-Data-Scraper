    "postText": "About a year ago, my ex left me because he felt like he needed to get his life together and figure himself out. He comes from a family where there's a lot of pressure for him to find a high-earning job (lawyer, doctor, finance, etc.), and he felt like he couldn't focus on building his career foundation with me in the picture. I also want to mention that a few months before the breakup, he started having frequent panic attacks and fell into depression around the time he turned 30. I tried to offer him my help and be empathetic, but nothing seemed to help.  \nI was devastated when he broke up with me. We had an amazing relationship, by far the best I've ever had, and I genuinely thought he was the one. We both cared deeply for each other, made each other laugh, and never ran out of things to talk about. If I had to describe what I look for in a boyfriend, he is it. I know it may sound like I'm idealizing him, but he's smart, funny, kind, thoughtful, and incredibly loving. He was my best friend. He always put me first and took such good care of me. He took me on trips around the world and did everything to make sure I was comfortable and happy. Everyone around us saw the way he treated me, and all our friends and family were shocked when they heard the news. His mom was incredibly surprised and told me she thought he would eventually propose. A few days after the breakup, she invited me over to chat. She felt terribly sorry and told me not to lose faith. She believed that he and I were really meant to be, and that he just needed to figure himself out. She told me that he admitted to still being in love with me, but he just couldn't have me in his life at the moment. I also want to mention that when he broke up with me, he sobbed and begged me not to shut him out of my life and to stay friends. He even offered to buy me flights so I could visit my family and told me to reach out if I ever needed anything.  \nInitially, I couldn't help but hold onto the hope that his mom was right, but after roughly 5 months, I gave up. I finally let go of the idea that he would ever come back.  \nNot long ago, he reached out to me and asked if we could be friends. We went out for coffee, and it felt like nothing had changed. We were having fun as always, and it was nice to see him again. It also seemed like he might want to eventually rekindle things. He told me about everything that's been going on with him, how he got his life in order, and he seems happy. Things have changed on my end too. I completely shifted the direction of my career to something I'm incredibly passionate about. I was open to the idea of being friends, but I'm starting to realize that I might not want more than just a friendship. He had valid reasons for breaking up with me, but knowing that at one point he didn't want me in his life is just really off-putting. It doesn't even hurt anymore; I just find it disappointing.  \nAm I being too harsh? I miss our relationship and everything that came with it, but I don't know if I can ever look at him the same way. It's such a shame because he checked all the boxes.",

What happens when he needs to \u201cfocus on his career\u201d again? You deserve better \u2014 there will be someone in future who checks all the boxes and is willing to prioritize and stick by you even when life is hard for them.",

He'll just pop off and take a break again?\n\nYou deserve to be a priority in someone's life, maybe not the top #1 spot, but definitely up there. That off feeling you have about his decision to just quit you is valid. I wouldn't know how to feel about someone who can literally just put you aside and ask you to stay put until they're ready.  \n\nLife moves forward and a risk he took by doing what he did was that you were probably going to move on without him. Hence the crying and begging for an open door to friendship. It's on you if you want to continue this but you seem strong and capable and have self-value to do better by you. Good luck OP!",

My partner ended up being my biggest support as I slowly rebuilt and turned my life around, he also changed careers during this time and I supported him.\n\nAt the first sign of struggle he cut you off instead of growing and transitioning with you. Which is the foundation of a long term relationship. He also tried to have it both ways and insisted on wanting to keep you as a friend, having his Mum chat to you to let you know \"he hasn't completely shut the door\" so he could keep you around. \n\nI think you should listen to your gut. If you don't want to maintain a friendship don't. You deserve to be a first choice. Not a backup option that gets dumped every time your partner finds life overwhelming.",

His reasons just Sound reasonable but when you actually look into it, a lot could have been adjusted. My current partner did the same and within 4 months into our dating during covid. I lost my job and I was hassling with my immigration papers and dealing with pressure from my family. He stuck by and actively cheered for me and made sure I can relax whenever I had free time.",

Not how people work. You deserve someone who knows that they want to be with you and you deserve to feel secure in your relationship. \n\nI'm glad your meeting with him went well, but just from his vibes, it feels like he thinks he can just pick up where he left off. It might be best for everyone if you let him know sooner than later your feelings. I hope you get closure on this relationship",

    "postText": "Sorry if it's long I wasn't sure how to word it\n\nI hate the whole idea that Just because I'm lonely and would like a relationship I should ' work on myself. I also have Idiopathic Hypersomnia which also sometimes makes me feel lonely because it stops me from doing most things and leads me to stay home.\nBut  I've been ' working on myself' for ages and  my self eseem is pretty good all the time even when I start to question it it can be both low and high at the same time.\nI enjoy my own company and don't mind doing stuff alone, hell I've do basically everything by myself, from going to the odd concert and even just to the footy but after a while it also gets Lonely too, not having anyone I can go to or someone who wants to go to me and share when something cool happens in the day or when I'm/they are feeling down,  someone to be able to go do those things with, someone to cuddle with and even just be around, and who I can have silly little moments with.\nBut I find anytime I tell or try someone I'm lonely and down (which usually happens at night and the cold) it's always, \" maybe you should work on yourself\" and so I really don't bother anymore.",

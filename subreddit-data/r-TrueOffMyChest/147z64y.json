    "postText": "I can't get out of the hole I'm in.\n\nI worked 30 hours over the weekend and I spent almost every cent today repairing my car. My university deleted the last two classes I needed to graduate this summer because of a \"discrepancy\" on my fafsa and because they're refusing to authorize my loans without a cosigner (for the first time, and I have no one willing to cosign).\n\nThe other night when my car broke down I called a few friends and I didn't get a response, so I called my dad. He came to pick me up and he said, \"I hate when people put their shit on you. You need to grow the fuck up.\"\n\nI'm 22. I was on a really great track before the last few years. I prided myself on being my parents' easy kid. I never drank, snuck out, even skipped a class. I graduated high school with plenty of college credit and I went to an affordable state university. My parents divorced when I was 18 and both kinda dipped out of my life for a while, and I depended on only myself for a long time.\n\nI have a lot of mental health problems, and I always have. I've been in therapy on and off since 14 and I've always had a tendency to give up on myself. It just never mattered much until now, because in high school it's easy to recover, and now it isn't. \n\nAt 19 I got into a really violent relationship and it fucked my life up. I threw away thousands of dollars (withdrawals from classes, unaffordable car, apartment I shared with my abuser). I developed a substance abuse problem. I could have died and I really thought I was going to die, so I stopped giving a fuck until around 21. At almost 22 I moved back in with my mom for a couple months and tried to get my life back on track, and here we are.\n\nIt's hard to come to terms with how much damage has been done. My credit isn't horrible but it's not good enough anymore to get me low interest rates and independent loans and shit like that. I'm really borderline contemplating my entire life right now and I don't know how to get help. Part of me thinks there isn't enough help in the world for me.",

    "postText": "We've been dating for 3 years and I'm 24 and he's 28 and he's a good person. But my parents, they don't approve of him because he's that old and they don't want to me date him. Since they said that, I haven't been answering any of his text. During my break at work, I did call him for him to meet me here and to talk. This was the conversation we had and how it went down:\n\nBoyfriend: Why haven't you been answering any of my text, is something wrong?\n\nMe: yes, there is a problem...\n\nBoyfriend: what is it?\n\nMe: ...I don't think we should see each other anymore...\n\nBoyfriend: what, why?\n\nMe: I respect your tolerance, but... I learned something true tolerance has decency at its boundary. We have to accept some standards of right and wrong. And without that nothing makes sense, nothing works.\n\nBoyfriend: but what does that have to do with us?\n\nMe: you've already planned on outgrowing our relationship.\n\nBoyfriend: what do you expect from me?\n\nMe: nothing. But, I try my best to live by my parents standard of decency. And to accept anything outside of that boundary is a dead!\n\nBoyfriend: but why does this have to be so black and white?\n\nMe: it's not about things being black and white. It's about right and wrong, and loyalty. I just want to do what's right!\n\nBoyfriend: what about making the world a better place?\n\nMe: it's time to think beyond high school debates and newspapers.\n\nBoyfriend: don't do this to me, Your by best friend! Why not, trust your heart?\n\nMe: I believe with my whole heart, that this is the right thing to do! If I start a relationship, I has to be with someone my parents will approve of. I can't accept anything less. I'm, not comfortable with your standards anymore!\n\nAfter this conversation, I removed him from my messages and phone calls. This was also his first time being in a relationship.",

Live your own life, don't live your life for your parents.    Your parents sound waaaay to overbearing for someone who is 24 years old.",

            "comment": "I'm one hundred percent on board with this, but not for any of the reasons listed here.  \n\n\nDude deserved better.  \nI'm sure OP is lovely, or kind, or whatever, but she's not a \"whole adult\", and until she outgrows living by her parents, or anyone else's standards for that matter, she'll never be able to commit wholly to a partnership.  She'll never be, for lack of a better term, her own person.  \n\n\nI don't want to be with someone who's still tethered to their parents, who needs their approval or permission or praise.  Have a relationship with them, great, but be an adult, have some form of independence.   \n\n\nShe wasted 3 years of this guys life refusing to grow up, being, essentially, a semi-independent child at best.  \n\n\nWorse, just... blindly accepting what your parents tell you is moral without questioning it is, to put it mildly, dangerously na\u00efve.  Most people figure out their parents are as dumb as the rest of us in their teens, if you've hit 24 and you still think they always know what they're talking about, man, I don't even know where to start with that.  That's incredibly sheltered, and sooner or later it's going to bite you and any potential partners you have right in the ass.   \n\n\nI value critical thinking, not blind obedience, and in the case of OP, I don't think you get any of the former, only the latter, and... honestly that would feel a bit like taking advantage of a child, whether she's legally 24 or not, she's not remotely \"a grown up\", I think that much is obvious, and at the end of the day her boyfriend, or ex, is better off free to pursue someone that's a functional adult, that can be a partner and a peer.  \n\n\nTruthfully, I have little patience for this sort of thing.  I kind of hate \"respect your parents\" culture, the only thing anyone needs to be a parent is working genitals, that shit doesn't make you an expert in anything, an authority on anything, and it's all well and good to listen, you need to figure out how to tell when they're full of it and when they're sharing something of value.  Just blindly going along with it is stupid, just let them arrange a marriage if you're that set on doing what they want, why the fuck are you out there dating when you're just going to bail on someone else's say-so and not your own.",

            "comment": "Usually, or I suppose traditionally speaking nowadays, people used to date with the intention of finding a long term partner and have the ideal preset that they\u2019ll be together for the rest of their lives (marriage). Obviously dating has trials and errors, like what you\u2019re experiencing. With that being said, I don\u2019t know if that is your intent (to find a potential mating and life partner), but you would be the one procreating with them, spending your life and time with them. It\u2019s not your parents place to dictate who you date, but I get what you mean by wanting to please your parents. From experience though, if parents don\u2019t like your SO, it can cause for family discourse - whether it be necessary or unnecessary discourse. I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is don\u2019t end your relationships solely because your parents disapprove because at the end of the day, no one will be good enough for you because you will always be their daughter who they probably love so much. So take that with what you will and date who you want. You should put your needs first above your parent\u2019s expectations, but within means of your parents liking them as well. But you don\u2019t *have* to - it\u2019s your life and choose what you see fit. And biologically speaking, people subconsciously look for similar characteristics that reflect the same as their parents. Because growing up, your parents most likely (one would hope) provided a safe and loving environment for you to grow. When/if you get to that time to start a family, individuals subconsciously look for similar traits, morals, and values in their partners because that\u2019s what they were raised on. Again, that\u2019s not always the case. But I would agree with the fact that it does make life easier to pursue actions like this. But if you\u2019re just hooking up, then who tf cares lol",

                    "comment": "Edit: and what I mean by necessary or unnecessary discourse is that there is a difference, sometimes parents do know if someone is treating their child terribly, and sometimes parents just pick fights because they disagree with something so small. For example: if you dated someone that verbally abused you but you continue to justify it as \u201cyour love language\u201d (this happened to me and I was verbally abused to believe that it was actual love) if your parents say something then I would say that\u2019s necessary discourse. Unnecessary discourse is like your parents getting upset that your SO is not religious when you and your family are. Because you can still be a good person without being religious. Both of these examples are from my experience - however, my parents aren\u2019t upset that my husband is agnostic whereas I\u2019m Christian. They know he\u2019s a good man and will always be there and that\u2019s all they want for me.",

Lots to think about. \n\nMaybe they want you to stay home and care for them in their old age. You could be in your 60s before you are allowed to make your own decisions",

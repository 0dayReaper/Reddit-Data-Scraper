    "postText": " Its come out in the past 2 years my dad is a horrible POS and has treated my mom like shit for the worst part of 2 decades. I idolised that man. Loved him more than anything. Trusted him with my life.\n\nI hurt my own partner because I thought the behaviour he was modeling was right and just no matter what. \n\nAnd I hate him. Gods do I hate him. But it hurts so much. I've lost something I will never be able to get back because I cannot trust him anymore.\n\nAt some points he seems just like my old dad. But that just hurts more because It makes me rememeber the good times we used to have. But not even 10 minuets later he goes back to the miserable POS who couldn't give less of a shit about me.\n\nI just want my dad back..",

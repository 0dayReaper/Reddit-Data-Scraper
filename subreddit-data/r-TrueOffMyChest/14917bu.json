    "postText": "it's been 3 years now since my mom took me out of school. i'm 16 now and stuck in my room. all i do is watch random youtube videos or surf the web. i'm so jealous of other teenagers that go to school. i would love to go back to school just to get a sense of normalcy and have a chance to socialize, i've missed out on so much, i'm pretty certain i have maladaptive daydreaming as a coping mechanism because of how hard it is to come to terms with how this is my life. my mom has already enrolled me back into school, the school should have everything they need. i don't know what convinced my mom to do it, i think she just did it because i asked several times, i hope i can get back in school considering the HSPT they'll make me do. this all feels way too late when it comes to achieving my goals in life like making some friends and hopefully finding a partner one day. it's hard not to feel hopeless in such a weird/terrible situation like this.",

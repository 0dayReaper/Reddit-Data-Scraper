    "postText": "This happened a while ago but I just need to get this off my chest. So one day my girlfriend who isn\u2019t always in the right mental place at times tells me that she is going to end herself. I pleaded with her not to, and then she stopped talking for 10 minutes and then on the phone was her friend, let\u2019s call her Summer. And Summer was telling me that I was the reason and that my gf, let\u2019s call her jo, killed herself because of me. She even said, \u201cDid she really love you, if she loved you she wouldn\u2019t have killed herself\u201d which still messes me up whenever I see it. And after 20 minutes of being mentally tortured by Sammy, jo gets back on the phone and says \u201cJUNE FOOLSSS I DIDNT DIE I LOVE YOU\u201d to which I lost it, I screamed at her. I had told her about my past with suicides, how I attempted, how I stopped people and how I failed to stop people, and yet she still did this. As it turns out she gave Summer the phone and just didn\u2019t do anything because she didn\u2019t know when to intervene, even though I asked, pleading, for her to be joking. Then she typed, didn\u2019t say, typed a paragraph about how she was so sorry and that the only reason she did was to make me worry because this relationship was too smooth and there wasn\u2019t any worry. Needless to say i broke up with her and all of my close friends and her friends said it was the right thing and yet I caved and took her back. I don\u2019t love her anymore but I still care for her. I want to break up with her so badly but I just can\u2019t. She\u2019s going through a rough patch and I can\u2019t throw her farther down that pit. I honestly don\u2019t know what to do. I want to stay with her but she is killing me slowly. Also she says she\u2019s an awful girlfriend, to which I couldn\u2019t agree more, but I have to fake it and say she isn\u2019t awful so she can still be happy so she won\u2019t pull another stunt.",

No one will blame you if you separate yourself from a toxic situation. Especially since it sounds like it\u2019s having a significant toll on you. TRAUMA BOND. Please read into it!",

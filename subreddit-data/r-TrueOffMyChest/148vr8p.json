I may be autistic so some social ques or reading in between the lines is very difficult for me and I don\u2019t understand. I always feel like I\u2019ve done wrong in some regards although all I ever do is try to be good. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve hurt anyone it was never my intention. I think I need help.",

    "postText": "Hi, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m even posting this to the right place or how to do this exactly but anyways I\u2019m here because last night I was kind of taken aback by my date. We met on a dating app and have been texting for a few weeks but made last minute plans to get a drink last night. So we got a few drinks and then he asked to go to my car. I figured he wanted to kiss so I said yes. He was such a gentleman. He opened the door for me to the bar and to my car which I thought was so sweet (most ppl don\u2019t open car doors on dates anymore). So we started making out in the car but it was soft and gentle, then he starts biting. After a few minutes, he asks can we drive somewhere else. It\u2019s close to my house so we went to a park I know close by. So we get to the park and start making out again\u2026then I climbed on top of his lap and sat on him while we kissed. It started getting a little rough with lip biting and light choking. Then he lightly taps my face on my cheek with his finger tips and I remember thinking \u201cthat was so soft. He better keep it that way\u201d. Then all of a sudden out of nowhere when I stop kissing him and look up at him, he slaps me hard. I was so shocked I didn\u2019t know what to do. Then he did it again but even harder. I was honestly scared. He was so gentle at first and was so delicate with me, licking and kissing everywhere so passionately, then all of the sudden \u201cSMACK\u201d. I understand this is a kink and I didn\u2019t know what to say after. I\u2019ve never had that happen before and I don\u2019t think I liked it. Before he did that, he whispered \u201cyour safe\u201d during the choking (which I do like) and maybe the soft taps were a warning that he was about to really slap me but I was really caught off guard. I thought maybe if someone were ever to do that to me, they would ask before or wouldn\u2019t do it so hard. I mean, that was one of the hardest smacks I\u2019ve ever had (I\u2019ve only ever been slapped on the bum which that\u2019s saying something bc slaps on the bum go pretty hard). I don\u2019t know if I should just embrace the bdsm or obviously tell him I didn\u2019t like that, but my biggest concern is that he may end up physically abusing me. I just found this very odd because we never discussed kinks beforehand and this was our first time meeting. Very bold of him I thought.",

Having consensual sex, no discussion of kinks/boundaries (which I have now learnt should be a must do beforehand) and got full on pelted slapped across the face. I honestly didn\u2019t know how to respond so just pretended it didn\u2019t happen but ultimately it made me feel like a plaything there for his desires with no concern as to whether I was into it or not. I also have sexual trauma so my relationship with sex is complicated anyway. I was annoyed with myself for not calling it out but the fight or flight response doesn\u2019t allow us the choice to choose, it\u2019s a matter of keeping ourselves safe from sudden perceived danger.\n\nMy advice on this one is absolutely regardless of anything (whether you liked it, whether you thought he was cool in other regards, etc) this is a massive red flag \ud83d\udea9 because any respectful man would have asked very clearly to gain consent before doing this. i would also say they most likely wouldn\u2019t bring any kind of kink like this up until you\u2019ve gotten to know eachother more and feel safe and secure in eachothers company unless it was very clear beforehand that the meet-up was sexual and you\u2019d already discussed both sexual likes and interests etc. If I were you I would not meet this man again, as he has shown you quite clearly what is to be expected of him in future which will also likely worsen if he feels allowed to continue.\n\nSorry this happened to you OP, not ok in any regards and you did nothing wrong here",

My (31M) most recent ex (31F) had a slapping kink (she liked to be smacked on her butt and face) I knew about the spanking part (and honestly she didn\u2019t have to tell me, it\u2019s kinda second nature for most guys) but she only told me about the slapping her face about 3 months in. I never in my right mind would have tried it unless it was something she explicitly showed interest in. When it comes to kink, you need to be 100% sure you\u2019re okay with what you\u2019re on the receiving end of, especially when it\u2019s something like that, because if it actually starts to hurt or bother you, you need to be certain he\u2019ll stop when you say so. That\u2019s the reason my ex and I\u2019s links worked, I\u2019m a dom but with a dom/sub situation the sun is giving permission for everything being done and is merely feigning subservience, they\u2019re truly the ones in control because if at any point they don\u2019t want to do it anymore, they can use a safe word and we\u2019re done. \n\nEither speak up and tell him you didn\u2019t like it, or leave him if you\u2019re scared he will abuse you.",

There's nothing wrong with a little slappy-chokey... but it has to come with sensitivity and communication. Somebody who just hauls off and hits you on the first date with no negotiation, no warning, no checking to make sure you're okay before doing it again, is not a safe person to be around.\n\nYou deserve better!

A big part of that is not engaging with a vanilla (non kinky person) without a full on conversation wherein the kinky person recieves consent to and talks through the kinks they are interested in engaging in, safe words, lot of safety stuff, etc. \nTHIS CONVERSATION IS NOT MEANT TO BE HELD IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THESE ACTIVITIES.\nThis conversation is meant to be had sober, calm and without the expectation that it will immediately result in the discussed activities. THIS IS TO CREATE A SAFE SPACE TO DISCUSS WHAT BOTH SIDES ARE COMFORTABLE WITH!\nWhat this man did to you is abuse. That may be HIS kink, but it would definately have me heading for the hills. If this is his kink, his kink is suprise abuse and that is terrifying. Do not accept a dom you do not trust, regardless of whether or not you decide to pursue BDSM.\nYour power in a kinky situation, if you are a sub, is your ability to say no. A good dom, the type of dom you want, is the one who you can TRUST to IMMEDIATELY RESPECT that no. If this is not the case, you are in a very dangerous situation.\nBDSM is about trust. This is not a man you can trust to have your wellbeing and safety at heart in a kinky situation. He is about his gratification at your expense.\nI really hope, for your sake, that you do not engage with this individual further. I can not fully express how unsafe this is.\n\nPlease, miss, do yourself a favour and run for the fucking hills!",

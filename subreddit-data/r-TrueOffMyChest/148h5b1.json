    "postText": "To preface, I'm really happy with my current girlfriend, and I'm hopeful we'll get married. But at the same time, I miss my (6) exes, as they were lovely people. Honestly, I would love to just sit down with each of them again and just catch up and feel remnants of what we used to have. I imagine it would be so nice. But even if they were open to that, it doesn't sound like a good idea, and I wouldn't want to upset my girlfriend. So I don't think this will ever happen, but I still fantasize about it as a guilty pleasure and secretly hope we'll bump into each other on the street and get to hug and catch up.",

You don't have to be best friends with them, or see them every day. It would give you that sense of closure you're looking for. \n\nI'm happily married now. Years ago, before I was even engaged, I went through something similar. I reached out to two of my ex's (we were all still Facebook friends). Just like me, they had both moved on with their lives. They had better jobs, healthier relationships, and they matured so much. That's what made me realize that they weren't the same people as they were when we dated 5, or 10 years ago. I was genuinely happy for them that their lives turned out good. \n\nWe don't talk anymore, but they were a big part of my life during those points in time so I'm just glad to know everything worked out for everyone.",

Thanks for sharing :)\n\nHalf of my exes blocked me on Facebook after we broke up. 2 of them mentioned it was best for them to cut contact and not see each other's social media to get over the relationship. That makes me fairly apprehensive to reach out.",

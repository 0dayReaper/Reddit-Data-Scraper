    "postText": "Declawing a cat is equivalant to cutting off your fingers (not medically but cats use claws like we use our fingers.). Why is this even legal? Same with \"debarking\" dogs. Oh you lazy piece of shit, you can't be bothered to train your dog not to bark? How could a veterinarian even do something like that? You could not pay me enough. Give your cat up for adoption or take it to the pound even if it means it will most likely be euthanized. Declawing a cat is about the most cruel thing you could possibly do to an apex predator like a cat. Debarking a dog is just equally cruel. How would you like it if your parents surgically removed your voice box because you talk too much?\n\nYou people make me sick. You all should be charged with animal abuse to the letter of the law. Throw the damn book at you.\n\nEdit: explained what I meant by the finger analogy",

Something in my gut told me he was going to trim his ears even if I didn't consent to it so i took my dog and left.",

Back in the day they had a tax on companion dogs, so docking became pretty standard as to prove to the tax man that the dog wasn't a luxury, but a working animal. I don't agree with docking dogs whatsoever, but if it makes you feel better, it's an uncomfortable procedure that doesn't permanently harm the animal. I grew up on a sheep farm and we had to dock the lambs tails for health reasons ( long tails on wool sheep get soaked with shit and piss and can create all sorts of sores and nasty infections). The lambs of course don't like it but they get over it pretty quick.",

The idea is that those pets are better off in a home than dead or on the streets worsening the stray/feral population.\n\nIn my opinion both procedures should just be outlawed, so vets opposed to it aren't put in a position to have to try to talk their clients out of it in the first place. Right now if you're a vet who refuses those surgeries your client can just go find one who does instead of trying to learn from any education you try to give them. A lot of vets do refuse to do these practices and just have to accept that any of their clients who are dead set on getting them done will find a vet to do it anyway. If it wasn't legal people wouldn't get it in their head that they can \"fix\" their pet with surgery in the first place.",

Some people honestly just care more about themselves than anything or anyone else in the world, and when you\u2019d rather take away your pets form of communication or defense rather than find a safer alternative or training then you\u2019re not only lazy, you\u2019re an abusive POS. I worked with a woman at the hospital who had tons of cats over the years, and she declawed all of them, not because they did anything to warrant action, she just refused to let them into her home with claws.

She's always been normal to all our other pets and dogs and isn't even bad at training them. But she and this dog seemed to mutually hate each other and I'm so sad that this was the outcome. Fortunately, she agreed to rehome him to this older couple and he was extremely happy with them. But oh man, I feel so much guilt over the declawing even though I didn't even live there at the time. I definitely would have tried to stop her if I knew about it beforehand. :(",

We would rather not do them at all, but it's legal in our state and we would prefer to see it done correctly if it'll be done. The clinic up the road just takes a pair of nail trimmers and cuts the joint with them, we at least do a full joint amputation with a scalpel so there's fewer complications. I also just don't do anesthesia on it because I get sick watching them happen, and I've got a pretty strong stomach otherwise. Like I'm usually the one who does the necropsies and GI surgeries, I like to think I'm not a weenie..\n\nAnyways, just with increased client education, so far this year we're down to one declaw that wasn't medically indicated.. and then we had one that we did for some autoimmune condition and we did a couple single digit amputations for nail bed melanoma. I'm pretty happy with how well the additional client education has worked.",

They debarked him so he wouldn't be annoying, barking outsideat being left alone all day. Poor thing. It was like  whisper barking.",

Just understand that docking actually has a practical use, unlike debarking or ear cropping.",

Some argue it reduces the risk of ear infections, but this has no backing. Tail docking however, when done correctly and appropriately, is proven to prevent injuries and subsequent infections common to the tails of undocked working dogs. I've seen how mangled a tail can get from just standard breed-typical working behaviours, and trust me a quick procedure as a pup is much, much less painful than repeated breakages, skin tears, infections, etc to the point that the tail often needs docking later in life anyway.",

Inevitably ripping it open again and starting the process over, after alot of vet visits and multiple recommendations from multiple vets she made the decision to move forward with declawing. It sucked jut they did an amazing job on the surgery and the cat recovered very quickly both paws and head wounds.

            "comment": "My wife is a vet. She hates that she is required by her practice to perform declaws, but their reasoning is the same as why some vets will perform ear trims and the like - people are cruel and will perform the procedure themselves or have a breeder or someone else who THINKS they know what they are doing do it without sterile equipment, anesthesia, training, etc. The trick to fixing this is LEGISLATION. Make it illegal to perform these mutilations. My wife went to vet school in Colorado, where declawing is illegal, so she never had to perform that surgery until she went into practice in Arizona.\n\nDon't declaw your cats. Aside from the defense angle, it also deforms their paws over time and will cause terrible pain as they age. Don't debark your dogs. Don't do unnecessary surgeries on your animals.",

A declawed cat is better than a dead cat/wild cat or a cat living out they\u2019re lives in a shelter. Debarking a dog though seems rather lazy. \n\nMy sister saved a cat but he kept destroying all the furniture. Tried training him not so do it for a couple months. Tried the little pads you put on, but nothing worked. Finally it got the to the point where we either had to declaw his front claws or get rid of the cat. Vet who did the surgery said he\u2019d rather declaw a cat and know he\u2019s going to have a loving home for the rest of his life rather than refusing and the cat going to a shelter or the wild or getting killed. Debarked seems fucked up though.",

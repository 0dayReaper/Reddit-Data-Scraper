    "postText": "TW: ED \nI\u2019m 22 and I\u2019ve had mostly the same friends for most of my life. For the most part, we all grew up together. Half of my friends are skinny and of that half, a few have had eating disorders. Most of them are like a size 0-6ish. \n\nI\u2019m a size 14. I\u2019ve struggled with disordered eating and harmful habits but never a full on disorder. I have empathy for those friends and I\u2019m so happy they were able to get the help they needed and are in better places. \n\nOne of my friends who had an ED has a pool. Every time she has a pool party she always brings up how great she looks and how she never realized she was this hot because of her ED and she would have never worn this bikini 2 years ago because she thought she was bigger. I\u2019ve had to stop seeing her. I\u2019m happy she\u2019s doing better and I hope she continues to do better. But I can\u2019t be around her when I know looking like me is her worst nightmare. \n\nI learned early on that I can\u2019t go shopping with those friends. They go to stores that don\u2019t have my size. It\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s just awkward and I get embarrassed. \n\nOne of my other friends is really into thrifting. I am too. We both care about the environment  and it\u2019s something that made us close. I use thrifting apps as much as I can. I rarely shop at real thrift stores because there isn\u2019t much in my size section. She loves to go wonder around these stores because there are more options for her and asks me to go with her. \n\nOn our way back from thrifting one day I brought up this new pair of jeans I got from American Eagle. She had just gotten a pair from the thrift store we were at. I was explaining that it was really hard from me to find good jeans, let alone jeans from a thrift store. She goes \u201cit\u2019s really not that hard.\u201d I didn\u2019t say anything. She hadn\u2019t made comments like that before, but she has made some since then. \n\nI\u2019m a us size 14 now. I was a chubby kid. I was 5\u20196 at 11 years old, taller than everyone in middle school and in the first few years of high school. \n\nEven now, and back in high school, when guys would hit on me my friends would get really weird and even mad about it. Thrifting friend and I almost had a falling out over one of our mutual guys friends would flirt with me all the time. She had a crush on him, although she never said. I didn\u2019t feed into the guys flirting, because I value her feelings and I\u2019m a lesbian. She was just mad at me or mad that her crush wanted the fat girl over her. \n\nIt\u2019s just hurts to know they don\u2019t think I\u2019m worth romantic attention and that looking like me is their worst nightmare. \n\nI\u2019m finally at a spot personally where I\u2019m fine with my body. I\u2019m eating better and healthier than I have my whole life. I\u2019ve been working out consistently and I\u2019m happy in my own skin, aside from this. I\u2019m not trying to lose much more than 30ish pounds, and I\u2019m on track. I don\u2019t want to be skinny, and I\u2019m tired of being shit on by my skinny friends. \n\nI know they don\u2019t really mean to make me upset. They just don\u2019t get it, and they never will. Thanks for reading.",

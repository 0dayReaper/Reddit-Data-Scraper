    "postText": "I had been with my boyfriend for 1.5 years. He recently moved in with me not that long ago. After living with me for some time he started accusing me of cheating on him. He tried to kill himself on one occasion and threw himself out of a moving car on a different occasion when I would try to end things with him. I wanted to end things with him because I couldn't take being accused of cheating on him over and over again just because I didn't want to do it.\n\nAfter he tried to kill himself and his grandmother shifted all the blame for his behavior onto me, I stupidly gave him one last chance. I know it was stupid and I don't want to hear anymore about how I should have known better, I should have ended it the first time, etc. I know all those things by now. \n\nTonight he woke me up multiple times, holding my hands down, groping me, and I told him multiple times to stop because I had to be up early for work. Then he woke me up biting my arm and I had to hit him on the arm to get him to stop. He grabbed me by my necklace and pulled on it til it broke and he threw it on the floor. And I got up and left the room. I called the cops and he came into the living room and tried grabbing me again when I was on the phone with 911. Then he put his fist through the glass of my snake's terrarium that cost me roughly $1000 to build up.\n\nHe again tried to say he was sorry. But I've heard that before again and again. \n\nMy snake is fine, his hide protected him. He is in a small 10 gallon terrarium right now that I had as back up. He's not full grown yet so it will do until I get a new full sized terrarium. But I had to throw nearly everything away I had acquired for him because slivers of glass were all over the wood hides and decorations and wouldn't wash off.\n\nMy now ex-bf is currently in jail and I don't know how I can work this morning in a job that requires me to drive for hours. I'm emotionally a wreck and I keep going back and forth in my head over whether I really needed to call the cops or not. I don't know why I'm sitting here blaming myself for his actions. I'm upset that he broke the necklace my mother gave me for my birthday years ago. I'm upset that he shattered the terrarium I spent months building up. I'm all over the place mentally and emotionally and I hate myself for it.\n\nI needed to vent this. I don't want advice or finger pointing. It's done and over and he's in jail. Tomorrow I will bag up his stuff.\n\nEdit: I appreciate all the concerns, well wishes, and support but please respect my request for no advice. I am not completely defenseless, I have taken security measures long before this happened and he doesn't have keys. I have people looking out for me and on my side here. All the comments telling me what ifs and giving me worst case scenarios of what could happen are not helping my mental state mere 12 hours after the shit hit the fan.\n\nIf you can not respect that I didn't ask for your advice I will resort to blocking people.",

Anyone who will put their fist through something when they're angry are one step away from hitting you. Please do not stay in this relationship; it is volatile, abusive, and toxic. Break up with him, and never go back. If you can't afford to move out, please find someone to take you in. You can't continue to live like this.",

All of these are illegal.

There are many victims from similar situations after their partners were released, many didnt end well. Please take the extra steps to protect yourself, especially change the locks on your doors. Even getting cameras on your property wouldnt be bad.",

This ex is physically aggressive, a person who can\u2019t control his emotion is a bad person and doesn\u2019t deserve you connection. Do it over a call. This is a closure for you, not doing it fir him \n\n2. Call your work and tell them that you were attacked and you are unfit to work safely. You need to process the event emotionally, busying yourself with work is not good for mental health. And don\u2019t understand the emotional impacts on event like this \n\n3. Arrange a zero contact way to give him back his stuff. Pack and send it to him, AirTasker or something. A bit $$ spend is worthwhile to avoid being attacked or any \u201chear me out\u201d waste of time\n\n4. Find formal legal advice or DV support, reddit is good echo chamber but you still need professionals \n\nYou deserve better. Hope you are able to move forward gracefully, one step at a time",

I was sleeping and he was upset cause we haven't done it in a week. This is common for me leading up to my period and after 1.5 years he should be used to it. He didn't even start acting this way until the last couple of months which leads me to wonder if another commenter was right about him doing drugs or if he's been cheating.",

His behavior is not your fault. \n\nPeople don\u2019t understand how hard it is to leave an abusive relationship until they themselves have been in one. Don\u2019t let these people who are judging you get to you! An abuser will cry and be so convincing that they\u2019ll change just to keep you. \n\nI\u2019m sorry he tried to harm your snake. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s okay. \n\nI actually broke up with my abusive narcissist ex the day after I was arrested and sent to jail. He attacked me after I found out he was cheating on me, slammed me down on the floor and smacked me hard in the face. Mind you, he\u2019s a gym bro- 6\u20191 and 220lbs. I\u2019m 5\u20192 at 130lbs. I\u2019m tiny compared to him. The only way I tried to defend myself was by scratching his face. I did the same thing as you and ran away to call the police. He attacked me again when he saw I had phoned them. When the police showed up, they saw he had blood on his face from the scratches and arrested me since I didn\u2019t have any \u201cvisible\u201d signs of harm of my body. Not yet at least. All the bruising and swelling showed up a few hours after they released me. Anyway, the police wanted me to take a cab straight home but there was no way in hell doing that. My dogs were at his apartment so I trooped my ass over there, picked them up and left. He was crying and pleading for me to stay, saying he was sorry and that he didn\u2019t know what came over him. Then he was begging me to let him drive me home. \n\nThat was the last time I allowed myself to be abused by him. It took me *three years* to leave. \n\nGood for you for leaving him. Congratulations. It\u2019s not easy!!!",

Aside from hurting me, assaulting me, and scaring the shit out of me on a regular basis, he broke things of mine that had extreme sentimental value and things that were expensive and that I cared about and couldn\u2019t be replaced. He always made me question my reactions to his behavior and I always fell for it when he said \u201cit\u2019ll never happen again I love you\u201d. It\u2019s all lies. \n\nI wasted 8 years of my life with that fuck, and I wish I could have that time back. I thought I wasn\u2019t worth shit and he was all I deserved and now I know I made a huge mistake by forgiving him over and over. Get away and stay away now, and never look back. You didn\u2019t over react. Don\u2019t ever let yourself feel that way, I promise you it\u2019s not your fault and you are not the reason he is the way he is. You deserve better. No matter what it feels like now, you deserve better. Don\u2019t take him back, extend your no contact order. \n\nNow I\u2019m with an amazing wonderful beautiful human being who cares deeply about my well-being and understands what I went through with my ex. He would never ever hurt me, and is so patient with me; I have severe PTSD and used to be easily triggered but I have healed so much since getting away from my horrible ex and I\u2019m so thankful for my now husband who taught me to love myself. Everything in my life is different now, and in the best way. I know you didn\u2019t want advice, but I really identify with your post and wish someone had told me early on to get a restraining order.

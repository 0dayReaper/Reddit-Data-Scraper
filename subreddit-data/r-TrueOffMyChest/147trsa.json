    "postText": "I want to make this clear from the start, my ex and i are in highschool. Whenever i first had a crush on him, we'll call him A, several girls had come forward saying that he had raped them or sexually assaulted them. i take responsibility for not listening to these girls, i faced everything with a certain skepticism. I had this twisted ideology of \"well they didnt do it to me\" to ignore rumors. fast forward to whenever me and A are dating, he has cheated on me not even a month into my relationship, and for a while i broke up. then we'd call and text and play videogames together; i liked the attention he gave me because i had never really recieved anything like it. So we got back together and it would be on and off for a while. he would try to get me into polyamorous relationships with the people he cheated on me with. at the end of our relationship i had been cheated on between 8-12+ times. a lot of these times were the same: he'd message them, say he was horny, beg for nudes. Whenever i broke up with him finally i realized he genuinely was embarrassing to be around. and he has made me feel coerced into doing things i didnt want to do. im not saying im a victim, but he had a way of manipulating me into stuff like whining and begging. he got on his knees begging me, crying, pleading for me not to break up after i found messages between him and someone else. fast forward a few weeks later-now- i apologized to all of the girls i hadn't listened to and tried to make amends. he has a new girlfriend now, which apparently doesnt go to our school, so if she doesn't live near us, shes gonna be cheated on left and right. i feel bad for this girl because she has no idea what kind of person he is. i was in the same spot as her, and i surely didnt listen to people telling me he was bad. so ill just let her figure out what kind of person A is on her own.",

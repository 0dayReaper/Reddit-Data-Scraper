    "postText": "Hey sorry, I deleted this bc I think I need to add some more information and I didn\u2019t wanna stump people by adding things in the comments (it usually confuses me so I figured it might confuse others too also im new to reddit posting, NOT THE APP) \n\nAnyways a problem happened in my relationship with my (16M) boyfriend (17 in abt two weeks) and I (16F). Some background, he\u2019s kinda popular because he\u2019s really good at volleyball in our area and one of the best in the region I\u2019m in too. I\u2019m super proud of him and obviously I support him so much. Before we started dating, my boyfriend was a bit of a fuckboy jock and I have always been a nerd and super quiet. He\u2019s also in the grade above me. We\u2019ve been dating for 5 months.\n\n1. Before we started dating, he had this girl friend, we\u2019ll call her Sarah. Sarah plays volleyball too and she\u2019s supposedly not very good as to what my friends tell me. My boyfriend claims they\u2019ve never had romantic interest in each other and that she was with his best friend for a while. Her and his best friend split up but still had a little thing. They decided to joke around and my boyfriend commented \u201cW bae\u201d on her Instagram post. At this time, my boyfriend and I had started talking and he commented \u201chot asf\u201d on my post. I saw his comment on hers and asked him about it. I didn\u2019t expect loyalty because we weren\u2019t dating. He tells me it was a joke and he deletes the comment + blocks her (I DIDNT TELL HIM TO DO THIS). Sarah is also known for being a pick me and flirts with everyone. I\u2019ve never spoken to her. When me and my boyfriend became official, I asked if he could drop her and not be friends with her anymore because she makes me uncomfortable because of how she was encouraging the joke of him flirting with him. I\u2019ve never asked him to drop a friend since then and before that either. He agrees and unadds her and all that. I also made it clear that I just didn\u2019t want them talking because she\u2019s also best friends with his ex. He agrees again. \n\nThe other day, I was talking with my friend, we\u2019ll call her Melissa. Melissa plays volleyball too and saw my boyfriend walking with Sarah into the courts together with a friend. She tells me that it looked like Sarah was his girlfriend or something. I get upset and I asked my boyfriend about it immediately. He confirmed that he did talk to her. His story is that \u201cHis dad dropped him and his guy friend off. She was outside and told him he needed a player of the club (her) to get inside. She didn\u2019t know that they weren\u2019t friends so that\u2019s why she came up to him (he never told her) He decided to wait with her, even though he already had his other guy friend inside but said he didn\u2019t wanna wait five minutes. They walked in together and he said he barely talked to her. I felt really sad because why couldn\u2019t he just wait for his guy friend? It made me really upset that he did that and she\u2019s again, known for flirting. I know he didn\u2019t cheat but it makes me so mad that she was able to just get him to talk to her without thinking. He apologized and said he wouldn\u2019t talk to her again and I forgave him. I\u2019m just so upset.",

            "comment": "Dial the jealousy back a little.   It's only cute to a point.  They are in school together.   They do a sport that causes them to share a court.  They are going to bump into each other.   If you trust him your best course of action is to tell him to limit interaction with her.   He will resent you if his life is inconvenient enough for long enough even though he did nothing wrong. \n\nI almost gave up track one year over a jealous girlfriend who didn't like a girl that ran.   Girl flirted with me a bit but I shut it down while dating my girlfriend.   She found out my girlfriend was jealous and started flirting even harder.   I shut it down but she would still find ways to try to get near me.   Eventually my gf told me to pick track or her because she would not have me near that girl.\n\nI dumped her.   The other girl also stopped flirting with me a week later.  She probably would have dated me but I wasn't going to validate her or feed into the rumor that she was the reason for the break up.",

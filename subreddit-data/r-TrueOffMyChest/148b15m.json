    "postText": "I love my grandma, and I love spending time with her, she's funny, sharp, and very social (oh and INSANELY SMART) only issue? Her 90year old potato sack she calls partner. He's unbearable! Rude, toxic and just all together mean, to everyone around him, including her. He gives her sh*t every time we go out (for a 2h brunch mind you, once a month, sometimes less!) We aren't allowed to speak our native language around him, aren't allowed to talk about anything that isn't of interest to him and I kid you not, aren't allowed to smile, or even joke. I can't take her out cuz he's so annoying about it, and I can hardly ever bring myself to visit their home as he's obviously always there. I want my grandma back! I understand I simply need to \"wait it out\" but it's just so frustrating! \n\n*Side note: I'm not looking for advice, we've tried everything, she doesn't wanna leave him cuz he's old. He was always a bitter old man, but the older he gets the worse his behavior has become. I just wanted it 'off my chest' as I feel like I'm losing my best years with my grandma for a rusty rude and loud potato sack.\n\nWhen he was younger and still fully independent, my grandma and I had all these plans to travel just the two of us, do things, study together etc. Pandemic and his age hit, and now she's on \"house arrest\" for \"talking out of turn\".",

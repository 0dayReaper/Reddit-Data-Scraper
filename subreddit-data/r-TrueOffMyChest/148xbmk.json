    "postText": "When I was around 5 years old I looked at the women around me and decided it was really dumb to be financially dependent on men. From that point on I decided I was never going to let anyone pay for my stuff and I would be independent.\n\nLittle did I know that I would consistently date men who made a lot less money than me. This has never been an issue as they did make some money and were independent but my current husband was unemployed when I met him and I really needed an assistant for my business so I hired him to work for me.\n\nHe doesn't make much and he does contribute to the house (which is mine) by doing chores and he pays for one bill which is what he can afford. The work is part-time and he has almost the entire day to focus on his career transition, which is naturally going to take some time.\n\nWhen I met him, he had very strong borderline and covert narcissistic traits and I told him about this and it took him about a couple of years to really show improvements in his understanding and controlling of these traits.\n\nwe've only been together for 3 years but i can tell you that he has grown tremendously , it's actually impressive how that suicidal little boy who didn't take responsibility for anything is now someone who never runs away from challenges and is super aware of and acting based on his true values .\n\nThe thing is, he has very toxic family and is financially dependent on the job he does for me. He has often told me that he was ready to commit suicide when we met and he's been thinking about it for a long time.\n\nHe hasn't mentioned suicide in many months but basically being that he is completely financially dependent on me and I'm a lot older than him, also, he was able to understand and manage his borderline in narcissistic traits because I'm a therapist and I explained to him how these things worked. What I'm saying is that he tells me all the time he is alive because of me.\n\nSo basically if we get divorced he has nowhere to go as he never wants to see his family again and he would probably go back to being suicidal. \n\nI don't think it's fair for me to have his life in my hands being that I have given so much of myself and taking his borderline b******* for so long. I feel that I almost don't have a choice in letting go of the relationship if it came to that because he can't go back to the life where he hated himself and everything had no money and just wanted to die.\n\nThis also affects our sex life because not only does he want it more than me, he's also much younger but I feel frustrated at how much I have to give to him to maintain the relationship and I don't want to have sex in order to maintain a man when I don't really feel like having sex.\n\nWhen he used to split and get depressed he would immediately want to have sex and it felt like I needed to regulate his emotions with my vagina. Not very sexy and also just overwhelming because I was already doing so much for him in the relationship.\n\nI'm not really satisfied with the work he does for me, but also I have a hard time training and leading as I am autistic and my mind has difficulties in engaging third parties in anything to be honest I basically just want to be left alone in my world.\n\nI did not know I was autistic when we met I got diagnosed three times afterwards.\n\nWhenever we have issues I think about how it suffocating that it won't be so easy to let go of the relationship if it came to that because of his suicidal tendencies.\n\nAnyway, I don't even know what I'm asking, I just needed to explain the situation to myself. If anyone had any insights or if anything semi useful came to mind reading this story, please let me know in the comments. Thank you so much to anyone who read up to here.",

He's done some therapy sessions when things were tough but he never had money for more. Very recently I started paying a type of health plan here in my country that will allow him to do regular therapy for very cheap. It's only become active this week but he hasn't scheduled the first session yet.",

You may not be financially dependent on a man, but you are definitely catering to someone who doesn't want to help themselves. You deserve someone who actually wants to be a better person and be a partner to you. You may need therapy to assess your own place in this relationship. Please consider yourself 1st. This man, by your own description, is bringing you down. Also, the angry sex is absolutely unacceptable. Please take care",

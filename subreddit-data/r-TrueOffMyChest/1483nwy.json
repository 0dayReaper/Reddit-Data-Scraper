    "postText": "Let's just start this for context.  As a child I had an extreme fear of death.  I know everyone goes through it. But im talking full blown panic attacks if I thought about it. That \"now I lay me down to sleep \" prayer was banned in the house as it was enough to trigger me. Eventually I thought I got passed it.\n\nMy kids (8M &amp;5F) are starting to understand their mortality.  Trying to process one day everyone dies.  Every time they bring it up the panic starts.  I'm trying to reassure them while my heart rate is going crazy, my breathing is tight, chills from head to toe. Ts been a half hour since the last episode and I still feel like I'm going to be sick.  \n\nI don\u2019t want my fear to become theirs.  I won't lie to them that it won't happen.  Both my mom and my mother in law have had major health scares recently.  My mom was diagnosed with cancer and my MIL an invasive strep infection. So I understand where their questions are coming from.  I envy people who feel secure in their beliefs about life after death. I wish I felt more capable dealing with this.  \n\nSort for the rant.",

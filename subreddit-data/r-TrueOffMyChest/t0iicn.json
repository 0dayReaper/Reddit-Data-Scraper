    "postText": "This may be my last post ever, I'm so nervous, so I'll be quick. You may have seen my previous post in this sub, it's got like 14k upvotes for now. The situation is getting so fucking worse, I don't know what to do. I am very scared, my family and friends are in danger. Russian army is going towards Kyiv, Sumy and Kherson are already occupied. SHIT I DONT KNOW WHAT TO SAY, ME AND MY FAMILY ARE JUST PACKING OUR THINGS UP, WE HEAR PLANES FLYING ABOVE ALMOST EVERY MINUTE. Many of you asked me to keep you in touch, but I'm not gonna be able to see your comments most likely.\n\nThis may be my last ever post on Reddit, so wish me luck, I think I'm gonna need it. Russians are on their way here and I am so frightened. Thanks to the people who were giving me the advices about how to behave and what things to pack, without you my family would've been left without almost any kind of useful supply. Goodbye to you all, stay safe, pray for Ukraine.",

Then there's the lawlessness that comes when authority changes hands - police probably won't be a thing for a while. Also reprisals - are you on the shit list of someone connected to whoever controls the area currently? Ever posted online against Russia or Ukraine or a guerilla force, or could you be mistaken for someone who has?\n\nThere's also risks to being caught out in the open too, so it's not a clear cut choice most of the time. \"War isn\u2019t Hell. War is war, and Hell is Hell. And of the two, war is a lot worse.\"",

She would pull me aside, take my hand in hers, and say \u201cwhenever you need me, I\u2019ll be holding your hand. All you have to do is put it out and I\u2019ll be there to hold it.\u201d\nWhen you need it today- hold out your hand! You are in my heart now and forever, you and your family. You have so many people that are holding your hand back\u2026 from all over. I promise. Stay safe, and I pray you get out of there soon.",

Even on reddit where every other post is negative to each other I see nothing but love and support for the Ukrainian people. Regardless of the nationality of posters everyone is in agreement that this should not be happening in the modern world. So what im saying is that humanity is not as bad as we believe it is, people care for other people and support each other unilaterally. Yet the government\u2019s representing people cause conflict at every step. Its time for all people to take back the power that we give to our leaders and start treating each other with respect and love as we would our neighbors and friends. All people deserve to live their lives the way we want to and not fear our neighbors because of politics. I cant remember ever in my 40 years feeling like my representatives actually represent my feelings or concerns. Lets be better to each other people, set examples and others will follow.",

Hang heavy blankets around windows and doors.\n\nPack vital items into a go-bag and make sure you know where it is at all times. Passports, ID, cash, gold jewellry/valuables, small sentimental items, medications, phone charger, laptop.\n\nElectricity may go out- charge all your devices and any backup batteries you may have. Use them as little as possible for now.\n\nKeep some flashlights and batteries in a bag or box easily accessible.\n\nKnow which of your neighbours you can trust and what skills they may have so you can help eachother.\n\nYou can often trade liquor and cigarettes for other valuable things you may need - if you have any, reserve them in case you need them.\n\nIf there is something valuable that you cannot take with you but must protect, bury it.\n\nKeep your head down, do not draw attention to yourself. If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal &amp; move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious.\n\nGet to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania. Their borders are open to refugees. Bring your passport. I don't know what sheltering as a refugee will be like with pets. A kind citizen may be able to take care of them for you temporarily if you get them across a border. Just do your best. You can only care for them &amp; your loved ones if you care for yourself first. Difficult decisions are made in times like these. ***edited to add, contacts in each of these countries have confirmed they are currently accepting refugees, no Visa required, but passport is required. Keep your passport on your person at all times, close to your body, wear a small fanny pack or belt bag under your clothes or duct tape it on your torso inside a zip lock bag or wrapped in a small cloth if you must. Desperate people may try to take one if they don't have one or can't find theirs.\n\nMessage any of us we will be checking.\n\nStay safe. It seems hollow to say it from the comfort of a country not at war but its all I can think of.\n\nMay Putin burn to dust.\n\n***edited to add - take photos of all your important documents and email them to yourself and to someone outside of fhe country if possible as well. And/or store them using a cloud service. Very important.\n\nTry to be kind to one another. Try to help others if you can. May courage be with you.\n\nAnother user posted this below and it appears to be valuable information so I will add it here as well:\n\nThis is a copy and paste and I encourage you all to do it too where appropriate! \u0428\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0456 \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0446\u0456!\n\n\u0423 \u0441\u043e\u0446\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0430\u0445 \u044f \u0447\u0443\u0432, \u0449\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0448\u0438\u0440\u044e\u044e\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0444\u0435\u0439\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0456 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438 (\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0456\u0448\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u0432\u0441\u0435, \u043f\u0456\u0434\u0442\u0440\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0456 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0454\u044e \u0442\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0456), \u0449\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d \u0437\u0430\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0439.\n\n\u0426\u0435 \u0431\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043d\u044f.\n\n\u042f\u043a\u0449\u043e \u0432\u0438 \u0448\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0454\u0442\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u2013 \u0439\u0434\u0456\u0442\u044c \u0434\u043e \u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0443. \u041c\u0438 \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0456 \u0434\u043e \u0432\u0430\u0448\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0457\u0437\u0434\u0443. \u041d\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0456 \u0433\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0456 \u043f\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043e\u043c\u0443, \u0434\u0435 \u0432\u0438 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0443\u043b\u043e\u043a, \u0457\u0436\u0443, \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0443 \u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0443 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443.\n\n\u041f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0443\u0440\u044f\u0434 \u0437\u0430\u043f\u0443\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u0441\u043f\u0435\u0446\u0456\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442, \u0449\u043e\u0431 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0442\u0438 \u0432\u0430\u043c: ua.gov.pl\n\n\u0411\u0443\u0434\u044c \u043b\u0430\u0441\u043a\u0430, \u043f\u043e\u0434\u0456\u043b\u0456\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0446\u0456\u0454\u044e \u0456\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0456\u0454\u044e, \u044f\u043a\u0449\u043e \u0432\u0438 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0454\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0441\u044c, \u0445\u0442\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0437 \u0448\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0454 \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438.\n\n\u0420\u0415\u0414\u0410\u041a\u0422\u0418\u0420\u041e\u0412\u0410\u0422\u0418: \u0412\u0410\u041c \u041d\u0415 \u041f\u041e\u0422\u0420\u0406\u0411\u041d\u0410 \u0412\u0406\u0417\u0410 \u0414\u041b\u042f \u041f\u0420\u041e\u0419\u0414\u0416\u0415\u041d\u041d\u042f \u041f\u041e\u041b\u042c\u0421\u042c\u041a\u0418\u041c \u041a\u041e\u0420\u0414\u041e\u041d\u041e\u041c. \u0412\u0421\u0415, \u0449\u043e \u0412\u0410\u041c \u041f\u041e\u0422\u0420\u0406\u0411\u041d\u041e, - \u0446\u0435 \u041f\u0410\u0421\u041f\u041e\u0420\u0422. \u0412\u0406\u0417\u0418 \u041f\u0420\u0418\u0421\u041f\u0418\u041d\u0415\u041d\u041e! \u0412\u041e\u041d\u0418 \u0412\u0410\u041c \u041d\u0415 \u041f\u041e\u0422\u0420\u0406\u0411\u041d\u0418 \u041d\u0410 \u0427\u0410\u0421!!!!!!\n\nEDIT2: \u044f\u043a \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437 \u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u0449\u043e \u0432\u0430\u043c \u0431\u0456\u043b\u044c\u0448\u0435 \u043d\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0431\u043d\u0430 \u0432\u0456\u0437\u0430:\n\n\u2022 \u2060\u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u044e\u00a0https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina---ua\u00a0\u2022\u00a0\u2060\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u044e\u00a0https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina-en\n\n\u0412\u0438\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0442\u0435, \u044f\u043a\u0449\u043e \u0446\u0435 \u0434\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044f, \u044f \u0432\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0432\n\nNote: this is for combating russian propaganda about Poland turning away Ukrainians.

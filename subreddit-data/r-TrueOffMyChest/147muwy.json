    "postText": "First attempt at 14. Two consequent ones years later. I genuinely hoped it would get better some day, but that day never came. In my 30s and it's still getting progressively worse.\n\nShitty upbringing seriously hindered growth in my early years - both physically and academically. The result is severely underachieving in career and not having any real lifelong hobbies to keep me occupied. Barely had any relationships, all of them very short lived and have ended in disaster. Stuck in a dead end job that I absolutely hate. Underpaid and barely have any savings for all the shitty years I've had to endure. No friends at all.\n\nPrior attempts at suicide failed due to the methods. I couldn't bring myself to jump off 14 stories and the toxins I took didn't seem as deadly as medical reports claimed. Now I have a revolver sitting next to me with some 38 Special Hollow Points. From what I've read a bullet to the back of the throat is one of the most effective methods.\n\nI have a pet at home and cannot let harm come to him. He's basically the only thing keeping me alive.\n\nThat's all.",

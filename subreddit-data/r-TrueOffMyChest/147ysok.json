    "postText": "I 20M Went through a terrible break up In the year 2019. I couldn\u2019t get myself for months because apparently she got pregnant for another guy and when I found out she continued to deny I didn\u2019t even tell me she slept with this guy till we broke up. \nBut what could I do? It was a long distance relationship and I expected worse from her anyways. She, let\u2019s call her Anna, Was a nice girl at the time. Even after the break up, I Still respect Her till today. All those months I thought to myself maybe I couldn\u2019t Give her all she wanted I may because she was older than me. She couldn\u2019t see any value in me and thought I wouldnt be productive. And to be honest, she may be right, That time I was 16 and couldn\u2019t fair for myself not mentioning a child. So I don\u2019t regret it, cause I could\u2019ve been worse she could\u2019ve pinned the responsibility on me or worse, yeah , she\u2019s that kind of person. She was 20 at the time and now I realized she had her whole life ahead of her. Even if we cross paths today we won\u2019t still talk to each other that I know\nCause I cut of all communication with her and blocked her on any social media platforms.\nI didn\u2019t even want her to know we\u2019re I was or even talk to me cause I didn\u2019t want anything to do with her.\nFast forward three months after the break up I met this girl and since the day I saw her I knew she would be special in my life. We exchange numbers and before you know it, she gets to calling me every single day. It was exciting cause my ex didn\u2019t prioritize me That way. She kept calling me every single day. It was annoying at first but later I got used to it and loved the care she showed and I decided to reciprocate it. Due to it being that, I started liking her our conversations started becoming awkward She later confessed to liking me, I was a little excited, but I told her I was scared to get committed again to someone again, But he said there\u2019s no reason to be scared that she wasn\u2019t going to me.\n\nWe dated in 2 years ago and I do love her a lot but she broke up with me for no valid reason, she ghosted me for 4 months, I didn\u2019t know what I did\nI did beg her to come back but she didn\u2019t even want to see me Only for me to realize she was angry over a joke I made about her legs being hairy I swr I didn\u2019t mean to hurt her, I tried to explain but she still kept ignoring me\nWe stopped talking for months until we started working in the same event center \n\nShe came back the next we started talking on WhatsApp to tell me that she wants to be friends And she had a boyfriend I still made her my friend and treated her better than her boyfriend did according to her but she never sees how much effort I put into being with her\nEven when the guy left her I still was there We talk everyday But I never imagined she\u2019d hurt me again She told me to ask her out again I did and she told me that since she got out of a toxic relationship she needs to heal and I should give her time\ntold her I\u2019d wait Dumb me got all excited that she would finally consider letting me in her life once more\nBut she went cold again I asked her what was up but she said nothing She even invited a guy over at my friends place and they hung out for hours\n\nShe even escorted him home Which she had never done for me\n\nI asked who the guy was and she said he was a friend And later said she might be interested in him\n\nShe messaged later that she was sorry and that she never saw it the way I did and that she hopes we could still talk She kept calling but i didn\u2019t pick up\nNow she tells me that she\u2019s not ready to be in a relationship.\nThen I took the first thing she said as a way to make me leave, and so we were now on talking terms until she started her mood swings\nShe talks to me today and ignores me the next But when I ignore her too she tries to get my attention one way or the other\nEven chatting with her sometimes ends us arguing cause she gives one word replies and she always doesn\u2019t accept she is gaslighting me\nalways made my intentions clear I wish she could realize how much I love her\nI did told her that one day she could wake up and realize am gone\nShe\u2019s all of a sudden happy and talks to me today then the next day she completely ignores me, or sometimes rude to me.\nShe and my mom had a fight recently and my mom resents her over it, she spoke rudely to my mom and lied in the open, as you have guessed when I confronted her about it, she got angry and started ghosting me again until I went to school and came later,\nThere we go to talking on WhatsApp again, then I mentioned that I don\u2019t want to lose her as she replies laughing, and starts confronting me over correcting her, saying, I called Her a liar, I thought to myself she was rude to my mom. Should I have Taken it lying down?\nEvil with all this I still try to apologize if I was too harsh on her when correcting her\nI still apologize several times, but she refused to listen .\nShe ended up telling me that she just wants to be my friend and nothing else, all could reply with wars no and I don\u2019t want her as a friend and we stopped communicating\nOn my birthday, she messaged me to wish me but I didnt reply\nShe did \nCall , but I pretended I didn\u2019t know who was on the line, by answering who\u2019s this\nAnd she got angry and hung up \nI felt bad for what I did cause I knew she was sensitive person and Gets moody and cries over things like that but I felt she deserved it, anyway she treated me worse than that even after I accepted to be her friend to get to know her again.",

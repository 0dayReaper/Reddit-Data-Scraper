    "postText": "Our bills card got stolen from my boyfriend 3 nights ago and $1400 was stolen from us. Then tonight, after I get done with my shift in the restaurant, I realize all my stuff is stolen. There\u2019s a camera above that only the GM can access. So we have to wait on him to look at it while he\u2019s not working. All my cards, $300 in cash, my keys, fuck even my fucking joint that I was going to enjoy after work is gone!! Everything is gone! This is after our catalytic converter was stolen and someone tried to (unsuccessfully) steal our car. This was two different occasions. Sorry for the jumble. I\u2019m just so tired and sad from losing all of my stuff. I was thinking the other day \u201cwow, isn\u2019t it nice we haven\u2019t been mugged in this big city?\u201d Just two days later and I wasn\u2019t mugged but it\u2019s gone. I\u2019m so sad and hurt.",

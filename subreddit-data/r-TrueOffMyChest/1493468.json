    "postText": "It\u2019s so fucking hard for me to wake up everyday\u2026 I wake up at 9 everyday, but I just have this physical inability to get out of bed. I have all these thoughts weighing me and I actually end up waking up at 11. I have no motivation to do things I used to love, was such an academic freak. I can\u2019t bring myself to think about that anymore. \nI can\u2019t do caffeine I get raging panic attacks from that\nI\u2019m crying myself to sleep\nI cut out sugar, I work out regularly\u2026 still the weight of my emotions is really holding me down\nMy parents are against visiting a psychiatrist because they think they are hacks who\u2019ll drug me up and honestly I kind of agree with them\nI feel so hopeless",

    "postText": "This is one of my favorite electric chair scenes of all time!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMjTOLx9O98&amp;t=46s\n\nOh my gosh, what isn't there to like? There's so many things about this scene that I love so much! The fact that it's based on the execution of the Rosenbergs! Or the mere fact that the chair in that scene is not a fake, but the actual Sing Sing Old Sparky chair which really did execute the Rosenbergs just 30 years prior. Old Sparky himself was relocated to Green Haven Prison in the seventies after New York had abolished the death penalty, but he was transported back to Sing Sing for the scene. I love the sounds of those straps tightening, crunching as Old Sparky firmly embraces his prey. It's almost as if he's giving them a tight hug, and it's oddly romantic, in a way. Imagine being the actor sitting in that chair knowing that between 1891 and 1963, 614 people perished in his lap.\n\nI love the part where they show a close up of the rubber backrest. I like the studs on the sides, and the gooseneck pattern on it. I love the loud creaking sound as it is being adjusted forwards (so as to prevent any grounding, not for inmate comfort). It's one of the very last things that happen before the lethal current is turned on!\n\nAnother thing I really love about that scene is the detail of the electric chair's engine - his generator. You can hear it at this part of the scene https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMjTOLx9O98&amp;t=119s it sounds like a jet engine whirring up! That sound was an actual recording of the electric chair's generator at Sing Sing - it was the very last thing that 614 people heard before Old Sparky sent his fatal juice straight through their bodies, up and down, at 60 hertz.\n\nI've lost track of how many times I've watched that scene and I've got it saved onto my computer. My other favorite scene is the one from Lonely Hearts, which also depicts the Sing Sing chair (though it was a replica) and a real life event. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJkqNju93Vw\n\nI just love how scared he is of Old Sparky, he really doesn't want to be hugged by him! I also love the part at this mark https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJkqNju93Vw&amp;t=117s where you can see the ticklish electrical current tickling his diaphragm, causing spasms and sounds similar to laughter! I like this detail, as it is believed that the electric chair actually kills a person through asphyxiation in most cases, and there is even some evidence to suggest the alternating nature of the electric current tickles (Willie Francis is the only survivor of the electric chair, 'Gruesome Gertie' - the chair was not set up properly, and Francis failed to die. When asked what he felt like he said that it had tickled him. His execution was rescheduled a year later, and this time Gruesome Gertie killed him.)",

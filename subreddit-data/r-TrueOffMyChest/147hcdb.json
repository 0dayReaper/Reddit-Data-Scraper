    "postText": "So, it's been a month since my boss started joking about not hiring young females, who could possible have a wish for children, because they need to compensate for me. \n\nI did talk it over with my direct colleagues and they too were completely stunned when she made that statement.\n\nI ended up reporting her to the confidential person at work. As it turns out, my boss was in hot waters about problems in our team last year too, so they were not surprised when I contacted them about her. \n\nThe exact words when I requested a meeting was: \"is this about Mary?\"\n\nIt's been a month, and while I have received an update that \"a solution is in the making\", my boss has made several other remarks pointed directly at me. \n\nI have now completely lost all joy I once had in my job and I only keep going because of my colleagues. \n\nI am however applying to different job openings right now. I can not imagine staying here. Even is it turns out the solution they are working on is firing her. The job market is big right now, so I don't doubt I'll find something else soon. I just feel bad abandoning my coworkers. For now, I am still working while I'm looking for a job, but I'm hopeful it won't be long anymore. \n\nI might take a day or 2 of next week, just te get a little break for Mary and to recharge my batteries. I'm really bad at pretending, so I'm sure they know something is up. \n\n\nTl;dr: made a formal complaint against my boss, a solution is being worked on, but I'm still looking for a different job.",

            "comment": "You're not from Germany, are you? Because these laws sound awfully familiar \ud83d\ude02\n\nComing from someone working in HR: employees on maternatiy leave are not that dramatic and your boss is absolutely in the wrong for what she said. It's definitely discriminating against young women (\"im geb\u00e4rf\u00e4higen Alter\")\n\nIt doesn't souns like you're working for a small family business but a bigger company - yeah, paying 14 weeks of maternity leave is no fun but it's substituted by the state afaik. And you came back right after that instead of going on parental leave (dang, how do you manage that with a baby at home? :0 /gen), so it's as if you had been on an extended sickness period and you'll pick up right where you left. \n\nAdditionally, if a woman IS absent for a longer period of time because of maternity leave + parental leave, you usually get a replacement - it's that easy. You can even hire them for a limited amount of time, i. e. the date the mother comes back after parental leave. And you can still decide then, if you can carry another employee on the budget or not \n\nAnd even then. Yes, those are admittedly thibgs that employers need to keep in mind and plan with. So having it on your mind as a boss is not too bad. But you don't take that out on your employees and you also don't straight up throw it in their face because it's not their problem and you have no reason to be offended by a woman pursuing a family\n\nWe had a new boss last year that walked herself out the door (partially, there were other issues with her too) with smth like this. She expressed her dislike towards young woman in leading posituons because they could get pregnant. Mind you, she said that in front of a 6/8 female manager team, 4 of which are newly married and in their 20s-30s. Two more months and she was thrown out for her inappropriate comments and some other stuff. Luckily, she was still on probation so it was easy. \n\nAnyway, this became a longer comment than expected xD\nGood luck with your new job! Keep in touch with the colleagues you value and see what opportunities are awaiting you! :3",

I just came out of a meeting where again I got comments about my 'slacking off' because I said I couldn't put a face to someone's name (hey, we are working remotely, she does not come into the office on the same day I do and I have been absent. Also, I'm just generally bad with faces. Couldn't describe my sister if I wanted to.)  To be fair, I am ready to put in my notice this very second, it is really weighing on me mentally.",

Stand strong for the time remaining and I'm sure you'll instantly feel relief once you signed a new contract and put in your notice. Again, best of luck to you! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc9e",

    "postText": "So yesterday it finally happened. My wife of 8 years caught me cheating and we ended up having a huge fight. I never saw it as a big deal, I told her she\u2019s overreacting but all she seems to think is that I\u2019ve broken to most important thing in a marriage which is trust. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since we got married and even a little bit before, I never considered it wrong. \n\nShe\u2019s still mad about it and staying with her parents, we can barely have a conversation without her telling me I\u2019m \u201cgaslighting\u201d her. She\u2019s said straight up she wants a divorce and I just think it\u2019s such a big overreaction. I told her it was just a game of UNO but she doesn\u2019t care. Anyone have any advice?",

Shame level &gt; 9000, public defeat :(  \nUPDATE #2: I think OP cheated. Something's fishy about how my reverse card randomly went missing in the last 30 seconds of the match. I DEMAND A REMATCH!\n\n\n----\n\nIf you have any specific questions about this removal, please [message the moderators](https://www\\.reddit\\.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FTrueOffMyChest&amp;subject=about my removed submission&amp;message=I'm writing to you about the following submission: https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/t3ja7i/-/. %0D%0DMy issue is...).

It may be a bit scary at first but Uno with 3,4 or even 5 people can be quite exciting!",

Imagine the whole game actually only spans the time it takes to fire off the 20 shots (it's been a minute, idk) or so it takes to end a game. \n\nAlternatively, give your enemy credit that even if both your ships are all moving, you really do have a better idea of where theirs are *and where they're headed* once you've found them.",

    "postText": "My (20F) friend died 2 years ago from brain cancer at 20 years old. We weren\u2019t even friends really, just in the same friend group so I saw him a lot. His ex girlfriend and I (they were still friends) got really close right before his death. She dated him almost all of high school and were best friends above all. The only reason they broke up was because he moved away for school. She moved on quickly and cheated on him multiple times before he left because she\u2019s a codependent person. \n\nAnyways..he wrote my friend a letter before he died. In it, he expressed his regret for moving away from her. He talked about memories they had together, which made us both cry. He told her that he loves her more than he\u2019s ever loved anyone before and is sad that he\u2019ll never get married. But what really stuck with me was him saying \u201cI don\u2019t want to die and I\u2019m scared\u201d. I\u2019m also haunted by the way my friend handled this situation. I chalked it up to a strange reaction to grief at the time and supported her wholly. She only saw him before he died because I made her and went with her(at this point he was in bad shape), she was very late to his funeral because she was dying her hair, and when his mom reached out(who paid for many of her expenses in high school bc her parents are neglectful) many times but she never spoke to his mom. \n\nI\u2019m haunted that I watched this boy\u2019s last moments involve loving someone who didn\u2019t love him anymore and how lonely and afraid he was.",

I feel so weird that it still bothers me since we weren\u2019t even that close. I have no prob shitting on dead people, so you know I mean it when I say he was a gentle soul and the smartest person I\u2019ve ever met. Thanks for reading",

It might be healing to reach out to her and let her know that you\u2019re thinking of her and remember her son fondly. I did that for the mom of an old friend of mine who passed and I\u2019m glad I did, I felt weird about it bc he and I hadn\u2019t talked for years but she was so grateful.\n\nAlso, it might be helpful for you to search up stories about people\u2019s near death experiences. There\u2019s tons of them online and they are so cool. The vast majority of people experience total peace and acceptance. I\u2019m sure your friend did too.",

I do know she has a lot of support because she\u2019s just as kind as he was. I guess I just worry that I\u2019m reopening a wound by messaging her (even though I\u2019m sure she already thinks about it nonstop). \nI may look into near death experiences when I\u2019m feeling a little calmer, perhaps it will help me with my own fear of death.",

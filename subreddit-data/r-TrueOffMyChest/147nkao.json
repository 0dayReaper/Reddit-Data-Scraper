I miss him terribly and I can\u2019t seem to think that the happiness I knew as being his mom will ever return to me. I feel empty, lost and mostly heartbroken.  I will miss him forever.",

I am so sorry for your loss \ud83d\udc94\n\n\"There is a cycle of love and death that shapes the lives of those who choose to travel in the company of animals. It is a cycle unlike any other. To those who have never lived through it's turnings or walked its rocky path, our willingness to give our hearts with full knowledge that they will be broken seems incomprehensible. Only we know how small a price we pay for what we receive; our grief, no matter how powerful it may be, is an insufficient measure of the joy we have been given.\"\n\nWhiskey's Wish",

It never gets easier and I still miss each of them. \n\nHowever the pain will ease with time, and you will soon remember the happy times and smile thinking about them. \n\nI still love poppy, sandy, Ben and molly (my four who I said goodbye to) and I often talk about them to my daughter. We have Toby now and he doesn\u2019t replace them, but we love him all the same. \n\nPlease take care buddy, know that you aren\u2019t alone and people will listen and be there for you.",

Hunting dogs do like to run. \n\nOne day you will be able to say your pups name with fond, beautiful memories. You will always miss him, like a good mom. Take care of yourself!",

    "postText": "Hi all. Firstly I would like to thank you all so much for your kind words and messages. Thank you for your support and validation, your words meant so much to me. Also, i thought I would explain the whole \"i hope you all miraculously wake up with more money in your bank account\" comment. I heard someone in tiktok say this and thought it would be a nice thing to say as some people did question it in my messages. But yeah thank you all again. \n\nBefore this update starts I would like to say that this all occurred like two weeks ago now. I just reached my breaking point and needed to vent. Hence why the update may be soon to some, this won't be the final update. But an update. \n\nI would also like to clear the air with my parents. Now unfortunately, my parents come from a country where this stuff is normal. Bot only that but I am partially to blame as I didn't say anything. Eventually I did tell them and they tried their best to help me. But they didn't know how. Though I do acknowledge their efforts, I am still going to be taking time to heal from them as well. My entire family also had a go at them and expressed their disappointment. The best thing for now is for me to spend some time apart from them. \n\nSo to begin. I left the school. After my parents had heard that I got into trouble seriously because of troy again, they basically thought it was time to pull me out. I am due to start my new school in two weeks. I have also been trying to settle at my grandma's house as I just needed a fresh start with fresh people. To be honest, I have never felt so free. I have had to deal with that torment for years and years. So now I can enjoy the pleasure of walking home and not seeing him or bumping into him. So I feel great.\n\nOnto the serious stuff:\nAs I had mentioned, my family basically decided to pay for a lawyer, and we are now hoping to have a lawsuit against basically everyone involved. My grandma also had a go to put nicely with the school's board for basically allowing nepotism to harass other girls. She called all of the teachers a disgrace for endangering not only me but other people and saying how none of the teachers who allowed this deserve to even step foot into a school. \n\nThis experience has also not been all sunshines and daisies. After the suit was claimed or made (idk) my parents got letters and messages basically asking for the case to be dropped. My parents obviously said no. But it still didn't stop the harassment. I eventually got harassed too. All of the people giving me death threats decided to go into graphic detail on what troy wanted to do to me. Spoiler, it wasn't great. And Troy's parents showed up on my doorstep demanding to see me and talk to me and how troy is ready to apologise. Thankfully by then my uncle and I had been on the way to my grandma's house. However, my parents obviously didn't let them in regardless and said that if they want to communicate it had to be through a lawyer. \n \nThe harassment didn't stop. And eventually troy sent me a message on a burner account detailing all of the things he was going to do if \"got the opportunity to\" and that I should be grateful that I managed to walk away with \"just a groping\". Troy also kept spewing on about how I am nothing but a whore or slut etc. And I should be grateful someone so popular even looked my way. He kept saying how if I had just let him *fck* me, he wouldn't have groped me. However, I know if I did that I would no longer be myself. I would be his property forever. The thought of that makes me want to vomit. Also his logic doesn't make sense to me. \n\nAnyway, I just got receipts and blocked him. I also asked my parents to help me change my number. And I did. My grandma being the person she is decided that wasn't good enough and got me a whole new phone. She claims it's compensation for my trauma. Thanks grandma. I am starting therapy the day after tomorrow and I am hoping to start family therapy in August as truthfully, I don't know if I am mad at my parents or should be mad. Like is it my fault for not saying anything? \n\nBut that's all the update I can give you for now. The lawsuit will be a whole other process and hopefully if I remember I can update you all again. Thank you so much for your words. I truly appreciate all of you. I hope this update is clear enough for you and apologises if you made it this far lol.",

It'll further bury him into the fucking grave he has already made. \n\n2. Keep a log of any time you are asked for at home by his parents or by anyone else on their behalf. \n\nAs someone who was harrassed as well, these 2 things alone are what I had in reserve as weapons that put my harasser down for good.\n\nLuckily for me, just me accounting all the harrassing and constant contact they were making at me was enough to get an order of protection, which got them into jail when they broke it.",

Maybe even a few more cheap ones around other rooms if just one is suspicious. They\u2019d be justified to do so due to all the threats.

As in, would the posted signage and anyone still choosing to step onto the property essentially be giving consent to being filmed? \n\nI think OP and their family need it just in case of both escalation and continuation of the harassment anyway, but this way it can be used in court for sure.",

For example, if your back yard borders a park or golf course, that doesn't give you the right to record private conversations just because you can hear them from your property. If you have a camera *inside* your house then it's a little more lenient but still could be considered surreptitious. \n\nAnother good example, if you have a dash camera that records audio it may be illegal in your state to not inform your passengers, even though it's your car.",

If you have a camera in a reasonable spot, such as overlooking your backyard, and a conversation could be heard through that then it is case/judge dependent on whether or not that conversation could be construed as a private conversation due to the location. \n\nFor example on a golf course you might be able to claim it as private, however if you live somewhere that backs up to a road/alley or any other area that\u2019s considered public space then it wouldn\u2019t be considered a private conversation. \n\nFew things to note is that a conversation within an enclosed space, such as a car, you have a reasonable expectation of privacy. If you\u2019re walking and talking down a sidewalk then you do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. The major key is whether or not a judge decides whether or not your conversation was held in a space with a reasonable expectation of privacy. The judge will decide that whilst evidence is being submitted which is why you hear the term that \u201cX\u201d was tossed out of court.",

Unfortunately, schools surprisingly don\u2019t care about the welfare of their students, as you\u2019ve now discovered the hard way.\n\nMy parents did a lot of the same as yours, going to the head, speaking to the people in charge of the school and even the police. Even after a very serious assault had happened they just couldn\u2019t give a fuck. They tried their best to sweep everything under the rug and drag their heels, much like in your case. \n\nThe second my mother said she was going to speak to the regional newspaper about it HOLY SHIT did they change their tone. They still could have done more but it was at that point they started taking it seriously which is honestly quite sad. It really is sad but it\u2019s a life lesson. \n\nJust keep it in mind. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already thought of it but I\u2019m verifying that it works. You shouldn\u2019t have to but they should\u2019ve looked after you. Going to the news or threatening it is one way to get people to do something. Because deep down they know it\u2019s wrong. Sorry you had to go through that and hope you settle in to the new school.",

There was once a very similar man only threatened to SA me (he was big enough that he probably could have on his own) and that DID NOT fly with him. He immediately shut it down, called other staff in to help with the client and he wasn't allowed to be on his own or allowed near the girls for a long while. And even then, he was still supervised 100%.\n\nWhat the school did to you was not right at all. It was absolutely wrong and them asking you to drop it is a good indicator that they know it too.\nI am so sorry that happened to you and I wish you nothing but the best.

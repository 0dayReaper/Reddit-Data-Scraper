    "postText": "I used to be addicted to porn. Increasing the \u201chardcore\u201d nature of it gradually over the years, eventually until it became so bad nothing did it anymore. NOTHING could get me hard, so I didn\u2019t even masturbate for a few weeks. Then, it happened. Women became absolutely irresistible. If I\u2019m not having sex with atleast one woman a week I\u2019m not happy. So far I have three. I can not stop. I want to stop. I have no control over my primal, innate desires. I can not stop sleeping with women, and I can not even watch porn anymore. I\u2019d prefer to watch porn. I don\u2019t hurt anyone\u2019s feelings that way. But I can\u2019t. I\u2019m only able to sleep with women. Task failed successfully.",

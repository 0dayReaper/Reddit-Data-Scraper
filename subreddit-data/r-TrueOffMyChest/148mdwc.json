He said to work on my tone, he feels like I put him down the way I talk to him vs the way I talk to other people. He thinks I talk to him like he is stupid, but this is never something I used to do.\n\nSo\u2026.thoughts? Obviously these issues are a major concern to him and me as well but I can\u2019t help but feeling put off by the fact he thinks I am overconfident recently. I noticed it as well, would attribute some of it to big wins at work. Did Reddit make me this way? Are we both just overthinking it?",

    "postText": "i have a long history of mental health struggles, and for the past year ive hardly been able to get myself out of bed, much less attend classes or do my class work. because of this, i moved back home with my parents for spring term. i dont think school is a good fit for me right now and i want to tell my parents but i dont know how to without disappointing them. i already took a gap year due to my mental state and have been struggling with my courses since. the issue lies in the fact that my parents pay for my school, so i know they are going to be really angry. i already got a job at a pizza place close to their house and am supposed to start tomorrow, but they dont even know i was job hunting. i want to tell them that im going to pay them back for this last term and start saving some money to maybe get an estheticians license in the fall. i dont know how to start the conversation. im sorry for the stream of consciousness brain dump; im just really confused and anxious about how to go about this.",

            "comment": "Yeah they're gonna be pissed. Probably should have consulted with them ahead of this year- but also if it's that bad.... I'm surprised they didn't see this coming. Also if you can get a job at a pizza place and you can go for your esthetician's license and go into that field, you can do school work- I think you know yourself better than anybody, but there's something to be said for your folks inevitably being pissed at you for giving up and wasting their money.\n\nI'm not saying you're the ass hole or a bad person or anything like that- just that this is a worst case scenario- you really think you can pay them back for college tuition with pizza parlor money? Have you calculated how long that'd actually take? \n\nI understand it feels good to make some money right now, but again if you can handle the pressures of a job- and this is assuming you can do that- you can handle the pressures of school.\n\nDo you have learning disabilities? Would you simply rather not do academics? How much would you have to pay them back vs how much would you make at these jobs? Also receiving training, qualifying for and getting your esthetician license can also cost time and money- similar to college and college tuition payments.",

I don't regret that I did it.\n\nI DO regret that I didn't save more over a shorter period of time and walk away from the business sooner to pursue my real goals earlier, but it's also kinda worked out for the best the way it all played out in reality, so that's a long winded way of saying our paths in life are often the correct one if we find our happiness and our purpose.\n\nIf this choice gives you more happiness and purpose, do it.",

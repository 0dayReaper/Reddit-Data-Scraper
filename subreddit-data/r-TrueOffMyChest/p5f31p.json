    "postText": "Elon Musk is not the founder of PayPal. He is not the founder of Tesla either. Hyperloop is a stupid idea. None of his \"ideas\" are revolutionary. His entire aesthetic is fake futurism with no substance. His plans of colonizing Mars are overstated at best, and fraudulent at worst. He is not \"self-made\". From Palcohol to Neuralink to Starship, he has no grasp of basic science. Not to mention how inflated the stock prices of Tesla are. Every person interested in science has been enamored by Musk at one point, but we can't be fooled any longer. I wish his fanboys would stop and do some research.\n\nEdit: I don't care about defenders of capital in the replies",

They couldn't decide between two different styles of keyboard because they thought both worked best in different circumstances, so they built both and added a button to swap between them. When they demoed this to Jobs he immediately asked Ken which he preferred and simply said they should use that keyboard alone, because he understood that the small amount of added utility by having a second style of keyboard was easily outweighed by the added complexity of having both. Not just for end users to have to switch between, but for their designers and developers to have to consider. That's the kind of shit Jobs excelled at, just cutting through the bullshit and making clear decisions that made their products better for users and better for their employees to work on.",

That being said, his family certainly wasn't poor by any stretch of the imagination. His father was a real estate consultant. They owned multiple houses. Elon went to a prestigious private school. \n\nElon's dad did provide some of the startup capital for Elon's first business. It is unclear who exactly provided the rest of the money, but it is very possible his family connections helped secure the initial investment. Elon did work hard at his first business, no doubt about that, but I think we can pretty confidently say that he would not be where he is today if he did not come from a privileged background.",

In fact, it's super common in the industry to work at Tesla/SpaceX for 1-3 years then jump ship. It's a great resume booster.",

So for example, if a helmet fell off a shelf and hit your head.  It would be ironic that something designed to protect your head, injured your head.\n\nOr if I was to say \"I'm going to take up running because I will be healthier and live longer\", but then get hit and killed by a car while out running.\n\nEDIT: **People are assuming Alanis meant that it's ironic the song isn't ironic.  However in interviews I've read, she said she never thought about what the word meant and she gets a lot of hate from people who say nothing is ironic in the song and it made her hate it.

And it was only being accelarated by musk.\n\nYeah no if Dieselgate taught us anything it's that car manufacturers care about profits, and that it is profitable to pollute. Car manufacturers would have done nothing more than the bare minimum compliance cars, and keep proclaiming that the demand wasn't there, that good BEVs couldn't be done, that the technology wasn't good enough. It's not like anyone could provide any alternatives after all.\n\nThen Tesla came around and showed that for the lies they were, and lit a fire under the ass of car manufacturer CEOs. \n\nThe development of BEVs was not at all going forward, it was actively being hindered both by car manufacturers and by oil companies. It's only after Tesla showed up that everyone else started being serious about BEVs, because they never needed to be serious about it before. They could just lie through their teeth and we'd be forced to go along with it.\n\n&gt;And with launch of blue origin and virgin Galactic we can see musk is far ahead of the competition.\n\nOh for sure. This is again though evidence that Musk is doing *something* right, and that he is most certainly not a fraud, a hack, and an uneducated moron like so many people on this thread seem to think he is. He absolutely could be a narcissistic asshole, but at least he seems to be an *efficient* asshole, which is what everyone seems only too happy to forget to mention.\n\n&gt;Fun fact one of my uncle and his friends make electric car for there final engineering project. (It took them like 4 months tops).\n\nOh nice that's pretty cool!",

Personally, I think he is less greedy than you make him out to be though I'm certainly not a fan of his and disagree with him more than I agree with him. Obviously I think Tesla is way overvalued.",

I'm not super crazy about the corporate groveling that happens around him, but without Tesla, Ford Chevy and GMC wouldn't be making electric cars at nearly the same rate as they are now. He's making valuable inroads into 'future' tech. I would say that I'm not amazingly impressed with Space X, and I wish he was just working on a giant 'de-carbonizer' of the atmosphere instead, but he's better than most rich guys.\n\nEdit: Ok, ok, ok.\n\n1. That's very cool he has prize money for a carbon removal system. I didn't know that, BUT, why not just be actively researching this tech if you are the richest guy in the world? How are rocket ships helping our environment? \n\n\n2. I'm impressed with what Space X has achieved, but I don't understand the long term goal. Besides launching starlink satellites up, do we really think that jet propulsion systems are going to effectively ferry humans to other star systems? I don't know, I may be a little confused, but we are extremely far off from terraforming Mars and I just don't know what the goal is in creating a fleet of rocket ships right now. And I know this last part sounds crazy, but shouldn't he also be trying to figure out what the hell those tic tac space ships are that the navy keeps chasing?",

No. \n\n&gt; Hyperloop is a stupid idea \n\nThanks for the insight, you say people blindly love Elon, but that\u2019s not true.

You calling him a fraud for that when we\u2019ll have a man on the moon this decade as well (due to SpaceX) is no different than people who thought it was impossible to land on the moon in the 60s.\n\n&gt; He has no grasp of basic science.\n\nI\u2019ve watched his interviews, he fully understands what\u2019s going on. His engineers and scientist literally inform him. He\u2019s one person with multiple scientific companies, do you really think he\u2019s a fucking brain surgeon while being the CEO of Neuralink? Grow up\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nHe\u2019s the owner of SpaceX, of course he takes credit for that but he praises his engineers **all the time**\n\nYou hate him because he\u2019s ambitious, but NASA wouldn\u2019t give their moon contract to a \u201cfraud\u201d. Do you really think most people who like Elon don\u2019t know he came from privilege? We fucking do, but how is that relevant at all? We just like that there\u2019s someone who is pushing the boundaries for once\n\nElon Musk haters are so **fucking annoying**, Jeff Bezos is far worse and came from far more wealth. And is doing the exact same thing, every single billionaire is basically just as bad. But you people fixate on Elon as if his accomplishments mean nothing because he has employees that did most of the work for him. News flash, the engineers he hired did the engineering \n\n**Sorry he couldn\u2019t design, engineer, and build his rockets himself like your favorite fucking sci-fi film and the child-like depictions you forced on him were only in your head. Only to realize he\u2019s human as you got older. Grow the fuck up**\n\nAnd what\u2019s worse is that you feel so justified in your hate and people here will agree with you blindly because it\u2019s natural to hate billionaires. But they aren\u2019t agreeing with you for the right reasons. \n\nI\u2019ll take my downvotes now, if we criticized Elon for the rights reasons I\u2019d happily agree.

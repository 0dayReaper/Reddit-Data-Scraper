    "postText": "I\u2019m getting married to the love of my life this year. Like plenty of people growing up, I\u2019ve dreamed of my wedding. I always expected for my dad to hand me off on that day, but instead I cut him out. \n\nThere\u2019s many reasons we got to this point today. I don\u2019t want to go to far into detail in fear of the people I know reading it. My mom and him divorced a few years ago due to his never ending infidelity. The last person he cheated on her with was a doozy for the whole family. Tore everyone apart. I still see red when I hear the woman\u2019s name. \n\nThis situation is one where I hate both of the cheaters and place blame on both, due to them both fully aware of what they were doing. One having known me since I was pretty much born and the other knowing me since I was a child. (Dad is not bio dad, but still dad nonetheless). \n\nPreparing for my upcoming wedding has honestly been blissful. But as I\u2019m putting together who is walking with who and when, my heart broke. Knowing that I\u2019m not walking with my dad hurts a bit, but I truly don\u2019t want him in my life. My mother is walking me down the isle instead, where she deserves to be. She is an angel and my best friend. \n\nA few months ago I finally cut ties off with my dad. Tired of being the middle man in arguments, tired of being his pawn to get info on my siblings. I finally said enough was enough with the incredible support and words from my fianc\u00e9. And he has almost left me alone. I say almost because he never truly leaves me alone. He does not understand boundaries, always has to be his way or the highway. So instead of engaging I ignore him, leave him on read, etc. after years of trying to find solutions with him and stroking his ego. \n\nI don\u2019t honestly know if I\u2019m sad because of him or sad that that my wedding isn\u2019t like the one I\u2019ve dreamt up. I stand firm on wanting him not a part of my life, but it hurts that it ever got here. That I even had to make this decision. \n\nI don\u2019t want advice on how to solve things with him. I have forgiven him for what he has done but I\u2019m not forgetting what he was put me through. I\u2019ve been through years of therapy since, I do not want to solve this. I just needed to get this off my chest.",

            "comment": "I also cut ties with my father years ago. Back when he was with my mother he was violent and manipulative. Hit her, threw stuff at me and her. He also refuses to take any responsibility for my upbringing after that. My mother did it all by herself. I saw him again a few months ago and he was still treating the woman he married after my mother like shit. \n\nThe worst thing is my sister has 2 kids and sometimes even leaves the oldest one with him to babysit. I dont understand how you can be the living proof he cant take care of children, yet still leave your children with him.\n\nAnyways, all this to say i feel you. Rather none than him, but still stings not having a father figure.",

I hope he treats those babies well. May we find family and live in those around us. Have a great day, thank you so much for your response.",

            "comment": "Not in a dissimilar boat. I cut my dad off a few years ago when his verbal and emotional abuse (as well as some shady sexual practices) resulted in a months-long custody case for my younger sister that he was able to brute force for so long that my mom ended relenting and letting him have some legal rights over her. It was a horrible situation that tore the family part, and I hold him entirely responsible. \n\nHe's definitely never been a present dad, meaning most of my childhood was subsumed by looking for a replacement father figure. Unfortunately, we also moved a lot (as in eighteen schools in eighteen years a lot), so while I have been very lucky to have had valuable and important relationships with male mentors, I've simply never had the chance to the connect with someone deeply. I've been contemplating getting married recently (I have a wonderful bf who I have no doubt I will one day marry) and have had this melancholic feeling knowing there is no father or father-like figure I would want to walk me down the aisle. It almost feels like grieving the life and childhood I never had. Those people who say you can't miss what you never had are flat-out wrong when it comes to some things, and this is one of them. This is, or should be, a formative and life-defining experience, and doing it without this one symbol is symbolic unto itself--a reminder of painful experiences and all the reasons not to have him. \n\nI'm glad your mom is walking you down the aisle. I hope her stepping in can be healing for you.",

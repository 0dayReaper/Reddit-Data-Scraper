    "postText": "I (35m) and my partner (29F) were getting ready for initmate time after putting the kids to bed. Our schedules were really conflicting for good long while, and previous attempts to get together for this intimate time weren't successful. I struggle a lot with rejection disphoria because I had a previous partner (38F)  that would go all out on getting ready for it, and then when we got in bed and undressed for intimate time, would say no and go straight to sleep almost every time. It's difficult for me to get out of my own head sometimes. And people are free to change their mind at ANY point, but it turns out later my partner was diagnosed as Narcissistic and BPD by her psychologist, and part of her treatment was an apology to me. So before me and my current partner began I said I was feeling this rejection emotions from the past week, and really needed to address them, and that I just need a Yes I want to from her just some active encouragement from her as I was struggling with my head and heart. She said \"Yes.\" I said I understand that but I really need more than just that at moment. I was told Yes we can. I wasn't up for it earlier today though, but I'm up for it now. I told her again I understand you are up for it, but in the past we have had intimate time when you weren't into it, didn't want it, but were \"up for it\". I need to know you want it. I was told \"why isn't a yes good enough? What do you want? I don't understand. I can't be enthusiastic it's not who I am.\" I said I'm not asking her to change into sexy clothes, or dim the light, or do music or candles, just to touch me, my face my hair, my back. To kiss me, to just show me she is into it. She said that isn't how she is, and tes is always been good enough before. I said I feel like I'm having to justify my feelings, and my request for just a little reassurance. She stared at me for a long while, after ten minutes of silence and no reaction I said  I love you, I'm sorry for bothering you with this. I got ready and left to go drink a couple beers by myself before coming home.\n\nI feel like I'm crazy for wanting more than just consent, to feel like I'm wanted and desired.",

You specifically told me exactly what you needed, but I don't understand what you need or why.\" Maybe it's just me internalizing things and overthinking too. But I'm trying to not constantly intellectualize my emotions and actually feel them.",

You are the man I assume. The man is tough, resilient, capable, strong, courageous and brave. That is in a deep part of man that is not in the biology of others. Find that primal part of you and unlock it. Stand tall and fight through whatever tough time you are having. If you genuinely love this women which it seems you do then just love her. Your unwavering love despite the fact she may not be meeting your needs will wash its force over her and even over yourself. It will unlock the love inside her and she will give you that love in return. I promise.",

    "postText": "My dreams can be very realistic and long. One time my dream lasted 27 years (usually they are much shorter tho). It ended with me being killed during my 27th birthday party. That was a whole life i lost. I dream a lot and many times i had dreams within dreams. Many times i woke up when I started questioning if i was asleep or not but not always. Recently I constantly have this feeling something is off and my mind way too often goes to \u201cis this a dream?\u201d. Also because my dreams are so realistic i sometimes confuse then for real memories. I think after some time i can differentiate what really happened and what didn\u2019t but how can i be certain?",

            "comment": "Wow, that\u2019s actually pretty special. I study dreams and my advice would be to try and work with them. As soon as you open your eyes in the morning, write down (or type in your phone) every detail of the dreams that you can remember. You can learn a lot about what your subconscious mind is trying to tell you by googling the meaning behind various aspects of your dreams. For example people who are in a stressful, out of control situation in life often dream of being in a speeding car they can\u2019t properly drive or with brakes that don\u2019t work. \n\nBut meanings aside, just the act of starting the day by writing out your dreams will help you create a clearer distinction between waking and dreaming time. And side note, there\u2019s a lot of fun things you can do with dreams (like lucid dreaming and astral projection) that might be easier for you than most:)",

Now i write down like 1 in 7 and since I wasn\u2019t doing it frequently lucid dreams stopped. I will try do it more often. \n\nThis thing about meanings that you wrote about is interesting. When i had dreams that I felt like they meant something i did search on internet for an explanation but I usually wasn\u2019t satisfied with results. Do you have a good website for it?",

I\u2019ve only managed it twice and both times I woke up as soon as I realized lol. \n\n[AuntyFlo](https://www.auntyflo.com) is probably my favorite, it has a massive amount of dream interpretations and usually has a few possible meanings for each one, depending on context.",

It sometimes helped and after a while I could stay in a dream and try to change it a little or just truly be in control of myself- like it\u2019s just a dream i can do whatever i want, but i only had this mindset when i was 100% sure i was dreaming.",

    "postText": "Remember my shit show of a post from awhile back? Well, here\u2019s the long awaited update. Since our dinner chat we had, all of our lives have been so much better. My wife suffered with PPD after she had him and I really do think it\u2019s effected her since. She would go into a depressive episode when she would see him doing great things not knowing the truth. Lifting this burden off her really brought back her true self and the woman I fell in love with when we were teenagers. She\u2019s happy and smiley. No longer has to take any medications and can look at posts from my sister of him and be happy for them. \n\nNow, the part everyone was waiting for. His badass car he was working on. He finished it in April and I couldn\u2019t of been more proud to see him drive it home. He worked his ass off to finish it and it brought a tear to my eye seeing how happy he was after and how much he loves this car. \n\nWe started a new tradition. Every Friday, we all eat dinner together. Even if it\u2019s sitting in the car together at sonic or a home cooked meal.\n\nI mentioned his wonderful girlfriend in my update post too. That girlfriend has turned into his future wife! They got engaged a couple months ago. He planned our Friday dinner at a restaurant where he proposed to her. He texted me the other day that planning a wedding is weird having two moms and a dad. His fianc\u00e9e asked if I would walk her down the isle since her parents refuse to show up since they don\u2019t have a good relationship with her. I bawled like a baby when she asked me that. \n\nSo, our happy little confusing family has only grown stronger and making more memories. I still do not regret my decision at all.",

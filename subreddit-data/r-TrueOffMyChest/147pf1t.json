    "postText": "I (34f) live in the UK, and in April I was served a section 21, meaning the landlord of the home I've lived in with my kids (16f and 13m) for the past 7 years wants the house back. It's nothing I did, I've never been behind or late in my payments, I've never had drama or major issues, he just can't afford to keep me here at the rent I'm currently paying with mortgage rates changing, and I can't afford the amount he wants to raise the rent to. Fair enough, I'm not bitter or resentful, it's his house. \n\nStarted looking for other places straight away. This is my third private rental and I've always walked in, signed on, moved in. This time I just get ghosted or outright told no. Why? Because I'm on benefits. My money isn't good enough. I was born with a genetic time bomb that went off in 2018, right as I'd finished my master's degree (art and design), so I'm full-time physically disabled. My condition is incurable and mostly untreatable, as well as degenerative. I've gone from a woman who could deadlift 90kg to some bleak shell of myself who now needs stairlifts and a scooter, but that's a whole other sob story. \n\nSome landlords ask for a guarantor, which I can't provide. My family live in my country of origin, and before anyone asks why I don't go back, I tried in 2014 and was told NO by a British court of law. \n\nCurrently in talks with the council about being made homeless and the first thing I'm told every time is that I don't have to go anywhere, I can wait till landlord takes me to court. Like, wtf? Why would I want that? It's his house, it's inevitable he'll win and I'd incur costs.\n\n Second option they suggest is I move in with a friend and one has offered, but she has five kids and various animals, meaning our presence would make the whole thing even more chaotic.\n\n Third option is one room in a B&amp;B in a city I've never lived in, and where I'd be stuck as I can't drive due to my condition. The council won't put my needs banding until I'm officially homeless, so I'm not getting a council house anytime soon.\n\n I'm not hopeful for the future, Reddit.\n\nEdit: paragraph breaks",

They will be able to advise you more accurately.\n\nDepending when your landlord needs you to move out - it may take time for the house to sell and you could stay until contracts start to be exchanged.\n\nIt may be needed to move into short term accomodation, once that happens.\n\nBut since you arent being made homeless by your own actions your local council has a duty of care.\n\nApply for social housing your disabilities and the fact you are being made homeless will give you more points.",

We're trying to negotiate extra time with my landlord but it definitely has a time limit. Every little helps, though. \n\nWhat I wish the council would do is bump me up from a band B to a band A, but they don't do that until you're definitely homeless. I've been applying for council houses since 2021, as it would be a more secure situation, but I've had no luck. Due to my disabilities, I'm eligible for a bungalow, but they're as rare as two-headed sheep, understandably. Thank you again for your response, I welcome any and all advice.",

    "postText": "You, yes you, are my hero.  I don\u2019t know you, but you have helped to keep my family safe.  I am physician resident this year, aka my intern year. Much of the news focuses on those not wearing masks, not social distancing, and the political leaders and individuals behind the spread of this disease.  **So I need to get this off my chest, not enough is said about the countless number of people who have sacrificed towards trying to slow the spread.**  \n\n\nI appreciate every sacrifice, every missed opportunity, every missed dream, every canceled vacation, every lonely holiday and birthday, every missed school event, every moment of insanity from social isolation, and every moment of self-restraint you have shown.  Social isolation via solitary confinement is considered one of the cruelest forms of punishment you can put on someone.  Although not entirely the same, many of you have chosen to face isolation to protect healthcare workers, family members, the elderly, and strangers you have never met.  Many of you go to work (or work from home), and then turn down social opportunities for this cause.  Only you know the depth and extent of your sacrifice, and to you I tip my hat.  It makes the fear of going to work every day and knowing that I could accidentally bring something home that could kill my family much more bearable.  Thank you for wearing masks, following guidelines and being a great example to others.  \n\n\nI know you are discouraged at the recent surges despite your best efforts.  I know you feel cheated as you see others not willing to make the same sacrifice.  You are the \u201chelpers\u201d that Mr. Rogers spoke of to look for during times of tragedy.  The times \u201cperson of the year\u201d may be directed towards essential workers, but I want you to know that I consider you part of these essential workers.  You are the type of people that would sacrifice their life for a higher cause. You are the ones that have helped the pandemic become less worse than it would have been.  Thank you.  Please reach out and stay connected with others.  Please get help for your mental health if it has taken a toll on you to make such a sacrifice.   \n\n\n**TL/DR:  I'm tired of all the focus on those not helping the cause. \nThose who have been quarantining since March are my personal heroes and you may never know how much it has meant to me and my family.**\n\nEdit:  Thanks for the awards but you are the heroes that deserve them :)  Also, I do understand people have to work and should work.  I am grateful for people who go to work as well (100%) and who are also trying to minimize exposure outside of work.  \n\nI also agree that mental health is very important. Please find ways to get out and into nature, find ways to connect with people socially, and seek help for your mental health (via tele- services etc.).",

I haven't seen my friends or family since February, it's just better not to put them at risk considering I am exposed to this thing every day. \n\nNobody tends to think about pathology staff, we're the invisible behind the scenes folks you always take for granted. We never get thanks, only angry phone calls when a test is taking too long because the machine is broken or whatever. It can be very demoralising. \n\nBut, we're still there. I was expecting staff to drop and start quitting with stress, but everyone's still there. And when this thing is finally over? We're all going on the biggest fuck-off all nighter bar crawl you have ever seen. Motherfuckers gonna *know* the Micro crew is in town that night.",

Part of me being a mom is planning outings, playdates and activities for my kids. Since covid I havent taken them anywhere aside from the store very rarely (they wear masks and are not allowed out of the cart or to go around touching things. There has been the odd playdate with others that have been careful. I mean, I couldn't even take them to the park when it was warm because the playgrounds were off limits and then they just spent the whole time questioning why they weren't allowed on the equipment. No physical school or preschool anymore, no trampoline/play places, no library, no rec center classes, swimming or local sport teams. It's been hard on everyone just inside all the time.",

You can't  really call yourself attractive without sounding like an ass. You probably shouldn't call yourself un-attractive, because that sort of judgment impacts your self-image over time. Instead, if someone calls you attractive, it means they find you attractive! The same should apply to heroism.\n\nToday, OP thinks you're a hero - and so do a lot of other people. Doing the right thing isn't always easy, even if the right thing aligns with your self interest. Most people will never know the motivations for your actions, but everyone will experience their outcome.\n\nThanks for doing the right thing, and for treating yourself well too. \ud83d\udc4d",

I\u2019m being made to feel as if IM CRAZY, when I want to protect myself, my family and others. I want to end this so I can have my life back to normal.

So many more people are now ordering things that they normally wouldn't and I can't fault or blame them. Please don't take this in a negative light, it is what it is and I fully respect and support whatever people need to do to be comfortable and safe - don't go to the store if you don't feel comfortable with it, order online if you can.

Everyone is making traveling plans to spend time with their loved ones for the holidays, and I'm like... Did I go crazy?

One re-infection grows geometrically so at the beginning I recognised that if you infect just one extra person, the consequence is that within a year, hundreds more will be infected, several people could and probably will die because of you.\n\nFrom of the amount of Zombie and horror films I've seen throughout my life, the consistency is that the dumbest people die first because they're ignorant and make blatantly stupid decisions like not following basic safety protocols. The dumb people are the ones you shout at your screen to, to tell them \"DON'T GO IN THERE YOU FUCKING IDIOT\". Horror films are masters of schadenfreude really.

That large of call volume and that many floor employees and we've had 18 confirmed cases, all who have fully recovered. 18!\nThe majority of this thread acting like stepping out of their dwelling will result in certain death is alarming. From the mental health aspect, solitary confinement will kill you just the same, some of these folks are going to have some major problems for years.

During remote working, I tried to kill myself (I\u2019m ok now). I just couldn\u2019t take it. I have since made a small circle of friends who also live alone. There are five of us, and we go do outdoor activities together regularly, like hiking, going to the park, having dinner on a patio. Tbh I would probably judge us if I were to see our little group. But we don\u2019t know each other\u2019s circumstances and shouldn\u2019t judge at first sight. \n\nThat being said...\n\n&gt;those who aren\u2019t following the rules are not helping the situation but that\u2019s their lives\n\n\nThe problem is it\u2019s NOT just their lives. So many people are being completely irresponsible (and you can\u2019t always tell who is who). Now my county (Tarrant County, TX) of 2.7 million people is down to 18 ICU beds. Not 18,000.  E I G H T E E N. Denton county to the north (just over 1 million people) is down to 6 ICU beds. People\u2019s actions do not just affect themselves. And therein lies the problem. This is not sustainable. We need to find a way to STOP the needless spreading from things like crowded bars and indoor dining. EVERYONE needs to do their part to limit the spread. But the best way to regulate that is problematic. I don\u2019t know the right answer.",

COVID has taken its toll on several of the sites and it's her job to go in and manage the response when there's an outbreak.  She's told us quite a few heartbreaking stories.\n\nWe only go out for essential errands.\n\nMy wife and I have not gone out to dinner since last February.  We do takeout from our local restaurants but that's it.  We didn't go anywhere to eat outside.\n\nWe would vacation and travel to see friends and that all stopped last year.\n\nI saw my mother last month for the first time since last Christmas when I did yard work and stayed outside.  I've only seen 2 of my 3 (adult kids) once each this past year and both times were outside.\n\nThe only family gatherings that we have attended was a funeral last June (all outdoors and distanced) and Zoom calls.  We have not celebrated birthdays, holidays, etc. since last year.   \n\nWe do this not because we are giving up our liberties or are sheep but because it is the right thing to do.  Many people who act like nothing has changed often say that their freedoms are being taken away from them because of masks, social distancing and modified behaviors.  What they fail to acknowledge is that with freedom comes responsibility.  We all need to work together and make sacrifices for the well being of everyone.\n\nEdit: my other SIL and her boyfriend mocked everyone who wears masks and is cautious.

My dad was laid off from his job in airplane manufacturing. My 30th birthday was this August: I spent it at home watching Legion, didn't even bother getting a cake. I won't see my family for the holidays. I've lost a lot of strength from not working out since the spring. I've lost a lot of general motivation &amp; joy. And I feel like I'm constantly having to \"convince\" people back home that masks work and that the virus is serious. My parents already know several people who have died, yet they can't seem to persuade the rest of my family to care enough to quarantine properly. I'm not even sure how optimistic to be about 2021: I'm terrified that not enough people will take the vaccine to make a difference. I feel like my mental health would be in a better place if I were able to have faith in the actions of the American public, but I just feel let down by my communities over and over. All of this has been really hard. Thank you for recognizing this, and thank you for your perseverance too.

Rest assured that everyone who tries to do their part by isolating and being responsible appreciates your hard work, sacrifices and commitment. Unfortunately, it feels like a unilateral slap to the face when global political leadership (this is not about America, I'm European and ATM speaking about our own politics) will not try to protect either party and just assigns blame. I wish you and your family well, and to find it in your hearts to push through this thing.",

It also gives them more time to get our new building fully functional. I have gone out a few times when things were starting to open up before it got bad again, but now I don't go out at all anymore. I even started getting groceries delivered. \n\nThis is for sure going to be a hard habit to break. I am without a doubt in hermit mode and honestly I kind of love it. Fresh air is nice, but I do not need to go anywhere. My car also has a piece that I need to fix before I can drive it anywhere anyways. My house is my sanctuary right now. It would be nice if my bf and his son could cool it with the farting though.",

    "postText": "I've been with my bf for about a year now. When I met him he told me that he was in therapy, was working through things, and was trying to be a better person. That was the extent of it though I tried to ask for a few questions.\n\nHe is a person who from his perspective grew up in a upper class neighborhood but a very violent home life. His mom would constantly be physically abused on a daily basis and mentally reprimanded by his dad. Accordingly to him, she would constantly blame herself and promise to be better.He thought these types of relationships are normal especially since his parents were together so every relationship he got into, he copied his father. So he abused every girlfriend he had from the ages of 16-28, whether emotionally, mentally, or physically. During that time period, no one ever reported him or pressed charges. I know because I checked. \n\n2 years ago, his mom found the courage to leave and basically spoke to him after a few months and talked to him about the amount of abuse she had endured from his father for decades. That conversation basically woke something up in him and he went and got help. \n\nHe told me all of this earlier this week.. He\n said I'm the first healthy relationship he has had, that he regrets what he has done and that for the last 2 years, he has tried to make amends even though he understands there's no apology that can make up for what he did for his exes.\n\nTbh, I'm scared of him now mostly because it  was only his mom leaving her abusive relationship that made him realize that what he was doing to his exes was wrong. He thought abuse was ok so what's stopping him from falling into his old ways? I no longer feel safe around him, whether as a romantic partner or  friend and I don't know if I should just end it.",

            "comment": "I think it's important to have him clarify  how he is able to manage this healthy relationship with you. If he talks about personal changes such as going to therapy, learning to recognize abuse behaviors etc, it's a good sign that he is addressing the abusive behavior at the source. If he attributes the change to you (\"you bring out the best in me,\" \"you are so different,\" etc), then consider that a red flag. He's setting up to make you responsible for his actions and behaviors and you are never responsible for fixing bad men.",

I got help and doing a lot better as I have learnt healthy ways to cope with anger (which doesn\u2019t include punching and kicking walls). My wake up call was after full on kicking a wall or almost quitting my job\u2026. Anger for me was a defence mechanism to stop myself from getting hurt.\n\nSadly some people aren\u2019t bought up with healthy ways of dealing with situations and it sounds like your bf was a victim as well in one sense. It is sad it took him a long time to get his wake up call about his behaviour being unhealthy and dangerous, making further victims of abuse.\n\nThe question you could potentially ask are does your bf see his ex\u2019s as victims of his abuse? Does he hold any of them to blame for his abuse? What were his motivations to make amends? What are the warning signs that predetermined how he would act with an ex? \n\nYou have a right to walk away for whatever reason. Your bf was working on himself originally for him and I hope he continues with his therapy.",

Why even write this? Is his feelings the only thing that matters? What about HER feelings and sense of safety? What about the well-being of his victims throughout the year? Boohoo he felt bad and has \u2018changed\u2019 now. Boohoo it was soooo hard for him to disclose the fact that he's an abuser and a women beater so he should be forgiven because he choose to disclose this info? How can we know this change is permanent and that he won\u2019t revert back to abusing women? We don\u2019t know that and statistically speaking, breaking an abusive pattern is hard.\n\nOP if you are reading this, don\u2019t listen to any of these abuser apologists, if you don\u2019t feel safe, you don\u2019t feel safe. Do what is best FOR YOU. These internet people going \u2018poor him\u2019 is not going to stand up for you if something happens to you. They\u2019d not going to be there to help you. If you were to post something like this after you were abused, these same people will turn around and ask why did you stay when you knew he did this shit to multiple other women. You have to protect yourself. There are so many good men out there that never think that abusing their partner is ever okay and they would never lay a hand on another person.",

He didn\u2019t know what a healthy relationship was at all. Our relationship was horrid. We split after 4 years. He\u2019s now married, has been with this woman for 7 years now. He\u2019s acknowledged what was wrong, he took the steps to be a better father and partner etc. Therapy. Everything. Cut ties with his mother. His waking moment was when our daughter (2.5/3 at the time) asked him why he made mommy bleed and cry all the time. She\u2019s now 10. Me leaving and her saying that snapped something in him. \n\nI\u2019m incredibly proud of who he is today. I adore his wife. He\u2019s an AMAZING father to our daughter and her step brother. He worked incredibly hard to break the cycle of trauma. \n\nIf people want to change, they can and they will.",

You think you're helping, but you're just showing the end result of whatever you're dealing with being neglected and used for ammunition on random people whom you know nothing about.  That's on you.  I was physically, verbally and emotionally abused by a woman during my childhood until I was an adult, yet, I don't believe that it's impossible to change.  It wasn't easy. It was painful for my abuser to realize what she had done.  It almost killed her, yet somehow, she was able to become the person that I know and love today.  I had to go through my own hell too, but I did the work, and I still do the work.  We both do.  I had to forgive earnestly and I had to look at my own behaviors that I learned from her that no longer suited me and who I wanted to be.  OP, it's not so black and white, and healing, remorse and amends are not only possible, but probable from someone who is reflecting on their past self.  That kind of introspection does not come easy, and coming to terms with who you are and what you've done/ who you have been, is a painful process full of self hatred, regret and shame.  You aren't obligated to stay through that process even if you believe what he's saying, but you also don't have to believe that he is incapable of the change he says he is experiencing.  Only you know the answer.  You do what's best for you, whatever that may be.",

It\u2019s not unheard of, but it\u2019s rare.\n\nAll too often, the abuse causes permanent, literal *damage* to the brain, and permanently alters the way the person sees the world. Witnessing that kind of abuse can have just as severe an impact as being the target. It\u2019s honestly inspiring that your boyfriend has enough sense of compassion to put in work (and it\u2019s hard work) to try to break the cycle of abuse. \n\nAll that said, if you don\u2019t feel safe, you don\u2019t feel safe. You can\u2019t have a healthy relationship with someone who scares you. But, ask yourself, is it something that he has done in your current relationship that causes you anxiety? Or is it *solely* his history? Either way, your feelings are perfectly valid, but if it\u2019s just his history that frightens you, maybe take some time to think on it before you break things off.",

My honest initial reaction was anger and disgust, however I quickly felt guilt for those feelings as I was told how that patient was abused by adults. Really puts things into perspective and cannot judge someone. That poor person\u2026only doing what they knew because it was done to them thinking it was normal\u2026.ugh. Humanity disgusts me but people like my friend and yourself working to help those get through the trauma rebuilds my faith. Best of luck to you and your patients internet stranger.",

Yes, there are real consequences for how you treat people. He is nearly 30 and has been abusive up until a couple years ago. That's basically his entire life. And you're balking because the only person he didn't abuse isn't cool with him having abused other people before she met him?\n\nBeing alone is a natural consequence of abusive behavior. Abusers deserve much worse, but they at least deserve to be alone. \n\nThat doesn't mean that there's no hope for him at all. It's wonderful that he saw the error of his ways and sought to change and better himself. But part of growth is owning up to your past and accepting the consequences of your behavior. If she feels uneasy being with him after learning this about him, that's understandable. Would you want to continue living with a roommate who confessed that they'd murdered someone? Even if they've never displayed violent tendencies, you'd still always be thinking about it, in the back of your mind.",

Yes, the cycle of abuse is a thing, but he abused women for TWELVE YEARS, and during ten of those he was an adult. His girlfriends likely confronted him about his abuse but he didn\u2019t change his outlook until his mother told him it was wrong. Personally, I would never be able to date someone like that. You are justified in being turned off that he didn\u2019t realize abusing women was wrong until his mother told him when he was nearing 30. In this modern day and age he had plenty of resources to learn about healthy relationships. If he attended college, he was likely required to take courses on sexual and domestic abuse. Idk I just personally wouldn\u2019t be able to accept his childhood as justification for his actions.",

You have the right to walk away from him, few of those who used violence are reformed, so be on the lookout and never forget what he is capable of.

If he only realised that abuse is wrong two years ago, due to his mother leaving, and you have been together for aaround a year, then the **maximum** amount of time that he could have been working on himself - *alone* - in order to ensure he can be in a relationship is one year. And that is assuming that he did not date anyone in that time and went to therapy almost the day after he spoke to his mother (realistically, it's probably less than a year, given that he only spoke to his mother about this a few months after the breakup two years ago). This doesn't seem like a very long time to unpack his entire childhood and work through 12 years of abusing his female partners - even if he were going weekly.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEDIT to add: wishing love and happiness and joy to this man's mother.

He did not tell you anything other than he was working on himself until a year into your relationship. Sounds like he\u2019s letting you know he\u2019s trying, but also setting the table for a slip up. \n\nWhen you physically assault someone you cannot use the excuse that i thought it was \u201cnormal\u201d. Many people have seen abuse worse than others can imagine and still have the self control to not repeat the pattern. \n\nHe needs longer to work his therapy and determine if this is actually a change in his behaviors or is he just trying to get you to view him in a positive light.

Therapy is about the individual receiving the counseling, whereas counseling that addresses abusive behaviors like battering are not exclusively from the perspective of the abuser.

            "comment": "Whenever you're dealing with change, a key component is whether the individual feels the need for change in their heart. Sometimes folks intellectually understand that they need to change, but in their heart they don't want to.\n\nIt's easier for some to understand this when discussing addiction. You'll see people repeatedly go to rehab because they know they need to get clean, but in their heart they're getting clean so that they can enjoy their next time using, chasing the feeling of their first high. It's once the feeling for change emanates from their heart is when real and permanent change takes place.\n\nIn the case with your boyfriend, I would suspect that he wasn't happy with how his personal relationships have gone and that he wanted to change that. With his mom speaking to him it likely put words to the feeling that he had this heart. I would lean towards believing that he has it in his heart to change.\n\nIf you choose to stay in this relationship, which I'm not saying that you should or should not do, you will have to be an integral part of his change. There will be some ups and downs as he adapts to new ways of dealing with interpersonal relationships, but those ups and downs will smooth out over time. Not saying that he will be perfect, because nobody is.\n\nSit down and have the long talks with him about where he has been and where he is going and how he is getting there. Learn what he needs from you for support. Let him know what you need from him. Once you're on the same page with what he needs for his recovery from abuse, then you know how to help things move in that direction.\n\nSo the question for you to ask yourself is how do you feel your relationship has been going? Has he acted in ways that you thought were physically or mentally abusive? If you've seen some glimpses of that, do you think the situation has improved? Do you think this relationship is important enough that you're willing to put the work in? Realize that any relationship that you're in is going to involve work can especially to get through the low times.\n\nBest of luck to you. I hope that whatever choice you make regarding your partner that you have future success with your relationship(s).",

The fact he recognizes the problem, knows he was wrong, and is actively seeking help is a good sign. Most abusers will NEVER do that. I think it's important to analyze the relationship you've had until now. Has he ever showed any signs of aggression before? Any red flags whatsoever? I'd also talk to him and have an honest discussion about it. Also him why he's in control. Is it a good reason like the therapy and healthy changes, or is it something weird like \"you bring out the best in me\"? Because if it's the latter that's definitely one hell of a red flag. I guess what this all boils down to is if you still have feelings for him, maybe do some investigation and see if it's worth it to continue with him, if you could feel safe doing so.\n\nAgain, I'm not a psychiatrist or anything like that, I'm just some dude who's dealt with abusers and done some reading on the topic. If in your heart you believe leaving him is the best option, ABSOLUTELY do it.",

May I ask if you've experienced anything remotely similar in your formative years?  If not, this is why you can not grasp his perspective.\n\nAbuse is a cycle, as is its trauma. I've seen it happen in my own family. Are there classes that teach what abuse is? Because I'm fairly certain people only wind up in those *after* they commit DV and are charged. Those classes also don't explain the psychology behind it.\n\nHe explained it well to you and is in therapy. He had no other model to show him what is right. He then immediately made the effort to change upon realizing his error and is ashamed. This is what truly expresses what his character is. I can't say anyone else in my family took this route, even after realizing its damage. They all don't want to be our father while  being ignorant to some of the same patterns they repeat, and suggesting such a thing would immediately set them off.\n\nIf you don't feel safe, you don't feel safe. However, I would look at the relationship for red flags rather than react at solely this.  It really, *really* isn't common for those to actively seek help on their own accord if they aren't serious about change.",

Which is great but it still never got rid of my worries or fear.\n\nWhat did however was the day we got drunk together and he broke down crying to me about how much he regrets what he did and how he knows if there is a hell he'll rot in the deepest part of it for what he did to me and my brother. This is what got rid of my fear and got me to trust him again and now we have the best relationship a father and son can have, we work together and joke together and generally spend a lot of time together with a  healthy relationship.\n\nSometimes that wake up call is all someone needs to break the cycle of abuse and maybe your boyfriend has done that, and maybe he hasn't but if you can have one of those moments with him like I did where you can see the honesty and remorse maybe the relationship is worth saving or maybe not that's down to you OP, but hopefully this has given you some insight and will help you make your decision. \n\nIf you do decide to stay with him and he shows any signs of being abusive towards you just please please please make sure you reach out to those you trust and get out of there asap. \n\nGood luck with your decision OP and I wish you the best!",

My wife and I were both in counselling (separate and together sessions) and worked through a lot (both still are). We both had learned abusive behaviours while growing up and used them to attack and defend. It\u2019s a tough process that I assume most couples/people go through because it\u2019s growth and they\u2019re called growing pains for a reasons. \n\nWe appreciate having each other through this because we\u2019ve always been \u201cleft alone\u201d, but we\u2019re married and had 3 toddlers. A 1 year relationship is a lot easier to get over than years of learned behaviours, even with constant self-awareness and self-correcting and therapy/counselling. But he has begun the process and is working to better himself, so I would encourage you to speak with him about what he\u2019s learned about himself (triggers, reactions). State simply you need to reassess the situation to understand how and when to potentially volatile topics/situations that could put you at risk. It doesn\u2019t need to be graphic, but if he still does not share, you get to decide if you trust him and what he\u2019s saying/doing, or yeet that relationship and move on, no regerts style, lol.",

I will say this though, my therapist said once that the ONLY times someone like your boyfriend changes, like actually changes, is when they seek out help themselves. Not when they\u2019re court ordered to anger management, or coerced into therapy by friends/family, they have to be the one to make the decision to change and it is only successful when the individual recognizes the issue and is determined to make a change without any external pressures telling them or forcing them to do so. Based on that info, I\u2019d say your bf is one of those people that has a chance to actually change for the better. But it is never your responsibility to stick around based on that small glimmer of hope. Do what feels right for you and not what you think you have to do. If he really is changed/changing, then he will still continue on that journey with or without you, you have absolutely no obligation to stay and you didn\u2019t sign up to be on that journey with him in the first place.",

    "postText": "I recently moved home due to financial issues and started working two jobs in order to get back on my feet. I have successfully paid down almost half of my debt in six months with them. One is a night shift job 9pm-730am Monday through Thursday and the other three days I work 12pm-12am. Both jobs have commutes of about 30/45mins but pay well and are in my field. I love working late nights and overnights but my family refuses to be quiet when I am home trying to sleep. Now I don\u2019t mean silent - I have ear plugs and a white noise machine for expected levels of noise - but my parents will shout at each other from across the house, will invite friends and family over (especially my very young, very loud nieces) and will rile their dogs up to bark in the middle of the day. They are both teachers and have the summer and weekends off so now I get no relief during the work week. When I have brought this up to them with varying levels of understanding, I get told that I *chose* to work nights and that I just have to deal with the consequences of normal day to day activities of regular people. \n\nLast night after only getting my typical five hours of interrupted sleep I got on the freeway to drive to work and fell asleep behind the wheel. A cop pulled me over for driving erratically and probably saved my life. When I finally got home after a short parking lot nap and calling out of work, my step mother openly mocked me for as long as I was out in the living area about being lazy and not wanting to work my scheduled shift like an adult. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m this close to turning back to stimulants just so I can survive my commute. I\u2019m so tired. I\u2019m so angry. I just want to survive long enough to get out of this house. I just want to cry.",

            "comment": "Dunno if this is a feasible suggestion or not, but have you thought about getting a room at a hotel every once in awhile that\u2019s close to where you work? Not saying every day/night of course but maybe once or twice a week when your schedule allows, you could get a much more peaceful and longer sleep on the occasion that you do rent a room. Main plus would be getting you away from all the noise of your home life for a night so you can get a night or two of refreshment and reset.",

And I know I\u2019m an adult and should suck it up as they don\u2019t have any control over my finances but it\u2019s just easier to not have to deal with a lecture when I can avoid it. Maybe I can try like once a month to start. Thanks for the suggestion",

I totaled my car when I hit a fire hydrant going 35-40 mph. Luckily no one worse was on the road and I was in the car alone. After that I really started taking my sleep very seriously and made changes to sleeping arrangements.",

Maybe consider the move out soon, it sounds like you won't last much longer if you just got pulled over for falling asleep. Screw your parents, you've crossed the boundary into putting others lives at stake! It's time to do something",

Unfortunately my debt is in part due to an eviction and without clearing at least that up entirely I won\u2019t be able to move out without a co-signer which I don\u2019t currently have. I\u2019m going to be looking into something temporary that is outside their house as soon as I can, honestly living in a car sounds really nice at this point. At least I would get to sleep.",

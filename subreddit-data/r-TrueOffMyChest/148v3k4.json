    "postText": "hi this is my first time posting here! so i, f19, am dating my boyfriend, m19, and things are going really well. we have been dating each other for about a year, but we have known each other since we were in pre k. anyways, today we played online games together until he fell asleep. i continued for a bit longer, but i would take occasional glances at him to make sure i didn\u2019t wake him up. i didn\u2019t know what made me realize or think this but i think i really want to be with him for the rest of my life. i have never felt love this pure for anyone before, and sometimes when i look at him in the eyes i want to cry from how much i love him. sorry for such a cheesy post but i have no one else to talk to about this so why not post it here :)",

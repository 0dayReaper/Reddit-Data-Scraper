    "postText": "I was trying to post in relationshipadvice but I guess I\u2019ll post here again because my account is \u201ctoo new\u201d.\n\nI (36m) posted about what happened on another sub. Terrible mistake to ask reddit for advice, but they did open my eyes to the absurdity of the situation.\n\ntldr, I got images from a guy, \u201cRob\u201d, who claimed to have had a long running affair and young child with my wife of 17 years. I had a bit of a breakdown, and talked to my uncle\u2019s husband who\u2019s a divorce attorney to get proceedings started.\n\nBefore filing, I decided to talk to my daughter (16F) who is a \u201ctechie\u201d because I started to suspect the pictures were fake after comments on Reddit talking about how unreasonable it all sounded and if I was \u201csure Rob was telling the truth\u201d. My daughter\u2019s done a lot of work with photo editing and graphic design. I didn\u2019t really want to get my kids involved, but I trust her. \n\nShe started calling me an idiot almost immediately and started talking about deep fakes. She echoed a lot of concerns other people mentioned. My wife calls us multiple times a day when she\u2019s away+ when would she find the time to have a second family!\n\nAnyway, I threw the papers away, and decided it was some kind of elaborate prank, but my wife found the papers while going through recycling and started screaming at me.\n\nI showed her the images I received and the texts, but she is offended I didn\u2019t trust her. She is saying I should have come to her first, and to immediately resort to divorce without proof is ridiculous. But come on!!! I saw pictures of you with another man and \u201cyour\u201d kid!!! That was my \u201cproof\u201d!!\n\nAnyway, she\u2019s staying with a friend right now and is declining all my calls. She said I should fish the papers out of the recycling, because they might still have a use to them.\n\nIs there any way I can make my wife see my side? I was genuinely so blindsided and heartbroken.",

And he was none the wiser?\n\nCome on. Literally unbelievable. \n\nIf OP made the cheater a man, that would at least make a bit more sense. But I absolutely do not believe a man would think it was possible for his wife to carry a child for 9 months without him knowing. No grown sentient human being would believe that.\n\nHe says she travels for work for 1-6 weeks at a time. Not 9 fucking months.\n\nAlso by his math, they married when he was 19 and she was 25 (and ostensibly had been dating a while before that). Which is possible but not probable. If that's true, he should go ahead with the divorce because he was likely groomed.\n\nWhat would be the motivation for \"Rob\" to do this?",

You fucked up Mega huge and you grasping on having \u201cmy side\u201d will stop you from ever fixing this. There is clearly some distrust you have that you need therapy to deal with on your own.",

The advice is to collect more evidence and get a lawyer.",

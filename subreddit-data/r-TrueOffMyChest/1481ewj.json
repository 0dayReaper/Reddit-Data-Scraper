    "postText": "To begin I don\u2019t think it will ruin the moment in any way but it\u2019s also not something I will easily be able to forgive her sister for.\n\nIn short I don\u2019t know how to feel.\n\nI brought her sister in the help me with her side of the family planning. We live together currently so pulling her parents aside for their blessing would be difficult without her sister distracting her. \n\nI found out minutes after I asked her to help me she blabbed to my girlfriend. It\u2019s something I\u2019m upset about because I know how much my girlfriend loves surprises and I feel like her sister took this moment away from us. This is months of planning and beating around the bush and secret keeping ruined by letting one too many people in on the surprise. I\u2019m looking for advice on how to feel and any stories on if this has happened to anyone else.\n\nTLDR; I\u2019m planning to propose and my girlfriends sister told her after I brought her in to help and I don\u2019t know how to feel.",

Wait a day, or even a couple hours, or move to a slightly different location.Your gf will be super pissed at her sister for that period of time and when you do pop the question she will be thrilled.\n\nBut she will also reprimand her sister for being such a blabbedmouth and almost \u201cruining\u201d the engagement. Forgive the sister she\u2019s just a dummie. And you learned a valuable lesson.\n\nMazeltov homie",

That was a shitty stunt to pull, and you have every right to be angry.\n\nPersonally, I would tell your gf that you are aware that her sister betrayed your confidence, you have therefore canceled your plan to propose, and it's going to happen in some other way and at some other time -- and this time no one is going to be let into the plan.\n\nI would also never for one red hot second ever forget that your future SIL cannot be trusted, and I would govern my behavior accordingly.",

            "comment": "I\u2019m really sorry that surprise was ruined and  I\u2019m sure your girlfriend is probably disappointed as well cause I mean who wouldn\u2019t want that to be a surprise. I definitely the sister did it to be spiteful and jealous. Idk if she genuinely likes seeing her sister Happy if she ruined a surprise like that. Try to plan something else that\u2019s just you to but don\u2019t tell anyone. I know it\u2019s hard but it\u2019s honestly the only option. Maybe have two back up plans one where you tell your gf parents and if they tell your gf sister and she tells your gf again then resort to the other back up plan where her parents don\u2019t know. And if they get upset explain to them how you had to keep if from them since they couldn\u2019t honor your wishes. Make sure to have someone take pictures of the private proposal (hire a photographer that you don\u2019t know so you are able to make sure the proposal won\u2019t be ruined) Hope everything works out for the best! And congrats on your soon to be engagement! :) \n\nEdit: speak to your girlfriend about how your feeling cause your gf needs to set boundaries! Regardless if she was excited or not it was rude for her to ruin the surprise within minutes after you asked her for help. It\u2019s not right for her sister to be ruining things like this for you or your gf. Cause what if you try to plan a surprise birthday party one day and she takes away the surprise reaction you were looking forward to?",

    "postText": "Am I taking it over the top?^^^ was meant to be in the title but i forgot, sorry!\nWarning! Talking about self harm\n\n\n\nI had a casual life when i was a child, I was a bit of an odd one yet i still enjoyed most of the time. People would call me homophobic slurs from the age of 9, they were right but i didn\u2019t know this yet, it still goes on today, it hurt a lot but i tried to get on with it. I was always awkward at school and i was kicked out of several groups of friends which made a separate chat excluding me. I felt so alone and stuck in a trap with no escape. I am still called the slurs today. When i was 14, I had a PE lesson where I suddenly passed out, It was in front of the whole class and it was probably embarrassing, some called me a spastic after it, and some were scared. I was terrified of myself, I had to cut things from my outside life, alone. It only got worse from there. I fell over in school and stumbled across paths, I went home early and had a seizure \n\nfor *20* minutes\n\nI was told my face turned blue, if someone wasn\u2019t there i had a chance of passing with my losing breath, I was taken into hospital immediately for a week, stuck with children crying with terrible illnesses. I crumbled knowing how much seizures etc can do to you. I was diagnosed with epilepsy later in June, I was sick to my stomach, I felt defeated, as if my whole life was suddenly stuck and would not be like anyone else\u2019s, with going to parties, getting hammered in the future and going out to places. We started medication in the July was small supplies of proscribed medicine. I now take them daily and I will for the rest of my existence. \n\nI feel like giving up, with the homophobic jokes thrashed into my face, being betrayed for doing something wrong, knowing that i could have seizures at anytime. There was a time in late July I had 6 seizures within 24hours, I was partially awake for this as one side of my body was completely numb from my mind, fitting whereas my other half of my body was knowledgable and my mind was swirling in pain. I told people in my school, for people to feel bad? To make people stop being rude? To show how bad conditions can be? The questioned are unanswered and irrelevant today, yet i still wish for an answer. Luckily, I haven\u2019t had a seizure for 6 months but taking the medication, limiting myself to going out with the lack of friends i have, limiting myself to life knowing there is consequences, I want to go out there, I wanted to possibly come out to my friends, I have a crush on this guy but he\u2019s probably not homosexual considering he\u2019s in the \u201cDa Boyz\u201d group. I know i\u2019ll have to keep quiet in my life, understanding why i need to be limited. But yet life would\u2019ve been simpler without my epilepsy \n\n\nof course\u2026\n\nBut life is life, and mine feels ruined and destroyed, I tried to commit self harm by cutting myself with some scissors. nothing bled out yet i had some marks on my arm, I still consider doing it as i build up too much, I want to escape and be myself but when I was told i had dead brain cells, I cried myself to sleep, I still do. I want to go get out, but where do I do? The future is unknown yet i feel like mine will be lacklustre. \n\nAm I being pathetic? Or is it okay to feel so bad and sorry for myself? Sorry if this isn\u2019t really the case off this but i wanted to send a message with how Epilepsy and people can to one\u2019s life, I feel sick to myself everyday, knowing how my body work\u2019s inconsistently, wishing i could ask that person out, but the risks are too high",

    "postText": "Without going into too much detail (we have been friends for 30 years, 52M &amp; 51M and both of us are heterosexual), he has been infatuated with a woman (40) he met at his job a little over a month ago.  They spent the first three days that they knew each other together.  They literally did everything together but have any type of sex.  Then she cooled off and he became obsessive about talking to me about how he couldn't figure out what went wrong.  I kept telling him \"I don't know, you have to talk to her about it\".  \n\nI'm an introvert and he's not.  And we both have known that since we met.\n\nIt's gotten to the point that I had to tell him last night that I'm not a therapist and that he really needs to think about talking to one.   I know he won't because he's the laziest procrastinator ever.  Trust me, 30 years of examples that I can give but I'm not going to, because it's exhausting.  \n\nWe have been through a lot of stuff together and we've been fairly close, good friends for the most part but he's been wearing me down for the last year.  I had moved away in 2019 and then a year ago we decided to live together with a third roommate (who no longer lives with us.  Alcoholic) to save money.  About 2 months ago, the alcoholic was forced out and it was better at first because we didn't have that drama anymore.  But it's been replaced with his drama.  \n\nHe has lots friends but he bombards me with all his stuff because \"he has no one to talk to\".  Last night I ended up telling him \"fuck off\" after he wouldn't stop talking about his problems.  I asked him, \"did I talk about my problems to you, all night, every night for the past month?\".  I don't but when I told him I was depressed a month ago, a few days later he said \"you're not depressed\"\n\nHe has argumentative personality in that almost anything is questioned.  And when he brings up his relationships with women, it's a repeating story.  So in the height of our conversation, after him telling me details I have heard again and again, I told him that the one common thing that he can't deny is that he is one half of all those relationships.  And that he needs to stop dumping on me because I am not a therapist and I'm sick of hearing about it.  My mantra to him for the last month has been \"Talking to me has no effect on your relationships if you won't say those things to them.\"\n\nSorry for rambling, just wanted to vent but not to my friends/family",

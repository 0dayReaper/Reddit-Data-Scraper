    "postText": "\nIt's a messed up situation. This took place 2 weeks ago. my son was attending a friend's birthday party and came home drunk and only admitted to my wife that he forced himself on a girl at the party. My wufe told me the next day and I didn't know how to feel about it  but she kept defending him and we had a huge fight about it. she kept covering for him,  basically just giving excuses like him being drunk and then expressing guilt and regret. I've been later told that the girl he forced himself on is the same girl he's been trying to get with multiple times but got rejected. I didn't react well, a couple of his friends who were and also tried to cover for him got officially banned from my home. My wife has been fighting with me about it as well and kept calling me names just for refusing to support her supporting him.\n\nThe house has been like hell eversince. I don't talk to her or my son and there's so much stonewalling when I try to speak to them and I'm sick of it. I don't know how things will play out going forward or how my son is going to fix this but I'm just so mad I can't even sit at the same table with him and also my wife for that matter.",

I found out this was due to him forcing himself on his gf\u2019s roommate after a night of drinking, he took advantage of her while she slept and he blames the alcohol. I\u2019ve had some guy friends defend him and blame the alcohol but I\u2019m not agreeing with this whatsoever. It\u2019s created a division between some of us, people choosing loyalty to him over being fucking civilized and not doing rapey shit. I simply tell people he needs to own up to what he did and get help for this and/or his drinking problem\u2026 I\u2019ve never had to deal with this so I don\u2019t even know where to begin and how to approach this, I can only imagine how much more difficult it must be when it involves your son and wife, not to mention how you gotta face that pressure on a daily basis under the same roof. Keep fighting the good fight, however that may be.",

I myself thought rape was my own fault because I only *said* stop, while if I would have screamed loud enough for others to hear, he would've stopped. It was actually a relief to hear that it met the criteria for rape, because I felt constant terror but my abuser said this was prove that I was the problem.",

When I was a minor I slept with a 30 year old woman, it had serious negative effects on my life I am only now beginning to fully understand. At the time I thought it was so cool but now I realize how big of a mistake it was and how fucked it was that she did that.\n\nNow that I\u2019ve started to talk about it a little bit it\u2019s annoying how people react. Even my own SO when I told her about it said \u201cyou were 16/17 it\u2019s not like you were a kid\u201d and I was like wtf SO, what would you say if the genders were reversed and a 30 year old married man fucked a 16 year old girl?? She apologized and said I was right but in general that is the kind of reaction I get. My therapist is the only person who has ever really reacted the way I have seen people react to similar situations regarding a young girl. \n\nIt\u2019s frustrating. I also had a bad experience with my college girlfriend, who cheated on my for 2 years, the whole time keeping it a secret, she told me she was raped when she was 16 when we first started dating, leading to me absolutely hating this guy who was still around, later when I found out ab her cheating she admitted that she had lied about being raped bc he told everyone they had sec and she was afraid it would ruin her reputation. Said it kind of got out of her control, that her mother asked her ab it bc she grew up in a small town and she got wind of it, her mother asked her directly \u201cdid he force himself on you?\u201d To which she responded yes, that she said no when it was happening and he continued. Her mother, of course, made a big deal out of it, which she wasn\u2019t expecting for some reason, and then she felt like she was in too deep so she never owned up to the lie. Thankfully he didn\u2019t go to prison bc there obviously no evidence but he did suffer serious consequences socially, there are still people in that town who think he is a rapist. So so fucked up.\n\nSo as I\u2019ve gotten older I get very frustrated by the double standard around only men being capable of sex crimes and that men are far more likely to act out sexually in immoral/illegal ways. I fully understand men do horrible things to women, and that it is more common, and that makes me angry, I hate it, but also as a victim myself I hate that men who are assaulted are treated so much different than women, not only are women predators far more likely to get a pass, but also men who are accused of sexual predation are basically presumed guilty even though false accusations do happen.\n\nI recognize this is all anecdotal and I don\u2019t expect sympathy, but it\u2019s my fucking life and it\u2019s frustrating IRL for me that my experience is minimized.",

Plenty of people have sex with closed legs lifted up, or doggy style with shut legs. The vagina's positioning is not good for denying sex, because your DNA doesn't care if you get raped or not. What it does is put the genitalia in a place that doesn't disrupt other bodily functions too much, and SOMETIMES, if it feels like it, make them in a position that allows easy protection.\n\nIf you really want to rape someone, you don't even need to be overwhelmingly stronger than them (by which I mean you don't need so much strength you could fold them in the literal sense). Their genitalia is easy to access on both sexes ; for women, the moment they get bent over they have no options. Men don't have an option other than laying flat on their bellies, which is a terrible position to take a fight from. Nevermind the fact that in all cases, something will be vulnerable ; anus or genitalia, unless you have a chastity belt. Anyone with genitalia and any amount of sexual experience will realize that unless every time they were around a naked person they were drunk to the point of damaging memory of the event.",

I was being sexually assaulted, molested, raped and badly beaten by a family member for years when I was a child. As I got older I realized how bad that trauma was. I did terribly in school, all my life. I was afraid of the opposite sex. I never asked anyone for help and when I did date or tried to pursue a man they were violent and manipulative. I ended up being gang raped again in my early twenties when I was asked to drive two guys home that were friends with the guy I was seeing at the time. I told my bf and he spoke with his friends I dropped off and they said I liked it and agreed to it. I just didn't scream out or call for help because there was more than one person, they could overpower me or kill me. I was also using my dad's car at the time and I was so scared I wouldn't be able to get the car back to him. That was almost 10 years ago and I dealt with severe depression and really closed myself off from the world. I had to quit my job and barely had the will to get out of bed everyday. I didn't tell anyone what happened because as a child no one tried to see what was wrong with me as a child and when I tried to ask for help or do something about the family member raping me, I would get in trouble and the family member would beat me so badly. The family member who was raping me moved in with my parents and I during the pandemic. I tried to steer clear whenever I could. He has kids and lives his life like he hasn't done anything wrong. He would bicker with my mother and undermine everything I was saying and I had to remove myself from the situation because Im never going to get justice. He gets to live his life everyday with people thinking he's a good man and I'm not allowed to say anything that could ruin his family. I now have kids and a family and I've never let him near my babies. I still deal with severe trauma and anxiety at 30. Stuff likes this kills people inside. OP's son's decision and behaviour will ruin lives.\n\nEDIT: Thank you to all of you who took the time to read what I had written. It was quite lengthy but it felt good to get off my chest. Thank you for the comments and the awards and concern and strength",

One is 42 and the other is almost 50. They are JUST opening up now because of the stigma that used to prevent men from talking about childhood sexual assault. Now they're starting to work with our local men's trauma centre (I'm in Canada). I'm so incredibly proud of them and I admire the f*ck out of their courage and decision to work on healing.\n\nI'm cheering for you brother \u270a",

I am watching the effects of the trauma hurt him in so many ways. In the last year, he started with some drugs. Now he is fighting an eating disorder and has major Body Dysmorphia Disorder. He is gnawing at the sides of his fingers due to untreated anxiety. \n\nHe is a true light to so many and beloved. He comes across as jovial and strong.  No one knows he is suffering like this but me, and my hands feel tied. \n\nThere are many nights I lie awake staring at the ceiling trying to come up with options. \n\nI won't stop trying to be there for him and you don't stop trying to be there for yourself. \n\nK, Boss? \n\nx",

And it is achievable for you. Maybe this will sound out of left field, but please don't start drinking. Feels good in the moment, but it's just like hitting snooze on your misery. \n\nStart to think of yourself like a pet or a little kid who you have to take good care of. It sounds so cheesy, but literally talk to yourself like a child and tell that kid you love them, you want what's best for them, you'll keep them safe.

I was 23 when I went for round 2 of therapy to learn to have healthy adult relationships (cuz a few things get wildly screwed up in our brains when adult sexual experiences happen as children). 23 was a tough year but it got better. I learned to date. I found safe amazing partners who helped me grow. Eventually I got married something 23 yo me would never have thought possible. You survived the worst part already. You are far stronger than you can ever realize. I wish you a life of happiness and fulfillment.",

Your son exhibits some classic signs of a Sexual Predator. The fact that this was someone who said \u2018No\u2019 to him and had rejected him before multiple times no less means he KNEW that she did NOT like him and did not want to because his multiple attempts were denied before when they were sober. Any normal person would move on and find someone who is interested in them instead of wasting their time repeatedly going back to this one person who keeps saying no. \n\nA predator will choose their prey, seek them out and attack at the moment their prey is most vulnerable and cannot escape\n\nWhen this girl was vulnerable enough for him and there was the opportunity he forced her anyway because he wanted to and to him that\u2019s the only thing that matters and then he used being drunk as an excuse to justify the behavior. \n\npredators seek to attack their prey when they are in their most vulnerable state and that is exactly what your son did. He feels entitled to whatever he wants and obviously does not take No for an answer. Whether he did this consciously or subconsciously is another thing but you need to deal with this head on because this behavior will not stop unless it is corrected. He will only escalate and become worse over time.  I don\u2019t know how you get your wife to be on same page and see how horrific this is but I hope she sees through the mom goggles soon.",

I'm so sorry this happened to you. \n\nI work in forensic psychology with serious crime cases and without intervention (so jail or forensic psychiatry with relapse prevention therapy) many sex offenders don't really change their behaviours. \n\nOP,  since your son is a young adult he could likely get into a forensic youth program/jail. It's a much more protected setting and has a wide range of therapeutical options for their inmates. Oftentimes, teen/young adult people also get a reduced sentence that enables them to resocialize soon enough after having learned relapse preventing skills. \n\nAnother thing to take into consideration is that your son confessed his crime to you and probably needs professional help to work through this in a healthy way (and not in a way that reinforces and validates his behaviour and reasoning behind the rape, like your wife unfortunately is doing by saying \"he was drunk / he's feeling bad about it\").\n\nedit: age of the son is 22, so not a teen",

It\u2019s been over a decade, I\u2019m married with children &amp; he still stalks me online. His mother still covers for him gfs, &amp; even tried to befriend my MIL online.",

I had cancer at the beginning of high school, and was diagnosed with depression disorder during that time - the woman used that known information to her advantage. \n\nA parent saw a boy grabbing a girl by the arms shaking her and pushed her against a car, yelled out through the parking lot to stop and let her go - he immediately calls his mom, while the parents calls the school. Before the school even has time to figure out who the teenagers are my exes mother has already called MY school counselor and told her  I was speaking negatively about myself &amp; having negative thoughts this morning, talking about \u201ccutting\u201d and self half. That while her son was trying to reason with me keep me from running to \u201ccut\u201d in the bathroom and give me a pep talk a parent driving by yelled something at us. Asked the counselor to please call me in today, and while she called my mom already to update her (haha no) please call her after speaking with me. I tell the counselor the truth\u2026 he was being rough with me because he saw me hug a male friend goodbye the day before &amp; I don\u2019t self harm/cut nor have I ever. The counselor took all of my words as lies in order to cover up my self harm, &amp; shame within myself- which is what she told my mom.",

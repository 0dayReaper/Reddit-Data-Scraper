That's crazy talk! \n\n\nMeanwhile...\n\n\nCorporate: We present our latest advertising blitz campaign - thank you commercials to our staff! It'll only cost about $50 million in ads, that's practically free!\n\n\nEDIT: Came back to see this exploded. Am not going to address each response one by one but just generally have some observations from the comments I've gotten... \n\n1. I'd readily admit I plucked the ad numbers from thin air since I am not a \"corporate guy\" who \"controls the marketing budget\". I used the recently reported ad numbers.. being from Bloomberg (over $500million!!!), divided that by a factor of 10 since we're not going to flood people like Bloomberg did, and considered the fact that ads might have gone up in price (given that we probably have the largest captive audience in history) and arrived at the completely arbitrary number of $50 million. \n\n2. Naturally, there are some people who think that there's nothing wrong with that as long as financially it makes sense and to these people I implore you to consider that we like in extraordinary times, where we have a chance to fundamentally rethink of how corporations should be run (less \"make money at all costs\" and more \"a win-win situation from employee to employer) and to consider the viability of ethically driven companies where everyone is paid a living wage to not just survive, but thrive.\n\n3. To the one person who argue that consumers should be held accountable for their own behaviour, I completely agree - we can all do better. Wear a mask, make a conscious attempt to touch less things while shopping, observe social distancing when possible. If we all do what we can, we will get through this.\n\n\nAnd to those of you who continue to work in the grocery stores to keep everyone fed, thank you.",

To avoid taxes a lot of wealthy people set up their fortunes within a tax loophole that stipulates their children cant touch the majority of the capital for 20 years and any profits from interest must be spent on charity.  Which sounds great on paper until you consider that this is why so many people who are rich from inheritance have their own charities named after them AND they have found ways to use this money for political purposes disguised as charity.  Ever tried to look deep into the financials of these charities? The ones that do actual charity work for the most part are getting around rules with loopholes saying as long as 51% is spent on charity then 49% can be put into political causes AND it doesnt have to be reported and donors dont have to be reported.",

None of us really expect to be tipped on some percentage scale because we get stiffed commonly on orders anywhere from $2.99 (coupons, discounts, complaining to a manager..) to $75 and up. (I delivered 30 pizzas to a hockey team post-victory and got stiffed on it last week.) \n\nWe just hope that if a customer is gonna make us drive a long distance (keeping us from other deliveries for a longer period of time), or make us juggle a buffet to your 5th floor apartment -- and then call you when we're outside the door, or they fall asleep and leave us desperately trying to reach you before we're forced to give up and go back with no income and a bunch of wasted time, they maybe throw us something better than $1 - $3.\n\nThis \"no contact\" stuff is essential but the way it works is bogus. It takes WAY more time in store as far as prepping the orders and sanitizing the bags, all of us constantly trying to wash our hands and wipe things down. When I get to their house I have to set up their food like I'm some merry fucking holiday pizza elf instead of just handing it to them. Many customers live in a time warp and have no IDEA what the hubub is all about or even get all freaked out because DIFFERENT! We're still taking cash orders, in spite of being \"no contact\" on all deliveries. So.. we're not 100% no contact and I don't forsee it actually being enforced soon. I have customers tell me at the door, after they've handed me cash, that I need to \"disinfect that as soon as I get to the store because we're all sick.\" \n\nWe're sacrifices and we're still making nothing. This is a ~~joke~~ boring dystopian nightmare.\n\nEdit: People who tip well, if you see this, thank you. You're not as common as you might think, and you're paying us directly and keeping us going. Thank you. Right now getting one solid tip breaking up a bunch of straight 0's is what directly changes the timeline of someones whole life.",

I've worked minimum wage in retail, and that was one of the hardest and most stressful jobs I ever had. I'm a software developer now, and honestly... it's really easy to do my day to day, and there's virtually no stress. I've had plenty of jobs in between and it's been this trend of more money = less work.\n\nI get where people are coming from when they think people don't deserve a living wage. They see the jobs virtually anybody can do and think it's not fair that those people would earn what they are earning, especially after developing special skills. Paramedics for instance earn around $15/hr. Criminal.  \n\nThese people are forgetting that raising minimum wage will lead to wage increases in their industry as well so that the industry stays competitive and attracts the best talent. So even from a selfish point of view, the grocery worker earning a living wage is good for you. It also boosts the economy, so the fast food worker earning a living wage is good for you. Then there's the fact that happy people work better, and put in more effort. This means better service all around. So the waitress earning a living wage is good for you.  \n\nThen of course there is the moral reasoning so many people just turn off. Minimum wage jobs aren't easy. They are extremely difficult and taxing, they just require little skill so anyone can do it. If you had the choice between your office administrator job and flipping burgers, both paying the same... you wouldn't be flipping burgers. If I as a software developer could earn the same money waiting tables in a restaurant... I'd still be a developer. So few people get this.",

People who are poorer are more likely to spend that money to meet daily needs in the short and medium-term, as well as any luxuries that may make life easier. \n\nThe impact of the money spent by them is magnified as that money changes hands from purchaser to store/service to employees to other stores/services. \n\nIt's called the multiplier effect. Giving people money so they can spend means that money can be used to pay the salary of someone else, who can then spend it. Some of this leaks out through taxes, which can be reinvested into the community to share the cost burden of communal infrastructure and services (healthcare, roads, etc).\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, walking through this reasoning is hard in a large number of cases when the other party sees salaries as a zero-sum game. In other words, a sense of \"if someone's pay is being raised due to government regulation but mine isn't, then they shouldn't get a pay raise. Someone's getting richer so I'm getting poorer!\"",

Nobody got a raise, everyone is expected to go to work and workplace has literally no rules for quarantine, they put hand sanitizers near coffe machines and that's it. they now started firing ppl off, already fired close to 20 in the last 2 weeks, not from his team tho. \n\nOur country started using police officers to check on public transport/cars and if people are keeping to the rules. I told him to gtfo from there half a year ago already and he's still thinking about it till now, he's only 22y old and has saved up some cash and still lives with mom(he pays rent,she buys food etc. so no problem on saving) and he could literally live for a year with his saved up money for rent/food., but still goes into that shit...",

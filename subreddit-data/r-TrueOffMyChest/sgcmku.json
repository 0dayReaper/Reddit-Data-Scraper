    "postText": "About a month ago, I found out both of my children where the results of my soon to be ex-wives affairs. I've had a feeling for awhile now that both them were not mine. 6 years ago when my son was born, I was the happiest I had been in my entire life. I had married my best friend, we had a child together, and everything seemed amazing.\n\nThat was until he started getting older. After a few years, I started to have doubts that he was actually mine. He did not look like my child. The more he started to grow, the more I realized just how different he looked compared to what I would expect a child of mine to look like. I am not petty or paranoid enough to let that alone drive me. It was my whore of a wife that really set my alarms off.\n\nWhenever she went out, she never went where she said she did. She would have huge holes in her schedule she could never explain to me, she would refuse to allow me to interact with anyone from her work place, and a close friend of hers accused her of flirting with her s/o at the time. It did not help that soon after our son was born, her lies started to catch up with her. Still though, I loved her like the fool I was. She told me up and down how much she loved me whenever one of her lies caught up with her. She had convinced me that despite the fact she was a lying and manipulative woman, that she wasn't a lying manipulative whore.\n\nLast year, she got pregnant again, and I still held out a small bit of hope that it was mine. But when her daughter was born, it was obvious she was mixed race. I refused to sign the birth certificate, and the paternity test I demanded afterwards proved my suspicions right all along. Neither of them are mine.\n\nThe day I got those test results were the day I filed for divorce from that whore and walked away from the family I had created. I knew that it would destroy her sons life to see me walk out. Despite my concerns, I was the best dad I could be to him.  I loved him with all my heart and put in 110% into being the father he deserved. Now though, when I see him I am filled with disgust. Disgust for my whore of a wife, disgust with myself for not trusting my instincts, and disgust that the last 6 years on my life have been for nothing. I have been told by multiple people now that I am a monster for leaving \"my son\" like this. My ex has tried on multiple occasions since I moved out to use him to guilt me into getting back with her. She will have him call me at random hours of the night crying and begging for \"his daddy\" to come back. The day I moved out, she paraded him into the room as I packed my things to show me \"how much damage I am doing.\" In every conversation that he is brought up, both online and off, I am berated and shamed. That despite the fact I am not the boys biological father, I am his dad.\n\nWhat I have sadly now realized is that, to most, my own feelings mean nothing. My parents are my only supporters through all this, with my own siblings calling me a despicable person for abandoning a child like that. My feelings of betrayal and sadness mean nothing, because a child is involved. I know it is not his fault. I know that the man he called his father for his entire life just walked away, But why am I expected to \"man up?\" Why should I have to pretend everything is fine and I do not feel contempt for this entire situation. Why should I put my own life and feelings aside? I never was the boys father, I loved him like one and honestly still do; but I would come to hate and contempt him if I had to play that role. Hate myself for not standing up and taking my own life back into my own hands. He is not my child, and even though it is not his fault, he is not my problem anymore.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit:\n\nWow, this post certainly blew up. Guess airing my dirty laundry accomplished something. Anyway, i've seen a few common questions so I'll just answer them here.\n\n1.) Her son knows the truth of why I left. I sat down and told him that I am not his father, and that his mother lied to me and cheated on me. i made it clear I am not mad at him, that it is not his fault this is happening, and no matter what I will still think he's an amazing kid.\n\n2.) Some are saying that I never loved him, or was always looking for a way out. It's hard to convey emotions in a text post like this, and even harder to allow vitriolic hatred towards your whore of a wife decontextualize the last 6 years of your life. You can believe what you want though.\n\n3.) I have a lawyer, and I'm not going to be paying child support or alimony.\n\nLast though, for those who say I should stay in her sons life and be his father. That's not realistically possible. I do not hate him, but I have been cheated on, lied too, and used by a vile self-centered whore who has now caught her children up in her lies and deceit. He is a casualty of her actions, and blameless. However, it can never change the fact of the harsh reality we find ourselves in. I don't hate him, I feel so sad when I think about how he feels. But, all I see when I look at him is 6 years of my life I was lied to. 6 years of my life I was used. And 6 long years of built up doubts and frustrations with a woman who used me. There is no putting aside my hatred to try and be in his life, because the life I lived with him was nothing more than a fa\u00e7ade cultivated by his mother. This is the harsh reality I find myself dealing with, and I simply cannot in good faith put myself or him through it any more.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 2:\n\nSince I am seeing many armchair lawyers in the comments saying this post is fake on grounds of what I said above. I will not reveal what state I live in, but I am currently going through a fun legal process called disestablishment of paternity. Won't shut up 90% of you who think google makes you a lawyer but at least I tried.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEdit 3:\n\nThis is going to be my last edit before I move on from this small little distraction I created for myself. First, I want to thank everyone for their kind words to me. In the comments, the DM's, and the chat. You have given me a bright day for the first time in a while. I wish I could reply to all of you, but I cannot thank you enough. \n\nSecondly, I have noticed many people criticizing the word I used very profusely to describe my soon to be ex. I want to just say, the place I am now is one of the darkest I have been in my life. I see nothing but white hot rage for the woman who ruined my life. Is what I said inappropriate? Is the word I used to describe her dehumanizing and vile? Yes. I will admit that. But I won't apologize for it. What I wrote here today was the truth of the world as it is for me right now. It is the raw unadulterated stream of consciousness of a flawed man. I do not intend to try and get people to hate women, or to push some misogynistic message about how women are terrible. That is not my goal here, and that is not the message of this post. I understand why people do not like the word I used here, and you know what I accept that as a valid criticism of what I did here today. \n\nI came here today to simply find some outlet for the situation I find myself in. To rant, mourn, and deal with the complex and raw emotions that have torn me apart for the last month. A place where I can freely speak my mind. And you know what, I did that. \n\nToday was pretty alright thanks to you guys.\n\nAgain to everyone who showed me love and support, thank you from the bottom of my flawed heart. To those who came here disagreeing with me but showed me respect, thank you as well. After the shame and ridicule I face in my real life, the respect you showed me despite your disagreement was nice.\n\nSo long, and thanks for all the fish.",

She later gave birth to a girl and he was certain that the girl wasn\u2019t his. Got a paternity test on both kids, found out both were not his. He tried to keep parenting the boy for awhile, but lost touch when his ex completely lost custody of both kids due to drug use and the kids went with grandparents. Such a crazy story with so much pain. I\u2019ve only heard this from my mom though, my dad has never volunteered this information up himself.",

The official reasoning is very telling:\n\n*Paternity tests were banned in France 15 years ago.

When you sign a birth certificate you are taking legal responsibility for that child, and are therefore financially responsible for them until the turn 18. AFAIK, the only way for that obligation to end would be for someone else to legally adopt the child. Even if OP gave up his parental rights, he would still be financially responsible until/unless someone else came in and adopted him. \n\nI agree with the other commenter - it is fucked up.

But it was absolutely a shit show, everybody was like \"you are lying about this\", \"she is 7 month pregnant and you an asshole\" etc. and her non committal position that it was his \"was female hormones\". The other part of the family watched it unfold in disgust and anger. I had the feeling the didn't care about his position at all, even some of the men.",

She can figure out who their bio-dad is and sue THEM for child-support, because a paternity test has already proven that **you have no biological children, and therefore, you don't owe child support to ANYONE.**\n\nSpeaking of bio-dad, why isn't anyone talking shit about THEM for NEVER HAVING BEEN AROUND OR PAID???? You're a hero who stepped up for two losers who won't even do what you did for their own children, let alone someone else's. You don't owe ANYONE any more of your time/money. If anyone talks shit about not paying/raising a kid THAT'S NOT YOURS, ask them why THEY don't pay/raise someone else's kid.",

When my dad finally admitted she was not coming back home ever, I felt so betrayed and abandoned and have never been able to think differently about it. I was a smart kid and if she had just sat down with me and explained what was happening and that she'd call me regularly and I'd visit her every two weeks, I would have been sad but not devastated.",

I have been told in very direct ways that, despite her son being the product of an affair, I am still responsible to him because I believed my wife was not a whore for 6 years. \n\nMy own sister told me that this child complicates things to such a degree that staying with my \"wife\" just to make sure the kid is unharmed was one of the best decisions I could make \"as a man.\"  \n\n\nPeople here on reddit have been much nicer (so far) to me at least. But I feel like in situations like this, the feelings of the child and the whore who cheated on her husband are taken far more into consideration than the man who was lied to, used, and cheated on.",

Any reprecusions are the fault of the scammer aka the mother. It is her duty to rectify the damage done not yours and it's easy for people like your sister to say you should continued to get scammed because they are not the ones experiencing it. Ask her is she would be willing to sacrifice the next 12 years of her life to support the child I doubt she would if she would she's welcome to pay a considerable amount of her monthly Income into a trust fund for the child.\n\nEdit: get yourself tested for STIs she clearly doesn't use condoms and likely don't care about the risk to you.",

And he loves you very much but he'll always be heartbroken that he can never. Be. Your. Real. Father.\"\n\nIn my dreams, right? But as a woman, I want to stress to you that this IS NOT your fault. I want to stress to you that your instinct is right, that it is better to leave, especially knowing you feel disgusted around him and don't see that changing. They can FEEL that shit whether you say it or not.\n\nI want you to treat yourself like a woman who is making the decision to abort a child that resulted from sexual assault. It IS NOT your fault. You and the child are victims of the horrible actions of another. If this child stays, you feel you will always see your assailant and not the child for what or who the child is. You are correct to keep those feelings away from the child. Trust. Your. Gut.\n\nYou owe nobody any explanation. You owe nobody any apology. You are the victim and it is the assailant's responsibility to fix the consequences of this shit, NOT YOU. Get a restraining order so she can no longer harass you with manipulative calls. Go to a support group for yourself and so you don't feel alone.\n\nI wish you a healing journey and hope this helps. I am so, so sorry for your loss.

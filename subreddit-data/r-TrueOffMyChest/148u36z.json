    "postText": "ik ima get people mad posting abt relationship at my age m(15) but i\u2019ve been dating this girl (f16)for a few months but the sparks weren\u2019t there anymore and i\u2019ve just returned from holiday and i saw my friends before her i knew i was going to end it with her but i didn\u2019t know when ( i ended it with her) so i went to my mates there was four of us not using real names been friends since primary jack(m15) jess(f15) molly(f15) so i as i got back they threw me a party and what not there was tequila that i brought back as you know the place i went is known for it we all got drunk and had to stay the night. i\u2019ve liked molly for ages since year 2 or grade 1 for Americans but on the night of the party we shared a bed the layout of where we were sleeping went jack, me, molly and jess so this meant me and molly were next to each other and jack is a starfish sleeper so he was spread out to me and molly were basically spooning with distance between us and she grabbed my hand and wrapped it around her waist and basically cuddled for the night but bc im not one to cheat but yk i\u2019ve liked her for so long i didn\u2019t do anything about it we just slept like that and the guilt of it all is really getting to me and i don\u2019t really care what you say about me because fair enough but i needed to get it off my chest.",

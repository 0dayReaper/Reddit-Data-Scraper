    "postText": "I'm Finnish. I surf reddit time to time. I go on r/pics and SURPRISE SURPRISE! Politics it is. Every day. USA politics are a massive obnoxious shitshow on both sides, it's easy to see it when you're out of the grid. Trump-tards going outside screaming USA because they can't go outside and anti-Trump people posting them. Trump opposers sculpting his head out of LITERAL HORSESHIT, etc, etc... Why the fuck do I have to see this on even non-political subs? \n\nI would also like to point out how big of a fucking echo chamber Reddit is. The guy I mentioned earlier got 50K upvotes for his literally shitty statue just because of the hivemind. We need a fucking change.\n\nEdit: It seems like [someone](http://imgur.com/gallery/mIRmlT4) sure got pissed :D Mods requested me to remove the name.\n\nEdit part 2: Editric Boogaloo: For sone idiots who stlii think I'm a Trump supporter: \n\n1: I hate Trump and he's a fucking idiot. Why the fuck would I suppot that tubby orange POS when I can see how a good government works in my home country?\n\n2: I hate the people circlejerking their Trump hate. They are the big reason why Reddit floods with politics, which I pointed out in the second paragraph. \n\nThe Trump-lovers fuel the Trump-haters who then throw their shit all over reddit. Both are guilty.",

Either the mods of popular subreddits would have to work hard to depoliticize them, or their subreddits would be hidden, so that more room would be made for fully non-political subreddits to become popular and replace them.

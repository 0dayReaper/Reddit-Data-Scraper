    "postText": "I have been battling severe health and general anxiety. Everyday I have something new to worry and obsess about.\n\nGP and Specialists are covered by my insurance so I give them a visit every now and then. I keep doing medicals tests and end up being restless and exhausted by night. And when I wake up in the morning it\u2019s the same thing again.\n\nUnable to bear this anymore. Last night I tried taking sleeping pills. Took 7 of them because that\u2019s all I had and 4 pain killers I had. I felt dizzy and nauseating after 30 mins but within 4 hours I was awake fresh. \n\nIdk what to do anymore with myself.",

You do it each and every day that you're still alive, that you are stronger than you are giving yourself credit for.\n\nI really think you need to see a therapist and a psychiatrist. If you need help finding one, call the phone number in your insurance card, and ask them for some phone numbers.\n\nYou can do this! You just need a little direction, you're a little lost right now.  I've been there!! Just get yourself into see someone, when you call and make the appointment, tell them that you are having suicidal ideations, and you really need in quickly.\n\n\nIf you don't trust yourself not to do it or something else again.  Get to the hospital. Tell them you are suicidal.  They will admit you, and you can stay seeing a doctor immediately, and then before you leave there they will put you in contact with someone to see outside of there.\n\nYour life has worth.  I know you don't see that right now, but it does. And it will get easier, I promise!!",

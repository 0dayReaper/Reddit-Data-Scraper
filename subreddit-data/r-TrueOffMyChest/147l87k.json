    "postText": "I was 7 years old at that time and I would always see him watch porn all the time even in broad daylight, even when i\u2019m beside him etc. i didn\u2019t know what it was until I grew older. When he watches porn, he\u2019d always ask me to give him a hug, sit in his lap, lay beside him. He would give me candy from his mouth by having our tongues touch. He would poke his thing on my butt and i would always feel uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t say anything because i thought it was normal. \n\nThen, one time he asked my mom to buy us food for dinner. We were left alone in the house and that was the time when he decided to french kiss me on the bed. I will be on top of him and we did it for god knows how long. When my mom came back I heard her calling for us to let her inside and I clearly hear that she was panicking. When i let her inside she asked what we were doing and I said we were sleeping. I think she knew deep down my dad would do something like that to me. But i didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nThat was the last time it happened. There were times where he tried to advance on me but I never let it slide. \n\nI grew up resenting him so much. Not because he raped me but because he would verbally abuse us, and cheat on my mom a bunch of times. I always feel gross out because he might think that i \u201cliked\u201d it. Still gives me shivers.\n\nI think i forgave him because we are both civil now. But i will never forget that moment. I plan on telling my mom if my dad dies first. But if that doesn\u2019t happen, i\u2019ll keep this secret till the day I die.",

She should be protecting you.\n\n\n\nIf you can - be it via school or college or some other member of the family - get some therapy to process the abuse you've been through.\n\n\nI'm sorry you went through it all but it isn't your burden to carry alone and it isn't your duty to protect your parents.  I wish you well.",

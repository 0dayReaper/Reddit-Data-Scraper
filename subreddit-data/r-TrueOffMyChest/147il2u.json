    "postText": "\nIn recent months I\u2019ve been able to cope, the times where I don\u2019t feel anxious have gotten longer so that\u2019s how I know I\u2019m getting better. So if you\u2019re reading this and you struggle with anxiety I want you to know that it will get better. I promise, I haven\u2019t even gone to therapy yet and I\u2019m feeling better than I did a year ago. Which is when I started to have the attacks. But that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m free of it. For the past few days my anxiety has gotten the better of me, it\u2019s nothing major but it lingers with me all day. \n\nBut for the past few days it as if somebody is waking me up, and I look around my apartment. All the things I have, my dog, my girlfriend. They all seem strange. As if it\u2019s not my home, and these aren\u2019t my things, and that isn\u2019t my dog or my lady. I\u2019m in the bathroom and it feels like I\u2019m in somebody else\u2019s bathroom, I\u2019m watching TV and it feels like I\u2019m on somebody else\u2019s couch. I feel like I don\u2019t have a home sometimes. Like this place isn\u2019t where I belong. But that only lasts a moment, then I snap out of it and I start to slowly reconfigure my surroundings\n\nBefore I started to have my anxiety attacks, I was really good at handling stress, I\u2019ve been hours away from a full fledged eviction and I didn\u2019t flinch. I did what I had to do and got it taken care of. But now as I write this I think about the errands I have to run tomorrow and it stresses me out to the point of not wanting to do it. And I get slightly overwhelmed. I\u2019m at the point in this week where I only feel okay when playing video games or watching tv. But I don\u2019t want to use escapism to cope with my problems. But anybody who\u2019s experienced anxiety the way I do knows how uncomfortable it can get. Sometimes I feel hopeless, like there\u2019s nothing and nobody that can save me. And something like taking my own life is the only option. \n\nI know this will pass, but apart of my journey to overcoming anxiety is learning as much as I can. So if there is anybody who\u2019s experienced something similar please share your story with me, and how you where able to cope. I know I\u2019m not alone. Not only is anxiety one the more scarier emotions if left unchecked, but it\u2019s also the most narcissistic emotion as well. \n\nSo please share your story with me",

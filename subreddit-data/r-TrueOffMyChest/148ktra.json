    "postText": "i (21F) started dating my coworker (22M) three months ago. i spent years purposefully single so i could work on myself and my trauma. i never wanted to hurt anybody by being toxic or emotionally abusive, because i know what that\u2019s like. nobody deserves that. but unfortunately, that\u2019s what happened.\n\nwe worked together for about two years and he started pursuing me about 9 months ago. i finally felt like i was ready. even now, it hurts retelling the story because i was so excited and so in love and i still am. he was the best thing that could\u2019ve happened after all those years of working and waiting. handsome, talented, the chivalrous type who always got me flowers and opened car doors. he always made me laugh and comforted me when i cried. cooked dinner, made coffee in the morning. it was like something out of my childhood fantasies.\n\nbut slowly, i started to break down. why? stupid reason; i was terrified of losing him, so i started to push him away. little arguments started to linger, and over time my clinginess and constant need for reassurance made him feel like he didn\u2019t do enough. that i couldn\u2019t appreciate him. i was dealing with chronic health issues and desperate need for therapy, but with no luck on health insurance, i was no longer myself. i was annoyed, i was passive aggressive. emotionally numb and incapable of stopping our relationship from plummeting amidst a sea of our shared confusion. 3 months crashed and burned just like that.\n\nbut that\u2019s not even the guiltiest part. it wasn\u2019t enough to wake up in agony every day over a broken heart and a beautiful life i could perfectly visualize being yanked out from under me by my own hands. no, i continued to push him. i couldn\u2019t give him the space he deserved. i couldn\u2019t get myself together again and every day i nearly lost my mind until finally i blew up on him and said things i will never be able to take back.\n\nwe left on a good note, i had written him a love letter. we planned on seeing each other again in a month, two young hopefuls with open minds and open hearts on continuing our relationship. and i shattered it. so badly that i told him i wouldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t, blame him if he never reached out again.\n\ni don\u2019t know how to live with the guilt. i don\u2019t know how to grieve this relationship. i still love him until the ends of the earth. i knew the moment i had feelings for him that he was someone i could marry. someone i could love unconditionally. and i still do, and i still pray for that second chance to love him the right way again.\n\nstarting therapy next week. if the man in question happens to see this, love you and best wishes.",

He's lacking impulse control and he obviously doesn't care about hurting a loved one physically. It escalated once and it will probably escalate again. He already crossed that line, it's easy for him to do it again. Don't leave your baby alone with him! The baby crying or interrupting whatever he prefers doing instead of caring for them might provoke another violent outburst. A parent who's punching walls out of anger alone isn't someone I would trust my child with and he hit you so hard you passed out! Don't give this man another chance to hurt you or your child. Leave. You are not a SAHM, you are the breadwinner, you can leave. Do it for your child if you can't do it for yourself. Statistically, chances are super high this will escalate further and you will not be safe! Please don't force yourself and your child to live a life with someone like this! \n\nThat being said, medically speaking you should see a doctor if you can afford it. Head injuries hard enough to make you pass out can be super dangerous, never fuck around with a head injury! Symptoms may not occur right after the incident, it can take hours to days and someone needs to take a look at your head! Look for a hospital that also does work with victims of abuse, they can take photos and document everything. They won't do anything about it unless you want them to, but in case you decide you want to file a police report, you do have evidence. It will be helpful in case you're filing for divorce though. Please take care of yourself and your child and stay safe! I'm sorry you're going through this!",

How much parenting could he possibly be doing if he\u2019s gaming that much? Even if he played literally the entire weekend through without sleeping while you were at home to watch the baby, that still leaves over 50 hours in the week that he filled with video games\u2014more than a full time job! He\u2019s a stay at home bum who is most likely neglecting your child to at least some extent\n\nalso, if you have visible injuries from him knocking you unconscious, document them to use as evidence. and GO TO A HOSPITAL if he hit you hard enough to make you black out. don\u2019t play around with head injuries. having a medical record attached to the assault will help you as well",

Planning is everything that makes your life that much better later for when you do leave him. Start taking cash out of accounts and store cash in a safe deposit box or trusted family/ friend. Start selling off items you\u2019re not going to need. Even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth anything someone somewhere will want it. Yes. Go to the hospital and report that your spouse punched you in the head. And then keep that discharge papers as they will write it on that paper. Go file a police report at the office or online. Making a report doesn\u2019t mean charges will be filed nor does it mean the police will come out. It\u2019s just documentation. You need as much documentation as possible because when you file for divorce this will help you in getting more custody (not all, but more) because he is a stay at home parent you might have to pay him spousal support. So really it depends how long of a game you want to play. If you can put up with it for a year so you can save as much money into an secret account and then if he hurts you again you can take time off work for mental health reasons. That\u2019s when you file for divorce as nobody is working and then you don\u2019t have to pay him spousal support. So plan ahead if you want to leave.",

This is not the reaction of someone who is regularly punched in the face. Therefore it is completely reasonable to ask why her husband would punch her in the face considering he doesn't have a history of this. Obviously \n\"My husband has punched me in the face for the 15th time and I don't even know what to do\"\nThis statement would warrant a completely different response. I would then say, call the police, leave his ass and hit that mofo with a frying pan on the way out. Do you see how context matters?",

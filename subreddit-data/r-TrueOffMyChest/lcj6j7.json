I work at a resturant and the amount of people who walk in without a goddamn mask is appalling. You would never guess we were in a FUCKING PANDEMIC with the amount of maskless people who walk in. \n\nWhen I politely ask them to put a mask on, I will get people who comply, but then I get people like \u201cI can\u2019t wear one I have a condition\u201d when I see them smoking outside the resturant. Or I\u2019ll get someone saying \u201cbut I\u2019m going to eat\u201d. \n\nThe worst part about all of this is wearing a mask is LITERALLY THE BEAR FUCKING MINIMUM AND PEOPLE STILL REFUSE TO LISTEN TO INSTRUCTIONS. THERE IS A SIGN ON THE DOOR. IF YOU CANT FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS, DONT GO OUTSIDE. IF YOU DONT WANT TO WEAR A MASK, DONT LEAVE YOUR HOUSE",

A young man who always says yes to covering for someone taking yet another shift when any of his co-workers had a sniffle or possible exposure, or when things were really bad and all the older employees at the station stayed home for a month so he said \u201cyes, I will work 22 days straight\u201d.  A young man who was making pizzas in the gas station kitchen all summer and still wore his mask the full 9 hours even though the air didn\u2019t work well half the time and the kitchen temp would get up to 110-120 degrees. A young man who is so thoughtful of other people he worked double shifts every holiday last year so his coworkers with kids could be at home with them. \n\nThis is my son, and this is who you are yelling at you selfish maskless jerks.",

Knock on wood! \n\nWe are extremely strict about masks and social distancing and all and do not eat out or go to any gatherings etc, so it must help. \n\nSide note: kids at school are absolutely awesome about masks on for the full day, even the little ones\u2014- a hundred times better than those adults who complain about putting one on for ten minutes in a store!",

It was serious and the treatment beat up my immune system, and there are long term (permanent?) repercussions, but I'm mostly past the worst parts.\n\nHowever, I came in to work more than I'd like as they laid off one of my guys and the other understandably left. Somebody needs to do this work and I'm the last one in my department (I'm a \"hands dirty\" manager). I come down into our production area and there's a guy with a mask down below his nose who lowers it below his mouth when he talks. Says \"I have a health condition.\"\n\nResisting the urge to feed him his nose I speak to his manager who says \"Oh, he's a good guy, he means well\".\n\nNO HE FUCKING DOESN'T HE'S A STUPID ASS ~~FUCKKNOCKER~~CHUCKLEFUCK AND HIS COMFORT IS NOT THE SAME AS MY LITERAL 17 LBS OF LOST FLESH!\n\n*ahem* sorry. You definitely have my sympathies. I'm lucky in that I could walk out if it *really* came down to it. I'm really, really sorry you probably don't have that option.\n\nEdit: I like chucklefuck better. My new favorite word.\n\nEdit2: It was a troll response, but in case anyone has legit questions on his 'health condition': no he doesn't and HR - as much as they're allowed to say - has confirmed such. I know a little more but I respect his privacy more than he respects my health... which I suppose is any more than zero.",

Obviously you've got assholes who argue with employees who don't have a say about company policy, but people act like if you don't wear a mask you're making a political statement. Conversely, it's entirely for political show if you are going to only wear it when you walk into a restaurant, then take it off once you sit down. Hell, if you are eating out at a restaurant during a pandemic, you're just as much to blame as the anti-maskers. And don't get me started on the God damned chin diaper people. I find that more infuriating than anyone wearing a mask, or not wearing a mask. At least they have some conviction.",

Anyone who thinks bringing only an ounce of liquid or only tweezers on a plane can't bring it down are just stupid. C-4 fits in very small places, but large enough to blow the pilot's door off. Just as spit hangs in the air for 8 minutes and moves around with the airflow. \n\nI do not submit to arbitrary social authority, so I don't go to any restaurant that requires you were a mask in or when you get up from your table. SHEEPLE, right?? What're ya gonna do?",

Droplets travel only a certain distance and some infected individuals emit tons of viral particles from just regular respiration (this has been known since February, probably earlier by infectious disease experts). When you're walking around breathing your chance to transmit to a stranger goes up compared to when you're seated a couple yards away. The biggest risk is when you're talking face to face with someone so whoever you're eating with (assuming you're infected) is most at risk. I'd guessing people sitting closest to you if they're sat more closely are at 2nd most risk followed by those you passed on the way to your table. People on the opposite end of the restaurant are least at risk. Masking while eating reduces transmission potential for those you walk past but does little to protect the people you're eating closest to or the person you're eating with.",

If people come in without a mask, we tell them they have to have one, and supply it if they don\u2019t. If they choose to decline, they are told to leave. If they cuss at us, we are allowed to give it back. \n\nThis job has ruined me on retail/service. Having the ability to defend yourself from being treated awfully by customers has given us a very good (for the most part) customer base. It\u2019s amazing when we have rules where we don\u2019t have to be victims of awful people, and can speak out to them, people are less likely to verbally attack us.\n\nMy boss is pretty good as well. Someone gets upset for what we say to their abuse and wants to speak to the manager? He goes off on them worse than we do. Someone escalates it to the owner? He goes off on them worse than my direct boss.\n\nIf company\u2019s are making employees enforce this, they should also allow the employee to defend themselves in the case of verbal abuse.",

    "postText": "Maybe it's irrational, but I feel scared of a school friend of mine. I used to be bullied in school, by some people. But when I left school I got so confused about who actually bullied me and who didn't because I was so used to being made fun of and taken for a ride..I had started overthinking things. I got over all of it, moved on well, but I'm still scared of this person because idk I feel that he'll do the same. Ik I'm strong enough to fight back but this guy was my friend in school and we would spend a lot of time together. I wouldn't like some things about him - his constant perversion and senseless jokes. He doesn't listen to me enough too, he's kinda impolite.\n\nHe's back in the country and wants to meet us(a group of friends from school) not sure if I'm interested. I hardly reply in the group anymore but thats been noticed and i feel odd for not being friendly enough with the group. I just dont like it when 2 of them are together, i dont vibe with them. Otherwise its fine.\n\nI just want to feel okay and not like those days when I would be scared.",

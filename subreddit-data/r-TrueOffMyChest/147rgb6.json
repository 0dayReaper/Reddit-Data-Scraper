    "postText": "I (20f) have always adored my sister (26f) and my beautiful nephews. However recently my sister asked me to come live with her over the summer while her kids were away and I wasn\u2019t in school. Although my parents told me not to sue to her history I didn\u2019t listen. I moved in with her and my first night she took me to the strip club to get a job because I always talked about wanting to be a dancer. Another important thing is that we are both sugar babies and we were talking to the same sugar daddy let\u2019s call him Remy. So me and my sister decided to get him to take us both on dates. I noticed he was a lot more touchy with my sister however I really didn\u2019t care because I already have a boyfriend and just wanted his money if I\u2019m honest. He would come see me at the club and we honestly had good conversation and formed a good friendship as he knew it was strictly platonic. My sister started to get jealous because she was always mean to him and demanded money while I asked him for money for practical things like when my tire blew out or helping with medical bills. Eventually Remy\u2019s last straw was when she offered to have sex with him in exchange for $1000 and he got mad as he was not looking for a prostitute. This set my sister off and she accused him of favoring me over her. While I was working at the club she sent me a long text saying I couldn\u2019t live with her anymore. She was also concerned because she would often have her baby daddy over and claimed she didn\u2019t trust him around me. Again I have a boyfriend no other man interests me in that way and I make sure they all know it. I told her I\u2019d be gone by the morning and went back to my parents house absolutely crushed. Everyone was on my side because it was a fucked up thing to do to your own sister. I told her she will always be my sister but we are no longer friends. I then blocked her on everything. Come to find out she\u2019s been talking to out mutual friends saying that she kicked me out for being a stripper when she was the one who got me the job. She also told our sugar daddy that I had diseases and a reputation. Also saying I was trash and saying she could take my boyfriend if she wanted to. I am so hurt because not only did she kick me out but now is spreading lies about me. I genuinely wanted to make amends because I want to see my nephews grow up but at this point I want nothing to do with her. It is taking everything in me not to tell people about her trying to prostitute herself to multiple people and how she was the one having to constantly get tested for sleeping with guys that have girlfriends. And how much of a deadbeat mom she is. But I am trying to be better than that. Most importantly better than her. I just needed to get all of this off my chest.",

Also maybe clear the air with the guy so that he can see what kind of person your sister is and and let things happen as they should. People will see she's a liar",

    "postText": "My mom, aunt and grandfather have been diagnosed with cancer in the last year or 2. My mom passed a few months ago, and my aunt last night. I\u2019m still a bit shocked my grandfather, who\u2019s 86 managed to outlive them both. \n\nI\u2019m yet to open the box where I\u2019ve put all the grief and guilt about my mom\u2019s death and now with my aunt, it\u2019s like cancer is everywhere I turn.\n\nTwo months before my moms passing, I had surgery to remove some abnormalities and get a biopsy done to screen for cancer. And 2 weeks ago, I go for a follow up to find, the abnormalities have returned and I have to do the same surgery as well as I\u2019m being referred to a oncologist. \n\nI feel so overwhelmed and I\u2019m scared to death that I\u2019m next and my grandfather might outlive me too.",

You never know.\n\nCancer isn't uncommon, but it also sounds like your family is getting hammered all at once, which is a bit of a statistical outlier.",

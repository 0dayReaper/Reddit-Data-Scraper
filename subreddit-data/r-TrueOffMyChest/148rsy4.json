    "postText": "(I'm on mobile so I'm sorry and I just got off work also this is kinda a vent like thing) \n\nHi I (18f) started dating my bf (20m), his birthday was yesterday and we became official 03/03/23. \n\nI couldn't tell anyone in words how much I love this man and how much he taught me. I work for his company and soon I'll be making a decent amount to afford a decent life I wasn't given as a kid. He makes me sooo happy like no one has ever made me this happy or enjoy life like this. I can truly be myself around him and it's awesome that he brought out the car enthusiast in me like I was when I was little. \n\nNow the part that makes me feel lost and genuinely sad is that his family has money. His dad has five cars, two lovely properties and runs four businesses. I'm that kid who was abused in many ways, fostercare and couldn't go back home. I've never felt this ashamed of where I came from until now because I've had over thinking anxiety moments if this were to ever happen. \n\nI feel so tight and locked up from them. Like I'm not supposed to be here type feeling/thoughts. Yesterday was the moment I finally cried because I feel different. His dad spent 400 maybe more for a bearded dragon. I got him into reptiles and such. His dad's words were \"See how much I spoil my kids?\" Yes sir I do. I felt like he's been hinting at me that I never had that. No, no I never had that, I was happy for my bf because well I'm the first girlfriend everyone in his family likes. His dad did say I'm an amazing girlfriend but I just can't shake it. \n\nI wasn't fond of rich people because of my fear and sadness. The reason it makes me sad is because I'm trying for my mom both biological and adoptive. I told my adoptive mom once I get a good job I would by her a Jeep like she always wanted. My biological mom has all my brothers and is a SAHM with a suffocating life. My adoptive mom seems content and happy. \n\nI live with my bf and I don't need much to be happy but watching them go on trips, car rallies and knowing a few famous people hurts. I feel like I'm just a shadow to them. I'm there but not much is seen. They like me but I feel like they see me differently. My bf tells me that I'd be better at a lot of things because I'm that one unlucky kid. I have more than he does because he said he had a silver spoon. I had nothing really. Just hoping to make it go forward. \n\nHis dad did the middle finger thingy with glasses if you know what I mean. I wear glasses too. And said kids are expensive. I said I can confirm, after I said that he did the middle finger thingy. I don't have kids nor would I want any and we had that conversation a bit before this event. Like weeks ago I think. \n\nI just want to feel equal but I don't because of where I come from past and present. I live in my head a lot and think the worst sometimes. I can't drive yet, learners permit. So I can't drive around for clarity. \n\nThis may be jumbled up mess but I tried my best. All I want to do when I think this way is cry. I'm sorry but I hope you guys are able to understand.",

You probably know what it means to work hard, to be hurt, to be in tough situations. Be proud of that because those are life experiences that you can turn into doing something good for others one day. Maybe with his money Lolol jk but bottom line - don\u2019t make yourself feel so small just because they have big money honey. Be YOU to the fullest!",

It's hard to accept because everything something nice came to me, down the road it was hell. I guess I'm also afraid of that..",

There\u2019s things we can\u2019t control, but the few things you can control is to not shrink your self worth, don\u2019t live in fear, and how you present yourself. Go with the flow and enjoy it! I hate to be so 2015 but YOLO",

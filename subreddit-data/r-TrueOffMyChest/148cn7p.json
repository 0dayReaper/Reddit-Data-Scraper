    "postText": "No matter how hard I work and try, something always comes up to overshadow everything I've done. I say something wrong, he doesn't like that I left something out, or I'm so stressed that it stresses him out... But I'm already stressed to the point where I can't look \"normal\" or happy.\n\nThere's been too many conflicts to the point I don't want to open up about anything. If he needs to pay me back I don't bring it up. If I need help I won't ask, because sometimes it goes badly or I feel terrible for asking, so it's just easier to not.\n\nI don't want to people please. I'm not like that. But I'm feeling more and more distant. Too many bad things have happened over the years and I'm always the bad guy. I don't want to be close to, talk to or touch someone who I've had so many negative interactions with.\n\nYet when I say I feel it's better if I were elsewhere I'm hit with \"don't you want to fight for us?\" and \"if you really don't think this relationship is worth it then go.\"",

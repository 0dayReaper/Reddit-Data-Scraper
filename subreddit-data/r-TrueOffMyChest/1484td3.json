    "postText": "So I was raised by my grandparents because both of my parents were strung out doing their own thing and couldn\u2019t take care me at the time (drugs are more important right?) so I was pawned off on my grandparents to be raised. My papa has an older son we will call him L. L Is his biological son. When L had his own son my Grandpa helped him fund his company $100,000 cash $60,000 brand new personal truck $20,000 work truck another $90,000 in digging equipment and trailers. L has been a heroin addict the past 6 years (obviously lost his company) and with this comes jail, lawyer and court cost. My papa has EASILY given him over $500,000 for everything. I even worked for L a while back (new company) until he tried to not pay me and my papa said \u201cI should negotiate my pay and be happy I\u2019m getting something\u201d. Well papa bailed out Logan and payed my pay for Logan. My car recently broke down and is trash. I\u2019m trying to buy a new used car. All I ask is for my grandma to co-sign (I\u2019m 19) because her credit is 800+ I\u2019m paying for EVERYTHING and never asked for a single penny. He\u2019s saying she shouldn\u2019t help me whatsoever. I\u2019m not even asking for money?? Yet he\u2019s willing to do all of that for L?? How the hell is this fair and I\u2019ve told him he shows favoritism and used prior examples but he denies it. I\u2019m thinking I will bring the topic back up because it makes me so angry and hateful and resentful towards him and L because what did I do wrong?? I never wanted to be their burden because I know that\u2019s what they think of me. Yet my nana is willing to do anything and everything to help me despite not having much she makes $12 an hour and is willing to help me and even sign but is scared about how angry he will be. He is a semi driver and makes awesome money. I\u2019m not asking for money. Just a co-signer. Am I asking for too much? I just don\u2019t understand and can\u2019t even process all the emotions because I can\u2019t believe the blatant favoritism anymore.",

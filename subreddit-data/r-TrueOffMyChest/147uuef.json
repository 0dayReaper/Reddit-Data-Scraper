I know you feel it too, the romantic connection we once shared, is gone. It has been for awhile now.\n\nWatching you become a father, is what ruined us. I thought we were indestructible. Turns out we were both just good at hiding how things really were. We both were looking at each other with rose coloured glasses.\n\nWe clearly can't stand each other anymore. So why are you still here? You say you love me, but I honestly don't think that's true anymore.",

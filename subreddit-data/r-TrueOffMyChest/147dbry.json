    "postText": "Hi folks,\nYesterday my cousin shared with me that two years ago she was groped by a relative of ours while he was visiting their house. She had tears in her eyes. She said he came from behind her and tried to hold her breasts and that she was in shock and did not react but just got away. Now one problem with me is that i clearly dont know how to handle an emotional situation. I feel like i did not support her well enough considering I'm the first one she's telling about this. I'm pretty sure she expected more comforting from me while i just kept saying that i never expected him to be such an evil man. Now i feel so bad that i didn't support her and i feel like bringing it up again will make her even more sad ?. Clearly don't know what to do. Feeling like i messed up.",

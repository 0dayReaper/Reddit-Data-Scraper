    "postText": "One night, when I (36f) was about 8 or 9 years old, (mid 90\u2019s), my father took my little brother and I to Blockbuster to pick out movies. We left there and my dad stopped at a corner store for some snacks and he parked on the side of the building. He left me and my brother in the car while he ran in. On his way out, a man came up behind him and held something to his side. My dad, pretended he was going to hand the man his wallet, but he instead elbowed the man in his face and he fell to the ground. The guy got up and came at my dad with a knife and my dad fought it away from him and stabbed him with it. It was long and that shit went all the way in. The guy let out this horrible groan. I can still hear it. He left the guy on the floor writhing, hopped in the car and took off. \n\nFor so many years I thought this was a dream until my little brother mentioned it to me when asking if I remembered. We\u2019ve NEVER brought this up to my father, ever. I\u2019ve always wondered what happened to that guy, but this was way before cell phones and stuff so who knows. It\u2019s crazy the weight that comes off of someone when they say things they\u2019ve always been holding in.",

It was so foreign to her to *need* a decoy wallet in case of robbery, because there it was actually a life and death scenario. And especially the many tips that followed of \u201cold, used wallet so the robber thinks this is your main one\u201d and \u201cbills placed a bit scatterly so it\u2019s very visible that there\u2019s several when handing it over\u201d. All this to maybe improve your chances of maybe pleasing a desperate robber at any freaking time and day. Yet still risking your life despite it all.",

It's such a small place that if someone tried to rob you, you'd know who it was, and the response is more of a \"Ricky fuck off or I'm telling your wife!\" And he'd just leave. That and nobody here owns guns really other than for hunting.\n\nLast time the police made a fb post of a bust theyd made. They actually seized a gun, it was an old war rifle, single shot, with a bayonet lmao. Everyone in town down in the comments like \"Greg you fucking idiot, your grandads gonna deck you for losing that!\"",

We started dating and decided to get married - this was a few years ago - and applied for her permanent residency.  She got pulled over while going to the grocery store when we were in the 'grey' period between her visa auto-expiring because of our marriage and not yet getting approval for her Green Card.  She had a taillight out - cop just cared that she had her driver's license, insurance and registration.  \n\nIn general, they don't want to prod, because they don't want to get sued or investigated for stereotyping.  They have to have a good reason to ask where you come from.\n\nAnd whoever says that residing illegally in the country isn't a criminal offense is off their rocker.  Illegally entering, overstaying visas, etc absolutely are criminal offenses - you're likely to be deported if you do it - but you absolutely can go to prison for it.  Whoever says that honestly has no clue what the difference between a civil and criminal offense even is in the first place.",

It can be an extremely traumatic experience in someone's life when you're standing there, looking someone in the eyes knowing full well if you don't think and act fast that crowbar is going to buried in your head. All compassion for your \"fellow man\" goes out the door and the brain goes into \"survival mode\" and you do what you have to do to survive. After a while you come out of \"survival mode\" and you start to realize exactly what happened and what you did. This is when the Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or PTSD starts. You feel horrible for having killed or severely injured someone but on the other hand you could be the dead or severely injured person had you not reacted the way you did.\n\nWhat you're dealing with is basically the same thing military people go thru that have seen combat. You can't look at someone's face thru the scope on a rifle and not feel some type of empathy for them but you know full well that they have cross hairs on you. He who hesitates is going to die.\n\nFor what it's worth I have PTSD myself due to a violent crime. I couldn't resolve it on my own and had to get professional help. If you find yourself playing the mental tug of war game, having nightmares or just can't process and put away the experience get some professional help.",

My dad is a civilized guy until you piss him off and his number one hot button is Thieves. We were leaving an Oakland A\u2019s game and he parked a ways from the stadium. We were just about to the car when my dad saw two guys, one in the car and one keeping watch. He ran right up to the guy keeping watch and smashed his face so hard the crunch sounded like a carton of eggs being stomped on. The guy immediately was knocked out and hit the ground as if he was thrown into it .\nMy dad then ripped the other dude out of the car by his feet, picked the guy up by his neck and began to smash his face over and over into a newspaper vending machine we parked next to. He must have smashed the guys face at least twenty times until he decided he had more than enough. He turned and told me to get in the car and I wasn\u2019t gonna argue with him. He let the guy go and dropped him where he stood. I remember the guys blood covering the side of the box. The other guys blood was pooled all around him. \nOn the way Home he turned to me and said \u201cDo not tell your mother\u201d",

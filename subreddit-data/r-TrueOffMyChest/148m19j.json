    "postText": "I'm 23m and I was in an abusive relationship for 4 years that ended with me walking in on my ex gf and a dude I didn't know. It shattered not only my heart but my entire sense of what reality was. She sexually abused me without a shadow of a doubt as well as abusing me in pretty much every other category. It was awful, but I was so deep in a web of manipulation that I just let her do it to me because I was in love with her. \n\nBeing far removed from the relationship now, my life is moving on and I feel like I'm getting to actually be a young person, I feel like a confident real person. That's all :)",

I looking back it's so obvious that I was being manipulated, abused, lied to, and absolutely controlled but during the time it was happening I didn't really notice it that much because it was such a slow burn. And then it's additionally hard to talk about being a guy because of the stupid stigma that if a guy is a victim of something that makes them \"weak\" or a \"beta\" or whatever kind of BS",

The abusive chick I dated even took advantage of me when I was passed out at a party months after we had ended things.\n\n  \nShe 100% sexually assaulted me, but na, she's a girl so she gets a pass. I'd be and still probably would be behind bars if I did some shit like that.",

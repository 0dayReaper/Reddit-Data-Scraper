    "postText": "So let me just start this with saying i am only 16 years old and i\u2019m aware that i still have so many years to find people. So me and my boyfriend have been going through things and it\u2019s been making me become distant. Things started getting rocky in October, we broke up a few times between October and December. December was the worst one but we learned the most lessons. It was good for a while in the beginning of the new year until about March and it got pretty bad again. Don\u2019t get me wrong i love this guy so much and i\u2019d die for him. But i\u2019m constantly getting hurt. And i\u2019ve started becoming distant and closing my heart and i get anxiety when we talk and i know it\u2019s not supposed to be this way. I saw somewhere that couples usually go through a rough patch near this time but i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s supposed to be this bad or last this long. It\u2019s hard for me to trust him and i have to force myself to talk to him. I love him but i\u2019m scared. And i cry every time i think about losing him and i can never bring myself to leave. I\u2019ve started taking more space than usual because it\u2019s the only time i feel at peace with myself. My friends tell me that i\u2019ll find someone else eventually and i\u2019ll be treated better but i don\u2019t want to love anyone else, i don\u2019t want to be with anyone else. He was my first everything and it hurts so bad idk what to do. But it\u2019s gotten to the point where i think about this every day. He can be really sweet and loving and we\u2019ve had a lot of good times and great memories but i\u2019m working on masking the bad things with the good memories. i just need help and advice.",

Still you need to leave and soon. Relationships should bring you joy and like you miss and want to spend your time with someone. You should feel calm, at peace and like they are your safe and happy place. Leave and go look for that.",

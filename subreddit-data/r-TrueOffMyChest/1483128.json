    "postText": "Trigger Warning: Substance Abuse and Suicide\n\nI (Chris 21M) had a friend Lucas(22M). We met in high school and hit it off. Lucas was genuinely a good dude on the surface. Then as the years progressed he started flaking on plans, if we made plans to hang out or do anything, 7/10 times he\u2019d have some bs reason to cancel. \n\nThen I find out he\u2019s been accused of rape( I know the woman he\u2019s accused of raping and she has no reason to lie), and he\u2019s been spreading false information around our friend groups back.  He\u2019s managed to piss everyone off, but what he said about me really bugs me.   \n\nI had a horrible relationship with my father (Tim48) who was in and out of my life from the day I was born to the day he died. He struggled with substance abuse and was a very cruel person. He overdosed in 2019. \n\nLucas knew about all of this. Come to find out he has been saying that I\u2019m using and will end up spiraling out and overdosing/killing myself just like my father. \n\nI don\u2019t know why i posted this really, but I just needed someone to vent to I guess.",

I didn\u2019t go into a lot of detail in the post but Lucas was my best friend for the majority of those 5 years. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I want absolutely nothing to do with him because of the choices he made. It\u2019s just fucking with me since he was there for me during some of my darkest days. I just didn\u2019t think he was capable of that type of thing.",

    "postText": "When I read descriptions of the guys muscles and height and most importantly how perfect there personalities are I'm reminded of everything I've gated about my self. I'm 5,6 which may not sound crazy short to you but after you read description after description of the nale love interest you realize height is relevant. I'm also not the most romantic. I'm what my father would describe as rugged. I have no problem doing a suprise dinner with roses in a vase, but there are just too many days where I'm just an irritable mess.\n\nThe worst part is I don't want a girlfriend. I don't even want to get married. \n\n(I have some issues in my amygdala that would make dating mr unpleasent)\n\nIt's this Idea that if I'm not like that women will hate me. I can't help but have this feeling women think of guy as either \"Man written by women\" or \"Ick\" and there is no in between. \n\nI want to like them because I feel like guilty about watching porn and that reading romance novels is less pathetic and more acceptable. I also just see how nice the community is to each other, plus I keep hearing about how men who read them understand women and \"Fictional Men &gt; Real Men\" \n\nThe problem is the moment the female character meets the male love interest I turn 15 again. Sticking my fingures down my throat to throw up food hoping it would make me skinnier. \n\nP.S. That doesn't work.",

            "comment": "It sounds like you have a lot of conditioning and ideas about what men \u201cshould\u201d be like that are confusing you. You are YOU and you are a unique person with lots to offer. I\u2019d suggest putting down the porn and the romance books for a while, both are complete fiction and not at all a realistic idea of what it is to be in a relationship. Women are diverse and they are looking for different things, so try not to get caught up in the idea that all women want this or that. One woman\u2019s fantasy is another woman\u2019s nightmare lol. I know it sounds cliche, but try to just focus on learning who you are, apart from all these other people\u2019s opinions. The more you learn to be who you are, the more you\u2019ll find people who appreciate you:)",

All of his friends are min. 6'x and he sticks out if you see them as a group. But once you see them interacting you just don't notice that anymore. Being shorter than the average here just isn't on his mind and therefore he isn't overcompensating that.\n\nI've other male friends who are also 5'6\" and they act different. You see them and just know that they are on the shorter side of life even though they aren't standing. \n\nIt really is a lot about attitude and how you perceive yourself. And again, there are women who have a check list of male attributes they are following along but there are also others who are looking for different things in a partner.",

I don\u2019t think your problem is unique but certainly can cause discomfort. The most important thing is you need to accept yourself and love yourself first. If you don\u2019t, how do you expect people to love you back? Like the previous comments, there are so many people out in the world and everyone\u2019s likes and preferences are different. You never know who you will meet one day. But for now, maybe work on who you wanna be. Do things that make you happy. Build your characters. Don\u2019t sweat things you can\u2019t change like your height.",

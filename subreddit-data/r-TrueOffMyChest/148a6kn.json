    "postText": "I have a few close friends and they started smoking and drinking a semester ago. Now they have become addicted and smoking and drinking and that\u2019s they all want to do.\n\nWe used to study together, go to museums, and to fancy cafes. But now they have to smoke once or twice in one  hour. The group activities need to be centered around smoking like going to places with a smoking area or to clubs. Plus, I now find it lonely having to wait 10-15 minutes for everyone to go smoke.  \n\nI used to be extremely close with them all but I feel like I\u2019m the odd one out now. \n\nOne of them even said they\u2019re worried that I\u2019d judge them and made it so that I couldn\u2019t see their stories of them smoking. They all know I don\u2019t mind what people do as long as it doesn\u2019t affect me. It\u2019s none of my business. The reason why I\u2019m against doing it myself is because I come from a family of addicts. \n\nI love them and want to keep being friends with them. But maybe I should find a different friend group to spend most of my time with.",

It\u2019s the same with romantic relationships. It hurts and it\u2019s normal, so go and find people with the same interest you have and yo will be much happier for the long run.",

They did not care to do anything else jn a public setting they just wanted to hide somewhere and smoke all day...this was during highschool and tbh I regret I sticked with them. They self imposed smoking restriction meaning we could go only to this remote places where nobody could see them stole from me chances to meet new people and sociolize. Soon all they money were spent on smoking and nothing else so we could not hang out to clubs anymore. If i could go back I would suggest my younger self to ditch them and find more social people which can open new experiences for me and not same old same old shit.",

            "comment": "I\u2019ve been both the smoker and nonsmoker in a group so I can see both sides. In my experience I was never affected by it but usually when people first get into smoking, it becomes a big part of them where they center everything around it (hell, even I did). \n\nPeople change and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. However, it\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean that once you distance yourself you will never interact with them again. I grew apart from a couple friends groups once or twice but we found our way back again. Relationships aren\u2019t linear, they\u2019re more irregular where you have ups and downs and sometimes the downs can last a long time. \n\nIt\u2019ll be a good idea for you to find another friend group if you feel like you are growing apart from your current one. You can also chose when to be around them instead of cutting them off completely that way you won\u2019t be exposed to their habits all the time. Maybe try out limiting contact first and see if that works for you. Sometimes the people we used to be around 24/7 won\u2019t fit into our new lifestyle as we grow, and that isn\u2019t a bad thing, it\u2019s just life. I can\u2019t be around someone who goes out or drinks everyday because I\u2019m not into that lifestyle anymore and that\u2019s ok! There are plenty of nonsmokers out there (like me) who will enjoy going to museums or events with you. Tbh, that sounds like my kind of friend!",

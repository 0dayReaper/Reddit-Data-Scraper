    "postText": "I (16M) has been wanting to leave my family. I have 3 older sisters, two of them have small kids (10F, 4F, 4M, 2M) and mother and father. My family sucks. My father was verbally abused by his mother, was an accident child, so was my mom. My mom was abused by her mom as well, she was an accident and my grandma always picked her siblings over her. Even now when they're grown people my mom's side doesn't talk to us, honestly we think it's because they still think my older sister intuduced my cousin to his wife (he killed himself because if her). Even tho that I'd probably true, they still talked to his wife (she refused to let them see their son). Recently my aunt's husband died, from my family i found out he's been abusive to his kids and wife, he was always drinking, beer in hand. I never liked him anyway, even tho he got sober he still had beer in his hand everything i saw him. My dad was no different. He was always drunk, untill he got cancer a year ago. I knew all along. Memory that will stuck with me is when I was eating and he got mad cause my mom left something on the hall. He made me trow it in the trash and later i cried because of things he said. I can't even remember his words anymore. He told me he has cancer and I was crying more, not because he is dying but because hes speaking to me. I don't want to talk to him. My mom came home and she took it as me crying because he told me he had cance. Later on, we fought a few times and he would come in my room drunk. Kissing my head and that bs, after he did those things I felt discuss when he or my mom touched me, or anyone in practicular. I refused to sit where they would. Anyway, he got sober after his surgery. He wasn't home much anyway because he worked in Netherlands and we live cross the Europe. We didn't talk much, he would ask for something and I would bring it to him. I was just glad my parents didn't fight. With my mom it was something else, she was mentally abusive, manipulative and all those things. Last straw was something dumb. My two cats has 8 kittens and I got to keel one, i told my mom that u want the white one. She gave it to my little cousin and told me that i have another one just like the white one, but I've bonded with my kitten. It was mine. She gave me a half ass apologie and called it a night. My sister's were are always yelling at me. Two of them would make me cry because they called my clothes ugly and tell me they won't go anywhere with me dressed like that. Same with my hair. My third sister and I didn't even talk, but she was similar. I just wanna leave at 18 and never look back.\nI have a feeling no one will read this, but it's alright. If you read it thank you for reading. By the way English is not my first language do excuse me for any mistakes.",

            "comment": "If I had your family, I would want to leave also\u2026hell no, I\u2019d run away as fast as I can. \n\nYou have 2 years before you can leave. Can you do the following during that time?\n\n1. Get a part time job and start saving money. Hide your money from your family. If possible, some banks have student accounts that are fee free to put your money in. But make sure that account does not require an adult signature so your family cannot touch your money. \n\n2.  Find your legal documents-social security number, birth certificate, etc or whatever your country\u2019s equivalent is and keep them in a safe, hidden place. You will need those when you leave. \n\n3.  Work on your schooling &amp; grades, study hard. It is possible you could get a college scholarship. If college is not possible, possibly a trade school like auto mechanic or AC technician or carpentry. \n\n4.  See if your school has counseling services-you need to talk to a trusted adult about your family life and your depression. \n\nGood luck OP-I hope you can have the life you dream of one day.",

    "postText": "i (18F) met this guy A(22M) on nsfw twitter. it all played out nicely. we got to know eachother and stuff and i genuinely started to get attracted to him. since we're both nsfw accounts we started sexting obviously, nothing too bad. then the next day we would be talking like we normally would and then mid conversation he keeps throwing in lame ass dirty jokes and things like that. i wasn't necessarly trying to go there because i was busy and im not turned on all of the time. but he kept pushing and pushing and then he'd tell me that he's really horny and suggest that oh i would make it so much harder if i were to send him a pic of my kitty. the first few days i was like ok, maybe this guy is genuinely turned on by my body, so we kept sexting and stuff and he'd send me dirty talk texts of what he'd do to me. fast forward and we're here now. we followed eachother on ig (we both know what we look like) but that's not all. im pretty sure he likes me because he calls me pet names all of the time and specifically made his twt account private for me and also said he'd uninstall it because he only needed it for me and now it doesn't have a purpose anymore. oh and he also added my name in his bio to state that he's mine when we are literally nothing. im so drained because im pretty sure im always on his mind. he always texts me first when he wakes up and he answers my texts fast saying im his priority. i appreciate it and all but two days ago i told him that im not looking for a relationship or a situationship because im very busy with exams this year and he takes up most of my free time that i used to spend drawing. he didnt get mad or anything and we still talk. we haven't sexted in 2 days but last night he told me he was going to take a shower and he sent me a d pic. i replied as calmly as i could so to not suggest that i would want to play or anything (and we didn't by the way, thank god). A is hyper sexual and its mentally exhausting for me. i cant really tell if he actually likes me for my personality or if he's only keeping me because of my body. he's sweet and caring and i appreciate that he's taking his time throughout the day to text me but i specifically told him that im not the right person for him but despite that he keeps calling me his love. i am attracted to his looks and his personality but i cant help but notice a few red flags in him and i dont know what to do. he's nice to talk to but it feels like its all going down the drain once he gets horny. what should i do?",

I mean, he doesn\u2019t sound overly pushy, but he\u2019s not exactly listening either. Plus, if you\u2019re noticing red flags\u2026 it just doesn\u2019t seem worth your time to have to worry about this at all, let alone if it were more serious.",

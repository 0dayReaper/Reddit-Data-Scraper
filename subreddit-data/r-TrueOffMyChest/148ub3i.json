    "postText": "I F17 and my mom F49. This happened back in april, 2023. I had just gotten back from a stressful vacation, i have another post about that. I was having a hard time adjusting going back to school and dealing with the stressful situation that had just happened. I was glad to be back home with my dog, Autumn, at the time basically still a puppy, only about a year old and an australian cattle dog pit mix, surprisingly very small. She was very friendly and energetic. Recently she had been having some issues with my mom\u2019s dog, a male 13 year old bichon frise. Despite his age he was, and still is, very energetic. They would get on each others nerves and lash out at each other. One time Autumn drew blood. Even though i had tried everything to prevent this (i tried a lot of things) and i still feel terrible about it. My mom\u2019s dog was fine, but it was still a huge deal. Anyway that\u2019s not the point. Two days go by and i get home from school. I call for autumn and she\u2019s not coming. I look around, nothing. I turn to my mom to ask her if she knows where she is and my mom answers that she got rid of her. Gave her away to some rescue. I was distraught. I didn\u2019t talk to my mom for days. I looked for months for autumn, every day on multiple websites hoping she would pop up, even if i could just know she was okay. About 3 weeks ago my sister informed me why i hadn\u2019t been able to find her. Turns out my mom put her down while i was at school, and lied about it. I was broken all over again. She was my baby and now there was no chance of seeing her ever again. I emailed my local animal hospital to see if i could find out what they did with her body, even though i knew it was too late. It had been months. The animal hospital couldn\u2019t tell me anything since Autumn was under my moms account. Despite me paying for her, and getting all her shots done. So they couldn\u2019t give me any information. I can\u2019t look at my mom the same ever again. I understood why she did it but she didn\u2019t even speak with me about it first. If she would\u2019ve she would\u2019ve found out that i had been planning on moving out with Autumn to my dads house. They are Divorced, maybe i should\u2019ve told her. I thought i had time but now Autumn is gone. I don\u2019t know how to move on from this. I guess I just needed to get this out. Thank you for reading.",

I totally understand you may not even be thinking about pressing charges and if you don\u2019t, totally makes sense. \n\nJust a sad set of affairs. Animals friends are good friends.",

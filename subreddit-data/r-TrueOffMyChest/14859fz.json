    "postText": "I (19M) am back from college for the summer. I live with my mother and older sister (23F). Our father is deceased. My sister and I have had a difficult relationship for a long time, and I don't know how it all started. But for as long as I can remember, she's been taking her anger out on me. She'll yell at me, call me horrible things. It's gotten so bad that even her friends will ask her to slow down and ease up. This has been happening for so long. She's been mean to our mom, too, but it's worse with me. She's stayed mean to me. She treats me, so often, like I'm nothing. Like I'm this annoying pest that she can take out everything on. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's done something to me. Even the slightest hint of aggravation in her voice is enough to put me into this defensive mode. Her coming into the house after she's been gone for a while, her opening the door to her room a little too fast---everything just gets me freaked out. And when she does yell at me I'm filled with the most disgusting anger, and sadness. It eats away at me and I can't settle down until much, much later. I've ranted so many times to our mom in this state so many times, and I know it's weighing on her. Whenever I get like this, I try to make sure she knows I'm not angry at *her*, but I know it hurts her to hear all of it. Her husband is dead, and her children don't get along. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt's gotten to the point that if my sister's loudly watching videos on her phone at 1 in the morning, I'm afraid to ask her to turn down the volume because I'm afraid of her blowing up at me. For another example, there might be some days she and I both plan on going to the gym. The moment I find out she wants to go is the moment I decide not to. Because I just need to be away from her. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy brain has been changed by all of this. My anger, my fear, everything's screwed up with her. I don't know what to call it. But it's a pain I feel around her, no one and nothing else. I just want to know what's going on with me, and maybe someday have a better relationship with my sister. She's better sometimes, but I'm always afraid of when she'll go off again. ",

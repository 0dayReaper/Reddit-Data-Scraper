    "postText": "I (46f) divorced him (m50) around 10 years ago. We kept it amicable. I started the divorce. There wasn't any cheating on either part. We have 3 kids (f26, m23, m11) and we all moved to the US  while he stayed in our home country (my minor son and I moved on 2015 and I was able to get my older kids here on April 2020). \nTwo days ago he called me (which he never does, our communication is very scarce, mostly through texts concerning to our only minor child, my older kids call him every single day and our 11 yr old jumps into these video calls everytime) and told me the whole town is out to get him. He believes his neighbor is a powerful drug dealer who has bugged his phone and house and has hired assasins to follow him and intimidate him. \nThen he told me a very elaborate but logical course of events (time, people and situations are somewhat true,  I was able to corroborate some of them through distant family members but there is no apparent reason for these people to have anything against my ex husband, I mean anything at all, he doesnt do drugs, he keeps to himself, he lives a pretty normal lifestyle) that lead to him not being able to sleep for the last 3 days and the reason for his call. \nHe was panicking and asked me to call the police and get a gun to protect us because he was sure we were gonna be killed. He was also sure they were gonna kill him yesterday, and they were waiting for him to go out of the house. We managed to get some distant family involved and talk to him. They took him out of his house to buy food, and he got calmer through the day. Once nothing happened, he got better. I also learned this behavior started around 4 months ago, in a very insidious and slow way. His best friend, who I called to ask for help, told me he has been trying to reach out but he hasnt been able to get our contact info, but that my ex really needs help and a psychiatrist. My ex even installed security cameras in his house, and his friend says he stopped working last week, and all he does is sit and stare at the monitor. My older kids mentioned that, lately, he has been asking them to be extra careful with new people they meet and he mentioned something about his neighbor having a beef with him, but nothing serious or very detailed. Im not gonna lie. We are all heartbroken. I called him today, and even though he seems to be calmer, he still insists his phone is bugged, and he said he needed to get a new one. He has stopped communicating until he gets a new one, and one of the hackers he believes is attacking him can't trace/bug. \nLast night, he talked to my older son, and he agreed to go to a doctor, and my ex sister in law is gonna have one of her good friends there take him there. I know he truly needs treatment asap, and Im really worried. \nMy two older kids have jobs they love but have already decided to go back and stay with him so they can help him get treatment. They both agree that going right now will only make things worse, because he believes we are all in danger and asked us to never come back, so they want to try and convince him to get treatment and once he feels better, stay with him for some time.\nMy kids have been working hard to save money so they can get him to come to the US legally. They have not been here long enough to be able to start the legal process, but they have already paid a lawyer to help them with it since last year. We have already told him about this.\n I am praying, and if you are a person of faith, I would appreciate your prayers as well. I just needed to get this out of my chest,  I have been trying my best to behave like this isn't a big deal, to give my kids the confidence and the peace of mind they need, and also not to make my husband upset, but this is killing me inside. \nMy ex is a good man. He is a great father. We just grew apart, and life became unbearable for both of us while being together, we both started to get resentful of each other, and jealousy caused physical violence to start creeping in. But I still care about him. We were 15 years together, and he's the father of my kids. \nI can't pretend I don't care about this situation because I do. My husband has been very understanding. He knows he is the love of my life, and I  hope he truly sees this as it is. I am worried because if something happens to my ex, my kids will suffer tremendously.  I lost my parents a few years ago, and it's devastating. I don't want them to lose their father, not like this, not right now.\n\nEdit: paragraphs are my friends as suggested.",

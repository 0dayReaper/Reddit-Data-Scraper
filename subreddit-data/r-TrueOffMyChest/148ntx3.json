    "postText": "I'm French and my country is popular for feminism and as a \"straight she\" I should be calling me a feminist!\n\nBut no, the times (2 years) I was moved and living in Poland with my parents, where I could have accessed to therapy system (\ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7 doesn't have this system) I realized quickly that all bad behaviors of people both men and women are come from their mental healths, included the foods they eat can affect their moods and cause them happy or angry.\n\nBecause of that, I believed now misogyny is not real and feminism is not need. What I needed and people needed are just good mental healths and go to therapy, meet therapists for cheap price (free is better)\n\nAnd if every horrible behavioral of women and men are from bad mentals and needing to cure through therapy, light therapy and eat healthy foods and education.\n\nThen I'm not a feminist because therapy is a mother or father of good things, feminism is not a way to cure the world's badness things.\n\nSince I was back to the France from Poland and currently still living here, I'm tired of the preaching from other women and girls that I must be angry with men, superior to men or have rights to demand other females to become a feminist.\n\nI'm tired of the preaching from other men are standing for feminism too as they're male-feminists and that I'm a misogynist for not being a feminist myself.\n\nI'd rather hear men talk about men's rights than supporting feminism. I agreed men needed rights as the same as women as we needed therapists, not fights.\n\nI'm tired to hear about feminism, preaching by people about it in real life and on internet, even words by my family every single minutes.\n\n*Just my rant, just my off my chest, not my opinion, I'm tired already about the whole feminism because France is the home of it.",

I don\u2019t hate men, or believe I should hate men in order to be a feminist. I\u2019m a feminist in a classical sense - meaning that women should have the freedom to pursue what they want. Whether that be to be a homemaker and stay at home with kids, or to pursue a career and have kids, or to not have kids and travel, vote, work, play, whatever the hell it is they want. Hating men doesn\u2019t make you a feminist, is makes you a misandrist.",

People in general (men or women) start doing trends that spread so quickly on social media. Which in all actuality, isn\u2019t a good thing. We were all meant to do things differently than one another. It\u2019s boring when we all pursue the same thing",

They call themselves FEMINISTS. Especially more modern feminist thought as intersectional feminist theory where misogyny is not just a singular negative affecting women but highlights the different ways sexuality and ethnicity and gender intersect the way misogyny affects people and is employed towards people. \n\nINCLUDING MEN. Who\u2019re taught to reject ideas associated with femininity through their performative and toxic behaviour. Avoid vulnerability including therapy, perform to standards and expectations that you don\u2019t necessarily want, be \u2018the alpha\u2019 etc",

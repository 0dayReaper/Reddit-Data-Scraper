    "postText": "The title sounds misleading, I do love my bf very much, just this one thing is really starting to frustrate me about our relationship. I (28 F) and my BF (27 M) have been together for just shy of 2 years. We live together out of convenience mostly but also it is a pretty good arrangement. Where it starts to get frustrating is over the last few weeks my boyfriend has been getting  increasingly short with me. Normally I understand that some thing overstimulate him so I try to avoid them. I  dont drink anything near him and when we eat I sit far away or he has to play background sounds bc the sounds of eating and drinking overstimulate him. I understand this and most of the time it's not a problem at all. What's starting to become a problem is that he is overwhelmed at work with a new position, and some online language classes he is taking, and it's starting to become increasingly difficult to navigate our relationship without overstimulating him and then being treated poorly. He apologizes when I call him out, but it just keeps going on. Sometimes he isn't as easy to overstimulate, but he goes through periods where me being in the room is just too much, which is fine except I also live there. Recently the big things that he has gotten upset over include:\nI was biting my nails\nI laid down on the couch and didn't get up when he wanted me to\nI asked him to also come up with some dinner ideas for me to cook since I always make us dinner\nDinner took too long\nI was indecisive\nI asked him to get something from the store on his way home from work after he had forgotten the last 3 days in a row\nI was helping him with some homework (he is learning Spanish for his job, and I know some) \nI was humming\nI was fidgeting\nI was air drumming\nI wanted to go outside and show him something (he doesn't like being outside) \nI told him nobody is stopping him from adjusting the thermostat when he is home bc he wasnt happy I turned the AC up  (we are from Texas, it's too expensive to keep it in the low 70s all day)\n\nI don't want to break up I guess I just want to vent, or maybe someone has similar experiences and can help me learn to do better I guess? If you have any ideas how I might go about not letting this bother me it would be much appreciated.",

That\u2019s all fine and well.\n\nBut really think about how this is affecting you. Are you changing yourself to be smaller and more obedient? Are you carrying more ambient stress in your body? Is your light becoming just a little bit dimmer, all the time?\n\nDo you want all of that to continue for a year? Two years? Five years? A decade? Until you\u2019re old and most of your life is behind you?\n\nI want you to take some time alone to really think hard on these things. Like an hour. Ideally more, but an hour is a start. Just sit with your thoughts and how you feel about what comes up.",

            "comment": "As someone who gets overstimulated a lot, it really just sounds like he needs to become much better at communicating this to you when it's happening. Because there's often a point between being okay and being over stimulated that it could be mitigated by communicating that it's starting to bother you. If he's totally unwilling to do this, and start to recognize when he's getting upset, this sounds like a very spot on case of projecting (as in he has other stuff getting to him, such as frustrations for work or learning Spanish, that he's then redirecting and taking out on you over miniscule things) and a lot of the issue lies more within his willingness to look into himself deeper.",

There\u2019s getting  overstimulated and there\u2019s being absolutely unreasonable and just an irritable wanker.\n\nHow small are you supposed to make yourself exactly?

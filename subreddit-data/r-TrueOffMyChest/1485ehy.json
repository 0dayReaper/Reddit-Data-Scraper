    "postText": "To start off, I just need to rant. This post may be all over the place. I am a 21f. This has been a trend since sophomore year of high school. I date a guy for x amount of time, we break up, they start dating a new girl. Within a couple months, she ends up pregnant. This has happened 4 consecutive times. Part of me feels upset but I know it\u2019s just related to past trauma and not having a family who truly loves and values me as a person. Another part feels relieved it wasn\u2019t me bc I know the type of father they would\u2019ve been if I had the child. I do know I will have my chance someday, and that everyone has their own timeline in life for when things get accomplished. However, I feel as if I am well behind my peers as they are having careers, getting married and shortly pregnant after tying the knot. I am still in school for my chosen career and single. I have decided to remain single and focus on healing my inner childhood trauma. I know the people I\u2019ve dated in the past did not heal from the things that caused us to break up (there were issues on both sides), so I know there is the probability of those same issues developing within their new relationships which may ultimately lead to their downfall. I do not wish that for any of them and hope all things go well. I harbor no ill intent towards the women and hope they have a smooth pregnancy and delivery with a healthy baby. \n\nTo add, I was pregnant but miscarried at 7 wks. He couldn\u2019t come see me the night of the miscarriage bc he was going to a party with his cousin, and then the guy told me, not even 18 hrs after, he\u2019s glad he dodged that bullet. We broke up shortly after.\n\nI just feel a bit heartbroken for the things I could\u2019ve had. But happy that I\u2019m not in that position. A tad bit angry. Lots of mixed, complex feelings.",

Make sure it\u2019s with the right person and you\u2019re both completely stable in life first, financially and emotionally. THAT\u2019S the most important part. Not how old you are. You want to give your future kid a better upbringing than you got. And who wants to be a teen mom anyways? Where I live that\u2019s definitely *not* many peoples goals ;)",

The relationships with the most drama were the kids who got married fresh out of college and cranked out kids within a year or two. Some of them are ok, most of them never learned proper conflict resolution, and just emulate the same mistakes their own parents made. They stay so busy they never have the time to realize that their own parents were idiots just like they are. Human lives are incredibly long. They just feel short because you're still so early in yours. Take a breath, it will be ok. You're on the right track healing yourself. And you seem to have broken up with guys who just weren't right for you, so, well done. You're doing all the right things, just keep on going.",

You date guys who think that going to a party is more important than you miscarrying. You have zero self esteem and having a baby is not the solution l. Do something with your life.

I know that being 21 feels like your an adult and you should be adulting but that can't be farther from the truth! Your still young  and growing into the person you are meant to be! The job, partner and kids will come when they come so enjoy the ride while your on it! \n\nSide note, I know it can be a different for girls then it is for guys, societal norms are constantly enforcing this idea that girls need to mature faster then guys and need to act a specific way or do specific things to lead a fulfilling life but it's all bullshit. Take life at your own pace, you have plenty of time and your doing you. Keep on keeping on, you write your own story!\n\nTldr you got this, what will be will be and don't define where you should be or what your doing by what others are doing! Be confidante and proud of what you have achieved and look forward to what will come when you yourself are ready! Goodluck :)",

That being said, I'm glad you're very much aware that this is an opportunity for you to grow as a person. Focus on your career, go out and have fun, and meet new people. It'll come a long way for you for sure.",

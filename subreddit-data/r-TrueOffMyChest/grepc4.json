It doesn't make sense that we leave police discipline to the officers in their own department.  We need an independent commission responsible for police discipline, with the power to suspend and revoke someone's law enforcement license as needed.\n\nIf we do this, we can get rid of bad cops and protect the good ones.",

They should be a few cities over to prevent the type of direct threats you indicate. Or we can push our government to make it a federal law that all local PD corruption, crime, abuse, etc are actually federal crimes and let the FBI Handel all cases and investigations. Get rid of \u201cinternal affairs\u201d. \n\n&gt;  It's definitely a problem that's got to be dealt with higher up. We NEED better leaders and people in charge who ACTUALLY do their job in removing corrupt cops.\n\nThe \u201csee nothing say nothing\u201d mentality means a lot of the bad seeds gravitate upwards. They are willing to do whatever and break all the rules. The leadership ends up being more corrupt (as a percent) in most cases. If not the top - many of the senior staff (again by percent).  People at low levels who are most afraid of retaliation leave early. \n\nThe better approach is to tell the bad apples it doesn\u2019t matter how much power they gather. They won\u2019t be able to influence the oversight. Doesn\u2019t matter if your buddies with Jim for 20 years since you joined the force in Miami.  The guy investing you for beating a homeless manis flying in from New Mexico as gives zero shits about you.\n\nEdit to add: the DA is also walking a fine line with how things are structured. \n\nDo you want to be know for prosecuting your cops?  They have to work with you daily. They are going to go against you and make your life miserable if you take too harsh an action. It\u2019s much easier for the feds to prosecute since they don\u2019t care about local PD.",

A good cop means nothing if the person above them turns a blind eye, and that is most likely because one supervisor, hell, even three supervisors over 50 bad cops are outnumbered. \n\nIf you have 100 good cops, and 1000 bad cops, pretty soon you are only going to have 1000 bad cops.

He considered himself a rabbi and he specifically came to fulfill Jewish law. In many ways I do believe he was actually giving a stricter version of the law, by explicitly saying you couldn't just follow the law while violating the spirit of the law. \n\nThat being said, like you said, we also have the Bible explicitly saying that certain laws (like the restrictions on diet) did not apply. It doesn't even necessarily say it no longer applies to Jews. I don't think it applies to anyone per the New testament.",

Even in the Old Testament you could be forgiven, though it was done through different ways, by sacrificing an animal, the high priest would enter the part of the temple called \u201cthe Holy of Holies\u201d where the ark of the covenant was kept, it was the part of the temple where God dwelled and a curtain separated that part of the temple, the curtain was 30 feet tall and 4 inches thick. The high priest would sacrifice an animal there every year for the sins of all the people of Israel. Though with Christ\u2019s death, He was the ultimate sacrifice. Upon His death the curtain that separated the temple was ripped from top to bottom, this was a symbol to show that we are now worthy to be in the presence of God because Christ paid it all for us. Meaning: before the priest was to enter the Holy of Holies and perform a sacrifice, but now, our bodies are considered the Holy of Holies because the Spirit dwells in those who Christ has revealed Himself to, so we can go to God in prayer and ask for forgiveness, which restores the image of God that we are made in because of Christ. Now, sorry for all the context but it is needed to fully explain. The unforgivable sin is the sin of rejecting God. If you take the Lord\u2019s name in vein and continue to do so and have not accepted Christ, you are already committing the unforgivable sin which is rejecting God therefore none of your other sins are forgiven, but through faith Christ you are saved and your sins are forgiven.",

My mom has to have a Master\u2019s degree to be a counselor. We expect a cop with less than a year of education to understand how to deal with a crisis that is supposed to require 6 years of education? Nah.\n\nAlso, those degrees need to include a battery of psychological tests to ensure you\u2019re fit for the job and not just an abusive asshole looking for a power trip.",

Only 17% of the candidates passes all these tests and can start with the (paid!) training. If you succeed, then you have the lowest rank in the police rankings. In order to rise, you'll have to do exams and so on. I think it's a good thing, especially if you compare younger policemen to the older generation. \n\nBut, you'll always have rotten apples in every basket. I know some policemen that used their power to get things done from coworkers, or who used to thwart other colleagues in their ambitions, some policemen that abuse their power against some 'annoying' citizens..   \nOn the other hand, in our bigger cities, the law enforcement has serious issues with some groups of people who think the laws don't apply to them... and then you get some youtubevideos about surrounded officers who get a serious beating from a crowd ...",

I\u2019m a former police officer (with a bachelor\u2019s degree prior to my law enforcement experience), and I am all for making this a requirement, but only if the pay is increased across the board.\n\nYou run in to a few issues if this isn\u2019t the case-\n\n1) No one will want to do it (other than a select few individuals doing it for altruistic reasons, or out of a heightened sense of duty). Why take a starting salary of $35K-$45K for a job that can quite literally kill you, when you can take that same degree and get the same starting salary at some corporate inside sales job?\n\n2) Recruiting. A lot of what you see on Reddit (certainly not all, but a lot) isn\u2019t an officer acting out of racial malice or sinister intent. What you see are either the scared shitless actions of an undertrained rookie, or an overworked veteran in the middle of a 100 hour week, who\u2019s going to court instead of sleeping during his off time. As an aside, the 100 hours isn\u2019t me being colorful, that\u2019s entirely plausible depending on manpower needs of the department.\n\nA police recruiting crisis (which we are in now, make no mistake about it) is a double edge sword. It forces a department to relax hiring and training standards in order to fill positions, or they can maintain the integrity of those institutions, not hire anyone, and overwork their officers until they\u2019re fatigued enough to make judgement errors in volatile situations. This leads to a lot of what gets shared on Reddit as \u201cevil police officers\u201d.\n\nIf you want a better, more accountable police force; increase starting pay by a substantial amount and increase the hiring standards to attract better candidates.\n\nThis has been my TED talk.",

Administrators will do everything in their power to silence and cover up malpractice at every level, including massive payouts to silence victims and critics. A surgeon assisting another notices a mistake? Good luck getting them to rat on their partner. Also the state inspections? They give you months of notice, so the facility can beef up staffing and actually do shit right for a few hours. Then they're gone for another year while shit falls apart. \n\nI've done my small part, but nothing I did amounted to much besides a stern talking to. No matter what I do personally, these facilities continue to keep these terrible employees. Only when a family member gets involved is anything actually done. And most of the time, they're told to pound sand or move (Most patients I deal with are in extreme poverty, they can't move, they have no choice)\n\nIt's a tough choice that I struggle with. If I go through and report every single person doing something wrong, not only will I lose my career, I will be blacklisted from every facility within 50 miles from myself. I'll never work in the industry again. Every single hospital, rehab, long term care, etc. will never allow me in. I'll be a \"troublemaker\" and I've definitely lost out on promotions/pay raises from what little I have done up to this point. Last year I pissed off a major hospital/company in the US and I've never gotten approved for one of their facilities since. I've seen numerous nurses/CNA's flat out fired or relocated because they've reported things. It's a constant fear.\n\nBut if I let things slide and \"play the game\", I can continue to work and help as many people as I possibly can. I can at least help where I'm able, the ends justifying the means and all that.\n\nObviously I'm still working, and considering the current pandemic I am in extremely high demand, but I am struggling with it. If I do go full, balls out reporting every single terrible thing I've seen, I'll be homeless in a couple months. But if I keep working, at least there's a little light in all the darkness that surrounds healthcare. \n\nBasically I get it. I get why the cops aren't reporting their buddies. Don't think it's right, not excusing it at all, but I get it. I do the same shit, as every other healthcare worker does all the way from executive director to housekeeper, we all keep our mouths shut for the most part.",

Because the fear of being retaliated against, losing their jobs, or it following them around because people in given fields know each other and tell each other stuff like this. \n\nIf you were to ask any of them beforehand if they'd put up with racism at work, they'd all tell you no, of course not.

It's not life/death, but being unethical results in people losing all their assets and every penny they have. I have to do yearly updates on my knowledge, and the one I went to last year discussed ethics. It was a scenario where you had a choice between reporting unethical behavior that has severe consequences to innocent people, or pretending like you don't know anything. The situation was very clear that you have a family, and the consequences of reporting was that you'd have to move to another country to get a job in the same industry.  I remember I went out for lunch with everyone at that seminar, and this one guy was saying \"so, they expect us to give up our jobs, our careers, our future, they want us to force such a drastic change on ourselves and on the lives of our families, but no one does anything to compensate us. They want us to \"act ethically\" without any protection at all, fuck that, if it's a choice between me and anyone else, I'm choosing me\". Everyone agreed. \n\nIt's romantic to fantasize your willingness to smother the hand grenade with your body to protect your fellow soldiers, but in reality, it's just plain stupid. \n\nIt's not the other police officer's fault that this happened. The 1000 good cops continue to be \"good cops\". The 10 bad cops are still the only bad cops that are bad. The problem is clearly inherent in the administration since they are the ones that aren't doing their due diligence on good and bad cops. They probably have a financial interest, I don't know, do cops have to pay an annual fee to be a part of professional administration?  I know that's why my administration refuses to compensate people who rat out unethical behavior. If they compensate, they'll go bankrupt because half the \"professionals\" that pay them their annual professional dues will be in prison.",

I switched departments to head up their transportation division. And when I got in there... I could not believe the disastrous conditions the previous manager left it in. Or that the administrator had allowed to happen. It was half staffed, as in we only had half the people we'd need to have a \"normal\" day. I put in 75+ hour weeks for 3 months before I couldn't take it anymore. I reported every problem I had to the admins. We had multiple meetings where I literally told them this isn't working, you're fucking up, help me get this figured out. Half the damn lifts on the buses didn't work or the hydraulics would malfunction and could potentially drop a patient 5 feet to the ground. Most of my employees were sleep deprived and putting in 60 hour weeks and driving far too much than legally allowed (Technically you're only supposed to drive for 8-10 hours in a single day, anything beyond that is illegal)\n\nTurns out this was NOT the way to do things. Turns out I should NOT have been clocked in for all those extra hours beyond 40 per week. I should NOT have told any other employee about my struggles. I should NOT have mentioned the malfunctioning equipment putting patients at risk. I should NOT have mentioned the hours we were all driving because it was illegal as hell.\n\nSo what ends up happening? They take away my promotion. They put me in an entirely different position that I was completely untrained for and had the worst possible hours (basically on call from 3AM to 10PM, rain/snow didn't matter). I quit that place and was banned from the property. I lost out of tens of thousands of dollars. I'm basically at step zero now, doing the whole traveling CNA gig right now. Ruined my benefits, ruined my career trajectory. I may never financially recover from this (Tiger King meme, yes, but relevant).\n\nAnd all my reporting, you know what happened? Nothing. Not a damn thing. The place is chugging along like I was never there. Got some texts from old coworkers that they hired three people to do my old job and that was that.\n\nSo what did that teach me? Reporting will ruin you, no one will care, and you will have to fend for yourself once the dust settles.",

Even worse since a recent government nerfed their internal affairs ability to do anything. And some of our law enforcement are also a branch of the military so they have to keep silent by law.\n\nMost ethnic minorities are like that. We have a famous case when some of them harbored a group terrorists (that ended up doing a famous shooting). The trial of the people who illegaly rented them apartments and \"never saw anything suspicious\" was laughed at a lot. Various travelers are like that too, though on a lower level (mostly covering for petty crimes here). Asian community is quite tight lipped but in their case it's a parralel economy thing, law enforcement often busts illegal food production for restaurants (in apartments with apaling hygiene conditions), and the occasional underground clinic (literaly, those are run in caves in some big cities). In some cities there's a big Russian presence (organised crime) but here I understand why people stay silent because nothing will save you if they get angry.\n\nWe have a joke that \"tax evasion is our national sport\", so in some areas people know about each other avoiding taxes, working illegaly, and maximizing the welfare they receive (since they have no legal income).\n\nThen you have churches (diddling kids), teachers (also diddling, although they're improving), politicians (there even rivals from opposing parties will remain silent about each other because nobody wants to rock the boat), unions (mostly financial issues here).\n\nJudges but it's more complicated to explain (basically a judge can sometimes preside over a trial alone while also being in charge of the investigation, and some of them were known to not be impartial, but their colleagues didn't do shit).\n\nThe medical field used to be like that (almost impossible to convict for malpractice two or three decades ago) but they passed strong laws about record keeping that changed the game (every decision and even being put in the official record, punishing severely anyone who leaves a blank in those logs, allowing to cross check).",

Sergeant Jeffords, played by Terry Crews, is stopped by a racist cop near his house, and decides to report him. But Captain Ray Holt (Andre Braugher), who is both black and openly gay, advises him against it. \n\nHolt\u2019s reasoning is that reporting the bad cop will damage his attempts to further his career, and that instead he should focus on trying to advance through the ranks of the police force and try and change thing through the system, just as he had done. But Jeffords\u2019s reasoning is that advancing through the system will take years, and the bad cop is on the streets now.\n\nThey eventually take Jeffords\u2019s approach and report the officer. Jeffords then is passed over for a new Liaison role because of it.\n\nMy point is, it\u2019s a very delicate balancing exercise that police officers have to conduct. They can either do something now, and face consequences for going against a rotten system, or they can keep their head down, work hard to climb the ranks and use their power for good. And it\u2019s probably very easy to make a judgment about what the right thing to do actually is if you\u2019re not a cop yourself. Now, I don\u2019t know if you are one or not, but I know I\u2019m not, and I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place to comment.",

Because, again, being a fucking asshole isn't illegal.  You can't arrest someone because you think they may one day do something illegal, you need to wait until that person ACTUALLY does something illegal to arrest them.  You need to wait for them to ACTUALLY do something against the rules before you can report them to IA.  You're looking at this with 20/20 hindsight but you can't actually take any action against these people until they've ACTUALLY done something wrong and by then you're screaming that all the cops are bad cops because they didn't prevent the bad cops from doing whatever they did.\n\nYou can't say that hey, there's 4 bad cops in this department that just did something bad which means all 1000 cops (random number) in this department are bad cops because they didn't turn them in before anything happened.  Well what the fuck do you want them to be turned in for?  Putting too much sugar in their coffee?\n\nYou don't know which cops are going to break the law and do something terrible until they've actually done it.  This isn't the fucking Minority Report, man.  We don't have some way of seeing what crimes cops will commit in the future and arrest them before they have the chance to do so.  You can't generalize every fucking cop and say they're all bad because they lack the magical ability to see the future.",

This mentality is not helpful! \n\nThis anger could be used to apply pressure to the actual problems, but people are too blind with a \"fuck da police\" mindset to make anything productive of this energy. Instead it blends with the anarchists saying \"get rid of the police we don't need them\" and creates a bigger devide while making the topic instantly controversial. It is such a shame. \n\nPicture the police institution like a bell pepper. You need to get the seeds of nasty corrupt shit out. Right now people are screaming to smash the bell pepper on the floor because everything associated with the seeds is bad and it doesn't matter because the good part of the pepper has been forced into sheltering those nasty seeds. Instead this energy could be used to cut the top off and pull put the nasty bit, and you would have a much better thing to eat. Maybe with a little cooking (reform) it would even be enjoyable. \n\nNow life is never that clear, but I still think it makes a point. Saying every cop is bad does not further the conversation. No one except deplorable people think police should kill people who are innocent -- they think deadly force should be the last option for dangerous people in most cases. But the sort of argument presented here refuses nuance. So the conversation gets stuck on \"not all cops are bad.\" And as long as the conversation is there, it might as well be dead. I don't understand why people can't lead with putting pressure on a specific issue (of which there are many) rather than this useless emotional appeal. Even if you truly are out to demonize every cop out here, living and dead, wouldn't you rather find a specific but obtainable change to lobby for that would still benefit the underlying cause behind your anger?\n\nWith the amount of shitty takes I see on reddit, I'm left to guess that the reason obtainable arguments are not made is because A. the poster knows little to nothing about how policing actually works and has just read a couple copy pastas designed to incit outrage (seriously I see so many people attributing random jobs to police that they have nothing to do with), or B. they knowingly appeal to outrage culture to get internet points, and care little about the actual issue. Not directed at OP here, just is just what I've seen from the general trends.\n\nThis shit is all top down. Starting with elected figures. Hold politicians accountable. Get rid of bad chiefs. Get rid of chiefs who shelter. Demand anonymous report options for those in the service, and follow up on these reports. Demand higher standards for psych evaluations. Ask police training to be more accessible for those who cannot afford to attend college classes (most academies have closed and been moved to privatized community College classes, limiting those who want to enter to the middle class). Additionally, require more classes about psychology, race relations, communication, etc. \n\nThese topics open conversation.",

So they need to stand by each other to survive. \n\nThe fact that cops don't turn in other cops is like a weird effect of corruption, it has happened for so long to protect the dirty, it is part of the fabric. Same with politicians, priests, etc. It is how the bad ones are allowed (and arguably wield more power than their honest counterparts???). \n\nHow do we break the cycle? Protest, get organised, support good cops, and ensure extreme, example making justice is served to every single person who abuses their power and the trust of the public. \n*Politicians simply 'resigning' when there is a scandal. NO! Firing, and a court appearance please. \n*Police getting suspended (paid or not) and then maybe let go. NO! They need to face trail! \n*Priests being 'dealt with' internally? NO!!! \n\nJustice is effort and sacrifice. What we are seeing more and more is selfishness and narsicism. We are making it too easy for people to slither off the hook!",

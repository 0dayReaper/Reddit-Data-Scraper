    "postText": "Bruce's music helped me the last few years throughout high school and other personal challenging moments in my life. Calling him my hero would be an understatement.\n\nI went to his show in Edinburgh a couple weeks ago and bloody loved it. Was only my second concert ever but it will forever be the best concert that I've ever seen. 73 years old and was on stage nonstop for nearly 3 hours!\n\nI also must admit I cried a little when he first came on stage and the entire place erupted. I will never forget that moment.",

Got to see Bruce in Orlando using Clarence's seats. The energy he puts forth every show is unreal. I'm disappointed I never got to meet him.",

My boss's business partner bought us tickets.\n\nI had given my parents tickets for the same show for Christmas because my mom is a huge fan, and my dad introduced her to Bruce. It ended up being the last show they saw together before my dad passed.\n\nI love Bruce so much, he's an amazing musician.",

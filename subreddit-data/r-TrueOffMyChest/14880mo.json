    "postText": "Just what the title says. I'm a late diagnosed autistic and it simply sucks. At the moment I can't get into therapy because it's too expensive and I only work half time.\n\nFeelings are very hard for me to understand, as well as what to say about them. For example, my gf said she was sad that a show she watched since highschool was over and it was important to her. My dumb, idiotic brain just thought \"why don't you watch it again then?\" and I said it to her as a sugestion. She then got so pissed at me thinking I was being selfish and not listening to her, when it wasn't my intention. It's SO hard for me to know what to say at these times, what am I supposed to say?? How am I supposed to help?? I wish I could help her and other people around me more and not be seem as cold, emotionless and selfish person. I care about other people a lot, I want to help, I can listen, but I just don't know what to say.\n\nI hope therapy can help me understand things more because if it doesn't then I'm sure I'll lose my gf and all of my friends like this.\n\n(This happened all my life tho, it's not a recent thing or anything ofc)",

            "comment": "It's okay, friend, you are not alone. Sometimes, there is more power in listening, rather than speaking. And sometimes, people just need someone to 'vent' to. I don't think you did anything wrong, at all, but maybe she was just feeling emotional, in the moment.\n\nNext time, you could try asking questions. Like, \"who was your favorite character?\" Or, \"what was the best episode?\" \"What moment was an oh, shit, moment in the show?\" \n\nEven though you are not making a statement, asking questions shows that you are interested. So try asking other questions next time, and it will hopefully demonstrate that you really want to engage with her.\n\nInstead of suggesting watching it again by herself, maybe suggest watching it again with her? You could do a little IMDB research and suggest that you watch a similar show together, too. My nephew is 17 and has autism. He is one of the coolest kids I know.\n\nChin up! You've got this!",

She asked for a break on the relationship after this and she barely wants to talk to me again, that was probably a bigger slip up for her than it seems. I feel a bit lost.\n\nThank you do much for the advice tho, cherish your nephew a lot please! This world isn't very kind to people like us.",

My wife is extremely understanding and makes a point to talk to communicate with me as much as possible.",

She asked for a break on the relationship after this and now we're separated. I feel bad but I'll keep going I guess.",

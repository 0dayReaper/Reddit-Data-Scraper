    "postText": "\nAs an American I believe that those who brags about the USA being the greatest country in the world are the ones who have never really seen the rest of the world. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love this country. But I\u2019m tired of patriotic Americans shouting constantly that we are the greatest nation on earth. We are not. I travel extensively for work and I think anyone else who has also seen the world will probably agree - we are quite far from being the greatest. This may be hard for some to swallow, but it\u2019s about time we realized this and started working on making America great again. Even though Trump shouts that line a lot, he\u2019s made America worse and we are now a global joke. Let\u2019s admit that our country needs work instead of being arrogant and proud. Don\u2019t be blinded by patriotism.\n\n\nEDIT: well this got a lot more attention than I thought it would. Some hateful comments as expected - I apologize if I ruined your morning. Please know that I love this country. And for those asking, where I would rather be, the answer is nowhere! Every time I fly back I\u2019m grateful to call the United States home. The point of this was not start debate about what the greatest country is. But for us Americans to realize that there is a lot wrong here and needs fixing. Americans are the loudest to shout \u201cgreatest country in the world!\u201d, but our country is slowing down and others are catching up. It\u2019s time we all realized that in my opinion. Stay safe everyone, and thank you for taking the time to read my post!",

                            "comment": "Hello Aussie friend. I want to explain two things about this unique American thing.  First the reason we get those ads are because pharmaceutical companies can be highly competitive here. Most countries have some sort of nationalized healthcare system that controls medical and drug costs and thus profits for the medical industry. We don't. America is the only place on earth where pharmaceutical companies and medical groups can basically make what they want. This is why all of our national discussions about medical care are actually discussions about medical costs. Its actually pretty brilliant marketing when you make millions of people confuse the quality of their care with the cost of their care.\n\nHow do they do this? You may have heard about our Food and Drug Administration on your news given the pandemic. This is the group that handles  regulations for a wide variety of industries related to the food and medical industries. What you have to really dig into to see is that the people inside this agency come and go as needed. One week a person who represents a  lobbyist group works for a group specifically charterd to schmooze congressional representatives to pass policy that benefits their industry. This is big money. The Congress passes a big sweeping bill and the next thing you know that lobbyist is all of a sudden a government employee in the FDA writing the actual regulations that execute that act of Congress they paid for. The lobbyist makes sure the law protects his representative companies from price fixing AND competition to open up new revenue streams. \n\nThe FDA does not protect the American people from bad things. It is the official government portal for these industries and protects these industries from competition and creates the illusion that FDA approval means safety. Chantix is just about the absolute worst evidence of this i have ever seen. Its a failed antidepressant that increased suicide rates in test groups. During testing they realized it encouraged smokers to stop smoking because it rewired the brain to make people physically sick when they smoked. The FDA allowed it to be rebranded as a smoking cessation aid even though it has a very poor performance for long term smoking cessation. Doctors know not to prescribe it to patients who display signs of depression etc. But, most smokers use cigarettes to self treat depression and stress so technically all smokers fall into that group. Its not safe, in fact this may be as dangerous as the legal opioid drugs, but its a safe market because if a bunch of smokers kill themselves who cares.\n\nMy nephew is a pharmacist. He hates his job. He makes buckets of money everyday but realized about 300k into it the industry has no interest in actually curing disease. The reality is drugs often don't meet FDA approval because they are effective. They would jeopardize medical industry jobs. I laugh when i see posts on reddit about fuck cancer, and how these new scientific studies might help us do this or that one day. If you knew we already had the potential to do so much of this people might really get mad, but they don't. Government is bae and they don't and never will know enough about the internal bureaucracy to understand how they are being fucked.\n\nThose ads are not just about sales. They are propaganda tools that help keep the public stupid. They help create the impression that drug companies are actually competing with each other, which should control prices, but they hide the fact the game was fixed from the start. This works two ways, it reinforces the capitalists belief we actually have capitalism, and it spurs the anticapitists to lobby and protest for more of what they are hiding. This way powerful corporations can enjoy the protection socialist systems provide while at the same time setting their own profit margins and pretending capitalism is to blame.\n\nThis is the reality of private public relationships.",

I'm old enough to remember when you didn't see ads for that stuff anywhere.  \n\nThe reason they were illegal is that in health care the idea of hypochondria is well documented.  Medicine recognizes that simple suggestion is enough to cause a percentage of people to literally get sick, and that medical decisions should be made by doctors and nurses, not by soap opera addicted housewives who have been programmed to buy a particular product.\n\nOriginally, mass media was forbidden from advertising health care because at least for medical products the government knew that some percentage of the people seeing those ads would literally get sick and a larger percentage would spend money on something that they didn't have to spend money on out of fear or fixation, endangering their health in the process.\n\nOne thing sorely lacking in US law is protections against using mass media for manipulation of viewers.  That's because political parties like the GOP need to use it, otherwise they'd never be elected.\n\nIf you're curious about any of this, look up the concept of \"subliminal advertising\" and learn about the furor around that and why it was banned years ago in the US, even though we later found out it doesn't work and the original claim was a fraud.\n\nBack then, people cared about being controlled by media.  Many of those people still alive today trust the media and don't realize it's changed.",

That's why there is a billion dollar industry around magic pills that you take and lose weight. \n\nOf course nobody reads the fine print on these pills that say \"A healthy diet and exercise in addition to taking these pills is required to lose weight.\" And nobody cares that these pills are unregulated and basically do nothing.",

However, I think we\u2019re near the top for being the best. First our poor are the richest of the poor around the world. (Living in a bad area of Chicago is a lot better then living in the bad area of Istanbul.) Our healthcare is some of the best in the world. I can guarantee that you don\u2019t want to to go to the doctor in Russia. I\u2019ve come back to the states from Switzerland to have surgery because the doctors there don\u2019t have the experience. Not to mention another doctor I consulted with in Austria advised me he would just amputate. Thirdly diversity. Our country is very diverse with many cultures. People seem to think racism is widespread in the USA. However, from my experiences and discussions with others racism is very prevalent and more outward across the world. If we were such a bad country why do we have people from around the world trying to get a visa?\n\nI could go on for days. OP\u2019s perceptive comes off  as an angry mid 20\u2019s entitled brat who thinks they can fix the world or any community. Reality he/she would show up to a remote village in Africa and kill the whole population off with his/her vision.\n\nEdit. Again this is from my perspective and experiences.

A lot of people (even our families) in the US, act like we are crazy or traitors. \n\nBut we have universal health care during this epidemic, legal pot, public transportation (we don't have to own cars anymore, so we sold ours and are saving a ton of money that way), and my kids costs for college are going to be so low (compared to anywhere in the US). Even with good health insurance in the US, a trip to the ER would cost over $500 (we know, my husband got a concussion once from wrestling with the kids), but here in Canada, we don't have to worry about it. My husband can work from home (he wasn't allowed to at his job in the US). I'm loving Canada-- I just wish it would warm up a bit!",

Coming from a third world country, watching those movies, US might even had been a different planet all together. \n\nI was fortunate to live in the US in my later life for few years and it was a very valuable experience but it was nowhere the fascination I had during my earlier days. Also, many of the things I got fascinated with got more prevalent in my own country and it tempered down what I was expecting from the US. It\u2019s still a great country but being let down by few in the top.",

I used to sit with the sports guys to file my articles and sometimes to interview people over the phone. The sports guys didn't understand an arts reporter... until I quietly mentioned that entertainment is one of our major exports. Then they understood.\n\nI lived overseas when 9/11 occurred. With no other Americans near me. My perspective of what happened after--the Iraq war, Afghanistan--was tempered by the fact that Bush, in the UK, was viewed as a knuckle-dragging lowbrow who was clueless. When I moved back to the States, I was amazed at the level of flag-waving and chest-beating \"'Murricans\" who had taken over.\n\nToday, we're just an international embarrassment.

We\u2019d never hurt a bunch of American girls!\u201d It was definitely terrifying haha I was like Jesus Christ thank god for white privilege in my case. \n\nWe were young and clueless though, may have been a bad area.

I get more annual leave here, way better pay not even considering the AUD which tanked. \n\nThe hardest part is leaving your friends but you get over that as you make close friends here and adjust to the lifestyle. Yes, you can find good coffee but no, brunch sucks and you can\u2019t find a good brunch to save your life anywhere in the states. \n\nBut overall, less stress in the US, more country to explore (lakes, hiking, climbing, kayaking etc) and just better place to live if you\u2019re not on minimum wage.",

There is no perfect place on earth imo. But, America is the only Western nation where I could have earned a PhD and be earning a six figure income rather than begging in the streets largely due to discrimination and the color of my skin. Trump isn't a good president but European leaders are nothing to write home about especially as a Rom as I could guarantee you in the US we wouldn't have elected or allow people who are part of literal terrorist organizations that kill minorities to be representatives in Congress unlike what currently goes on in Europe. \n\nIn my opinion, America is the greatest country in the world by default as I could not have achieved more or done better in any other place on earth. In America no one is excluded from achievement solely due to appearance or ethnicity, which is not true for most of the world. That does not mean America cannot become better only that America, for many, is in fact the greatest country in the world or more accurately the least bad of all options.",

You certainly don't know why, and no one ever explains it beyond other vague buzzwords: freedom, liberty, be whatever you want to be...\n\nI grew up in a private fundamentalist Christian school in the 1980's, so a lot of my programing was about how much better we are than the Soviets and how Communism means you can't have a Bible. Somehow ( whether expressed directly or inferred, I can't recall) we took that to mean than only America had such complete religious freedom, and Christianity was either outlawed or at very least discouraged everywhere else. That's why we had to send these missionaries all over the place. It seemed as much about spreading Americanism as Christianity. \n\nBut I don't want to give the impression that if you're not in that sort of an environment you miss out on the propaganda - which is not true at all. Just, that's what my experience was through age 12. After that I got the standard American propoganda experience: \"American Dream\" \"Be anything/anyone you want\", \"people come from all over the world because success can only be found within our borders. How lucky are you to already live here?!\". The overriding theme of all of it though is \"all hail capitalism\" and how such messaging shapes your view of what success is, or whay it means to be a great country. When it comes down to it, the message is that the US is great because of our military, and our economy. And your life is good and meaningful if you get rich and powerful too. If not...if you end up poor or lower middle class, then it's not just that you failed, YOU ARE a failure. There is only one way to be here. Only one value system, and try as hard as you like to break away from thay mind set, but good luck because they've been programming you with it since they sat you down in front of your first Saturday morning cartoon. Get rich, or feel bad. \n\nI don't know, maybe it's just me, but that doesn't feel like freedom.",

Its a land full of art (music, books, painting, sports, cinema, etc.), freedom, beauty, dreams and so much more.\n\nIts a country with so much potential and that has nothing to do with its history or achievements or whatever, its about the mountains, the forests, the animals, in one word: the lots of biomes you can find there.\n\nAll those things I talked about in this firsts two paragraphs is what makes USA so amazing and I personally would definitely LOVE that the United States of America would become a country that helps others to grow and heal of the wounds that history have left behind and that welcomes anyone to enjoy its beauty and all the good things it has to offer.\n\nI'm glad to tell you that my own country is not great at all. Yes, we have free education; yes, we offer free medical attention; yes, we help other countrys; but Cuba is no where near of being perfect. First of all, as an student I can say that school here is a SHIT, there're lots of good things about the cuban education but there are also lots of horrible stuff. We care way more about getting good marks than we do about studying and learning new things; we don't care about Revolution, we just wanna LIVE OUR LIFES; they say we students are the future, haha, yeah, they want us to continue with the same ol' crap the generation of Fidel started (do you know what I mean?). Maybe Im talking for myself but Im sure Im not wrong.\n\nI'm not an anti-revolutionary but I would want my country to stop bragging so much about REVOLUTION and just do what is right and necessary for us to grow as a nation but sadly, I think my country is too damn drowned in its own history to know how to do that.\n\nAt last, I know what you mean, 'cause I have the same opinion about my country.\n\nI feel you bro ;P (kidding).\n\nPS: I would give you the BEST AWARD but I dont have coins.",

It's the southern states that pretend that that's cold, but that's because they're used to it being like 80\u00b0 (which is about 25\u00b0 or so for you).  I'd probably be wearing shorts at that temperature.\n\nYour better comparison would have been 32\u00b0 which is literally freezing for us, but fairly hot for you.  \n\nThe conversion math really isn't that difficult to rough out. \u00b0F to \u00b0C you take away 32\u00b0 and then take a little less than half from the result, \u00b0C to \u00b0F you add 32 then add a little more than half the the result. It's not scientifically accurate, but it's good enough to give you a rough idea.",

But I\u2019m surrounded by racist idiots. This country is 90% shit to anyone with Asian heritage. We try so hard to live our lives with respect and dignity, to raise our children and contribute to our society. But the society is hateful, ignorant, selfish, racist. If it\u2019s not hating people from one continent, it\u2019s hating people from another. We are antagonistic towards every country that does not bend to our will. We are antagonistic to the people living in countries that do bend to our will.\n\nAnd now in time of coronavirus, it is plainly clear that we will screw each other, all doing everything we can to not get screwed. Sheesh... the toilet paper fiasco is evidence how disgusting a people we are.\n\nAnd we take all the gross disgusting problems within America in stride. People lying in the street all over the country? That\u2019s freedom. People going bankrupt over medical care?  Can\u2019t pay, can\u2019t play. Massive education debt? Get a job. Wealth gap?

    "postText": "So for context my boyfriendused to have anorexia when he was teenager for a few years and recovered when he came to uni. He gained weight during lockdown and started struggling again with his self esteem about the way he looks. Then his relationship at the time started turning sour and became emotionally abusive and he left and and quickly after met me. The break up and the stuff that happened beforehand triggered him to spiral back into his old habits but he seemed to be doing better now he was in a happier and healthy situation which lead to him gaining weight. Recently he\u2019s been really harsh on his own body and scrutinising the way he looks in pictures etc. \n\nHe\u2019s started saying he isn\u2019t hungry around meal time and only having small portions. He keeps reading to calories on packages and suddenly became infatuated with getting back to working out again. He\u2019s stopped eating lunch when he\u2019s at work and constantly says he feels bad about what he\u2019s just ate etc. I know he doesn\u2019t eat food when I\u2019m not around him and I try my best to encourage him to have some food but he just claims he isn\u2019t hungry. I\u2019m worried this might be the start of it again and I don\u2019t know what to do. I think he is the most beautiful person I have ever met and I wouldn\u2019t change a single thing about him but I just don\u2019t know how to help. \n\nI haven\u2019t had any experience with eating disorders of know anyone before with one and I don\u2019t know what to say to him to encourage him and help him. I\u2019m trying to help him go to therapy and encouraging him to lose weight in a healthy way with the correct foods and exercise (we both have quite poor diets and aren\u2019t very active people) but I feel like I need to do more. Any advice ?",

            "comment": "I was bulimic for around 10 years. I had got down to around 100 pounds. I'm 5'11 and male so it was really dangerous and I'm surprised my heart didn't stop. One thing that always angered me was when someone mentioned if I had a problem. My mother especially. Mainly because she would tell everyone she talked to who would ask about me. It started to be embarrassing when it seemed like everyone knew about it. I was in a relationship that turned out to be a very bad experience and my heart was broken in a way that I can't even describe. Idk it was like I started to not really care about what I looked like anymore and the bulimia just stopped. Recently though I've gained so much weight and it's been getting to me. I haven't been bulimic for over a year now. One thing I suggest for you is to not mention anything about a problem to him. I feel like it's a triggering thing and also a rebellion thing when someone confronts you about it. I know it makes it difficult but just try to feed him everytime you're around him. If he wants smaller portions than let him because I think right now it lets him feel safe. And it's better for him to eat something instead of nothing. If things get worse I would suggest talking to his family and maybe get him some professional help but make that a last resort because he could isolate himself away from you and everyone if he feels threatened.",

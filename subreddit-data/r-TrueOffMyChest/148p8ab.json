    "postText": "**NSFW/Trigger Warning SA** \n\nI purchased concert tickets on resale for an artist on my bucket list in February. This artist stopped touring for several years and then announced a tour out of nowhere.\n\nOnce I secured the tickets, I invited my boyfriend who was more than excited to come along. I told him to book the date off work and I would organise everything else.\n\nThe concert is Saturday. My boyfriend decided to tell me yesterday that he never booked the concert off work and is now unable to get it off.\n\nI was more than upset and felt really disappointed with my boyfriend. We spoke so much about going to this concert and listened to the artist together in anticipation.\n\nAs the tickets were resale, I couldn\u2019t resell them on the website or any ticket sales websites. I thought the tickets couldn\u2019t be sold and told my boyfriend I was going to be out of pocket because going alone to this concert was not an option. My boyfriend said he felt bad but didn\u2019t seem to really care at the same time. \n\nMy friend showed me how to transfer the tickets and I sold them for below face value, but I didn\u2019t tell my boyfriend I sold them and continued to complain about how upset and dissapointed I was. He then sent me the full amount I paid for the tickets to \u201cstop my whinging\u201d and I have decided to keep his money as compensation, and intend to buy myself something nice this weekend.\n\nEdit: A LOT of you are asking why I can\u2019t go alone and to briefly explain as I did in the comments, I was SA\u2019d at an outdoor music festival when I was 17. I ended up in hospital hours away from home and never felt more afraid. Even though now in my twenties, going alone would cause my parents a high level of anxiety and they probably wouldn\u2019t sleep until they seen me safe and well in person. I attended counselling on and off over the past five years and learned coping mechanisms, but I developed an anxiety toward big social events particularly music festivals or concerts. It was only five years later (this January) where I felt \u201csafe\u201d enough to go to a concert again and my boyfriend came with me. Going alone isn\u2019t an option for what I hope you now know are obvious reasons. I also asked friends and family if they were available to come but none of them were. Selling the tickets was my last option. The reason I complain so much is because I had my hopes built up and let down.",

                    "comment": "The concert\u2019s a gruelling six hour journey away by public transport and split into two bus journeys. On Saturday, the bus schedule is reduced and runs less frequently due to weekend hours and there\u2019s a 3 hour layover between the buses meaning it would take a total of 9 hours to get there. With the way the bus schedules are, I would either get there right on time or halfway through the concert (if there was delays which there typically is). \n\nSo, you could essentially say I would be travelling from England to Scotland (where the concert is, is technically another country and one that is completely unknown to me).\n\nWithout disclosing too much, I was SA\u2019d at a big outdoor music festival when I was 17. I was hours away from home and ended up in hospital in another city. I have never gone to a live music event alone, especially a festival, in the month of June since. It was only January of this year that I went to my first live music event (five years on from the incident) with my boyfriend.  I have attended psychotherapy with an SA crisis centre and learned coping mechanisms, and I will one day get to a place where I can go to these events without fear. Unfortunayely going to a concert so far away from home is not an option due to past experiences.",

My friend has a child and unfortunately can\u2019t organise childcare at such short notice or also get the time off work. My boyfriend stated when he mentioned feeling bad that he \u201cshould\u2019ve just let me gone with friend\u201d and also wouldn\u2019t be completely comfortable if I went alone.

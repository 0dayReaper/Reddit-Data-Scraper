    "postText": "Being below average in height is something that I have to deal with every single day of my life. It doesn\u2019t matter where I go or what I do, someone always finds a way to remind me of how short I am, whether it\u2019s in school, outside, or even among my friends who joke about it. It\u2019s not like I have a medical condition that causes me to be short, but sometimes it feels like I do.\n\nBeing short affects me in so many ways that I wish it didn\u2019t. For one thing, I\u2019m never taken seriously by anyone, even by the authorities. One time, I had to talk to the police about something and they actually used a high pitched voice when they first spoke to me. How disrespectful is that? And when it comes to dating, I have a hard time finding someone who likes me for who I am and not for how tall I am. I\u2019ve been rejected by many people because of my height, even though I work out almost every day, take care of my hair and try to look my best.\n\nI don\u2019t blame them though. If I were a girl, I probably wouldn\u2019t date a shorter guy either. That\u2019s just the way it is. The society we live in favors tall people over short people, especially men. At my campus, I\u2019m one of the shortest students there, and most people laugh at me when I\u2019m just doing my own thing.\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019m asking for too much. I\u2019m not even that much below the average height. I\u2019m only 4cm shorter than the average guy. But that 4cm makes a huge difference in how people treat me and how I feel about myself. It doesn\u2019t help that I skipped a grade, so everyone in my class is one year older and taller than me.\n\nBut you know what? There\u2019s nothing I can do to change my height. It\u2019s something that I was born with and that I have to accept. No matter how much I wish or hope or pray, I can\u2019t make myself grow taller. There are no magic pills or potions or surgeries that can make me taller. There are no exercises or diets or stretches that can make me taller. There are no clothes or shoes or accessories that can make me taller. There are no tricks or hacks or secrets that can make me taller. My height is fixed and unchangeable and that\u2019s the harsh reality that I have to face every day.",

I believe finding someone who respects you for who you are is more important than height. I do not have a strong preference for dogs, but I do appreciate animals. Perhaps I will encounter my ideal partner at a social event or a cultural venue.\ud83d\ude0a",

It\u2019s easy to say that I should find someone who will love me for me, but it\u2019s not nearly as easy to do.\n\nWomen have preferences, standards and expectations and I mostly don\u2019t meet them. I\u2019m always overlooked, rejected and ignored because of my height. It\u2019s frustrating and depressing. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but it\u2019s not something that I can just brush off.",

I\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019ve struggled with feeling unattractive and that it impacted your self-image. I know how hard it can be to deal with low self-esteem and insecurity. You seem like a very kind and genuine person who values people\u2019s inner qualities and not their outer appearance. That\u2019s amazing and admirable. I hope you realize that your appearance doesn\u2019t define you or your worth. You, and a lot of people have so much more to offer than your looks. People like this deserve to be happy and loved for themselves.",

I know that some people may judge us based on our height or use us as an example of how society is unfair to short men. But I also think that being short has its advantages and that we should not let others define our worth or happiness. According to an article by Mara Altman in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/01/opinion/height-short.html), short people live longer, have a lower incidence of cancer, are more environmentally friendly, and have more diverse romantic options than tall people.\n\nShe also argues that being short is the future, as more people around the world are becoming shorter due to better nutrition and health care. So I don\u2019t think we should feel bad about being short or let misogynists and incels make us feel inferior. We have plenty of reasons to be proud of our height and ourselves.\ud83d\udc4d",

I have had people laugh, not take me seriously, all that jazz. But one thing I never did was let that stop me from doing anything. People will always be jerks, and you will always encounter those people, but from my experience that\u2019s the minority of people and I just ignore them. At my age, if someone takes the time to make fun of me I just look at them like they\u2019re stupid, they usually get the hint and realize they\u2019re being dumb. \n\nAs for women, maybe I\u2019m lucky I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve always respected their preferences but again, I never let it stop me. I\u2019ve had women taller than me be interested in me just because I\u2019ve been a fun person to be around. Even women who have been 6+ ft. People like fun people. If you can laugh at yourself at times it really does help.  \n\nAs for the benefits of being small, man I can go on and on. I don\u2019t have to fight people for certain clothes sizes or shoe sizes, planes are a breeze to fly on. Beds have so much more room. I don\u2019t hit my head on things as nearly as much as tall people. We tend to live longer too. There are just so many small and big benefits in my opinion of being small. \n\nIt just sucks now because young people are dumb as shit and don\u2019t have a filter and will say just about anything. At my age people usually just don\u2019t give a shit. Hope things get better for you my guy. Just think about those benefits though!",

    "postText": "So, I just took a walk at 4 am, on a warm day, about a week away from summer. The fact that I not only wasn't happy, but that I just stared at the floor, completely spaced out, concerns me. I was ruminating about my life and my lack of clear directions. I've been like this for nearly a year, now, with ups and downs. Last year, I dropped out of school, to work, since I knew I would have to work at least 5 months, in order to buy everything I needed (and wanted), which would prevent me from going back to school in September. I still need to complete another grade, before having my diploma.\n\n Anyway, this is not my main problem. My main problem is that there's only two ways I could realistically achieve happiness (at least for now) and these two are mutually exclusive and REQUIRED in order for me to be happy. For as long as I can remember, joining the military has been my only aspiration in life. Two years ago, I lost 60 lbs in about three months, with one of my two motivations being to be fit for service. The other reason popped up, about two months before that: I started showing symptoms of gender dysphoria and I still fill disgusted about myself, everytime I remember that i'm a man. I'm still masc presenting and I use he/him pronouns, but i'm diagnosed and in the process of medically transitioning. For the last two years, i've been procrastinating on finding a solution and i've been pursuing both goals at the same time...\n\nExcept I can't do this anymore, i'm at the boiling point where I HAVE to make a choice, at the risk of losing both. I'm getting estrogen in a week and in about a month, i'm going to do an aptitude test to join the military. I have to make a choice, because while trans people are accepted in the canadian military, the loss of physical strength and endurance, as well as the potential shunning makes these two mutually exclusive, in my mind.\n\nThis is not even the worse part, however. You see, both of these choices have massive downsides. If I take the \"Join the military\" path, i'll suffer from gender dysphoria, which will gradually worsen as I become more \"manly\". There's also the issue of my motivation, which is very random, at time. Last week, I ran at least 5 kilometers, as well as doing a timed 1 mile run, everyday. This week, I struggle to get out of my house to go run, every two days. I'm constantly one bad day away from losing every bit of motivation and being depressed and self conscious for a week. If I choose the \"Take hormones\" part, i'm going to prevent my childhood dream from happening. I'm also going to have to obtain my diploma, then pursue further education, in something related to my only other passion: music. Sadly, I have 6 months of experience with any instrument (in my case, guitar), so i'm not even qualified to apply in anything related to music (I think so, at least.)\n\nAnyway, I doubt a single person will even read all of this, but if i'm wrong, here's a conclusion, I guess.\n\nI never thought my first year of adulthood would be spent as a drop out stoner dirtbag, stuck between a rock and a hard place, unable to make a decision....",

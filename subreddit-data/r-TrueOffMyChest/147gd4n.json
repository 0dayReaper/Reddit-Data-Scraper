    "postText": "I'm 20 years old. I live with my mom, my younger sister, and my grandmother. There is never a day that goes by where the house isn't constantly filled with noise.\n\nMy sister suffers from anger issues and is constantly pushing my mother's buttons to get them to fight. My mother also goes to her boyfriend's house all the time and that causes my grandmother and mom to fight. Then they all complain to or yell at me, depending on who it is and what the problem is. I need to move out.\n\nThere's issues with that. I only work part time at the moment, and I can't drive myself anywhere. I don't have a car, either, so even if I could, I don't have a way to. \n\nI fantasize about moving out and limiting contact with my family, and I fantasize about how much happier I'd be if I did. I feel like an asshole for ibecauset,  I know they're all struggling. Does it make me an asshole to want to do that?",

    "postText": "\nThis has happened ever since I was real little. I have anxiety and I\u2019m overall a very anxious overthinking person. Sometimes (I\u2019d say between once a week and once a month) I\u2019ll wake up and instantly I think \u201cone day I\u2019m gonna die and I can\u2019t do anything to prevent it. One day I\u2019m gonna have to lay on my death bed and know I\u2019m fading away\u201d. It\u2019s not a panic attack but it shocks me and feels like a mini panic attack, it\u2019s really weird to explain. I\u2019ve always wondered why this happens. It\u2019s not a fun way to wake up at all and death has always scared me. Why does this happen?",

    "postText": "I'm a 22 year old male, and my dad at the age of 70 thinks told me that his gut instinct was warning him he's about to die. He just got out of the hospital less than 24 hours ago after he went in for rapid shallow breathing, erratic heartbeats, and really bad sweating. He went in after he tried to stand up, and the first two symptoms happened. The doctors couldn't figure out why his body was doing that, so he left after multiple test. I'm scared he might be gone soon, and I don't know how I'm gonna take it or how I'm gonna process it for month on end. For anyone who has lost a parent as a young adult or teenager. How did you process with it and looked forward... I'm lost",

She just fainted and didn\u2019t wake up. No clue what happened either but she had alot of health issues before hand. It was just so unexpected because she had worked so hard on losing weight and improving her health, literally best health when she passed in comparison to the last 15 year. We were best friends and I miss her every day and I can say I\u2019m at peace knowing we were in good terms, we had an amazing relationship, and we knew how much we loved eachother. If I had known it was going to happen, I think I would have just wanted to talk with her. Hear old stories one last time, make a recording of her voice because I miss it so much, and make sure she knew it was okay and that I would be okay. Don\u2019t squander this opportunity to enjoy these last moments, no matter how bitter sweet",

    "postText": "*WARNING* sexual assault, mental, sexual, physical and emotional abuse.\n\n(yes I understand now that all the situations I was in horrible and honestly feels like my fault but currently in therapy to help my ptsd from everything and reassurance that this wasn\u2019t my fault)\n\nLet me start with background I (24F) and im pansexual (this is important later)grew up with no mother and no father but was taken in by my great grandmother once I was 6 months old since my parents had refused to take care of me leaving me in a crib not changing my diaper or even feeding me most times. They even left me at home to go party and do drugs. I was lucky to survive somehow. My great grandmother always called me her miracle child. Yet I was always jealous of other children for having their parents and always felt unwanted. I got bullied for it and for my dyslexia, I even had even gotten beaten up for it. When i started High school I (was 14 at this time) was in band and met a guy J (18) at first he was amazing, loving, and kind. But that quickly took a turn after i had gotten an injury (we both were in tennis) and he suggested we go practice so I could work my arm back up. But it went really bad, I ended up getting drugged to the bathroom and ended up being r-word. I tried telling my school administrators but it was literally pushed under the rug since he was in rotc and one of the top people in there. After that it stared a long line of abuse and I grew to believe it was normal. The next year I met a girl ((Ann 14F) she will be important later also), man I fell for her quickly, but that turned to years of mental abuse. I would take care of her as she would come to school bc she would cut herself and i would clean her up and bandage her id call her my princess, bring her presents. She had always told me she loved me then turn around and cheat on me with J  then come back to me or even after we fully separated she tell me how much she loved me then turn around again and blame me for stuff that happened to her. Between her and J, there was a point I just broke and had cut myself up. About a year later I met Thomas (16m) \nand it took a bit to get him to talk to me as at this point J left rumors that I was a slut and only my friends believed me on what happened. Well Thomas learned the truth and started talking to me we eventually got together but after being with me for a bit and learned of my bad habits from my ex (which was doing what i was told no matter how much i dont want to and i basically learned to be a slave) he also learned about my blackouts during sex, my extreme anxiety and depression, took that to his advantage and did as he wanted to me this lasted for about 3 years. During that time i had gotten an ESA for my anxiety attacks and I eventually got away from that relationship after a suicide attempt. But after that break up i was constantly told that no one would want me because of my blackouts during sex, that id be a shitty mom one day and that no one wants something thats used. My ex Ann also was coming and going again but told me that it was my fault she got r-word. ( i had already graduated at this point so i don\u2019t understand how) I got to a point that i ran from home because i just couldn\u2019t anymore, but just ended up in another situation (2019) where i (19 at the time) met a guy (25m) Kai. I was living with him for about 2 months but within that time i was locked in the house my car keys were taken i was told to sleep in the corner, I was thrown when i refused sex or even a kiss he was beating my ESA and he ended up getting rid of her bc he didnt like her, ( my heart tore into thousands of pieces after this happened) and searched for her for weeks once i got ahold of my keys but no luck. He even let his bestfriend use me and had my strip for him and his friends. It got to the point he broke my phone and I couldn\u2019t get ahold of people. But a friend of mine called 911 since I hadn\u2019t answered in days. The cops ignored the abuse since Kai worked at the county jail. And and was told to leave. Yet he took my keys and wouldn\u2019t let me leave till i snuck out the next morning.",

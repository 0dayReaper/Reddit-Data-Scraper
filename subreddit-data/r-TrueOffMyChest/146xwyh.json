    "postText": "I met my boyfriend after only ever being cheated on by exes, with the most recent one before him being the worst offender of the bunch. I had no self esteem and massive trust issues and insecurities. I had removed myself from the dating pool to just try to enjoy being single and find myself but I met him naturally and our connection was so strong and undeniable that I couldn\u2019t just say no to it. \n\nI\u2019ll spare the details but in the past year he\u2019s been so amazing and loving and trustworthy. But my issues were so bad. I was so transparent with him in the beginning and I laid out that this was going to be hard for me no matter how great he was. And he agreed and promised up and down he\u2019d do anything. But it gets exhausting to be with an insecure person. \n\nFor the record I\u2019ve never accused him of cheating without grounds or something like that. I would just ask for reassurance a lot. Or get really worked up over small things he messed up on because to me they felt big. Or just randomly constantly worry he was going to leave me, or that normal things meant he didn\u2019t love me. I get it. It\u2019s exhausting whether I mentally prepared him for it in the beginning or not. \n\nI snapped out of it a few weeks ago after a conversation. I\u2019ve been really different. Things got really hard as we moved in together about a month and a half ago to a totally new place after being long distance which brought about new insecurities and fears. But I chose to be different and we\u2019ve been happy. We haven\u2019t really argued in weeks, we\u2019ve both seemingly been enjoying life a lot more. He\u2019s been much more happy and loving too. \n\nBut last night now he told me he\u2019s stuck in the negative mindset of never knowing if we\u2019re about to fight and that he\u2019s accustomed to being in a problematic relationship. It fucking sucks. I know I was in the wrong and I\u2019m not here to be criticized I just want to tell into the void about how unfair it is that someone else messed me up and on the road to healing I\u2019ve hurt my boyfriend now. \n\nHe\u2019s not leaving or anything and we\u2019ll get through this together I just feel awful because I love him so much. All I can do is continue to be better and self soothe and show him that things are different and I will stop letting my insecurities get the best of me.",

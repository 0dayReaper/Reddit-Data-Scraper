    "postText": "The title of the post, I mean that wholeheartedly. As I'm on break for school, it hasn't even been a month in, and I'm done with my mother. Well, more like my mother being controlled by her husband. Before she got married, she was very independent, opinionated, stubborn, and would go to bat for any of her kids, any day. After getting married, she has become a different person over the last two years after getting married. \n\n\nShe doesn't stand up for herself when he treats her horribly, she can never go out on her own for longer than an hour, she never spends time with any of her children, and can't be by herself doing what she wants, unless he is working. He expects her to do everything for him, his laundry, clean their space, clean the dishes, while having a labor intensive job. He treats her like he treats his own mother, and he doesn't even have a job himself. These are just some of the things I have watched happen over the last two years. She can't parent her own children, or do anything for them, without getting in trouble for it.\n\n\nAnyone that has been around for at least a year in my life, has seen the same things I have. I don't like what he has done to my mother, she's become someone that just does chores for him. That doesn't get her own life, outside of him. He controls every single thing she does, and no matter what I say, she won't leave. I don't think they even married for actual love, even though his sister says he was looking for rings. They were some pretty hefty court stuff, and married so they wouldn't testify against each other. But people say he planned on proposing before anything happened in the first place.\n\n\n I wish she never got married to him in the first place. She used to be such a different person, and now, it feels like I'm just a burden for her to deal with, because of him. He talks so much crap on her kids, and she would never have listened to a word of it. He calls all of us ungrateful, lazy, and children that don't know how to act like adults. He's never interacted with any of us for longer than 45 minutes. He would know that we've had to work ourselves to the bone because of how poor we were. He doesn't understand that we know how to adult, because we were forced to. He tries to ride my ass about how I do nothing all day, and that I should be lined up with chores everyday so that I can't have the time to just sit. He doesn't know that I have a job, I have a social life, I have hobbies, and that's more than what he has.\n\n\nHe is the most toxic, frustrating, and pathetic person I've met. He doesn't have a job, he just mows a lawn, wastes his money on half-assed attempts at quick money, and works on his toys, as well as a bike that just sits in our garage. He avoids his own family like the plague, and then expects others to do what he says. I wish my mother would see what a controlling person he is, and makes it a point to criticize others, when he barely does anything he's criticizing others on. I can't wait to leave and be on my own, away from that man, and away from the person that has replaced the woman my mother used to be. Maybe she'll realize it on her own, when she doesn't have a kid around at the very least. Time will fly at that point. Hopefully, anyway.",

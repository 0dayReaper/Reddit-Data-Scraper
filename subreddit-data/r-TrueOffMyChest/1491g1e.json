    "postText": "Sorry if this post is a little hard to understand but english isn't my first language.\n\nWhen he was in middle school my boyfriend dated a girl. She was extremely unstable and had severe mental issues, her family was also very abusive and she didn't really have any friends so he became his whole support system. This relationship lasted until highschool when they broke up since they were going to different schools.\n\nMy boyfriend and I met and started dating when we were in college and he told me about this person and how he really whised he could've done more for her. A few months into our relationship they happened to meet at a party and started talking again. I didn't see an issue with this at first an actually encouraged their friendship since she seemed to be doing better.\n\nThis only lasted a couple of months and then she started to demand his attention all the time, telling him that she was feeling suicidal and how she needed him to always be on call, it got to the point where all he would talk about was her and her mental issues, he was skipping class to go an comfort her and started to fail his classes. I confronted him about how this wasn't healthy to him and how he needed to get out of that toxic friendship so he decided to cut her off.\n\nThings seemed to be going fine until the lockdown. Due to his workplace closing he had to put school on hold, she found out about this and offered him a job at her family's business. He accepted and started working for her family, she would constantly visit him at work and they resumed their friendship.\n\nAfter some time working together her family offered to pay for his school tuition if he moved closer to them. He accepted and moved in to a house they would rent him. A couple of days after moving in everyone lost contact with him. His friends, his family and I all tried to contact him but we got no response, we even tried going to the house he was renting but it was empty.\n\nA couple of weeks later he contacted us from a friends house. Turns out that his ex's family had decided that they didn't want to take care of her anymore and wanted him to be her caretaker 24/7 so they kidnapped him.\n\nAfter that we had to spend weeks talking to the police who did nothing but victim blame him and discourage us from pressing charges. \n\nHe's been dealing with PTSD ever since and it got so bad that we had to leave the state since he was unable to go out because of how scared he was of her family finding him and taking him away. \n\nDue to the moving I've also had to put my studies on hold until I'm able to transfer to the college here, not only that but I'll also be set back two whole semesters since the school's curriculum and my old school's curriculum don't match.\n\nWhile we're dealing with all of this her and her family get to walk around like nothing happened. They often post on social media about their expensive vacations and their successful business and the police refuse to do anything about it since they're close with politicians in my state.\n\nI'm tired of having to deal with all this and I genuinely wish nothing but the worse for her and her family.",

            "comment": "Sounds like your boyfriend ruined your life together by putting his ex above your relationship. \n\nThis is not about her, its about him. He chose to get dragged into a caretaker situation for someone who clearly needs professional help and a psych evaluation under observation for more than a few weeks. \n\nInstead of handing this off to the authorities, and bowing out - he kept trying to 'handle it'. \n\nIt's not his to handle. He needs to let this go, and cut himself off. Instead, he chose to stay, or do, or help...\n\nThis is clearly a case where professional services are needed. It's above anyone's pay grade - it's past the point of family, friends, or past intimate connections trying to fix it. \n\nShe needs real help. He's doing more damage by trying to play therapist, friend, and ex. \n\nIt's on him, not her. He should have stepped out, stepped aside, and made the hard call to remove himself from her life. \n\nNot just because you are in a relationship - because when anyone's mental health problems are affecting the day to day lives of their support network they need to seek professional help. \n\nYour partner needs to cut ties, and let it go. He's choosing instead get sucked in to her crisis, that's not healthy.",

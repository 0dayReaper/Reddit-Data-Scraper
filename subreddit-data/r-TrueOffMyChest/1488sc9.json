They are my pride and joy. Since they are why do I still want to kill myself? Am I a defective person? What\u2019s wrong with me? I should be the happiest person rn and I feel like it at times but most of the time I\u2019m depressed and very suicidal. There\u2019s been times where I think it\u2019s better for them that I perished from this earth and not let them suffer from my condition. I love them more than the universes ever growing body. But I still can\u2019t shake off the bad side of my brain. Am I broken?",

I lived on my own then one day I hated everything for no reason. Most of the time it\u2019s just an over powerful feeling of just being mentally drained. My main suggest is therapy it\u2019s scary at first but they help so much and give you such an insight to why you are feeling this way. If you don\u2019t want to do because you think you can push through to them do it for your little girl so you can be there for her when she needs it most so you can be there to watch her grow up and go to prom, college, walk her down the aisle when she gets married. It\u2019s difficult to push through but it\u2019s possible. Also never be ashamed of having mental struggles/hiccups they happen to everyone weather they admit it or not they happen and it just helps us better understand what\u2019s going around us. \n\n\nSorry if that made no sense and just looks like a word vomit.",

The best way i can say this is to quote Simpsons and say do it for her. Do it to see your daughters first school dance. Do it to see her graduate. Do it to walk her down the aisle. Do it see your grandkids. Make depression fight for every inch, if its gonna kill you, then it doesn't get to make you do it.",

Everyone struggles with mental health at some point, no one is invincible to the burdens of pain that come with this world. It takes great strength to admit that you need support and you know what? Even the strongest of them all needs support. No one is designed to face everything alone, if we were.. if we all individually had the answers to everything, life would be pointless. That is one of the beautiful things about the world that we live in, we all go through and experience life differently. That also means that we all have valuable tools and wisdom to share. Sometimes we need to swallow that pride and fear and allow someone to share with us a tool or words of wisdom necessary for helping shift us into a new perspective. It is ok to not be ok. The real test is learning to allow that moment in time to be what it is \u201c a moment in time\u201d. I promise everything will be ok, just let the people who can and will help you, in.",

And this may even be a symptom of something deeper rather than the just being the cause itself.\n\nYour situation sounds like something I relate to very closely. The meds I've used have helped up to a point, the talk-based therapy never really got anywhere",

    "postText": "I'm really a calm person, I just suffer from a bit of persistent depressive disorder but nothing great. My dreams in general tend to be a bit strange and I usually remember them with preciousness.\n\nTonight I made my dinner, brushed my teeth and slept like I usually do on a regular basis. I woke up and went to school like I was used to, the strange thing I noticed was that everyone was acting like I had intended in the past that an average person would act. The boys playing soccer and the girls talking to each other, I am a person who is not characterized by either of the two, not because I am non-binary, but because I simply cannot fit in with either of the two, so since I do it frequently, I get together with my friends.\n\nEverything was going smoothly, except that I felt more rested compared to before and lighter. Nothing really changed on the first day, but leaving there, my ex-girlfriend, whom I'll call Ruth, suggested that I go to her house, apparently I was dating her, but it wasn't a lucid dream so I couldn't interrupt. to question it.\n\nI just went with her and started doing what we used to do before, playing video games, playing with her cats, and spending time with my mother-in-law. Then the night came and my in-laws, she and I sat at the table and started to eat, really everything was peace and quiet, I even did something that I always wanted to do but never did because of my shyness and that was to sleep with her, not in sexual theme, but feeling the warmth of someone being something I wanted to do for a long time.\n\nFor a second day, I was going to school as usual until the surprise came that Ruth changed to my same course, my course is psychology, and she was interested for a moment but in the end she gave up. decided by law. She helped me to make everyone in my class my friends and to be happier with them, it was the first time I made a male friend, and it felt strange to recognize me too much with someone, everything was still perfect.\r  \nAt night, more of the same, only this time I went home and my parents weren't fighting like usual, and I finally had dinner with them, instead of hiding in my room for dinner.\n\nOn the third day, perhaps the most impressive thing that ever happened to me happened. They had called me from an important company to do a job interview, since they saw my various achievements and wanted to see if they could hire me, I know that it doesn't work that way in real life, but at that moment I was excited by the great offer of job that I had at that time, after that I went to the offices of that place where they had called me after school, they reviewed my papers and they saved me a very well paid position. My girlfriend was at least happy that I had been hired in a company as big as the one that had called me, and we had a party to celebrate it with my new friends, my girlfriend's family and mine, everything was still happiness.\n\nThe fourth day, later school. I went to the new job that I had been hired for. I was nervous but my girlfriend accompanied me to the company so that I would not be so anxious, since I also suffer from it, everyone received me with a warm welcome, having a party the boss personally approaches me and told me that since I was little, my successes had impressed him and he was at least enthusiastic to start working with me. After the party, we all started working on what we had to do. It was an important presentation to the shareholders of the company and we had to explain the good investments we would make if they invested in our company. I am really a person who knows how to narrate what he is saying very well, so I decided that I would be the one to explain the main and important thing, after that presentation everyone applauded me and we continued working for what would be the future of the same company, later I arrived at my girlfriend's house where we had the same dinner, and this time my in-laws were proud to have a son-in-law as talented as me. Everything was still happiness, too much to be real.\n\nThe fifth day, a teacher at the school called me and went to look for me to ask me if I wanted to play for an event they were having, since I know how to play the violin. I said I accepted, so he took me to the audiovisual of the school where there was a violin and where the song was one that I knew perfectly, there were two songs that would be played at the event, one with all the members and the other Only the violinist and the pianist, the song that everyone would play would be ''Spectacular spiderman'' since I would play the electric guitar, which I also know how to play. And for the second song it would be ''Final Duet'' from Omori's game, something that seemed strange to me but that tasted perfect. After practicing for a while I went to work where we only accommodated what we had collected from the future actions that we would do in the company. I was really looking forward to the event that would be in a couple of days. At home, my father-in-law asked me if I could play the violin for them, so I took out the violin that my girlfriend also played and I started to play ''Merry Go Round Life'' and they just applauded me, and that night I stayed at sleep with my girlfriend. Everything was still perfectly fine, I wish everything had been like that.\n\nThe sixth day was the day I spent the most time with my girlfriend, I did everything I wanted to do with her. We went to a video game center and we played Dance Dance Revolution, we both ate a very big cake in a pastry shop and we went to the movies before I have to go to work, before that she had said a few words to me that I really don't feel like I ever forget \"Honestly, I had a great time with you today, always since the first day we went out I've hoped that everything would be perfect as it is today, I love you\" and slowly, we had our first kiss. (Yeah, she was my ex but I have never kissed her, I am and I was too shy to do it). Then I went to work and I really began to doubt if it was real, and apparently it was, I had a great job, my girlfriend really loved me, I will show my talent as I always wanted, nothing could go wrong. And I just went home to sleep, really anxious about what would happen the next day.\n\nOn the 7th and last day, I was honestly afraid of ruining it like the last time I've been to an event, since I had mistakenly turned off all the music equipment, but my girlfriend was there supporting me, so, being in the stage that same day, shaking, seeing my girlfriend on stage reminding me that I have to relax, take a deep breath, and the play had started, the first song itself was just perfect, with everyone in the school screaming the emotion, and then I played the one that would show what I had been worth in all those days, I stood firm on the stage, and played together with a friend who played the piano with me...\r  \nAfter finishing, everything was silent, and suddenly everyone started screaming, teachers, and my girlfriend had even cried from what she had achieved, and shortly after, I woke up.\n\nI felt like that feeling of weight had climbed my body again, I couldn't let that life go, I couldn't go back to living as I always had, I couldn't.\r  \nI checked my contacts, no one was really my friend, no one I knew, I was never a nobody to anyone, and really, those days had never passed, she has not been there, really, I felt very sad. I didn't go to school that day, it took me too long to process that everything I had achieved I had lost, and everyone who was my friend really hadn't even had the slightest conversation with me, I want to go back and I want to feel the warmth and the lightness again what was that life\n\nCurrently, 3 months have passed since I dreamed that, and I'm still getting over the fact that I lost that life, that my life from the beginning could have been much better than it is. No one really believes me no matter how fanciful it may be, but you, the person who is watching this story, I hope you understand how painful it was for me to lose a life like that, full of that human warmth that I need so much and will need so much.\n\nThank u for reading",

It\u2019s against evolutionary optimization because you are never more vulnerable to predators than when you first wake up (other than being unconscious). Your brain makes it very difficult to focus on something that is not real when you awake for a reason.",

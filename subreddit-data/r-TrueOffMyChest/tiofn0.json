    "postText": "My parents got married when they were super young. My dad knocked up my mom, and their parents married them off. My grandfather was able to set up some business for my dad in a big city, and they moved here soon after my birth.\n\nMy mom grew up in a conservative southern town where she was taught to be a submissive wife. And even after moving to the big city, she didn't spend much time socializing. She had no friends and never went out. My dad was only there to provide for us. He was always away on business, and he wasn't there as a husband for my mom or as a father to me.\n\nMy dad made a lot of money, so we never lacked anything. Growing up, I became my mom's best friend. We would talk about everything. I pushed her to make friends and to find hobbies. After years of pushing, she started going to a nearby park and made her first friend, a gym trainer. Encouraged by her friend and me, she decided to join the gym.\n\nShe met a few more people there and started having some semblance of a social life, but she still continued to tell me everything.\n\nI think my dad's new secretary gave him the idea, but he asked my mom for an \"open marriage\" almost a year ago. He told her he wasn't happy in their marriage and that she wasn't providing him with everything he wanted.  My mom, who is a \"christian wife\", was mortified and told me about the proposal in tears. I suggested she get a divorce, but she said she didn't believe in it and she wouldn't be the one to end their marriage.\n\nAs my dad pushed, I knew exactly where this would end up if my mom agreed. Her friend and I convinced her. My mom was hesitant at first, but she agreed with the condition that they would be completely transparent with each other.\n\nMy dad was a middle aged (41) man with a belly and my mom (39) was an athletic woman who worked out regularly. I'm a 22 yo woman btw. I don't know how my dad was so blind or what he thought would happen. I helped create online dating profiles for my mom almost six months ago. After getting an insane number of matches, choosing from them and chatting with them for months, my mom started hooking up with a few people. Getting all this attention has provided a massive boost to her confidence and she seems better.\n\nMy dad hooked up with his secretary almost immediately. He's had very little luck with other ladies. With their transparency thing, my mom tells him about all her hook ups. A few weeks ago, my dad screamed at my mom for some minor thing. Usually, my mom would've apologised but with her new confidence, she didn't back down.\n\nIt's been constant fights the last few weeks. My dad keeps starting fights by making snide remarks about my mom's clothing or appearance. He almost even called my mom a whore but stopped himself. I think \"open marriage\" finally sunk in. My mom told me he tried to have a conversation about stopping their \"open marriage\" but she immediately shot it down. I think they'll split up.\n\nMy dad was never there for either of us but the thought of my parents splitting up still feels weird. I don't feel bad for my dad but I wish he put effort into his family. I'm happy for my mom though.\n\n**Update: (18 April, 2022)**\n\nA few days after my previous post, my dad left our home and had a divorce served to mom in a week. My grandparents didn't know about any of this, but my dad told them when he served the divorce. He also implied to them that my mom was cheating on him. Both sets of grandparents came to our home and started berating my mom. I kept screenshots of all my parents' communications, and my mom showed them to them and it got way worse after that. Grandparents started fighting each other blaming each other's children for causing all this.\u00a0 \n\nA few days after this, my mom's old \"church friends\" came to our home. Back when my mom used to go to church, they used to look down on her for being from a small town. My mom has always been a very caring and non-judgemental person, so she disagreed with their bigotry and they began excluding her from their activities. After she met her gym friends, my mom stopped going to church entirely. These \"church friends\" started calling my mom a slut and she kicked them out.\u00a0 \n\nMy mom is on a cut right now, so she has very defined abs and arms. So along with all the normal stuff getting thrown at her, my grandparents accused her of having a \"man body\" and she also had a lot of random transphobia thrown at her. Her trainer friend has been a great support through all this. She contacted the attorney she used for her divorce and my mom is spending a lot of time at her house.\u00a0 \n\nTurns out, the business my dad is running is owned by mom. It was set up by my mom's dad in her name, so it belongs to her. I did not know this until now and assumed that my dad owned it. The whole situation is a huge mess right now. Dad is living in some hotel and my grandparents left yesterday after a week of fighting and trying to force my parents back together. I know there's a lot more divorce drama to come but I hope it calms down for now.\u00a0 ",

So he basically wanted his wife's permission to bang his secretary and when that didn't work put he thought his \"reserve\" - in other words, the wife  - would be so grateful he came back to her that she would - what? Immediately end all the attention and self confidence she'd obtained?\n\nObviously you dad never did his research.  In \"open marriages\" it's almost always easier for the woman  to find a date than a man.",

I agreed because I did not think that she would pursue it seriously. On top of that, I did not think that she would attract many partners because she was very overweight.\n\nI was very wrong. \n\nShe may have been borderline obese, but she was also extremely pretty. She had a new offer every day. She made up for all the sex that she I was not able to provide her - plus some. \n\nMeanwhile, I figured out very quickly that I had no sexual market value whatsoever and the only way that I would be able to have sex was if I paid for it (which I could not do because I was broke on top of being a terrible lay).\n\nThe lesson I learned from that is that men who try to get their wives (or gfs) to opt for an open relationship seem to forget that just because you may not see them as sexy does not mean that there is not a line of men (or women) lined up and eager to get naked with them if they have the chance.\n\nEven the most attractive man could never match the sexual opportunities available to an average woman. This guy really screwed up and now he's probably not getting laid at all.",

Plus I felt a lot of guilt because of my porn addiction. I knew she was a very sexual person and it was really selfish of me to try and maintain a relationship that I could not give her what she needed.\n\nHer suggestion was not to be mean. I think she was just trying to figure out a way we could stay together without totally losing herself. \n\nShe knew about my porn problem and even told me that it was the most likely reason that I could not perform sexually. At the time, it was my only real coping mechanism for all the other problems I had and I would not give it up.\n\nI did finally start getting some real therapy and I was able to quit porn after going through a pretty rough withdrawal. People do not think of porn as an addiction, but anything you turn to that gives you a shot of dopamine, be it drugs, sex, food, or whatever, can lead to addictive behavior.\n\nI wish I had stopped years ago. I ruined most of my relationships due to my escapist method and I do not think that I will ever find anyone else like the people I lost.",

If he\u2019s willing to cheat on his wife like that, by demanding the right to sleep around and then throwing a tantrum when *she* does the same, then he\u2019s almost guaranteed to be just as horrid to any new woman he gets involved with.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting another trend: all of these men seem to be obsessed with chasing after women who are *completely out of their leagues.* Women who are much younger, more attractive, financially stable and independent enough to know what they\u2019re worth and not be willing to settle for someone who clearly treats his actual wife like shit. \n\nThese guys have been told their whole lives, by everyone from their parents to their peers to the media they consume, that they are \u201cGod\u2019s gift to women\u201d and that women are all easily-manipulated lustful animals that will fall all over themselves to get with a \u201csuccessful \u2018alpha male,\u2019\u201d etc.\n\nBut none of these men are anywhere near as successful or attractive as they believe themselves to be.\n\nThey\u2019re mediocre at best, so no one wants to waste time on some middle-aged mediocre asshole when they can have a relationship they actually *enjoy* with someone their own age who shares similar interests and treats them with actual respect.\n\nAnd it never, ever occurs to any of these men that their wives are *actual freaking PEOPLE* who someone else might find genuinely interesting and worth having a relationship with. Their wives were always just *things* to them, just servants and broodmares who they never expected to have any thoughts or feelings or interests or *self-worth* of their own.",

But most relationships aren't at that point. \n\nYour Dad wanted to fuck around, and by doing so he found out that which the rest of us already know. Women do far better in this realm than men. And, as a unintended consequence, he created a strong, confident woman, who will have no problem going forward. He could have done this without the \"open relationship \", and likely had a successful marriage. His loss.",

He convinced himself that she was sub-par and lucky to have him.\n\nLife is bitch-slapping him, and it will continue until he's broke and alone, then he will blame your mom to anyone who will listen.\n\nI recommend journaling *everything* right now, when it's all in the past you'll enjoy the reminders.",

He wanted it so he could openly cheat without feeling guilty, and hates that your mom moved on so fast. It does sound like they need a divorce, though. I bet he regrets asking for that open marriage now.",

The bedroom goes cold and the man wants sex and thinks an open relationship is the answer since the woman doesn\u2019t want to have sex with him. But since women typically have many many more options than men, the man gets little to nothing but the woman feels more emotionally cheated on and seeks out attention from other men, who want sex.",

Both of us grew closer and grew as people.\n\nWhen a large tree is felled the plants underneath finally grow with the new abundance of sunlight. Getting out from under the shadow of your father really helped your mother flourish! She deserves the happiness she suffered and worked for! I hope whatever happens gives happiness to the deserving and a reality-check and wake-up call to the other.",

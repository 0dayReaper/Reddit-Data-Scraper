    "postText": "I\u2019ll go first. Back in high school I had a female friend she was around 13-15. Around the same time there was a sound cloud rapper that would spend time at the local McDonald\u2019s. He would rap about going to prison for rape and I took his name and confirmed the charges brought to him. I then get Intel that he was hanging out with my underage friend. I just didn\u2019t know what to do, who to tell, and was scared of retaliation. He ended up raping her and sending a video threatening her and her family if she did anything about it. I know I have could\u2019ve prevented this but with restricted access on technology at the time I couldn\u2019t research my option and I just feel so much guilt knowing I had inside knowledge of multiple details that a registered sex offender was with a minor alone",

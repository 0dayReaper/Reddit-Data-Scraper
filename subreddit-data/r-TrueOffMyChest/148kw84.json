    "postText": "It started off with him trying to befriend me via the internet. We spent all of our free time together playing games, etc. Then he told me he loved me and everything spiraled.\n\nI was 14 and he was 19 when we met. He was engaged, told me how unhappy he was and that he wanted to leave her. That I completed him. I had low self esteem and had been abused as a young kid, he took advantage of how vulnerable I was. He used every trick in the groomer book, and by the end he controlled who I saw, what I did hour to hour, my whole brain belonged to him. The stress he inflicted kept me from even being able to think clearly. He severely gaslit me until I had no choice but to rely on him to tell me what was real. \n\nHe flew me out to see him across the ocean and we slept together. This was after his wedding. We had sex on the couch with his fiancee sleeping upstairs. Afterwards he berated me on my past sexual partners, made me go through and read outloud all the dirty texts I'd ever sent to anyone that wasn't him and shamed me for them. It was the worst I've ever felt in my life. I thought I loved him, I didn't know how to stop, even though I felt so guilty. I had no life without him, he made sure of that. \n\nI was 14 when we first got off together, me on video for him. Just a kid. Everyone always shits on affair partners and here I am, lost and still recovering from what happened. Was it my fault? Sometimes it still feels like I should've been smarter, done better.\n\nHe told his wife we slept together eventually, and she finally ended it. It took so long to rediscover my sense of self afterwards. She sides with him, calling me evil online and insinuating I seduced her poor depressed husband. They just had a baby as of this year, and he's working in a high paying tech job, moving through the ranks. Eventually he'll be another CEO with a secret dirty past. And the worst part is that as much as I want to, I can't get revenge. He made it very clear to me that he could ruin my life if I tried to speak out.",

He took advantage of a kid you are no way at fault he took advantage of your trauma and your circumstances. You should talk with a therapist and then maybe look for a lawyer to talk about what you can do to protect yourself and to write the wrongs done against you",

He is also a pretty solid hacker, and with what he knows about me would have access to all my accounts and info easily. Thinking about speaking up about it presents so many issues and I'm barely able to manage as is... trying to get my life back together, make friends again, go back to school, etc. \n\nI've been in therapy for years, I'm 25 now and pretty healed. Seriously dating a guy that I'd been on a few dates with back when I was 16. My groomer made me cut all ties with him because it was \"unsafe to hang out with random guys\". But we found each other again through chance all these years later and it's been wonderful!\n\nThank you for your kindness. I really appreciate it. I do fantasize about his kid growing up and me telling him what his father did to me, honestly.",

He shouldnt have that info but well if the police and banks were involved they could watch over your bank account and knowing he is a treat if anything happened they'd go after him.\n\nAwesome congrats to you, you deserve so much more and continue to find happiness. You could get him in jail with proof of him being a child predator so he wouldn't be able to do anything to you before he gets caught.\n\nYea id protect the kid from a parent like that, one that goes after kids. Plan things out, get all the evidence and talk to people who can get things done",

Ask if you can develop specific security questions because your accounts have been accessed by people that know you and you want them to be secure. Yes he\u2019s a \u201chacker\u201d but there are still things that can be done to minimize his ability to access things. You can also make sure to coordinate online access through specific devices only with 2 or 3 factor authentication in order to protect your stuff. \n\nHe can\u2019t ruin you more than you can ruin him. Don\u2019t give him that power over you.",

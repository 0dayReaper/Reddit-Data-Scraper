Decided after 6 months that I didnt want to do that anymore but stayed as an oil change tech while I've been in college. Basically ruined my knees and legs. I did 6 months of PT last year because I would wake up almost in tears because of the pain. That helped a bit but I still have flare ups in my calves and knee every now and again. But I've been having consistent tingling and numbness in my left leg for the past month and my balance has been out of whack because of it.",

They were dead wrong. As long as it doesn\u2019t rule your life it can certainly buy happiness. Having enough money where you could take a year or two off during your prime to enjoy life is something you can only do with excess money.\n\nI\u2019ve been unemployed a couple times and it\u2019s terrible if you don\u2019t have any money saved up. But if you can afford to live comfortably for a few months until you find that next job it\u2019s heaven, I never felt so free in my adult life.\n\nI\u2019d love nothing more than to not HAVE to work.",

You shouldnt have to wait to live and telling people the average american dream is the only way is a terrible idea.\n\n\"Your health will decline and you'll barely see your kids but hey, you'll have like 3 nice days out the year\" \n\nNo. I'm not living like that. That's no way to live. I've already found my out, I'll be able to do as I please and live like a HUMAN. Seeing all there is to see. Not just 4 walls and people acting like they give a damn. \n\nEnjoy some moments yes but also realize there are MANY ways out of the 9-5 slavelife everyone lied about being so great. I've already found about 5. Capitalizing on those I'll finally be able to see my friends again. A couple of which have already died. Do not tell me to enjoy the slave life. I won't. I will enjoy the freedom I've found by getting out of it.\n\nI hope I can help others get their lives back as well.",

People in the company I work in will talk shit about people that don\u2019t come in on weekends all the time, and honestly I couldn\u2019t care less. Its a tough job on your body, some guys in my company are in their early 50s and their backs and knees are so fucked up that their quality of life sucks, but they still work. I don\u2019t think like the guys I work with and it pisses some people off. My grandfather always told me you are dead longer than you are alive. So to that I say, why put every waking moment you have into working towards something that isn\u2019t even guaranteed? You could work every weekend and week day for the next 5 years and save all that money and be quite comfortable and have a big house and nice car, but at what cost? You could die tomorrow and all that money means nothing, at the end of the day your life is only as good as the memories you have and it doesn\u2019t matter how much money is in your bank account when you\u2019re dead. People sacrifice their health and time for money, and it doesn\u2019t make any sense to me.",

It's not just a lawn for \"the kids and dog\" (not that I have either, nor want either) but assuming I did I'm not busting my ass even harder just for them to have a patch of grass they'll barely play on when they're more engaged in their tablets/games/YouTubers etc. And any suburb that doesn't completely suck is bound to have some parks or other free communal outdoor spaces if having a place to run around in means that much.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI mean I grew up in houses that always had yards and used to think how much it would *suck* to be one of the kids who didn't. But looking back now our yards were small and I have only a few memories of stuff that happened in them as they weren't utilized much. They spent as much time being maintained as they were being enjoyed. When we finally got a place with a pool for a few years it was amazing just how little it was used (I did use it the most though, I still love being in the water and always tried to get my family involved but they rarely did so beyond me the pool was kind of a waste too). Then again I grew up with a fraction of the at-home entertainment options that have sprung up in the past 15 years. Kids then really did get bored at home easily - kids now I just can't see that being as much of an issue with. Either way unless your'e a passionate garden lover like me, or have multiple dogs - then in most cases a yard for most people is just a rarely-used patch of grass that they pay to own and maintain just to have it there for a barbecue or party that might happen once a year. At best it serves as a place to hang your clothes to dry and as a buffer between you and your neighbours so you hear every little noise they make. If I didn't love gardening I'd not even bother paying for a house - I'd get a smaller but decent enough apartment in a more exciting area to live in for the same money as owning a slice of suburban *dream* is costing me. But some potted plants on an inner city balcony ain't a garden.",

We as humans make war on disease and the elements if they threaten our livelihood. Now if we feel abused and threatened by other humans, not only is it perfectly justified to make war on them, but as fully conscious beings of their own we can actually hold them more accountable for the problems they've caused. And I say this as someone whose family has benefited from these sort of machinations in the past, and I myself continue to benefit from the unfair real estate sector.\n\nSo I don't really agree with this kind of attitude. 'Life's not fair' is at times one of the least helpful, if not downright counterproductive, common phrases I know. One of those general ideas that reeks of faux-profundity. They're words I live by myself at times, but that's only because I'm lucky and financially selfish. If I was a bit worse off, I'd be livid that the system wasn't built to reward me. The bottom line is that we all know the world and society isn't fair, but that's not the point at all. The point is whether or to what extent we are trying to make it fairer or not.",

You don't choose to be born and yet you're forced into a system that requires you to sacrifice during the prime of your life to be able to enjoy life once your health and body start to diminish. And this doesn't really touch on the sacrifices of necessities, like proper healthcare and education, when you're trying to save up to just survive your older years. There is no safety net in place for those who encounter too many unavoidable obstacles to properly save for retirement, and that is just a shame. We have limited time in this life and yet we have built systems that require us to limit the amount of experiences we can have and settle for the little things in life. We should have the option to experience the little things and the bigger things in life without so many sacrifices.",

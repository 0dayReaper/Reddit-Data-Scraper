    "postText": "This feels so overwhelming. About 2 weeks ago, I saw my boyfriend\u2019s search history. He\u2019s deployed with no communication for 5 months. I\u2019m 3 months pregnant. I\u2019m fully aware that the majority of men watch porn, and my stance has always been \u201cthat\u2019s his business.\u201d\n\nSomething about seeing the actual history though\u2026 it just broke me. Realizing on the morning he left for deployment, he watched porn for an hour before calling me. \n\nOn our last night together, he was watching porn in bed after we had sex, while I was asleep. \n\nOn the day we found out I was pregnant, he watched porn right after we got home from church. \n\nOn the day of our ultrasound and seeing the baby, he watched porn as soon as we got home.\n\nSince January 1st, there have been 12 days where he didn\u2019t watch porn. I know logically that it\u2019s not about me - it\u2019s a maladaptive coping strategy, a habit from adolescence that has wired his brain to seek unnatural levels of dopamine.\n\nI wish so badly that I didn\u2019t feel so affected by this. That I could be the \u201ccool, understanding girlfriend\u201d that doesn\u2019t mind. Who isn\u2019t insecure. But now I find myself in bed at 2am, googling costs for labia reduction surgery. Wondering if I should bleach my intimate areas. Strongly considering breast implants after I\u2019m done having babies. \n\nI know that I could be a literal porn star and it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to keep him from watching so much porn. I\u2019m not ugly by any means, and I\u2019ve always had good self esteem. But this\u2026 this has destroyed me. I have a small chest, and he says he loves my boobs. But it\u2019s a lie. If he didn\u2019t know me, there\u2019s no way he would choose to look at a photo or video of my body over one of these ridiculously busty women. He\u2019s a boob guy, and that\u2019s a fact. I can never be enough in that department without surgery.\n\nI had booked a boudoir shoot to memorialize my pre-baby body. It\u2019s on Wednesday. I should be excited for this, but my confidence has never been lower. Every time I look at my breasts I start to cry. I HATE what this has done to me. I hate feeling so inadequate. I\u2019ve done so much work to get to this place of self-love and appreciation for my body, and it\u2019s all gone the instant I saw all those women he\u2019s looking at to get his dopamine fix.\n\nI think what hurts the most is that all those intimate, vulnerable, important moments in our lives - the ultrasound, our last night together - are now tainted by the knowledge that he was watching porn as soon as he could get away. I just feel so, so low. Those memories have been ruined.\n\nHere\u2019s the worst part: WHILE I was typing this post I got a surprise unexpected call from him. It was so good to hear his voice. And then I checked his history, and yep\u2026 was watching porn before he called me. Now we\u2019re off the phone, and he\u2019s watching it again right now. What the FUCK.\n\nThe truth is, he\u2019s probably going to be watching porn on our wedding day. On our honeymoon. When our child is born. How the hell am I supposed to enjoy these moments, knowing what I know now? I just don\u2019t understand. I have to sit with this knowledge for 5 months. I can\u2019t talk to my friends, my mom, or my pastor for support because I want to protect his reputation. So I\u2019m dealing with this pain, pregnant and alone. Screaming into the void on Reddit. Shit sucks.",

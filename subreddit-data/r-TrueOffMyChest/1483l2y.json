    "postText": "TW: Sexual assault \n\nSo a bit of backstory I am a somewhat openly bisexual man in what is quite a heterosexual sporting environment. I play sport at quite a high level and so it\u2019s quite a masculine environment. \n\nSo about 3 weeks ago, I went to a university sports ball for an awards ceremony and someone who I felt was my friend sexually assaulted me throughout the night after I repeatedly told him I wasn\u2019t interested. It was during the start of the dinner (just before the awards were being handed out) when I felt a hand stroke my thigh and try to grab my crotch. I felt so scared and froze for a couple of seconds to register what happened but I took his hand away to make sure he knew I was into that. Assuming it was unintentional I didn\u2019t really put too much thought into, perhaps he didn\u2019t mean it. But, after about 10 minutes or so he then did it again but rather than stroke my thigh he went for my crotch and tried to squeeze it. I froze and didn\u2019t know what to do so went to the loo to get some space, just wanting to go home and be alone but I couldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t really want to discuss it but throughout the night he sexually assaulted me further wether it was grabbing my butt or grabbing my waist, to pull me closer. \n\n\nI feel so ashamed especially because I am a guy who was assaulted by another guy and there is such a big masculine culture I can\u2019t really talk about it. It affects me to this day and I have been missing out on socials as I feel unable to be even in the same room as him. \n\nTLSS: I am a guy who was assaulted by another guy at a university sports award ball. I feel so ashamed about what happened.",

It sucks.\n\nNot much I can do except give prayers and encouragement from this end.\n\nConfront him is what I'd do. Let him know that if he does it again, you'll press charges",

Like some else has commented, have proof of telling him that you will press charges if he tries anything with you. I hope others have some legal advice that could help as well. You need to tell the leaders/authorities about this situation so this abuser can\u2019t molest others in the future. \n\nFrankly, more than being \u201cmasculine\u201d, it is very childish to say things like, \u201coh if i was there, I would\u2019ve beat him up!\u201d Mature people understand that in extreme situations, we all react differently. Now just put in preventative measures to keep yourself safe and in a safe environment. Standing up for yourself and trying to protect others is pretty manly in my opinion. You have had time to process what happened, now you can make a more clear decision on how to act with the information and situation at hand. \n\nPlease talk to a counselor and therapist for mor advice and for comfort as well.",

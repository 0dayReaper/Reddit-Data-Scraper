    "postText": "I (17 F) went outside for the first time yesterday without my mom. \n\nYesterday I was asking my mom (47 F) if I can walk to the Dollar Tree since she's busy doing school work. She's doing online college to get more licenses in the fields she works. She said no. I keep asking and the more I think about it the more I realise I should have done this before already.\n\nI look up how far the Dollar Tree is (17 minute walk) and begin attempts at convincing my mother to let me do it. She says after a while she'll take me once she's done. By this point I'd solidified in my mind NO I want to go alone. She says \"How about when I'm done I walk with you and see if you complain\" ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOT \n\n I have walked places with my mother MANY times before. I *hate it.* She speed walks everywhere and the few times she'll stop and let me rest she spends the whole time not shutting up about it's \"not that bad\" and pressuring me to keep walking. \n\nI wanted to go alone. I HAD TO GO ALONE. I am 17 and have never walked out the house alone. \n\n \"Most kids would be asking to do drugs and I'm here asking to walk to the STORE with my own money. I shouldn't even have to ask.\" \n\n \"No asks to do drugs.\" \n\n \"Exactly so why am I asking to go to the store???\" \n\n I went on rants about how it's oppressive and I feel like a hostage in my own home. \n\n \"You can't expect more responsibility if you can't handle the ones you have.\"\n\n \"It's not a responsibility to get myself to the store and back alive. It's my body and my money.\"\n\nGuys I just wanted snacks. I shouldn't have had to do so much. \n\n \"You just wanna do what you wanna do when you wanna do.\"\n\n \"You just described independence and freedom. You just want me to do what YOU want ME to do when you want me to do it. You want me to be dependent.\" I think I also equated it to slavery. If so I still mean it.\n\nAfter a bit it's just me yelling at her. I go upstairs and ponder it for a bit. I message some friends. One who's 17 (M) so I get an opinion from someone my age. Another who's 21 (M) so I get an opinion from an adult. Both say this is crazy and I should be allowed. \n\nI grab my thigh highs. Socks my mom is against me wearing everywhere. I change my shirt to something less heavy cause it's hot outside. I put on shoes. With every step down the steps I am more confident. More ready. I grab my purse. \n\n \"Where do you think you're going?\" \n\n \"To the store.\" \n\n \"You better not leave out that door\"\n\n \"Bye\" \n\nI move Poochie (our doggo) with my foot cause he wants to go with me but I take him in a store. My mom keeps protesting. I leave the house and get my house key to lock the door. I start heading out. I'd already made sure my phone was charged. I went across the street and was following my GPS. I immediately got confused. I have never used GPS.\n\nThe arrow thing wasn't moving with me so I didn't know what to do. I'm sure some people saw me trying to figure out if it was left or right. Left had road work so I went right. The arrow walked with my and I realised it's not an arrow. Just a marker that looks like an arrow.\n\nIn that moment I figure out the GPS and start walking. After a couple minutes my mom calls me and asks where I am.\n\n \"Outside\"\n\n \"Where?\"\n\n \"On Turnip\" (fake street - I had been walking right past the sign)\n\nShe then just said to call when I get there and when I'm on my way home. I think she realised there was no way in hell I was just walking back without making it to the store. My thoughts were.\n\n \"It's not that hot\"\n\n \"I wish I brought a water\"\n\n \"kinda gotta pee\" \n\n \"I recognise that store\" \n\n \"Almost there\" \n\nThen I saw Dollar Tree and I walked to it. I obeyed all laws of street crossing the very few times I had to. I called my mom. I told her I made it to the store. I went in and picked out my stuff. 3 XL burritos, 2 cases of Tapioca Pudding, a vanilla filled croissant, 2 boxes of mini pies, and 2 Gatorades. They sadly had no better drinks and no string cheese. Gatorade tastes good and since it's a sports drink I figured it'd get me through. \n\nI check out which I always do alone whenever my mom is taking a while to get her stuff. When I'm done I drink a bunch of the Gatorade after going back outside. I call my mom and say I'm heading back. I set the GPS. On the way I notice 3 dogs barking at me from a balcony. I wave at them from across the road as I drink some more. This was my first and only rest stop. \n\nBefore the dogs I did walk into some sinking mud and panicked realising I was on the other side of the black tape thing and had to go back. Bottom of my shoes are dirty lol. \n\nI was an empty bag in my hand and had a small heart attack. I looked behind me thinking I'd lost the contents of one of my bags. I look at my bags. I still have 2 and the cashier just attached an extra to one of my bags. I breathe a sigh of relief. I keep walking and notice a rip 5 minutes away from home. \"Oh fuck.\" I keep reassuring the bag and telling it not to rip open. \n\n I see the collection of houses and from there I know how to get home. That is when I start feeling the exhaustion and suffering from having walked almost 2 miles. I get home and say: \"I spoke to 8 strangers, bent over twice in the road for pennies, and was murdered no less than 3 times.\" \n\nMy mom refused to look at or speak to me the rest of the day. Poochie was happy to see me and greeted me warmly. The dog has been more supportive of me in 2 years than my mom has been my whole life. \n\nVanilla Croissants hit different when you feel like you're dying. This was a worthwhile adventure. Thank you for reading my story of my very first time outside. I touched grass. It was glorious. I feel free and I'm glad I left. \n\nMy mom didn't forbid me cause of some leaving the nest thing. She's always like this. She thrives on control. Soon as I started defying her will she got a lot harder on my sister who's 16 next month and is still convinced she shouldn't have roblox cause it has chatting. This was just another time when I destroyed my mother's world view. My own as well. Leaving still feels like a dream. She has no idea how to process that I just up and walked out. To be honest, it's weird for me too. \n\nMy mom has been trying to convince me to go straight to college after Senior Year and get a job. I want a job. I've been searching. But I plan on waiting for college and doing it overseas in the UK. I have friends in the UK and I've been planning this since I was 14. She really wants me going straight to college in the US. She can't wait to have me gone. My mom has never liked me and at this point I'm over it. I'm not just letting myself sit here anymore. \n\nThis was an odd display of independence but it was mine. I had fun. I feel great. 11/10 would leave again. \n\n I do not recommended sneaking out especially if you're young as it IS dangerous but at a certain age you should be allowed to do certain things. Nothing extreme or illegal (like vaping or drugs) but small things that are part of every day life. \n\nI'm not a parent. But I have younger friends who see me as one. Let your kids grow because if you don't they'll just do it without you. Teach them what they need to know so they grow up safely and support them when the time comes. One day you won't be there to guide them. Don't let that day start when your kid is 11. I no longer trust my mother. Haven't for a long time. I don't see her as someone who I can turn to. She stopped being my mom when I was around 14. She was stunting my growth so I let other people dictate how I grow. Luckily for me I had good influences. Your kids might not. So support your kids. Be proud when they grow up. Celebrate with them because other people will even if you don't.\n\nMy dog is proud of me. So are all the friends I told. I celebrated. My mom wasn't there but then again, she never really is. I'm not upset. Hell I'm not even disappointed. :) Her shame and disappointment empowers me.\n\nAgain, thanks for reading. &lt;3",

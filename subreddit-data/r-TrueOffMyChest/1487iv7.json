Only thing is we are great friends at the moment, and I feel like I'm out of her league on many levels, we have been talking for almost 2 months. Any feedback or advice is welcome",

Or she could just show you around?\n\nOr you just flat-out tell her that you like her and would love to meet her.\n\n2 Months should be plenty of time for her to form an opinion about you, so her reaction alone should tell you already what you need to know.",

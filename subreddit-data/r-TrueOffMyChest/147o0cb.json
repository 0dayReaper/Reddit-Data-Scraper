    "postText": "Just as the title says, i (18f) am undeniably ugly. My nose is too big, my features are asymmetric, my smile is crooked, my forehead is big and square, and my hair is too thin to cover it. I am naturally chubby, and it\u2019s hard for me to lose weight due to my slow metabolism (i had it checked and the doctor basically laughed in my face because of how slow it was). I have some redeeming qualities but they don\u2019t make up the fact that i am just ugly. I don\u2019t feel feminine at all, sometimes not even human-looking.\nI\u2019ve never had someone call me beautiful, i\u2019ve never had a girlfriend (i\u2019m a lesbian), and all the people i have been with were moderately drunk. I\u2019ve never been catcalled on the streets, which is something i should be grateful for but it makes me feel less of a woman.\nI try to compensate for my lack of beauty with hobbies and personality. I am passionate about many things (soccer, video games, music, fashion, art, photography, technology and so on) and i can do a lot of things. I love reading and working on myself and on my personal culture. But no matter what i do, people are never interested in me because of my appearance and i\u2019m never seen as a potential romantic interest.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for me to talk about this to anyone, so i\u2019ve only opened up to my family. They always reassure me and say that i\u2019m not ugly, but since they\u2019re my family i can\u2019t fully believe them. I\u2019ve tried talking to a therapist, but he basically said that i\u2019ll feel beautiful when someone special tells me i am (which is never going to happen).\n\nThis situation is worsened by the fact that while i inherited both of my parents worst genetics (i look exactly like my father - eldest daughter curse), my brother (16) and sister (14) are good looking. My sister in particular has somehow won the genetic lottery (weird, since my parents are not exactly good looking), and she is stunningly beautiful, like jaw-dropping pretty. This is a big low blow to my self esteem, because no big sister wants to feel inferior to their younger sister. She has bested me in everything that relates to looks or romance (for example, i had my first kiss at 17, she had hers at 12), and even if i feel bad comparing myself to her i can\u2019t help it. I try to always be a good older sister: i reassure her on her insecurities and i always tell her how beautiful she is. I would never dream of putting her down or show resentment towards her in any way, but still the feelings are there.\n\nThere\u2019s not much else to add. I have to make peace with the fact that my looks will always prevent me from experiencing normal human things like feeling loved, wanted or desired. It\u2019s honestly so hard, living like this is hard, but i\u2019ll push through. I\u2019ve graduated high school this year and from this summer on i will be able to have more time to exercise and get in shape, but i am aware i can\u2019t do much about my face.\nThanks for reading guys. If you have any suggestion for my situation or want to share something in the comments please do so.\nI just needed to rant somewhere.",

            "comment": "From someone who always has prettier friends: being attractive to people can be achieved without being conventionally pretty. *Depressed-I-Hate-Myself*-Me gets no attention from anyone, while *I-Am-Feeling-Really-Good-About-Myself*-Me does alright, even when my wayyy prettier friends are around. I haven't figured out the mechanics behind this, so I'll just call it \"Confidence Superpower.\" \n\nGetting out off this slumb will probably mean working to embrace yourself and your looks. Don't bother waiting for someone else to validate you, it's much more valuable it if you can validate yourself. Maybe your therapist can help you with that.",

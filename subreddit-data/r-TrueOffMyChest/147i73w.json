    "postText": "Pretty niche thing to admit, but I wanted to put it somewhere\n\nTL;DR\nEveryone assumes I'm obsessed with bees and it's all because I like honey in my tea and started calling my boyfriend honeybee. Now everything associated with me is bee themed.\n\nSo for context, my personality to everyone around be is being obsessed with bees and honey. Everything my family gets me for birthdays, Christmas and Hanukkah is bee themed, I call my boyfriend honeybee, and any time one gets near a family member with an allergy, I'm called over to grab it and take it somewhere else. If I'm honest though, I really wasn't ever obsessed with bees.\n\nIt started with honey sticks. The little tubes of different flavors of honey that you can suck on or put in tea. I would get them for my tea, and eventually my family would get them for me all the time because I loved them so much. Then it moved on to full jars of specialty and artisan honey because i \"loved honey so much\". This went on for a while, but didn't progress into the bee obsession just yet.\n\nWhat really kicked it off was a single TikTok. It was a video of a wife not using a pet name on her husband to see his reaction. With a confused look on his face he asked, \"am I not your honeybee?\" And with that I just really liked the name, so when I started dating my boyfriend I used it. It was cute and sweet, and I never liked the name baby. From that point forward, it has snowballed to be the one thing about me everyone remembers. Everyone just assumes I really really love bees. I guess at this point I do, but still a bit surprised how I ended up here",

    "postText": "When I was younger, I used to think \u201cif I was an alien visiting Earth and wanted to save the dinosaurs right before extinction , I would save the most intelligent one (like a velociraptor) put them on a red drawf star and would see if it would evolve into the little grey/green aliens we talk about today.  I think it probably would. \n\nA planet orbiting a red dwarf star is perfect to evolve simple beings into highly intelligent life.  They would have millions and maybe a billion years to evolve as a red dwarf is more stable than our own Sun. \n\nRed dwarf star, a planet has to be closer to be in the habitable zone, more radiation .  Red dwarf would be dimmer as well, less light. \n\nWhat would be perfect evolution for this?  Big black eyes to bring in more light and thick skin for radiation protection.  Deep water fish lacks sun light and we can easily get our reason for grey skin. But let\u2019s take it further to evolve into a green skin to help see each other easier in dim lighting (similar to night vision goggles).  \n\nMore intelligence would increase head size and not needing to use verbal communication would lead to shrinkage in the mouth and ears.  \n\nWhy did I pick velociraptor? It\u2019s been theorized since I was a little kid that they were intelligent enough to hunt in packs and communicate with one another.  A better chance of survival on a new environment.  \n\nWe mammals came to existing simply because dinosaurs went extinct. We were basically nothing more than a scavenging weasel during those times because we were easy prey for dinosaurs.  KT extinction got them but not us since we (our ancestral weasel) lived mostly underground.  This allowed us to start roaming the earth to what all the mammals on Earth.  \n\nSo either an advanced alien saved a few dinosaurs and put these dinosaurs on a planet orbiting a red dwarf to evolve into highly intelligent beings far beyond us (65 million years head start) and now are visible their ancestral home world OR most highly intelligent life capable of interstellar space travel are mostly evolved on planets orbiting red dwarfs therefore explaining why they have big black eyes, grey/green skin, etc.",

            "comment": "Got any evidence for any of that? There are so many holes in your argument:\n\n* Unsuitability of red dwarfs for habitable planets.\n* Paucity of time for aliens to master large-scale interstellar travel in time.\n* Insurmountable structural differences between dromaeosaurids and primate-like Greys.\n* Underplaying the status and survivability of mammals during the late Cretaceous.\n* Unnecessary extra steps: why not just pretend that the Greys *are* the original visitors?\n\nIt's a pretty story, but just like Larry Niven's story that Homo Habilis were marooned on Earth by a failed alien colony, it completely fails to hold any water when examined with even the slightest scientific knowledge.",

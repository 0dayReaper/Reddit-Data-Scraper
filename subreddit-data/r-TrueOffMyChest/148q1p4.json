    "postText": "Before I start this I know this is probably some form of twisted karma coming back to get my ass but I still feel sad even if it\u2019s my own fault and I just need to talk about it\n\nMy ex (who we\u2019ll call A) and me dated for about a year before we broke up because it became too toxic at the end and I couldn\u2019t deal with it and the constant fighting and mental abuse she kept giving me. A month or so before we broke up i because friends with benefits with my girlfriend (who we\u2019ll call M) and cheated. I\u2019ll admit it I know it was wrong and I should\u2019ve just broke it off but it felt good to have someone that actually treated me like they cared about me and like they actually loved me for once and eventually I needed up develpoping feelings for M and we had a quick like month long relationship before she wanted to break things off because she \u201cdidn\u2019t want a relationship ship rn\u201d which I thought was weird but fine. Now I had know that M was Interested in girls but up to this point I\u2019d thought it was because she was Bi sexual and not gay and was the one that came to me about wanting to be friends with benefits first. So today I check Ms story and it\u2019s a picture of A saying she\u2019s perfect and A has a picture of M on her saying the same and when I asked M she said that they were dating now and when I asked about breaking up she said \u201cI mean with a man rn, I\u2019m gay\u201d and I was like oh okay so just fuck me I guess? Then A starts texting me bragging about stealing my girl now and just trying to get to me. \n\nI know that this is all my bad shit that I\u2019ve done coming back to get me now but still I just don\u2019t really know how to feel rn and I know I\u2019m a piece of shit",

You can learn from this not to stay in an unhealthy relationship, especially if there\u2019s abuse of any kind. And I really doubt they\u2019re as happy as they seem. It sounds more like they teamed up to try and hurt you. I\u2019d strongly suggest blocking them both and moving on with your life. Learn about healthy relationships and how they work, so you\u2019re better able to find healthy partners and be a healthy partner.",

It sounds like you\u2019re holding onto a lot of pain from the relationship (understandable) and you could use some help sorting it out. Guilt is helpful if it helps you learn how to be a better person but if it\u2019s holding you back from being able to live a good life or feel like you deserve to be happy than that\u2019s not helping anyone. The world doesn\u2019t benefit from you feeling like shit about yourself forever. \n\nAlso, karma is a tricky thing. Sometimes it can take years for people to learn from their mistakes. Some people never do. You can\u2019t assume she\u2019s happy just because she\u2019s pretending to be on the internet.",

She is not innocent, but you are definitely sounding like the villain. \n\nVerbal abuse is unacceptable so you leave the person, you don\u2019t start a smear campaign, you shouldn\u2019t get even, you shouldn\u2019t cheat on them, just cut the ties and find happiness elsewhere.\n\nWhat you did COULD have emotionally destroyed her, but since she\u2019s luckily a resilient person it has not. You are not off the hook. You also come off as someone who deflects and doesn\u2019t take criticism well. \n\nNow how would you define her verbals abuse ? Have any examples ??",

When my childhood cat died she also just told me to suck it up and act like I couldn\u2019t be sad even though when her pet hamster died all I did was comfort her and ask if she was okay and needed anything and try to be there for her. I would also constantly get shot down literally any attempt I made to do practically anything like dates to places she wouldn\u2019t wanna go to despite me constantly going places I hated going with her she never thought to do the same for me along with any time I was happy or feeling good about myself she\u2019d just shoot that down instantly too and never let me feel good",

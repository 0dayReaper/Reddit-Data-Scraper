    "postText": "For backstory:\n I'm 17 F and my friend 18 F had an incident a year ago. Where my friend came over without her mom permission and her mom caught her. Her mom called me upset and asking me if my friend was really at my place. I lied to cover for my friend yet its backfired horribly her mom basically threaten and cuss me out. \"Stay away from her daughter or I'll beat your ass.\"I was 16 at the time and I just wasn't going to mention this  incident to anyone at home. What i didnt realized is that my phone was extremely loud and so my mom heard and was very upset obviously.\n A whole year later now present day my mom finally let's me hang out my friend and her mom and I already had talked already. We're all good. But my friend texted me \"hey if my mom ever ask u how was the spider man movie tell her it was great\" I was confused yet respond with an okay? She texted  me that she had lied to her mom. I texted her why and that I just came into good terms with her mother. She texted me she's joking. Yet I feel like she wasn't so I texted her \"I'm about to wait a another year\" like a joke wishing it was. Yet all I got was a \"maybe.\" Of course I panicked I don't wanna be in the same situation. I texted her \"what did you do?\" She responded \"nothinggg\" I texted her immediately and no response. It's been 2 hours and I'm scared and overthinking everything. Feeling like I'm going to be in trouble when I had no involved. I didn't ask to be the scapegoat.",

You\u2019ve let your friend ruin your reputation in other people\u2019s eyes because you\u2019re afraid of them lashing out bc they can\u2019t face the consequences of their own actions. Your friend is using you to put themselves into a bad position. They could get seriously hurt and nobody would know because you were too afraid to disappoint them. If this person was responsible enough to actually have a friend like you, they wouldn\u2019t be using you. You deserve better.",

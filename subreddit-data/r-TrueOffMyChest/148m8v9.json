    "postText": "My friends are usually open to me about their problems, and I'm alright with that. But whenever they start asking for advice, it makes me feel like I'd be responsible for what they'll do next. I absolutely hate it, they turn to me like I know everything, but I don't. And it's taking a toll on my mental health, 'cuz it makes me feel like I should be the strong one among them, mentally, but I really am not. It had come to the point where I can't even tell anyone my own problems 'cuz I'm so used to be the one people tell their problems to. And it makes me think that if I tell anyone my problems that they either won't reciprocate the energy that I give them whenever, or that they'd see me less of a person.",

    "postText": "For context i am a developmental biology student in my 3rd year of uni, me and my best friend chose this major together and have being studying together all 3yrs of uni \nWe had an assignment for the second semester and we had to write a scientific article about a specific subject and we had 2 and a half months t prepare it \nI am a major procrastinator when it comes to assignments, but when someone else is involved i make sure to do the job as of there grade is gonna be affected by my work, also this was a very important subject because it hade a big impact on yr general grade; and that\u2019s why i started working on my part (we divided the work between us)  as soon as i could and took every free time i had to work on it since i wanted it to be perfect.\nI kept asking my friend every once in a while about the progress that she made and she kept avoiding to answer, two weeks before the due date i asked about her progress and she avoided the topic, a mutual friend of ours told me that she told her she made no progress because she hadn\u2019t start working on it yet, my stress level went to the roof since it was a big part of my grade and i need to pass so i finished her part to just in case she didn\u2019t deliver anything, and that\u2019s exactly what happened, she texted me 2 days before the due date telling me she had problems (she did not) and bunch of excuses as to why she hadn\u2019t done anything and needed my help to finish, i told her that it wasn\u2019t my problem and it was supposed to be a team work assignment and it was only fair if she did her part, she got mad at me and went behind my back and told the teacher she couldn\u2019t be present on the day of the presentation but had sent me her part and didn\u2019t inform me.\nThe day of the presentation i found myself alone, thankfully i was prepared and presented the work by myself, at the end the teacher asked me to point out the work that my friend did and i said that i did all the work alone, the teacher told me that if it\u2019s the case he\u2019s gonna have to give her a 0 and make her fail the class, i explained that i spent 2 months asking her about progress and when i realized she made none i went a head and did the work myself and that she sent me nothing i even showed him my emails to confirm \nAfter the teacher sent us our grades she called me yelling and telling me i was the biggest AS because i could\u2019ve helped her on the assignment since i already did everything or at least lie the the teacher and say we shared the work and it would change nothing because i got the best grade in class i i didn\u2019t need to be such a brat \nNow it\u2019s been months and we haven\u2019t spoken since it happened, i tried to reach out cuz i truly believe that i did the right thing an she should\u2019ve done her part but she still refuses to talk to me \nI feel alot of regret and sometimes wish i hadn\u2019t done that but at the same time it\u2019s not fair for me to do all the work and her to easily take the grade\n\nNOTE: it\u2019s not the first time she does this, i do majority of the work in all shared assignments only this time i was fed up",

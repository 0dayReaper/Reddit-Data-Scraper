I yelled at him WTF constantly and he nonchantly said that he was just \"marking his territory\" and went on about how he's been wanting to do this when he gets married and that he didn't tell me because he was positively 100% sure I'd get mad at him but he said it's worth it since he got to do it. I couldn't believe it but he assured me that pee washes off easily and I shouldn't worry but I was just so mad and disgusted vy what he's done. He acted like nothing happened and was actually expecting sex but I told him off. I just can't get rid of the awful feeling and sight, I couldn't even sleep in the bed with him after that.",

You let them find and consume the spoils of their efforts. While there are still scraps in the mid-level stash you get another package and you find an excellent hiding spot. At this point they aren't looking because they think they've already found your stash. After you've gotten your fill of Oreos, you hide the remnants in another mid-level hiding place. This way they always think they've outsmarted you and found your stash, but you always get what you want before sharing the leftovers with them. My kids still don't know my good hiding spot.",

This means he very clearly does not care for or respect you or your feelings, he literally admitted it. When people tell you who they are believe them. He told you that you being upset is worth it as long as he gets to do something he wants to do. You can leave now that he's shown you who he is or you can keep having this same problem over and over again, there's no way this is a one time only non precedent setting event, he will continue to believe that it's worth it no matter how much it upsets you and he will continue to act like you being upset doesn't matter or that his violations are no big deal.

Basically, her new husband now thinks he owns her. (If a male wolf tried the equivalent of that shit with a female wolf, she'd probably kick his ass. Male wolves are often reticent to hurt females.)",

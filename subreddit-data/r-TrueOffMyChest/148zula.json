    "postText": "My friend and I have a great relationship and he is someone who does me a lot of good, he is definitely one of the people I want to have with me throughout my life. We've been friends for a few years now.\n\nLately, he started complaining about some things in his relationship and the way he is treated by his girlfriend, and I developed some negative feelings towards her. I have a low opinion of her and I don't think it's a healthy relationship, but I never told him that. The problem started when I realized that these \"negative feelings\" started to bother me more than they should, and I ended up realizing that I bothered so much because at some point I developed feelings for him. Ever since I realized this, I've been constantly feeling bad. I see myself as a terrible person because I feel like I'm not being fair to him... he trusts me as a friend and I'm afraid he'll be disappointed if he finds out I see him differently. Also, I feel like this is suffocating me but I don't have the courage to talk to him about it for fear of him changing the way he treats me and wanting to get away from me. What I least want is to get away from him, I wish I could swallow my own feelings about this and continue to have the friendship I always had with him. Apart from all that, I also feel like a terrible person for having developed feelings for someone committed.\n\nI do not know what to do. I don't want to get away from him, I really like the friendship we have and it makes me feel good. But at the same time, I've been feeling sad these last few weeks because of it all. I wonder if these feelings will stop hurting me over time if I just ignore it and pretend it doesn't exist.",

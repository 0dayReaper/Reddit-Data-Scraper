    "postText": "I might need insights here. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being dramatic or if it\u2019s valid to feel this way.\n\nMy friends and I are moving to another city for a few months to study for our licensure exam. These friends are going to be my roommates. Let\u2019s name them Bee and Cee.\n\nPrior to moving, we talked about visiting the [unfamiliar] city to find a place to live. We all agreed to go together, until a few days before our trip, Cee canceled because her boyfriend didn\u2019t allow her to go.\n\nBee and I ended up going ourselves. We managed to find a place for the 3 of us (we included Cee even though she didn\u2019t come with us). So that\u2019s one thing settled.\n\nNext, we talked about how we\u2019re gonna go with the move\u2014since we had to bring a lot of things and taking the bus would be difficult. I, myself had 1 suitcase and 2 big bags. Bee offered that we use their car (this new city was a 5-hour drive plus boat). The 3 of us agreed that we would go together during the move, and we\u2019d take Bee\u2019s car. I thought that was another issue solved.\n\nA few days later, Bee told me that she couldn\u2019t go with us during the move because she\u2019s gonna join her other friends (they\u2019ll be going to the same new city). She couldn\u2019t lend her car because they\u2019ll just be taking the bus. \nWe\u2019ll just be meeting each other at the new city. \n\nNow, I was upset. Because why would she offer to use their car if she\u2019s just gonna cancel. I had to leave other things since I\u2019ll now be taking the bus to the new city and I cant carry everything by bus. We had things planned out. We planned to go together. But I didn\u2019t tell her I was upset about it. I kept it to myself. \n\nPrior to moving, we talked about who\u2019s gonna bring what to our new place. Since the place we rented doesn\u2019t have air conditioning (I live somewhere SCORCHING HOT), our place will provide 2 fans. It\u2019s an issue because there\u2019s 3 of us. Since we\u2019re now all going by bus (because Bee canceled to use their car), we can\u2019t bring fans with us. So I offered that I\u2019d be the one to buy my own fan in the new city and they could have the 2 fans provided by our place. \n\nAnother thing we talked about was who\u2019s going to bring a printer. Since we\u2019re there for our review, a printer is a must. Out of the 3 of us, Cee had the better printer with a photocopier. I got a cartridge type (the ink is expensive and runs out fast). Considering we\u2019d be printing many review materials for the 3 of us, Cee\u2019s printer was the better option. She agreed. But ofc we\u2019d all chip in for the ink and bondpaper. \n\nNow, a few days before our trip. I reminded Cee to bring her printer. She told me she can\u2019t because she\u2019s bringing a lot of things and the printer won\u2019t fit in her bag anymore. We\u2019re staying at my house the night before our move so we can go together the next day. Plus our house is nearer to the bus terminal so I offered to let her stay in my place for the night. \n\nI told her that if she could just bring her printer here (in my house), I could fit it in my bag and I won\u2019t mind carrying it on our trip. \n\nShe then proceeded to tell me that she can\u2019t because she\u2019ll just be taking the bus all the way to my house, and it would be difficult for her to carry the printer along with her other bags. \n\nSince my mom worked near the place she lived, I told her that she can bring the printer to my mom\u2019s office (my mom will be the one to bring the printer back home, so Cee won\u2019t be carrying it on her way here), and so that I can place it in my bag ahead of time. I was already packing my things at that point. \n\nWe all would benefit from that printer. But now, she didn\u2019t reply nor view my message, but I know she read it because she\u2019s been posting and replying to our group chats, so I know she\u2019s online. Eventually, she\u2019s gonna have to message me because she\u2019s gonna spend the night before out trip here at my house, and she doesn\u2019t know the exact location of my house.\n\nI\u2019m just gonna bring my own printer. Bee and Cee won\u2019t bring theirs. Bee said we\u2019ll just have to find a printing shop in the new city, and Cee isn\u2019t replying. It may not be a big deal for them, but I know how hassling it is to have to go out all the time to have our review notes printed. We stay on the 8th floor.\n\nBut I know that they\u2019re gonna use mine once they know I brought my own printer, because we\u2019re all staying in one room. They\u2019ll see it eventually.\n\nI don\u2019t wanna be selfish, and I know I can\u2019t say no. But I don\u2019t want them using my printer. \n\nI\u2019m just upset that they both don\u2019t even care and I feel like I\u2019m the only stressing about what we need for our review.\n\nNow, I\u2019m confused if I did the right thing to offer to buy my own fan. Why should it be me when my 2 roommates don\u2019t even care about their own responsibilities? I wanted it to be fair for all of us. I don\u2019t want to be the one having to bring and sacrifice everything. I\u2019m more upset by Cee because she really didn\u2019t contribute anything to our move.",

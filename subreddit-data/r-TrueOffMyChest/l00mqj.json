    "postText": "As the title states; my (M29) girlfriend (F29) passed away 12 hours after giving birth. \n\nA blood clot had formed in her leg during pregnancy, after she had a C Section she was taken onto the ward to recover. She got up to go for a shower a few hours later and the clot travelled to her lungs.\n\nI'm in a bad place right now, I've cried everyday and there are no words to describe my emotions. The feeling of loss is indescribable, not just for me but for our son and for my partners mum and her family as well. The emotional contrast that occurred between that 12 hour period has shaken me in ways that I can't describe.\n\nThat day went from the best day of my life, our beautiful son being born with the woman I love, to the worst day of my life and all the future we had planned and prepared and talked about for so long being ripped away in some cruel, horrible and unfair turn of fate. \n\nI honestly don't know exactly why I've decided to share this experience on Reddit, I don't know if it will help, I don't know.\n\nEdit: I just wanted to say a massive thank you to every single person who has replied on this thread or DM'd me, I will try and respond to everybody as you have all wrote to me. I appreciate your advice, I receive your condolences with respect, your love and humanity have all been felt in my heart.\n\nI felt alone in grief and I realise I am not, there are so many who have had heartbreaking situations; there's no comparison of one persons grief to another I don't think they can be compared. \n\nI do think that talking and sharing the emotional burden is the only way to survive. Not just myself but for anyone affected by tragedy/emotional trauma etc.\n\nFrom the bottom of my heart thank you for allowing me to share my burden with you all, you're all amazing people.",

Symptoms of pulmonary embolism are typically chest pain, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.  A majority of blood clots start in the legs however, then travel through the venous system back up to the heart, then to the lungs to be oxygenated.  The lungs look like an upside down tree - the trunks being the major branches but the further you get from the trunk the smaller the branches become and a blood clot can easily become trapped there.  If that happens your body will not get enough oxygen and you may pass out, and in some cases serious harm or death can occur.  Symptoms of a DVT, or deep vein thrombosis, are typically swelling or pain in the leg(s) or sometimes the arm(s).  While it is not as common for DVT to occur in both legs at once, it is possible.  People who have had recent surgery or spend a long time sitting or standing without much movement are much more susceptible to developing clots.  This is the exact reason why people who have had recent surgery have compression stockings or automated sleeves around their calves to help promote blood flow.  Your calf muscles are a massive part of normal blood flow circulation and if you don\u2019t use them you put yourself at a much higher risk for venous stasis and DVT.  Also the reason why they tell you to get up and walk the aisles on long flights, or pull over and walk during long drives.",

They had put in a catheter when I initially got my epidural (standard practice), but then I didn't actually give birth until 2 days later. Well, apparently sometime in those 2 1/2 days I developed a UTI that got so bad so fast that my body went into literal shock less than 48 hours after being discharged. My aunt found me full body, teeth chattering, shivering uncontrollably while sitting in a chair trying to feed my baby, and I hadn't even realized it. She got me in her guest bed and my whole body basically seized up, so she called an ambulance. &gt;!The ER doctor said my urine was mostly blood and bacteria.!&lt;\n\nYou'd think that the nurses or doctor could have spared a second to think \"hm, this patient had something shoved up their urethra for a couple days. Maybe we should take a urine sample before they leave, just in case.\"",

At least not when the baby isn't \"truly viable\", I guess that means that they have less of a chance of making it than not. I had undiagnosed preeclampsia which ended up taking a turn to ecamplsia. It's basically toxemia. At that point, your body is generating so much protein (I believe that's what it is), that you begin to have seizures. The only way to cure eclampsia is delivery. I had about 4 seizures between my home, ambulance, and hospital. At that time, they decided to deliver my 34 week old girl. Now, most people would think that at that point, it's all good. Unfortunately, their lungs are the last thing to develop, and they're usually not ready until 37 weeks. At that point, if they tolerate intubation and the first few hours of life, they are still susceptible to a slew of complications. She had to be in a little glass box for 11 days (and that was a best case scenario). They cut me vertically (belly button to pelvis) and worked fast. I had a higher chance of survival, and they went with that. My daughter is 13 now. So they took a huge risk on the baby by delivering.",

I found out later how bad it actually was.\n\nBeing a new parent scared the shit out of me (hell it did the 2nd time around as well). Sometimes you just need someone to tell you everything is OK, you are doing it right and things are normal.\n\nI spent a lot of time with my parents. If they were not available, I would have leaned on friends. \n\nI can't imagine how you feel right now, but the little guy needs you. And he will need you to tell him about his mom so start telling him now. \n\n\nDon't be afraid to reach out for help. Both for you and for your son. Pediatrician, parents, friends, the hospital, work, support groups, use whatever you need.\n\nYou don't have to figure this out alone. \n\nCounseling may be help. My wife and her OBGYN both went to counseling (separately) after her time in the hospital. Both had PTSD, among other things, from the experience.\n\n\nYou can do this.\nWe are all rooting for you.",

Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was, and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe it\u2019s some physical thing. Maybe it\u2019s a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe it\u2019s a person who is also floating. For a while, all you can do is float. Stay alive.\n\nIn the beginning, the waves are 100 feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come 10 seconds apart and don\u2019t even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while, maybe weeks, maybe months, you\u2019ll find the waves are still 100 feet tall, but they come further apart. When they come, they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between, you can breathe, you can function. You never know what\u2019s going to trigger the grief. It might be a song, a picture, a street intersection, the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anything\u2026and the wave comes crashing. But in between waves, there is life.\n\nSomewhere down the line, and it\u2019s different for everybody, you find that the waves are only 80 feet tall. Or 50 feet tall. And while they still come, they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary, a birthday, or Christmas, or landing at O\u2019Hare. You can see it coming, for the most part, and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you, you know that somehow you will, again, come out the other side. Soaking wet, sputtering, still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage, but you\u2019ll come out. Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming, and somehow you don\u2019t really want them to. But you learn that you\u2019ll survive them. And other waves will come. And you\u2019ll survive them too. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks*\n \nThis is part of an old Reddit comment but it helped me get through losing my mum and it's very on point. I wish you a the best!",

My son seems to be in a good place mentally and I will add this at his age 13 when this happened their brain is really not prepared for grieving. I have grieved and cried and I set in my bathroom and cry so he dont hear me.\n  I talk to my hubby almost daily and it helps, I tell him about his son and whats goimg on with us. I sleep with a pillow against my back &amp; keep his picture on my phone cause I miss him. I look back on pic. and I cry but thats ok. You will find comfort in that baby and your memorys. Music helps it helps you remeber things and it will hurt and I cant say it gets easier cause its only been 10 months for me and I just started to feel like myself again. I go to sleep every night praying he visits me in my dreams.\n   I would start a scrapbook right now about her, for yourself and your baby. So when the day comes and the questions start your ready. I wish I could tell you more but this is my experience. I will say days do get better but they will be those days when theres only that one person  you want to talk to and cant.\n  Dont rush yourself and be thankful for that baby she left you with, thats what any mother would want. Ill pray for you and that baby. \ud83d\ude07",

You will soon realize a lot more people are willing to help that you never imagined.

You're maybe not ready to heal right now, but it's better to start now, take what they say to heart and when you do start to feel ready to heal you can put the techniques they give you into practice.

Plan for a guardian/guardians for your son, in case something happens to you.\n\nFigure out the best people for the job - stable, caring, willing. It may (or may not) be close relatives.

I almost left the ER bc I was impatient to get home to my son. he was only a few days old. the pain my husband and I endured during this time was immense. but certainly not like yours. I was lucky. I am sorry for your loss. know your wife was a warrior, and she looks down on you and the babe w love everyday. I certainly do and im still here by the grace of God.",

            "comment": "It's been said in some comments already that it's important to remember her for your child.  Write down/journal as much as you can now about her.  It's inevitable that memories fade with time, and anytime a fleeting memory crosses your mind, try to jot it down.  It may be cathartic for you as part of your grieving process too.  \n\nAlso, BACK UP ANY AND ALL PHOTOS you have of her, with her, etc.",

            "comment": "As a pregnant woman who will be giving birth via section, this is my worst fear!  I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.  Grieve and take your time to get through the pain, process it but don\u2019t forget that she lives on in your memories and your son.  I\u2019d hope that my husband would keep my memory alive and remind himself and our boys how much I loved them all.  I think she would want you to know that too.  \n\nWrite down everything you can remember about her now so time doesn\u2019t whittle it all away.  Maybe also ask your wife\u2019s family to do the same so you all can collectively create a more complete memory for your son later.  \n\nTake care of yourself and make sure to ask for help when you need it!",

Dont be affraid too show youre emotions, cry if you have too, let every emotion and feeling come over you, dont fight it. A psychologist told me this when i was in a dark place. I wish i could do more for you. I wish you all the best and for you're son. Maybe counseling can make a difference, even if its little. Keep ventilating youre feelings and thoughts.",

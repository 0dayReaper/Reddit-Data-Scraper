    "postText": "Never wear makeup in my entire 29 years life, so after a while, at least once, I want to try it out. Went to Watson, asked the lady to help me choose the foundation and everything. We had a test try to see what's the best for me, (due to my laziness), we opt to air flash foundation and matte finish look powder.  \n\n\nThat't it. I put nothing else on my face. And I feel so beautiful.  \n\n\nI decided to send few selfies to bf, asked what he think of it. He(nicely) said 'why it is lighter than your skin colour and to never wear it again', along with 'I don't like you earring choice but go along with it cause it's your hobby'. I wear only mini hoop or stud earrings.  \n\n\nNow I feel so ugly.",

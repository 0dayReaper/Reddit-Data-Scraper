    "postText": "My boyfriend has just started streaming and he seems pretty excited about it. He didn\u2019t buy a whole set up yet but live streams whenever he is on. I streamed briefly and know how hard it is to get viewers. I open multiple private browsers on my personal laptop, work laptop and phone - this way I can have his stream going and it counts as multiple viewers. When he saw 4, he was stoked. It\u2019s only 4 viewers but he was so happy. There\u2019s very little in this world right now that can cause that genuine happiness and expression. I sit on the other side of the couch with the volume down on all devices and just pretend I\u2019m doing school work.\n\nEDIT: wow! I appreciate the kind comments. I haven\u2019t shared his link because the purpose of this post was to get something off my chest and not \u201cfarm subs\u201d. I believe he is capable of it on his own, it\u2019s just to keep him motivated and I have already shared with friends/family. I also don\u2019t want him to find out. He plays Warzone/vanguard, perhaps you\u2019ll come across his stream in the future. He streams on twitch. I give him 4 viewers not 1,000. \n\nThis is something I\u2019ve literally done for the last 2 weeks, do not tell me I have copied and pasted- I have no reason. Also, thank you for the awards! I\u2019m fairly new to Reddit and I enjoy this community.",

Now you may be thinking I'm fine, that's kinda lame, why would I do that? But the 3 free viewers already puts you above the thousands behind that small 0-1 viewer barrier that can make you much much harder to find. Just a tip to help you out",

I'd tear the corner, crumple them up in a ball as much as I could and just do everything I could to make the note look old and tatty. \n\n\n\nIf I'd give that fiver as change I would almost always get it back as a tip.

You're kind of inhibiting his growth as an entertainer by doing this.\n\nIt comes from a good place, I get it. But if he's shit he needs to know he's shit so he can improve.

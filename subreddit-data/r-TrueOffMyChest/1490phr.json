    "postText": "Basically the title. I\u2019ve been a little obsessed with hot chocolate for the last few months and been drinking it like crazy. As a result I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at making some high grade ~~crack~~ hot chocolate. Very addictive to say the least.   \nI also happen to occasionally enjoy black teas in the morning. I don\u2019t often indulge in it as I already suffer from insomnia but some mornings I can\u2019t help myself.   \nI woke up rather early this morning (early enough to be tired, but not quite early enough to go back to sleep again) and had some time on my hands. I was tired and kind of craving something sweet (and preferably chocolate based) when the idea struck me.  \nI brought some milk to a boil and added my black tea blend. Once the two minutes had passed I removed the teabag and added the chocolate, marshmallows and cocoa powder and\u2026 why in the *fuck* is it so good?   \nIt\u2019s just a *little* more bitter than normal and if I wanted to avoid that I\u2019d just replace the dark chocolate. The milk-tea was a nice caramel color once it had steeped (before adding the chocolate) and the taste was definitely different so I know it worked, but why does it taste this good? Why did I not know about this? Has no one tried this before? How the fuck am I ever supposed to drink anything else in the morning? The black tea I used isn\u2019t even a blend that\u2019s supposed to taste particularly good with milk! It\u2019s meant for drinking it with *lemon juice*!\n\nNow I just want to spend hours experimenting and brewing chocolate-tea, how the hell am I even supposed to deal with this revelation? Can I turn this into ice? How many liters will I be able to drink before I have to vomit? Does the caffeine content remain the same? So many questions and I\u2019ve got the feeling I\u2019ll be forced to learn more than a few answers thanks to my curiosity.",

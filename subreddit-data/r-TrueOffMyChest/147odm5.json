    "postText": "Hi to all who's gonna read my update and again apologize in advance if there is any wrong grammar or spelling cause english is not my main language.\n\nFor some context my ex gf and i known each other since i was 15 and she was 11 .. our fathers we're bestfriend at that time , and we became in a relationship when i'm 19 and she's 15 .. we both love each other even in such a young age.We had intercourse in the 1st year of our relationship,. She's the one who engage at me and i just go on with that flow . It's kinda embarrasing i mean you are man .. man should make the first move and yet she's the one that did that. We had intercourse everyweek after that in a hotel .. We cant do that in both of our houses cause our parents at that time will definitely get mad . But they are aware of our relationship and they were so happy for us . Her father even give me his blessing in advance .. He says his daughter is in goodhands .. ,I was so happy at that moment,knowing our parents acknowledge our relationship that in their eyes we're legal.\nFast forward .. 3rd year of our relationship ..\nI was already working in our town local government office .. and at that time she was 18 .. and attending college she had so many hobbies , She a member of the volleyball team, member of the brassband etc. I was so proud of her.., April 18, 2017, i pick her up at her house and drop her at school as usual .(i'm using my dad's old honda civic) what . I dont have a car yet .\nShe said goodbye with a long kiss. And i've gone to work . That day after work i tried to call her cause she's not replying on texts and i can't reach her phone through call. I came to her university to pick her up cause i know her class ends after my work .\nBut to avail she's not there . I learn form her classmates that her dad excuse her from the class.\nMy heart was racing at this point . I immediately drove to their house but no was there . The house was already abandoned . I sat at the gutter of the driveway hoping they'll return.in my mind maybe their just having dinner or going out at the park .I don't know how many hours had past.. until my dads truck park in the other side of the road . Both my parents immediately run for me and hugged me..I cried while hugging them too . My older sister (27 at that time) run to me and hugged me too .My whole family was there,trying to comfort me,. I was not saying anything i was just like a body that has no soul . When we got home .. i just lock myself in my room .. crying non-stop until i fell asleep .. in that morning my dad called my work and told them that i was not feeling well . My dad then called my godfather who's actually our towns mayor . When my godfather knew of my situation he instantly called our pastor who's a therapist for I.C and M.C .. I resigned from work .. knowing to myself that im emotionally compromised .( Yes.i borrowed that from star trek) and will just be a liability in work . 1st year of therapy and i must say i feel a lot better. But i'm still in the house not going outside., This go on for months.. well i have a pc and console to occupy my time and to keep my mind from not thinking of the pain.and eventually i became a lot better even thinking of that pain has now minimal effect on me through out the years . Fast forward on the present .. met ex gf accidentally in a restaurant .. i don't know what came over me but the pain from 6 years ago came back . I rush out the restaurant and went crying to my apartment then she called me and ask to meet up .\nThis was 2 days ago i was the one who set up when and where .. as i approach the meeting place she was already there , but its still 20min early . The place is actually a beach side park we're supposed to meet by 6:30 .. its just 6:10 and she's already here .. she's excited i guess. Guys i don't know what came over me again but i bought an extra helmet .. dammit .. am i expecting too much .. sh**t \nI know she doesn't have a car .. so i just think i wanna be the one to make sure she gets home safely . As i aproach to where she sits i .. she instantly notice me \nAnd she stands up and runs to hug me . As much as i know i want to hug her too .. we hugged each other in silent,for while and she's the one to brake the silence .. \"i missed you so much,i'm so sorry for everything\" \nIn my mind i wanna say .. I hate you , you left me broken and alone ..why .. but i didn't i just replied to her \"i miss you too\" i hug her even tighter .. and after that we sat there .. i was silent again and she break the silence again :\" your motorcycle kinda big for someone as thin as you \" \ud83e\udd14 : me : ahmm . Yeah i get that a lot my ride is about 185kg in weight and i'm just 65kg \" her: you haven't change .. answering questions in detailed manner .:me: aaaahhh . I never thought of that .. anyway wanna grab something i'm really hungry .. guys .. i don't know whats happening but the first time again we see each other in years we instantly hit it off again . I thought i was going to be mad .. asking question but that didn't came to my mind .. i was happy that i'm with her right now .we ate barbecues , street food etc . We walk around the beach . And after that we went into my apartment .. we watch netflix while grabbing some drinks ... I told her just get some food on the fridge ..before i could stand up .. she kissed me .. and i just close my eyes and let it all happen ..and you guess it we end up in bed .. very slow and passionate intercourse .. after we finish we just stared at each other and fell asleep. In the morning i was the one who got up early . i cook us breakfast .. and after that i went into the shower .. as i was washing my hair with water , she pressed her chest on my back and grab my manhood and she  engaged me again and we did it in the bathroom ..after that in the kitchen when were eating she ask me if i was mad. I told her . I dunno know, and smile .., i even said .. you're here now thats what matters . She stares at me . I think shes getting ready to attack me again . She cried and she said \" i wanted to contact you for the last 6 years .. i really wanted to .. but dad force me not too .. he said if i contacted you i'll be out on the streets . I hated my parent for what they did .. me : i wanted to contact you too . But i thought, you have a new life so i didn't continue . Her: for 6 years i have never forgotten about .. there isn't a day that i never thought of you .. I love you .. and i will always will . Me : i love you too . I have always love you . I never dated anyone else hoping this day would come . Her : (cried) holds my hand .. 3 weeks after we left i found out i was pregnant . But due to emotional stressed i had a miscarriage .. i'm sorry , i'm sorry , i'm sorry . I held her to my chest and cried with her .. knowing i was going to have a child and lost it . She held my face and said .. can we go back to our home town ,my parents will explain everything to you ., Your moms birthday is coming this week i know you'd be there .\nMe: yeah i'll be riding back this wednesday morning .. if you'd want you can ride a long with me ..?\nHer: i would love too ..( proceed to hug me again ) and we cuddled to the couch ..",

            "comment": "INFO: What was even the reason, why her father suddenly moved away. Its written that she found out, that shes pregnant after she moved away - so this cant be the reason. You said that your fathers were best friends. Didnt you father ever wonder why and how his best friend left suddenly? You dont abandon a house in 5 minutes, you need to move stuff and you need to sell it (or do something with it). Did your father not get any information about the situation? All in all a lot of question marks. Im not in your situation, but it would be stupid to not be cautious. You are a very emotional target, so someone could easily take advantage of you.",

    "postText": "I know this is bad timing with Father\u2019s Day coming up but I have to get this off my chest. I hate my dad. For background, my dad is an immigrant. Growing up, he would miss my games and important events to work. I understand sometimes you have to miss a soccer game or a school play but he would never show up at all. In middle school I started growing facial hair. Where im from, people grow facial hair faster and generally have more. Other kids fathers were teaching them how to shave around eighth grade. My father never did. He didn\u2019t even buy me a razor. I was too embarrassed to ask him to teach me because I assumed he would teach me one day. He never did. One day I realized I looked like a pedo with my scrappy beard so I bought my own razor and watched a YouTube video. My dad did not teach me how to drive or how to change a flat. My father has always provided for me and my family and we live extremely comfortably. He got me a car at 16 and payed for my college and all my expenses and everything I wanted but that doesn\u2019t change the fact he never gave me the experiences that other kids had and we never developed the bond that we should have had.",

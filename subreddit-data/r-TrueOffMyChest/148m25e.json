    "postText": "A friend of mine asked me to lend them money to cover hospital bills of their family member (not America, so the cost isn't massively significant). I did so without any question as I know how much their family member means to them. However, I have since been stressing that I may not get the money back (even though there's nothing to suggest I won't get it back). I've stressed so much that I've triggered migraine and aphasia (difficulty to articulate and communicate what I want to say). I'm sleep deprived and slowly slipping into the grips of anxiety. I've got a job interview this week and I can't remember anything. I'm going to embarass myself and cost myself a huge opportunity to progress in my field. I wish I didn't help my friend, it's really destroyed me.",

    "postText": "Hey I\u2019m a (25M) male who ended up being homeless two months ago. I am currently living in my college teacher (45F) garage for the past two months, and now I\u2019m looking to move out this month and was wondering if anyone on here was also looking for a roommate. A little bit about myself\u2026 I\u2019m a 6\u201910ft introverted type of guy with a clean record and I like being by myself most of the time so me being in your personal pace wouldn\u2019t be a problem whatsoever. I\u2019m not in a hurry to leave my teacher garage but at the same time I don\u2019t want to overstay my welcome. If anyone here is down please shoot me a DM so we could get to know each and discuss further. I would prefer my roommate being a woman but if it comes to down to be the same sex I wouldn\u2019t mind it.",

Obviously exaggerating but i wouldnt care much if the entire continent sank into the ocean, and i certainly dont care if some very questionable individual that noone outside of the US ever heard of said even more questionable stuff on Twitter for the 100th time. Tucker Carlson, Bill Burr, Mitch  Mcconnel and whatnot, i hate the fact that i even know these names because i have been spammed into oblivion by this website with this spam.",

Just to see if it was my imagination I posted a link to a story about Trump's uncharacteristically appropriate and even polite response to learning of Ruth Bader Ginsburg's passing. I did make the mistake of not directly quoting the title of the article and got a bot-alert to make the edit (not the first time that happened, I'm bad about not reading the rules), but before I could I was hammered with scathing comments basically accusing me of being Hitler and Pol Pot's ass-baby. Then I immediately got a message banning me *FOR LIFE* from the sub, apparently I was trolling or something. All I did was have the gall to post a link that wasn't virulently anti-Trump.\n\nI'm *far* from a Trump supporter, but since this was such an unusual (and widely ignored) event I thought it would be interesting to share. Oh well...",

Bunch of 17 year olds who can\u2019t even vote yet, much less form and opinion they weren\u2019t taught. \n\nAnd, Let\u2019s be real honest here as well, 100,000 upvotes for trump breathing? Yeah, that wasn\u2019t paid for... bots didn\u2019t skyrocket that post to the top... nope. No siree. \n\n\nA lot of what the front page is, without filters is straight up paid content. People who pretend that the Democrats don\u2019t election meddle are blind as all get out. Reddit tried to claim they don\u2019t let people buy upvotes- doesn\u2019t matter. People make accounts, people see accounts, people buy upvotes, it\u2019s not rocket science.",

This ensures that the private broadcast media outlets that aim for profit can keep pumping out their sensationalized headlines, but without getting in the way of the informative &amp; neutral public broadcasting.\n\nSource: Communications Studies undergrad (or common sense, really)",

            "comment": "The straight, explicit answer is that suicide is the wrong answer to every question. People will tell you things will get better but that isn't right. Life is hard. There will always be another problem to solve, another heartache that needs healing, and without those things you wouldn't know what it meant to be alive.\n\nAs someone who's gone through a lot of shit: talk to a therapist. They won't help you, not really, but by choosing to go to a therapist you will take control of your own future. You need to prove to yourself that the world isn't going to win over you. Don't let the world win.",

When in doubt try helping others who need it. It'll bring you joy I promise.\n\nYou need rebirth. Like a phoenix\nMy recipe.\n\nWhat you need my friend is a few hits of acid, an empty room. Get the acid, clear your schedule. Make sure the environment is clean, get drinks. Make sure you won't be interrupted for the next 12 to 24 hours. A few joints would be nice to have too.  Sit down meditate and smile. Even if you don't mean it at first. Watch a cartoon named chowder while you wait for the acid to kick in. when it's all over you'll be better. Don't take more than 2 hits your first time. Have binaural beats music playing in the background or one of the many 8 hour lucid dreaming videos from YouTube. \nYou'll be a new person when you come out of the trip. Find your bliss and hold on to it. \n\nIf your schizophrenic you probably shouldn't take acid. Just saying.\n\nI hope you get through this.\n\nAlso another remedy to the sadness. \"Oh the places you will go\" by dr. Seuss\nRead it, it'll help I promise.",

    "postText": "He offered to give her his email address and said he would send her pics and she agreed. It always makes me bitter how much of an advantage teenage boys have with women, so I took a screenshot. I talked to the cam model, did a private show with her then gave her my phone number in a private message, telling her to text me. She responds that she lost her phone. So I ask her if she has email. She says something about having gotten rid of it when she lost her phone(language barrier, she's Colombian). I fake jokingly said but didn't you agree to email that young boy. Didn't understand whatever bullshit she gave me after that. \n\nAnyways I am wondering what I should do with this now. I'm not really interested in \"justice\" or anything like that so I wouldn't report her to the authorities. But I am considering blackmailing her or just further questioning her about what a 16 year old boy has that I don't, under the threat of reporting her if she doesn't agree to talk. Yeah I know I'm fucked up lol. This isn't even the first time I've done this. I pretended to be a 13 year old boy on Omegle and had a sexual chat with a 22 year old girl and I have that whole thing saved as well. Never did anything with it though.",

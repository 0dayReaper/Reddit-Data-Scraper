    "postText": " I (20m) managed to get a beautiful, gorgeous loving, understanding, hot, nerdy, ... Girlfriend about 6 months ago. Weve been togetger since and the relationship gets stronger day by day. She's everything u dreamed of, i can't even believe a person like her can exist so perfectly. \n\n And with all that, i feel like I don't appreciate her enough. I get everything all of a sudden, and i feel im just wasting it and I can't even describe how. I love her, i make her feel loved all the time and she's happy, I've been there for her all the time. And i still feel likei don't appreciate all this love and understanding the right way. Like im missing out or something. \n\n Don't get me wrong, I don't wanna be cocky but i never treated her wrong, i respected and loved her all the way, never disrespected her and she approves that. She says all the time that im perfect even!\n\n I don't know if it's all in my head and I'm overthinking it. Or maybe it's because I thought i could be unlimitedly happy when i have a person like this which is still hard to believe i do, and i had dreamy expectations about how I'd feel. I don't know what's wrong with me :D",

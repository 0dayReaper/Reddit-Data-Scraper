Business started slowing down so 5 went down to 4. 4 isn't bad since every station is still covered it just got annoying if people needed to take breaks. Then when covid hit 4 dropped down to 3, which was pretty easy at the start but we kept getting busier and busier and my boss wouldn't change the schedule to accommodate. So on some weekend days we have 3 people running the store, and only 2 people while others are taking breaks. If we start seeing any kind of rush in the dining room and the drive through it becomes hell so fast. Idk if you've ever played webkinz but i feel like I'm playing pizza palace running all over the store having to make every second count. \ud83e\udd23\n\nIt doesn't help that our kitchen is separated from the dining room by a counter so the customers just stand there and watch me get my ass kicked and STILL act like I need to be right there ready to take their order as soon as they walk in.",

I explain to her what happened and I give her the receipt that showed the original payment but since the order still needed to be paid for by the next car I had to leave the check open so no reciept showing the refund was printed. \n\nI try to explain this to her but immediately she gets angry with me demanding a receipt showing her refund and no matter how many times I try to explain it to her she just won't take no for an answer. Next I try to print out the ticket thats not paid for, and ask for her reciept back, so I can show her that on the original one you can see the time the order was charged vs the time on the open order that was still pending payment. I assure her that if her refund isn't posted by the next day, then she can come back or call us and we can sort it out. \n\nEven after this 10 minute \"argument\" she still won't understand what I'm trying to tell her and keeps saying things like \"im not stupid I know how to tell the time on the receipts\" so by this point I take a nice long pause and take a deep breath and I say \"look, I'm just trying to help you. Why are you taking this out on me? Your money is not going to me, I WANT you to get your refund. If it doesn't go through I'm your witness and I will vouch for you.\" And then finally it seems like she just snaps out of her tantrum and I write my name down on her receipt and she leaves. Took me a solid couple minutes to cool down after that. \n\nI have COUNTLESS stories of customers from hell and I honestly feel so bad for fast food workers everywhere. Dealing with these people 5+ days a week gets so mentally exhausting i still don't even know why i continue to work at this place.",

So they could be very good just with the wrong sounds lol",

Had to circle around and get a new one. No big deal, but missing buns is just so... weird.\n\n2) Had a piece of chicken wind up in my curly fries. It was night time and dark so I didn't notice until I bit into it.. I'm allergic to poultry. This lead to a 4-ish hour restroom break at work with liquid nasty flowing from both ends. Didn't complain, it was an honest mistake.. but people should definitely be aware of allergies being a thing and use that as incentive to get orders correct.",

I only notice the very seldom ones when they mess up an item or something. And, because I'm hungry, I'm rally cranky. It took me about a year to realize how stupid it is for me to get angry when they almost always get it right, because with just a couple of clicks I can have whatever food I feel like delivered to my door in about an hour. The estimate also bothers me [alot](https://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html). The website says 60 minutes and, because I'm stupid and only order when I'm already hungry, I start to get pissed at minute 61. One day they were 2 hours late (3 since I ordered) and that I should be thankful just for eating that day with a few clicks. I mean, the grocery store is like 2 minutes away from me, but I'd still rather click and then get pissed when they're 1 minute late... Sheesh... Some people (me)...",

They need the stock market to continue its artificial bull run for eternity. The stock market is their paycheck, they sit on massive stacks of inherited cash and they let it work for them.\n\nOnce you hit a certain amount of wealth, your money becomes much more productive than you'll ever be. And when this continues for a generation or two, where their kids are completely unproductive and still completely flooded with cash, they lose sight of what money actually represents. Money represents labor, generated by a person who is working. People who skim off the top of that labor don't do any work, and most of the wealthy we've got who are funding political campaigns, they don't really know how to work. They can't generate wealth on their own, they can only skim it from someone who is actually working. When the economy is roaring and everyone around has money to spend, investment pays off well. When everyone is trying to stop a virus from spreading and killing tens of millions of people, investments aren't all that great (with the exception of printer goes brrrrrr)\n\nWhen the working poor become the non-working poor, the wealthy starts getting smaller paychecks. The stock market starts to decline, their investments with completely inherited funds stop returning 15% per year. They get nervous.\n\nThey don't need dishwashers to wash their own dishes, they need normal, middle class Americans to go to restaurants *and pay for dinner* so that their investments can kick out their usual dole.\n\nWhen the only indicator that politicians use is the stock market, they're pretty much a stand-in for the investing class, because that's all that matters to them.",

This was done from panic and from a lack of proper training in handling such an outrageously rare aviation event. \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nDo we all go around saying that pilots don\u2019t deserve to be paid a living wage because some pilot errors lead to mass tragedy? Do we say that engineers deserve only $7.25 an hour because they make a plane that had a faulty system? \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\n**NO.**\n\nWe retrain the pilots, rebuilt the planes, and heavily analyze crash data so we can make the world a safer place. Then we endure an uncomfortably cozy fifteen minutes with TSA before getting on our flights. \n\n&amp;nbsp; \n\nIf we can forgive the professions that actually kill with a living wage, we can forgive a wrong order at McDonalds with a living wage.

Typically people in white collar office jobs make EXPENSIVE mistakes with much more negligence than fast food workers. Fast food workers are in physically demanding jobs, and the chances of making a mistake are higher just do to sheer number of things they have to do quickly. White collar mistakes are usually not some spur of the moment thing, they're failures of a system or chronic negligence. I'm talking even honest normal office workers. I met a really experienced and competent woman from our Benefits dept at work and within 10 mins of meeting her told me that she once made a million dollar mistake in her current job. I wonder what the ratio of avg mistake to average revenue per employee is like between fast food workers and higher paying jobs.",

That is what you should expect to make while working there. People need to understand that you get paid based on your skills and how replaceable you are. Literally almost anybody can go and get a job at a fast-food place. Now let's compare that to an EMT who makes about $15ish an hour. You cannot just go and get a job as an EMT like you can at a fast food place, people need to learn the difference.\n\nIf you expect to make more than 11 12 or $13 an hour at a fast food place, I would not hold your breath. It's based in part of replaceability and the same goes for other types of jobs. You're not entitled to make $15 an hour just because you work.\n\n It wasn't that long ago when those jobs paid $8.50 an hour and then people said it should be 11 or $12 an hour. Do we not see the pattern? I remember many said they should make 11 or 12 bucks an hour. Now that we are there everybody says they should make 15.",

So of course the goalposts would move forward regarding what people would like to see a new minimum wage set to. It's not some slippery slope, this is an intentional response to the economics at work.\n\n&gt;Do we not see the pattern?\n\nI think it would be easy to ask the same question to anyone arguing against incremental gains in wages. Moreover, we are certainly not \"there\" regarding everyone making \"11 or 12 bucks an hour\" given that federal minimum wage is still $7.25. \n\nMaking this wage puts a full time worker below the poverty line, moreover, the majority of employees making these wages are adults, not teens trying to make extra scratch. So the belief that this wage should be reserved for simple replaceable jobs doesn't reflect the reality of what many people today are actually paid.\n\nIt's okay to disagree on what jobs *should* be paid a minimum vs which ones deserve a premium, but since employers fail to care about this distinction and continue paying skilled, trained, and well-educated workers the minimum set by law, this is why so many people feel strongly that the only solution is to raise the pay floor for everyone, regardless of their line of work.\n\nAnd the last point, yes, EMTs should be paid more, everyone should. And this is in essence what people are arguing in support for. Which leads to a related issue: even if we raised everyone's income to match inflation, it still wouldn't match the current cost of living in the US as this has substantially outpaced this inflation. It's why even couples with dual incomes find themselves needing to move back in with their parents.\n\nPeople arguing against you don't necessarily disagree with the majority of your views, they are just trying to combat the worsening economic health of the working class and a large portion of Americans overall.",

This keeps spots open for new kids who want to better themselves.\n\nThis, of course, falls apart when the entry level positions get log jammed with people holding out for retirement or government handouts, or social welfare programs, or affirmative action opportunities... basically anything that doesn't involve effort on their part.   You're not supposed to be a CSR and trying to support a family.

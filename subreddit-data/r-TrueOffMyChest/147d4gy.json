    "postText": "This has been eating away at me for literal years, probably ever since I moved out at 17 and I'm 24(F) now. I can't handle it anymore it's gotten worse and it's physically keeping me up at night and making me nauseous. I want to make it right to her but the only way I can think is by paying her back but I'm not exactly financially thriving. Maybe this is my punishment. I'm not looking for anyone to be on my side, I don't really see how you can be lol, but I just wanted to get this \"off my chest\"\n\nI want to start off my saying I am fully aware that I was spoiled. I hate myself for how I felt entitled to everything. My mom gave me almost everything I ever wanted. Toys, games, we even moved to a city that I chose because she asked which one I preferred. My mom treasured me. When I was in middle school my mom had a drastic job change. She got a new job doing something she was much more passionate about but it made significantly less money. She's never had a partner (I'm adopted and she made herself a promise to put me first, not her romantic life) so she was the sole provider for us. Before her job change I would say she made pretty good money. We would always have extra money for fun things like video games or going out but when she switched her job all of that changed. She started saving money and we weren't able to go out as much and I wasn't able to get the things I wanted.\n\nEventually she started saving up money so we could go on our annual camping trips again like we used to before she changed jobs. It was something she always looked forward to, and I also looked forward to it too so it's beyond me why I did this to her. One day I asked her if I could get my favorite cookies from the store down the street and she told me no, that we didn't have enough money because she hadn't gotten paid yet. I threw a tantrum and when she left to take the dog for a walk I snuck into her room and stole $10 out of the jar so I could get cookies. She didn't hide the jar and it wasn't hard to open it was so simple for me to just grab what I needed. I meant for it to be a one time thing but eventually I started grabbing money out of it almost every day so I could buy things that I wanted. If I'm being honest all of the money that I took over the years is probably close to $5000. And we never were able to take our camping trip again. My last camping trip was with her in middle school.\n\nWHEN I WAS 15 MY MOM HAD CANCER AND I CONTINUED TO STEAL FROM HER. SHE WAS BEDRIDDEN AND SO SICK AND I SNUCK IN AT NIGHT TO STEAL MONEY FROM HER. WHY DID I DO THAT?? \n\nMy mom has sacrificed so much for me and the second she got a job for herself that she enjoyed, I made our lives harder. I'm having a hard time living with myself. We are still close and she calls me everyday to see how I'm doing. I want to tell her it's my fault or more importantly I want to pay her back but I'm barely making it by as it is. The thing is she is constantly asking me if I need help with rent or if I need help with food and I turn her down each time even though I do... I don't deserve her help.",

            "comment": "If you're an only child, there's no way she doesn't know you stole the money. That's the reason she is asking if you still need help- in her mind she thinks you took it because you really needed it. \n\nIf she knew you stole it because you were selfish I don't know if she would love you any less, but understand you not only stole money from her you stole memories and trips that meant a great deal that she can never get back. \n\nYou were a kid, doing stupid kid things, but make no mistake you're still a bad person for doing it and lying about it all these years. She didn't have to put you ahead of her own life, you weren't her blood, but she did anyway because she truly loves you unconditionally. \n\nAnd even as she was sick with cancer you still stole from her. I would see that as a completely unforgivable choice. I had a family member cost me 30k and I haven't spoken to them since. \n\nYou need to do better. Tell her the truth. You won't fix things, it won't make you a better person, and it won't make you feel better. But it's the right thing to do. She deserves at least that much after the sacrifices she made to care for you. \n\nYou are truly lucky to have had someone who loved you that much. Some people get biological parents that couldn't give two shits about them. You'll never be able to put things right. But you can start on the path towards honesty and the truth. \n\nShe may forgive you, she may not. You did betray her love and trust for extremely selfish reasons. That's the true potential punishment and cost of your theft.",

                    "comment": "I've come close to telling her the truth so many times over so many phone calls and it sends me into a panic attack every time. The jar that she used to save money was specifically made for saving money, the lid had a slot where you could put money in and it would scan the size of the coin or the bill and add up what you put in there. There's no way the number would have matched up whenever she counted up her savings. I think I'm more scared that she already knows and has continued to treat me no differently. She is the nicest person I know and I don't say that just because she's family. Her job is suicide prevention for the youth. She only knows how to care for people and she hardly puts time aside for herself. \n\nTomorrow I'm just going to tell her. And I'm going to honest that it was all for selfish reasons. And I'm going to tell her I did it while she was sick. If she doesn't forgive me I've come to terms that I really don't deserve it anyway. I'm just scared.",

It's been 3 years since we last talked, after she hurt me and put me in serious financial ruin. Let me tell you one thing.\n\nI dont believe I'll ever forgive her. But I'll never know if I can because she's made no effort to reach out or make it right. She's blocked me every time I've tried to reach out for her to own up to her shitty behavior. She hasn't. But I know it would be a great relief if she even made the slightest effort to apologize for what she did. It would be weight off me. \n\nShe'd still be dead to me for all intents and purposes, but at least it would show me she has some humanity left inside her cold dead heart. \n\nFor you, maybe she'll forgive. I do hope you apologize. I do hope you tell her the truth. Someone who spends their life putting others before themselves deserves honestly and the whole truth.",

    "postText": "Back in March, my ex of 3 years dumped me. Instead of feeling bad about it  (because I knew something was up), I went back out on the dating scene and met some pretty cool people on some dating apps. \n\nOne of those guys we will call Jay. Jay and I got along immediately, we liked the same stuff, had the same music taste and our humor was basically the same. So we started dating after a bit of talking (Probably not the best Idea) \n\nWell there was also another option in the dating pool and that was my friend/coworker M. Everyone thought we would be cute together, and I had a crush on him already before I started dating Jay, that I thought would disappear after getting into a relationship. It never did and I felt bad that I was having these feelings while with Jay, so I broke up with him and told him maybe we could try again in the future. \n\nI haven\u2019t told Jay, the other reason I broke up with him, and I don\u2019t really plan to, to spare his feelings. I just felt like a bad person to have a crush on someone else while in the relationship. Does this make me a bad guy? We didn\u2019t date for long so It wasn\u2019t like, \u201cserious\u201d yet",

    "postText": "soo a little back story, i\u2019ve known D for like 4 years, he was basically just a mutual when we first started hanging out, never really talked to each other but we did have each others social media\u2019s. Anyways 6 months ago and i decided to reach out more and asked to hang out and it worked out great because we see and talk to each other quiet a bit over the past few months. Let me list off some of the cute things\n-kisses me goodbye when i leave \n-orders my uber ride back every time \n-confides in me about some personal things \n-tells me to stay safe when i go out clubbing and to get home safe \n-on valentine\u2019s day, he asked if he went for a walk and smoked a joint if i\u2019d wanna come (first and last time he asked something like that PLUS it was freezing outside it was like 9pm) and we kissed under a street light with the snow falling like whattttt???? It was the most romantic shit ever \nHe\u2019s just the sweetest but here\u2019s where i\u2019m stumped. We talked about a relationship and at first he wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to look for anything but he did like me. Cool. Don\u2019t worry I didn\u2019t wait around i tried talking to other people but then i asked him again since it had been a couple months. I just wanted to check to see where he stood and he said he thinks he\u2019s close to wanting something but he doesn\u2019t know how much he has to offer because of school and work. Totally understandable. I guess what i\u2019m trying to say is that i don\u2019t wanna push a relationship on him, but I like him a lot and I\u2019m just not too sure how long i should be secretly hoping he\u2019s going to ask me out. Like I said i really don\u2019t want to rush him into anythingI just don\u2019t want to wait around too long.",

            "comment": "Sorry but sounds like he\u2019s stringing you along. Like what do you mean he\u2019s close to wanting something. You either do or you don\u2019t it\u2019s not a guessing show. \n\nI think you should just focus on yourself and continue seeing others etc because you\u2019re just going to end up hurt waiting for someone who is not emotionally available or doesn\u2019t want to be in a relationship and also doesn\u2019t want to lose the option of an relationship. \u270c\ufe0f",

That\u2019ll either cause him to jump in out jump out. I know you like him, but you are 19: odds are you won\u2019t stay. That doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t learn about yourself and enjoy your time together. Hope this helps, good luck!",

    "postText": "From middle school starting in class 6 I shifted to a new school and had no friends but was desperate to have many. By class 7 I started doing well in my studies and used to complete all school work like classwork and homework unlike the majority of the class. These children started asking help in studies and I was the happiest person then and made around 20 friends in few months ! The same story was till class 10 until I didnt study and failed my examinations . To my suprise instead of sympathizing with me these boys started taunting and teasing me for my failure and said how they were superior to me as they didnt fail. I was really sad , when I needed them the most all of these backbenchers backstabbed me. They still laugh at me . I am here with literally no friends anymore , I had many but turns out they were just homework takers and not friends. Has something similar happened to you? How do I become more brave?",

    "postText": "I (f40) have been in a relationship with my now husband (m42) for 4 years. He is gorgeous and super fit. I worked out that he was anorexic/body dysmorphic with OCD tendancies, and that this was due to a past trauma within the first few months. \n\nI slowly worked with him on opening up and through love, support and non judgement he realised for himself that all the issues named above are due to a serious SA as a child.\n\nWe worked on his eating and he felt comfortable eating if I was and so I would give him more and more food each meal to build him up to eating a standard size food intake for his build and activity levels. He has a very physical job and works out at the gym daily. So needed lots of calories to sustain. However, to get him to eat the food he should meant that I had to eat the same volume to encourage him. I even had to maintain his speed of eating too because if I finished first then he would stop despite him not being full. He is now aware, and mindful of his choices and knows that when I see him spiral I will pull him back around and get him back on track. This is not something I have to do often now which makes for massive improvement on his part. He has been working through his trauma and is all round in a much happier, healthier place and I couldn't be more proud of him.\n\nWhile getting him healthy (mind and body) my weight has ballooned, I have gone up 20Kg. I am so fat that I struggle with exercise, struggle to breathe properly when I'm sleeping and now snore so bad that my husband can't sleep beside me.\n\nMy husband loves me and doesn't care that he sleeps on the sofa most nights but I do, I hate my body, I hate that when I wake in the morning he isn't there to snuggle up to.\n\nI am now trying to work out daily doing 15 minute hiits, working out with hubby in the garden with his weights, walking at least 2 miles a day and I am keeping myself in calorie deficit by not eating through the day and only eating one meal at tea time with hubby. Been doing this now for 3 weeks yet the weight just isn't shifting. I hate it, I hate myself for letting myself get this bad. \n\nI weigh more than my body builder husband who is taller than me...and that was shocking to me.\n\nI've never been small, but when we met I was under 75Kg (still overweight for my height but I was comfortable at this) and now I'm massive.\n\nI'm going to keep doing what I'm doing and hope that the weight starts coming off soon. But even if it doesn't I will be fitter for it.\n\nI can't vent this to my husband as I don't want to trigger him into poor eating habits again or him blaming himself for me being so huge (he genuinely doesn't see it...how I do not know but he sees me for the person I am and not the vessel I come in) so that's why I'm venting here. \n\nHopefully, in a few months I will be able to come back and say I've lost a few Kg and I am on the path to a healthier me...wish me luck",

Keep the habits strong, even if you don\u2019t lose the weight for a little while. Give it about a year and you will look and feel amazing, I can guarantee it.\n\nParticularly if your doing one meal a day. You will be fine",

I don't snore if on my front and if I'm sleeping deeply he can't get me to turn over to stop.\n\nSo I should aim for 9Kg per month? Which is just over 2Kg per week?\n\nMight cry as not lost anything in 3 weeks so far lol (I am joking, it will start to come off eventually)",

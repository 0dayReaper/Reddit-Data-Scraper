    "postText": "Found out when i was 30 after finally loosing my virginity, that my mom tried for years to make me gay. She purposely alienated me against my dad and then spent every second she could making sure i grew up without a single shred of confidence to the point that i was so fat that my penis was inside me and i felt like nobody would ever love me.  She would constantly tell me about how men are worthless unless they were rich and well hung. When i was 12/13 she told me that she gave me my middle name based on the fact she wanted me to be mad at him so i would drop his last name and her and i would be together forever\u2026i have since been to a therapist and have begun working through my life.",

I kept getting heavier trying to shove down my feeling of guilt that i wasn\u2019t a girl like she wanted.",

She said no and took me away, and did some pretty sleezy stuff with her lawyer to make sure she would win in the end. Screamed st me multiple times as a kid telling me that my father would never love me and that she is the only person who would ever be able to love me\u2026fast forward to today\u2026its  reversed, i have nothing to do with my mother and my dad and i are best friends",

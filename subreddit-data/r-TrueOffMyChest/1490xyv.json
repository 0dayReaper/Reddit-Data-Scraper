    "postText": "I am so tired of never being able to tell when someone enjoys my company or when to leave. It hurts someone more to act differently or ignore them in hopes they get the hint.\n\n I wish when they want to be alone or feel you are overstaying your welcome are upfront about it. I have asked in the past if it's okay I am here to reassure myself and they told me they enjoy my company and it's nice having me here. But obviously stress or other factors can change that so them saying that won't apply to every single hang out. \n\nI don't want to be more annoying than I already feel I am and constantly bug if I am bothering anyone or to ask for reassurance because it's embarrassing. I've told them about the way I feel about this situation and they reassured I shouldn't feel that way. \n\nI can't help but think the short answers aren't just being focused on something else already and it's them becoming short so I get the hint. Or them being in another room for some reason or another for a very long time and I don't want to follow them around like a dog in their own home so I stay seated and I can't think of anything else except they're probably hoping I leave. That's the only thought capable of being formed, questioning if I should just leave.  \n\nI know they might just want some time alone really quick for whatever reason but I can't help but to take everything personally.  \n\nI dont want to seem desperate or insecure and constantly make them reassure me because it's not their job. I just want to feel like they enjoy spending time with me as much as I enjoy being around. But I can't  demand them to act like that and show me even if that's what they truly think. \n\nI just wish I knew if my presence is as wanted as theirs is to me without constantly nagging them, making me more annoying than I might already be.  \n\nI know it's a lot of what ifs and insecurities but I don't want people to feel the need to constantly prove themselves so I am not anxious. I don't want to make them feel like they're walking on eggshells. \n\nIt's hard even trying to make sure the days we don't hang out I am texting them because I'm so scared they'll think I ignore them some days because I don't need their company so why talk to them or im using them. so then I get anxious even about bothering them too much even when we aren't hanging out. I never know the right amount and what to say without getting embarrassed of myself.",

    "postText": "So my friend is in a very happy relationship, and of course that's amazing and I'm so happy for him. Meanwhile, I'm single and I've been wanting a relationship and he knows this. I feel like SO often he sends me pictures of him and his SO together, and it's so easy to trigger those depressed/lonely feelings for me whenever he sends those pics. I wish he had the same type of awareness that I do when it comes to situations like this. Like when I was in a relationship and he was lonely and single, I never wanted to \"shove it in his face\" and send pictures of me with my (now ex)boyfriend, because I knew how lonely he was, and I didn't wanna trigger those feelings for him. But he doesn't realize that everytime he sends a picture (especially when I'm already in a very lonely/depressed mood) it just makes me sad about my own life. And I know that's really selfish of me, and I should just be happy for him without the jealousy. But it's really hard when you're depressed and lonely. I just wish he knew that sending me happy smiling pictures of him and his SO all the time is very triggering for someone who really wants a relationship and is lonely, and sick of seeing all the happy couples everywhere.",

It doesn\u2019t have to be a confrontation or a call-out \u2013 you said it yourself that he probably hasn\u2019t realised how this affects you. I could see it being a case of him just trying to take an interesting photo, being a bit single-minded in the honeymoon phase, or depending on how well you know the SO, thinking of it as sending you photos of your two friends rather than a couple you\u2019re not a part of. That doesn\u2019t mean your feelings aren\u2019t valid, though. \n\nI think if you make it clear that you\u2019re very happy for him and that it\u2019s nothing to do with him or his SO personally, but that seeing photos of happy couples can really get you down at your lowest points and his well-meaning pictures can sometimes trigger that, that\u2019s a great start. That way he shouldn\u2019t feel like his relationship is being attacked (and if he does, that\u2019s on him) and should be able to hear you out and make that adjustment for someone he cares about.\n\nIn any case, I hope it all goes well for you! It sucks that our society puts this much emphasis and pressure on finding romantic love, it can definitely feel stifling or isolating sometimes. Hang in there, you\u2019ll find that happiness with time and plenty of self-care. Good luck \u2764\ufe0f",

Thank you for validating my feelings and giving me great advice :) I do definitely struggle with getting my feelings out without hurting the other party's feelings. I struggle to find the perfect words to make it sound kind, instead of asshole-y. That's a good idea to start it off by saying it has nothing to do with him and his SO personally. And no I've never met his SO, so it's not like a friend group thing idk. Not that I wouldn't like to meet the SO, he seems really funny! But yes I think I'll need to try to let my feelings out to my friend. I just still feel bad though, I don't want him to feel hurt by me telling him to stop sending me pictures of him and his SO.

The least one can do before sending happy couple pics is to think of how the person receiving them may react to them. It's a little narcissistic without quite being aware that it is. When you're truly happy and in love you don't really project and empathize well with people who aren't in that same kind of relationship. I found there are no real tactful ways of asking not to receive those pics...",

Maybe it's not a big deal for him to change this and the problem could be solved easily. He's probably somewhat oblivious so you'll have to tell him explicitly. \n\nAlso, how old are you both? I do think society creates an expectation that you should be with someone even when you're still young (like below 22-4) and that you're really missing out if you're not. Being a bit later so you can have a mature relationship isn't bad. But I suppose you might be a bit older? Either way, a good network of friends helps. Wanting a relationship is definitely natural so don't feel bad about it. It's dangerous when it makes you feel desperate though, because that can lead to bad decisions.",

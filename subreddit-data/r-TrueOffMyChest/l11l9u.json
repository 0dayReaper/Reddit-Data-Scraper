    "postText": "I had a brief conversation with my father this past weekend.  He wanted to let me know that he is officially retiring.  I was happy for him.  The old man has been working for the last 50 years nonstop since he was a teenager.\n\nHe then said, \"Yeah, I will find part-time work to keep me busy.  I can finally do something I like doing.\"\n\nThis shook me.  50 years of hard work.  Crawled his way up the corporate ladder to a Director-level position making well over six figures.  After all that, he is just now doing something he likes doing?  It has messed with my head the last few days.  I am now questioning why I am working the job I work in corporate America.  I don't want to wake up 30 years down the road when I finally retire and say the same thing.\n\nEdit:  Wow!  I wrote this before bed to literally get it off my chest (pun intended) as my options for venting about are limited.  Thank you all for the thoughtful and funny responses!  Much love!",

So stfu and enjoy what time you have.\" He wasnt great with emotions but its helped me cope with the fact that work blows and its really about perspective",

Recently I've been planning on waiting for my wife and kids to fall asleep to just come and spend an hour... I end up falling asleep with them anyway and don't follow through with my plan.

I get to come home and eat dinner and make sure my daughter finished her home work and say hi to my family and I go to bed by 7.  I have been at work every day since the first of the year.  I work to provide for my family, to give them the life that they deserve.  I am management I have 20 people and about 4 million dollars worth of equipment that I\u2019m responsible for.  During the summer when it hits 115 degrees here and the oil running through the hay press is 170 degrees and it blows a hydronic line, I have to fix it fast and keep it running not just for me but for my employees.  Their famIlies depend on them and In turn they depend on me to keep the production up so we don\u2019t have to lay people off.  Some times I\u2019m so tired by the end of the week that I feel physically sick to my stomach( it goes away after I sleep for about 16 hrs).  I work hard, and slowly we are getting ahead. I don\u2019t work for me, I work for my family. The joy on my two year old sons face when I get him a hot wheels car, or the cool indifference of my eleven year old daughter when I pick her up a slushy, that\u2019s what makes my day.  A full fridge and a happy family. I don\u2019t tell them how much I want to sit down and play on my laptop, I try and not let them see the bone crushing tiredness, because I love them and I want them to enjoy life, and prepare them  as much as they can before they become adults.  It\u2019s the little moments of happiness that get me through my week.  \u201cFor the woods are lonely dark and deep but I have miles to go before I sleep, yes miles to go before I sleep.\u201d\n\nEdit:  thank you all for all the support in both ways, I didn\u2019t expect this to blow up.  In response to the its bad comments.  Yes it\u2019s not good, I\u2019m using this job as a spring to get to where I want to be. I don\u2019t have the luxury of just sitting and waiting for good things to fall in my lap, I have people that depend on me so I must do what I must to to not just survive but to make survival comfortable.  We are not frivolous, I used the hot wheels as an example since it\u2019s his favorite thingy at this age, it\u2019s better than being stuck in front of a tv all day.  My daughter gets more than a slushy.  She just always asked for them so that is an example.  I am her structure and she hates me half the time but she is getting better in school and her attitude is better since we started having mom stay home.\nTo all those that wonder why I decided to have children;  my wife had a her daughter from a previous relationship.  Now her daughter is our daughter. Our son was a surprise, and we made the choice to have him and raise him. It\u2019s a trial at times but when he and I go driving in my truck to the car wash or driving any where, the joy he gets from a simple drive is amazing.  When your kids come and give you a hug. Or your kissing the booboo or your helping with a creative writing assignment.  Or watching my daughters eyes light up when I tell her about all the places I traveled to when i was in the military.  That\u2019s what makes my heart literally swell.  Cooking dinner for my wife to giver a break, or just sharing memes from Reddit.  That\u2019s what helps me know that I want more, but that to get the more I must work hard.  Y\u2019all are wonderful even the negative comments.  I fought for every one to have the freedom to have their own opinions, I love seeing that in these comments, it means that the sacrifices I made when I was younger were worth it.  Y\u2019all make it a great a great day today!  (Back to work for me)",

Hes going to work himself to death doing a job he never actually wanted while he had a real passion and skill and could've been doing his own thing for way longer now. He's in his 60s and works 50+ hoursna week then comes home and fucks around in the garage for 2 ish hours and goes to bed.  Weekends are it and they're usually spent doing shit around the property to make my mum happy who doesn't work and they're POOR. She babysits.  I make more money than both of my parents combined.. we live very similar qualities of life and idfk how they're even making it. What kind of life is that? My dads been the same way his whole life too. Likely started out the same way as this dude that hasn30 awards for sacrificing his life for \"family\".. noone in my family effectively communicates anything and are overly emotional during communication and it likely all stems from seeing this type of behavior unfold growing up... I dont understand how people think working 50 hours and hiding the pain from that to \"give my kidna slushy\" is some good behavior but working a little less and being emotionally around and doing things that are REWARDING FOR YOU is seen as \"selfish and bad\".",

We've had to chase down antelopes and farm and use animals to plow fields and all that. That doesn't equate to 90+ hour weeks, though. You bring home a big kill? You're not running 6 hours after another one the next day. \nI'm not looking down on hard work, I'm looking down on the sick sense of pride that comes from having to or choosing to work this hard. There is nothing healthy about what he's doing. Working so hard you're getting sick isn't healthy. We aren't meant to work like that.

Each time we added a child to the family, I feared I would not be able to give him or her enough attention. I find people have greater potential than they believe.\n\nTruth is, my kids get tons of attention from me, especially with COVID (homeschooling and telework). \nI have averaged between 60-70 hours a week to work. \nI no longer have individual hobbies that I do by myself; rather, I've restructured my recreation to include my family as much as possible. This works to mutual benefit. \nI don't go to the bar for \"after work drinks\". Instead my wife and I split a bottle - or two bottles - of wine and watch funny TV shows or have movie night with the kids or have friends over (pre-COVID).\nI like to cook, so I teach my kids how to cook. The nice thing about having plenty of kids is that they bring a significant labor workforce to keep the house running well \ud83d\ude05 but it's genuinely rewarding to see my kids learn news skills.\n\nANYWAY... Back to the point. I am generally happy with my job but it's far from perfect or ideal. I don't miss doing the things of my \"single life\" because I started my family fairly early in life and share  hobbies with the family now. I was raised with a strong work ethic, so I don't pity myself for working long days whenever they come around. \n\nI have 5 kids and a lovely wife. My kids are thriving. I am happy.",

My mother was always busy doing chores after work and stuff that needs to be done at home. We are doing it for the children, they said. My mother told me that she does not live for herself, she sacrifices for us. They got me better clothes and saved up quite some money for my education. I did not have to do much at home, my mother cooked and cleaned. I did not appreciate this at the time. I did not learn to take care of myself as much and took it all for granted. It took a lot of time in my 20s to learn to be independent and take care of myself. The money that my parents saved up for my education just delayed this (tuition is free here) and was not spent well.\n\nMy mother worked herself into major depression that she never recovered from. Even if she tried not to show it I knew she was not happy. Kids see all even if they don't tell it. I could hear her crying alone or see her doing her chores empty eyed. I look back and remember my mother always exhausted and sad. Even though my physical needs were taken care of I did suffer mentally. The material things that my parents worked for don't matter for me one bit. I would rather had more  time with my father or a happy mother. I did not ask them to sacrifice their life for me! The stuff, expensive clothes.... I would rather not have had it, but had parents that were emotionaly there for me. I see friends who had less than me growing up, but that still have happy relationship with their parents and I envy them.",

I kind of had an experience like your kids,  my parents struggled to make sure we lived in a good school district.  I was the poor kid in a rich school and really that does kind of suck.  I also did not appreciate the sacrifice and barely graduated.  I got a girl pregnant at 16,  but it was a one night stupid fling and the mother and I kind of hated each other.  I love the kid,  but we were never  going to be a \"family\".  I join the army to pay for child support.   In do 2.5 years of a four year contract and get a \"general discharge\"  for being \"unable to adapt\" ( I got caught with a hot bong, but passed the drug test,  first sargeant went to bat for me, got kicked instead of jail).  I work 3rd shift at a gas station while prepping for art school.  I get in and do amazingly well.  Until the end of my sophomore year where I go through a breakup and melt down and drop out.  I move to texas with ex army buddies.\n\nAfter texas I drift around and become a coffee shop artist in Cincinnati.  I work in bars and restaurants and live off the grid.  I ignore responsibility and do drugs for over a decade.  I end up taking a seasonal job in a remote northern area and plan on just saving every dime and moving to colorado.  I meet a local women in the remote northern town and settle down.  I was in my mid 30s.  \n\nA decade passes and I have 2 kids, a wife a home and a small business that is miraculously doing well.  I am 45 and I am mostly happy.  My kids are well adjusted and bright,  my wife and I are happy and I often think to myself \"how the fuck\"  did it come together like this.  I did so much wrong,  I quit jobs willy nilly,  I rejected responsibility well into my 30s.  I spent years high af and crashing on couches.  Yet still fell ass backwards into small town middle class comfort.\n\nI worry sometimes that my past will come back to haunt me.  I don't have an especially good relationship with my first daughter and that bothers me,  but not for lack of trying.    One thing that is true with kids is you have to be all in or all out, halfway will only breed resentment.\n\nAnyway, at 45 I can look back on a life lived selfishly for the first half, and revel in sown \"wild oats\"  without huge regrets. I can also rest comfortably with the resolve of doing the right thing, because I didn't for so long.  My young kids will never wonder where dad is,  my wife will never have to find me in a ditch after a week-long bender.  I don't have to live with the lingering feeling of missing out on youth and exist in some middle age state of reclaiming youth.  I indulged in youth and can happily be a boring middle age nobody,  smiling while doing the mundane.",

Once we settled down, my parents were working 2 jobs. Then after 10 years they opened up a small company that allowed both of them to work from home. We lived happily, content, no luxurious vacations / presents / etc... never went to bed hungry or cold. And I don\u2019t know how my brother ignores all that. \n\nI visit my parents nearly every day! It\u2019s scary how disconnected family can become. \n\nWhen my mom told me she was saving up to buy a used car, I immediately booked an appointment to get my 2017 Jetta fixed/tuned up. Finished off my last payment and gave my mom the keys, told her to keep any money for future repairs. \n\nJust the thought of what I did / when it was going on brought so much happiness, warmth, and joy knowing I could help my parents out. And let me tell you something, I\u2019ve taken care of a disabled, but thankfully recovered, friend who needed a caregiver after his hospitalization (freak car accident)..... and it doesn\u2019t even compare to helping family, not even by a smidgen. \n\nIt\u2019s troubling how family (and even friendships) are devalued.",

Providing the basics, as challenging as it is, doesn't make you a good parent.\n\nPlay with your kids every day. Instill in them a good value system that isn't based on money. Treat them like adults, they'll always be happier following the paths they choose. Work with them to help guide them to a productive decision in that regard. Teach them to hedge their bets, so that if they make a mistake they can recover. Teach them that failing is a necessary component to success.  \n\n\nEdit: Obviously this isn't all on boomers, it goes back many generations I'm sure. Definitely my Grandparents were no better.  That's as far back as I know though.",

Those skills pay off in spades. The best thing you can do for many kids is help them figure out things on their own and build their skills, as well as becoming emotionally self aware enough to have a good grasp of what could make them happy and how they can make themselves more content without needing outside intervention. \n\n\nI am currently the \"golden child\" in regards to success, but not necessarily the favorite child of my parents. The big thing for me was that I got lucky in that I wasnt the favorite or doted upon child. Two of my brothers were babied. They're by no means bad kids or even particularly failing right now, but they tend to middle and it took them a minute to get there, imho. It depends on the kid and tailoring the strategy to each kid is apart of the calculations, but I got lucky in that I was always able to absorb a lot, filter it well (discern what was useful or even true), and run autonomously. I value friends and family. I picked up values from my parents that have proved very useful in life like being hardworking, good communication, knowing when to shut up or say something the other person wants to hear, and the all-important one of being humble but competent. But, my parents really tended to parent the two babies very heavily while leaving the rest of us to do more for ourselves. In the short run, I felt resentment back then, but now I realize I benefitted a lot from the space to solve my own problems. My mom tended to do things for them to \"help\" them, but with time it seems like both struggle to regulate their own emotions and do independent problem solving(if upset, mom will swoop in to soothe you with a gift or even try to solve your problem for you). My parents have a lot of great insights like teaching us to consider how interviewers or an outside judge would perceive us, considering work life balance, calculating out how one decision will affect us later on and generally having long term planning/financial skills. But, for the kids who were always catered to, I see them do impulsive things like quitting a job when upset and not having the next thing lined up. Or leasing an expensive truck that will hurt their budget. And my parents still clean up for them, so they dont ever change those behaviors. It's a weird type of codependency that does not help kids.",

I never had that, my dad told me \"I aint your fuckin chauffeur\" whenever I asked him for anything, so I'll cart my kids hours away for a soccer or football game.\n\nOur town is upper middle class so not many doctors, mostly nurses,  contractors, salespeople ect, so I don't think they're going to have the same resentment your's do, I hope. I do know that at 36 I hate my work and hate most of my decisions, but those decisions have led my kids to a better life so maybe, just maybe they can enjoy their life. That's the hope I guess.",

Hardship? Not so much. They've never had to deal with those things.\n\nI wish my parents talked to my siblings more about it. About passion, and failures. I'd like it if they traveled to places that aren't  just white and rich. Showed them the variety that exists in life outside their bubble. They don't see the whole world, they only see the GOOD things my parents let them see. But one day they'll leave here, and they are completely unprepared. And they don't understand or appreciate the sacrifices my parents have made, because they have no perspective. I try my best to talk to them about how to be appreciative of our parents. I talk to them about life before we were wealthy. Things that are important for them to understand.\n\nDon't assume that kids will just learn these things on their own. You need to talk to them about life and hardship and what you've done for them. I see so many people who get everything they want and don't ever internalize how beautiful and fortunate it is that they can have those things. Appreciation has to be instilled in someone, it won't just come naturally. If you want them to have it, you need to teach them. My parents complain that my youngest siblings are ungrateful... I don't know what else they expected to happen.",

The majority of retirement age people in this country don't have that luxury.  You have to ask yourself what's most important to you.  I can tell you that retiring with limited assets is a very terrifying thought when you look at the future and that future may well be living to 100.",

The idea that you live your life so you can have the job you want. Flip that around.\n\nThe thing is, a job is a tool you use to get the life you want to live. A tool can be something you enjoy using and if it doesn\u2019t work well toss it and get a new one.\n\nDon\u2019t live to work, work so you can live. Aim for your dream lifestyle. Bend your job around what you want not the other way around.\n\nEdit: when I say \u201ctoss it and get a new one\u201d I realize that this is not always easy and I don\u2019t meant to come across as saying \u201cwell just GeT aNoTher JoB\u201d. (Really I hate people who push that) What I mean is don\u2019t stay at a job you hate because of an attachment to the image of it or because your holding onto could-have/should-have and might-have-beens. Don\u2019t spend so much time/sacrifice following your dream that you forget why you started the journey to begin with.\n\n\nEdit 2: I feel like a lot of people are reading this as \u201cgive up on your dreams\u201d. That is not what I\u2019m trying to say. If you have a dream go follow it but not everyone has a plan in place for life and some have no idea what they want to do. Furthermore sometimes people\u2019s dream job is not feasible.\n\nOur society pushes 3 things: 1) you should figure out what you want to do and fast. Not knowing is seen as being lost, lazy or indecisive. 2) if you have an idea what you want to do in life, you are almost expected to be successful at it otherwise you are criticized 3) if your ideal job is not something you can make a living at then it is worth less and a \u201ctime/ money consuming hobby\u201d\n\nFor people who have no idea what they want to do in life they may be pushed into things they don\u2019t want or aren\u2019t ready for. For people who don\u2019t make it to the top of their chosen field, they are looked down on or told they don\u2019t work hard enough. I believe this can have a negative effect on people\u2019s mental health or work ethic.",

Don\u2019t follow in his footsteps\n\nLive the life you wanna live, do whatever the fuck you wanna do, and don\u2019t let idiots on Reddit talk you out of it. \n\nBest of luck to you in the future. Hope you go places\n\nEdit: I see a lot of comments saying \"cute fantasy, but unrealistic\". I can't respond to all these, but I'll say this; if the world and reality itself is so bad that you can't do what you wanna do and survive, then instead of sitting here tearing people down for their dreams, work to make a world where you could follow your own dreams and be able to survive and thrive. To quote the cool Indian guy: \"Be the change you wanna see in the world.\"\n\nI am Iron Man",

Most of what people are trying to pass off as \"The Real World, bub\" is the result of unchecked vulture capitalism that has dismantled any road to financial security and private fulfillment. There's a reason quite a few performers/thinkers/artists had working class backgrounds a few decades ago and hardly any today. With money comes opportunity, and we don't have any fucking money.",

If you\u2019re not doing regular overtime (for the sake of doing overtime), or if you\u2019re first out of the office, you\u2019re looked down upon. \u201cYou get 8 hr of sleep? Well lucky you. I get 3, get on my level\u201d etc\n\nDoes it make me entitled to not want to sacrifice my physical and mental health for what\u2019s ultimately someone else\u2019s bottom line? I\u2019m just here to do what I\u2019m paid for. Any extra needs to come with compensation. It\u2019s just business, and plus, they can get rid of me at any time at the drop of the hat.\n\nOlder folks in the office would say that yes, I\u2019m entitled with that attitude... ugh. It really messes with my head. I want to be \u201cdevoted\u201d and \u201cpassionate\u201d to my job and work, but at the same time, I feel like there needs to be a line in order to retain a sense of humanity.\n\nAnyway, sorry, you probably didn\u2019t ask for opinion, just had to vent.",

Been working low middle management IT work for nearly 13 years, decent pay, great benefits, low pressure and comfortable. Nothing wrong with that, it\u2019s absolutely a technical job that requires a skilled worker, but it doesn\u2019t fill my cup. Decided to instead pursue my passion for EMS, specifically firefighting. The decrease in pay I am taking is substantial (10s of thousands a year). But I enrolled in an EMT class in the Fall (and just graduated today, actually). Applied to be a firefighter in the Fall and got all the way to oral interviews. Making connections in the local EMS scene. Trying again this year, and as many years as it takes because this is what I want to do with my life and at a certain point you value how you spend your time and happiness more than how you spend your bank account.",

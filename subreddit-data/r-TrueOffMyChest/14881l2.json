    "postText": "I was driving to work one morning, and along my commute, I saw something/someone out of the corner of my eye when I drove past. It looked like someone was sitting up against a building and waving at traffic. \n\nI thought it was weird, but chalked it up to me driving past quickly and not getting a good enough look at what it was. \n\nThe next day when I drove by the same area, I noticed a bunch of flyers and balloons taped to a building sign closer to the road. I asked my friend who works in the area what happened, and he told me he heard that someone had died behind his shop.\n\nThere's been nothing in the paper, the police never asked them for any video footage, no posts on social media, so I'm kinda unsettled that if someone did I fact die behind my buddies work, and I drove past them, I did absolutely nothing to help them. Like, I could have saved that person if I had just been paying better attention, and I just feel extremely guilty, like it's kind of my fault.",

    "postText": "Using an old account. I wasn\u2019t sure about posting this on my main one.\n\nI don\u2019t know why, everything in my life just seems so..bland. The days will be slightly different, and I\u2019ll do some different things, but by the end, when I go into my room to relax; it always feels like I\u2019ve done nothing at all or that there\u2019s more to do. \n\nI barely even try to go to sleep. Even when it isn\u2019t, my day feels so full or busy that I want to stay up to watch TV or play games. I never plan to fall asleep. It just happens when I lay down to play my Switch. I\u2019m always up to 3 or 4 even when I need to get up early. \n\nI\u2019m told I\u2019m great at my sport. I go to a competition, do decently but have never one, everyone says it was a good try (it\u2019s always been a good try or attempt for the past 9 years), I go back to practice, and the cycle continues. Never really accomplishing anything, and hearing everyone talk about how much I\u2019m improving. \n\nI have no friends. I always say I do, but I lost contact with everyone from school. An old friend I found at my College stopped responding to my texts. I\u2019m friendly with the people at my sport, but never do anything but brief chats and jokes with them. I don\u2019t really have any friends, and don\u2019t think I know how to talk to anyone well enough to get one. \n\nI have no personality. I don\u2019t think I look terrible, but I\u2019m certain I don\u2019t look great. I don\u2019t know how everyone else always seems so smart, confident, good looking, attractive, etc; and I\u2019m none of that. \n\nI thought a trip would change that. That it was sticking to the same schedule at home, being around the same people, or something. But I\u2019m somewhere else, all on my own, and nothing\u2019s changed. \n\nI don\u2019t even know how to be honest about it. I don\u2019t know who I\u2019d tell it to, or why they\u2019d want to listen to me talk about it. I\u2019m just here, wallowing over it.",

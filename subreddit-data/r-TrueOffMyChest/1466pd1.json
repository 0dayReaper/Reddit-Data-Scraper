A little while ago I got close to a man from my work and we kissed. \n\nFred (my fianc\u00e9) went out to the bar at around about 9 pm by about 9:20 I packed all of my essentials and drove straight to my friend's house I\u2019m going to stay here as long as I need. As for Fred, he messaged me at 6 am asking where I am and threatening to do unspeakable things to me. It\u2019s now almost 7 pm and he\u2019s calling me so many times. \n\nAs for the new guy James when I showed my friend a picture of him she recognised him, turns out he\u2019s a close friend of one of her other friends and he\u2019s a really good guy. That\u2019s all for now but I\u2019ll update if anything at all happens.",

Go to your local magistrates office and take out charges for communicating threats or whatever charge it is in your state when someone threatens another. \n\nWhen police take out charges they are normally taking out the charges on behalf of the state. Sometimes it is on your behalf but not normally which is why victims can\u2019t just have charges dropped if they decide they don\u2019t want to pursue them any longer as the charges are taken out on the states behalf not the victims. When you go to the magistrates office and take out the charges yourself it is you taking them out. The assistant district attorney will still prosecute it however you will be the one turning over your evidence to them instead of the police. So when the police say they can\u2019t do it YOU still can if you have proof. If you show the police texts of someone texting you threats you really can\u2019t prove that is the person you say it is. A magistrate for the most part doesn\u2019t care about that as much. They will expect you to swear what you say is the truth then you give the evidence to the prosecutor.",

It will be the assistant district attorney who prosecutes the case. In civil cases where you may be suing someone for money owned for example both sides can hire an attorney if they want. If you don\u2019t hire an attorney you will represent yourself. In criminal cases where things like stalking, assaults, communicating threats, etc. are handled only the defendant(person charged with a crime) has the option to hire an attorney or not. This is because criminals cases are always prosecuted by the counties district attorneys or assistant district attorneys. What I would advice you to do is call the courthouse if the are open and if it is the weekend or odd hours call the sheriffs office and ask where the magistrates office is. Bring all the evidence you have-they may not ask to see it then but they could ask to see it then. For example if you want to get John Doe charged for communicating threats he send you over text and voicemail you will want to have those texts and voicemails handy. If you have some sort of proof that the number these texts and voicemails are coming from bring that as well however most people won\u2019t be lucky enough to have that. The magistrate will ask you write down the events that happened in an affidavit. Once it is completed you will swear on Bible that what you said happened is the truth. They will review what you said happened and determine what crimes were allegedly broke. Once they determine this they will speak to you and let you know what was decided as far as if a law was broke, what they are being charged with, etc. \n\nYour process may differ slightly but every time I have had to go to a magistrate to take out charges(only twice both in assault cases as the police didn\u2019t see the assault happen only the red marks and naturally the cops didn\u2019t know where the marks came from for sure) this was the process as well as anytime I\u2019ve went with someone else as support when they took out charges. This should generally be the process. Regardless the magistrate will let you know what the process is once you get to their office. My understanding is a magistrate is available basically 24/7. I have gone as late as 9pm on the weekend with a friend before. \n\nAs far as going to the cops you can always reach out to the cops for help. However if there isn\u2019t a lot of evidence or the evidence you provide doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be from the crime you allege(like a red mark on your arm-sure someone could have hit you. You also could have hit yourself to frame them. Who knows? Not the cops.) they may not be willing to take out charges. Cops do get use their own discretion a lot so they will take out charges with limited evidence at times and other times that won\u2019t. Point being if they won\u2019t take out charges when you ask you then go to the magistrate or I have never seen deny anyone the ability to take out charges. Naturally if you have charges taken out a few times then always drop them the magistrate may stop taking them out for you or if you take them out often and never have evidence when it goes to court they could stop taking them out for you without seeing evidence in advance. However as long as you are using this only to take out charges on crimes that did happen you shouldn\u2019t have an issue. \n\nI try not to tell too many people this as I have told someone who took out completely false charges on someone and of course they were eventually dropped in court but now that arrest is on that persons record and they were removed from work while the charge was going through the court system so I be careful not to tell everyone about this and I would advise you do the same. You never know what someone may do when upset as I learned first hand.",

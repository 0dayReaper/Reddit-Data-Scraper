    "postText": "I want to get over them and just move on. I was raped several years ago and the man who did it purposely used me for sex on and off for years afterwards,taking advantage of me and how naive I was. I was also taken advantage of by a different man while I was blacked out in college, but I'm unaware of the extent of the assault (did have medical exam). I am now older but still struggle emotionally with moving on because I feel like no one would want me if I tell them the truth. For a while I even deluded myself into thinking I was in love with this person. I have a hard time dating people who are nice to me or who are respectful. I also have other issues men don't want to deal with like social anxiety, starving myself, binge eating. And engaging in prostitution. I feel like I don't deserve a good or kind man",

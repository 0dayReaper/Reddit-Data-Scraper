    "postText": "Fourteen years ago I was sexually assaulted at a pool. I stopped going to pools altogether for what must\u2019ve been 8 years, then slowly started going with friends again. It was really disheartening because prior to the assault I loved swimming. Around that time my friends started taking me I tried to go alone but experienced a panic attack. Ever since I haven\u2019t gone without bringing along someone for support. It\u2019s been at least four years since I last went swimming, and today I went for a good half hour alone and had no panic attacks! Once I got in the water lots of emotions happened, but I was mindful of them and things went okay-aside from realizing how out of shape I am\ud83d\ude05 I feel like I took a big step toward recovering from my assault!\n\nHope everyone has a great rest of a week!",

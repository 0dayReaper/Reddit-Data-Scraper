    "postText": "My (33) daughters (10) father (33) and I have an agreement that she goes to see him every summer for the whole summer. I live in the Midwest and he lives on the east coast where I met him and had her. We have not been together since she was around maybe 4-5 months old when I found out he was cheating with his now ex-wife. Now I am not the typical bitter ex, I could care less what this man does with his life as long as it doesn\u2019t affect my daughter\u2019s life. \n\nNow for the reason I call him an idiot and why he remains as D*****s in my phone. Like I said she goes to his over the summer most of the time he picks her up, but occasionally we will do an unaccompanied minor flight if he has a prior engagement. I don\u2019t mind this my daughter is mature enough and aware of her surroundings because I and my fianc\u00e9 have taught her that she needs to remain vigilant. I was under the impression that she was getting picked up by him and getting on a 9:30pm flight and going to pick up his other daughter on the west coast. I find out tonight that she is getting on her flight alone and won\u2019t be landing until after midnight on the east coast. I was not happy because I\u2019m finding out very important details at the last minute and I would not have allowed her to get on a flight so late at night. He is acting like there is nothing wrong and that I am being paranoid. I told him as a man you do not have to worry about those types of things and even at 33 I would never fly alone so late at night, especially with so many kids and women going missing. I called him an idiot and put him on mute because if he keeps texting me imma blow up. \n\nFor context he always ALWAYS waits till the last minute to let me know of any last minute details. He tried to gaslight me saying that he told me through text and I\u2019m like I read through our texts, no you didn\u2019t. Then he said he to told my 10 year old, 1st off she\u2019s 10 she isn\u2019t going to listen to everything, 2nd he told a 10 year old instead of me. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot more to mine and his coparenting that leaves me irritated with him. And anyone that says I\u2019m bitter, just know I\u2019ve been in a stable relationship for 8 years with the same man and he isn\u2019t on child support and does the bare minimum for her and do mean the barest of minimums.",

    "postText": "Let me explain. I haven't seen my brother in two years. He is coming to stay in the town I live in for a few days for work and has plans of staying at my house for 1 night of his several night stay. We plan on getting a drink, a bite to eat then head back to my place to chill for a few.\n\n\nMy wife is very abusive, manipulative and controlling. She has spent the last few days berating me for seeing my brother (it goes against her evil agenda of trying to separate me from anyone and everyone I love). She has been making comments about how fucked up it is that I expect her to put two kids to bed tonight by herself. Her \"compromise\" is that I get home by 11 and help her with the kids if they aren't already asleep. Ive obviously been pushing back on this, since she is a grown ass woman and can handle putting the kids to bed by herself once (remember, haven't seen my bro in 2 years). His flight getting delayed 30 mins delays my plans 30 mins and I will be abused and berated for it. I hate it, I'm terrified of this evil bitch but I feel so stuck.\n\nEdit: Holy crap this blew up. Thank you to everyone for the kind words and support. I knew this wasn't normal behavior but needed to hear it, and the peope have spoken. My wife is BPD possible narcissistic and is very extreme in her responses to anything she doesnt like or agree with. Because of this, I have slowly been conditioned to let her have her way and abuse me. It happened so subtly and right under my nose. Abuse against men is real and I can't believe I let it get this far. I HAVE taken steps toward a divorce, but pulling the trigger on it has been hard, the idea of not seeing my kids everyday is terrifying but as many have pointed out, they'll be better off to get away from this environment. As for the people who told me to grow a pair or man up, I get it, and youre right. There is a responsibility on my part to establish boundaries but the consequences of attempting to do that at this point include her attempting to get me fired, trashing my office etc. She GOES there, and Im working closely with a therapist to navigate my way out with minimal collateral damage. Thank you to everyone who direct messaged me as well. I'll do my best to respond tomorrow, I will post an update tomorrow as well. Thanks again all.",

Work with your therapist and lawyer on crafting a case for full custody. Make an action plan to move with the kids back closer to your family/support system. Make a plan and then stick to the plan. When she blows up and tries to bring the kids in call the cops or create alternate response via therapist and lawyer. You got this. Get organized and take your life back.",

OP, when you\u2019re going to tell your wife your ready for divorce do it somewhere in public, have your kids posted up at your parents or wherever for the weekend, record everything, keep yourself away from her after the event. Keep recording everything she is doing up until then, take your time with any decisions you\u2019re going to make, and please be careful.",

So many women are murdered because they are terrified to leave, but if they leave, they're more likely to be murdered. I don't know if the statistics are the same on the men's side but ALWAYS be prepared, NEVER go alone. Hell, call the police and get an escort if you need to. Bitches be crazy.\n\n\n- abuse victim",

I am a researcher and have worked with abuse survivors....it takes an average of 11 attempts before a person being abused leaves for good. 19% of domestic violence ends up involving a weapon. I can't find the supporting stats right now, but the leaving time is the most dangerous. Have a plan.  An escape bag. Access to money that your SO doesn't know about.  DV shelters often advise moving out of your local area. Every DV non profit I have worked with have had male survivors living there or participating in offered therapy. Some of them had suffered extreme violence and trauma. There are resources and you aren't alone. Be safe!",

A lot of domestic violence murders happen when the victim tries to leave. \n\nI know you can't leave immediatly, so in the mean time document as much as you can. Keep a detailed journal of every occurrence and act of abuse - whether it be some small verbal remark or a physical assault- with a date, time, and as much as you can remember. If your state allows 1 party consent recordings then voice record as much as possible. \n\nI assume you want full custody of the kids. This is your best way to get that since it is so rare for fathers (assuming you're a man) to get custody of their kids. \n\nI know you may not think she will fight for the kids or try to kill you, but there was a time when you never thought she would abuse you. Do not trust her. \n\nDocument as much as you can. And have a game plan to get out. Speak with an attorney privately to get your affairs in order. \n\nI hope this works out the best for you.

Document EVERYTHING. Fight your fucking ass off for your kids. You will pull the trigger on divorce and feel broken and empty. Fight through that. Fight for your kids. Took me 3 years to get mine back to joint. Anything and everything will be a battle. Have an amazing, wonderful wife now who supports and loves my kid. I fucked up the process along the way. She helped me through it. Again, the above advice is good. If you are feeling this way now, it will only get worse. Do what is good for you. Emotional abuse is still abuse my duder. Keep yourself healthy and keep your self safe. And always keep your kids future's as your priority. You got this. I have faith in you fellow anon.",

This was a guy I worked with years ago who filed for divorce and custody of his two kids after finding out that his wife had cheated on him multiple times. She supposedly also got pregnant, had at least one abortion without him knowing and spent roughly $100K of his inheritance from his father without him knowing because she managed the finances. Turns out that she had a serious opiate issue that she hid for a few years until she graduated to Heroin, he claims he couldn't tell. He constantly gave her the benefit of the doubt, ignoring rumors and cutting people out of their lives. What blew it all up was when he was attempting to refinance their mortgage into better loan with like 2.5% lower interest rate and saving them like $1000/mo (which is HUGE), she kept fighting him on it, refusing to fill out paperwork, refusing or forgetting to sign things, he eventually checked their savings account to see what they had for loan collateral and realized that most of the money was gone. She lied to him for nearly a week claiming that someone must have stolen their identity and taken the money, and when the bank provided evidence of all of the transfers and withdrawals, she threatened to kill herself and he had to have her mother come talk her down and get her out of the house. \n\nThis lady completed a 45 day inpatient program and that was all the judge needed to see in order to determine that she was fit for custody. The guy did eventually get his divorce and the divorce proceedings went better for him, he was awarded the house and any equity due to the evidence of her draining inheritance money that he came into the marriage with. She lived with her parents for a bit but after the divorce, she dropped off the kids one weekend and was gone when he brought them back to her parents house, she actually drove across the country with her junkie boyfriend, didn't tell her parents or the kids that she was leaving. Asshole didn't call or speak to her kids for over a year and then came back one day and asked them if they wanted to move back with her at her parents house.\n\nThis was years ago, and those kids are now young adults, they know exactly who their mother is and what she did to them and their father. His oldest daughter actually slapped the shit out of her because the money she stole was meant to pay for a considerable part of her college, so she had to turn down her dream school because she couldn't get enough scholarships or financial assistance, and when she told her mother about it, her mother told her \"why do you care about college, I did you a favor, you wouldn't have made it anyway, just find a man and have kids\". \n\nThe sad part is, I'm sure there are people with worse stories of nightmare spouses and ridiculous custody battles.",

Once my manipulative wife was listing all of the things he was putting up with and she described me. The next day I told her. \u201cYou need to move out\u201d and I repeated what she said. She said \u201cI meant her\u201d I said \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d and she said \u201cOh, you think it\u2019s gonna be all roses for you and the kids?\u201d I said as long as you\u2019re gone, we\u2019ll take our chances.

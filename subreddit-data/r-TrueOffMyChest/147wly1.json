    "postText": "I only have one friend. Outside of that internet friendship, I have no hobbies or relationships or activities I participate in because of a mental condition. I just work a retail job for as many hours as possible to distract myself. They're leaving for a while, and I didn't realize how much I relied on them to make life tolerable. There is absolutely no meaning to anything I do. It's agonizing, and I feel so guilty, because I should be able to handle myself. I wish I could work more. That's all.",

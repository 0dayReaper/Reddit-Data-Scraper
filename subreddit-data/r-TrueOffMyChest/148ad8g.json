    "postText": "Hi guys, there was this girl who i used to talk to everyday through text and calls we bonded really well, as the time passed by i started catching  feelings for her, so somehow I gathered courage and, asked her out and, when I asked her out she told me that she was in a relationship. So there and there i decided to tell her what was going on in my mind since I got to know she was in a relationship there was no use of wasting my time behind her. But now the thing is that since we were talking so much why didn't she mention it to me about her being in a relationship ? I even asked her this question and she didn't even have any answer to it. Well i took rejection in a positive way she only just saw me as a good friend And, later on she went to mention let's not ruin our bond and let's forget what all just happened and since that day she didn't even try to reach out to me a and it's been a month we havent spoke to eachother . If so much she cared about our bond why she didn't get back to me. Now I am really depressed cause we both ain't convocating. I am trying really hard to get her out of my mind but it ain't working.",

Give yourself time to feel sad about it, and know that little by little you will feel better. You deserve to be loved and appreciated. And you deserve to be with someone who can be honest with you. You\u2019ll find someone. And in the meantime please give yourself a hug from me &lt;3",

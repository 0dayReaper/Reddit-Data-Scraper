    "postText": "Hi everyone, so lately I(18f)'ve been struggling in my current relationship with a partner (19m)of 2 years.However even tho  I try I can never trust him because of his past mistakes such as not doing anything for our valentine's day,going to a other country without telling or posting status about woman even tho he considers it a joke .He is loyal and a caring person and we truely love each other but everytime I feel like i have to make an effort to continue in the relationship.\u0130t always goes like this when there is an issue: we give each other the silent treatment (mostly him),we finally talk and he makes promises . Everything is perfect for a couple weeks than it starts again. Everytime we fight i feel this deep sense of fear to be without him and alone because I don't think that i have the capacity to love someone else if we ever broke up.And on the other end I can never fully trust him or feel safe and I hate my self for not being respected or valued .\u0130 feel physically ill and in pain and don't know how to stop it .Please someone give me advice on what to do because I feel powerless in front of this situation and I honestly don't understand why it effects me so much which  leaves me scared \ud83e\udd79",

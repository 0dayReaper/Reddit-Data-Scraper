    "postText": "At least, I think I did. Either that, or there's someone in his city who looks *just* like him. I was in his area because I had a doctor's appointment. I watched him walk out of the store holding hands with his girlfriend, right in front of my car as I was waiting for people to pass.\n\n\nHe isn't a recent ex. We dated nearly 4 years ago, but I think about him fairly often. As in, he crosses my mind a couple times a month at least. I miss him when I think of him, but you know how they say you never stop loving your first love? I think it's kind of like that. But moreso than that, I think he crosses my mind so often because of the way things went when we last spoke. I have no excuse, even if I have an explanation.\n\n\nLast we spoke was give or take about a year ago. I was recently out of an emotionaly sexually abusive relationship (my most recent ex) and I was high and depressed as shit. I think I was grasping for any sort of familiarity I could (given how confidence and soul crushing my recent abusive relationship had been) and missing him badly, so I reached out to him. He's pretty much the only boyfriend I've had who I look back on positively. He seemed happy to hear from me, but I won't lie, I definitely reached out intending to reconnect, you know, romantically. I think I also hoped that he missed me too. When we broke up, I thought for sure he would regret it, and I know he kind of did at some point because he reached back out a few months after the breakup, but it didn't pan out. I guess I hoped maybe he hadn't moved on.\n\n\nBut he told me he had a new girlfriend, and that they were planning on moving in together. Well shit. There went my hopes. And you know what I said to him? I essentially told him that if he and his girlfriend ever broke up to hit me up. This, obviously, pissed him off. I apologized to him when I realized how desperate and trying-to-get-him-to-break-up-with-his-girfriend that seemed. \n\n\nBut there was no coming back from that. There's no way to NOT seem like the crazy ex trying to sabotage his relationship at that point. I apologized again and told him I'd never contact him again unless he contacted me first. I then proceeded to block him on everything because I was embarrassed. I still am. Sometimes I think about reaching out again to apologize again, but I know that would be stupid and purely self serving, so I squash the idea when it comes up.\n\n\nAnd I won't lie, it stung when I saw him with her. I think I felt jealous, although at this point I don't know if I'm jealous of her or jealous of him, or both. Maybe I'm jealous of their happy relationship or maybe I still haven't completely moved on. Or maybe it's just my period and the fact I've been sick for a week! I don't know. I haven't had much luck in the romance department since him, and my mental health stays in the gutter. I've dated guys since him but my relationships with them weren't good (see abusive ex again). I suppose maybe it still hurts because we had a good thing going for a while and I always thought our relationship ended for stupid reasons. I sometimes think we'd still be together had it not been for the aforementioned stupid reasons. I also often find myself thinking that I will not find someone who I love and who loves me again. I look back on that boy and our relationship with utmost fondness, even if we were both young and flawed. I probably hold onto my memory of him since I don't think I'll experience that again, so it's the closest I have.\n\n\nBut he doesn't look any different than I remember him. And he looked so happy. I hope he's happy, and I hope she's happy with him, because he's a great guy. I wish the best for him, even if I didn't act like it. \n\n\nIf he ever thinks of me, or sees me, or, hell, if he somehow sees this post, I hope he knows how much I regret the pure disrespect I showed him and his girlfriend when we last spoke and I hope he knows how sorry I am about everything.",

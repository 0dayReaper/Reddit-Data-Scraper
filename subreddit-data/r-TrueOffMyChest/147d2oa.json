    "postText": " My mother 45f has just told me 21f she \"is starting to resent me\" as her daughter. And I haven't done anything absolutely terrible at all. You'd think I'm a drug addict or criminal if she resents me this badly. All I have done is slack alot on dishes the past few months. I've been in a depression rut and I've just now started to be able to properly clean and take care of myself let alone the whole kitchen. I genuinely would never say that I resent my child... any advice ?",

            "comment": "Perhaps more context is needed, but it doesn\u2019t sound like your mother was suggesting you are awful, just that they resent your behaviour. I think that is totally reasonable. While you are their child, you are also an adult and should be cleaning up after yourself. I\u2019m sorry you have been having a rough time, but from the flip side, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to live with another adult that doesn\u2019t do their share. Instead of focusing on being offended by what she said, I think it\u2019s time to reflect and step up, or communicate clearly about why you haven\u2019t been.",

She makes messes and doesn't clean up after herself. Usually I would be able to keep up but my schedule had changed so much within the last 3 weeks I couldn't keep up and did them little by little then today I cleaned them all up and before I even had a chance to start She said she resented me. Also I don't communicate to her how I feel because she will then  turn how I feel into the whole \"I'm a bad mom\" guilt trip conversation and nothing about how I feel gets said or discussed. But I do admit I haven't been doing my best on them dishes lol.",

I still wouldn\u2019t hold on to specifically what she said though. If she keeps repeating it, maybe. But it sounds like something said out of frustration, again at your behaviour, not at you as a person. Our parents are people too and aren\u2019t always going to articulate themselves in the best way. Best of luck with the new job!",

But, so did I to her. She always admitted and apologized eventually, and so did I when it was me.\n\nI would give her some time and I would not try to inflame the situation, but eventually I would probably want her to at least confirm that it was said in frustration and she apologizes for it. But you might also have to admit that, even if you have reason for it, it is a bit frustrating to have someone start slacking as you say on cleaning tasks. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t devalue your depression to acknowledge her frustration, but yeah I would want some acknowledgement from her that she said something hurtful and she apologizes.",

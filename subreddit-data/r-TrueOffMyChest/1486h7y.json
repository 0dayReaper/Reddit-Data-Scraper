    "postText": "It was my birthday yesterday. I turned 22. Reflecting on how I feel like I\u2019ve failed in some aspects of my life. No friends, no BF, nothing.\n\n\nNever had a relationship on my life. Yea I\u2019ve had crushes but never really had someone express interest in me. Makes me feel like somethings wrong with me \n\n\nRecently ended some friendships. I was always the one to reach out and ask to hang out and my so called friends would take days to respond and I was always the one to contact them first. What\u2019s the point? \n\nYesterday was my birthday and no so called \u201cfriends\u201d texted me to even wish me a happy birthday. It just really hurts to have people you used to be close with not even bother to text me a single message. \n\nI know it may sound dramatic but I just felt like this was my breaking point and I just feel so so lonely all the time. I have nobody to rely on besides my family and just crave having a relationship whether that be a friendship or a boyfriend. I\u2019ve felt nothing these past months and I\u2019m so lonely it\u2019s making me severely depressed. \n\n\nI really just needed to get this off my chest since I don\u2019t have anyone I can really talk to this about.",

But it\u2019s better to try than to do nothing and wonder why. \n\nI challenge you to volunteer some where for even one night/evening. Even just an hour. A church, a homeless shelter, a animal rescue, take a free trial class at a local MMA/some kind of martial arts gym, whatever. You may not meet a friend, but you\u2019ll have social interactions outside the norm. \n\nSometimes you don\u2019t exactly need relationships, you just need something to change the pace of life. Of course relationships are great and great coupled with interesting experience, but sometimes interesting experience is enough and enough to change your mindset and life. \n\nFew people have everything going for them. Make the most of what you have and can do",

            "comment": "I don't know where or when you met your former friends, but it seems like you're at the age where sometimes people are branching off on different directions and it's pretty normal for childhood/adolescent friendships to fade. I think it may be a good idea to pursue things that you care about and meet people in those venues, or find a new hobby and meet people through that. I know it's cliched but you do have to put yourself out there to increase the odds of finding people, or romantic partners, that you click with. \n\nI've definitely struggled with this, I'm very introverted, didn't have a real relationship until about your age, and at every phase of life I seem to lose touch with my \"friends\" and wonder if they were ever really that if they don't reach out to me. But hang in there, you're young and if you put yourself and your health first, don't seclude yourself or self-medicate like I did for too long, just really pursue what you like, you'll be ok.",

    "postText": "Indirect follow-up of a post here, but stuff hits the fan hard mainly when it\u2019s fully thrown at it.\n\nBeing bedridden due to her back needing surgery, my bratty and spoiled adult sister that never took her life responsibilities seriously and hates whenever she receives a \u201cno\u201d kept growing restless since she is very independent as a person.\nBecause she kept being irresponsible way before her back gave out, her academic life is in disarray \u2014 to put it mildly \u2014 and I am doing the most I can to help her try to mend it. Turns out it\u2019s very very hard to earn sympathy when everyone knows you\u2019re a notorious \u201cghost student\u201d, that you\u2019re always on last call to hand-in sloppy projects, that you only go to class to get the attendance and then screws right off to party.\n\nEven our professors, which are the same mostly because we\u2019re both majoring in psychology, said they could only do what she \u201cleft for them\u201d. Meaning they could\u2019ve helped more if she was the very LEAST, a decent student\u2026 that is VERY sad to hear as her sister. I am not THE golden student by any means but damn, I am glad she didn\u2019t hear this.\n\nShe vented on her Twitter, which is another impulsive thing she always does because her life is never private, and someone from her class printed it and put it on blast in the class\u2019 Whatsapp group\u2026\u2026.\n\nOne of her friends called me and sent me everyone of them. Being snarky, being mean, being annoyed and hurt.\nI agree with everyone. She\u2019s shown trying to apologize but it\u2019s WAY pst it now.\n\nNow she is crying, saying it is unfair and that she didn\u2019t mean the way she said things\u2026 dad went to sleep not wanting to deal with it, I am studying because I have an academic life still and mother is scolding her \u2014 refreshing to see actually, it\u2019s a scold-soothe though.\n\nI am happy, she\u2019s finally reaping what she sowed, she\u2019s obligated to face it now.\nBut I am also angry at her still being a brat even in her current situation and never taking responsibility.",

    "postText": "We are going on a girl\u2019s trip to London in a few months and are currently planning the trip. Since I\u2019ve never been on a 1:1 trip with her, I thought this would be a fun time to do so since it\u2019s somewhere we are both keen on going, and it\u2019s after to have a companion when visiting a new city.\n\nSo as we are planning the trip, right off the bat, she said that she\u2019s planning to go to four different musicals. I told her that\u2019s fine, I can go and walk around the city by myself since I\u2019m not a huge fan of musicals. We originally had scheduled a few fancy restaurants that we wanted to try, but suddenly she decided that she didn\u2019t want to go to so many restaurants and only wanted to go to two. Subsequently, she decided that she would meet with her other friends in the city for meals instead. \n\nWe had also planned to visit a couple of attractions that I was keen on going, but on the recommendations of her friend, she decided to replace \u2018my\u2019 places with her friend\u2019s suggestion instead, and told me, \u2018oh you\u2019re free to join me if you want\u2019. That made me a little frustrated because I had told her that I was interested in visiting those places together and she had agreed. \n\nTo be fair, her personality is very much the \u2018you don\u2019t have to compromise for me, and I won\u2019t have to compromise for you\u2019 type \u2014 to which she has also verbally expressed this many times. I\u2019m the beginning I thought I would be ok with this sorta half-solo trip, but now I\u2019m starting to sorely regret my decision because I feel like I\u2019m compromising too much for what she wants to do instead.",

You\u2019ve got shit you wanna do, go do it, and if she gets mad about that, tell her to get fucked. You\u2019re supposed to enjoy travelling, not much point wasting that kind of money if you regret it.",

            "comment": "Option A would be cancel the trip (if at all possible) if this really isn\u2019t something that sounds enjoyable to you now that you have a clearer picture of what it\u2019ll be like. No shame in that. Solo adventuring in a foreign country isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s idea of a good time, and that\u2019s fine.\n\nOption B (as others are suggesting) is to just embrace that this will be predominantly a solo adventure and make the most of your time there doing all the things *you* wanna do without having to worry about doing what anyone else wants to do! Which could be even better if you\u2019re up for it &lt;3 \n\nYour call either way. If it\u2019s too late to cancel, then Ty to get yourself psyched up for some solo tourism ;)",

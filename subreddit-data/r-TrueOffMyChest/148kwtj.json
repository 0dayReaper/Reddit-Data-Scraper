    "postText": "I don't even pray. Whatever deity is willing to help, I hope You help. I can't take this fucking job anymore.\n\nI've cried three times today. Once on the phone with a sales rep because I legit couldn't hold it in. He's like \"tell me who pissed you off and I'll go after 'em. I'm just a country boy, ain't nothin' they can do to me.\" \n\nI have never been as bad at a job as I am this job, and I don't know what the deal is. I don't do anything different from any of my coworkers, but every single project I've gotten has been an absolute disaster.\n\nOne project, that's been going for six months now, we've installed the wrong part at all of our locations. My boss thinks I should keep them going and not worry about it. But it's the wrong part. Sites aren't in compliance because it's the wrong part, and he wants me to keep going. I've even brought up before that the issues we were having may be caused by a wrong part, but everyone told me that engineering gave the part we're installing, so it can't be that. Turns out. Engineering was wrong.\n\nOne project I told the customer the intent was to finish in May, with some sites going into June, and come June 1, they escalated on me (without even talking about it on the project calls that we hold every week) that the project wasn't complete. Nevermind the fact that half of their setup wasn't even done when we started the project, and won't be done until well after the project is complete.\n\nAnother project, my sub dropped because I had the audacity to continue to ask for a schedule so I could let the customer know when they'd be on site. That was too much for them because they were like \"well obviously we can't deliver what you're looking for so you may just want to find someone else to do this work.\" like, bruh. all I need is a schedule because I have to tell these people when you're showing up. When they WOULD give me a schedule, they missed every single fuckin date on the schedule. So I did kick them from the project and have been trying to find replacements. Everything has to be done by june.\n\nI have another project that my subs can't just..........do what they need to do. they have to map out devices in stores. They can't do it. I have to create checklists of everything that's missing for 60+ sites. Literally all the needed to do was walk in and point shit out and they can't even fucking do that.\n\nI'm getting ready to start another project that I have to wait two weeks for drawings. \n\nThe point of the team I'm on is to quickly assign jobs to subs and get the work done. Turn and burn. None of my projects have been turn and burn, and it hasn't been for lack of trying. EVerything I've gotten has either been \"Here's this project, it's on hold for the rest of the year,\" or \"here's this project, it's on hold until August,\" or \"here's this project, but don't start it yet.\" I can't assign jobs to subs if there's no start date.\n\nI've finally got everything scheduled for a project that has a budget of barely minimum wage for a day's worth of work that no one wanted to take because there's no money in it. And now I can't even do that because of the wrong fucking part!\n\nMy coworker has been adding me to her emails out to subs and saying \"she has jobs too, can you help her out?\" and I swear to you, one sub emailed her back \"Great! I'd love to do these jobs for you! thank you so much!\" and he responded to me, \"Thanks for reaching out.\"\n\nMy one coworker is a lazy piece of shit, but somehow she gets her jobs assigned and done.\n\nMy other coworker is constantly on her phone and tiktok and facebook and bitching about something, but somehow her shit is always done. \n\nLike. I don't get it. I'm trying so fucking hard and I'm failing everywhere and I'm so sick of it. I'm very clearly bad at this job without even trying to be bad at this job.",

    "postText": "One of my friends I am 99% sure they have both depression and an eating disorder, but what bothers me is that they refuse to do anything to try and fix it. We'll just call him John (20) and call my other friend Steve (22). So, we're all in a call and Steve brings up how his girlfriend is more of a grazer and doesn't really eat big meals, this reminded me of when I was a kid and I mentioned how I would eat 4 fish fingers and a single potato waffle for dinner and that's it. These days I'll eat 3 times that much. John says that would pretty much fill him up now and that's usually all he eats for dinner, plus occasionally skipping meals. Not to mention he's almost perpetually tired, no matter what time of day, he's always tired and he became exhausted from going on a picnic with his parents then going home.\n\nOn top of all of that John's make posts on twitter saying how he doesn't want to turn his music off cause he's scared of being alone with his thoughts and that he's broke down crying for no reason. Obviously, I keep getting really concerned that he's struggling so I keep reaching out to him. Sometimes I ask him \"Is everything alright? You can come stay at my place for the weekend\" but he'll say it's fine. Other times I try to be more forceful and tell him he needs to sort this out cause it's a problem and he'll simple just go \"meh\" or say he can deal with it.\n\nI am just tired of trying to help people who are obviously struggling but refuse to accept any form of help. He's not my only friend like this, there's a few but I'll point things out and say how unhealthy it is (I'm talking things that are signs of serious mental illness like skipping meals, constant nightmares, being overly obsessed with body image, etc) but they just don't listen and will shrug it off like it's not a big deal.",

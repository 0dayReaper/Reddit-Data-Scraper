    "postText": "Two weeks ago i (16 m) visited my father for the weekend. My parents are separated and i don\u2019t see my dad that often but i love him very much. While we were all walking around my grandpas farm, his dog ran into my baby brother and hurt him pretty badly. My dad was livid and i had never seen him this angry. He charged into the house and started yelling at my grandpa. When my grandpa started to defend the dog my dad suddenly rushed at him and started punching him. In front of all my baby cousins i had to grab his neck in a rear naked choke and pull him away from my grandpa.\n\nI had never seen my dad act that way and i still relive that moment and I remember his body squirming and trying to get away from me. I cant tell my mom either because then i wouldnt be able to go see my dad",

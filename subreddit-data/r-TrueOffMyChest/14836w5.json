    "postText": "I walked passed a group of women having some drinks and tapas. \n\nOne of the women said really loudly -LEAVE, you say that you can\u2019t stand your husband anymore, that he\u2019s abusive, that he\u2019s bad, that he treats you bad. Don\u2019t stay! Separate from him, or even better divorce. Go and live your life\u201d. \n\nI doubt she\u2019ll see my post, but your friend sounds like she\u2019s right. It\u2019s not always easy to leave, especially if you are financially dependent on him but in this case you are the one supporting him. I hope you find the strength to leave, I hope you find the strength to get a better life for your and your children. I hope you find happiness Maria",

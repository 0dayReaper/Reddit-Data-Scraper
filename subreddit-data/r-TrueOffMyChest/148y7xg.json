    "postText": "I got in trouble with my computer because I was looking at gay couple. I only looked it up because I wanted to look a pictures. But somebody reported me to the principal for what I was looking at on my computer and the person stated that it made them feel uncomfortable. I was called to the principals office. He went through my history on his computer. He sent me back to class but he did do a phone call home saying I was looking at inappropriate things. When I got home my mom asked me about it and I lied and fabricated the story and she eventually let it go. I was just wondering the whole time who told. I didn't know until weeks later. A girl I ride the bus with, she's in my Algebra class.\n\n She talked to me and told who it was and it was the girl I sit next to. And according to her, she said that she went up and told the teacher after class then she went and told the principal. I feel she was a snitch. She chose to look over at my screen. I wasn't shoving it in her face and the fact she told 2 people. I already know they monitor everyone's computers. The reason I didn't care of being caught, I've done so many bad things on the school computer and never been in trouble. The only reason I was here was because someone told. So her telling was unnecessary",

And like I said in the posts, I just searched up gay couples or gay related because I wanted to look at stock photos and images and those articles came with the pictures. I didn't read any of the articles. I had no intention of looking up how to practice gay sex, but that's the message it's giving to my principle. I think the reason she told was because it was mainly a gay couple. It's unknown if she saw the title article to the images.",

I did get a phone call home from the principal and he told my mom I was viewing pornography on the computer and he gave her a list of things he saw on my computer. And the reason why I say it kind of wasn't porn but it wasn't, because the images didn't show any of the sexual act but it was the articles which made it porn. Even though you don't look at the act, reading about it is the same thing. And when I got home from school my mom asked me about the call she got. I lied and fabricated the story and told something different and made stuff up. She eventually believed me and let it go. I was honestly surprised I didn't get in more trouble. I was expecting to get banned from using the computer for a month or have to get monitored, but none of that happened, just a phone call home.",

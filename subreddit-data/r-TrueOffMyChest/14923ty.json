    "postText": "hi guys im pretty upset right now so this might be a run on and rant.\n\ni (16F) got a job at a food chain 3/4 months ago, it\u2019s been really good overall but theres some things that have always bothered me. its not the corporation or my general managers fault, but my co workers.\n\nthere\u2019s a few incidents, and i\u2019ll start from the beginning.\n\nfor background(and not to be cocky) i think im good looking and my body is aswell.\n\nwhen i came in for orientation there was a conversation between 4 coworkers calling \u2018dubs\u2019 on new people. they were all over 18 and they said \u201cshe has the fattest ass shes so hot i call dibs\u201d. it bothered me but i didn\u2019t mind that much because it was funny at the time.\n\nnext situation was my second day, at the end of my shift a team lead told me \u201cim sorry but you have the fattest ass. i can\u2019t not look\u201d and it weirded me out.\n\nthen, my coworkers added me on snap. we will call him jake (18M) and he had been there a while. he talked to me and it made me quite uncomfy so i didn\u2019t respond. he never had the guts to look me in the eye but one day he asked me \u201cshow the angles right\u201d. i told some of my coworker friends but then it got out and people had started to ask me and i didn\u2019t lie. i said \u201cyeah he asked me but it\u2019s just weird.\u201d his friends told me tonight at work \u201cim sorry but i just don\u2019t believe that\u201d and i was astonished. i was coming forward about my coworker asking a minor for nudes and they \u2018didn\u2019t believe me\u2019?? they made me seem like i just wanted attention. i got upset and left the conversation, i said \u201cyou don\u2019t know how he is with girls\u201d and left. i felt so upset that it was being brushed over as a \u2018joke\u2019 or even not true. he denies it (obviously). i just am furious. why would i lie?\n\nalso, my manager, (19M), has recently started to snap me aswell. he flirts with me calling me pretty, telling me \u201cwhen do u get off i only talk to u!\u201d and things like that. im uncomfortable and everything\u2019s just piling on itself\n\nit sounds unrealistic but it\u2019s true. i want to quit and find a better paying, better workplace, and safer environment. i even had a vision of being raped because that\u2019s how uncomfortable i have gotten. i could go to management but it\u2019s useless because it\u2019s not going to work in my favor. im going to be told i\u2019m lying, called a snitch, or get fired.\n\nim going to find a new job before i quit, but i was wondering if i could get advice for people who might know a bit more than i do.",

            "comment": "Have you talked to your parents about any of this? I honestly feel they would want you to gtfo of there right now, not wait for another job. \n\nYou could reach through to corporate HR either way because I guarantee you're not the first one this has happened to and you won't be the last. This is harassment through and through and your managers are obviously too young and too poorly trained to be professional and respectful. This needs to be escalated higher up and you need to get out of that environment as soon as you can.\n\nDon't bother with your coworkers or management at the store, go to corporate. Maybe remove people from your snap or just don't use it for a while/uninstall it if you don't want confrontation about ignoring people there.\n\nSeriously though girl, get the hell out of there before something does happen. Talk to your parents or another adult you can trust to help and guide you through this if not your parents.",

As an adult I can tell you all of this is completely unacceptable and if you were my child I would want you to quit on the spot and not be subject to any of that. I get not wanting to start anything over it but on the same token as I said it's unacceptable. You could potentially make an anonymous complaint to HR but if you're uncomfortable with that I understand, either way I'm confident your parents will help you through this and get you somewhere better.\n\nAlways remember to know your worth, set your boundaries and protect yourself.\n\nI sincerely hope you find something else quickly and somewhere that you are treated with the respect you deserve and no harassment. Best of luck to you.",

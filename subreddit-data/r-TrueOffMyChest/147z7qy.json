    "postText": "Don't know if this is the right place to post this but I'm just ranting tbh. So I'm (28f) stuck in an ongoing quarrel between my coworkers (49f, 49f) and (45m). They have been arguing since before I even started working there and it has apparently been a problem since january this year. It is daily bullying in terms of shit talking, whispering behind eachothers backs, hiding information and in worst cases racism. I have several times heard one of the women say they \"wish he moves back to (\"home country\")\" and that she \"hopes he screwes up and gets deported\". I really dislike hearing these kinds of things and I can't say anything because the difference in social statuses at work. The 2 ladies have the boss on their side (I have spoken to our boss about this and thats how I noticed it, she really doesn't care/has any motivation to solve the situation). \n\nI also don't want to completely defend the guy in this because he is kind of an asshole and really isn't trustworthy in anything he does, lies, also hiding information, shit talks and in some way thinks he can control these 2 women by pushing strange suggestions and ideas. \n\nI've only been at my job for 2 months and I really like the actual job, just not any of my coworkers. I'm also getting the \"intern treatment\" where I'm constantly belittled, not heard, being told I can't ask for as high of a pay that they have (even though I have more related work experience in this field and the right education for the job, which they lack) since I'm too young (almost 30). They also have only worked there since january and I've smalltalked to them about their previous experiences. I just can't see how they started working together in january and immediately hated eachother. Both sides are trying to get me to talk badly about the other. I try my best to be professional and focus on the job. So far I've just tried changing the subject by asking something stupid or just acted like I wasn't listening. Is there anything I can do to make it stop? Do I quit even though I like the job? The constant negativity, bullying and hateful interactions are really getting to me and my patience. I kinda feel like I was catfished into taking this job since I was offered a good pay from the start without knowing of this situation.\n\nI have to clarify that the job requires alot of constant communication for safety reasons and I'm the messenger owl atm since they won't speak to eachother like normal people. There is also only 2 offices at the place and I don't have a desk yet so I can't really go anywhere but to where they're at...",

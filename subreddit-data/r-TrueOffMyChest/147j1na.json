            "comment": "Most people will tell you it\u2019s difficult to measure your calorie burn through exercise. Therefore tracking your eating is the best way to ensure calorie deficit. Eat between your 1507 to 1773 depending on your goals. I personally can\u2019t maintain a lb/week. I feel very tired and sleepy at the end of most days. \n\nFor the next two weeks, measure your weight on day 1. Pick a day and time to measure yourself in future periods. Should be the same each time. Example: Monday morning at 7 am before a glass of water. \n\nPick your food calorie goal. Track food daily through your app. Be honest. Use a scale to be accurate. Track for two weeks keep everything as is. Including your walking. \n\nNext Monday, weigh yourself. When you lose weight the first week, it\u2019s usually water weight.\n\nContinue for the second week and weigh again Monday. How much did you lose or gain? If you lost and feel fine daily, continue again for one more week.\n\nThe tip that helped me the most is to view this on a weekly basis. So for example, if you choose 1500 calories daily, that means 10,500 weekly. Even if you have one bad day, it\u2019s okay. As long as you stay close to the 10,500 on a weekly basis. It allowed me flexibility in food choices when I wanted to have a cheat meal. Some people will say \u201cdon\u2019t cheat\u201d. Whatever lol. I\u2019m not training for a competition or becoming an influencer.",

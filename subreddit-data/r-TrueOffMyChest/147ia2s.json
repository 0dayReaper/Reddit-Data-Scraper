    "postText": "So I\u2019m 23 \u2026 Female. I have had one child and he is 2 almost 3. Before this I always felt self conscious but now I really really am one of the many things is I feel I\u2019m very loose down there\u2026. Please no judgment, it\u2019s already hard enough to accept myself and so is this. I\u2019ve been hooking up with this guy for a couple months now (sex was great) now we can\u2019t a relationship. I feel the spark already is not there anymore because we have already had sex extremely good for a few times now and I feel it\u2019s over but we both want to continue (he never said anything about this topic) only I\u2019m thinking ab it and asking because I feel this way and I bet he does too. How do we keep the spark alive if we\u2019re gonna be ina long term relationship? Slow down on the sex? Ect? I don\u2019t feel confident and on my part that is a down fall obsly for me.. because I can\u2019t be comfortable or my true self be sexy ect. Well when we have sex a few days ago I noticed he has only been eatting me out and fingering me . He don\u2019t want me to suck his dck and he hasn\u2019t been f-ing me. I feel I\u2019m not attractive? When we did have vag sex last time I noticed he wasn\u2019t going in and out but like he was trying to hit the walls of my vag instead \u2026 obsly I know that means I\u2019m loose ect. It sucks\u2026. I hate it . Sometimes he will go for a couple mins then stop , move to my but (not even cum) but I do. He has came before tho but mot everytime and it makes me worry. He has went soft a few times but we have been drinking idk\u2026. He also speaks Spanish and hardly knows any English and vise versa for me (but we are working on it).. I thought a one night stan was gonna be at that but I really like him alot and from all this going on I\u2019m worried he is losing interest in me ..",

What about him like not just going straight in and out and hun trying to going into the side of my vagina walls if that makes sense? I know this relationship don\u2019t have to be serious but we both do wanna try and work towards it being that way, I asked him and he asked me and we both confirmed what we wanted. We laugh and have a good time ect it\u2019s just the language unfortunately but we\u2019re both trying to work on that and I know that it\u2019s not gonna happen overnight. I guess if things are meant they will be right.? if not, then they won\u2019t be \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n  You are right about not everyone person so gonna get off everytime during sex I always got to remember that but everytime he don\u2019t I always feel bad.. like I\u2019m not enough or something is wrong but I mean that\u2019s life and it happens. What would you suggest about the  sec thing? I think we been having it a lot and probably need to take a break and if the sex comes naturally one night we will go for it ect. I just don\u2019t know how to make it exciting, I feel overtime sleeping with me he is gonna want something different/new. I say this because it\u2019s all happened before. One reason my insecurities are like this unfortunately.. I def need to work on thsy",

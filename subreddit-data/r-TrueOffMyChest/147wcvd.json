    "postText": "My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 years this August. I have 4 children (f13,m11,m9,f7) and she has one child (m9). \nShe loves me unconditionally and meets every need that I have. She is the most selfless person I\u2019ve ever met. I would marry her today, anywhere in the world, except for one thing; her son. \n\nI cannot begin to describe the things that he does to agitate me and my children. Listening to them vent to me, and cry about the way he treats them is killing me. He says sociopathic things. One example which led to a huge argument between her and I was, \u201cif you don\u2019t give me the legos I will hit myself until I\u2019m red and tell your dad that you did it!\u201d My child came and told me about this statement, and I instantly saw red, asking her to leave and please take with her, until I could sort out my anger. \n\nHe is your classic bully. He does things when nobody is around, or watching essentially always creating a situation where it\u2019s his word against my children\u2019s. Although my kids have been teaming up, and making sure that when he does these things, one or more of them can verify the story. \n\nSince the first incident I mentioned above, which happened at our 6 month mark, she has put him in therapy and he sees her twice monthly. However, she doesn\u2019t allow myself to be a part of it. So I have no idea what\u2019s been said or discussed, except that the therapist was working with him on his triggers, and how to deal with people who make him upset. That seems ass backward to me, and I voiced that, which led to another argument. \n\nHer and I are both middle school teachers and I feel that we both have a great grasp on childhood behaviors. For some reason, I cannot look past his, hoping that someday he will grow out of it, but also wondering am I doing the wrong thing by staying and subjecting my children to this kid. \n\nI guess I\u2019m looking for advice, but also just wanted to type it out, and maybe help myself feel better about it.\n\n** edit - he is not like this all of the time. My children do have fun with him during normal play time, family outings, etc. We are constantly trying to help, my kids included.",

My son was diagnosed with ODD &amp; DMDD; it did not get any better, in fact it got WAY way worse for a long time.  He\u2019s 17 now and only now has it started to calm down a bit.\n\nIt is VERY hard to accept something is \u201cwrong\u201d or sinister or \u2018bad\u2019 about your child.  Its not an obvious disability or anything you even want to think about them.  My son was biting kids &amp; throwing chairs at 2 years old, I thought that was the terrible twos, no one ever told me there could be something more serious.  I didn\u2019t get him therapy or an eventual diagnosis until he was about 10.  That was too late; soon he was taller than me, refusing to take his meds, refusing to get in the car to go to therapy\u2026 he wasn\u2019t as agreeable to treatment as he would\u2019ve been in his younger years.",

My mom and him had 2 kids together and he purposely left me out of things and would go out of his way to make my life hell. Example: \u201caccidentally\u201d forgetting to pick me up from school or \u201cconveniently\u201d having to stay at work longer so my mom had no car. Leaving me to walk 5+ miles home in the desert sun through the ghetto when I was barely 10. ( I later found out that when he was at work after hours he was actually just chillin in the parking lot drinking beer)Purposely spending my child support money on beer and his kids so I wouldn\u2019t have school supplies. Purposely leave for hours on end so I would have to stay home and watch my asshole brothers and I would miss out on doing things for after school. Along with missing out on hanging out with friends. My mom saw the abuse and did absolutely nothing and I hated her for it. When I was a teen I finally broke because I could no longer live under the same roof as him. I told her about the sexual abuse, hoping to god she would finally stand up for me. She looked me dead in the face and asked if it was actually my own father who did it. I said no and she then asked \u201care you sure?\u201d Again I said no. She then turned around and left and closed the door behind her\u2026.. I\u2019m 33 now and still remember pain that shot through my entire body that I fell to my knees sobbing. I didn\u2019t see or hear from her the rest of the night. I hated her. I hated how she chose that monster over me for 10 plus years. She saw first hand how he treated me and did absolutely nothing, but drank herself into a stupor and hide in her room. From the age of 8-10 he would be so bold as to grope me in front of her in passing. Like he was giving me a high 5 or some shit. I have a daughter of my own and would go to the ends of the earth for her. Because of what I endured, I vowed that I would never pick a man over my child. Never subject them to any type of abuse that is 100% preventable. And never turn a blind eye to things because I love that person. No man is worth my daughter\u2019s happiness and wellbeing. I would gladly sacrifice love and my feelings if it meant my daughter was safe. Fortunately my husband is a godsend and we have a wonderful relationship and still going strong after 15 years. I tried to have a relationship with my mother\u2026. Unfortunately her needs and wants have always out weighed what she needed to do for her kids. OP, do what is needed for the sake of your children. I wish dearly you weren\u2019t in this position and I hope this situation can be solved. Don\u2019t let your kids become collateral damage.",

If the roles were reversed, she would surely choose her son over you. \n\nAnd saying \"oh it only happens once in a while\" is a terrible excuse. Once is enough. And you staying in their relationship means that you are enabling future incidents to happen. \n\nReddit is full of teenagers and young adults who resent and outright hate their parents because they (parents) chose their significant others over their own children.\n\nEdit: Your edit makes it sound worse.

Being a part of these conversations more often, or almost always, may help a lot. \n\nThis may create a bit of a \u201cmom vs new dad\u201d type of dynamic in his mind since you\u2019re not a part of that conversation. You two need to be closer aligned in your actions. \n\nNot like she\u2019s likely secretly high fiving him and saying \u201cthat my boy, a natural little piece of shit!\u201d Lol, but more so she\u2019s probably way to soft on him and that\u2019s part of the reason he doesn\u2019t care about his actions because mommy won\u2019t do anything. \n\nI used to be a teacher, it\u2019s just like those kids in school. Most kids are decent enough and they\u2019ll listen well enough. Some kids just don\u2019t care unless they\u2019ll get in \u201ca lot of trouble\u201d, or even then barely care.\n\nSeems like you have another option to try, and since you love her that much, I think you should try what I said here. On top of what others might have said that\u2019s solid advice before you take action to break up. Idk, this is the only other comment I read.",

This is exactly what he needs. You could tell your girlfriend you'll give it a couple of months (or whatever you think) to see if the child is learning.\nThere is a trick I've learnt when it comes to a child in my care that I can't take to. I imagine that I think he/she is the most amazing person in the world, and I look at them like that. The response is always positive and they tend to bring their behaviour up to match what they believe I think of them. It could be worth a try.\nAlso, have a chat to your kids and get their honest opinion on your relationship. And definitely encourage them to build boundaries and follow through. It's fine for them to say \"you can play with us as long as you....\" and then if he acts inappropriately, reinforce the rule \"we're not playing with you now because you....\" and walk away",

OP, the fact that she will not allow you into her son's therapy sessions with her is a very big statement on her part. ...Based on what you described, she has badly botched her parenting job w him. And she does not seem to experience any \"oneness\" with you as a functional co-parent, day-to-day. \n\nAnd, of course (and as others have pointed out), your kids come first. There is no shielding children from a live-in sociopath or psychopath. And most are \"not like that all the time.\" (If they were, it would blow their cover.) The mother seems willfully oblivious, and won't let you effectively help. \n\nHer series of actions seem to dictate your upcoming ones. ...I'm really sorry for your torment and pain over this, OP. \n\nWhen it's all over, take your kids somewhere fun and restorative.

They do this with kids with all different types of behavioral and/or personality disorders.  One of my friends had her son tested and he has ODD, so he sees a psychologist &amp; is on meds.  At one point they had told her that untreated, he could grow into a sociopath\u2026so that kinda pushed her a bit to get him help.  \n\nI would try suggesting something like this before ending things.

If she doesn\u2019t want you involved in this, then ending it may be your only choice.  She has to understand your concern for your kids.

That's incredibly sensible of her. You complain that you are not kept in a tight enough loop with the therapy, which I find absolutely unsurprising considering that you disagree with the way the therapist is approaching the problem and are too angry at the kid when issues arise to act as a functioning father figure to him. The later of which might actually be setting an example for the kids behaviour in addition to being a total red flag for you to be involved in his treatment in any form.\n\nBeing integrated into a large family can be really stressful for a child and it sounds a lot like the kid doesn't have appropriate strategies to interact successfully in his new environment. What the therapist means by \"dealing with other people\" is teaching interaction strategies with others that don't resort to violence or threats to achieve compromises that everyone is happy with, while the \"managing emotion\" part is him being able to be happy with those compromises. If this isn't an acceptable state of affairs for you then that would mean that you don't see the boy as an equal party to your own kids. If you're trying to actually form a family this is completely unacceptable.\n\nThe questions you have to ask yourself are: Can you overcome your anger and be a good father to that boy and how would you want to be treated by your significant other if one of your children happened to be the problem child and how would you want your significant other to treat your child in that case.",

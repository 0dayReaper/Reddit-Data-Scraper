    "postText": "Imagine buying a bottle of gorilla glue. You go through the checkout, pay the money to make the bottle your property, and take it home. You aren't sure what you'll do with it yet, but there'll probably be something down the line that will break, and that will be the time to triumphantly whip out the Gorilla Glue.\n\nOne day, you run out of hairspray. That is unfortunate, since your hair is unruly and requires some serious hold just to stay in place. You think about alternatives, but there aren't any that come to mind.\n\nAnd then, you think back to the Gorilla Glue.\n\nPutting Gorilla Glue on your hair is absolutely fucking stupid. The woman picked up a bottle that literally says 'For the toughest jobs on planet Earth', and 'Bonds virtually everything', that is made for use on stone and metal among other things. And she put it in her fucking hair. She says 'It\u2019s not \\[her\\] choice, no, it\u2019s not \\[her\\] choice' but it so clearly was. She wasn't forced to put it on, she made the conscious decision to apply it. That quote shows so much immaturity, she just can't seem to accept that she fucked up and that this is her fault.\n\n~~She's trying to sue the company now. Apparently, the warnings about contact with skin and eyes can't be reasonably extended to application on hair.  But if you need a warning to not put super glue in your hair, you should probably stay away from DIY products. This is absolutely not the company's fault. It's the fault of one fucking insipid woman who has less common sense than a QAnoner. That would be an impressive title, if her actions weren't so immature and plain stupid.~~ That was wrong, blame whoever wrote the Gorilla Glue Wikipedia page or something\n\nPeople are offering free treatment for her. I am an advocate for free, universal healthcare, but doctors should spend their time and resources battling COVID and cancer, not helping some childish TikTok girl who can't read that Gorilla Glue is moisture proof and permanent.\n\nI cannot find the words to explain just how annoyed I am that she is getting this much attention for being so unfathomably stupid. She deserves nobody's sympathy, and if she wants it to be fixed, she should cut her hair off and let it regrow. I am usually a rather sympathetic person, but I feel nothing except embarrassment and frustration when people try and use their own poor judgement and awful decision making skills to put themselves in a position where people will give them attention for a few weeks. Especially when they have a lack of self awareness gaping enough to beg for money and treatment when she should just grow up and deal with it herself.\n\nThe worst part is that she'll probably end up with a following from this. People will see the Gorilla Glue girl and think 'Yeah, I'm gonna keep watching her TikToks'. We shouldn't reward idiots like her, as it only encourages more idiocy in the future.\n\nWhat a fucking cretin.\n\nEdit: apparently, according to u/hannahclipse she isn't actually seeking legal action. Just thought I'd put that on the record.\n\nEdit 2: thought I should mention that, if she wanted it to be a private matter, she shouldn't have fucking posted it on social media. Anything that you post on social media could blow up unexpectedly (including this, I didn't think it would get this far), and you need to take that into account when posting stuff like she did.\n\nEdit 3: to anyone who has said or wants to say something along the lines of 'bad take', just shut the fuck up. This sub isn't r/ratemytake or some shit. If you have something helpful or interesting to say, say it. But take your asinine, low-effort 'bad take' comments elsewhere. They add nothing to the discussion and they make you look like you have nothing intelligent to say.\n\nEdit 4: to the people saying that this is too harsh over a mistake, I say this: I would understand if it was a 16 year old girl or something doing this, as you do stupid stuff as a teenager and you learn from it. But the 'Gorilla Glue girl' is a 40 year old woman. She has lived for 40 years on this earth, owns two businesses and is a mother. She should have enough common sense not to put super glue in her hair, or post it on the Internet where everyone can see her mistake, for that matter.\n\nEdit 5: the Gorilla Glue girl made $10k in donations for some wigs to cover her shameful mistake. Many cancer patients can only dream of having enough money to afford rent and food after their medical debts, let alone such vanity as having a wig to cover the effects of their chemotherapy. Anyone who donated to her was fucking scammed.\n\nEdit 6: it's at $19k by now. [Here's the page](https://www.gofundme.com/f/gorilla-glue-girl) if you want to see how much she's profiting from her TikTok tantrum.",

            "comment": "PLEASE DO NOT compare this case to the McDonalds Coffee case. When I say they are 100% different. I mean it.\n\n I studied this case extensively in my Torts class in law school. I went from thinking 'people are so stupid' to...'FUCK MCDONALDS! MAKE THEM PAY!'\n\nWhat McDonald's did was shitty AF. \n\nThey had been warned by their own quality assurance specialists that their coffee would burn on contact, other food at that temperature would have been unabel to serve because it would have been a food hazard. 700 people had sued in the previous years for burn injuries.\n\nThe victim was a tiny 79 year old lady, when the coffee fell on her lap, she was wearing cotton sweatpants that absorbed the coffee and held it against her skin, scalding her thighs, buttocks, and pelvic region. She required skin grafts for all of her thighs and her pelvic region. She had THIRD degree burns.. when she left the hospital, she was 83 pounds. She was essentially disabled and needed medical treatment for the next 2 years.\n\nShe didn't ask for a bunch of money, she asked that McDonald's help pay some of her medical bills...she asked for a few thousand dollars. McDonald's wouldn't budge. So when they went to court, the jury was so pissed off, they punished McDonalds through the damages.",

She tells the doctor she's allergic to it. The doctor say, \"That's ridiculous, I've been a doctor for 30 years and have never heard of anyone that's allergic to this. You don't know what you're talking about,\" then proceeds to inject her.\n\nTurns out she was allergic to it, and suffered chronic headaches among other injuries.\n\nIn the lawsuit, she sought lost wages. Her job was a fortune teller.\n\nNaturally, the headlines for that case were along the lines of, \"Woman loses psychic powers after CT, sues doctor.\" \n\n\nAnd with the McDonalds case, didn't it end up getting reversed on appeal so she ended up with nothing?\n\nEdit: The McDonalds verdict was reduced by the trial court through remitter, not appeal, and then settled for a confidential amount.\n\nHere's some more info on the physic case (no idea the credibility of the source): https://sciencecorruption.com/ATN172/00678.html\n\nAnd here's reddit parroting the tort-reformist talking-points about it: https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/23dxny/til_a_woman_sued_a_hospital_claiming_a_cat_scan/",

At that particular location, there was a group of older people that would come in frequently in the morning and stick around a couple hours chatting, doing old people stuff, etc, ending up each having more than 1-2 cups of coffee. Manager got annoyed and decided to keep the coffee heated to extreme temps so these customers had to drink it much more slowly.\n\nKeep at near boiling temps so old people can't run you out of house and home (/s obviously) by drinking MULTIPLE cups of $0.55 senior coffee.\n\nAnd yes, I believe $0.55 really was the actual price of a senior coffee at the time.",

It's not that they had to add it on for stupid people. It's because of the requirements for allergy labels. If we made an exception for that, we'd have to start making exceptions for other things. It's easier to blanket require all of it, no matter how obvious, than to make a long list of what doesn't need the label.",

Lots of judgement calls to be made because you can avoid labeling something if you have a documented justification for why the product shouldn't put someone over the listed exposure limit.  (E.g. you would need to eat 15 of these plastic caps to exceed daily exposure and you shouldn't even eat one).\n\nProblem is that justification writes take time when you have thousands of products and every write up involves some minor level of risk that the litigation hunting lawyers might bring cases against you.  The easiest thing to do is just take your bill of materials list and say \"add Prop65 labels if these substances are present anywhere in the finished product\"",

And so I got thinking in other ways. And perhaps the first example that came to mind was that it was quite a while until I knew that Hard Lemonade had alcohol in it. To me, I was just confused when I saw all these ads out for Mike's and was like \"Man. People must really like lemonade?\" Or when you have imitation foods becoming more common like the \"Beyond Burger\" or other things that are made to look and taste like something they aren't. \n\nSo even going forward I could imagine things coming along like the \"peanut-free peanut butter\" or other products of the ilk that could eventually cause legitimate confusion for those not familiar with the product as to what it actually contains.

Because that one is called glue, she figured gorilla glue would do nearly the same. The gorilla glue was actually in a spray can form that is similar to her hairspray bottle. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t an accident. But it also wasn\u2019t her taking a bottle of liquid gorilla glue and lathering that on her head hoping for the best. \n\nSuing is stupid because she is an idiot. However having that shit on your head I imagine could actually cause damage. I\u2019m not certain, but your hair is still trying to grow under there and that could lead to pain or ingrown hairs all over her head which would mean tons of infections and serious medical problems. \n\nRaising money for medical treatment is fine imo. Raising money to sue the company makes her look like an idiot even more.",

She didn\u2019t slip and fall in a puddle of gorilla glue but on that same note - it wasn\u2019t on purpose in the sense that she understood it to be actual super glue. She mistook it because the brand she uses also has glue in the title and this aerosol version of gorilla glue was nearby. \n\nShe did it on purpose, but she didn\u2019t use actual glue intentionally knowing that it was glue. It\u2019s a subtle but, I think, important distinction.",

Honestly the more idiotic a mistake makes you look, the WORSE I feel for you.  You're having a shitty time due to the consequences of whatever happened, AND to get help you have to reveal that you were a moron? That's a double whammy. It's like those people that have to go to the hospital to get something \"not asshole approved\" from their anus because they did something dumb while horny and not thinking straight. That's physically painful AND embarrassing because it's fucking depraved and stupid. And I'd still feel bad for that person, and still not call them \"scum\" or \"below human\" for wanting help and not dying of shame alone lmao. The girl posted a video asking for advice and then when the internet couldn't help and asked for updates about the hospital, she provided. The HORROR, what a *scumbag* lol.\n\nI'm assuming OP and everyone else in this thread have NEVER done anything stupid and then gotten comforted by a friend or family member, despite it being stupid, because they cared. Because that's basically all that's happening and it's all very normal.\n\nLike what is wrong with OP and this type of person where they wake and think \"you know what pisses me off about the world today???? All the SYMPATHY and HUMAN COMPASSION non-perfect people get. THAT, on this entire planet of rape and murder and pain, is what I'm mad about and need to shit talk.\" I cannot even imagine the perfect, cushy life you would have to live to be a pissed off by human kindness.\n\nSympathy and kindness isn't a zero sum game. You don't give it to people who \"earn\" it in a highly competitive game or something. It's literally just a fucking feeling. You either feel it for something or you don't. And it's not a zero sum game either. Giving it to one person isn't deleting it from someone else's stash. There's no need for the sympathy and kindness police to ration out who gets it.\n\n/u/UncivilPizza\n\nEDIT: stop responding to this comment with \"lol putting that shit in your hair is stupid\". I already said it was fucking stupid, I just also said that OP and others are losers *for shitting on people for* *being nice to her about it.* Both can be true. \n\nOh also I'm not responding to you.",

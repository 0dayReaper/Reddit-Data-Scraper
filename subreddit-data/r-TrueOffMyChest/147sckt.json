    "postText": "Hi all. I wanted to post this somewhere I'd hope my school wouldn't see.\n\nMy teacher is a primarily digital media teacher. She specializes in photoshop, and we usually used high quality computers.\n\nMy school suffered from a severe fire back in May, so unfortunately we've been in online school and thus a lot of kids have been interacting a lot less.\n\nIn the beginning, a lot of kids would ignore her or just not respond whatsoever. I could tell she was passionate about the subject and enjoyed doing this kind of work, but it honestly hurt to hear her sound so stressed and demotivated from everyone just not responding.\n\nIt got to the point where she would ask people if they could hear her because she assumed her computer wasn't working and it wasn't picking up her voice.\n\nI've never been big in digital media and I wasn't really that engaged to be honest, but I very much so know the pain of being ignored and dismissed once you're passionate about something. So I would talk to her, let her know we could hear and would compliment the subject, talk about how cool it was turning out and how interesting it was.\n\nI could hear her light up and become cheerful about the subject again; I became basically the carrier of the class and I would do the project on my drawing tablet, following along and actually enjoying myself as I did so. Hearing her enjoy her job again was everything to me.\n\nEventually, other kids started engaging too again, I don't know if it was because of me or just because the school year is ending and we are on our final, but she seemed like she felt a lot better. Teachers are humans too and I've always been the one to make their job easier and give them the benefit of the doubt, and this time it felt especially rewarding.\n\nI'm in a therapy school for kids with depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc. so I definitely understand why the others would be shy and demotivated, but I didn't wanna just sit around and hear her essentially talk to silence. I'm just happy she can explore something she enjoys, even if she has to use something as low quality as Photopea because our school Chromebooks don't personally have Photoshop lol.",

But outside of class I always heard people talking shit about him, saying how horrible and cruel he was, and called him names for his Santa-like appearance. I did not understand why as he was such a great guy and I honestly thought of him as the grandpa I never had. I made sure to engage with him and let him know that not everyone feels about him like that. It\u2019s great to see there\u2019s others who feel the same as me :)",

A lot of time, nice people feel like shit for setting up boundaries, and the fact that you internalized how to do this at 16 gives you a huge leg up in interpersonal relationships. I think it's important to treat people with kindness and empathy without letting them walk all over you. \n\nI hope you continue trusting your gut. Based on your comments in this thread, you've learned a lot of lessons that I've only learned in my late 20s. Also, depression/anxiety/PTSD fucking sucks and I know how often it can make you feel worthless even if intellectually you know you're not. From one stranger to another, next time those voices come up -- maybe remember this thread. All the people giving you compliments are doing so for a reason. Never stop learning. \n\nIf you keep up with the attitude youve shown in this thread, you'll do great in life. You'll have failures, but don't let them define you or stop you. Good luck.",

I'm glad it meant something to you.\n\n&gt;I'm pretty sure they're convinced I'm going to fuck up my life as much as they did; they became narcissists, alcoholics, constantly losing friendships because of their toxicity, getting DUIs, losing jobs, and this gives me hope I won't be like that. :)\n\n&gt;my family LOVES to put us down for being children and make sure we feel stupid for being young all the time, and tell us nonstop how we know \"nothing about how the world works\".\n\nIt is so hard, isn't it? It's incredibly hard to internalize the idea that your teachers/parents are people too and just because they are in a position of authority over you doesn't mean they know everything, or don't have emotional problems or even that they know how to help you. \n\nUnfortunately, I've seen this (your family's behaviour) a lot. They are subconsciously scared that you are right. That a 16yo \"child\" is smarter than them, that she will make something out of herself, that she'll have better relationships. It's scary because just ten years ago you were a tiny little girl who relied on them for everything, but now they see an independent person who is doing better at being a good human being than they ever were. It is an extremely humbling experience for both good and bad parents. The difference is that good parents will be humbled but will be *proud* of you for surpassing them. Shitty parents will see it as a challenge. They'll do everything they can to drag you down to their level. After all, if you surpass them, they no longer have any excuse for fucking up their own lives. I'm happy you recognise that. Whatever path you took that is leading to these realizations, just keep taking it. Shitty people will always drag you down to their level because it is in their ego's self-interest that you don't succeed. I'm glad you're not letting them.\n\nI skimmed through your profile and you wrote in one of your posts:\n\n&gt;I swear, when I'm a mother I will end this cycle once and for all.\n\nEven the most well-intentioned people struggle so much with this and sometimes give up because they're not perfect. Don't be afraid if you have setbacks. Nobody is a perfect parent. Do the best you can, and be proud of yourself for being strong enough to try!",

Whether you go into post secondary education, or vocational training, all educators just want to know they're engaging their students and that things are getting through! At the university level if you're willing to engage you'll get professors really willing to go to bat for you, or perhaps mentors and trainers willing to connect you to an industry professional. It's a great attitude all around, and don't worry it's not just teens. The same thing happens in undergrad and grad school, where people are paying tens of thousands of dollars to be there and then not engage at all \ud83e\udd23 I totally understand it's awkward, but omg the relief when a student is actually interested and asking questions!!!",

She is the only kid going and basically gets a private lesson. \nGreat for her grades but she feels so bad knowing that next year nobody will show up...

            "comment": "It happened to me too in offline classes before lockdown. We had a new math teacher. She was used to teaching college students but due to some family matters had to teach us, high school students. But she was really passionate about it and sometimes went off track to teach us higher class topics. At first, nobody paid attention to her and only I did. She took it really well and I was easily the one she asked to answer the questions. This went on until a few months later, when more and more students started responding to her and it became a popular class. But gradually I stopped paying attention as much as I did at first. then I no longer became a star student. This scenario has happened to me many times.",

I ended up learning algebra really well and engaged most of the time during the class. I did fail the first half of the course although I'd ace my tests and participate, but it was mainly because I would never do homework. He was the one that told me \"you know what your problem is? You are extremely intelligent, but lazy.\" That really struck a cord with me and after that, I'd always do my best in his class as well as other courses, so I guess we helped each other out.",

    "postText": "Last night I ordered a pizza as my boyfriend was out of town and I was feeling lazy. Older gentleman delivered the pizza and started saying things like \"are you wearing anything under your clothes?\" \"Do you live alone? Is anyone in your apartment?\" \"I like you, youre very sexy.\". Right at the end he tried to hug me and kissed me on the forehead. I was wildly uncomfortable and I kept waking up to car sounds in the parking lot, checking that it wasn't him. I slept with a bat. I do not like to rock the boat. I'm very nonconfrontational. But I reported him to DoorDash. They just called and told me they are so sorry, there is a zero tolerance policy on that sort of behavior, and they have deactivated his account.\n\nI'm glad I reported him. He might have done something worse in the future to another woman. But I feel like trash that I got a guy fired. Weird dissonance in my head right now.",

Ultimately it only perpetuates the problem by allowing harmful behavior to continue without consequences.\n\nLet's be real, though: the odds that someone like that has kids is pretty low given his personality ;D",

Look around each room and figure out what you can use as an impromptu weapon should the bat not be useable at the time. Think about things like knives and such, yes, but also things people wouldn\u2019t expect like ink pens and pencils as stabbing weapons, utensils like forks and knives, pictures or clocks you can smash over peoples heads etc.",

My love passed away May of 2020, and starting pretty quickly an old friend of mine (20 years my senior) started trying to hit on me. I am ALWAYS completely up front about not being interested, as I tend to get along better with males so I've got more male friends, and I don't like stuff to be weird. It's an awkward conversation to have, bluntly telling people you aren't interested, but I just figure it saves the hassle. It didn't matter how many times I told this man though, he would constantly bring it up in passive aggressive ways until he actually started trying to fucking lay guilt trips on me about it (which at times, I DID have guilt) I cut him off completely, and have went on to deal with at least 2-3 more similar sitiations. I did not deal with this shit even close to this extent before I lost my man, really don't understand why so much now, but at 33 I'm 100% sure I want to be single from here on out. \n\nI just cannot believe the audacity. Some nasty people out there (like the guy in your situation it sounds like) I feel like legitimately think they are entitled to other PEOPLE. what the fuck is happening in this world? Really sorry that happened to you, and I hope you've been able to shake off the lasting discomfort from it. You 100% did the right thing, this man was putting his hands on you! He very well could have went on to go further and rape a customer...so you very well could have just SAVED someone. Its not easy to do something like that, so be proud of yourself!\n\nThis is also a big part of why I tell them to drop my food and knock...I might stick to that option in the future! Good luck!",

A manager at the gas station by my house used to hit on me constantly, even standing in front of the doors so I couldn\u2019t leave until he was done making his requests.\n\nI\u2019m also non-confrontational, so I just gritted my teeth and bore it.  Then one day I pushed past him to get out of there and pump my gas and he followed me to the pump and stood there hitting on me until I was finished.  When I tried to get back into my car and leave, he stood in front of my door so I couldn\u2019t open it and kept me there for at least 5 minutes while he said some very inappropriate things to me. \n\nI called and spoke to his district manager, who basically told me that I should take it as a compliment and that he didn\u2019t see anything wrong with it.\n\nI came in that night and spoke to the girl working about it.  She said he treats his workers the same way and that him and the district manager were both super misogynistic and sexist toward women.\n\nI called the stations corporate office and spoke to the head of their HR department.  She said they would investigate the report and let me know about the outcome.\n\nLess than 3 hours later she called and told me they found my report to be true. She also said she was surprised I\u2019m the only woman who called to report it, as he was doing the same thing to several women who frequented the establishment.\n\nIn any case he was let go immediately, and his district manager was too.  She thanked me for letting them know, and three female workers there also thanked me for reporting him. \n\nIt was a good day.  You shouldn\u2019t feel bad for what you did because his actions were way out of line.  Keep your head up, and keep your eyes open for that guy.  Since he knows where you live I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you didn\u2019t feel safe.\n\nEDIT for grammar and to say you should not feel guilty in any way.  If he can\u2019t control himself with ladies he shouldn\u2019t be working, and he definitely shouldn\u2019t be trusted with a woman\u2019s address information!\n\nEDIT 2 to say I\u2019m extremely grateful that the head of their HR department was a woman.  I shudder to imagine that had it been a man my complaint might not have been taken so seriously.  Just like the district manager who had no problem with it, some men just don\u2019t see that stuff as the problem it is.",

There is no way people don't know what they're doing. This was not only inappropriate, but sinister because he was asking questions that basically asked if she was alone and ready to be raped or murdered. People need to understand these questions and know how to answer them in a detecting way. \n\nQ: \"Are you alone?\" \nA: \"My husband and his friend are in the game room\"\n\nIf you are on vacation and Uber drivers ask you questions, it may seem like they are just making small talk, sure a lot of them are, but some are fishing.\n\n\"How long you guys out here?\" \"Where are you staying?\" \"Just you guys?\" \"Going somewhere tonight?\" All leading questions to get you to tell them information they want.\n\nYou're alone, you're unarmed and vulnerable, you are going out at a certain time, you are staying at a certain place.\n\nIf you aren't staying at a hotel and are staying at a BNB and HAVE TO for some reason have an Uber driver drop you off,  ALWAYS, even unprovoked, mention that \"everyone is there waiting for you\"\n\nThey can show up later or take you out right away. Kidnapping, rape, trafficking, murder, burglary, whatever their intentions. Don't give them the information they want. Be smart and aware about how you answer these questions.\n\nYour Uber or Taxi driver or Door dash person may be just an ordinary innocent person, but you will never see them again and they are not your friend. So be friendly, but don't be honest. Protect yourself and your family/friends/loved ones.\n\nAlso, if you are staying at a BNB, a lot of the time the host is there in the house in a secret room waiting for you to check out and they tell you, but they do it after you booked it, very briefly within a gigantic wall of text. They could pick you randomly to be the one they fuck up if it's just you or just you and a spouse.\n\nAlways always always book BNBs with    hundreds of high rated reviews, familiar, with very close neighbor houses, and with at least one other couple. ALWAYS stay with friends if you BNB.\n\nDon't assume you are safe because the potential attackers see you with a man. Attackers often kill the man first before doing whatever it is they have planned for the woman.\n\nI know this last bit is controversial, but I also highly recommend that you have something for self defense that you are proficient enough with to defend yourself against a firearm. Usually, a firearm itself if you aren't traveling and can have one legally. But always know how to use them inside and out, keep them safe away from children and guests but accessible to you and only you in a literal instant. One thing to know is the attacker is very likely not going to shoot you right away. That's when you don't hesitate. They didn't care about your life when they attacked you, they made a decision to hurt, torture, or kill you. They forfeited their life when they planned to take yours. Pull the trigger. If you don't have a firearm always always always keep that to yourself and imply or even lie that you have a few. Not one but a few.",

I could tell they were in the apartment complex but seemed to be driving around, I tried to call whatever number was listed on the app to give them some help (complex can be confusing) and got an auto message that the number  was disconnected. \n\nwhen they finally found the spot they message and   asked me to meet them at the car. Ok fine nothing crazy \n\n\nThis is when it got weird. The food was on his passengers seat. But he wasn\u2019t saying or doing anything. The window was rolled down as if he like expected me to reach in and grab it or open the door? \n\nThat  when I became very sketched out. My gut told me to not go back into my apartment because he could clearly  see which one I was going into, but due to the app he already had my Apt number anyway. \n\nSo I went back inside, texted my partner that I just felt sketched out and wanted him to know, and sent a screen shot of the driver info. \n\nI didn\u2019t fell like I could report anything because he didn\u2019t DO anything.\n\nThen about an hour passes and I see a similar car go through  the lot. Again just think I\u2019m paranoid nothing happens immediately. Then I hear something slam near my door. I\u2019m in the corner where someone\u2019s door is 2\u201d away from mine so it\u2019s not unheard of for me to hear them come in. \n\nThen I hear the handle jingle . Like someone\u2019s trying to get in. I go full home alone  at this point.\n\nI set up my mirror in a way where I can see down the hallway to the front door from my living room.  \n\n30mins go by it happens again, this time I SEE the door knob move and then I hear banging on it. Lasts maybe 2mins. I stay basically frozen on the couch until I think they\u2019re gone. \n\nThen I tie up my door so you can\u2019t pull it open from the outside even if you can get it unlocked, or at the least you\u2019d have one hell of a time getting in. Go get my gun, and just sat on the couch. \n\n\nI called the cops, because even if it\u2019s not the delivery guy, *someone* is trying to get in.  Unfortunately they can\u2019t do anything because a crime hadn\u2019t been committed yet.  \n\nThere\u2019s a police station 3 blocks down, I know there is a cop who lived in the complex (I see the car) so at the least I was hoping someone would drive by.\n\n\nI report him to the delivery services, I tell them about the behavior and how I cant prove it\u2019s him but it was just very weird situation All around. At the least flag his account so if someone does report him there\u2019s a record.. \n\n\nI have no idea if this man has done anything else to another woman.. point is you did the right thing. I think part of \u201csilencing victims\u201d is putting guilt in them. \u201cYou got someone fired\u201d no they got themselves fired.\n\nThat behavior is inappropriate and one of the reasons they continue to do this ti people is because  no one is holding them accountable for that behavior.",

I contacted Uber and I was told his account was deactivated. Don\u2019t feel guilty for these sick weirdos that try to find opportunities to act out on their sick  behavior.",

There is this really bad teacher. You know complaining will probably get him suspended or make him lose his job.\n\nBut truth is: if you don\u2019t tell anyone he is a terrible teacher, nothing will ever change.\n\nAnd the future classes that come before you will end up having the same shitty experience you had.\n\nSure, you already lost (he wasn\u2019t able to teach you what he should have), and he will loose as well (his job) but several students will gain something from your act (they will not have their classes with this teacher).\n\nThing is: it is the offender\u2019s fault (the teacher and the delivery man) for putting their job on the line. Not yours.\nIf that job was so important to them, they should have taken care and make it right.\n\nSo don\u2019t feel guilt, what you\u2019ve done is good. Maybe not for you.

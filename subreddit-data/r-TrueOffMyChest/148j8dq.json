It could be a song, a movie, an outfit, or seeing a specific person. Even going to a specific place. \n\nI have triggers and I hate it, primarily because \"trigger\" is thrown around casually today by people online and IRL telling you to not be triggered. I'm ashamed of telling people I have triggers and I am working on it. \n\nThis is what happens when something legitimate is thrown around as a poking insult. People have zero self awareness.",

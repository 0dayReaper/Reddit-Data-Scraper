    "postText": "For context: My aunt loves to brag about how successful and wealthy she\u2019s become and passed her money is everything mentality to her kids. My family is by no means wealthy, but we\u2019re \u201crich in love\u201d as my mom likes to put it. We live a quiet and modest lifestyle. (I.e we live in a quiet run down rural town)\n\nRecently I and my husband attended a (formal, relevant later) wedding of a family member with my parents. We were seated at the same table as my aunt and her family at the reception. My first issue is that they purposely came extremely underdressed (we\u2019re talking blue jeans and graphic T shirts) and on top of this, if you held conversation with them for longer than 10 seconds they made it clear that they didn\u2019t want to attend at all. Fine, fine. Annoying? Yes, but manageable. (At least they came, they didn\u2019t come to my, nor my sister\u2019s weddings)\n\nLater in the night my husband and I needed some fresh air so we walked to our car. My cousin (aunts teen kid) saw us and followed us out. While outside we tried to keep some polite conversation with her. (big mistake) After catching up on what\u2019s new with hubby and I (we\u2019re buying a house Wooo!) I ask about what they plan to do after high school.(they graduate next year) To which they stick their nose up at us and go on about how they plan to buy a house right out of high school and find an apprenticeship for woodworking. I (still trying to stay civil even though they\u2019re already rude and dismissive ) ask about what kind of woodworking they were interested in. (Kitchen remodeling and furniture) Cool right? I thought so. I told her once she starts working I\u2019d love to hire her for some cabinetry for our kitchen. (I know how much work it is and fully expected to pay full price for her services) She laughs in our face and tells us \u201cShe\u2019s too expensive for what we could probably afford.\u201d Mind that she has no experience and thought it was \u201ccute\u201d that I\u2019m buying a house at 24? What? That\u2019s something my husband and I are extremely proud of and have been working towards for years. (We met and started dating at 18 and married at 22)\n\nI wish I could say that was the only time we\u2019ve had these kinds of interactions, but even for Thanksgiving we are expected to go to their house and mom and I cook dinner because \u201cour house isn\u2019t as nice as theirs but we cook better.\u201d \n\nI think I\u2019ve finally run out of patience. I\u2019m tired of being looked down on because my mom prioritized family over anything else. Like I\u2019m lesser because I was raised to be humble and to not believe money is everything. I\u2019m perfectly happy in my cozy little house with my loving husband and fur babies. I have everything could I need right here. But I definitely understand why my moms other siblings have been low contact with aunt for a couple years now. I think I\u2019ll be following their example and know it may be time to just walk away. \n\nI wrote this on mobile so please forgive any weird formatting. I just needed to get this whole situation off my chest. Thanks for tuning in to my venting! :)",

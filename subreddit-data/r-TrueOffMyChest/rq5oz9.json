    "postText": "She was my high school sweetheart. The love of my life. My soulmate. When she suffered a brain injury and fell into a coma, I had no idea whether she would ever wake up again. When she did, she was severely disabled, and she was a different person.\n\nI hoped her old personality would come back with time and therapy, but it's been 5 years since she woke up, and I think this is just what she's like now. She's not a bad person, she's just not the woman I fell in love with. I'm expected to be grateful that I got my wife back, but the truth is my wife died the day she was injured.\n\nI hoped I would be able to fall in love with this new person, but you can't just force yourself to fall in love with someone. So I resent her. I know it isn't her fault, it's not fair that I feel this way towards her, but I resent this new woman for taking my wife away, and for the fact that I have to take care of her.\n\nI can't leave her. She has no one else to care for her. And she still has my wife's voice, her laugh, her smile. I couldn't bear to lose those, they're all I have left of the woman I love. So I pretend. I pretend I don't notice that she's a completely new person, I pretend I still love her, I pretend I don't resent her. I care for her. I've accepted that this is my life now.",

My dad suffered a very severe TBI, it\u2019s a miracle that he survived and the recovery progress was many years. Long after his physical recovery he was like a shell of his former self. He didn\u2019t like music anymore, he didn\u2019t laugh, he would remember that we (his kids) were an important person in life, but he would forget our names and exactly who we were. After several years he began to \u2018come back\u2019 and slowly started to laugh again and become himself.  Now it\u2019s been about 15 years and he so much more himself. I know it\u2019s different for everyone but try to embrace who she is and don\u2019t give up hope.\n\nEDIT: I have received such an overwhelming response to my comment, I wasn\u2019t expecting it to get so much attention. Thank you so much for the rewards, that is very kind of you guys! I have been reading through the many comments and it\u2019s really interesting to hear everyone\u2019s stories and thoughts. I hope OP has been reading through the comments and is able to take away something positive or hopeful, or at least feel a sense of camaraderie in all of the stories people have shared about their loved ones who also suffered a TBI.",

Unfortunately her temper is still very short, but the rest of her has slowly come back. She still has a way to go, but most days she's the woman I grew up admiring and striving to be like one day. It broke my heart to see my dad suffer in silence and sacrifice so much for the new her. Although I'm beyond grateful to have my mom back for my own selfish reasons, I'm happier to have her back for my dad! There was a time my brothers and I asked if he'd consider leaving her but he was adamant that he married for better or worse and sickness and health. Watching him come back brings a tear to my eye because (although he wasn't in the accident with her) we lost him the same time we lost her.\n\nEdit: just like the others on this thread, my mom was part of the exception and not the rule. The brain is an amazing organ, but totally unpredictable in its ability to heal itself. My family individually sought counseling to grieve the loss of my mother throughout the years. Although you may not want to give up hope, you must come to terms with the situation at hand. Sometimes it's harder to walk away, but healthier. My brothers and I were fortunate to have the ability to take care of my mother to alleviate some stress from my father, but none of us would have blamed him for not being able to do it.",

To be fully honest, im still recovering \n\nI'm a very verbal person. Communication was definitely one of my best qualities. I spoke 3 languages and could read 4 (I didn't speak Latin but could read it ok). Well much of that came to a grinding halt. I struggled with word recall. It felt like I knew the word, it even felt like I could see it in my mind like I could see it in big neon letters, but I just couldn't get the word out. It was incredibly frustrating. I've worked very hard on getting it back but I'm still not where I used to be. The other day I couldn't get the word \"consistent\" out. I had to say \"the word for when someone does something and they are able to do it the same way each time\" and they were able to help me and suggest \"consistent\" as the word I was looking for. I tried to exercise my brain after the wreck the same way I did physical therapy. I would read in English and translate to French in my mind or read in both languages. My Spanish and Latin have gone to shit though because I just didn't have the energy or brain to devote to them anymore. And as I get tired, and get extremely tired, it gets worse. For sure my head was hit on the left side which would indicate I damaged \"brocas area\" or \"wernickes area\" or maybe the area between them which might explain why I feel like I know the word but can't get it out. Either way,  I am much, much better than I was. \n\n  I also started doing something I definitely had never done before. When Ii get told something very sad or serious or am in the middle of a serious conversation, I can start to laugh. And inside I'm saying to myself \"what the fuck are you doing? Oh for the love of God you've got to stop laughing. You have to stop. Oh God Oh God stop fucking laughing.\" No it's not like the movie \"joker.\" It's more just little giggles. It looks like I'm not taking things seriously. I'll give you an example. My girlfriend is amazing. I mean seriously incredible and we'll probably be getting engaged this year. Well a few months ago she brought up she was feeling a little used because I would ask her to pick up our dog at my house and take him to her house so that I could just come over at the end of my shift (I work EMS and before you get worried, I don't laugh on scene about serious stuff because my brain is busy in job mode and you pretty much take emotion out of the call anyway until everything is done because too much emotion clouds your judgement). The other option is I could have come over to her house the night before and left from there to go work my 24 or 48, whichever it was that day. But she brought up how I had stopped asking her and was just sort of expecting it or telling her. She said she was starting to feel like a dog chauffeur and not like she was doing something nice for me as my girlfriend. And I immediately felt awful thinking \"wow, how could you have not seen that you were being rude and doing this?\" The idea that I had made my girlfriend feel taken advantage of was a big deal because she has even so supportive and patient as I enter this next huge step in my career. So before I could apologize and say \"you're right\" I started giggling. And right away she got very hurt because from her angle she saw me not taking her seriously. Which makes the moment even more serious and I start giggling more. Fortunately I was able to \"baby it's just the TBI\" and she remembered. Of course everything was fine but that truly bothers me that it can happen \n\n  Also, I get way overstimulated when around lots of loud noises like a children's birthday party. Or recently my GFs son wanted to go to Dave and Busters for his birthday. I did it, but it was so very hard for me. Like I had to do breathing exercises to stay calm. When it was more recent, no way I could have done that. In fact, sometime if I was hanging out with friends and family, I would just get up and walk away, go to my room and close the door and go to sleep. I had hit my limit for noise and interaction, etc and was overstimulated. The thing was, I got no warning. It just happened. I was like a child. Just all of a sudden my brain would say \"ok that's enough. We're done. Either leave or we make you completely flip your shit. You have 3 seconds to decide.\" \n\n  The other thing is, I wouldn't say I have a bad temper now because I can control it. But I find myself getting angry about things that shouldn't make me that upset. As i said, I can control it, but I have to remind myself it's not worth getting angry about or even thinking about. \n\n Also I saw double for some time and had to work on that using something called a Brock String. \n\nAnd it clicked \"delete\" on parts of my life but there doesn't seem to be a pattern to it. The 6 months before the wreck are totally gone but I have photos of it. I remember the wreck. And other parts from young adulthood (actually when I suffered a TBI just nowhere near as bad) are totally gone. The TBI connection is as close to a pattern as I can get \n\n What's particularly upsetting about all of this is, it isn't me. I'm very verbal and extremely social and was always very hard to make angry. Fundamentally, this isn't who I am. I feel like I'm being forced to carry a heavy backpack and saying \"but this isn't even my stuff in here? Why do I have to carry it?\" \n\nFortunately, I had really good people around me and am extremely lucky to still have them",

I was riding my motorcycle and got into an accident with a 16-wheel truck in September 2016. I was helicoptered to the ICU where I spent one month, broke my arm and my collarbone, and had a breathing and feeding tube inserted into me. I got a TBI at this time. I went to two years of rehab and had to start from the beginning, taking classes at the community college for another two years to get back academically (I graduated from Duke University in 2014, I was very different then academically). Then I took two classes at the University of Houston where my brother goes. I got C's in both those classes, previously I was a straight-A student. \n\nAfter that TBI I became a slightly different person from what my family has told me. My social skills changed in terms of being able to hold a conversation and keep up with my friends. As it is now I am 29 and still live with my parents, and I am very grateful to them for taking care of me. All my friends are living on their own. \n\nThank you personally for still being with your wife and taking care of her.",

OP says she has no family to take care of her, well, there are other services that can assist them/him - if he is struggling he might not have to do it alone. There's no shame in getting help so he can have time for himself to do whatever he needs to get through this. He's probably spent all of this time focused on her that he hasn't been able to deal with any of the impact on himself.\n\nThis really sounds like a situation where therapy is needed because carrying around feelings of resentment unresolved for years is not healthy and romanticising it just feels weird.",

They were easy to anger and not interested in prior hobbies for years. We didn't make it through, but we're friends and they've since found some old hobbies again. Part of what made them angry or disinterested was an avoidance of things that rang a bell from their life before but frustrated them because it came with pressure to be someone others knew but they didn't. I'd say not to take it longer than you can hold on, you can still care for the person and not be the partner, no matter how impossible that may seem. \n\nIn the end for myself, a caring nurse once talked to me and in a sense, gave me permission to only know my SO as who they had become. It was an understanding that gave me the strength to only support them from a distance, once I could no longer give anymore of myself in service of a lost love. My partner later mentored it became easier to recover without pressure to be someone people were longing for. I didn't realise it at the time, but they're haunted by the same ghost you are. Hope any of that helps, if not, sending big hugs either way.",

            "comment": "If I had been married during my brain injury\u2026 I imagine my husband writing this exact same thing. \n\nHaving a TBI has been the biggest and most horrifying thing to ever happen to me, because there is almost no time to adapt to the changes and they\u2019ll come and go as they please, leaving behind fading memories of the person you once were and reminders of a stolen, promised future. In a moment, nothing was ever the same again. \n\nIt\u2019s been 10 years since my injury, and I\u2019d say around year 8 was when I finally found peace and love and an understanding of all that happened. I still suffer from the symptoms of my injury but the person I\u2019ve become\u2026 it\u2019s a type of scarred beauty I don\u2019t think I ever could have found sans injury. It was all gained through suffering, trauma, coping mechanisms, desperate acts of survival, anything that made sure I chose to woke up the next day, because you are fighting for your own existence daily.\n\nMy mom is still going through the same pain you are, obviously in a different role but close enough that I hope you can relate. My mom wasn\u2019t ready for my brain injury, and neither was I. She tried desperately to focus on making me better (these types of TBIs can\u2019t be healed that way\u2026 you can only dream of stabilizing symptoms). So her goal of healing my brain like healing a broken arm had already set her up for failure. There wouldn\u2019t be the removal of a cast to reveal an intact bone that with a bit more PT, could eventually get back to 100%.  My brain was fucked up and we needed to adapt. I felt like a foreigner in my own body and the ghost of who I was haunted me. The dreams I once had that were no longer feasible, mocked me. I was surrounded and enveloped in loss, I was attending my own funeral every day, but I showed up to that mental funeral to fully mourn the loss of myself until I was genuinely ready to let go. In this analogy, I showed up to my funeral to find peace, while my mom showed up to my funeral to get answers. Answers she would never receive because she wasn\u2019t asking the right questions. \u201cWhen am I getting my daughter back\u201d \u201cwhen will she be normal\u201d \u201cwhen will this all stop\u201d. Those answers don\u2019t exist. It isn\u2019t BAD to ask those questions because they\u2019re part of the mourning process, but 10 years later, she\u2019s still attending my funeral and asking them. \n\nEventually I was able to bury the old me and celebrate the birth of the me now. Learning to embrace myself was so hard at first because even though I had fully accepted the loss, I was bitter towards what I had gained, which was *whatever* was occupying my thoughts and brain. It\u2019s like I was handcuffed to a stranger and my job was to become soul mates with them, and this stranger was NOTTT my ideal soul mate. I was mad that that was my situation and I wanted nothing to do with that \u201cperson\u201d. I didn\u2019t care about who they were because it\u2019s not like I chose to be handcuffed to this living, breathing personification of pain and suffering. I would have gnawed my own hand off to escape if I could; and that introduced, in reality, suicidal ideation. I have no fucking idea how I didn\u2019t go through with it, I should not have physically survived the Injury, and I shouldn\u2019t have emotionally survived the recovery. But I needed to learn to love and celebrate the new me. So I did. I shared my story, I found others similar to me, I wrote poetry to express my thoughts, I immersed myself into the emotions that now defined the new me. I realized that the new me is gentle, empathetic, patient, kind, and loves to make others feel comfortable. I became the things that I so desperately needed and didn\u2019t fully receive. And during this time, I look over and still see my mom demanding answers at the funeral. I have tried to go pull her out and show her the fun celebrations occurring, how happy I am, and to come join me to celebrate the new me. But she refuses. And it hurts. I can feel her withholding her love from me, as if she\u2019s waiting for her old daughter to return, and she sees me as some parasite who has taken the smile, eyes, body, and presence of her child. I AM the child she loved because I am the same soul. We aren\u2019t ever promised that we will remain the same person. Things started to become toxic when she would try and pin point anything she seemed weird or off about me and blame it on the injury. If I made a crass joke, brain injury, even though the old me would have made the same joke. She was creating very visible personalities and boxes for old vs current me and they were so so wrong. Anything about me she didn\u2019t like was due to the brain injury, she never considered that old me would have also done the same thing. Because that\u2019s her daughter, her dead daughter and you don\u2019t speak ill of the dead. \n\nSo she kept categorizing everything I did and very obviously put all the \u201cgood things\u201d in the old pile and \u201cbad things\u201d in the new pile, and this created an even further divide. Whenever I showed patience, she would think \u201coh wow that\u2019s the old Carmen! She\u2019s coming back!\u201d And put it in the old Carmen pile (that\u2019s my name\u2026 might as well dox myself). And the thing is, old me was NOTTTTT patient. That was a trait I learned when I realized how much patience I needed, and how much love it took to give it. So I felt invalidated watching my new traits go to the old me. To this day, my mom still struggles with this same problem while I have moved on happily and at peace. I have had to space myself away from her because of the anger she atoll carries because it got to the point where she was mad that I had moved on, something I needed to do for my own survival. \n\nI was a guest on a podcast a while back, it\u2019s called \u201cwait\u2026 you what?\u201d And I think it\u2019s the 4th episode. I talk about my brain injury and how it changed me, and maybe you can find something useful on there. I think Erica and I talked for 2 or so hours for a 30 min episode which meant a lot of stuff I personally felt was important had to be cut out to make good time. (So anyone who listens to it,  feel free to bother her about bringing me back, I\u2019d love to follow up with another interview if she\u2019s willing to have me) \n\nGood luck with working through this trauma. I hope you\u2019re able to do what\u2019s best for you and your wife\n\nEdit: y\u2019all are some of the most kind and complimenting motherfuckers I\u2019ve met. The messages and awards and comments have me overwhelmed with support. I really really hope OP has seen this comment and knows that his wife likely shares the same pain and resentment that he has but that the turmoil can be finite.\n\nI\u2019ve received a lot of comments about a book, but right now I\u2019ve been using whatever platforms I can to spread awareness without me needing to devote time creating the platform (as of now). I work as a neuroscientist so my time has definitely been busy elsewhere, but posting here on Reddit, getting podcast guest invites, being asked to write a small paragraph to be published somewhere are all things I\u2019ve done and will gladly do over and over to bring awareness to such a common ailment. I will never ever turn down an opportunity to speak about TBIs so if you\u2019ve got a platform and think my topic is useful, let me know. I was desperate to find others like me post injury and there just wasn\u2019t an obvious space. So, im trying to create that space where I can with what I\u2019ve got\n\nFollow up message for OP a few days after writing my original comment: your pain is valid and deserves space to exist in a world that likely feels like all attention has to go to your wife. I can almost assure you that she feels the exact same pain, and more than that, she can feel you feeling it and that HURTS. So you have the chance to break this cycle. Neither of y\u2019all are unaware of what\u2019s going on regarding the love lost. You didn\u2019t fall in love with your wife because of her humor or smile. You fell in love with her soul which created those things because of the Enviroment it was in, and now, her soul has been ripped into a new Enviroment and existence, which means she may lose the things you once identifies but damn, she will create such beautiful new characteristics once she\u2019s able to.  Tell her your pain during a time where you feel  most in touch with your feelings and are willing to be vulnerable. Tell her your fears, concerns, and ask her to reveal hers if she\u2019s willing. That conversation just might be the new foundation your new love grows on. Please don\u2019t hesitate to DM me. Patience is key. Expect frustration. Fight through it",

A common sentiment most people with brain injuries will share is the struggle to translate an internal and often times invisible pain into a verbal description. It\u2019s like trying to describe colors to someone who was born blind. Then you realize that you don\u2019t need them to see the colors, you need them to know how they make you feel. Laying them in the grass in a national park and smelling pine trees, that\u2019s dark green. And the same thing applied to being able to verbalize how I feel. I didn\u2019t need people to have a brain  injury to know how I felt, I needed to immerse them in the sensation.  I was so desperate to make connections right after my injury, and I realized I needed to do a better job of speaking a language others could understand. I was lucky enough in my injury that I had the energy and ability to confront my feelings in order to emerge with a translation that immediately makes me vulnerable to being judged or misunderstood. I feel like it\u2019s part of my duty to make TBIs, especially in woman, more known to the public, along with anyone else able to share their stories. It affects so many more people than imagined and no one should feel alone in something this common.",

I\u2019m very monotone when I speak and my words sound calculated, plus I lack expression in my face whenever I talk. Those are all ways people try to understand the intentions behind someone\u2019s words (tonal inflection, etc), so I try to compensate by being very descriptive when I speak and make sure there\u2019s no confusion in understanding how I feel because misunderstandings were a common occurrence when I would speak to people who didn\u2019t know me well. I can honestly come off as a sociopath, which my mom informed me of, so I do what I can to counter that. Her saying that was certainly hurtful but provided important insight: how others saw me wasn\u2019t matching how I felt internally. So that became a gap I wanted to close",

I made friends with someone who experienced a TBI and am trying really hard to learn more about it so I can be supportive. It probably helps that I didn\u2019t know him before hand but I struggle to understand his perspective and mood shifts. Many a time I come off the phone and cry not understanding why he gets angry or says strange things to me but reading about your experiences and recovery process certainly helps me understand his frustrations better. I\u2019m in a TBI subreddit to learn more so I can be more supportive and understanding but after reading what you wrote maybe the fact that I have no expectations or experience of who he was before maybe helps him a little.

I didn\u2019t even get Into this in my original comment, but my anger was OUT OF CONTROL. It was awful. I felt like I was a walking flame that devoured anyone who came close so I pushed people away to spare themselves of that pain. I realized  that so much of the anger stemmed from my inability to communicate how I felt. It\u2019s frustrating not being able to describe something but knowing full and well that something is wrong. \n\nIf I may suggest\u2026 even though your friend is going through so much, them harming you is NOT one of the steps of recovery.  It isn\u2019t okay. They may have an injury but they aren\u2019t stupid. They may not be aware of how bad it is (I wasn\u2019t) and the best love you can give is not allowing that type of toxic behavior to root itself in yalls friendship. The anger is masking a deeper problem. Next time he\u2019s angry, I\u2019d suggest saying something like \u201csaying that really hurts my feelings, and I know that isn\u2019t your intention, but it doesn\u2019t make the words you say go away. Can you try and express what potentially triggered that response?\u201d \n\nIt\u2019ll take some time but someone calling me out was a huge wake up call. You\u2019re an amazing person for being with them during their injury, but that will never excuse them being abusive. It\u2019s important to actively try to get better",

The way you talk is like how I try to be when I'm at my very best, and probably primed with caffeine or adderall. It's just really comforting that someone can be like that and I'm not sure what to do with this feeling.",

Sometimes I can feel a glimpse of what life may have been, who I could\u2019ve been and I feel that pang of pain and grief.

We only have one life and we can't waste it on hating ourselves. I'm sorry that your mom hasn't accepted you yet. I hope she will, soon. Maybe she needs therapy to accept the changes? \n\nI am still very confused about how this all works. I've read many comments here but I struggle to understand how people can drastically change personalities yet understand it so well and remember who they were, and even convey their emotions through writing. This is fascinating and scary. \n\nAnyway, thank you for writing this, Carmen, I don't remember being so invested in a comment in a while. I wish you all the best, I'll try to go and find that podcast with you.",

It\u2019s cathartic for me and I hope y\u2019all don\u2019t mind being my emotional release for the day! \n\nI like how you felt the juxtaposition of emotions, the discomfort and the warmth.  That\u2019s truly how\nrecovery felt for me. Constantly vulnerable and scared but having to push through that to ultimately find comfort in the very things that once scared me. \n\nI had very minimal memory loss which has allowed me to remember the old me, but I have no doubt that I\u2019m also remembering a warped version of me, either romanticizing it or demonizing it. But I also think I\u2019m not doing it more or less so than the average person trying to recall themselves as young children; we remember how we want to remember.  Putting my thoughts into words was a coping mechanism for me, as well as a way to overcome my fear of being misunderstood. It\u2019s taken a lot of practice and some days I can barely put a full sentence together (example: when I did the interview. I was EXHAUSTED and get irked every time I listen to it; I know I could have verbalized things better had I pushed the interview back, but i thought maybe it would be important to show a symptom of my injury which was odd word choices and weird things to focus on). \n\nThank you for taking the time to read and I hope you have a wonderful holiday \ud83d\udc9a\u2764\ufe0f",

This happened after 16 years of marriage. I never resented my wife, but I definitely resented the situation we were in. Although difficult, I have grown to accept our fate and make the best of the life we have. I began falling in love with her all over again.  She is the most resilient woman I've ever known. I had an idea of this prior to her injury, but watching her battle for everything she has has been a real eye opener.  \nFor better or worse. Sickness and in health. It's not easy, but I hope you can find a spark to grow a new flame. HMU if you want to chat.",

She seemed pretty put together at the time, she had some personality quirks but was fun to be around. Over the decades she has really changed. She now has gaps in her memory *after* the accident. She is easily manipulated, where before she was steadfast. She always had a bit of a temper, but now she just has bursts of anger from things that don\u2019t deserve it. She can no longer hold down a job for long, but she still tries and gets fired within a month. I found out after running into her again and finding out how much she has drastically changed that what she went through is pretty common. Makes sense, it\u2019s like those concussion injuries that have lead to erratic behavior in older football players that people are discovering now.",

Honestly, you miss the dreams you had once made for yourself and you mourn the loss of the you that you understood.

Sometimes I wish I lost my memory completely so that I didn\u2019t constantly compare the new me to the old me, because the ghost of who I once was haunts me as a constant reminder that the injury exists. Letting my old self go, telling my \u201cghost\u201d that it\u2019s okay to let go, was the best and hardest thing I did for myself. Attending your own funeral as an active participant isn\u2019t something you ever realistically imagine. People with different injuries will experiences different forms of loss, but this was mine",

When I was 2 years old my dad fell off a 2 story building (he was a roofer) and survived but with a major TBI. I\u2019ve known him my whole life the way he is, so I don\u2019t know any different. Everyone says how different he is, the shell of a person who used to be. It hurts me because I love who he is now. My mom couldn\u2019t it stand it though and she had us kids and the seizures scared us, it was like her having another child to care for and it was too much. He didn\u2019t even remember her when he woke up after a 30 day coma. They got divorced 2 years after her trying and now his parents take care of him. I have a great relationship with him but I feel sad because he is very lonely. He is super happy doing the things he loves but I know he is lonely and feels like he has no friends. \nAnyway, reading your post makes me kind of have insight as to what my mom must have thought when she tried to stay. But now she\u2019s remarried and has another kid with my stepdad and all. But to be honest I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ever recovered from the trauma of what happened with my dad I think it changed her life forever making her depressed because she lost the love of her life. \nWish I had a good answer on what to do; because you deserve to life a happy beautiful life and it isn\u2019t fair that you lost your person, it isn\u2019t fair what happened to them. \nWhat if you could find happiness though with your situation and the right caregivers? I think it\u2019s amazing that you stay. Sometimes I wonder what it would be life if my parents were still together but with this situation, how could resentment not be present? \nMaybe you resent yourself a little too for pretending. Anyway, I doubt that my comment helped you, but you aren\u2019t alone. I hope you find peace, love, and joy whatever you decide to do.",

Any kind of support you can get, whether it's from her being a victim of a crime or just your county's department of aging and/or disability services? (They have different names in different counties.) Could you ask the social worker at your hospital whether there are respite programs that you could use, if she needs more intense care?\n\nThis is such a complicated situation. You made a vow to her: in sickness and in health. I believe in that, too; through thick and thin is what makes the commitment of marriage so profound. But we each only get one shot at life. Since I don't know your wife and I don't know you, I can only speak for how I would feel if I were in your wife's place: I would absolutely, *utterly* not want what happened to me to ruin your life as well. I would be so profoundly grateful for your caregiving, and I do think it's entirely appropriate (vows, love, etc), but if I were literally no longer the person you married, if you stayed by my side (many people wouldn't) I would also want you to do *anything* that would give you a little joy and freedom, as long as it stayed separate from the relationship with me. \n\nOne life has been changed forever--but there's no upside to sacrificing two. If there's anything you can do, any services you can find, any time you can have to yourself... I would want that for you *desperately* if I were in your wife's position, especially if you stayed by my side and did all that stressful caregiving. \n\nI'm so sorry that your life was blown into smithereens by this psychotic person. If there's anything at all you can do to bring some joy into your life, I hope you find a way to do that.",

            "comment": "Hey brain surgery last year. I am like your wife. I feel the very same as you do.\n\nAs a survivor but also disabled I feel a burden on my wife. I was the main provider and we felt fairly young in our early 30s. Prepping for life and kids. Then I decide to almost die and my health was just shit during covid! \n\nAnyways I've dragged her down mentally and physically and I didn't want to. When I woke up I knew her but my memory is so bad. She stuck with me through the first year! So much shit I would even want anyone to deal with! She did it for me and our love but I acknowledge I died unexpectedly one day. I told her I'll be here for support but I don't want her to feel stuck. I'm not who I was and we both know that. She says that she believes her love for me will outweigh the differences.\n\nWell it's about 15 months and my memory of that old life still sucks. I'm still disabled. I still can't work and I don't have anything or anyone haha. I'm not going to trap her in my life. We were 'young' and she still has plenty of time!\n\nAs a survivor and the wife of a care taker I encourage you to speak to her about this. Maybe you guys could sort it out. Maybe you can't.\n\nI know I haven't been able to. I know I'm not who I was and I may never be that person again. I never would obligate her to someone else. Why would I expect her to like a new version of me. It's weird and people judge. I get shit for talking to friends about seeing other people and having a break. It must suck on her end too.\n\nSituation sucks and a lot of people don't know it as well. They just don't go through it. The feeling is rough.\n\nI struggle with memory mostly but for the first few months I was unable to walk. I was in the hospital during the height of covid - no visiting. Also I almost died during it too, so that was rather weird for her to go through. She couldn't see me for 2 months. Covid had hospitals locked down. And well I basically died in the emergency room and then somehow got saved within like 15 mins of me bleeding to death or something brain stuff. My wife couldnt be there! She was stuck at home/car or whatever and she basically sat by her phone hoping a nurse would call with a positive update. The only picture she got of me was after surgery and I was all hooked up and piped and stuff. Football head, black eyes, intubated, and half shaved bloody stitched head. Gross. Just gross. She stuck with me! I admire her strength but I need her to take the next step. I mean it fucking hurts both ways but sometimes I wish she left me the day I woke up in rehab. I would recover with patchy memory and well she could just say I died. \n\nIdk I'm not the greatest of lovers - at least I think. My mobility improved. I'm clearly going to never heal in certain ways. I'm not going to ask her to do this for the rest of whatever time there is. Makes zero sense. I just know I loved her so fucking much and it kills me to see her this way. See it in her face every damn day. I want to hear from her. It sucks but it has to be said.\n\nEdit: I can't believe anyone read this.",

I am no longer able to do many of the things I used to love. I have lost 70% the use of my doninant arm and hand  I don't smile or laugh much any more. Sex life is drastically altered. On and on. I mourn the loss of all of those things. And although I try to ask as little as possible from my husband, I know he resents being put into a caretaker role. I go without services I need because we can't afford it and I don't want my husband to feel obligated to do it. \nI honestly would understand if my husband wanted to leave me. I think we would have split of we didn't have kids. Neither of us will leave them.  On good days it feels like co-parenting roommates. On bad days I cry a lot, from both physical and emotional pain. \nOn some days, though, I think about how marrying a person, you never know what is going to happen to cause change in a relationship. The relationship is built on an expectation of loving and caring, without guarantees that nobody will get sick or have a disaster. Perhaps when we are young, we just imagine everything will be just perfect all the time, but that's not a reality of life. \nFrom my perspective as the disabled one in a marriage, I can assure you that she can tell that you resent her. She probably feels as trapped and stuck as you. I hope you both find a way to move forward that is not filled with misery. Neither of you deserves it.",

One day while teaching, she began leaking spinal fluid out of her nose and collapsed. I spent a year looking for a doctor who wouldn't just brush her off, because of her medical background, and finally she was diagnosed with severe chronic Lyme disease. Her doctor thinks she had it since she was a kid and the steroids woke it up, causing lesions in a pituitary gland and holes in her brain. She had to relearn how to walk and talk, all while we were trying to get my daughter her heart transplant.(but that's a different story in itself) she's been recovering for four years and and I've come to the realization that my anger from the situation had began spilling out sideways towards her and our kids, so reluctantly I started therapy. Didn't help. Just offered me pills to make me numb. I have no interest in that. Anyways, We been together 24 years and everyday since she collapsed has been hard for her. And it took me awhile to stop asking \"why us\" and stop being selfish. She gave me her love and life and four great kids,and honestly I was at the point not too long ago where I was questioning my own sanity and how was I going to handle the rest of our lives, until I woke up one day and was looking at the pen Coldwell banker Burnett gave her for being rookie of the year in 2014-15 and it dawned on me how strong this woman is and how insecure I was being. I look at that pen everyday and think about what she was able to accomplish in such a little time. How many people she educated and helped get their lives on track. How she got her teaching job from organizing a study group and persuaded half the school to attend, making it the most successful graduating class in the schools two hundred year history. How she left her teaching and realestate careers to care for her mother who was dying of cancer. How she saved me from myself when I was a destructive young man. How she put up with all my transgressions and insecurities over twenty years. She gave me way more than I ever realized, and that changed my outlook on everything. My only concern now is hearing her laugh and learning how to help her deal with how much she actually lost. And how much we actually gained through all this. this is my two cents,spend them the way you see fit. On a lighter note. I will be proposing to \"my gaby-baby\" on her mother's birthday in may and marrying her in her mother's house.yes we've be together 24 years. No never married. Just was never a issue. Together was always good enough. Although I realized marrying her now would help with her insecurities about becoming disabled and hopefully ease her mind about me always being by her side. If you love her,then love her. Never easy. Never simple.",

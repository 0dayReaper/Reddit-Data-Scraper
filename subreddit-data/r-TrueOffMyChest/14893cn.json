    "postText": "I\u2019m getting married in August, and I\u2019m so unbelievably happy about that\u2026 but my first therapy appointment is the day before my wedding, and I find myself looking forward to that more. \n\nI scheduled my appointment in March of this year. It was originally scheduled for the end of April, and I clung to that date as a way to cope with some stuff that was going on at the time. Less than a week before my appointment, the office called to reschedule it to August with no explanation. It was \u201cthe earliest available appointment\u201d apparently. \n\nMy mental health tanked. I\u2019ve called every office within 50 miles, they either have even longer wait lists or don\u2019t take my insurance. \n\nI\u2019m having a baby in October. I can\u2019t handle this, I need to be ok before my daughter arrives. I\u2019m drowning and there\u2019s nothing I can do except wait. I don\u2019t even get to know why it was rescheduled. \n\nEvery day is a struggle for me and I barely even do anything. I\u2019m so exhausted all the time and if it wasn\u2019t for my partner I would\u2019ve given up a long time ago. I can\u2019t do this.",

Both the wedding and welcoming a new baby are happy but stressful events. Meanwhile, maybe try some mindfulness practice or journaling to calm your mind. Congratulations!",

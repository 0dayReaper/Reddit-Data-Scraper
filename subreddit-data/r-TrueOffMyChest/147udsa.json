    "postText": "My father passed away unexpectedly last year. For some background we had not had the greatest relationship due to my step mother but were recently on better terms. I was my father's only child and his wife had two children from a previous marraige that are quite a bit older than I am. \nI got the call that my dad died and raced over to his house, I did not know they had not gotten him out of the house yet so I stayed outside and spoke with the funeral home. My step sister was in the home with my step mother. My step mother was having memory issues and she could not live on her own. The next day the three of us went to the funeral home to make arrangements, some of which I did not agree with but since he was married they listened to what my step mother wanted. I continued to show support to my step mother and step sister, went and cleaned the house and stayed to take care of my step mother when my step brother or sister could not. My step mother told me to take some things from the house and put notes on a couple things she knew my dad wanted me to have. Right before my dad's funeral my step mother fell and was taken the the hospital so she was not able to attend. I continued to help where I could and figure things out as he did not have a life insurance policy. My step sister kind of took the reigns and I was fine with that as she was keeping me updated on everything. After the funeral my step mother deteriorated and then she passed away a few months later. I continued to keep and touch and offer condolences and help with everything. They were hoarders so we knew we had a long road ahead of us with cleaning everything up. I offered my help as well as offered my friends and husband to help when they could. \nIn the meantime cameras were put on the property so I was not allowed to go to the house unless escorted with my step sister or her girlfriend. I bit my tongue and continued to offer support. \nThey planned an estate sale and took things they wanted from the home, which I encouraged them to do before it went through the estate. I was not given that option. I went to the sale and my husband and friends helped with selling things. I paid over 1000$ for things I wanted from the home that meant something to me but would have liked to get other sentimental things, I was not given the chance because everything else they did not see as valued was thrown away. \nAt this point I knew I did not have leg to stand on as my father did not have a will, so legally everything was theirs. I continued to offer support when needed but they never called to take me up on it. I continued to talk to them about things that going on etc. After the sale I grew very frustrated that I was not being included in anything. My dad had a classic car that he had promised me my entire life, I asked to just at least be the one to sell it because of the sentimental value to me, I found out on Facebook that they had sold it, not even giving me the chance to be there. My father was the breadwinner of the family and built his home on my grandmother's land himself. I ended up distancing myself but they had promised I would get a 3rd of the profits from anything. I wasn't going to hold my breath because of how I had been treated so far. \nThey cleaned the house, never asked for my help even though I continually asked them to do so and now the house is in settlement. I have not spoken to them for 6 months. My dad would be furious with how things happened. Neither one of them have a gravesite that I know of and as far as I'm aware his ashes are still at the funeral home. I'm so beyond hurt by their actions and just needed to vent somewhere. There are so many other things that happened, as well. I did speak to a lawyer but because there is no will it will go to them.\nI have had so much depression since this happened that I finally had to bite the bullet and go to the Dr after almost having a nervous breakdown. I feel like I did not to get to properly grieve either of their deaths due to how this all happened and I'm not sure how to deal with it and I don't know if I should confront them and tell them how I feel or just let it go. This is not about the money, I just feel shafted in every way. They put a post on Facebook about how they got to spend so much time together cleaning out the house, I commented that I wish I was included -no response, no message. It just honestly makes me so sad.\n\nTLDR; father and step mother passed, step sister and step brother took everything",

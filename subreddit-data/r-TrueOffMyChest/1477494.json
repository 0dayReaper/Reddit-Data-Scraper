    "postText": "Please click on my account to find the previous post because none of this will make sense if you don\u2019t. \n\n\nTo those of you who have seen my previous post I did take your advice and I left it up to Ruby about what she wanted to do and she really did want to meet her sisters. One of my cousins (Ruby\u2019s sister) was having a housewarming party this weekend and I spoke with her before hand about the situation which she was doubtful but agreed to me bringing her. \n\nThis all happened yesterday, when I brought her with her my two cousins (her sisters) automatically saw a resemblance to my aunt and themselves as well. Side by side one of my cousins and her look like they could be twins. We were talking about the resemblance and my cousins were mostly just quiet and confused. Ruby showed them the Christmas photo and they believed her.\n\nMy cousin holding the housewarming party I will call Lima cried. I talked with her and asked if it was because she was upset with her mom but she said it was because she wish she knew she had another sister and she\u2019s just very sentimental when it comes to family. My cousins Lima and Lina were very close to Ruby for the rest of the evening and all of our family at her house had some questions. It looks like there wasn\u2019t too much drama until today.\n\nMy aunt called my phone over 30 times when I was sleeping after the house party. I haven\u2019t called her back but it sounds like all hell broke loose. When I called my cousin Lima she told her dad (aka ex-uncle) it turns out he did not know about Ruby and called to curse my aunt out. \n\nI am right now anxious to talk to my aunt right now. I am just glad that Lima and Lina got to meet Ruby.",

    "postText": "Husband and I just tested positive, and are at max freakout. \n\nWe have been married 4 yrs, together 7. The pregnancy is intentional, it was first time trying we just didn't know it would take so quickly. All those years of my husband using the laptop on his lap did zero damage apparently. \n\nI'm freaking out because I can't picture a happy/safe/clean/affordable world for our kid to grow up. Everyday it seems like the world is getting worse and worse. \n\nMy husband is freaking out because of the change. We both have decent jobs, and save enough to afford a decent apartment/travel/enjoy hobbies. We are possibly living our best lives, and its hard to picture it going uphill from here. \n\nHave our first doctor's appointment this week, despite it being a our choice, we're still on the fence about asking the doctor about terminating.",

Depending on where you are, there are 6 week bans on termination in some places. You mentioned it was your first time trying, so that kinda implies you guys talked about it. Revisit those conversations about being willing to try if you had any, and explore what is making you anxious now. What ever choice you make is right for you, and that\u2019s perfectly fine. You seem kinda unsure, so revisiting things may help you decide which route to go.",

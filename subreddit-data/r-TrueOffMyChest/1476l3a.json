    "postText": "I (26 F) had a fight with my partner (30 M ) yesterday. I started the fight, not intentionally, and it kind of just spiralled out from a conversation about previous hurts that i haven't gotten over. One of this was that he raped me while high on marijuana, when i begged him to stop. The sex started out consensually but I wanted to stop because i was in pain and he pinned me down while i begged him to stop, till he finished.  Without giving anymore details,  he claims that he was too high to understand me and he didn't do it intentionally.  There were some inconsistencies to his claim, but i chose to believe him and I got back with him after the incident.  Yesterday I brought it up, and ended up asking him what he has done to show me that he was truly sorry, and he says that we have sex far less now and he has accepted it and  last time he was high,  he wanted to have sex and i said no and he accepted it. To this I asked him how else he was supposed to behave, was he supposed to hold me down and rape me regularly. He answered that many men would do it, but he hasn't and I should be appreciative. I let it slide yesterday, but now that i think about it, it makes me afraid.",

This is not love, this is not what someone who respects you would do. Please have compassion for yourself, please find some support to get out of this. Hell, you can message me. I\u2019ll listen and help you as much as possible. You\u2019re not an object for someone else\u2019s enjoyment and you deserve to feel safe and loved. Best wishes.",

            "comment": "He's lying to you about the rape. I can tell you that with 100% certainty. As someone who has gotten so stoned that I've basically timeskipped entire days, THC doesn't just erase the concept of consent from your brain like that\u2014as he demonstrated by admitting that he was able to control himself while high recently. It makes you kind of loopy, slow to respond, in some cases wildly horny, but it doesn't suddenly turn decent men into rapists.\n\nThe fact that he's saying that you should appreciate that he doesn't rape you tells me he has a thing for it. I'm not going to go as far as to say that he will rape you again because honestly, people can have fucked up fetishes and paraphilias and never act on them. However, though many men would repeatedly rape their partners, many more would be horrified at the mere suggestion of hurting someone they love like that, intoxicated or not. You can appreciate that your partner doesn't regularly rape you while also acknowledging that it's fucked up for that to be an expectation. These things aren't mutually exclusive. The fact that your partner is expecting gratitude and appreciation for not repeatedly traumatizing you is fucked up.\n\nI understand that \"pack up and run\" may not be an option for you, so instead: have you two ever considered couple's counseling? It may help to get professional insight on the situation. Best case scenario, your partner has some bad teachings and habits he needs to unlearn ASAP. Worst case scenario, this relationship could get severely abusive later down the line.",

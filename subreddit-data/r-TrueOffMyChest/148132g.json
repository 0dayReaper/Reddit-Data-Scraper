They can help guide compulsive liars toward the root of the problem and improve things from there.\n\nAnd when you lie, you need to correct yourself to that person. Letting your lies keep being believed gives you no consequences, and thus no need to change.",

To get an advantage, to prevent uncomfortable situations, to make someone feel good, to make themselves feel good and it\u2019s pretty normal up to a certain point even if it\u2019s not a nice thing. Try to figure out the reasons why you keep lying - what are the situations? What are you trying to achieve by telling lies to others and why can\u2019t you get yourself to be honest to them or yourself? It\u2019s not that easy but I think you have to go deep into it in order to be able to change something about it",

They are really good guys and really have no reason to lie about anything, but they will always throw a lie into a conversation even if the truth sounds better. The thing is, I call them out on it usually, and sometimes they try to laugh it off, and sometimes they just swear to it and keep going. Everyone around knows they are lying and laughs about it behind their backs and some to their face, but it doesn't seem to bother either of them. This is probably happening to you, but you just don't know it.",

We all lied to the point where it was unnecessary to lie. \n\nAt some point, I reversed course and became too truthful, even to the point of hurting people. \n\nLying gives us a sense of control over the narrative of our lives. We can tell our own version of the truth. I think I used to lie because how miserable my life was and it was easier than letting someone in. Because the real version of me I've found to be a person undeserving of love.\n\nIts not so much that you lie about everything, its the underlying reason why you do it that you need to address. Truth is, you need to find out in yourself why you lie. That's the only healthy way forward.",

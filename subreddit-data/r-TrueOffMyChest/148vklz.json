    "postText": "I (23F) have had an up and down relationship with my grandfather. Growing up I would spend a week with him and my step grandma at their house every summer. One day when I was about 10 I met the asshole side of him. \nHe was the type of guy that would scream at his employees and ask them if they were \u201cf\u2019ing idiots.\u201d Later in life my mom informed me that he would make comments to her like, \u201cgo make me a sandwich,\u201d or \u201cdoes she ever shut up?\u201d He left my dad and grandma when he was around 1 or 2 in a trailer park full of roaches to go live the country club lifestyle. He was never a father figure to my dad and I\u2019m glad. \nAnyways, I played golf growing up and one day when I was around 10 we were playing together. Unbeknownst to me, he was pissed that I was beating him. After a few holes of him whining about how bad he was playing he went into a fit of rage and told me to get in the cart and that we were going home. He took my phone and called my parents. He told me in the car that I just use him and my step grandma to go shopping and I don\u2019t really care about them. I honestly don\u2019t remember what the reason he said was when he called my parents but my mom drove immediately over to come get me. \nAfter that I didn\u2019t really stay with them for long periods of time. I can tell my dad is longing for a relationship with him and he always pressures me to go visit him and try to mend the relationship. He\u2019s on his fourth marriage and his current wife could give two shits about my dad and me. If my grandpa and dad have a disagreement, they just completely shut us out. I would always initiate the phone calls, but now that I work full time I stopped and wondered if they\u2019d ever reach out. They never did. It\u2019s been almost a year maybe. \nMy tipping point for not caring for a relationship anymore was when he told me he wanted to ask my boyfriend if he had splinters in his butt. I asked why. He said \u201cbecause all he does is ride the bench (My boyfriend works really hard and plays at a top D1 school for his sport and in his whole teams unbiased opinion does not start because of politics).\u201d I really couldn\u2019t believe he would say something like that out of the blue when he knows the situation and how good of a person my boyfriend is. \nAbout an hour ago my dad told me that a cousin I have from my grandpas third marriage texted my dad saying he is sorry to hear what happened and he is there if he needs anything. My dad was confused and asked what he meant. He said my grandpa has an ischemic stroke. My dad texted my grandpas wife and she said it was best if we didn\u2019t visit right now. He will now have to do physical and speech therapy. My dad is telling me I need to reach out and try to mend our relationship but I do not see the point. It really does not affect me considering he doesn\u2019t seem to care about me. What upsets me is how poorly he treated my dad but my dad still wants to be in his life when he could care less.",

    "postText": "So I make a living by doing freelance content creation for social media account. Then earlier, while looking for a potential client, I saw this job post on an FB group. She's looking for an intern who has at least two years experience in socmed management and will the job of an entire marketing team, handling ads included. And yes, that's UNPAID.\n\nAt the point, I couldn't help but call her out because she's obviously looking for an unpaid labor. I mean, come on, the purpose of internship is to expose newbies to the field. WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU LOOKING FOR SOMEONE WITH AT LEAST TWO YEARS EXPERIENCE?! Not to mention, you also wanted them to handle the ads? Even an experienced online marketer like me isn't experienced enough to confidently handle that.\n\nAnd then there's this bitch who argued on her behalf. She wrote a long-ass essay in an attempt to call me an entitled and spoiled brat professionally. Quoting her (translated), \"Knowledge and experience are valuable assets. No amount of monetary gain will ever outweigh that.\" At that point, it became so obvious she won't back down.\n\n(And by the way, I checked her past posts, and she owned a Digital Marketing agency, and she's hiring interns.)\n\nThis is so fucked up. Gone are the days when interms are merely students. Now, capitalists idiots are using them for monetary gains. Disgusting.",

Or internships are done for one to two months in collaboration with your local unemployment office if you are unemployed where you get unemployment pay from the government while interning. It gives the company a \"free\" chance to check if you are a fit for them, usually used as a way for new graduates to transition into the workforce. If the companies don't ever hire the interns the unemployment office stops allowing them to have interns, so it can't be exploited as endless free work.\n\nI think that's reasonable, what you describe sounds like exploitation.",

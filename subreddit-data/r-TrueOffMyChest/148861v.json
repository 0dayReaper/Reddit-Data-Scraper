    "postText": "My best friend\u2026 former best friend and I have not been getting along for awhile. Im going to leave her and never come back, she has no clue. I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t even realize that we\u2019re fighting, im sure she doesn\u2019t even realize im mad. But I\u2019ve never been one for big fights. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to family about how I\u2019ve been feeling and they support me, but it\u2019s been hard definitely. I\u2019ve come to realize there\u2019s no way to tell her how Im feeling without ruffling feathers and today was my last straw. \n\nI\u2019m tired of her refusing to talk to me about any issue she has with me and then making snarky remarks about them towards me randomly. But if I actively bring up something that\u2019s been bothering me to find some workaround or compromise it\u2019s either oh you\u2019ll be fine! Or they\u2019ll throw some mistake I made in my face as a reason they don\u2019t have to. \n\nIm tired of her throwing whatever she needs to in my face to get her way. Because she\u2019s been the only one given access to what bothers me the most. When I would never use her issues against her. Im still mad about her throwing her making more money than me as a reason to get what she wanted when we split everything 50/50 cost wise. \n\nIm mad that I didn\u2019t throw my parents having money in her face, because I felt it would be rude to call her and her family broke even when my family is the one who has been helping both of us out financially because neither of us nor her family had the financial means or credit history to be able to get us where we are.\n\nIm mad that I shared my belongings because she never once bothered to take care of them. Im mad I bought expensive stuff with the expectation of it lasting a lifetime, only for it to have heavy signs of wear and tear in months. I\u2019m mad stuff I care about has gotten ruined permanently, but if I bring it up in a gentle request she\u2019ll throw something I forgot to do 5 weeks ago in my face. \n\nIm mad I know for a fact she\u2019s thrown something of mine away that I put in water because I do projects with sugar and things get sticky and hard and need to soak, and I know I should\u2019ve fixed it sooner but hard sugar is small places is hard to clean so I just keep adding hot water. But I\u2019m mad because if I mention it to ask if she threw my stuff away, I\u2019ll just get well I was tired of seeing it, so.. \n\nIm mad because I know if she sees this and figures out it\u2019s about her, i\u2019ll be the bad guy for posting it. But im already the bad guy for asking her to leave the dishes in the dishwasher if they still have food on them instead of putting them in the pantry after pulling the \u201cclean\u201d stuck on food off. \n\nIm mad im even considering her feelings right now when she wouldn\u2019t even try to consider my feelings when I asked her to not be as loud at 2 Am waking me up when I have to go to work. \n\nAnd I really think my boiling point was when she dismissed me today, \u201cit won\u2019t kill you\u201d I don\u2019t know why that cemented that I don\u2019t ever want to talk to you again but it did.\n\nMy ask was completely inconsequential to her that drove me over the edge. She pulled chicken out of the freezer to thaw but she put the bowl of raw chicken on top of the sugar container.\n\nI asked her please don\u2019t put the raw chicken on top of the sugar container. And move the sugar myself. She didn\u2019t need to do anything. The first words out of her mouth were says the girl with the moldy coffee cup. (I forgot a cup at my desk before I went out of town and it grew mold while I was gone) I told her I never say anything when you leave the raw chicken uncovered in the fridge by my fresh veggies even though it freaks me out i don\u2019t want the chicken germs in the sugar I use for coffee every day. And she just replied it wont kill you. \n\nI just feel like this is the last time I want to be talked to like this especially since she was standing right infront of her pot of food she cooked the day before and decided she wasn\u2019t gonna finish so they\u2019ll sit there until she needs that pot again. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve told her repeatedly because I know im not perfect and things get overlooked cause I get laser focused on something im doing. If im overlooking something remind me and I\u2019ll do it. \n\nBut don\u2019t make snarky comments about something once I\u2019ve managed to get it done on my schedule when you refused to bring it up cause then in my head its non urgent and I\u2019ll deal with what\u2019s causing me stress now first. \n\nThat\u2019s the end of my rant i am in the process of getting my stuff together mentally as well I just needed to get that out of my system cause it was filling me with negative emotions and I didn\u2019t need that",

            "comment": "My older daughter had a similar situation with her friend. This happened when she was 15, so 3 years back. She felt exhausted because her friend was using her to get her way with things and my daughter felt like she was being a push over. Wife and I explained that as we get older we start to see things in people, family and friends alike, who had these traits all along. We offered our support to her and stuck by her decision to end the friendship because they grew apart. She has a healthy group of friends that don\u2019t emotionally drain her or make her feel used. \n\nPeople grow in different directions. Make sure you be around people who like you for you and not because they can try to manipulate you. That\u2019s my dad advice for the evening!",

It's clear she has a lot of stuff to work through, but you shouldn't let her do it on your dime.\n\nAnd you did the right thing by not throwing your family's money in her face. Her family's financial situation isn't something she could control and certainly isn't her fault. Stay on the high road here.\n\nBut be clear. Send her an email or a text message when she does something you expressly asked her not to do so that you have a record of it and she can't gaslight you. And put her on notice: If she doesn't stop with the bullshit, you can't be roommates anymore. And especially if she's now in a position to support herself. You need to cut her off. She's toxic.",

                    "comment": "I try not to mention her family situation at all cause we\u2019re not even slightly rich just average income but good credit. When we got a place we didn\u2019t have enough money saved or make enough to get a place so we added my mom to the lease cause hers didn\u2019t make enough to help us. and as soon as we were deciding who gets the bigger room shes like well im working two jobs so i make more money and i was so close to throwing it in her face cause my parents pay our bills and we pay them back when we can. \n\nI did snap a little today though cause she made a remark about my \u201cdaddy issues\u201d and made a joke about it being why i like older men like 5-7 years older and i threw hers back in her face cause I got tired of things I told her in confidence getting thrown back in my face especially since those \u201cissues\u201d i have are old and i worked through most of them with my dad years ago. But she already knows im moving out but she doesn\u2019t know im cutting contact the day I leave. \n\nIm as clear as I can be with her though I tell her exactly what I need and she says okay, does the opposite and if I bring it up she tells me it\u2019s fine and it\u2019s not a big deal until I drop it she makes sure I know that since she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal she doesn\u2019t care and will not attempt to change. \n\nI almost posted a photo of my baking sheets to mildly infuriating but it\u2019s not really relatable unless you\u2019re passionate about good quality bakeware.",

Pack away the things you don't want her to destroy if you're able, don't leave anything out that she can mess with, keep contact to a minimum and totally professional. Remove all emotion. Don't react to her BS. Effectively, cut off meaningful contact before you move out and cut off all contact. \n\nGood luck to you!",

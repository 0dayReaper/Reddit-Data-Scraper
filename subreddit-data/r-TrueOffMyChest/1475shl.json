    "postText": "\nGood evening \n\nI\u2019m not trolling, I\u2019m just a nervous and anxious girl and I realised I did something very wrong to my boyfriend \n\nI think I SA\u2019d him, he was playing video game on his computer and I started trying to arouse him (he told me he was horny earlier and he wanted me to do things on him but I wasn\u2019t in the mood so he left me alone) so I came back and I started kissing and touching his stick. He was playing, he was like \u00ab\u00a0mmmh sorry I\u2019m not really in the mood now !\u00a0\u00bb so I stopped what I was doing, and I came back one minute later again to tease him in a playful mood and I started caressing his thing again and said saucy things in his ear like \u00ab\u00a0oh really you don\u2019t want me to @@@@ your @@@@\u00ab\u00a0 he told me again \u00ab\u00a0sorry, I\u2019m really not in the mood I wanna play\u00a0\u00bb so I left him alone for good \n\nA few minutes later I realised I touched him after he told me he wasn\u2019t in the mood\u2026 it was against his consent and insisted, i was forceful to him\u2026. So I apologised to him, I told him it wasn\u2019t correct to touch him after he told me he didn\u2019t want me to take care of him. He told me to relax, it was okay, he didn\u2019t feel assaulted and he said I have the right to try to convince him and I shouldn\u2019t worry like that \n\nI still feel very bad. I\u2019ve been raped a few years ago and maybe I\u2019m becoming like my assaulter \n\nDo you think I had a rapist / assaulter behaviour ? What do you think about it",

In my opinion (and in your bf opinion also, because he said so) you didn't cross the boundaries. Also, you should probably see some mental health counselor if you already are not, because this kind of projection can be hard on the partner mental state in long term.",

This happened to me too quite many times.\n\nHe was horny before that and you were not so he was turned off/down and left without trying again. As a fact that's IT nothing else. He decided to do something else instead and moved on.\n\nNow, if he's as or a bit sensitive as/like me, maybe he rejected you bc you rejected him first so it comes the thought of \"oh, when I'm horny you're not in the mood, so now that you are, you want me to just do it?\". And he just kept playing. \nIn this case THERE'S NO SA from you, just a childish (maybe?) reaction to previous rejection from him and you're totally fine. (In my experience, I have NEVER EVER felt SA from my gf at the time when something happened. I was just upset/uneasy from rejection).\n\nI hope you get to feel better and that you are able to ease off with time what happened to you in the past (it must be damn hard) and you have to know that trying to seduce your partner IS MORE THAN ALLOWED! How're you gonna make babies if not haha\n\nAs long as you both respect each others boundaries and learn to accept that not always you or your partner are in the mood for intimacy, you'll be fine! Communication is key, especially when it comes to sex.\n\nTake care and chill! All is good and I don't think you should stop being spontaneous and naughty together.",

I hate people who disregard it.\n\nBUT\n\nWhat I mean is how things got taken too far, for example when people judge couples when one party decides to kiss the other and they scream they need the other's consent first. This is not a relationship but some '1984' bullshit. We are not robots. You know your partner, they know you, you I believe guys can trust each other not to be disrespectful and violent.\n\nI mean yeah, he said no twice. Did someone die? Did someone get a trauma? Did you understand for the second time and backed off? Yes.\n\nIf it was a guy you were trying to pick up it would be different, there you cannot trust the other so being pushy is unjustified.\n\nThis is your relationship. Don't take advise from people who are woke teens here without any relationship experience and who think you need to ask consent every time you want to hold your partner's hand.\n\nIt's really annoying now how out of reality people are.",

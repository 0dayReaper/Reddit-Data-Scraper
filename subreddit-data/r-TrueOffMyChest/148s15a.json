    "postText": "Broke up with this guy almost a week ago over a small fight, he said I don\u2019t respect him and called it off. Haven\u2019t heard anything from him yet. I love him endlessly and so does he. But he\u2019s controlling and let\u2019s his head get to most unthinkable assumptions or red pill ideologies when he gets furious. He is a wonderful person, friend, hardworking, empathetic and what not. But the anger scares me &amp; how do I love him if I get scared? \nI miss him so much we experienced so many good things together. I wish to be in his future and take care of him, be a mom / wife / partner etc. After many years I found something promising and I believe in loving unconditionally because YOLO. \n\nAm I compromising my self respect? Am I trying to revive something which is not worthy? \n\nI don\u2019t know how to deal with this separation but I want to fix this. I want him to ask me to be his gf. It\u2019s been couple of months we dating and due to different thought patterns we fight sometimes. \n\nMy man is precious to me so please don\u2019t say anything bad to him. He has never abused me or anything. I need advice on how to bring peace in his life and make him feel comfortable being vulnerable with me.",

Especially when he said you don\u2019t respect him, when you clearly do. You sound like such a caring and loving person. \n\nAs for how to cope with this, speak with friends, take time to focus on yourself and stop trying to care, respect and love someone who clearly doesn\u2019t respect you in the same way.",

            "comment": "All I can\u2019t say is usually when people assume things in a relationship, they usually have done those things, or are thinking about doing those things. My ex would always assume that I\u2019m cheating or flirting with other guys (I never did), but he was flirting and cheated on my with my best friend. Same experience has happened with many of my friends. It\u2019s not always the case, but what they read, listen to, or participate in is usually the cause for their assumptions. I blame google tbh.",

            "comment": "When people love you, they will let you know. They won\u2019t leave you wondering for a week if they care. They will apologize for little fights and they will tell you that they care.\n\nYou sound like someone who loves and cares deeply for the people in your life. You also sound like someone who isn\u2019t used to this person\u2019s behavior. You\u2019ve probably never experienced anything like his anger or controlling actions before. It makes sense that you would want to make things work because no one else you\u2019ve interacted with acts like that, and you think if you just talk to him rationally, you can work things out together.\n\nUnfortunately, this person can\u2019t be reasoned or rationalized with because admitting that they are wrong is not an option for them. They will probably never genuinely apologize for anything they do to you. \n\nIf you choose to lay down your feelings and make things work, things will never change for you. You will learn how to avoid arguments by giving in to everything he says and does. He will never treat you with the love and affection you provide. Some people do this their whole lives. It will cause you a great deal of resentment and sadness. I hope you decide to choose yourself instead. A few weeks of sadness for a breakup are absolutely worth a lifetime without suffering.",

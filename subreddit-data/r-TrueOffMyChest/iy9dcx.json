It's like hiring a company who specializes in paying employees the lowest legal limit without having to hire lawyers and figure it out yourself.\n\nIT and security (as in security guards) are probably the two best examples of how companies fulfill the role of poster child for the scummy nature of contracting. Security often pays literal minimum wage to it's employees and I know plenty of tech that companies simply offer things like phone based tech support via minimum wage call centers. This is on top of the entirely separate issue of companies hiring contractors (usually through a large contracting company) on what is an essentially permanent basis to fill key roles. The government is especially good at this...hiring contractors to fill key roles which are critical to things like infrastructure (IT security anyone) while not maintaining or training their own employees in these areas while furthermore not integrating contractors in a way that allows them to strategically plan and deploy systems on a national level like permanent and loyal employees would.",

However, the actual job paid hourly, so if he didn't work a day, he didn't get paid for those hours. He kept careful track of his hours and OT and successfully sued. I don't know if he got just the overtime or additional compensation, but he was pleased with the outcome. \n\nEveryone should track their actual hours worked.

The HR then called me 5 mins after the interview was over to tell me that they want to put me thru to the final round with the Department Head for which I made time at the last minute. She negotiated the final salary with me and we agreed on a number - she did this because she did not want the Head to have her time wasted in case I don't agree to the salary. But after the interview with the Head, they ghosted me and haven't bothered to reply to my follow up email.\n\nUpdate: I spoke to my HR point of contact again. She said they can't afford me (after closing in on the salary negotiations) but the job is mine if I'm willing to work for what they have to offer which is slightly less than what I'm demanding. I can start as soon as 30th Sep. I rejected the offer.",

The hr department spent most of their time as a glorified party planning committee. I was interested in transferring to a different department and went through every channel I possibly could especially the salary hr rep. I could never get any communication from her until one day I saw he walking around the factory and I stopped her to ask her about it. She said she was still catching up from the company eclipse event from 3 week prior and hadn't gotten around to responding to me. I still never got much out of it after that either. The promotion and raise practices were terrible too. I spent 4 years in a position I was over qualified for and when I finally got a \"trial run\" for the position I was ultimately shooting for i spent 6 months doing the duties of that position without any sign of a real promotion with a raise before I eventually quit. People leave there regularly because they never offer advancement and they would rather let experienced employees walk and hire someone fresh out of college than offer promotions and competitive pay. At one point the most experienced person in several engineering departments besides managers had only 4 years of experience. Quitting that hell hole was the best decision I've ever made and I am much happier where I am now.",

But some folks go the extra mile and try to style it themselves, which just means we spend time stripping out all of all of their terrible google images clip art, comic sans and Impact fonts, off-brand colors, and awkward formatting. HR is always seems to be the worst offender with stuff like this. \n\nLike, I know they think they\u2019re making our job easier by doing some of the work for us, and I appreciate the effort, but they really should just leave it to us. Do you think they show up to the hospital for surgery having already cut themselves open, trying to save the surgeon some time?\n\nEdit: I just re-read this and it sounds mean. Just to be clear, I\u2019m not judging people in the office for having \u201cbad taste\u201d or anything. It\u2019s not part of their job description to have an eye for style; their job is to be experts in their department, and it\u2019s my job to make them look good. I wouldn\u2019t presume to know enough about their job to try to do it for them, and I just wish that was a two-way street.",

Just shoot me a DM.  Anyone for that matter.  I\u2019m a software dev and it took me quite a while to break into the industry (no degree, self taught) so I know some tips and tricks to get noticed.  Maybe nothing groundbreaking but I\u2019d be happy to lend a hand to folks having trouble like yourself.  Remember a few things too:\n\n1. Take care of yourself and make your mental health a priority\n2. This is not your fault, you just haven\u2019t found the right opportunity yet.  You will.\n3. Any day you wake up could be the day you find that opportunity, get that call, whatever.  It\u2019s hard but you can\u2019t frame this like you\u2019re sinking further and further into a hole.  Treat each day like the new opportunity it is to make small improvements, find opportunities, apply to them, chat with recruiters (they\u2019ll usually find you with a good LinkedIn profile), and leverage your network.  Keep morale high and when you feel doomed, refer back to rule #1.\n\nGood luck to you!",

I've had to take leave a few times already this year and they have been helpful and kind the entire time.\n\nThe team that handles employee training, though. What a shower of bastards. Most of the courses are online which is fine, but they require three in person courses (or Zoom meetings for this year) but make no concessions to the hundreds of us who work nights. So we wind up having to lose the bonus pay we get from working our specific shifts, will be groggy and grumpy the entire time, and the parking costs are four to six times more expensive and will not be reimbursed. \n\nAnd they don't make it easy to work around, either. If they'd schedule these meetings on a Monday or Tuesday then we'd just grin and bare it. Instead they insist on Thursdays and Fridays. You ever try switching your schedule from night to day back to night in single week? It's torture, I tell you. \n\nSo three times a year I get to sit in a conference room trying to stay awake long enough to get through a three hour shit show. My 'fun fact' for the last two years has been \"My name is weatherseed, I work 3rd shift in that one department everyone needs, and this course has cost me $300 because HR won't do this at night.\"",

I fought as much as I could regarding bullshit like this, which impacted myself just as much as my team. In the end, I did get some concessions like shift differential and training sessions at the start of 2nd shift and the end of 3rd shift to support my team, as well as gift cards in compensation for the team members when day shift got lunch catered once or twice a week (if I didn\u2019t order meals myself outright and occasionally delivered myself even when I moved to days - but meal choices are slim in the dead of night...).\n\nI still had plenty of frustrations and ended up taking a new job because of it. They wanted me to be on shift to supervise night shift, yet wanted me to be present during most business meetings and actions on days. When I did move to days I could not hire night shift supervisors. They\u2019d constantly dump work on night shift and complain when things didn\u2019t get done overnight by the overworked night shift skeleton crew. They\u2019d hire any warm body for the position, which had no support like HR, customer support, or senior engineer escalation points for clients that had 24/7 production times. These entry level guys were required to be experts with no safety net. And if one of them actually panned out to be a solid tech, they were vultured by day shift ASAP while I struggled to find hires (if they just didn\u2019t fill out the position without me by grabbing the first person off the street they could find). It took a long time to even get the minor wins above because they could not be convinced as to how much different things are on night shift, and why someone might not be keen to come in at 2pm for a culture event when that\u2019s essentially the middle of the night for them.  \n\nIt\u2019s often said that people should work retail to gain some empathy of the worker\u2019s plight. I\u2019d argue the same perspective is needed by everyone by spending some time on night shift.",

They asked her to leave right then, and weren't able to fill her position for 10 weeks, inconveniencing the whole team. Just disrespectful all the way around.

            "comment": "Having been on the other side of this, I can tell you that the hiring process at most companies these days is a bureaucratic mess and adds far more cost than it is worth.\n\nIt started out as a way to offload resources from managers/HR to 3rd parties such as staffing agencies.  The staffing agency filters out candidates and only submits qualified ones, and has a greater pool of candidates to choose from.  Simple, right?\n\nNowadays, they have internal and external systems that they load people's credentials/qualifications into to pre-scan and vet them, which in my opinion is very poor practice.  Qualifications-only hiring is a disaster because it takes the human element out.  I've had underqualified employees outperform the super-qualified ones in many instances.\n\nThe other side of things is the ugly legal factor.  The reason that many companies don't even bother informing applicants of the status is fear of legal recourse.  I have conducted many, many interviews.  A few years ago, I was pulled into a training for interviewing.  I was basically told that most of the questions I ask are no longer allowed because candidates can become offended and sue the company should we not hire them.  Some of these were age-old traditional questions you can ask about someone's previous work history, and suddenly I can't ask them?  At the end, I felt like all that I could ask about is the candidates name, where they worked in the past, and how they felt about the weather that day.\n\nIt's a mess.  Everyone runs around so permanently offended these days that it screwed up the hiring system...",

                    "comment": "I don't agree that \"everyone walking around being offended\" is the issue. Employers definitely try every tactic in the book to get the upper hand in salary and benefits negotiations, and usually do everything in their power to get the upper hand and pay you less. Case in point, it was made popular not to discuss salary, because of some social idea of not disclosing income and making people feel bad or some BS. When in reality it just served to allow employers to hire people for less than their worth because no one discussed pay. Once everyone started discussing salary and comparing, suddenly people realize certain groups are being unfairly discriminated against and now we are where we are.\n\nThis is not to say there aren't sue happy individuals who look for ways to screw over companies and get a fat settlement, but that's not the norm.\n\nOn the flip side, it happens all over where recruiters or someone from HR will ask you how much you're making and then offer you a slight bump higher, even though it's less than what you're worth it what the job offers. You'd know more than me about specific questions you can't ask, but I've been asked numerous times \"how much are you making\" and the only rational response is \"I don't feel comfortable answering that.\" I made about 35k less than I should have at my last job, and if we use that as the metric, I'll end up making 25k less than I should at the next. I didn't go into the workforce and get a specific degree to be \"slightly happier than my last job\" in terms of comp\n\nI've also been asked about previous positions, work history, and nature of the work I've done at very large companies, so unless they're REALLY playing fast and loose with the rules, then I don't see how you're \"not allowed to ask about work history,\" unless you meant something else. I've been asked at length about projects, situations in which I've disagreed with management, prompted for input about how I've dealt with conflict in the past, etc. So I'm not sure what questions you mean when you say you're not allowed to ask certain questions. I don't even see how you could ask anything more without delving into my personal life (which I've also been asked about)\n\nEverything else you said I 100% agree with. The system is messed up and you filter out genuine applicants using very draconian filtering methods that weed out candidates with \"not enough buzzwords\" on their resume. (At least in my field) And most 3rd party recruiters just siphon off the top without doing work. They're literally just a \"good resume delivery system.\" I literally had a recruiter take my resume, stamp his company's name on it, and set up an interview with a high profile bank without even calling me first and introducing himself. This wasn't a small recruiting company either. \n\nI don't have a conclusion to this wall of text, but that was my 2 cents, from someone who just spent 9 months unemployed (laid off RIGHT before Christmas) and job searching with various recruiters and companies across the spectrum. I think workers are just getting fed up of being bullied and having less protections than corporations",

    "postText": "Last year, I (male 17) went through the worst year of my life. I spent 8 days in the icu 6 of which I was unconscious and then 4 months after doing chemo and corticosteroids. Almost every day for 2 of these months nurses pinched needles to my arms because my veins were too weak to take treatments. My hands were bruised up to my elbows and I could walk for 2 months due to my illness and the long periods of lying on the hospital bed. The other two months I had a Hickman which I took all the medications from. What was the illness that required all that? Pediatric rheumatoid arthritis that caused a complication called macrophages activation syndrome. For the 4 months in the hospital I thought I would never go out again. I cried every day and thought of ending it all. The only reason I didn't do it was because of my dad. I thought that if he woke up and saw my dead body on the street outside the hospital he would go mad.\n\nFinally I left only to be locked at my room for the rest of the year due to my non existent immune system and covid. Still I thought of killing myself, I was a 16 year old boy who couldn't even go to the bathroom because I could get something from my family and die. I couldn't see my friends who were at school nor they had time to talk to me due to the way our school system works here (7 hours every day and 4-5 hours private tutoring and different homework for each lesson because school can't actually teach you anything here due to incompetent 70 year old teachers). Neither seeing nor talking to anyone for more than 10 minutes when my mom gave my a painful injection 3 times a day which I will be doing for the rest of my life led to my depression getting worse and worse. \n\nAfter that hole ordeal of a year I had to return to school wearing a mask and sitting alone in the corner of the class every day (after missing an entire year of school) and keep up with the others in order to get in a university not for me, but for my parent's insurance to keep covering my meds which keep all that from happening again. But that's not all, my parents work almost all day every day in order to keep us from starving because of the debt my hospitalisation put on the family, my brother always talks down on me and berates me for no reason and my older sister thinks and openly says that I'm a loser because I spend most of my free time playing videogames, my sister also hates me I'm not sure why, but she always hopes of the worst about me lately, for example I might get some money from the government because I have a certain percentage of disability and I overheard her talking to the phone saying she hopes I don't get it because I did nothing for it. There are many examples of her hatred towards me while I haven't really done anything to her and I actually like spending time together but as soon as I leave the room she keeps saying bad stuff about me. Also almost every day I have to deal with fights between my parents, my sister and brother. Videogames are the only thing I enjoy in my life and that is probably not going to change.\n\n Everyone who knows me treats me differently, my teachers just boosted my grades and ignored me all year, my friends treat me like I'm a different person and most of my family pretends to care about me but all they care about is me being here.\nThe only person that treats me normally is the guy that plays games with me once or twice a month because he doesn't know what I've been through.\n\nI don't know what to do anymore, I don't live for myself, I live for everyone else. My life is shitty, I can't pursue the job that I wanted to do because of my arthritis, I can't continue sports for the same reason and the only thing that keeps me from jumping out the window is my dad and my online friend who are the only people who care about how I actually feel.\n\n I should have died in that icu last year. In the two days that I was awake in there I remember the only thing I was thinking is how to end all the pain. But I couldn't, not because of my dad or anyone else, but because I was unable to move my body. If I died in the icu my family wouldn't have had to pay money for medical stuff, I would be spared of all the pityness from everyone and the hatred from my siblings. Life is bad for me right now and it probably won't get any better. The only thing I can do is keep living for everyone around me and keep doing what I enjoy the most even though I get judged for it by people.\n\nSorry If my English is bad, I'm not a native speaker.",

Sometimes thats all we need. \n\nSending you virtual hugs and an imaginary cake for making it one more year around this Earth and being here for yourself and everyone you love.",

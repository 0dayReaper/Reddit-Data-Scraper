    "postText": "So let me first just say, I\u2019m not the one in the wrong for this but I have to say it somewhere. It\u2019s eating me alive.\n\n2 years ago when I was 19 I met this woman while I was working as a personal trainer. She was in her 40s and looked like a 25 year old. She took an interest in me and invited me out a number of times and we had sex a few times. After one of our meet ups she said it was wrong for someone of her age to be with me because I was to young and changed gyms.\n\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for just under a year. She\u2019s amazing and I love her so much. 2 months ago I met her family for the first time and it was a shock. Like she took me to the house where i had hooked up with a woman and I felt like I was being pranked.\n\nBefore I see her mom it hits me. I have a type and they both fit that type so it make sense, I\u2019ve been hooking up with a single mom and I\u2019m now with her daughter. Then her mom and dad pop out and we both almost shit ourselves. i meet her parents, they\u2019ve been married for 20 years, I realize I had been a married woman\u2019s boy toy, I feel incredibly ashamed.\n\nLater that week her mom finds my number and tells me that I can never speak of what happened. She says that my girlfriend will hate me forever because I\u2019ll be the one who broke up her parents. So now I\u2019m stuck keeping this secret.\n\nShe invited me to spend thanksgiving and with her family and since my family is 1000 miles away and I already told her I don\u2019t plan on going home I don\u2019t really have an excuse to not go. So now I\u2019m going to have to sit there at a table and enjoy thanksgiving dinner with the woman I had an affair with, her husband, and her daughter whom I am now in love with. \n\nI\u2019m fucked.",

He doesn't have much luck, until one day, he comes across a Harley with a 'for sale' sign on it.\u00a0\r  \nThe bike looks better than a new one, although it is 10 years old. It's shiny and in great condition.\r  \nHe buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.\r  \n'Well, it's quite simple,' says the seller, 'whenever the bike is outside and it's gonna rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome as It protects it from the rain, and he\u00a0hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.\u00a0\r  \nThat night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents.\u00a0\r  \nNaturally, they take the bike there.\r  \nJust before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, 'I have to\u00a0tell you something about my family.\r  \n'When we eat dinner, we don't talk. In fact, the FIRST person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.'\r  \n'No problem,' he says.. And in they go.\r  \nJoe is shocked.Right in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes. In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks dirty dishes.\r  \nThey sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.\r  \nAs dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.\r  \nHe leans over and kisses Sandra.\r  \nNo one says a word.\r  \nHe reaches over and fondles her breasts. Nobody says a word.\r  \nSo he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table\u00a0and screws her, right there in front of her parents.\r  \nHis girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.\r  \nHe looks at her mom. She's got a great body too.\r  \nJoe grabs mom, bends her over the table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way but loose\u00a0right there on the dinner table.\r  \nShe has a big orgasm, &amp; Joe sits down.\r  \nHis girlfriend is furious, her dad is boiling, &amp; Mom is beaming from ear to ear. But still ... . Total silence.\r  \nAll of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.\r  \nJoe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.\r  \nSuddenly the father shouts.\r  \nI'll do the fuckin\u2019 dishes!!",

She wouldn't necessarily want the dad; she wants that guy from twenty years ago.\n\nI mean, if you date someone who's attractive, but you break up with for non-appearance reasons, you're not going to say, \"I'm not going to date that person who has all of the upsides and none of the downsides of my ex.\" That's an upgrade, or at least a reversion to the original version, before feature creep set in and you were left with a buggy piece of garbage that you couldn't stand to look at.",

GF will notice the awkwardness between you and her mom and for no reason in her eyes and she\u2019ll dig and dig until it comes out and then my friend is where it\u2019ll become really bad because you were holding out on telling her. Whatever you did before her is not her concern and you didn\u2019t know the mom was married, so do not let the mom control the rest of your relationship with GF because believe me, it will get a lot worse. I\u2019d talk to GF and tell her what happened now because that relationship IS OVER. Might as well finish it now before there\u2019s more feelings or even a child together and then shit hits the fan. And you never know, maybe GF will not blame you at all. But definitely tel her my friend. You have done nothing wrong here so why should you carry that tremendous amount of guilt.\n\nEdit:  thank you guys who corrected me. I swear, I always thought it was minus well. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc",

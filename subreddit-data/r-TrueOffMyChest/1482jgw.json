    "postText": "TLDR; A woman struggles with hirsutism\n\nI ( 32f) have been dealing with massive hormonal issues since I was 16 years old, likely due to extremely heightened cortisol levels during my traumatic childhood. I had one period at 16, then when I didn\u2019t get one exactly a month later my step mom screamed at me that I was a whore and was probably knocked up. I struggled with weight gain, was diagnosed with PCOS and Endometriosis, fatigue, now a recently diagnosed joint disorder that was being worsened by the hormonal birth control I was taking for over 10 years in an attempt to regulate my menstruation. \n\nBut, and maybe this is vain, but to me the worst wasn\u2019t the pain, the ER trips from waking up in pools of blood, the knees going out randomly or anything like that. \n\nTo me, the worst was the hirsutism that came with the hormonal imbalances. At 16, I started growing a full beard and mustache. It was crippling to my already nonexistent self confidence. I was already relentlessly bullied in school for being short and fat, but this only bolstered the arsenal. The bullying got so much worse. \n\nBy 17 I was shaving my arms, legs, stomach, and face. Unfortunately, the skin on my face is especially delicate and devastating, and can not handle a razor. the joint disorder that I was only recently diagnosed with also causes very soft, fragile, sensitive skin. I\u2019ve always been a bit of a slow healer, I would develop scars from minor cuts. \n\nI tried waxing, laser treatment, electrolysis. Eventually settled on plucking with tweezers, because that was least of all the evils. But my face HATED being So consistently touched, cleaned, messed with. It created thick scaly skin, constant rashes and acne problems. The worst was the ingrown hairs. I constantly was on the verge of infection because of the ingrown hairs. Nothing I could find or try worked, and I didn\u2019t until very recently have any health insurance and couldn\u2019t afford a dermatologist. So I sit in front of a mirror and carefully pluck my face every day with satirized tweezers and always hope for the best. \n\nFast forward to 2 months ago. I\u2019ve been making some new friends lately and I was hanging out with an RN friend of mine, and she mentioned that she noticed how irritated my face was all the time. At this age I have grown accustomed to it, kind of deadened to the pain of it all. I kind of flippantly explained my situation, and she asked what cleanser and moisturizer I used. I didn\u2019t use either, most soaps irritated the fuck out of the basically open wounds, and moisturizer always made the acne worse. I didn\u2019t look too hard for alternatives and stopped using both around 25 years old. \n\nShe suggested a very specific brand and I decided, fuck it, I\u2019ll try it. Picked them up, and followed her instructions of a cleanse and moisturize twice a day for a month to see what happened. \n\nBy the third day, most of the worse irritation had gone down. By the second week, the redness had gone down. A couple weeks ago, I stopped getting ingrown hairs!! Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m still growing a full beard and mustache, and the hairs come in waves so I still pluck every day, but I\u2019m no longer having to dig for uncomfortable ingrown hairs. And they\u2019re just sliding out without any discomfort. \n\nIt never occurred to me that the hairs would find their way through the skin better if the skin was healthier, I kind of always assumed that the hair was causing the skin irritation and there was nothing I could do. \n\n## Every day I wake up, I look in the mirror and I stand there in shock for a moment because I finally look beautiful to myself, for truly the first time in my adult life. My skin is the healthiest and happiest it\u2019s ever been, and I feel stupid knowing that there was an easy solution out there and I just got used to the discomfort and didn\u2019t try too hard to find a different answer.\n\nAnd thank goodness to my friend who noticed. She\u2019s been so helpful and kind, I really appreciate her.",

    "postText": "I (42F) wanted to see if anyone has had experience or advice for recovering from a family split. I posted a few times earlier this year about how my dad was diagnosed with cancer and decided to proposition me for intimacy as a death bed/bucket list situation. \n\nMy dad died mid-April and I've been processing everything with my therapist and family. There was no funeral. Just went straight ahead for cremation after a quick viewing for any friends of the family. There's been some tension between my older brother and I. Initially OB was accepting and supportive of my choice to go no contact after I told him about the situation with dad, but as more time has passed he's become resentful of me. \n\nHe and I got in a huge argument a few nights ago and he blamed me for dad's quick deterioration. He thinks that because I cut him off, the stress accelerated the progression. I don't necessarily disagree that it might have contributed, but I also don't believe it's my fault. Dad made the choice to ask me to have intimacy with him. Dad decided after his diagnosis was the perfect time to ask me for something unforgivable, while I was more vulnerable and more willing to do things for him. \n\nI know time is required to heal these wounds but I've decided to go low contact with him. My younger brother is completely on my side and is just as frustrated with my brother. Logically I understand what he's feeling. My dad was his best friend. They were together nearly everyday and he has never had to live a life without our father. \n\nBut LB and I are in pain too and I wish he could understand. I don't know where to go from here. I just know posting on this sub in the past gave me alternative perspectives and some good advice.",

Everybody dies eventually. \n\nThird, your brother is looking for someone to blame, he cant blame the illness he cant see but he could blame the one person who didnt fulfil your father last request. Your brother (probably) looks at that terrible offer as some sort of 'magic cure' that would have lifted his spirits and your dads illness would have just gone away in days and then he would have gotten his precious father back. Obviously, none of that would of happened, hes just looking for someone to blame. Im not saying he gets a free pass to be ok about such a horrendous request nor his following behaviour, but being upset about a loved ones passing is understandable. Being upset with you for his passing is less so understandable. \n\nI dont have any advice on how to move forward, other than saying that you dont have to speak with that brother (or anyone who agree with the request) if you dont want to. \n\nIm sure you are a lot of wonderful things and in possession of a  lot of great qualities but doubt that your in possession of a magical cancer curing vagina. so...",

Not because of the possessions left behind but because there was drug addiction in one of the siblings and a lot of things came out during the grieving process. \n\nMy Papa passed very suddenly and then 7 weeks later my Gran did. No one had time to grieve the loss of one before the other went so it was just a really dark and difficult time. \n\nIt took years before I got used to no more get togethers. And the ones we did have were strained because some siblings weren't talking to the others etc and anyone who still tried to keep a relationship with the others were always caught between their shit. \n\nIt's been 22 years and we never recovered. Rifts were continued and some more happened. Including between me and my Mom and she passed away Christmas morning last year. \n\nIt's not easy to go through. But eventually you learn to love with it and cherish the memories you have. \n\nI'm sorry you were thrust into such a position with your Dad. It must have been mentally traumatic for you and I can only imagine how difficult it would have been to face what your dad was asking of you. \n\nYou're grieving the loss of his life and the innocence a daughter has with her Dad. It can't be an easy thing to wrap your mind around. \n\nI really hope that in time, your family learns how to pull through this and not wind up like mine. It's a tragedy.",

He\u2019s choosing a self indulgent position of blame because he chooses to, if he can\u2019t do better he may also have something indecent going on you don\u2019t know about.\n\nA person who would even think that way, that you could\u2019ve/should\u2019ve/would\u2019ve or ever might\u2019ve, I dunno, led him on through his death to make it easier? Actually fucked him to make it easier through his death? There\u2019s something seriously wrong with your brother and if you ever have children you would be foolish to ever trust them alone. The minute he blamed you, he invited suspicion onto himself which he needs to disprove before trust should ever come his way. I\u2019m sorry you have fam like this, I do too, and you never really realize how twisted they are until some of their expectations for you, of how to handle sex abuse from a father figure, \u201cshould\u2019ve gone\u201d in their view.\n\nTbh, I hope your younger brother doesn\u2019t procreate either, until he works out how to be a human, because he didn\u2019t have a father who taught him (or any of you) how to do that. You sound reasonable, and decent, and immeasurably strong: keep up therapy and of course compartmentalize as you have been doing, it does help.

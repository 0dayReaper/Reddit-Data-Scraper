    "postText": "I (26f) just got back from a 14hr drive across several states to see my best friend (35f) and her family,  but the way she made me feel was really bad. We have been friends since I was 18, she helped me through an abusive ex, I've watched her kids grow up, I've helped her where and what I could and we remained close after I moved out of state(2016). About 6 months ago her and her family moved 14 hours away from me and I haven't seen her since other than in video calls. The reason I made this trip is because her other friend (34f) was taking her child to spend the summer so she could make some moves to improve their lives. I volunteered to help drive because I miss my friend and I knew a trip that long would be really hard on 1 driver with a small kid. \n I took the whole 14 stint by myself because her friend didn't want to drive in the night.  We had car troubles and it was scary and hard,  it's the longest either of us has ever driven.  I was exhausted by the time we got there after only having shut my eyes for a small 30 minute nap. I felt that my needs had been pushed aside and the only one who cared was her daughter who made up her own bed for me to sleep in.  I just went in the bed and cried until I fell asleep. \n My friend didn't have clean sheets, towels for us, or even a pillow. We had to use towels that had already been used and if I had known I would've brought my own.  \n She kept asking me for money and expecting me to pay for things like dinners for everyone and tickets to a water park for everyone, even though I made it clear I only brought 100$. I lost my job in October due to chronic pain and haven't been working, my boyfriend supports me and she knows this. \n Her friend and I pitched money (30$) together for some bud so we could smoke and hang out, then she only let us smoke half the bag and hid the rest for herself and her husband, while loading the leftover roaches for us to smoke. She also took and hid a wax tool I purchased because she liked it, I tried looking for it before we left and it was nowhere to be found, this isn't the first time I've thought she maybe took something small, or later found something of mine that I didn't give her which I usually let go because she has gone through hard times.   \n  On top of all that there was no food in the house so I had to buy food so everyone could eat, i got 2 meals for 7 people. I think the whole trip I only slept about 3 hours over 4 days. On the last day before we left I was stuck watching the 3 kids by myself for probably 4 hours,  which isn't a big deal because I love them,  but there was hardly any food and they didn't like what I made and didn't eat it.  When she got back she was stomping around and acting hostile and it was causing me so much anxiety I kept asking her what was wrong and how could I help, all she would say was she just had \"focused energy\", which I just let go and kept to myself mostly for the rest of the night,  I was feeling really low. \n  Before she went to bed she asked us to wake her before leaving so that's what I did, it was around 4:30am and she got up  just acting quietly angry towards me and only really talking to her other friend. We we left her friend got a long emotional hug with lots of kind and loving words, all I got was a small side hug and a \"love you,  be safe\". I just was so upset the whole way back which I also drive most of and I just kept thinking the whole time \"why did I even come? \" which my best friend shouldn't make me feel that way. \n I don't really even know what to do with this,  I don't want to be treated like this but I also don't want to lose my friend and I don't know how to talk about it with her without getting gaslit about how I feel.  She's one of the last people from my old life that stayed by my side and I feel like I just don't know how to let go. Thank you guys for reading all this,  I just needed to get it off my chest.",

            "comment": "I also had a very unhealthy friendship once that I held onto for dear life and desperately did not want to lose. She was one of my only friends as I never socialized, so I was terrified of ending up alone and friendless. Much like how you described, my old \u201cfriend\u201d also often made me feel unwanted to the point where I wondered why I was even invited sometimes. Eventually, despite my efforts we ended up cutting each other off completely. \n\nWhile it was definitely devastating at first, it helped me realize who was important to me and who might have just been taking advantage of me. Throughout the whole falling out my cousin was there for me through every step and she was my rock. She is now to this day my very best friend and I would never trade her for anything. You most definitely have someone in your life that cares about you a lot more than you think they do. Cut off this \u201cfriend\u201d immediately, and you\u2019ll know exactly who\u2019s there for you and who\u2019s not.\n\nOf course it\u2019ll be hard at first and you\u2019ll miss them. You were friends for years after all. However, in my experience you start to miss them less and less and start to forget about them more over time. Making new friends and creating new memories helped a lot, so please stay open to meeting new people and making new friends! Do not close yourself off from others like I did. After cutting my \u201cfriend\u201d off, over the months I also did a lot of reflecting on our friendship and what went wrong, and there were just so many red flags that I ignored because I was so desperate to not end up alone and friendless.\n\nThis month marks 1 year since we cut each other off, and I can say that I am a lot more confident with myself than I was before. Friends like them who, intentionally or not, constantly put you down and make you feel invisible are not worth the time and effort whatsoever. Now that she\u2019s no longer in my life I am 100x more confident since she is no longer there to constantly drag me down. You may miss your friend at first too, but eventually it will feel like a weight has lifted off your shoulders. Best of luck to you and I\u2019m here for you if you ever want to talk! You can definitely get through this I believe in you! Sorry I couldn\u2019t offer much advice as everyone\u2019s experience with these kinds of things is always different, but I hope everything works out. People like this are never worth the time or energy, and you\u2019re a lot better off without them. &lt;3",

Like she told me I could not put one small item in her fridge when I had no electricity. She insisted there would be no room. And she got mad that I charged my phone at her house. \n\nI just walked away 3 years ago this week. I hope she realizes what a good friend I was. I know she will never apologize, though. \n\nAgain, I feel for you.",

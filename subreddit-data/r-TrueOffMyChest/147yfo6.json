    "postText": "This will probably be somewhat long but because I have a lot to say and a long story to tell. My problems and anxiety have only started recently but to be honest I think I can trace the start of this to about 3 years back, at the start of 2020. I will do my best to keep this is short as I can because I know no one wants to read a novel but I do tend to ramble and go off in a million different directions, but I will do my best to keep it short and coherent. This has been building for a long time now and I just need to tell someone about it, so here we go.  \nThere is a TLDR at the end for those who don't want to read this novel (I understand).  \nSo like I said I guess the best place to start would be the beginning of 2020. At that time I had just turned 21 (my birthday is in January) and I was in the second semester of my first year in university. Everything was going fine. I felt like I was on the right track with the way my life was supposed to be going. Everything was okay. At the time I lived in Florida but my family had just moved to South Carolina in February, so the plan was that I was going to go up there to meet them on my spring break, go back to school, finish the semester, and then move back up there with them and enroll in a new school there to be close to them.  \nWell, as you can probably guess, that didn't happen. I did go there for my break, but then a week turned into a month, which turned into permanently. Yeah, thanks Covid. While I was there, my school shut down, at first just for a few weeks, but then they announced that they were moving the rest of the semester online, and we had to go clean out our dorms and go back home. I never got to say goodbye to my friends either. I thought I'd only be gone a week, and then just like that, I never saw them again. I haven't seen or talked to them in 3 years.  \nSo a series of weird things happened. We tried to follow the plan we had originally set, but it didn't work out. Since we had only just moved to SC, the university would too expensive to go to with out of state tuition, so instead I just enrolled in another semester of online classes at my old school. Except, I only enrolled in 2 classes because I was going to try to work on the side, but that ended up not happening because I ended up in another situation instead.  \nSo now it's early 2021 and we end up moving again so now I'm in a different state. I finish up my year of online stuff and try again to enroll in a school nearby so I can finally stop doing online stuff. This time, it works. Also around this time, in \\~March 2021, on a whim, I decide to start learning French. I did it because I tried doing it in high school but it didn't really work out, but now I wanted to try. I end up meeting some people from France on twitter and we became pretty good friends.  \nSo Fall 2021, I start school again and at this point I had been learning French for about 6 months and I was okay at it (couldn't speak to save my life but I could write and read okay, sometimes my friends and I texted in French). At this point I was feeling pretty bored with everything that was going on in my life and I decided one day \"hey I wonder if my school has any study abroad programs in France.\" Well, they did. And it was at this point that I knew what I wanted to do. I talk it over with my parents and they all agreed that it was a great idea, so in March 2022 I applied and in April I got the email letting me know I was accepted. Holy shit!! I'm going to France!! I thought that such a chance in my life as moving to a whole different country for a year would give me some perspective on what I wanted to do with my life and give me a solution as to why I was feeling so bored. So over the summer I worked everything out, and then, on August 23rd, 2022, I got on a plane and went to France.  \nI love France. It's an amazing country, absolutely beautiful and everyone was very nice to me. I honestly don't know where the stereotype that French people are mean comes from because that wasn't my experience at all. Maybe it's because I didn't stay in Paris. I had such a wonderful time there and met so many great people. It was really great to be able to outside, walk to a park and sit in the sunshine, or take a short walk to the town square to meet my friends for coffee or food. That's something you can't do where I live.  \nWhile I was in France, during one of my breaks from school, I took advantage of the closeness and went to Ireland for a week. I was super excited about it because I've always wanted to go to Ireland since way before I wanted to go to France and now it was much easier because of how close it was. It felt like the opportunity of a lifetime since I had no idea if I would ever be this close again. Ireland is also a fantastic place. I wish I could've stayed longer. Unlike for the French people, the stereotype about Irish people definitely holds up. Everyone I met was so nice and helpful to me, and plus it was nice to be able to take a break from French for a bit and actually sound like a competent person again lol.  \nAfter the week I went back to France and continued with the second semester. I got back home in mid May. I was home for a week, then I went to visit some family I hadn't seen in a while. I'm here now and I go back tomorrow.  \nIf you've read this far, thank you. That's all the background for what led up to this situation I currently find myself in. Here's the problem (well problems):  \nNow that I'm back home, I'm really lonely again. Ever since I left my school in Florida when Covid happened, I haven't had any irl friends. I met plenty of people I now consider to be good friends online when that I was all I could do during covid and they remain my friends now. That's one reason why France was so great. I finally had friends again that I could actually meet with. It felt great. Now that's all gone again. When I started going to in person school again in 2021, I tried making friends several times but they all ended up ghosting me at some point. I thought maybe moving to the main campus of my school would help things since it's bigger and the main campus thus more chances to meet people. Well I tried that and found out a few weeks ago that I basically can't do that because there's no housing space available because I took too long to apply. It's in a different city so if I'm going to go to that campus, I basically need housing there or else I can't do it. I'm really annoyed and upset by this because I never received any email or communication at all telling me about a deadline and when I went purposely looking for it I couldn't find it anywhere, so I don't even know when the deadline actually was. I'm assuming I was supposed to do it at the beginning of the year but at that time I wasn't even thinking of that because I was focused on my school in France. So now I'm just annoyed and upset that I screwed up my plan because by the time I even thought about it, it was too late. Now I'm probably going to have to go back to the small campus in my town that I was going to and I'm worried I won't be able to get housing there too and I'll have to live with my parents.  \nThe second thing is that people keep asking me when I'm going to graduate, how much time do I have left. I get it's a reasonable question but it makes me nervous to answer because I don't even know anymore. Ever since covid and the only semester I did where I only took 2 classes, everything has been screwed up. I think I have a year left or maybe a year and a semester but I don't even know anymore. I feel embarrassed because one of my friends who's younger than me is graduating before me when I started before her. I feel like I can't tell my parents because they'll get upset with me and my Grandma (who's paying for it all) would probably kill me. She already seemed upset when I saw her a few weeks ago. When I told her I had one more year, she said \"how do you have one more year?? You're 24 aren't you??\" and I just felt ashamed. I felt like everything just got so out of hand and I have no idea what's going on anymore. Everything seemed so certain, like I was doing the right thing and I had it all under control and then covid happened and messed everything up. Nothing has been right since then.  \nThe other thing is I'm not even sure if I even like what I'm studying anymore. I feel like I'm a completely different person from who I was when I started and I really have no motivation or interest in doing it anymore. I know I should finish, especially after all the money everyone in my family has sank into it for my benefit, so I feel extremely guilty that they've done all this for me and I've just screwed it all up. In addition, the study abroad advisor emailed me today telling me that they were having trouble transferring my credits because the school in France didn't send them the right stuff so now I'm just extremely stressed out that my year in France won't even count towards graduation because if that's true then I'll just be completely and utterly royally screwed and I won't even know what to do then. I won't even be able to explain the guilt that I'd feel if I found out that all the money my family pooled together for me to be able to have that opportunity just went down the drain basically.  \nBut for some reason while I've been on this vacation, I've become extremely terrified at the idea of going back to school. I guess it's because of all this pressure. Like the fact that I'm barely even interested in it anymore, and the fact that I'm worried about housing and credits... Nothing feels certain anymore. I feel like I've lost the path years ago and I've just been blindly stumbling along for years now.  \nAnd so here's the thing. (This is the last point). Ever since I've gotten back (and even before), I've been considering maybe trying to move back to Europe at some point just because I liked it so much there. I just liked the way things were there compared to here. The cities are so nice and beautiful, everything is connected and easily accessible... here where I live it's just ugly and you need a car for everything. So recently while I've been here I've been thinking a lot about my trip to Ireland and how much I liked it there. And for some reason it's morphed into something a lot more.  \nFor the past few days, I've been unable to get the idea of potentially moving to Ireland out of my head. This isn't the first time I've thought about it, but for some reason it's become a borderline obsessive thought, to the point where it's actually starting to bother me that I keep thinking about it. I feel stupid and naive for even thinking it's possible. I mean, it is something I possibly want to do, but considering my current situation it feels silly even thinking about. I mean, I'm an American and it's really hard for non-EU citizens to live there just because there's so much competition for jobs and why would a company choose me and make things difficult when they could just hire an Irish or European person and it make it much easier on themselves? And the idea just seems so silly. Part of me wishes I could do it but the skeptical part says its ridiculous to even think about. It says \"it's probably not what you think it is\" \"you'd probably hate it if you really went there.\" So I just don't know, I don't know where all of this came from but I just really don't want to leave my uncle's house and go back to my real life because I'm just so stressed and scared of everything that I'll have to deal with when I get back.  \nI miss when things were easy and I didn't have so much stress going on. I miss when I felt like I was going on the right track. But these past few months have just been so stressful for me because it feels like I just woke up and all of the sudden I'm faced with the reality of having to make something of myself and decide what I want to do and I just have no idea what to do at all. I feel like my parents won't help either, they'd probably just laugh or tell me to deal with it or something and tell me I'm making a big deal out of nothing and that life for them was easy for them at my age so why am I complaining? I should just figure it out. Except I don't know what to do and I'm stressed. I feel like everything is falling apart in front of me. I'm starting to worry that going to France made things a lot worse than better.  \nIf you've read all of this, I truly, truly thank you. You're awesome. Please give me any advice you have because I really need it at this point.  \nTLDR: I felt like my life was on the right track and everything was going right until covid happened and everything got messed up. I moved a lot, took only 2 classes one semester, didn't get enough credits and then I did a study abroad in France and now that I'm back I'm having a sort of crisis of what I want to do with my life. I'm worried I won't graduate on time, my credits from France might not transfer, and I'm really not that interested in what I study anymore and part of me doesn't even want to continue anymore. I kind of want to move back to Europe (maybe Ireland) but I feel stupid for even thinking it because it feels like such a naive idea and I probably can't even do it anyway. I'm visiting my uncle and I'm really stressed out about going home because I'll have to deal with all this stressful stuff and I don't know what to do.  \nSorry for any misspellings or grammatical errors, I've done my best but I'm terrible at typing and I'm not reading back through all of this.",

Start from that and don't hesitate to be proud of the little achievements you can get.\n\nMoving to Europe is not a bad thing to do and diplomas are in most cases just defining your first salary. \n\nYou have the power of internet in the palm of your hand and with time you can do anything, but you have to accept failure as part of your path to happiness",

I feel like in reality it's probably best for me to graduate because I don't want to disappoint my family with all the money they've sunk into it, and it's probably just a good idea for future jobs. I guess the other thing is I just feel kind of stupid and embarrassed because I guess I'm realizing I don't know how to run my own life because everything up until now was basically a path I was set on by others and I just went with it because I didn't know what else to do. I guess the France thing was the first time I did something myself but I don't know... I just don't know where to go from here. It's kind of embarrassing to realize that you're a full grown adult and I still can't direct my own life. I think that's also a part of where all my stress is coming from because I feel embarrassed and stupid for being my age and being in this situation.",

We're trying our best, some are more confident than others but that doesn't change the fact that the future is unpredictable and scary!",

I don't know if my French is good enough to live there. Making friends is hard enough for me, add a language barrier in and I'm not sure how well that would work out. I have thought of it though. Maybe. Another place I'm considering is Ireland since I quite like that place and no language problems there.",

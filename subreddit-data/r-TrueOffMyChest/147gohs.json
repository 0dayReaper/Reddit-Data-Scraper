    "postText": "There's this girl on Instagram that I find attractive and I figured, let's talk to her. So I commented on her post, I saw some other people commenting too(whom she didn't follow back) and her replying and liking, so I figured she's open to starting conversations.\n\nI typed a joke about her caption and photo, it was about realism and her not falling off the cliff she was. Apparently it sounded creepy so she replied with a plain face, didn't like my comment too.\n\n\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I had no idea it was a bad joke. I tried commenting something else appreciating the caption and introduced myself in dm's, while she's replying to other people and ignoring me.\n\nWelp,I guess I lost my chances with this girl.Sigh.",

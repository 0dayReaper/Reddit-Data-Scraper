    "postText": "Ex wife (37 f) cheated with a coworker who she knew for all of three months. Threw away a ten year relationship and seven years of marriage. Thank goodness there were no kids involved.\n\nAfter I caught her she insisted it was only an emotional affair and no sex. I didn\u2019t believe her and threw her out. So of course she blames me for running to the guy and moving in with him!\n\nOur divorce was finalized a year ago. Guess who shows up at my house yesterday night telling me she\u2019s still in love with me and she\u2019ll do anything I want to make it up to me. Turns out her dream man who she barely knew was banging some 19 year old on the side and has massive debts he hid from her.\n\nI told her all I want is her out of my life and to leave because my girlfriend was on her way over and the last thing I needed was her getting there and finding my ex wife there. Then I told her exactly what I think of her and pulled no punches.\n\nSo now once again I\u2019m the bad guy. She hurt me, now I hater her so that makes her the victim. What a narcissist.",

You did the right thing. I\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t take her back. \n\nShe only knew the dude 3 months ? Wow, she needs to go find herself. Alone.

People who cheat, both men and women, usually do it because they lack something deeply important that more intelligent and happy people have. Like emotional maturity and actual connection. Living like that must feel very empty. And they try to fill that void with others instead of growing or working on themselves. Unfortunately, their self-destructive behaviors often end up hurting others.",

She almost died in childbirth about a year and a half/two years after the final break up and was left without the ability to have more. But wait, there's more! Recently, the kid was taken from her for reasons I don't know. I completely cut her and her family out after that call, so anything I know was heard through the grapevine.\n\nWhile I do take everything I've heard about her with a grain of salt, I just can't stop the smirk of satisfaction that sneaks across my face every time I hear something new.",

I would be fucking furious everytime i think of them. Just because hes not fuckin budda and \"feels indifferent\" to it doesnt mean hes caught up on her. Hes mad because its a shitty thing to do and makes her a shitty person and shitty people make people mad.\n\nPlus she came back into his life just to basically give him shit.

When I was 17, I started dating someone I really shouldn\u2019t have been involved with (this is one of only two regrets of my life) and he cheated on me from day 1 because of how insecure he was, along with taking most of his insecurities out on me and suppressing me. I was young, stupid and too attached to leave (no clue why I was that way) and stayed for a few years but I never forgave him for that and decided this relationship would not last, I just felt too stuck to leave. When I was a little older I cheated on him, to get back at him for the years of cheating, abusing me, and treating me like crap. One of my friends found him on tinder a few years into our relationship, when I couldn\u2019t even contemplate being with anyone else, I found romantic messages he sent random girls that he never sent me, and I remember, once, he even made a motion like he was gonna slap me in front of my friend just because I wanted to introduce them to each other- he humiliated me for years. My second regret was cheating in retaliation because I am a loyal person, without a doubt, but when you\u2019re a child and give all your love to someone, only for them to take it for granted and try to make you insecure, and abuse you, you make dumb choices. Anyways, I wish I had the balls you did when I was 18 to leave! I\u2019m proud of you for finding someone better and letting your ex be with who she thought was better than you! Cheating is a horrible thing to do to someone and it causes a lot of insecurities,  if you don\u2019t want that person, just leave. But I guess that\u2019s easier said than done because for me, leaving a toxic and horrible and abusive relationship was almost impossible till there was no other option. Don\u2019t get back with your ex. You deserve better and I know you will have it, you didn\u2019t deserve to be betrayed.",

I wouldn't put an adulterer in prison but in a very good society a person like that would be shunned/shamed by everyone.\n\nOTOH a person that commited murder, I can't in good conscience be ok with anything less than the death penalty.  At the same time I am partly against the death penalty because it's finality in at least what we can conceive of as our existence and at that point a person no longer has the option of repentance.\n\nRepentance is the only thing that holds me back from being 100% ok with the death penalty for severe crimes.",

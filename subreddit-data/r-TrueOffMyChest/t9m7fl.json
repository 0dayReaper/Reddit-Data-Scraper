    "postText": "I (14M) have a bone disease known as Multiple Hereditary Exostoses (MHE). It causes benign bone tumors to grow everywhere on my body. Although they aren't cancerous, they are very painful when they are near a nerve. \n\nA lot of these tumors have grown in my knees, fingers and ribs. You can probably guess there are a lot of nerves and muscles there that can be pinched and pierced. It hurts quite a lot. I am constantly at level 5 pain (scale of 1-10). I can only walk for up to 2 minutes, I can't write (with a pen, if I couldnt type this post wouldnt exist lol) and I'm basically in agony.\n\nWe have decided I will go for surgery to saw off some of the most painful tumors in my knee. Hopefully this will restore my ability to walk. The doctors have also decided we should remove 2 of my ribs, which have cracked due to the tumors. They'll be replaced with metal I think.\n\nThere is a 20% chance of death with all these very complicated procedures, and of course a chance this surgery doesn't change anything, or even makes it worse. Rolling a less than 6 sided dice to determine if I live or die. But to be honest, I don't really care what happens in this surgery.\n\nIf it works, great, I can walk again. If it fails and my condition stays the same/deteriorates, I've adapted to this disease enough. I can probably handle a few turns for the worst. And if I die, well, I suppose then there is no more pain.\n\nMy friends say it is wrong for me to feel okay about dying. I'm not suicidal, I wouldn't kill myself if I had the chance. But I don't exactly care if I die at this point. It's in fate's hands at this point.\n\nComment anything, in 7 hours, I'll be on the operating table that'll determine my destiny.\n\nEDIT: Soon about to enter the operating room. Welp, this is it. Let's see our fate\n\nEDIT 2; I'M ALIVE, LES GOOOO. Recovery pain's a bitch but otherwise, I'm fine\n\nEDIT 3: Here is a post showing an extremely large update. https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/tsroac/update_3_weeks_ago_i_might_have_died_now_im_alive/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share",

They were really big but in couple of days after the surgery i was slowly walking again. Today, more than 20 years later everything is still fine even though i have some more tumors left. After i stopped growing, they stopped growing. I guess what i am trying to tell you is to be brave and not give up. It will be better, you are stronger than the disease. \n\nP.s. I'm not an english speaker so sorry for mistakes :)",

But that is it on the head of a nail if I ever seen one.\n\n\nOne day we\u2019ll all be dead, and they call sleep the cousin of death for a reason. I\u2019d like to think that when we die, since we can\u2019t be aware of non existence after we die. I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s like going to sleep, like a blink..who knows.\n\nWe may have a chance at another life in another time, we might not. Hell we might be like the eternals and go back to some soul forge to have our memories wiped out before being sent back to earth, we may not and may just be a decomposing set of bio organic materials rotting and being recycled into simpler substances once were buried, or, turned to ash if you prefer cremation. \n\n\nIn any case, I feel like to live a full life, like OP, you have to accept your mortality. And I feel like that\u2019s not something we do readily, I haven\u2019t accepted it. Fuck if I died tommorow I\u2019d come back as a ghost LOL! (Just some goofy humor) but really.\n\nDeath scares the shit out of me. I think that once we accept that one day, we\u2019ll die, one day, we will cease to exist in the way we know and have been familiar with. Life becomes better- in accepting death I think you have to accept that life isn\u2019t serious, everything is temporary, nothing lasts forever, and we\u2019ll all be forgotten in some sense thousands of years from now. Studied as ancient history or referred too briefly as a group belonging to a bygone civilization like the Roman\u2019s. \n\nI mean, do you know the names of your family members 6-7 generations back? Hell I don\u2019t even know past the 3rd generation. \n\nBut point in saying that. Is that, does all the stupid shit that we put so much emotional currency in, that we worry about, the opinions we care too much about, The negativity of someone experienced in a moment, a presentation, hanging onto embarrassing moments we don\u2019t need to hang onto anymore\u2026\n\nThat\u2019s the kind of stuff I think radical acceptance frees you from and I want to be free.",

Yes.  100%.\n\nHe just told me that due to advances in just about everything in a modern OR (procedures for your particular condition, equipment, training, pre-op planning due to better tech from imaging tech, etc\u2026.), there\u2019s a very high chance you\u2019ll come out of this with less pain than before (after rehab).  \n\nRemember, those numbers are based off of decades of doctors needing to do something to those kids; and they have to tell you the historical numbers.  Those 20% poor souls were stepping stones that lead up to you.  Those kids didn\u2019t die in vain because your doctors and the staff\u2019s skills have learned from these case studies and WILL provide you with the best experienced care.\n\nObviously, there\u2019s always a chance of complications with any type of surgical procedure.  But don\u2019t worry about it.  That team will do its best and I truly believe you\u2019re in great hands; because seeing my brother just power through with absolute determination to go through that intense ped-ortho training/residency weeds out even the best surgeons of this planet.  Whoever suffered through the classes, training, and hard work to become THE pediatric-ortho surgeon of your region is pretty much guaranteed to be among the top quality surgeons in the world who are always surrounded by an all-star support staff.\n\nI\u2019ll see you in a few hours buddy.",

Just want to let you know that, while they experience the odd pain, they're all currently living healthy normal lives. You're making the right decision going for surgery as far as quality of life goes. Feel free to reach out after if you need someone to talk to or if you need anything, I can get you in touch with a few people in the world who've been through what you're going through, as it's an incredibly rare disease.",

I appreciate the doctors have to tell you all the risks. But don\u2019t over rotate around that. And it sounds like you\u2019ve achieved the right zen level of acceptance - a maturity beyond your years that will support you well in the many years to come.

I think it's very mature to think that way, it's your place in the universe. There's something on the other side, we just don't know what it is.\n\nI'll tell you a little story that hopefully relates and you might understand better than others at the moment. I had my appendix rupture, went toxic, almost died. Got out of surgery then had to fight off infection to stay alive. When I was getting ready to go into surgery I felt this overwhelming calm hit me and I knew I didn't need to worry, if I die then I die and that's ok. There's nothing I can personally do to not die. It was one of the most relieving feelings I've ever had. And if I come out the other end, then all I need to worry about is recovering....all the other BS is just that, BS. I guess what I'm saying is that it can be quite peaceful to be in that situation and not many people will understand you in that situation. Good luck, we're all counting on you to come out the other end.",

Just tell everyone who asks that you were bitten by a shark or fought off a grizzly or something like that. Or, you can tell them that a team of people in masks cut you open to harvest your parts.

I had brain surgery on my cerebellum and upper spine and I died on the table 3 times. I then got an infection in the surgery site in my brain and ended up back in the hospital leaking csf out of my head and neck and fever of 105. I lived in horrible pain and seizures etc for 5 years before I was even diagnosed with doctor after doctor telling me I was crazy, depressed, a drug seeker etc. no one believed me. A neurosurgeon finally caught it on an mri and I had the surgery to remove the excessive brain tissue that had attached itself to my spine. But the damage was done and now the discs in my neck are crumbling so constant agony every day.\n\nWhen I went in for the surgery there was a big chance of death or brain damage. I was so done with the pain already I honestly had no fear left of dying because all I could think was no more pain. I had 2 young kids at the time and everyone told me I was crazy and selfish. What about the girls, your parents, etc? But they didn\u2019t have a clue what the last 5 years had been like or what the rest of my life I was going to be facing. \n\nIn the end though I did live and I am glad that I did because despite my pain I have had happiness and joy. I believe you are going to live. I wish you all the best and I fully understand where you are coming from.",

    "postText": "I dated my ex for 2 years, the relationship couldn't have been more toxic. Neither of us were okay mentally and could not take care of each other. However they were extremely abusive towards me, both verbally and psychologically, and I always just sucked it up and kept quiet, always defended them when people would talk badly.\n\nWhen we broke up it was extremely messy and it involved another person, yes, it is exactly what you think. After I called ex out they got extremely understanding and took everything I said extremely well, even though I was making a scene in public, they remained extremely calm. And no more than 2 weeks later they were dating.\n\nNow, call me stupid if you want but I remained friends with this ex because that's what most abusive relationships do, you cannot let them go no matter what. They constantly broke my boundaries by talking over and over about how lovely their new partner was and that just made me sick, however then they started talking about how their partner wouldn't talk to them, or they would fight like we did, huge fights over small things, or about how verbally abusive they are, etc.\n\nWell, I can proudly say that I no longer care about that. I have friends and a therapist that have helped me get through this that I love very much, and I no longer care about how they feel, they made me feel like that for years, and I was stupid enough to try to help them the first few times they vented about their abusive relationship (They never took my advice of course), but now they'll know what I've gone through, and maybe then they'll change so no one has to go through that too.",

    "postText": "I've been in about 5 relationships, and am a 24 year old woman with aspergers. I've tried SO damn hard to fall in love with a real man, but it just doesn't work. I only ever feel truly attracted anime characters. It hasn't been difficult to find decent boyfriends, I'm 'conventionally attractive' and most men don't really care that I'm on the spectrum, but all of them end up making me repulsed at some point. I hate intimacy. I hate being touched, hugged, or kissed. It makes me want to crawl out of my skin. I know it's not really \"love\" that I feel for the characters, but it's the closest thing I've ever felt to love. I feel happy when I think of them. I fall asleep every night daydreaming about scenarios where I would be in relationships with them. I draw and write about them. When I think of my favorite fictional character, I get butterflies, I feel hopeful, excited. When I date real men, I just feel like life doesn't matter, and I'm just some stupid prop for them. Maybe this is because my parents have a bad relationship or something but I truly wish I could feel the love I feel for my favorite characters towards another real human being. I know that if I ever end up in a LTR, I'll have to 'settle' because nobody is as perfect and wonderful and handsome as my fictional crushes. ",

            "comment": "This is actually fairly common. Not always anime characters but nonetheless, fictional (or extremely curated, \"real\" individuals like kpop idols). \n\nIt may have a lot to do with them being very safe in comparison to real men. They can never hurt you or let you down. Real humans are fraught with flaws and they are difficult to trust. If you are scarred by your parents' relationship, it may be worth addressing in therapy. \n\nOr maybe you fall somewhere on the asexual spectrum, considering you say you occasionally feel repulsed and hate intimacy. Idk, just a thought.",

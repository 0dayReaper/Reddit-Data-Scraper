    "postText": "My family is full of abuse, drugs, sexual, physical, and mental. I had a really hard time growing up and my bio dad was the worst. But my mom turned into my abuser for the majority of my life because she did manage to get him away. And it\u2019s a weird thing because my mom did experience sexual assault from a family member at age 4-7. And I know she has issues but still did her best to be better than everyone else. But this also includes her being bipolar, sometimes being the best mom, and then being the mom that kicked me out young. But part of her bad behavior is her always telling my siblings and I shit we should not have heard such as being sexually assaulted as a kid in detail. And because I was diagnosed in middle school I can tell you that\u2019s why I do this. And I hate every second of it. My brain makes me imagine the assault like I\u2019m watching a fucking movie. I do this for any situation in my live. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it, and it\u2019s worse when I see family photos because the images in my head get more vivid. I don\u2019t want to see them or think about it, it keeps me up at night. So yeah there\u2019s a sneak peak of what it\u2019s like to have obsessive compulsive disorder.",

If I want to maintain my good relationship with her it\u2019s something I still have to deal with on my own and a therapist.\nNot to mention, how do I say. \u201cHey mom I can vividly imagine you getting assaulted as a kid\u201d. It\u2019s really not something that\u2019s possible to bring up I promise.",

If you\u2019re doing therapy i\u2019m sure they can advise you or not i\u2019m not sure how it works. Just sucks someone that was meant to be a caregiver has mentally scarred you and isn\u2019t even aware of it. She has bipolar sure so some days are awful and some are wonderful- seems like it\u2019ll never be alright anyway might as well get it out of your head like \u201cdid you ever think about the possible consequences that would have on me as a child- because it seems like it has affected me and I am struggling to find the answer as to what good you thought that was doing\u201d it\u2019s all love but don\u2019t fear another persons reaction when your constant reaction to the situation is right here in the now.",

            "comment": "Are you on medication for it? I have OCD, too, and the SSRI I'm on really helps. It's not like it's gone away 100%, but it's a hundred times better than it was without the medication. There are lots of medications that help with OCD, too, so if one doesn't work out for you, don't get discouraged. Just keep working with your prescriber and trying new meds. You typically need to give them a few weeks to start working (side effects, if present, can also get better over time), but it's worth it. Personally, I don't even get side effects from the medication I'm on.\n\nYou can also see a therapist, of course, and that would be a great idea. You can find therapists who say they help with OCD (they'll usually list it as one of the conditions they help with online). But medication will likely make the process of therapy easier and more effective. If you're being plagued by intrusive thoughts, you should definitely consider medication and therapy.\n\nIf you need financial assistance from your parents, you can just tell them you that you don't want to talk about exactly what they are, but you're having intrusive thoughts that are super gross and disturbing, and they're causing lots of anxiety and distress. There are images you can't get out of your head, and you feel like medication and therapy would really help you, especially considering you've already been diagnosed with OCD. In other words, you have a condition that isn't treated, and you want to start getting treatment for it.\n\nIf you're already on medication and you feel it isn't working, then you can talk to your prescriber and see about trying something else.\n\nOh, and just a little side note. SSRIs and clomipramine are what's most commonly prescribed for OCD. But Wellbutrin is sometimes given off label to treat OCD. When I was on it in the past, it worked well. It certainly has less of a track record than those other meds, though. Also, it's odd because Wellbutrin \"shouldn't\" help with OCD, but some people report that it does nonetheless. I would probably see about trying an SSRI first, though, if I were you, simply because they're more proven. If one SSRI doesn't help or you don't tolerate it well, there are several others that might work. And again, clomipramine is known to help, too. Your prescriber will know all this shit, though.",

    "postText": "Everyone likes to talk shit on Jeff Bazos and Mark Zuckerberg for being shitty CEOs who only care about their stock value, yet Elon Musk and Tesla are somehow different? Everyone who believes this is being fooled by his marketing of himself. He\u2019s not \u201cone of us who made it\u201d he\u2019s another billionaire who doesn\u2019t give a fuck about you or your family.\n\nThis shits really annoying on reddit too, \u201ceLoN mUsK is BeTtInG 100 MillIon To LoWeR cArBon EmmIsons.\u201d, yet he hasn\u2019t given his employees a 401(k) option in three years but now suddenly has 1 billion dollars to invest in bitcoin? \u201cbut eLON mUsK SmOked A JoInt On Joe RoGan!!!\u201d. Cool now tell me why that\u2019s important when Tesla is trying to remove your right to repair on your car. Or what about that time he said a stimulus check is not in the \u201cbest interest\u201d of the people. Like if he ever had to scrape by enough money to barely afford food.\n\nAnother note, when reddit does call out Elon Musk on something shitty he did, they don\u2019t call him out, they call out his company and never him directly.\n\nedit: for people defending Tesla about giving employees stock options instead of a 401(k), please read this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/lfz0io/elon_musk_is_not_a_humble_billionaire_on_our_side/gmpslkr/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3",

To me they seem to gain some pseudo-celebrity status, but that seems to be the problem with the celebrity status in general, it's someone who gets attention for their stature or influence more so than the merit of their actions.\n\nMaybe we should just stop obsessing over them in general and start maybe giving attention to those who deserve it.",

One thing is for sure, socialism is definitely not the solution. That's only going to make it even worse and then it's going to be only power to few people with a 100% guarantee.\n\nIn capitalism it's important for you the people to stand up for yourselfs whenever you can. The problem is how big some companies is becoming so then it becomes natural with only few people with power.\n\nA healthy capitalism is way more strong small and medium businesses and less of these supergiants. Because then it is easier for the people to stand up for themselfs cause they got alot more say and also got more options if they are unhappy. So that will bump up salaries and stuff which is great for the society and the world in the long run as a whole.\n\nBut these giants doesnt want a healthy system, they don't want healthy competition because they would lose out to much. Just look at how they shut down Parler just like that during the election. It's no wonder they wanted Joe Biden to win this election so they can run him as a puppet, everything just makes so much sense.\n\nIt's no wonder they banned alot of people that are conservatives or opposed to the left including me on twitter. It's so logical and it's so clear whats going on. It's laughable even. Laughable but sad, it's a tragedy going on in present time if you ask me.",

It doesnt mean shit if it aint working, then it's just for appearence. \n\nAnd let me tell you Sweden got the highest taxes in the world and we have one of the highest crime rates in Europe and there are so many real big issues with our country right now. \n\nThe politicians are very good at playing on people emotions, to let them know they are safe etc.etc. Sweden is not bad, but it has been alot better though. My point here is that all those things the Nordic countries are good at providing are becoming completly useless once it stops working and I think it's safe to say we are soon there in Sweden.\n\n One thing in is for sure, we are not even close to getting what we are paying for in taxes.\n\nAnyway, if a country is run well and if they are handling the crazy amount of taxmoney they are getting you don't need taxes like us. Sometimes money can be devistating cause it makes most people to comfartable and then something slowly gets worse. And the amount of waste of taxmoney increases substantional if they are getting more taxes not less. It's pretty simple logic.",

Its not like Berkshire companies are co-ops or great places to work. \n\nIt's not like he invests in socially forward companies. His main investments in Apple and Coca Cola sell phones made with abysmal labor rights and a company that sells diabetes in a can. \n\nHe hasn't donated a significant portion of savings to philanthropy, and only has committed to donating once he is dead. Unlike say George Lucas, who donated 50% of his net wealth whilst alive. \n\nEven though he has said he should be paying more in taxes and lives in a small house doesn't mean he is a good guy. \n\nHe is still somebody who probably views making money as a game and doesn't use his power for good, by and large. \n\nHe could pay his employees more. He could have used his influence in government, especially during the Obama administration when he had a willing ear, to actually help pass higher taxes or advocate for higher minimum wage.",

Nice way to hide your wealth, just have to give 1% away a year and you never have to pay taxes, even if the fund grows by 10% and is invested in your family business.",

If you take good care of it and didn't have bad luck (like PCB bending on the iPhone 7) you can keep an iphone for a pretty long time. \n\nWhat i am actually impressed with is how smooth usable and not outdated looking older iphones still are (if they are resetted and nothing is on them). No Android smartphone from the same time feels as good as e.g. an iPhone 6 does. I personally use an Samsung s8 (released 4 years ago) for 3 and a half years and i am still happy, \n\nBUT i would would NOT want to use an S5 or S6, an iPhone 6 (same age ) would be kinda ok if i must, some apps will be incompatible, but all i need to do on the phone would work, i did used one for 2 weeks while i lost my S8.\n\niPhones are a good choice, for people that want to keep their phone  for a long time, i would even say the best choice. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI personally just prefer android because it just has some features that IOS is missing, features of which many are irelevant for 90% of the population...",

Including running afoul of the SEC a few years back to stop a massive short on the Tesla stock. He came within hours of the company failing because of the short attacks, putting his own fortune on the line to keep the company from shitting its pants and being bought out from under him (and then likely bought for its patents and dissolved) The short attack wasn't just to make money, but to lower the value enough for a hostile takeover. The Model 3 almost didn't get made. It being released and being the best car they made saved them in the end. (had they had no product beyond that point Musk would be a former millionaire today, and SpaceX would likely be headed by someone else)\n\nPeople forget how much shit Tesla went through up until 2017. It was nonstop FUD about it failing. People still say Tesla has no viable product and is years away from being a producing an \"actual product\" despite cars rolling around today. That's how effective FUD is. Find the right circles online and you have people who are into EVs who pretend Tesla doesn't exist at all or has zero influence and are excited about every EV announcement from big auto manufacturers with deadlines 7-10 years in the future with no product out, or just a basic compliance car that they barely support or add things to make it unappealing (like kia/hyundai putting ear splitting noises for their pedestrian speaker and making the stock scarce)\n\nThe fact he's willing to put his own ass on the line is something rare in business these days. Where the norm is to get a loan or leverage money that isn't yours just to default on it later.",

The reality couldn\u2019t be further from the truth - he *ratcheted up* just about every single problem left over from the Bush administration (foreign wars, the national security apparatus, regulatory capture, poor public education), had a confusing healthcare plan that everyone still fights about today despite no one really understanding it at all, and essentially sucked up to the big banks and corporate conglomerates with every policy. People just liked him because he was a cool smooth talker with an incredible hype campaign that was so effective they were able to disregard all this completely and shove it under the rug.\n\nUnfortunately, image is everything for most people, and it\u2019s all you\u2019ll ever get from them.

That doesn't say anything about his potential for narcissism or his craving for good publicity and PR, but I think it's important to point out that he has very different reasons for needing a good public image.\n\n2) Obama got elected as a conciliator, not as a problem-solver. In an America with an increasingly Payday bar-fuck-nuts rightist legislature, that means his policies were only ever going to be soft-right policies on a good day rather than genuine reforms.\n\n3) Doing competently what a shambolic administration did incompetently isn't \"ratchet\\[ing\\] up\" that administration's policies. That's no defense of airstrikes in Yemen or dick-measuring with Russia, but I still feel it's important to mention.\n\nI'm still (VERY equivocally) prObama, but there's no world in which I can say I think he did an objectively good job. Fining people for not buying shitty healthcare from shitty private healthcare companies on a shitty marketing website built on government dime hasn't ceased to irritate me, and seriously speaking, implementing that policy was the greatest of his successes.",

There are other ways stock is granted, but this is relatively common in tech and stock is usually not gifted at no cost to an employee.\n\nI could easily see low wage Tesla workers struggling to get the most out of this and a 401k would likely be preferred for some.\n\nEDIT: A now deleted comment mentioned RSU's and what I am describing is an ISO. RSU's do not operate this way with taxes and so they would not work this way for low wage workers, but if people would like to they can read through reviews from Glassdoor for specific experiences with Tesla though it really doesn't seem like their lower wage workers are really getting great compensation plans working there\n\nhttps://www.glassdoor.com/Benefits/Tesla-Stock-Options-US-BNFT19_E43129_N1_IP2.htm",

I know I shouldn\u2019t be resentful because I did meet him on grindr and it kind of goes with the territory. At first it was just conversation that lead to him asking to come over and watch a movie. I said sure come over so for him it was going to be a 35 minute drive to my place. He said he was on his way and I waited and 40 minutes goes by. I went to message him on snap and he blocked me. So I went to grindr and saw that he went offline next to a muscle power bottom. Normally I really wouldn\u2019t care but we conversed for hours as in actual conversation not filled with pic 4 pic wham bam thank you mam innuendo. I let my guard down and now I feel horrible. I didn\u2019t get angry or lash out on the app at him I have. Well atleast I think I do lol. I did though write him a polite message \u201cIt was a pleasure chatting and getting to know you Jerry, if you ever want to chat your welcome to message me anytime and for future reference may you please be honest that \u201cif\u201d you make other plans with someone else, just out of respect let me know please, thank you\u201d\n\n I have always been one of those gay guys that\u2019s always a bridesmaid and never the bride. \n\nThe situation this morning brought up old emotions that I will never be good enough. \n\nAll I have is my brain and youthful skin that\u2019s pretty much it lol. \n\nThank you for reading have a blessed day",

            "comment": "If he asked you for an invitation,  then ghosted you, it isn't about you. It's about him. He might have enjoyed the conversation vs boredom, but ultimately he was only looking for a quick hook-up. When he found one, he left you in a way that would cut off future attempts for something more.\n\nCount yourself lucky that you saw this behaviour now before you were more deeply invested. People on the other end can tell if you are lonely and looking for substance or just DTF. \n\nYour message to him was very passive-aggressive, and I don't think that response will ultimately do you any favours. If he is going to treat you so carelessly after hours of conversing, he is unlikely to suddenly start caring after reading your missive. Also, you have now left another invitation for him to reach out after he led you on then ghosted you. He treated you poorly,  for no good reason, and you are thanking him for the attention he did give regardless. \n\nThis could be why you are always the bridesmaid. The saying \"Confidence is key\" is not just about projecting stability, but also rejecting behaviour that falls below your standards. It can be hard when you are lonely and vulnerable, but try to focus less on \"Why did I let my guard down?\" and more on \"What a toerag. Glad I won't be wasting anymore time on him.\"\n\nYou are worth more than a chatty toerag. If he ever messages you again,  you should tell him so.",

Because the conversation on his end was very personal and he was depicting himself negatively after a recent break up and his behavior afterwards. And he stated he wanted to make a change. That is my only motivation to keep the line of communication open. I want to help him heal if that makes sense. Strictly on a platonic basis and nothing more.",

You should not have to sacrifice being treated with respect just to help another person with their troubles. You sound like a natural caregiver, and that is lovely,  but caregivers often do not know when to set boundaries. A lack of boundaries leads to getting used.\n\nI hope you will find your boundaries and stick to them. Would you treat a friend like that? Particularly a friend that was willing to listen when you shared something so personal?\n\nShowing vulnerability does not excuse toerag behaviour. As a friend or lover,  you deserve to be treated with respect.",

You remind me of my best friend,  who has accepted careless treatment far too often in our 27 years of friendship.\n\nForgive me if my tone is strong. It is in your nature your take care of others.  It is in my nature to take care of people like you. :)\n\nGood luck darling.",

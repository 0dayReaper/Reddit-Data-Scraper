    "postText": "I live in a city with free trams. I was coming from the grocery with a trolley full of food for my family, as I was going away on a business trip for a week. On my stop, an obnoxious couple were standing in the way, the guy even had his foot out. The tram was clear / not crowded, so I didn\u2019t understand why he had to stand blocking the door with his feet so far apart.\n\nI told him to get out of my way as the doors were opening. I moved my trolley (there was about a foot drop between the tram floor and the ground outside). The back wheel of my trolley got caught on something - yes the guy was the culprit - and my trolley fell off on the ground. A girl and her companion on the ground below were hit and I apologized to them profusely as they helped me get my trolley back up, asking if I was ok. I looked back to the guy blocking the door that tripped my trolley having a f-cking good laugh at my expense with his equally despicable companion.\n\nI am still seething hours later, I could still clearly remember the guy\u2019s face. I have not avenged myself lol and it felt like a f\u2014 you from the universe with how things unfolded. Gosh, I\u2019m still so angry \ud83e\udee0",

    "postText": "I asked for divorce few months ago because he emotionally destroyed me. We still have to meet in a few weeks to totally end the relationship. I don\u2019t want any contact with him so I blocked him on everything even if he did not try to really reach out for me but whatever. He has videos of us fucking, my face is clearly visible and also nudes. I don\u2019t know if I should break the no contact to tell him to delete it or if it will just give him an excuse to manipulate and hurt me again. I don\u2019t think he will release these videos (I mean at least I hope) but I don\u2019t want him to have them anyway\u2026 what should I do ? I really don\u2019t feel like talking to him",

I know it sucks, but personally I wouldn\u2019t bring it up to him. Like you said, it probably would just make him more likely to be manipulative about it. Hugs.",

Yes we've heard this one say she gave permission in an awkward face time a group of us walked in on.  \n\nThat being said every time he has a break up the first thing he does is delete any nudes of them.   Even the ones that are ok if he shows people.   He would never show a girl that sent him something private.   \n\nHe's the biggest asshole in our group but I've always respected him for that.   \n\nAlso to note I've never seen a nude of any girl he's with.   My wife is against porn and such.  Asshole friend also respects that.",

I dont know the kind of relationship you have with each other and I dont know what kind of man he is. But the truth is... just because you ask him to delete the pictures, he doesnt have to do it. There is no way you can make sure they are gone except for when you steal all his devices and even then things might be saved in the cloud or smth. You can ask him to delete everything, ofc and hope he respects your wishes.

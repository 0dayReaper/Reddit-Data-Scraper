One \"alphaman\" I remember having to pick him up off the ground cause he was crying like a baby, another had deep-seated trust issues about women but was also emotionally cheating on his spouse, and another had been raped by a parent as a child, he doesn't get the alpha shit either.\n\nBe a good person people. Try to do the best for those you love. Self respect will earn you more points in this world. Excercise, eat right, study, do them because they are good for you not because of some desire to impress. Love, Respect, Understanding. Be a real person people!!",

I primarily hear about alpha males from groups like incels or MGTOW etc. \n\nOfc I hear women say stuff about \"real men\", sometimes in a toxic way (\"real men treat their woman like a qween\") and sometimes in a slightly less toxic, more supportive way (\"real men cry\"). \n\nAnd I see memes that women share about alpha men, but I don't think I've ever heard another woman sincerely use that word as a desirable trait in a man irl. \n\nIt's intriguing that we have such different experiences!",

Like I'm a horny mother fucker with a high libido and i'm into some *kinky* shit, but I also haven slept with anyone in over a year because I'm a 25 year old making minimum wage and living with his parents who forbid me from inviting girls over. Who would want to date that? \n\nWhat girl is going to date a guy who doesn't have a house/apartment to themselves and doesn't have much independence? I've essentially just given up on even trying, its not like \"Hey baby, want to come over after my mom goes to bed and try to be quiet so we dont wake them up and I dont get yelled at\" is a pickup line that's going to get me anywhere. \n\nId love to be more sexually active but since I cant afford rent and I cant get a job that allows me to afford rent im just stuck, and the idea of dating someone is a pipe dream at this point. No one wants to date a guy who doesn't have their own place. \n\nSo the reality is that gen Z *is* more sexually open and willing to have sex, but most of us don't have the financial independence or ability to pursue a relationship or sexual activity due to the current wealth inequality issues in our society. Thats why birth rates and sexual activity is down among this generation, not because they arent willing.",

We can give them that respect and common decency without normalising it as a career path that every person suddenly thinks they should put themselves out there for the extra money. It's not a normal career so if someone doesn't want to date someone in sex work it should be accepted.    \n\nThose that genuinely want to do sex work, all the more power to them, but many people do it when they are in the wrong frame of mind, don't genuinely want to do it and are just in it for the money or are so strapped for cash they have no choice but to try it.    Instead of normalising people selling pictures and videos of themselves it should be accepted and have resources available to make sure their mental health is good and that they genuinely want to do sex work, and what should be normalised is paying people a living wage for a hard days' work no matter the job so that those in those jobs because they are so strapped for cash don't feel pushed to do sex work. If the job takes a full work day to do, it should pay a living wage.    \n\nAlso something else that I've noticed anecdotally, pier pressure seems to be pushing some people to do it to, that needs to stop. Its a big decision and the decision should be made by the person if they are considering doing it for genuine reasons. No encouraging, no discouraging, only give an opinion if they ask for it but remind them its up to them and that it is a big decision. Many places don't hire if they find out about a persons' sex career and so it limits future prospects (it shouldn't happen except in exceptional circumstances as long as its not flaunted/advertised at work but thats the reality). If they are not in the mental state to make that decision, just tell them to take the time to look after themselves before making the decision, and if its something they always wanted to do and they're going ahead with it, be there to support them and congratulate their successes.",

As a woman, you get exactly the same treatment if you say you're not OK with your husband/boyfriend going to strip clubs.  \"But it's normal, everyone does it!  Stop being so insecure!\"  But why are THEY so insecure about the fact that some people want a completely monigamous relationship?  There is a huge element of shaming and bullying now towards people who don't want to live some kind of sexual free-for-all.  Just the other day on reddit someone was losing their mind and in an absolute rage because of people having their own preferences and actually said that if you refuse to date someone because they're a sex worker, trans or for any other reason then you are dehumanising them.  But what about dehumanising someone by pressuring and bullying them into having sex and relationships with people they don't want to have sex and relationships with?\n\nIt's especially sick and twisted in this era when we're all so informed about consent, and No menas No, and you mustn't sexually harrass people......UNLESS you find their sexual preference politically incorrect, in which case bully and shame them to the ends of the earth until they cave in and sleep with you!",

It can be difficult to compromise something that makes up a large part of what makes you feel wanted, special, and/or loved.\n\nHaving dated a couple of strippers (exotic dancers, if you prefer,) in my 20's, I can tell you that neither lasted more than a month or so, almost exclusively because I wasn't comfortable with all that glitter on my clothes. (Okay, also with my friends seeing them naked all the time. I admit it.) I never regretted either breakup, I hope the same for you.\n\nYou gotta be true to you; you'll never find real happiness if you compromise your feelings or values.",

I ignored that and just pretended I didn\u2019t see it.\n\nTo be honest, at the time, I thought it was some YouTube thing. But I got worried that she was cheating, and eventually sat down with her and had a chat. I asked her about the phone, the stuff in her closet, and the fact that she seemed to always have money when she only works 10 hours a week.  \n\nWe went back and forth over an hour until she admitted that she has an active onlyfans, has \u201csugar daddies\u201d, and does some webcam shows occasionally.  \n\nAnd no, I didn\u2019t stumble upon it on onlyfans.

Accusing you of being insecure is a really shitty thing to do. Its almost like someone calling you controlling because you don\u2019t allow them to cheat on you\n\nI personally wouldnt have an issue with this but its 1000% ok for you to have your own dealbreakers because ultimately this is your life and you have to do what makes you happy",

Its realistically a matter of boundaries which were crossed and now you have a good reason to leave. I hope things improve for you dude  good luck.",

    "postText": "I have never been comfortable or enthusiastic with the idea of marriage. I don't like the social pressure to get married.  I don't respect the tradition of marriage. I don't like large public declarations of love. I don't want a wedding. I don't want to wear a ring. I don't want to or feel the need to get the government in on my relationship. I have seen many miserable marriages. I have seen messy divorce. I don't understand why everyone looks at me like I'm an asshole when I say I don't want to marry. I don't understand why marriage is seen as an opt-out for relationships. I just want to be able to coexist without all of this social pressure. \n\nMy girlfriend of 5 years feels very differently. We have always been great together. She has always wanted a wedding and a husband. This is pretty much the only big thing we disagree on. She says things like \"so you never want to be able to call me your wife?\" No! I don't! I don't care! I don't understand why that is so important! Why do you need a piece of paper from the government to feel like your relationship is complete? \"I don't think I should have to have a reason to get married.\" Why do I have to have a reason to not want to marry, then? Why is marriage a default?\n\nWe are compatible in every way except for this one. Every time I think about marrying, I feel like I am making a mistake. I am deeply uncomfortable with it. We have had rocky times in our relationship and have come out stronger after them. I just think it is astoundingly stupid that of all things, THIS might be the thing that breaks us up.",

That\u2019s not just a small issue- it\u2019s a HUGE one and you\u2019re essentially stringing her along by staying with her since she\u2019s never going to get that aspect of her life she wants.\n\nIn a separate point of view- there are many things that come with marriage that will make your relationship more secure, beyond the superficial ring and wife/husband changes. My husband was someone who thought he would never ever want to get married- we settled on a 10min drive through ceremony. \n\nIt makes a lot of technical issues go away- if he ever ends up in the hospital or vice versa I won\u2019t have any issue seeing him. If we ever have kids it will set the groundwork for child support if things don\u2019t work out, financial things are also much easier while married. Just to give an outside perspective.",

They want different things in life, and that's OK. Instead of calling it \"stupid\" that it's a dealbreaker for her, he should let her go. If it's a \"stupid\" thing to break up over, why isn't he the one to give up what he wants? Because it is NOT stupid. It's a fundamental incompatibility. \n\nHe shouldn't feel pressured to marry but him wanting her to accept that and stick around isn't fair either. \"I know you want to get married but instead just stick around and give me my way and never get what you want, otherwise it's 'stupid'\" is essentially what he's saying. \n\nThey're not a good match. They want different things out of life. That's OK.\n\nAnd honestly, I wouldn't want someone to cave and marry me because they didn't want me to leave. That's a terrible reason to get married. It should be an enthusiastic yes or a hell no. But he needs to accept that he can't give her what she wants in life and let her go. And hopefully she's not sticking around clinging to the false hope that he'll change his mind, because that's not fair to him either.",

Because only your opinion matters and your gf should just go along with it? \n\nWay to invalidate her. Her feelings on the matter are just as valid as yours. It's a good thing you're breaking up since you don't respect that.\n\nYou are fundamentally incompatible. She wants one thing, you want the opposite. Nobody's \"wrong\" for wanting what they want. Don't treat her like she is. \n\nAs long as you respect her feelings, nobody's the bad guy in this break up. But when you start saying it's \"stupid,\" (essentially, that what she wants is \"stupid\") you become the asshole.\n\nLet her go but be respectful about it. \n\nThere are lots of valid reasons to marry and she doesn't need to justify that to you.",

I think it's fine that you don't want to get married but it's unfair to be with someone that expects it. You should have been upfront with anyone you date from the beginning that it's not something you want. \n\nYour relationship is definitely at a breaking point, what you think isn't a big deal is probably a deal breaker for her. It also shows her, you aren't really committed to the relationship.",

I would marry him in an instant if he wanted to get married. But he doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s okay\u2026 I choose him over marriage. \n\nMy point is, it\u2019s a pretty black and white issue. It\u2019s a dealbreaker or it\u2019s not. Your choices are: (1) you compromise and get married eventually, (2) she compromises and you don\u2019t, or (3) you mutually decide to get married or not get married and you move forward accordingly. \n\nThe security of marriage is nice but at the end of the day, it\u2019s like you said. It\u2019s a stupid piece of paper. Not the end of the world either way. Breakups suck if you\u2019re married or not. \n\nJust my two cents.",

OP shouldn't get married if he doesn't want to (and she shouldn't try to pressure him into doing it), but his gf shouldn't be hanging on to false hope that he'll change his mind. But she also shouldn't give that up forever if that's what she wants out of life. It's kind of like kids. Nobody should ever \"compromise\" on that. Instead, find somebody who shares your goals.",

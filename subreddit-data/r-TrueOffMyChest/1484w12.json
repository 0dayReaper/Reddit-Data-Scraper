    "postText": "This is a very long story with a lot of relevant backstory, so please bear with me.\n\nI(19F) was outed by the priest's daughter (18F) at my church, and I'm still not over it.\n\nIt has been a year since my parents found out and 2 years since the rest of the church found out. I know I should be over it, at least a little bit, but I feel constantly anxious and angry about the whole situation.\n\nBefore I get into a deep dive of what happened, here's the backstory:\n\nThe Priest's daughter at my church, we'll call her L, and I became best friends when I was around 6 or 7. We were inseparable and found any way possible to see each other. We got to hang out every Sunday at church, but we were like sisters so that obviously wasn't enough for us. This whole situation hurts even more thinking of all the fond and happy memories we had. Of course, as most friendships, it became rocky. I admit, I wasn't the best friend in the world to have. I often had severe mood swings as a child and it affected my friendship with L a lot, as well as the other relationships around me. I was deemed as the \"weird kid\" pretty often because of the culture I was raised in (my mother is an immigrant) as well as the religion I was brought up in. With this, things became worse when a bully (we'll call him X) started coming to our church.\n\nX was very close friends with L's older brother, and soon after became friends with L. X, however, didn't like me all that much. I remember when he'd make fun of me for eating, saying things about how overweight I was (which was completely untrue, I was severely underweight for my age), and telling me to take my \"mental pills\". My self esteem was crushed week after week, and it seemed the longer this kept going on, the more I noticed L taking his side rather than defending me. However, because I was a pushover, I didn't say much about it and continued being close to her. When X finally moved away after a few years of torment, I felt extreme euphoria. I was so unbelievably happy. But this is where the problems had started.\n\nOne day, about a year after X had left, I came to church a bit late and saw L by the doorway with another girl as they whispered to each other. When they saw me approaching them, they quickly ditched their conversation. However, I noticed that something seemed off and asked what was going on. The other girl kept her mouth shut while L told me nothing was happening. I was sceptical, but didn't press much further and waited for Communion. But first, I needed to go to confession. As I stood in the line, I saw X emerge from the altar. I remember how scared I was. I was frozen in place as he made a passing glance at me. After I had a very nervous confession, I ran downstairs and cried.\n\nL's mother saw me and tried comforting me, asking what was wrong and the other usual questions and remarks when comforting a child that could barely breathe between sobs. That's when I told her that L had lied to me and that X was back. She brought L down and she explained to me that she didn't tell me because she knew I would \"act this way\". L didn't even apologize. I told her I wasn't forgiving her for lying to me, and to leave me alone. This event marked a long period in which L would constantly ignore me, attempt to single me out of every conversation and event, and borderline bully me.\n\nAfter my mom and the priest found out about the feud, they decided to sit down and talk about it. This, unfortunately, led to a screaming match between them. While my mother tried addressing what was going on between me and L, the priest started blaming me for being tainted (being taught in a public school while his daughter was home schooled) and for introducing the idea of \"crushes\". I was, apparently, sinful for making his daughter jealous of the pretty dresses I wore and the friends I got to have outside of the church. At this point, our families were at an impasse. The next Sunday, the priest took me into his office and asked if L and I could rebuild our relationship. I remember being hesitant, but eventually saying that I'd make an effort. \n\nI was now in high school and making progress in my friendship with L. Although it was a bit awkward at times, it seemed like we were making progress. Then COVID happened, and we were confined to our devices for interaction. At this point in time, I was in the closet about being bisexual. However, after texting L and getting deep with our emotions, L confessed to me that she had been having \"gay thoughts\". In an effort to comfort her, I said that I knew what she was going through, that I was bisexual, and that I was there for her with whatever I needed. We then both decided to delete the messages to make sure our parents wouldn't see them. When COVID restrictions were lessened in 2021, L and her family came over to bless our house. When we were alone, I confided in her that I defined myself as pansexual instead of bisexual, to which she nodded and told me she was glad I told her. This happened around February or March.\n\nThen, one Sunday during the Summer of 2021 while my mother was out of the country, the priest asked me to go into his office. He laid everything out about how L had told him I was bisexual. I cried a lot. I had a minor panic attack. I begged and pleaded for him not to tell anyone, especially my parents, but he said \"people will learn, OP\". I didn't know what to make of this as I was in fight or flight mode, so I didn't question most of what he said to me that meeting too much. I just remember him humiliating me and calling me a sinner. At the end, we treated the meeting like a confession and did the closing prayer.\n\nFast forward to March of 2022. I was about to graduate from high school and I was extremely anxious about various different things that were going on in my life. It was Good Friday and I was at an evening service when suddenly I had one of the worst panic attacks of my life. I could barely breathe, think, talk, or control my body. I remember how my hands and mouth were going numb. My dad took me into the car to while my mom stayed behind. She was inside for a very long time, even after most of the other people had left. By that point, I had fallen asleep (or maybe passed out???) in the car. When I woke up, we were at a gas station near our home and my mom asked me if I had ever talked to L about being gay.\n\nWe had a very long conversation that night, and I had found out that soon after the service ended, my mom and the priest got into a heated argument about why I had such an awful panic attack. With this, L joined in and yelled at my mother about how I was bisexual and was a sinner.\n\nIn the following days, we learned many things.\n1) The whole church knew before my parents knew.\n2) L had screenshoted my messages, so she had them as proof.\n3) I was discussed as if I were a predator.\n4) Both the priest and L talked the all of the families about it.\n5) They started telling people at the funeral of a very notable church member in the summer of 2021.\n\nI was shocked and heartbroken. I felt truly betrayed, and my family and I decided to leave the church and go elsewhere.\n\nSince the events that took place in 2022, I am no longer religious (though not entirely because of this reason), but I still go to church with my family to support them. I know they adore their religion, and I still find beauty in it, so I don't really mind. I am currently going to college and I have an amazing partner who I absolutely adore with all of my heart. In many areas, I'm thriving. But in some, I still find myself very resentful.\n\nI still see L from time to time, whether it's at school or at work. At first it really bothered me, but I've come to accept that she'll just have to deal with me and vice versa. We live on the same planet, so what's the point in bothering so much?\n\nI was starting to get over this event until recently. I have contact with some friends at my old church, and one of them confided in me saying that L was telling everyone I had \"started it\". She said that I was the one to blame for all that had happened because I had apparently pushed her to do what she did. Up until recently, I really tried to forgive L. I genuinely thought about reaching out and telling her this. But now there's no way I could ever lower my self worth in order to give her an ounce of pity. She's using this whole situation to put me down and lift herself up.\n\nSo, dear readers, thank you for bearing with me, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to write out my feelings and version of events. I've kept my mouth shut after all these years, and defending myself feels almost liberating in a way. Thank you.\n\nTLDR: After a long, heated history with my ex best friend (the priest's daughter), she outed me as bisexual behind my back to my whole church.",

If she made that up, she lied to you and that's *also* a sin. Furthermore, what you talked about with the priest was behind closed doors. So whatever was discussed, was confidential. Therefore, can't he get sacked because of the things he and his daughter told the congregation?",

The kind that would be friendly to ya then spread rumors, secrets and lies about ya behind your back. \n\nAlso had a similar \"unawakening\" with Christianity. Was in this church as a child since 2009 then left after 4 years. Many of the church goers loved to gossip and my oldest sis who gave birth out of wedlock was a popular topic. They loved to make snide and passive aggressive comments, one of them even made a condescending insult disguised as \"friendly advice\" to the second oldest to \"keep her legs closed.\"\n\nDuring an annual church retreat, my mom went to the pastor to have him speak with the church about the gossip and bullying, but he called her \"a witch trying to destroy his church!\"\n\nI was already having my doubts with Christianity but this utterly destroyed my faith in it, its even worse since his family also partook in the drama -- especially that wife of his...\n\nI know not why people are like this but at least you're in a much happier and healthier place, eh? In future, all she'll be to ya is just a bad, insignificant, memory while you're livin your best life buildin bridges instead of burnin them like she is. Wish ya well on your future endeavors, OP \ud83d\ude09",

Probablly not. But it is 100% what she deserves, even if it seems drastical. All I can see after this story is a bullied person who was forced to re-befriend a bully of hers only to her to get publically shamed. No one would blame you, not even your parents.\n\nMake sure no one sees it, so when she tries to say you beat her up, you and your friends say otherwise.\n\nWhatever you do, please, have this option in mind.

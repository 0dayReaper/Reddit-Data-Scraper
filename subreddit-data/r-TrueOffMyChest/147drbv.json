    "postText": "I'm just exhausted with my current relationship and how many times I can hint at him that I miss him and want to see him and he'll say the same. Yet when he's off from work, he'd rather focus on playing a video game or in a chatroom watching a video (probably on voice chat) with an online friend. Seeing that he's 'playing on a game in discord' which is actually just a program similar to Rabbit streaming just makes my heart drop. It's aggravating because the relationship seems 'healthy'. But is it really? Because I feel like I'm just being lovebombed at this point to hide the fact that he barely wants to put any effort in me. It wasn't always like this, but as it nears two years it's just getting worse. It's hard because I do love him and it's much healthier than my last relationship but this is such a problem it's giving me a headache. It's either be 'mean' (more aggressive confronting) or break up. I feel almost scared to do the latter because he's told me he had a dream about me breaking up with him and how he begged for me to take him back. But I am planning on moving away from my current state and further up north so if that does happen, I'll be safe.  \n\n\nAnd the last relationship. Basically it was with someone 10 years older than me when I was 21/22. My trust in them overall shattered since the beginning because they said straight to my face that they 'remembered information about everyone else but me', they'd literally flirt with EVERYONE who posted their selfies online and go 'I'm just complimenting them' even though it was calling them 'hot' 'sexy' 'etc'. I did know about their polyamory, as they had a few fwbs they told me about when we were dating. However while I first viewed them positively, I started to not  trust them at all. Even more so that I realized these relationships actually involved flirting (despite them.. breaking up). Basically I'd get upset really easy because of all of this, and then my ex began to call me a 'control freak' for this and said 'I didn't like any of their friends' even though I literally had a problem with the two fwbs. One seemed to be mean to everyone she met and the other gave obvious incel vibes and was overall super creepy.\n\nEven though I've only been in 2 romantic relationships I just feel so done. I've always felt more myself single. But I'm at the point in time where I'm going to want kids really soon and I would feel bad being a single parent and having to explain to the kid(s) I'm their only parent. And what if I'm so busy that it'd make raising the kid tricky? It just seems so tricky to raise a kid on your own... But I also don't know what to do when it comes to (romantic) relationships and if I have to be with someone who doesn't treat me well while I raise them, it's not going to go over well.",

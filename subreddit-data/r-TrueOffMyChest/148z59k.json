            "comment": "And you would be absolutely correct. CNA work is tough, but I was underpaid, overworked, and the \"benefits\" they bragged about I would have had to pay 100% for if I opted into them. But the thing is, I was paid $11.75, income tax is already too high in Montana, so my take home pay was already barely enough to cover my bills, then if I paid for my \"benefits\", I wouldn't be able to make rent, let alone anything else. So even though $11.75 is too high a wage to qualify for Medicaid, I chose not to report my wages so I can remain covered while still being able to pay at least my rent. I went to the food bank every week because I couldn't afford food, and when I got my check, I bought some food, gas, and things like toilet paper knowing that my bank account would go into overdraft when I submitted my rent check. I could easily, and happily do all of the tough work they required if they paid a living wage and if management valued us at all, but they don't, and that is why I am no longer a CNA.\n\nAmong a lot of other reasons, but working really hard to narrowly escape homelessness just isn't worth it imo.",

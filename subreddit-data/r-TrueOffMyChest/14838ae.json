If you say it in a sincere, vulnerable but also playful and lighthearted way, it might be best. I don\u2019t know about your friend\u2019s personality, but in general, people react better to this type of energy when someone is \u201cconfessing\u201d a crush. \nSay what you feel! And before you do it, make a pact with yourself that no matter what happens, you won\u2019t regret it \u2764\ufe0f Good luck!",

But you\u2019ll never know what can happen unless you say it. And you should know that this is something anyone would feel extremely flattering about. If he never saw you as a potential girlfriend before, he might do so after you confess. It\u2019s inevitable, he\u2019ll at least think of that! But I don\u2019t want to get ahead of things. Just have fun telling him, and it will go well regardless.",

Now I don\u2019t even have a second thought about it, rejections happen but in the grand scale of things it\u2019s not important. I didn\u2019t mold me to be the way I am today, it was just one of those trivial experiences I had. \n\nIn life you\u2019ll be rejected 10000 times, but it takes one acceptance to potential change your life. He might reject you, it might feel awful but the pain won\u2019t last forever. Or he might not reject you, maybe you\u2019ll start dating and it\u2019s the start of something beautiful. Who knows? It\u2019s your decision and your feelings \u2764\ufe0f",

    "postText": "TW: SA and DV \nIm writing this here because i have no where else it\u2019s safe to talk about it except anonymously online. Anyways. \n  A close (f) friend of mine was married at the 13 to a 20 year old man. And for the past 10 years has suffer physical and sexual assault from him and been forced to have one kid. this all happened before I knew her.  Recently she became pregnant with a second child after being raped again by him, and has confided in me all this information. I have been encouraging her to get a divorce and despite the risks to her safety, and the familial backlash and culture of shame, she has done it and I\u2019m so freaking proud. She will be going to court soon for the divorce after a month of fighting with her family about this. I\u2019m so angry that someone would do this to such an amazing person as her, but so unbelievably proud of her that she is standing up for herself and her kids even while pregnant!  She\u2019s an absolute super hero and I just pray that God will finally give her a break. I don\u2019t know why life ends up like this but she has shown me that no matter how bad things are, you can always find happiness and good things. \nAlso for the religious people there any prayers for her would be nice.  If you\u2019re not religious then thank you for reading :) thoughts are nice too.",

    "postText": "I recently graduated from university and want to travel with two of my best friends (my age) before we go on with our lives. One of my best friends suffers from depression (we'll name him John for now; the other person we'll call Peter), and I've been dealing with his issues during university for many years. When I initially meet him, there is little indication of his despair, but as Peter and I learn more about his life, we begin to notice everything.  \r  \nFor example, if his mother phones him every morning or whenever she is available to talk. he would be quite frustrated, especially when his mother comes to visit. \r  \n\r  \nNot to mention, Join had never gotten to hang out or attend any parties before his university years. John's life is completely under his mother's supervision. Peter and I tried to talk a lot about his anxiety and issues, and John was worried that his behaviors could be terrifying in one day; Peter even urged him to see a psychologist at times. However, his mental state deteriorates following an argument with his mother; John became more anger issues, and he starts to damage anything around him. He becomes much more upset when he thinks about his mother. After a year or so, he's been going to the hospital a lot more and taking medication. We let him live his life at the time; he wanted to find his comfort zone since Peter and I partied out, drank, and socialized a lot, but not John. Since John isn't sure how to engage with others. After a while, I see that his condition improves year after year, so I invite him to join us on our vacation. However, his condition drops during the trip when we encounter difficulties on one of the days. \n\nNow he is uncontrollable and can damage anything he sees, even his phone\r  \nWe're at a loss for what to do after a few days, and he blames us for breaking his phone. The phone needed to be repaired for around $267. I and Peter say we'll pay for the phone; he says he doesn't want to do anything with us anymore and that we don't have to. then he began to walk away.\r  \n\r  \nAfter a while, his mother texted me and asked for the cost of the repairs, which came to $267. I wanted to pay, but I didn't have much money left after the trip and other expenses.\r  \n\r  \nHow should I proceed?",

You need to cut all ties and communication with all of them.",

The old people that suck are hard on your generation because they forget the shit show they went through. \n\nIgnore his mother completely.   She is nothing to you.   She forgot her dark times or never truly got over them.   That's why she sheltered your friend. \n\nYour friend.  Back off and leave him alone.   He asked you too.   He also has to work through this himself if he ever wants to be happy. \n\nI think everyone has burned at least one good friend in their life.  A friend that didn't deserve to be burned.  All because that person was working through shit they weren't equipped to handle at the time.   Good friend did nothing wrong. \n\nWe feel bad about that latter when we fix ourselves.   A little guilt in life is a good thing.   It shows you grew.",

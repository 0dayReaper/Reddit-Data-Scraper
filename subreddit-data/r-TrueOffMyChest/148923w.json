    "postText": "My(21F)recent friend B(19M) is very expressive and creative. He has just recently started to talk about personalities switching. He operated the terms such as host, and alters, and fictives\u2026 Little did he know I got diagnosed with actual DID and it was hell! It\u2019s not some fun personalities playing roles. I could \u201cwake up\u201d in the middle of the street at some point. Switching was rare and dissociation was frequent. It\u2019s traumatic and inconvenient and you NEVER use your condition to get out of accountability. Needless to say\u2026 I did a lot of research and I know he lies. I am sick of people validating his delusions. Because of people like that I can\u2019t confess to my friends about my DID.",

                    "comment": "I do still doubt my theory Because of that; but my friend dropped such amazing lines that make him the case worth University research if it is true. Like he did not switch and dissociate at all up until last week and I knew him for 6 month. Also he said a couple of times that his alter is \u201ctaking\u201d a shower, which is not near any known alter perception. His Alters can switch on command which is insane level of control if he started experiencing DID recently. Everything bad he ever says or does comes from the alters and is excused by the fact that \u201cit is not him\u201d. Also you\u2019re supposed to have at some form of memory loss when switching as a base symptom right? Oh well all the alters for some reason knew exactly who I was and info I only told B. But some of them did not know what\u2019s fork? Suspicious.",

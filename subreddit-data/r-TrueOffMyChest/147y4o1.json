    "postText": "This is a long running issue of which I have about 100 examples over the years but in a nutshell my family has always ignored me, don't Include me in things, don't keep me in the loop of new things and then tell me that it's my fault for not making an effort. \n\nI am introverted and enjoy my own company and aren't as talkative as the others but I do make an effort, ask questions, try to get involved and this is always met with one word answers or an awkward answer and then they tend to leave the area wherever I am and go and talk somewhere else, like I'm a high school movie when the nerd tries to talk to the cool kids.\n\nSo recently my younger brother who is 16 is going to his prom and it was also his birthday about the same time. Not only was I not aware he was going to his prom as my family didn't tell me but I then found out that my older brother and his father decided to take him out to buy a suit for it and have a fun day out with him and not only was I not invited, I wasn't even told about it. \n\nWhen I went to see my family, which I do every week or so as I live about an hour away, I saw the suit and questioned it and they initially tried to dismiss it and after some prodding I got the answer out of them and was kind of annoyed. My thing is fashion and suits, it's one of my biggest interests, I have several and they all know this about me and didn't include me\n\nI mentioned this and they said they assumed I wouldn't want to go because I'm introverted, I said how I felt, got a little mad and went to sit on my own to calm down. No one came to speak to me so I went back into the house to talk it out and everyone got mad at me for making things awkward and now no one is talking to me as I'm making everything about me and I've made everyone Including my younger brother feel bad.\n\nSo I decided to group message them, telling them I'm done won't be speaking or seeing them again and it's been 2 weeks, haven't heard anything and I'm 1000 times happier",

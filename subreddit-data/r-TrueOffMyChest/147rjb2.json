    "postText": "i don\u2019t need relationship advice because i know this person is not right for me. i struggle with low self worth, and i\u2019m afraid to lose the few breadcrumbs of love i get from them because it feels like that\u2019s all i\u2019ll ever get. there\u2019s a side to them that makes me feel loved &amp; safe, but they can never maintain it for long. there\u2019s a switch that goes off, seemingly at random but i suspect it is when they feel they\u2019ve shown too much vulnerability. it\u2019s so confusing to hear nice words from them but feel no love or effort. i want to be understanding of their avoidant nature, but it\u2019s putting me in a bad place mentally. my happiness is too dependent on them, so i am just going to have to leave. i said that i wouldn\u2019t leave this time, but this can\u2019t be my future.",

            "comment": "I feel some context is needed, because I would hate to call someone abusive if the reality is something else.\n\nHowever, if you do not feel safe, things to do to make sure you are correct. Find happy place, calm your emotions. Then think WHY do you not feel safe. What is happening to cause that feeling? Is it red flags or fear of rejection, feeling of inadequatacy, etc. Once you sort out why, then make your plan. If it is abusive, cut it off and run. New friends can always be found. Both in person and over the internet. My internet gaming buddies saved me LOADS of times. \n\nLow confidence- Find hobbies and focus on you. Find things that make you happy. Games, hiking, gym, writing, kink clubs, knitting, tea and books, whatever. Do it! And work on you. Your self development is more important than anything. Can't topple a castle with a solid foundation, as some would say.",

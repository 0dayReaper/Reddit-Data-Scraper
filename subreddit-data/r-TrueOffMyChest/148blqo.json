    "postText": "Just got out of jail from assualt from a 1.5 yr relationship and I havn't done any drugs at all but recently was starting to cheat on her but couldn't bring myself to tell ex about it because friend of mine is struggling as well and wants me to be with said friend and now I'm regreting my bad decisions to my ex and I feel like the most worst bf living and I hate my self and I feel terrible for my ex and ex's family and I don't want any you shouldn't have done that or should have tried something else because it was going through my mind in the cell I was in and I feel like i wanna end myself for it but I'm not going to and I'm thinking about hurting myself for my actions but I'm scared that I might kill myself and Im regretting my actions and I really really feel bad for my ex so much that I want to give something to show how sorry I feel but I ran out of those sorrys and I'm hurting emotionally for my wrong doings and I shouldn't have done those things to ex and I don't know how to be a better person or how to fix my own self and I had a trouble time to chose who I wanna be with because I can't stand giving anymore pain but clearly I'vesnapped last night and I had decided what it was but with out any control of my will and I let my demon side chose for me and now I'm feeling like the most awful person on this earth and I don't know what I could do to fix my own bad actions and my ex was the one I loved the most and I hurt them badly and my mentality is lower and I don't want to be a bad person anymore\nAnd ive broken ex's snake terrarium, ex's necklace, and bit ex's arm and I want to try to be a better human being and I'm afraid what will happen next after im done with these charges and I'm not sure what I could do after my bad actions and bad mind set I want to fix my wrong doings but I don't think I can\nEdit: I'm not trying to blame anyone other than myself and I want to confess how horrible I am and wanting to talk this out here and I barely have any true friends who I can talk to about this and wanting to learn how to be a good person once again\nEdit2: i apologize for my actions but not expecting for a forgiveness from anyone just feel sorry for ex and ex family edit 3: I may not give all details due to poor perception and judgment and I also forget on a lot of things because the brain injuries I've received growning up and I've always acted before thinking and this is my result of it",

            "comment": "Buddy, you are sure in a pickle.\n\nRe: the charges, do what your lawyer says (get a lawyer if you don't have one) and stay 100% sincerely contrite.\n\nThe loss of your control is on you. 100%. It's never possible to blame drugs or alcohol because it's you that chooses to take those things. It's not possible to blame provocation because it's your reaction that counts. It's not possible to blame a situation, that you have created yourself.\n\nYou seem to have realised that, pretty much. Hold on to the realisation. This is a learnable moment.\n\nAt some level it's quite simple to be a guy. If you work hard, get shit done, don't put your shit on others, be reliable as a colleague and a friend, then you're most of the way there.  Likely none of that's beyond you, OP. So there's your future path of hope.\n\nIt starts with facing squarely up to the practical realities of the situation OP. So listen to the lawyer and do what they say.\n\nBest wishes, OP",

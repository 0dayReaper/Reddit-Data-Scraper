    "postText": "(suicidal ideation, sh, gender, sexuality, other teenage worries)\nI wish I was still a kid. I wish that I was still innocent to the world, unaware of my body\u2019s \u2018flaws\u2019, that I didn\u2019t have to try so hard to just to survive one day. \nWhen I was in year 6, I started to feel more apathetic to the events in my life. I didn\u2019t feel the same sadness as my friends as we finished primary school, nor the excitement to start high school. \nIn year 7 I began to have suicidal thoughts. like \u2018what if I just jumped off this building. and cracked my head open in front of everyone\u2019. I wondered how my family would react. The thoughts seemed normal, since a lot of the kids in my class talked about it. We made jokes out of our feelings. My home room teacher was concerned, and sent me to counselling. But I didn\u2019t attend consistently until one or two years later.\nI don\u2019t know exactly when I began to sh. I just know what I used. Not sanitary at all, it was my sister\u2019s stanley knife she used for arts and crafts. \nThe night before my 13/14th birthday, I planned how to kill my self. Something about growing older pained me so much. I cut myself that night, a lot, and cried my eyes out. My family had decorated the house with balloons and streamers, but I didn\u2019t get out of bed for hours. When my mum came to check on me, I had a breakdown, and made them take down everything. I still feel bad about it, but that\u2019s when my excitement for my birthday completely died.\nI won\u2019t lie, tiktok really affected my mental health. I had fallen into a side of it that highlighted the evilest parts of society. it only fuelled my thoughts.\nI\u2019m in year 11 now, and it only just hit me how long i\u2019ve felt like this. The fact that the majority of my teenage years have been spent in this way. \nI don\u2019t feel justified to feel like this. I\u2019ve been born into a great family, in good living conditions, with the privilege to do whatever I want. I\u2019ve never had to experience hardships.\n\nAt some point I began to hate my body. not just in an aesthetics way, but the very fact that I was born female made me want to die even more. I kept thinking that if I die now, I might have the chance to be reincarnated as a boy in my next life.\nI hated my chest, I wanted to cut them off.\nI\u2019ve had body image issues since primary school. i\u2019ve always been a bit chubby. Just enough that everyone sees it, but doesn\u2019t pick on it. i\u2019ve always been the heaviest sibling in my family. So when I hear my sister say she\u2019s fat, or that she needs to lose weight, I can\u2019t help but resent her for a moment. Her feelings are valid, but it\u2019s just not true.\nNow, although I\u2019m still uncomfortable in my body, i\u2019ve made some kind of peace with it. I\u2019m not going to transition for the simple reason that it wouldn\u2019t be \u2018authentic\u2019. What I yearn for was to have been born a boy. To grow up as a boy. Deep down I know it\u2019s not the only reason. it\u2019s partly because I don\u2019t think i\u2019d make a good boy. I wouldn\u2019t achieve my ideal look or feeling. i\u2019m not tall enough, and I don\u2019t have the right parts. \nThis is what i\u2019ve been feeling for the last 4-5 years, along with other things. And honestly, i\u2019m starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I feel like if I make it through year 11&amp;12, i\u2019ll be ok. there\u2019s so much I want to do and experience. i\u2019ll be ok.\n\n(I know this was long, but feel free to share your feelings as well. it would give me comfort to see that other people have also had these experiences)",

I didn't need to wonder what my family would think if I died, I knew all to well.  They would shake their heads and say \"He always was a loser\".  Each of us has their own cross to bare.  Some are heavier than others.  I hope you find some kind of peace in your life.  Just know you are worthwhile regardless of how much you may have missed.",

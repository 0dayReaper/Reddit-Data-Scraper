I got out of my car to look.\n\nI don\u2019t have a gun I didn\u2019t have a blade. So I just. I just got back in my car and aimed for his head. It seemed like the right thing to do at the time. I mean, it was pretty much instant, right? His brain was crushed. He wasn\u2019t gonna make it right? His guts where everywhere and it was 1:00am he would have bled out before anyone would notice let alone get a vet, but a vet couldn\u2019t have fixed that either right? \n\nI\u2019m not the asshole right?",

We're supposed to be the ones who swoop in and save them with all our fancy tech. But sometimes we just can't. Putting my dog down due to that failure felt so humiliating. The best I could do for her is kill her quicker than the other thing would've",

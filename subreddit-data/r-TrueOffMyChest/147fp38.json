    "postText": "I feel like I\u2019m a failure to anyone I meet, I keep having nightmares about my abusive ex girlfriend who used to hit me for talking to anyone who was a girl and her teachers thought I was the problem and she just abandoned me for new friends and she never told me anything about walking with other people and it just hurts my heart thinking about it, then her new boyfriend says I was the reason she was upset and it\u2019s so annoying thinking about it. I feel like I\u2019ll never be a successful guitarist or be a good musician, I sometimes feel like the rest of my life will be loneliness, I say a lot of words that end up hurting people and I don\u2019t ever think twice before I say things and it\u2019s all my fault, I\u2019ve been keeping these feelings since last month and it\u2019s making me feel more guilty the more I keep thinking about it and I Also think a lot about people at my school who just want to hurt me so badly, there\u2019s this kid that would always bully me in my gym class only because I was with his ex girlfriend who is my abusive ex and she would throw shit at me and try to just hurt me badly, I\u2019ve reported him to the school countless times but they do no shit and I could\u2019ve almost gotten myself in trouble for trying to get him to fuck off once, I also really hate everyone in my school because everyone just gossips eachother and everyone is just really rude for no reason. I\u2019m scared to just go to school after summer",

            "comment": "First I want to say that your feelings are valid. Second You are not the reason for her being upset. Sometimes people do and say things to make themselves feel better. Doesn't make it right though. I can't speak for your music ability but if you really are passionate about it don't let other people stop you from pursuing your goals. Something important to keep in mind when talking with other people is your intent (I often put my foot in my mouth and try to keep this in mind) it doesn't fix how your word may affect people but it does make it a little easier when talking to people( I hope that made sense). Tbh when it comes to school and dealing with bullies and people who love to gossip I really can't offer much. Try to find people who you can feel safe with. I wish I could offer more but I am just graduating this year. Wishing you the best",

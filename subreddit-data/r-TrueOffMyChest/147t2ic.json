    "postText": "My (f late 20\u2019s)sister(mid 30\u2019s) was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and now everyone keeps telling me I have to take care of her. How I need to not be selfish and put her first. I\u2019ve always put other people first from the time I was 11 and my mom got sick. My sister couldn\u2019t stand to watch my mom be sick and refused to deal with it. So from as far back as her original diagnosis I have dealt with my moms sickness while managing my own anxiety and depression alone. There was one time my mom was so sick she could barely stand and my sister refused to drive her to the er so I went with my mom and luckily a friend was able to drive us but she couldn\u2019t stay so I did. My mom spent two weeks in the hospital and not once did my sister visit her. I\u2019ve taken care of everyone nearly my entire life and when I ask for help i get nothing. I contemplated suicide and managed it all by myself because every time I ask for help I\u2019m met with \u201cyou\u2019re the strong one\u201d \u201cI have things to deal with figure it out\u201d. I have finally started living for myself and now I\u2019m expected to give up everything I\u2019ve worked for. It doesn\u2019t seem fair and I know that I am selfish but I want to be this time because I\u2019ve never been able to. I don\u2019t want my life to revolve around someone that wouldn\u2019t do the same and I know I\u2019m the asshole for it but I can\u2019t bring myself to care.",

Be there for her but don't speed yourself thin. Be the better person in the situation, just because she didn't help years ago doesn't stop you from just being there for your sister. :) It's hard to be in her position and all the love and support from you is what's needed.",

But they don\u2019t want to because they don\u2019t want to put themselves in that position. But since OP doesn\u2019t want to help either than she\u2019s deemed as selfish??? Yeah no that\u2019s ridiculous. Her family should be the ones to step up if they care so much let alone have the audacity to make those comments.",

Stand your ground. You deserve to live your life freely don\u2019t cave into it please. Your not in the wrong nor a bad person for standing your ground. You are NOT selfish, if anything all those people who left you to deal with your mom (including your sister) are the selfish ones. It\u2019s time to put yourself first and move on with your life and if you have to cut contact with those who are pressuring you in order to hold you back then cut those people out of your life. The only reason why they want you to set aside your life is because they don\u2019t want to set aside their life themselves.",

Again all of those family members pressuring her to help are more than capable of doing so. OP can still Visit her sister without helping. But it honestly shouldn\u2019t be on OP to help out when she\u2019s done more than her fair share in her family. It\u2019s not right that they rely on her constantly just because their lazy themselves.",

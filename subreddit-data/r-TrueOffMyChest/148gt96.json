    "postText": "I am a 25 year-old (F) but often get asked if I\u2019m a teen. Or, if people ask for my age, it\u2019s usually met with this surprise and their opinion of the age they think I look like.\n\nI hate it. \n\nBeing 5\u20190 and smaller framed doesn\u2019t help my cause and I get how it contributes. But, I don\u2019t want to hear your opinion. I am actively working on gaining muscle/weight to help my confidence and aesthetic goals, and I don\u2019t need the unsolicited mention that externally I don\u2019t align to your thoughts. Please don\u2019t tell someone they look 15, especially after they\u2019ve disclosed their real age, it\u2019s not taken as a compliment, at least by me. \n\nEvery time, it takes a hit on my confidence and I am tired of having to turn the other cheek. Sometimes I can brush it off, but other times, when I already feel small, I really do care.\n\nRight now, I care. \nI hate you, random tow-truck guy, for our dumb interaction that triggered me.",

Folks still think I am 10-15 years younger. One day you will be happy for your baby face &amp; body-it just may take several years.",

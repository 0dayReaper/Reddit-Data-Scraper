    "postText": "I cheated. My partner and I met each other when we in middle school. Our parents were always skeptical of our relationship, thinking it wouldn't last, but fifteen years later, here we are.   \n\n\nRecently, she asked me about marrying her. She wanted to have babies and start a family. I didn't come from a particularly great home life (I lived through too many divorces as a kid), so I was reluctant about marriage. Marriage also started to make me think about intimate relationships.   \n\n\nSince we met at such a young age, we had never been with anyone else. Because I wanted to make sure this was what I wanted, I asked my partner about potentially experiencing sex with other people. She said she wasn't interested, but if I was, I could do it, but keep it to myself (so long as the relationship wasn't emotional)  \n\n\nIt's very difficult to begin an affair, though. I didn't want anything romantic. I just wanted to know what I was missing out on. So, I hired a sex worker. It wasn't particularly expensive. She was a lot older than I imagined. At least twenty years older than me. We tried to have sex and were penetrative, but it was awkward and uncomfortable, so we stopped trying. I spent the rest of my hour talking to the sex worker about her profession.  \n\n\nWhen it was over, I went home feeling like it wasn't worth it. Like I had wasted my money and the experience was empty and hollow. Then it dawned on me: maybe that's what most meaningless sex is. It's empty and hollow without the right person. i  \n\n\nBut now I know. Now I know what it's like to be with someone else when my fianc\u00e9 has only ever had sex with me. I feel so terrible for what I've done. I'm also so scared that I contracted an STI (though I know it's unlikely).   \n\n\nI feel so guilty. I know I'm in the wrong. I feel like I've messed up beyond repair. My partner never deserved this. She's so good to me. I've tried so hard to be good to her. We're best friends. Yet, I betrayed her. What kind of best friend does that? What kind of partner does that?  \n\n\nI just want someone to tell this to. I want to tell it to her, but I can't because I'm afraid it'd all be over. She said not to let her know it happened.   \n\n\nPerspective would help. I expect harshness. I probably deserve it.",

Having transactional sex with another person isn't anything like having sex with a person you're attracted to and have even a minimal connection with.  It would neither tell you you're doing the right thing marrying your partner, or that it isn't the right thing.  It's the same as trying to decide if you want to live in Texas the rest of your life by spending an hour in Montana.  I'm gonna chalk this up to immaturity but you kinda need to talk to your fiance.  The seed has already been planted in her head (by you) that you cheated on her or want to cheat on her.  That seed will always be there and will grow over time.  Your best option is to be fully and completely open on why you wanted to be with someone else, how it went and what it made you feel (maybe leave out the sex worker part, just make it a random girl).",

As a woman, I can say that if you facked up but still willing to stay together or at least to be a friends, you could get the best possible outcome from your situation by being completely open and honest with her, dont lie and make false facts. Tell her about your TRUE emotions, how you felt before and after your affair, about your immaturity, etc.  Because I see here that you regret about this. In this way, you have a chance that she will understand you, but anyway, it is up to her judgement. Women live more emotionally  than men, and if you try to deliver your emotions, at least she will try to understand your side. But anyway, cheating is cheating, and broken vase will never hold water like used to, so it is up to her what will be next.",

If his partner was actually happy to be in an open relationship they likely would have had an in depth discussion about exactly what is okay and what isn't. Or maybe not since it isn't culturally common, and so OP is directionless with how to proceed even though this *technically* isn't cheating but *feels like it* to him",

I commented this without reading properly, then read it properly, realized my initial assumption was very wrong as I didn\u2019t read the full story, and lazed deleting it as it usually would end up lost in 1 upvote comments.\n\nThis guy got permission from her to do this. And this guy is regretting not because he wronged her but because he is carrying a disgusting feeling with him. Which happens to many people after a not so pleasing sexual encounter, and is amplified if it\u2019s their first time doing something.\n\nWhat I have to say to OP is, you two are one of the only couples who has only been with each other exclusively. Everybody else hasn\u2019t. I know that it\u2019s hard to come around and see it from your perspective, but from a normal perspective having slept not only with her in your life is totally normal and not something people need to be ashamed of. You got her permission, you tried in order to not live without ever knowing if there is something for you two to learn, for both of yours\u2019 sex lives to become better. You had a miserable experience, and obviously all of the feelings come down crashing badly. But none of your moves were nasty. You are a good person. And honestly I commented this fully thinking to delete it after, it was simply my way to vent and be comic with myself about my own miserable day.

And not regrets it because it's probably hurtful for his girlfriend (bringing up wanting sex with others, going to and f-ing a hooker, etc.) I wonder what he would say if it was a good lay with a young, hot girl. \n\nI would be surprised if OP asking for a \"hallpass\" wouldn't be constantly on her mind, if she wouldn't make up scenarios in her head. I wonder if she is really ok with it or she just said it's ok with her because that's what OP wanted to hear and she was afraid he will break up with her on the spot if she says no.",

For me though it was just food.\n\nMarry her if you still have strong feelings for her and make sure she doesn't regret one day. Write a diary and make sure you don't forget what you did and what you regret. If you have kids make sure they are loved and you are there to support them.",

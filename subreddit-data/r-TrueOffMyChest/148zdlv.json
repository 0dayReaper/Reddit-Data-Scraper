    "postText": "I'm an 18-year-old female and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life, I have very few friends in my new school, and no job because I'm still in high school, but other than that I feel like my life has no direction I'll be graduating in May 2024. I'm thinking of joining the Navy to at least try something, but due to my autism I'm not sure about that, I have high grades in school specifically in math and science so maybe I should go to college and do something with my life after that, but I feel like I'm not at that same level of life fulfillment like other girls of my age or what I picture when I was thirteen-years-old, a bunch of friends, a boyfriend, more freedom, and a good grip of my life but no, I don't know what to do with my life anymore or what do with my life.",

But I was army, navy is different. \n\nOtherwise don\u2019t worry, and don\u2019t be afraid to take a year or two off and just work. And/Or go to college part time to start knocking out your AA at a community college or something. \n\nAt the end of the day, the sooner you choose a decent direction the better. But you still have a lot of time. \n\nIt\u2019s better and easier to be like 21-25 and have finished college or a trade or be somewhere with a lot of potential than being 30 plus and deciding to finally go to school.\n\nEnjoy, have fun, be smart.",

The most interesting people I know haven\u2019t figured out what they want to do with their life and the are north of 45.  \n\nThe one thing I will tell you right now is don\u2019t sign up for the military until much closer to your HS graduation as this isn\u2019t something you can take back easily.  Feel free to contact recruiters of all the services and look at what they each offer, just don\u2019t sign up yet.  \n\nI can tell you one civilian job that will pay you well with only a limited amount t of experience is travel CNA which  usually requires a year of long term experience.  $35 an hour is not uncommon and you could get most of that year experience working part time during your senior year on the weekends",

    "postText": "People, dear people.\n\nThis is my first post on Reddit and I pray to not be the last one. Just now I have read news about the potential invasion to the territory of Ukraine today in the night.  I\\`m (f 25)  panicking here. People... I just want to live in peace in Ukraine. I\\`m proud of being Ukrainian. Here is my motherland and doesnt matter which places I visit around the world I love Ukraine with all my heart and soul. I love Ukrainian people.I want to live in Ukraine, I want to give birth to children in Ukraine. I want to speak Ukrainian language. I have no hate to Russian people and Russian language or any other natonalities or other languages. I watch how Russia bites huge pieces from my country and destroy all Ukrainian what exist there. I\\`m so much afraid this will happen with all Ukraine. I\\`m afraid to lose my nationality. Believe me or not, the worst what can happen to Ukraine is to be Russian.Why tf they destroy lives of usual Ukrainain people? Russian president pretends to be a God so he can decide the destiny of the whole nation.\n\nI\\`m so much f\\*cking afraid right now.\n\nWhat to do, people? I\\`m crying at loud here because I actually have no choice. I don\\`t know what to do. I\\`m desperate. I don\\`t want to run away from Ukraine and watch how Ukraine suffers. I don\\`t want war but it seems Russia has already decided.I just want to survive this war.I want my family will survive. We will fight till we die here for our nation.\n\nBut... but if Ukraine lose this war. This is not guilt of Ukrainian people. This is the collapse of worlds democracy.\n\nPeople, never ever trust to Russian government. Never ever trust to Russian news. Live in peace, never make war.\n\nP.S. If Russian government would occupy Ukraine and would ever say that we wanted to be Russians, you should know that nobody asked and we have never wanted.\n\nP.P.S. Apology for all the mistakes.\n\nEdit: I really try my best to answer to everybody, thank you for all of your support, people... Personally me greatly thankful and every your message is greatly appreciated by me... and be sure every Ukrainian who reads it",

He already said he would be ready to fulfill M.A.D. if Nato stepped in, and once the threat was on the table no one would be willing to send the species back to the stone age for Ukraine.

Western sanctions don\u2019t matter because the west just wants to keep Russia down and would use any excuse to do so. \n\nHis conclusion was that he was recognizing Eastern Ukrainian provinces as part independent and then he immediately signed a treaty with them foe mutual defense. This is problematic because 1) those provinces are recognized as Ukrainian and 2) the Ukrainian military still controls land there. This means that Russia is senind a \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d force into Ukraine who may very well now fight the Ukrainian military in open battle. The next few hours will be interesting.",

Why would some poor slob on a farm want to risk his life in a war when the best that he can get out of it is to come back to his farm in one piece? Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship.\n\n**Gilbert**: There is one difference. In a democracy, the people have some say in the matter through their elected representatives, and in the United States only Congress can declare wars.\n\n**G\u00f6ring**: Oh, that is all well and good, but, voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.*",

I'm in my fifties now and remember almost getting into a fight with a seriously drunk, amped up and really aggressive Swede at Monsters of Rock in 1986. This guy literally weighed twice what I did. War Pigs came up and while he was about to strangle me I told him to listen to the lyrics. He ended up letting go, crying (He was seriously messed up), and being sorry. Anders is one of the nicest people I know and I've never ever seen him be aggressive since. (Good thing, he is a big dude...) He was not \"mean\" really before, so it is not like the song \"saved\" him. Still a good friendship origin and a great song.",

Over there, when a bad earthquake hits something happens that never gets reported on but is just as terrible.  Around the areas that are hard hit you will see more cars with license plates from other areas.  It's well known but unspoken that these are people who traveled from outside by car to loot, steal, and in some cases rape.  A coworker of mine had her home broken into while her husband was out.  She was assaulted by one such burglar but managed to fight him off with help from her young son who was also home.  Point being, when society descends into chaos it will bring out the worst in people but not particularly people there but from other nearby places too.  \n\nIf things go south, and I sincerely hope it doesn't, you and your family should have a plan that will a) keep you as safe as possible and b) keep you well stocked with the basic necessities (food, water, shelter).  Have plans for escaping and meeting up if things get bad.  Stay safe and stay proud of your heritage.",

The Finns lost some territory in this war, which led to them joining in on the Nazi invasion of the USSR in what was called the \u201cContinuation War\u201d. Of course, I\u2019m sure you know how that invasion turned out for the Nazis. Afterwards, Finland effectively fell into the USSR\u2019s sphere of influence during the Cold War.",

Ukrainian immigrants support each other.\n\nTake care of yourself.\n\nPack what you need, make a plan, and see who in your family will join you. Have a plan ready.

To summarize: pack your essentials now. Send your older or younger family off now to whichever communities you can find that will help.

The people of Russia and their opinions are nothing when it comes to policymaking. Basically any form of publically going against the government is functionally illegal. Raise our concern? The sad reality is that a small group of people makes all the most important decisions and everyone else can eat roasted nails if they disagree. Stop placing the responsibility for the actions of a fascistic dictatorship on the victims of its regime. Stop antagonizing Russians for simply trying to survive.\nWe don't want war.

The stupid ironic ultra-nationalist subreddits like r/2Russophobic4you have been a good escapism method but the awful thought of an all out war between us and Russia is always in the back of my mind and the fact that I'm struggling in university does not help at all, as I fear I'll get drafted, which would probably be the last nail in the coffin of my mental health. I've thought about suicide a lot for a while now and every one of those thoughts scares me to no end, and I've cried in bed the most the last half a year than I have in many years. It's awful. I sincerely hope that the situation doesn't escalate further but from what I've seen and heard, that hope dwindles by the day.\n\nIt's good to finally let this out of my head, and if you read through this, thank you.",

            "comment": "If it helps... In many regards, it's extremely difficult for Russia to \"win\" a war against Ukraine. Ukraine has an active military of about a quarter of a million with another 250k people in reserve. Ukraine is difficult to invade during spring and fall due to the rasputitsa and Russia's economy has difficulty dealing with occupied territory (see the water crisis in Crimea). Furthermore, the Ukrainian military is well-supplied with strong air-defense making it virtually impossible for Russia to gain air supremacy without major losses, something that's absolutely not desirable for Putin and the position in which he is. Not to mention, the Russian economy is heavily dependent on Europe and it takes a long time to change its economic focus towards a different market, the moment Russia attacks Ukraine, Europe and the US will come with sanctions strong enough to completely cripple the Russian economy. With that Russia simply needs to win a short war and take some territory in the east, maybe part of the Dniepr delta from Crimea to ensure water coming to Crimea... They can't take Kyiv, never. Putin's public approval is... Flimsy at the time being to say the least, only at around 65%, which is low for him, an economic crisis and a failing war in Ukraine isn't going to make that much better therefore, if this war happens, it's going to be a small one with hopefully not too much Ukrainian resistance... But you guys are making sure that won't happen... Ukraine won't fall, that's not a \"hopeful\" message, that's simple geopolitical reality.",

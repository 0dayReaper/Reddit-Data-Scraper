    "postText": "I have a boyfriend that I\u2019ve been dating for almost 4 years now, we started dating since we were in high school and we used to do almost everything together. Such as, spending lunch breaks together, going shopping together, basically any time we have together, we would spend it together. However, the past year and a bit, we have been attending different universities and thus, our timetables are different plus we both have jobs which keep our schedules very busy and have found little time to spend together. \n\nBefore, even if we couldn\u2019t go out we would be on calls playing games or just talking about whatever there was to talk about. I can see that this may seem like a clingy relationship but we have communicated a lot about how we should spend more time individually doing our own things and it has been working for us. But I\u2019ve come to realise that since our relationship, I have done little to no effort in maintaining the friends that I made before our relationship. So now when my boyfriend is busy with his things, I realise how not busy I am. \n\nUnlike me, my boyfriend games frequently with his friends and a couple of his friends are in the same degree as he is. He also has a lot of hobbies that keep him busy as well as active socially. This has lead the time we spent together from every hour of every day to having 30 minute talks a day before bed. I am in no way wanting to stop the life that boyfriend has established and is very happy in, but I cannot help myself almost feeling resentful towards him and I guess that just makes me a sad lonely bitch that has become too dependent on her boyfriend. \n\nEven during semester breaks, our weeks do not align which means when I am on break, he needs to study for his semester exams. I do not want to distract him from his studies in any way but I only ask for maybe a day  just to catch up and spend time together on a date. Or would that make me selfish and demanding?\n\nI don\u2019t want to bring this up with my boyfriend because I do not want to burden him or have him drop everything in his life so he can spend time with his too dependent girlfriend. I don\u2019t want him to be feeling guilty for enjoying the things he enjoys either, because that is the last thing I want to do. I know my attachment to my boyfriend is not healthy but I am trying my best to adjust to this new chapter in our relationship. \n\nI have picked up reading as a hobby but it is not exactly the most social able hobby. I enjoy reading a lot but sometimes I cannot sit there for hours on end just reading. Though there are many reading communities out there, I do not know where to start. \n\nI regret not keeping my friendships because if my boyfriend and I were to part ways, I would truly be alone. I don\u2019t just want friends that say hi while I walk past them. I want to have friends where I can talk about my hobbies together, go out together and do what friends do. I used to be happy to think that my boyfriend was my best friend as well but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a healthy thing. \n\nTLDR: I have an unhealthy attachment to my boyfriend and now trying to establish a more independent relationship , I have found it difficult to find the loneliness that I created for myself is comforting and I want to have friends.",

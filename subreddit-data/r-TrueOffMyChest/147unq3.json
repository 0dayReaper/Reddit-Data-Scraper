    "postText": "(sorry if this isn't well written, english is my second language and i wrote this after one of the fights and was still shaking a bit)\n\nThe story is simple and really common, my dad and my mom fight a lot. It's always my dad that starts, he just need to be in a bad mood and shit starts, and normally it's just stupid things he argues about and it always ends with the same topic: he should just leave this house and thar my mom is stupid and things like that. \nAfter this fight he goes to sleep or he leaves the house for work or just to drink. \nThey don't fight all the time there's times where everything is good but there's also times where my dad loses his temper like every day. He almost never talks like that to me, I'm his only daughter and he's really proud of me and even if he's mad he talks well to me, but having watching all my life him being a complete asshole to my mom made me dislike him to the point that nowadays i don't even talk to him, even if he strikes conversation I just brush him off. I hate him now, i don't even like to call him \"dad\" but im still under his roof and he still helps me pay for college and my things, so i know i should be grateful for him.\nBut what about my mom, she helps me too, in fact she was always there for me and my dad, she works, she cleans the house, she does the laundry, like she does everything for us, i don't remember one time that my mom stop doing that for us, even if she was sick she would still clean, cook, ect... and if she messes up or talks a different way with my dad he flips out completely.\nWatching my mom do everything she can for her family and having to deal with his shit breaks my heart everytime, i always find her crying after the fights and i know she struggles with her mental health which is worse. My dad also struggles with mental health, he had depression some years ago but never cared to being treated, he also became an alcoholic after not being treated for his depression. My mom never was diagnosed but i know that she's not mentally stable, especially with all this fights she endured for years.\nI want to help my mom, teach my dad a lesson, make him see what he's doing or something, i don't know what to do, my mom can't just leave him because even with her working she couldn't afford living by herself, my dad earns almost triple than her. \nI'm figuring out what to do about the situation, I'm almost 20 and i can't just stand here and do nothing, but still i don't know whats best to this situation, if you went through a similar situation or have suggestions please tell me.",

            "comment": "Does anyone stand up for your mom during stuff? Probably not the best to do it in a large fight, but if there is a light conversation where tempers and emotions aren\u2019t high and your dad is being a dick, point it out. \n\nMy dad would do similar stuff with my mom. Once my brother and I got older, we\u2019d side with my mom and/or try to shut down the argument. My dad would feel a little ganged up on but he couldn\u2019t argue with our reasoning and would back off. \n\nHe still does stuff but is a lot better than he used to be. But overall my mom and dad have a good relationship. Most issues are caused by my dad though",

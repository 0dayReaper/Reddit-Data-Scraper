    "postText": "Me and my boyfriend are both in a very healthy relationship. We had a little bit of a hiccup recently, but nothing major, and we\u2019ve both healed completely. But, just recently, I\u2019ve started having these dreams about \u201ccheating\u201d on them. I put it in quotes because in these dreams, we aren\u2019t dating. They aren\u2019t even present. And it\u2019s not like I have a desire to do this, I love them greatly, and I wake up feeling very guilty. It\u2019s not every dream, it\u2019s only happened twice, but it\u2019s made me feel very guilty. I want it to be clear we both love eachother greatly. There is absolutely nothing missing in our relationship and I would never and have never cheated on anybody. I would especially not do that to them, as I have zero reason or desire do that. I\u2019ve also been taking sleep aids recently, and noticed they came up as soon as I started on them. I\u2019m confused, and frankly, feel very guilty. But I don\u2019t know if I should.",

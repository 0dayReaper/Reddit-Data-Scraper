I want it to be tommorow so I can check. It's gonna eat me up all night. \n\nPlease God let it be be in my till. Please God for my sanity please. I wanna die I can't take the stress anymore. God damn myself and everything. I can't. I can't.\n\nI can't stop panicking. I wanna call my supervisor but I don't want her to be pissed at me. Why does everything suck, why can't I be normal?

It doesn\u2019t negate your progress\u2014it just means you have something else to learn. This will pan out one way or another, and you\u2019ll be okay.

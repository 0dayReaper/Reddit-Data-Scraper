    "postText": "TLDR; I'm still in love, and missing a hug that was too short and too long.\n\nI think I'm going crazy. I keep thinking myself in circles, and no matter how often I tell myself that this isn't a thought I am allowed to think about, I keep thinking about it.\n\nThe group I wrote about last time has dissolved. I said my goodbyes to some of them. Including B. Well, final-ish. Some people are moving, some are not returning to college. B is both.\n\nMy original post never got traction. I am really thankful for this. I just need somewhere to, simply, get this off my chest. I posted the original post a year ago, with a comment apparently saying something about 'if this still bothers me in a week'. It has been a year, and I am back in this... hard spot.\n\nI am still taken. B is still taken. B is moving quite a distance away. I am staying right here. I can't hurt my partner. I feel so guilty that B is so much in my thoughts, because he *can't* be. I can't let this continue, but I can't make it stop. I haven't even done anything. But I feel as guilty as if I have.\n\nI said goodbye to him in the last few days. I can't stop thinking about it. We hugged, and I tried to pull away after a polite amount of time. Not because I wanted to, but because I didn't want to make him uncomfortable. He didn't let go. We hugged for a while, and it was really, really nice. I can't- I can't stop thinking about it. Wishing I could hug him again. Wishing I 'accidentally' left something there so I had an excuse to come back- but these are not things I am allowed to think, I am *taken*. *HE IS TAKEN*.\n\ni miss him. i wish i could hug him again.\n\ni keep wishing things were different. that we- but that's not fair to anyone involved. I can't wish that.\n\ni want to cry and throw something and call him and block him. and none of those and all of them.\n\nthe crying, at least, has been happening a lot since then. and on the drive over.\n\nSomething in me wants him to see this. Something in me wants him to text me, to talk about anything. That friend group has told each other that we love each other before. A *philia* love- the greek concept of love between friends. I don't think this is philia love. And i'm so scared.\n\nI want to ask him if that hug meant anything.\n\nBut if I do, everything. EVERYTHING. falls apart.\n\nSo again, I sit here, writing it dead. Or trying, at least. this feeling doesn't want to die.\n\nLove is such a big word. It feels so large when I speak it. when I admit it, let it into the air like a breath that was ready to choke me. I've only spoken it twice to him. But it encompasses so much, and I put so much into it, and I don't know what he hears. When he says it, I don't know what kind of love he means. I don't know how much is lost in the air between us. That's such a fucking romance novel thing to say, *god* i'm so fucking stupid.",

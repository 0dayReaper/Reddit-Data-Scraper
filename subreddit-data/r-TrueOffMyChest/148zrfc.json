    "postText": "I\u2019m here with a gun sitting in my car. I really hate this world even though it\u2019s never really given me anything bad. I have loving parents sometimes it\u2019s hard to get along with them but I love them. I have the best brothers and sisters in the world. I love them so much. I have some good friends and some not so good friends. I have a friend that\u2019s been here through thick and thin and I love him more then words or life can say. There is one thing life truly fucked me over with. The friend everyone knew and loved raped me. It was under the bridge we all use to hang out by. He raped me and then took me to see a movie with all the friends that love him so much. They laughed and had a good time. Everyone talks about the after effect and the trauma that comes with it and you don\u2019t realize how true it is until it happens to you. But the worst part of the memory was the agonizing pain that was going through my body and the thoughts in my head as it happened. This was real. It couldn\u2019t be real. Four months later we moved. I was pregnant. It might sound crazy but I found comfort in the fact I would have someone to protect in the way I couldn\u2019t protect myself. I got a Job that paid 20 an hour by pulling strings. I bought clothes and bottles. I found comfort in the fact someone would love me endlessly even when I didn\u2019t love myself. I had a beautiful baby girl. She was perfect. The only thing that was wrong was her little heart didn\u2019t make a beat and her little lungs didn\u2019t breath. I prepared for the crying and staying up all night and made jokes it would be hell. Now all I can wish for is those endless sleepless nights to fill the room that I left for her. Her biological father laughed with the people who used to be my friends before I was pregnant. He said it was because god didn\u2019t want my daughter to grow up with a whore of a person like me or that my baby went back to where she came from which was hell. Now it\u2019s hard to even believe in a god that I use to. My best friend called me and he asked me if I was ok. I asked him why. He said he had a bad feeling and I wasn\u2019t talking as much as usual. He told me I couldn\u2019t die because I had appointments, because I have to fly out to see him soon, because my brother would cry, because he couldn\u2019t live without me. He begged for me not to leave. He said stay in the call I\u2019ll stay with you I\u2019ll fly out tomorrow please don\u2019t leave me. So Reddit I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t want to live the life I live. I can\u2019t change the things I want to change because they have already happened. I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019ll die today or maybe in the next few years. I can\u2019t tell anymore.",

But there is always another chance to make life more bearable and to start over. I am so sorry her father said those things that is disgusting\u2026 She\u2019s in heaven if you believe in that 100% and that kind of talk just shows his character. If you can please call your brother and have him come you deserve someone to lean on !",

Fight for you and all that you are. Look at a 10 year old version of you and fight for her. There's help, there's people to pull you up and out of this dark pain. Please put the gun down.

The pain is great but there\u2019s hope beyond it and even though it hurts so much now please know you\u2019re loved and you loosing your life is not justified. You can stay, you can get through this. Don\u2019t take that way out. There\u2019s more to live for and love, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s true in time.",

It sounds like a fairytale stock therapy answer and I know it might seem eye rolling right now, but it's true. \n\nI never know if these posts are real but I'd hate if it was and I didn't reply or do anything. You're posting, which to me shows a want to live. I'm no God and will never dictate what someone should do, but your hesitation shows to me you really want to keep living. So, gun down. Have a cry, a scream, a walk, a giant Toblerone all to yourself, whatever makes you feel a little better in this moment. It'll pass.",

But think about it, you are now down on the ground and your life can only improve from here. Please don\u2019t throw it away because of one bastard, as this is the way he wins. Your family and friends would miss you.\n\n\nAs you mention a gun, I presume you are in the US as we don\u2019t have guns readily available elsewhere. Here is a link to some suicide helplines. Please call or text one of them.\n\n\nhttps://www.dbsalliance.org/crisis/suicide-hotline-helpline-information/",

She would want you to continue on to better things. Your family would be heartbroken losing their daughter and sister. Your friends who care would miss you and wonder if they could of done something to help you. Seek help, like therapy. Find a way to cope with the horrible things you\u2019ve had to go through. No one deserves these things but you are here for a reason and that reason is to live and enjoy the life you\u2019ve been given. Please don\u2019t end your life. A permanent solution to a temporary problem is never the answer. I hope you find the answers you need and deserve to help you get through these challenging times OP.",

You lived and got through the toughest time of your life, what makes you think you are unable to do that now? You might think this will fix your problems, but what pain will you cause on those that loves you deeply? Your parents, your siblings, your best friend.. Do you really want them to feel that pain as well? Speak to them. Let them in. Let them help you. If not for you, live for them. They need you and you need them.",

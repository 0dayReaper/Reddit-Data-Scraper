    "postText": "This is my first time posting on reddit, I've seen so many stories some have helped me with the decisions I make in my day to day life which I'm grateful for, but today I'm sharing my own thoughts. \nI (21f) always feel alone, I'm constantly surrounded by people, I come from a big family even though we don't all live together anymore cause my older siblings all moved out but we get together often we share a bond like that, I'm in the university and I have friends, close friends, casual friends and many acquaintances but it always feels like I'm alone. I find myself crying most times. I try to make myself happy, I even think it's cause I'm single lol but I strongly doubt if being in a relationship again would fill the void I feel everytime and therapy is not something I could come by easily. I don't know who to talk to about it, I don't think I can express how I really really  feel to the people in my life currently. I really hate feeling this way.",

    "postText": "throwaway account, hence the username. this just occurred and i feel so lost. idk how to describe the amount of shock i feel, and i need to get this off my chest. i don\u2019t really know how reddit works and i don\u2019t know if this will violate any rules but i just thought this would be the best place for advice bc of videos i saw on tt. im prob gonna delete this later so my parents don\u2019t see it.\n\nso, i (14f) just got home from a camp today and my grandma came and picked me up. my brother (10m) was in the car with me. whenever we got dropped off, the door was locked so we decided to look outside for a baseball bat he had lost the previous day. (him and the neighbors play baseball w eachother, and the neighbor lost the bat).\n\neventually, we gave up looking. we were bored and went down the road just talking. we were cracking some immature jokes abt wieners, but we collectively make dirty jokes like that as a family, so nothing out of the ordinary. whenever we make jokes like that, even if they\u2019re dirty, they\u2019re often rooted in innocence of still finding that stuff funny. idk if that makes sense but\n\nme and my brother are both kinda socially awkward, so we have trouble carrying convo. after a few moments of silence, he asked me what the scariest moments of my life were. fortunately, i have a very privileged life and i have really never really been that frightened. even though ive had some low points ive realized how lucky i am to live in a good neighborhood, have good parents, and have financial stability. so i answered \"idk, hbu?\"\n\ni thought this question was really strange, but my brother is a curious little kid. he\u2019s always asking questions, especially about sports teams. it really drives me crazy hes honestly adorable. he\u2019s not afraid to ask questions and that\u2019s a good thing, and i often remind him of it. then, he started telling me abt the scariest moments of his life\n\ni don\u2019t want to go into detail because i don\u2019t want this to seem im exposing my brothers biggest secrets. that is not my intention at all (i simply came on here for advice.) but, he was over at our extremely religious cousins house and my only male cousin took him to a barn and made him climb up a ladder, making him unable to get down. then, from what my brother described, my cousin started jerking off right infront of my brother.\n\nbefore anyone comments \"well maybe he\u2019s lying!!\" i 100% believe him bc i have also been a victim of my cousins sexual abuse, but that was a long time ago. i am very fortunate to have already moved passed it, so i don\u2019t rlly want to talk about it bc i repressed a lot of the memories. \n\nbut, my brother said that my cousin ejactulated and then fell to the ground in \"pain\" and forced my brother to watch him for hours. i was in pure shock. of course, my brother didn\u2019t know what any of this meant and acted like it was funny and used incorrect terminology bc he had no idea the actual words existed.\n\nnow, this is the party where i def feel like TA. i felt so bad for my brother, and on that moment i just wanted to protect him. what angers me is that my cousin was 14 (he\u2019s a legal adult now) whenever my brothers and my abuse occurred and he was definitely well aware of what he was doing.\n\nmy brother is going into 6th and has never received the talk, as my mother believes he\u2019s too innocent. i asked him if he knew what the stuff that came out of my cousins privates were and he said no. so, i basically gave him the talk right then and there. i instantly regretted it. i took what he thought was a funny memory and turned it into a traumatic event. \n\ni just felt the need to protect him and i never want him to result the the coping mechanisms i used to overcome this trauma. i resulted to masturbating and self harm, which i still have problems with but for unrelated reasons. it just seems like even though I am over the event, it still is the root of all my issues, and likely one of the reasons i feel like I struggle with hypersexuality.\n\ni went through years of therapy just to overcome it, because my parents did not know to how to approach this issue. i felt so alone during this time and went to the internet to answer all my questions abt sex, and it fed made the situation worse. i know telling him that is such a shitty move but I didn\u2019t want him to fall down the same loophole I did. In want him to feel supported and feel like he has someone who will answer all of his questions.\n\ni felt so insanely bad for explaining all the stuff to him in apologized multiple times. i asked him if there was any touching or anything and he said no. but then he greeted me with a question; \"if he did do stuff to me, what could he have done?\" i explained to him anal sex in the most child friendly language i could think of and he said \"i think he did that.\"\n\nhe asked me a few questions that i answered to the best of my ability. he was visibly stunned, and i realized the mistake i had made. i basically just took my baby brothers innocents trying to protect it. i feel like a piece of dookie. why do i do things so impulsively? i told him I was sorry any a million more times and then i hugged him.\n\nas my dad was pulling up in the driveway, we concluded our convo. he made me pinkie promise not to tell our parents and i promised. but im so tempted. i want them to know abt this so they can have a proper sex ed discussion and so they can get my brother help. but, i don\u2019t want to break his trust or potentially get in trouble for informing him on this stuff.\n\ni noticed that he has been ating distant all day. he\u2019s usually energetic and outgoing, but he\u2019s just been staring off into space. i feel like ruined him. i keep on trying to ask him if he\u2019s ok and hugging him, but he told me i was being annoying and paranoid. even if it didn\u2019t affect him, i feel terrible. \n\nim sorry for rambling. the thing i came here to ask is if i should inform my parents. Me and my brother have been extremely close as of late and i didn\u2019t want to destroy that bond, but I also want him to be safe. thank you for your time, and every opinion is greatly appreciated. and for everyone going to criticize me for my actions in the comments, just know that I acknowledge what i did was extremely wrong, and it was a stupid act of impulsive, and i will actively try and improve myself. i hope everyone has a great day/night.",

Your parents need to know. Your brother needs to be able to get help and support to process and heal from this. And your cousin needs to be in jail. \n\nI\u2019m so very sorry this happened to you both. I\u2019m glad you posted here. The relationship between you and your brother will be okay, I promise you that he\u2019ll be glad you told your parents. Maybe not right away, but soon enough. Sending lots of love. Feel free to message if you want to chat.",

            "comment": "Tell your parents. I know it's hard and it feels like there is a lot at stake right now, but they need to know. They need to know so they can get your brother the help he needs, and so they can make informed decisions about how to navigate the situation with the extended family members.\n\nOne way you could help mitigate the potential damage this could do to your relationship with your brother is to include him in the process. I'd tell him your parents need to know and explain why they need to know, and then offer to talk to them either with him or on his behalf. Make it abundantly clear that you need to do this because you are concerned for his well-being and there's only so much you as his sister can do for him. This is way too heavy a burden for you and your brother to be dealing with alone. Remember, you are not his therapist, nor should you be. He needs to be connected with professional help, for his health and yours.\n\nGood luck OP. I hope it goes well for all of you.",

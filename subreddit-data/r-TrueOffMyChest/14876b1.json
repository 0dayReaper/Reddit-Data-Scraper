    "postText": "My boyfriend (24) and I (F23) moved in together about a month ago and everything has been great except for his drinking habits. He has zero self control when it comes to alcohol and will drink a six pack of strong mixed drinks in less than an hour. When we first started dating he did tell me that he used to have issues with alcohol but that he was past them. His dad had made a comment about it one day when he wasn\u2019t around, and when I approached him about it he said that he hasn\u2019t been like that in a couple of years. \n\nBefore we moved in together I had only seen him tipsy one time when we were celebrating an event together. He would drink his beer at home, several beers, but he wouldn\u2019t get drunk. \n\nLast night he bought a six pack of IPAs and a four pack of vodka mixed drinks. He didn\u2019t drink any of it last night because we had gotten home late. This morning before I went to work I told him to please moderate himself on how much he drinks because he had been drinking large quantities in short periods of time recently. I work the evening shift at a hospital and don\u2019t get to come home until around midnight on the week days. When I drove onto our street I saw him going back inside from his car. He wasn\u2019t wearing a shirt (which is very common for him while at home) and as soon as I pulled up he was already inside, went into the front room to do something, turned all the lights off at the front of our place and went to the bathroom. When I got inside he was starting the shower. I was suspicious, especially since he knows I like to shower when I get home and he usually takes one earlier. I was putting away some things in the kitchen and noticed the trash was completely empty whereas usually all of his empty cans and bottles would be. When I checked the fridge he had drank three of the IPAs and three of the vodka mixed drinks. I heard a load noise from the bathroom and I went to check on him. Sure enough he had fallen. I had asked him if he was okay and he said yes so I left him be. I instantly knew by how he was acting during that encounter that he was drunk. Over the course of the next fifteen minutes he had fallen two more times. Truly I feel like an asshole for not helping him out of the shower after the second time. The last time I helped him out of the shower, helped him dry off, and told him to go to bed. He didn\u2019t resist and I went to take a shower myself. When I got out I felt conflicted and uncomfortable. He was asleep in bed but had sent me a few texts saying that he was sorry and that he is a \u201cdrunk bastard\u201d. He said \u201cI did the best I could today. I\u2019m sorry if it wasn\u2019t enough.\u201d I\u2019m currently laying on the couch just trying to get my thoughts together. He has never been rude or harmful to me when drunk but I do feel uncomfortable. I feel like he is trying to hide it from me even though it is blatantly obvious. \n\nI understand that he may be going through something mentally but I have tried to have as much open communication about mental health as possible especially given my history with mental health issues. I am worried that this may turn out to be a much bigger issue down the road.",

Your boyfriend has an obvious issue, and this is already a current or present issue.\n\nIf he isn't willing to communicate about mental health at all, yeah. This is all going to explode and become straight shit.",

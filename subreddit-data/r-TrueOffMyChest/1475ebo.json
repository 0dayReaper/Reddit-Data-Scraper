    "postText": "I wanted to write this sooner than I expected, but only got up the courage now. I (30, M) married my wife (29, F) about 5 years ago. I always saw her as a caring, loving person who was always concerned about me, but when everything happened, she showed herself to be a completely different person, I don't know if she pretended to be that way because of our marriage. After 1 year of marriage, we had a daughter (4, F). She is absolutely the love of my life, I adore her. My wife and I have always loved children so having a daughter was like a blessing to our newly formed family. Fast forward to the future, the pandemic caused me to lose my job. My wife continued to work in an office while I did jobs anywhere possible, as my wife and I fought regularly because of this. One of these fights led to her slapping me in front of our daughter, which probably made her uncomfortable, but she didn't understand about these things so I guess she must not even remember it. My wife always reminded me that I didn't have a job and our marriage was getting worse and worse.In a brief context, I didn't finish high school. This, at least in my country, makes it very difficult for me to find a stable job. I had tried to get a job in several places but it never worked out. So two days ago, I came home early after helping to make some deliveries for extra money. I entered the house, only to see a scene that simply never left my mind. My wife was there, in the kitchen, having sex with a guy from her office. She saw me staring at the scene, completely unresponsive. She screamed in horror at the sight of me. I just wanted to walk over there and kill that guy, but I somehow managed to keep calm. I left the house, with my wife's car keys in my hand, since I don't have a car and needed to pick up my daughter from school. She came out of the house a few minutes later, with messy hair, tired and with red cheeks. She was probably having sex with that guy all afternoon. She looked at me, crying, telling me that she loved me and that she was sorry. I didn't know what to say. The only thing I could ask her was \"How long have you been doing this?\", which she replied \"Please, This was the first time, I didn't know what I was thinking.\"\n\nIt was a lie, I wanted to believe her but I couldn't. I got into the car without saying another word, driving to my daughter's school and picking her up. I needed to relax, so I just drove to some fast food place and bought us snacks. For a few seconds, while I was eating with my daughter, I forgot what had happened. After spending an hour with my daughter, my wife texted me, saying that she loved me and was very sorry for what she had done, and that she was at a friend's house in the office so that she could relax. I didn't answer anything. I drove home, only to find that guy sitting on the sidewalk, looking down. I got out of the car and put my daughter to sleep in our (former) house, then got out of it. I just watched him turn around, crying, saying that he didn't know she was married. I asked him to explain and he said that she basically lied to him. He told me that she said that she was single, and that her ex-husband lived in another state, and her daughter lived with her. He told me they never had sex in the bedroom, and that she always wanted this on the living room or the kitchen. That is why they never had sex there, since that is the only place where there were pictures of me and her together, and if he found out, he would probably freak out and stop to hook up with her. I asked him the same question i asked to my wife: \"How long have you been doing this?\", and he answered that they had been having this affair for 3 months. I didn't know what to say. I stopped feeling my body completely. I've never been so devastated in my entire life.\n\nI told him to go home, but he told me that he didn't have a car and that my wife brought him to my (former) house, and she was the one who drove him home. I felt a little remorse from him, maybe he was telling the truth, maybe he was truly sorry. I gave him a ride to his house, but we didn't talk the whole way. When we got there, I asked him if he had anyone, if he was in a relationship. He replied that he had a girlfriend. I told him to tell her everything that happened, to protect him, her, and their relationship. I said that she would probably freak out, but remembered him that he simply wouldn't be able to continue a relationship knowing that he cheated on his girlfriend. I said that, in the end, it was his decision to tell her or not. He just agreed and got out of the car.\n\nAfter that, i came home to keep my daughter company. I have never been so devastated and destroyed in my entire life and I have never cried as much as I have in the last 2 days. Now I can't think of anything else but protecting my daughter. I don't want to see that woman again in my entire life, and I hope to get a lawyer as soon as possible so that I can get a divorce.I will try to post updates whenever I can. And thank you for reading, I needed to get this off my chest and didn't want to tell my brother, who is the only person in the family that lives in my state. Also, sorry for any mistakes, i am not an english native speaker so it is very difficult for me to write anything in this language, but I tried my best. Thanks.\n\nEDIT: Since there's a bit of people confused, i did not let my daughter alone at home when i arrived the guy to his house. I called my brother to keep an eye on her. I just felt bad for the guy, maybe he was sorry, i dunno.\n\nEDIT 2: So, yeah, i felt like i needed to do this edit because there are many people talking about the fact that i drove the guy to his home. I felt bad for him, deep in my heart i felt truly sorry for him, so i just felt i needed to do this. And yeah, looking back it was a parenting neglect, even if my brother was taking care of her. I shouldn't have done this and this will probably have a lot of effect on the divorce case. Thanks for all the comments, will probably send a update soon.  \n\n\nUPDATE: I just wanted to give y'all a quick update on what's been going on. Right now i am already contacting an lawyer about what all happened and he said that my situation it's not so good and that i will probably will never get 100% of my daughter's custody, and the best option is to try to get a 50/50 custody, which i accepted immediately. I want my daughter to still see her mom, because that could be too traumatic for her too handle, her mom just disappearing from her life like that. Thanks for reading my comments, and i will stop editing this post, because i don't know if reddit has a character limit on these posts, so if anything new comes up, i will update in another post. And btw, thanks y'all for the kind words and comments, i felt really appreciated and all those advices helped me a lot. Thanks y'all!\n\nFarewell, Semper Fi.",

If the little one isn't his that doesn't mean that he isn't the father, he just isn't the biological one (important for medical information down the line). If he wants to continue to be her father he can, if he doesn't that's fine too.",

Also felt hella guilty, my ex didn't deserve that, he was a good guy, we simply didn't match, but that was in no way an excuse of my actions.\n\nSince then I've never cheated with anyone while in a relationship. I've had once had relationship that was going downhill because I was being emotionally and financially abused. But before doing anything or exploring relationships with others I broke it off.",

If you hear from others that they are a cheater or have cheated, they will probably cheat on you. Sometimes people just do it even without a history. \n\nThat being said, if you know this is a common paranoia for you, if you stress out about this even before getting into a relationship, if you haven\u2019t ever been cheated on AND still have this insecurity\u2026I\u2019d push you to talk to someone about it. Not even in a mean way. This can make relationships really hard to have, it can effect people who haven\u2019t even cheated on you if you let it.\n\nYou can\u2019t control someone\u2019s actions, you can only control how you react. It is normal to have this fear, but please know that not every person will cheat. Just shitty people. And if they do? Well, that person wasn\u2019t for you. It\u2019ll be okay even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it.",

If you have centers of support you aren't co dependent on your partner and have the chance to stand back up. If you increase the chances of finding out through positive means then you'll waste less time in a terrible relationship.  Having a good relationship with others for example means that in the event anything were to happen then someone might tell you that something is wrong. If a partner tries to isolate you then it's a red flag for so many things.",

You'll get a bunch of responses here that are wishful thinking, but what I just told you is reality and human nature. You also need to be aloof to the subject of cheating. Being paranoid of her cheating without reason shows your insecure and not stable in who you are as a man. No, your worth and don't let her knock you down. The saying that girls only like assholes isn't true. It's just that assholes tend to not put up with shit. You can be a good person, a good man and a good partner without being a dick. Check out stoicism. But most importantly work on that paranoia because like I said if you show that paranoia you just going to come across as insecure and not secure in yourself as a man.",

I can already feel that she is someone who will try to twist things, so when you do go to divorce her, don't let anything she says cause any doubt in your mind. You are doing right by yourself *and* your daughter. I will forewarn that, as someone whose parents got divorced at a young age, she will probably be confused about what's happening. The best I can advise is to spend some extra time with her when you can and be patient. It'll be rough for her too, she'll just need some time to adjust.\n\nI know you're emotionally in the gutter right now, but I hope everything goes well and that you come out of this with a good outlook on life still.",

If you still remember when it happened, write it down. As much detail as you can and take that with you to your lawyer. Not just for you but for your daughters sake.\n\n&gt;My wife always reminded me that I didn't have a job and our marriage was getting worse and worse.In\n\nThat's AH behaviour. It's not your fault for having a hard time and you're working whenever you can find a job. If it bothered her so mich, she should have sat down with you, her partner, and worked on a plan to improve your education (night school?) as well as help look for jobs.\n\n&gt;I came home early after helping to make some deliveries for extra money. I entered the house, only to see a scene that simply never left my mind. My wife was there, in the kitchen, having ...\n\nGood thing that you came home when you did! How much too early were you? Not that it really matters. What she did (and he to his girlfriend) is despicable. I cannot help think that she wanted to get caught (and blame her behaviour on your trouble finding a job), why else would she have sex in your house? \n\nDon't trust a single word that comes out if her mouth. Don't talk to her before you've spoken with a lawyer (today or tomorrow would be ideal). Is the house yours, hers or does it belong to both of you? Ask him about changing locks, are you allowed to do that. How to handle the situation with your child. Get a therapist for yourself and your daughter. Get a full STD test. Get a paternity test, even if you do not care whether your little one is your bio daughter, you will want to know for the divorce proceedings and for possible future medical needs.",

Don't get the wrong idea. I don't mean fixing things with your wife. If your daughter is an important part of your life, you should be careful when filing for divorce. It wouldn't be easy to get custody of your child, especially since she is a girl, odds are that the court won't rule in your favour. It's a harsh reality but something that you just have to accept. I would suggest taking some time away so that you can think rationally. I don't really know about your financial situation, but those are also factors you need to be concerned about. Divorces are usually very dirty. I wish you all the best.",

Imaging what they were doing, positions, how much she enjoyed it, etc. Very painful to cope with.\n\nSo I can't even begin to imagine what you are experiencing.\n\nMake so mistake, what you experienced was trauma. Nobody died, there was no danger, but it was traumatizing all the same.\n\nI encourage you to seek therapy and get ahead of this. You might never see it again with your eyes but your mind will be replaying it in your head for a long time and it will take a toll on you. \n\nGood luck.",

            "comment": "I'm so sorry this happened to you! You sound like a really kindhearted good man. Your wife not only cheated on you but also lied about how long the affair has been going on. The fact that she cheated on you in your own home shows how little respect she has for you. She is angry with you and wanted to humiliate you by doing it in your home. \n\nI'm sure that you are in such pain, but don't let that destroy who you are as a person. Even when confronted by such an awful sight, you thought of taking care of your daughter and even the man whom your wife was cheating with. I would think the other guy was a decent man, except that he has been cheating on his girlfriend too. I do believe him about how long the affair has been ongoing. He waited for you to come back home despite not knowing if you would harm him. That shows courage and that he truly felt bad for being complicit in destroying your marriage. \n\nYou must decide whether you want to stay in this marriage or not. You should go to therapy regardless because that will help you to get past the pain and anger of betrayal. Next, consider furthering your education because that will help you in securing a better paying job so you can better provide for you and your daughter. Finally, forgive, not for them, but for yourself. No matter what your wife has done, you are tied to her forever because of your daughter. It will be better for your daughter if you can co-parent in a healthy, drama free manner. \n\nPersonally, I can forgive a betrayal, but I would not be able to stay in the relationship. It would destroy my peace of mind, wondering if they were lying or cheating on me again. I would not like the version of me that I would become. I don't have children, so I do understand why people with children try to salvage their marriage. It is commendable to put them before yourself. Divorce is terrible for children, but so is a toxic relationship. Good luck with whatever path you choose for yourself! No one deserves this, least of all you!",

DBL deception is a stank :(\n\nYou deserve to have a supportive spouse. Covid created plenty of cracks with job losses, but it also tested the common values and ethics of couples to be able to ride out the storm and support each other in hard times. This is the pains of marriage. You seem fairly young still and if divorce is not something you can afford to speed up or really want, try therapy and working it out with your wife. You don't have to forgive her, but see if you can find it in you to discover if it's purely lust or more...and hopefully find a balance and the strength in your heart to both raise your daughter together while you separate for the time being until a divorce is really deemed to be the best course of action. \n\nTake of your mental health too. This is very important to not ignore whilst keeping things as normal for your child.\n\nGodspeed OP \ud83d\ude4f",

    "postText": "To put things into context, my wife is constantly working. She has what I can only describe as a high profile office job and is constantly doing meetings with clients (either from home or from the office). Over the past two years I feel like she has been making less and less time for me, her husband. Which is tearing me up inside because the first eight years of our marriage were so great, but these last two have felt empty. Two years ago I also lost my county job. I have been looking for other jobs, but I have been using my time to moderate several subreddits (which I used to do before I was unemployed as a hobby, but now I take very seriously as a job). I stopped working out and as a result i have put on a few pounds (70+ lbs). We are no longer physically intimate. I have been listening to a lot of mens dating and vitality type podcasts for advice on how to treat her but it seems all the effort I put in only makes her avoid me more. She has taken to constantly nagging me to do dumb things like doing the laundry or making the bed in the afternoon when I wake up when she KNOWS that moderating comes first for me and I wont always have time. I am starting to become really dissatisfied with her as a wife. I have been hinting to her that she should stop focusing on her career so much because that's not what a woman's role is, but she angrily brushes me off or yells at me and calls me a \"lazy slob\". That is too far in my opinion. This stress from our relationship has been really getting to me causing me to eat even more. What do I do?",

Late days at work. Unaccounted for time, dead bedroom, nitpicking and belittling you ...all of these are associated with you losing your job thus your role as provider ended. \n\nIf I was you, if you wanted to remain married to her, it's time to stop wasting your time and energy on unpaid volunteer stuff, hit the gym, get on a diet, get back in shape and get a job.... Focus exclusively on you and become the best damn you that you can be....maybe, just maybe, she'll recognize her old husband and re-kindle what you had. But you need to take those steps now and in drastic fashion. She's already checked out of the marriage on an emotional level and is likely already got 1 foot out the door.",

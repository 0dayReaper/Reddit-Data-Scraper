    "postText": "When I was in the 7th grade, I had a massive crush on this boy. In gym class one day completely unprovoked he told me I was the ugliest girl he\u2019d ever seen. I went home and cried all night. Later that week during a \u201ctruth is\u201d on Facebook his friends said I was uglier than Rosie O\u2019Donnell. I never thought I was ugly, I definitely wasn\u2019t the prettiest and I for sure was awkward back then. So this completely killed what little was left of my self esteem and confidence. \n\n\nFast forward to today, that same guy, now 15 years older asked me out at a coffee shop, telling me how beautiful I was (he didn\u2019t recognize me). His friend also liked me on hinge last month, both of which I shot down. I feel like I won a battle for my younger self and it feels incredible. Fuck you both.\n\nEditing to add: wow thank you all, didn\u2019t expect this to blow up. Also whoever reported me to Reddit for possible depression, I\u2019m legit fine it\u2019s not that serious stop blowing up my messages about it please.",

I'm honestly a little bit concerned at some of the comments.\n\n12-years old is when puberty is ramping up to maximum and everyone's awkwardly learning to socialize with the opposite gender. A few boys are lucky to have role model men to learn from, but most learn the hard way through experience of what's acceptable and where to draw the line. /u/Jaded_Aging_Raver's comment sounds on point to me.\n\nThis isn't to invalidate OP's experience or how she felt; he was a little shithead, and she was hurt because of it. I also happen to think that 15-years is long enough for him to have grown up and reflect on his actions. No, she doesn't have to forgive him. What she did is perfectly valid and reasonable too. Speaking for myself, but I would hate to be judged at my current age for the actions I took as a 12-year old.",

If it does, you have way bigger problems and your hollywood-slayguurl revenge won't fix that either.\n\n\nEdit: TLDR: not an asshole; just a kid. Grow up",

You don't have to hang out with people who bullied you or go out of your way to interact with them, but forgiving them and moving on with your life is an absolute must.\n\nI am the first to say there's a decent list of people I absolutely do not fuck with on any level anymore, that's just a matter of learning from the past - but I do not hold grudges against those people or take satisfaction in their misfortune anymore, it's just not healthy.\n\nIf he's an even bigger ass now then so be it, like I said, there's nothing wrong with rejecting him. You know he's unpleasant and there's no reason to interact with him. But at this point you're a grown woman bent out of shape over the words of a 12 year old, words that were directed at an entirely different person from the one you are now at that.

You are mixing two things that shouldn't be mixed. I never said that \"it's nothing\". Things that happen as kids can and often are scarring. OP is completely in her right to have been hurt. \n\nWhat we can't do is assign adult responsibility to children and act like what they do as kids is indicative of who they become as adults. And you are right, I did bully as a kid. I was a child from a broken home who wasn't taught any better and reproduce the lack of empathy in my environment. Then I become and adult, my brain grew and I was able to see that isn't the type of person I should have been or would like to be or raise my kids as. It's not the \"gotcha\" you think it is.",

I was a good kid for the most part, but I wasn't by any means harmless at times, brash, loud, arrogant, insensitive.. and I sometimes hurt my peers without meaning to. But what this kid did, goes beyond what I can comprehend. Actually vicious. From your experience as a teacher, does this correlate with something the parents are (or are not) doing at home?

They're 12, you never know what's going on in their head.\n\nI'm not saying that's OK, but to hold a grudge for 15 years over something like this seems rather petty to me. I don't think about the people I had in my life when I was 12, but I suspect that if I met any of them again, I'd at the very least give them the benefit of the doubt and start with a \"clean slate\".\n\nWho knows, maybe both those guys have made some serious growth and would apologize to OP for what they did when they where dumb kids.\n\nI know I did some really fucked up shit as a kid, also had some seriously fucked up shit done to me as a kid. That's just the way she goes, you know?\n\nI want to add that I had a teacher once, that was bullied heavily when he went to school. During his reunion which he didn't want to go, the bully was the one person he talked with the most.\n\nAdults simply aren't the same as they where as kids\\teenagers, some are completely different people.",

So why talk to them.\n\nSo in a way I am grateful to learn a lot from my past now, but if an old bully apologized or explained their reasons, that wouldnt interest me either or make me feel better.",

Girl who was warned away from me tried her best lines. I shook my head and said \"ewww no\".\n\nAs I thumb type this I realized that back then I was sitting in a chemistry class.

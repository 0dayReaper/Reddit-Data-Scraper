That\u2019s the norm for humans, to be slightly positive.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, CBT can be helpful, but it\u2019s a process and if you\u2019re having more chemical than mental problems, then it will honestly only help a bit. \n\nEither way, getting a good treatment plan can make a huge difference.",

However; I have a bit of personal philosophy I\u2019d like to share. \n\nYes life is weird, it\u2019s trash at times or even all the time, we feel like shit, it hurts emotionally and physically, it makes no sense and there may not be an afterlife. But there are good things that come whether we want them or not. So why not just finish it out, ya know? Death is coming no matter what. It\u2019ll be over eventually, why rush it something that\u2019s going to happen 100% with time. Let time take you and just fuck around with this life thing until then. Try to enjoy or if you don\u2019t then honestly don\u2019t worry because time will fix that too when the reaper comes.",

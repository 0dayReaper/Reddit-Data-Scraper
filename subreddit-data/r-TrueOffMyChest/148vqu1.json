    "postText": "I (17f) had been told by my mom that her friend had been very inappropriate infront of my friend(16f) and her family, she said he would not be allowed back into our home however as of tonight just 10 minutes ago while I am babysitting he came into our house unannounced. She did not respond to my texts or call to her so I texted and called her husband and she finally answered his phone, they were supposed to go out to dinner at 5, it is now 9 and they are drinking. My mom said she would be home soon he ever every time she says that she is always home at 12-3 am. I am hoping this is different because this is her kids. My mom loves us kids and I know that she just grew up with a father that didn\u2019t treat her right and was inappropriate with her as well. I only posted this so I don\u2019t go down there and call the cops and get kicked out of the only place I can live at, at the moment. Thank you.",

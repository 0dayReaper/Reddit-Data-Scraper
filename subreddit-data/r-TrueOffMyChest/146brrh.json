    "postText": "My (34yr F) ex boyfriend (35yr M) called me on IG last night because I have his number blocked and he apologized for our break up in 2017 and said I was not crazy and he handled everything very poorly. This was better than any amount of therapy I have ever received. \n\nI have had nothing but bad relationships since this very difficult break up. I withstood problematic behavior so I wouldn\u2019t seem difficult or crazy. \n\nDon\u2019t fucking gaslight people. Do hold yourself accountable.",

I never hit her or cheated on her or anything like that, but I started fights and said a bunch of awful things to her in anger. About a year after we broke up, I stopped defending myself when my friends would bring it up, and realized just what kind of person I had been. Over the next few months it ate at me and I eventually couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. A couple days before I graduated and moved away, with the support of my then and current gf, I had her friend ask her to meet me in the library. We sat down and I told her everything that I had realized and apologized for the bigger issues I caused, as well as any smaller ones I could remember. Then I said goodbye and we parted ways. I\u2019ve seen her only a handful of times since then and we never spoke about it, but your post gives me hope that maybe my effort to make amends helped heal at least some of the pain I caused her.",

Since I moved on about 5 years ago he realized that I wasn\u2019t going to be waiting around for him to get his shit together. Since then he periodically apologizes for all of it. But, this last December is when he really truly apologized. I always felt like his previous ones were half assed, he would even write me letters but it always came back to him wanting me back so those apologies felt fake asf. But this past one, he finally spoke on the real shit that went down and just again, finally, owned up to the destruction of our relationship. I forgave him just only then after 10+ years of knowing each other. \n\nI had him blocked for years and he would find alternate means to talk to me. I was already over him for years but that actual apology was appreciated. Even after years it\u2019s funny how it could still be respected even tho I don\u2019t have much respect for him lol \n\nAnyway, this feeling you have now, don\u2019t ever forget it.

    "postText": "Hello, this is just a vent post, honestly. I 18 f want kids. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years and plan to have kids in about 4 years or so. But to be completely honest, I'm scared to have kids. I'm a victim of child sexual abuse. Every time I think of having a kid, I'm scared shitless I'll hurt them. My therapist has said it's an intrusive thought. But even saying it out loud makes me feel gross. Why would I even think of that? I was a victim from the ages 5-10(repeated, often abuse), it was a very close family member. I didn't tell anyone till I was 15. I'm scared mainly of the actual child care. Like breast feeding, diaper changes, and things in that nature. I feel like I'm almost violating the kid. I've never even held an infant due to this fear, like im a danger to them. It's irrational, but it controls a lot of me. I have nightmares. I feel just gross and disgusting even thinking about breastfeeding. But I deeply want kids. \n\nI know it's all normal things. I have to remind myself that. But in the back of my head, I just feel disgusted with myself. I feel abnormal. My mother went through the same abuse I did. She said she felt the same way about kids, but she was a great mother. I haven't processed my trauma, I'll be honest. I can say I was abused, who abused, and I can even joke about it(dark humor has always helped me). But whenever I go to say what exactly happened, I can't. It gets stuck in my throat. I think maybe I'll feel better once I fully process my trauma, but what if that never happens? \n\nThen I fear for the future of my kids. I was abused by an extremely close family member. What if that happens to them? Anyone can hurt them. What if I can't protect my own kids. I am so scared of what may happen to them. I know I want kids, I love kids. But i don't even know how to take care of a baby. What if I completely fail? I hate that my mind goes to that stuff when I imagine a baby of my own. Even saying I do makes me feel just awful. Why would I even think that? If you were a victim and a now parent, did you have these fears? How did you overcome them? Or at least work through them. My biggest hang-up is breastfeeding or changing.\n\nThank you for listening to my senseless babbling",

You are still a kid yourself (at 18) and should not even think about having kids for several years. (I wouldn\u2019t do this before 25 tbh.) \n\nYou are going to be a great parent. You are going to give everything careful thought because of your past. Nothings perfect but you will do fine and overthinking this is not good. Spend your energy and the bright side that you are going to be a bad ass parent.\n\nGood luck!",

            "comment": "Hello friend, its hard to be ready for kids. Most parents arent ready for kids for a lot of reasons. Sometimes its financial, sometimes its for professional reasons, sometimes they just arent mentally ready for it.\n\nSomething that became clear to me at a young age is that before anyone ever has kids, they need to overcome their own issues with their childhood. I know thats not necessarily what you want to hear, but hear me out. Asking yourself if you\u2019re ready for kids at 18 is totally normal, but as someone now in their mid-twenties, holy shit would I have been unprepared. I still am at 24. There is so much that goes into being a parent that can provide for their child than nobody in their early twenties could ever give. Unless thet had a small fortune. Kids are so freaking expensive.\n\nPlease for the love of god, pursue your passions first before starting a family, build a career, work on yourself, eventually you\u2019ll find a guy who will treat you well and it will shock you. Because it will feel like you are being treated in a way you dont deserve, and it wont be a passing grift to drag you back in, it will be out of genuine love. Then you\u2019ll be ready for a family. Just please dont make the same mistake so many do in their early 20s. Its your biology at work to make you want a family so bad, but in your 20s you just arent ready.\n\nAs a 24 year old, I hated when people said this to me, but looking back I cant believe I didnt listen. Your brain wont finish developing until 25, please dont make any major life decisions like a family until after that point. Theres a point sometime between 21 and 25 where things REALLY clear up mentally.\n\nYou\u2019ve got this",

            "comment": "It\u2019s always important to consider one very undeniable part about growing up and being sexually active, especially when you\u2019re just getting started:\n\nYou are your body, and your body and its chemicals/hormones accentuate certain feelings, but you are not your feelings. Feelings are often confused warnings of threat, or just responses to stimuli. It\u2019s very likely a lot of these feelings of revulsion/violation are part of your own previous trauma. None of that is your fault. Your brain is doing its best to process an event where you had no choice or control. Your anxiety about failure as a parent mirrors that loss of control in some respects, which may be why it is looming on your mind?\n\nTime will help. I know you have plans or have talked plans with your bf, but it seems clear that there is a lot of anxiety clustered around these plans, so maybe removing a time table for now is your best answer? You may want kids, but you have plenty of time to wait. I think part of the urgency you\u2019re feeling is just part of being your age. We wouldn\u2019t have survived as a species if we weren\u2019t super horny, especially when we\u2019re younger and most fertile. \n\nHaving sex and enjoying those feelings of a possible future with kids and your partner is very okay and very valid, but just because you have those feelings doesn\u2019t mean it must be real. Being a parent is about committing to shepherd and protect a young life, and helping them grow into who they deserve to be for themselves. It\u2019s a lot to take on and it\u2019s fun to think about! But I bet you have other dreams/goals too? At the very least I hope the 4 year plan you\u2019re referring to involves very steady work and saving to prepare, because even solidly employed careered folks I know in their 30s and 40s are having trouble affording kids. \n\nIt sounds like your mom did good by you, but until you feel like you can really protect that new life, whether it comes from your body or you adopt (because you can totally adopt), maybe now isn\u2019t the right time to think about these things?",

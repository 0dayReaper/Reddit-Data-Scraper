    "postText": "I was in 5th grade when this happened, I\u2019m in highschool now. \nA family had just moved into the house across the street from me in 2020, and long story short I started dating the eldest of the 4 boys.\nFor privacy reasons I\u2019m going to call him Issac.\nIssac was a freshman at the time, and like I said. I was in 5th grade.\nI didn\u2019t really realize this was wrong, and we ended up dating for 2 years.\n\nDuring that time period he did a lot of disgusting things to me, like.\n\u2022raping me while he had his friends record\n\u2022lighting me on fire\n\u2022trapping me in a old, mold infested car\n\u2022getting me pregnant, and forcing me to keep it\n\u2022cutting my with broken glass \n\u2022trying to push me into traffic\n\u2022and moving away with our child and not telling me.\n\u2022hit me, yell at me\n\u2022and honestly just abuse me\n\nYes, he was a terrible person. And I\u2019m not sure why I didn\u2019t break up with him. \n\nI\u2019ll give some more information about the situations. But I would suggest stopping if sensitive content triggers you (rape, sa, self harm)\n\nHe would hit me, and not like a small hit. I would have giant welts all over my body. And it would make me bleed and I have scars from it.\n\nOnce we were outside at a bonfire with about 10 people, with ages ranging from 9-16. And I ended up falling asleep with my head leaning on his shoulder. But I woke up to him lighting me on fire. Well my clothes, but I guess it doesn't really matter. It was still me. Luckily I was okay, but I was in the hospital for a while.\n\nI was sexually assaulted multiple time, as well as raped in our friends camper twice as they watched.\n\nHe also took broken glass and slit open my neck one time. Also resulting in a hospital visit\n\nI started self harming, and even tried committing multiple times because of the abuse.\n\nI ended up pregnant in 5th grade (I had gotten my period for the first time two months prior). But since nobody knew I was raped, I just said it was a mistake.\n\nI did end up having the kid, and for his sake, and my ex boyfriends sake I'm going to keep what we named him private. \n\nHe's about 3 now, and him and my ex moved away. \nI'm safe now, but I'm so traumatized that I can't go a day without thinking of it.\nAnd I'm so scared that my baby is hurt.\n\nWhile they still lived here, he almost drowned, and would always run off. \n\nI wish somebody had reported him, but he was very violent. Extremely violent. And would hurt anybody who tried.\nMy parents didn't really notice either, but I think it was because I was always outside, and they thought it was from just roughing around.\n\nBPD and depression run in our family, and I had been diagnosed around 6 months prior to everything. So they thought to attempts were a result of that.\n\nNobody believes me.\nAnd I'm so scared he'll do it again.\nI\u2019ve been to therapy, and many mental facilities. But nothing seems to help.",

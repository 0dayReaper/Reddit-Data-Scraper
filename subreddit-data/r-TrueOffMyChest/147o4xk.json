    "postText": "A little while back I made a post about how I hated working with my intellectually disabled coworker. The gist of it is that whenever she worked with me I would end up doing a lot more work than normal just to keep the bakery going, and I would end up frustrated and annoyed. What I left out was the fact that this coworker is incredibly kind and good natured, and while she doesn\u2019t do her job well she is a great person that myself and my other coworkers like having around. We have grown incredibly fond of her, so I do not want to have her fired as frustrating as she is. \n\nAt the time of making the original post, I had very little knowledge about disability services and what that entails. A plethora of individuals with disability knowledge came out of the woodwork and informed me of a few things: \n\n1: My boss is likely getting a tax break for having her work here and is getting a portion of her income federally subsidized\n2: she should have access to vocational programs to help her develop job skills \n3: based on my description of her working, my boss has totally mismanaged her.\n\nI was under the impression that if I spoke up about how poorly she was doing at work, this sweet disabled girl would lose her source of income and end up homeless, hence why I have been spending the last five months or so burning myself out and getting frustrated to pick up her slack instead of telling my boss about her performance. For some reason, a lot of people couldn\u2019t seem to grasp this, and were incredibly condescending and unhelpful by saying things like \u201cjust let her fail\u201d or \u201ccommunicate like an adult\u201d. Aside from those comments, there were a lot of helpful ones that assured me that I will be able to talk to my boss about this and probably get her into a better position in the bakery. So I did. \n\nToday was her first shift back since I talked to my boss about the manner. She came in later than usual, did the dishes, swept and mopped the floors, chatted with us a bit until the afternoon rush happened, grabbed a donut, and left. That was it. No food had to get thrown out, there was nothing put out late, everything went smoothly, and she is still making money and socializing with us. Thank you all for your support and info.",

He\u2019d lose food stamps, housing assistance, transportation assistance, plus his monthly check.  Basically it gives him a place to go 3-5 days a week where he can socialize with friends while feeling useful.  The money he\u2019s paid is practically nothing and he\u2019d go to work without the pay, but he NEEDS the supported workshop work environment.

For those who live not in a group setting it can be the only socializing they\u2019re able to do.\n\nThat said, not all disabled people need supported workshops and should not be paid only the pittance they earn.  I wish there was a way to change the system so people could work to their ability, be paid a normal rate, but still have things like medical coverage if they need it.  Sometimes people with disabilities have to choose between a job they desperately want and the benefits they need to survive and that isn\u2019t fair.  Things like Ticket to Work need to be better and more accessible for people.",

I worked at a place where I was making 100k, but I spent more than half on my medical needs. I also was fired for taking days off because of my disability.

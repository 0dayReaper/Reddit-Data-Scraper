    "postText": "Its literally tourist trap all year around. You can't go anywhere without million tourist being there. You wanna go to nice restaurant? Too bad it's booked for a year because of tourist. You wanna go to center of city? Too bad it's full of tourist. You wanna go to toilet at gas station? Too bad 3 buses of tourist just stoped for break. AND ECONOMY OH MY GOD. Everything costs triple then in modern countrys. They recently got into euros and now everything is more expensive. You can't even head to beach cause ice cream in like 3 euros a scoop and beach is again FULL OF TOURIST. Thank the stars we don't have tipping culture because those people would be ripping ud put even more.",

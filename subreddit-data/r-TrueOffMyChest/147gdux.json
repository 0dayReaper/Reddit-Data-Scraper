    "postText": "I hate my parents. I 20F dorm at my university and I let my boyfriend 23M stay in my room for 2 weeks while i was gone because he can\u2019t afford rent and i knew he was going to be pulling his weight since he was doing a minimum of 4 interviews a week while going to his part time job and i wanted to help with lodging and so he could visit our friends. \n\nMy parents found out and lost their shit because in their eyes my dorm is not my apartment to start adult living with other people, no it\u2019s actually part of their house despite 3 other strangers staying there. (Yes they were cool with him and their interactions were polite and inviting). \n\nI get it, if something happened my boyfriend wouldn\u2019t have been the one held responsible, but banning him from stepping foot in my apartment while they\u2019re 3 hours away?? loosing your shit calling me and him all types of strings of swear words?? telling me i can\u2019t have sex with my boyfriend then implying i did because i\u2019m such a whore and was wearing a cute top and makeup (we went on a date to a fancy restaurant and wanted to dress up).\n\nI\u2019ve been called a whore by them for the past year every time something i did didn\u2019t go their way and the last straw is making me put my laptop on all night with the camera on to watch my room and make sure i\u2019m not bringing him or his cat in here (roommate has a dog so having pets aren\u2019t being judged in here). \n\nThey spent hours digging into me yesterday and spent another one digging into me today even deeper. Fuck you mom and fuck you dad, if you think i\u2019m going to be your fucking monkey you can go fuck yourselves. Just drop me from the family already so I can focus on building my home and my family with the people who actually support me.",

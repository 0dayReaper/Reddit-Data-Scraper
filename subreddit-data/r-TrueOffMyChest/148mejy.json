    "postText": "Went on a date with a women other than my ex wife for the first time in 10yrs. \n\nShe was very nice and we had a lot in common, we got along very well. That being said any form of affection or desire was a direct association with my ex. \n\nI got home and just cried for the night, it was a really nice time but I just couldn\u2019t help that everything I was doing just reminded me of my ex. \n\nI texted the nice girl that I don\u2019t think we should see each other because I\u2019m still processing my emotions about my divorce. She was disappointed and sad but she understood. \n\nI\u2019ve let my ex go physically and I even thought emotionally but I was clearly wrong. I need to start to let her go little by little.",

            "comment": "Dating others while you're clearly not over your ex is just a bad idea. I know, I've done it.  Give yourself time to rebuild your life and heal from the hurt before you think of getting involved romantically. Although I know you didn't intentionally set out to hurt anyone,  it's unfair to the person on the other end. Things like this take time. Learn to be happy on your own first.  Take up a new hobby or two. In time you'll be ready, it's just not right now. Wishing you healing and peace \ud83d\ude0a",

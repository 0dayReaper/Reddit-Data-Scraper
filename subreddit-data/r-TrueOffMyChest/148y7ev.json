    "postText": "TLDR at the end because this is long winded af. I\u2019ve (F20) struggled with my hearing all my life, and I finally got it checked out in January of 2022. The audiologist told me I have significant hearing loss and would greatly benefit from hearing aids. I hesitated with purchasing them as they were quite expensive, especially through the clinic. I consulted my mother, who is also hard of hearing but doesn\u2019t wear hearing aids because she doesn\u2019t have a pair. She told me to think about it because she doesn\u2019t want me to go through the same struggles she\u2019s experienced her whole life (difficulty communicating with people, feeling left out, not being able to partake in jokes and conversations immediately, things of that variety). English is also not her first language so she also attributed some of these experiences to that. Seeing how hard it\u2019s been on my mom, I decided to do the 2 week trial that my clinic offered, thinking it wouldn\u2019t make much of a difference. Well, it changed my life. I purchased them through the clinic and paid them off in about $610 increments over the course of 6 months. It took most of my pay-checks and being frugal for those 6 months to pay them off. I also helped pay the bills at home during this time. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t realize at the time there were cheaper options. Fast forward to today, I cannot function without my hearings aids anymore, I\u2019m much more confident and they have changed my life. No more constant \u201chuh\u201d, \u201ccould you repeat that for me\u201d, or awkwardly laughing and hoping it was an appropriate response to what the other person was saying. They were my most prized possessions. I work a physically demanding job and came home from work extremely tired yesterday. Laid on the couch to nap, and I guess took off the hearing aids. At some point during my nap, they must\u2019ve fallen off the couch onto the carpet, and they completely slipped my mind when I woke up. Even went to bed with no memory of them. When I woke up the next morning for work, I opened the hearing aid case expecting them to be in there. When I didn\u2019t see them I assumed they were in my house somewhere and thought I\u2019d look for them when I got home as I was running late for work. Well, I got home from work and checked my usual spots. My grandmother noticed me rummaging through the couch and asked me what I was looking for. I mention that I had misplaced my hearing aids, but I was confident they were somewhere in the house. After watching me look around for a bit, she mentions that my cousin had found the hearing aids on the carpet and handed them to her. They were aware the hearing aids were mine and my well meaning grandmother wrapped my tiny hearing aids in tissue for safekeeping I suppose. Instead of telling me immediately she kept quiet about it, intending to play a lighthearted joke on me. I was not in the same place as my grandma at this time so by the time I returned, she had forgotten about the hearing aids. During this period someone in my house picked up that tissue and threw it away, thinking it was trash. It was garbage day. All the trash from the night before had been taken. I had nothing to sort through. I\u2019m so upset at myself, even though I didn\u2019t let anybody see it and reassured my upset grandma that it wasn\u2019t her fault and she shouldn\u2019t take the blame. $3k down the drain just like that. I\u2019m trying not to cry but I just feel sick to my stomach. I know the money can be recouped, but I have been working for years and my family is not well off. This is the one thing I really decided to indulge in and I\u2019ve lost it due to my carelessness. Fuck.\n\nTLDR; Struggled with hearing loss, got hearing aids. Misplaced them, someone found them, grandma wrapped them in a tissue for safekeeping. Someone in my house assumed it was trash and threw them out.",

But you don't have to take all the blame for yourself. It was intended as harmless but that's not what ended up happening, and your grandma does bare a good portion of the responsibility here.",

    "postText": "I 18(f) has been tormented by my older siblings since I was a toddler. They would always do something to make me cry and then laugh at my tears to the point where now as a teen im unable to express sadness or how I truly feel. I grew quite close to my older sister (20) but I don\u2019t have a bond with my oldest sister (24), and lately came to the realisation that I feel nothing but hate for her, I go out of my way to treat her the way I was treated years ago. Bullying her to the point of tears like she has done to me growing up, my grandmother and mother tells me to stop bullying her because she has depression but I feel nothing. I have no remorse for the things I put her through and won\u2019t except her as a sibling despite being blood related.",

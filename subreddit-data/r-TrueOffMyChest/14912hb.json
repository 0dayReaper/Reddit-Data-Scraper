    "postText": "I have a 9 month old baby. He is well, loves books, milestones are okay etc. I dress him in \"comfort clothes\" since he is squirmy and sometimes cries when he lays down and put on clothes.\n\nSo we have a group chat. I, my partner, his sister and his sister's wife are there. We send pictures and videos of my baby from time to time. If he hits a milestone, if we find something funny or cute, those stuff. But what his sister always comments on is his footwear. I became more conscious about what I send.\n\nI am aware that my she loves footwear. But what I do not appreciate are her comments. There was a picture I sent because I found it cute. But she asked if he has different socks because he looks pitiful since his socks are \"wash and wear.\" Then there was a time that he was wearing nice socks sent to me by my cousin overseas. She asked if it was \"hand me down.\" Comments goes on and she even said that even though we are at home, he should be dressed nicely. I prefer \"parent friendly\" clothes like frogsuits, onesies, those stuff. I sent another picture one time when our baby was in the hiking back pack in his pjs and she said that he should be wearing shoes. I said that it's better that kids his age are barefoot. To which she replied it's better he wears shoes so it would be hiking for real. I just said that it's better to go barefoot for development of muscles and to feel the earth. She even messaged my partner personally that he should wear shoes so he would be used to it.\n\nI talked to my partner, told him that I couldn't take her comments. I mean, I would appreciate it more if she asks how is he, does he already have teeth, is he walking, does he have words etc. But my partner is the type of person to brush things off so there won't be any fights. He tells me to let things go. But for me, those are stuck in my head and as a mother, I am hurt, pissed and it's hard for me to move on from her comments.\n\nSo I wanted to test out if she will comment again on my baby's footwear. I bought a pair of really cute socks and my brother sent me over two dozens of books. My baby was happy and excited. I sent a video in our group chat again that my baby is happy with his books and grabbed a book and started opening. And of course, as I expected, she commented on his socks saying it's nice and iust said he has a lot of books.\n\n I told my partner about how I wanted to reply with \"You really saw his footwear above everything else.\" But he didn't say anything. And as I said, knowing him, he'll just told me to brush it off. I really wanted to reply.\n\nI already left the group chat so she won't be receiving any photos and videos from me.\n\nEdit: She doesn't have kids and my baby is their first nephew.",

    "postText": "Obs: English is not my first language :) \n\nI've been sick for almost a week due to a lung infection and my boyfriend has been the best person in my life right now.  Making me company staying in the hospital,  waiting for hours and trying to make me laugh showing that he wasn't bothered to be there with me, making food, waking me up to remind me about the meds even helping me bath as i'm too weak these days and so so much more. \n\nDuring my childhood when I got sick no matter how much my mom took care of me properly she wouldn't stop throwing it in my face that it was my fault, sick or hurt.  It made me grow insecure and afraid because I always think it's my fault.  These last few days he has been taking care of me patiently and I will tell you, I am not an easy person.  This man is the man of my life and I hope I can repay him for everything he has done for me! I love him so much and now even more!",

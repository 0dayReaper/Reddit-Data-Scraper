Also you can try another approach which isn't for anyone. Try to realize and come to peace with the fact that life is hard. It's always going to be. But it's still worth living. And there are many people that have a really bad life full of suffering. Still they are going and they are stronger and stronger each day. There is and there always will be at least something to live for. Focus on it. I hope you find happiness in your life.",

            "comment": "Firstly I am sorry for your loss of both your uncle, auntie and dad. I personally understand how it feels as I myself (now 18) feel into a period of deep depression and isolation after my uncle (who I was close with) died suddenly when I was 13. I tried to commit suicide multiple times and I am so thankful I was never successful. Life is hard to be honest with you, but you are still young and it will get better. For me I felt having someone to openly talk to wether a professional or friends was so helpful. I know it\u2019s difficult to talk about these things but you will have to face your fears at some point and putting them to the back of your head won\u2019t help. You are loved and cared for.",

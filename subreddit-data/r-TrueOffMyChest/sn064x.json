    "postText": "I got to tell someone about this. I feel like I've broken the system at 23 years old. I have 0 student loan debt. I have a big house in a small town in the midwest and my mortgage is $900. I just landed a remote software engineer job for 100k plus bonuses. After all my expenses I'll still have over $2000 per month to spend how I want.\n\nI grew up in a poor family with 3 siblings so I have always thought 50k was rich. I'm kind of going insane realizing how much money I'm about to have.\n\nMy first priority is to get an emergency fund put aside. After that I have a bunch of appliances and home improvement I need to do. Past that point I'll just be investing and drinking a lot of lattes. I'm very conservative with my money so this will feel like being rich.\n\nI know it's not actually rich, and with inflation it's not as crazy as it feels. But still.\n\nEdit: Everyone is asking why I only have 2k left. After taxes and healthcare deduction I will only have 6k monthly take home. I also have property tax, home insurance, mortgage insurance, utilities, car insurance, car payment, a medical bill payment, and some other things. So yeah my monthly expenses are over 3k leaving about 2.5k remaining.\n\nEdit: I tried to respond to questions. Check the top few comments for most details. I'll try to keep responding to new stuff\n\nEdit 2: it's not smart to ask strangers online for money. Some of you are gonna lose a kidney like that",

As for the \"extra\" money... An emergency fund is good, but so is a \"dry powder\" fund for the right investments at the right time as you get older.

This will keep you invested so you\u2019re not missing out on growth in the stock market.\n\nEdit: Adding an edit to say that I love to see the discussion and threads regarding investing\u2014its great to think about and discuss these things\u2014but also remember we have the internet at our disposal. Please google these things as well. Any investing topic you google will likely have an [Investopedia.com](Investopedia.com) result that you can click on. Go there and read about the topic.    Also if any of the terms I use are unfamiliar or seem too jargony, then just look up the word and read about it until it all makes sense. Just saying the info is very very close to you but if you don\u2019t seek it out and educate yourself on it, then you won\u2019t know some super important things that you really need to know.",

Simply put: \u201cI\u2019ll just put it into ETFs and let them roll.\u201d =&gt; I'm going to invest my money into the stock market by buying something called an \"Exchange Traded Fund\" which means that some smart people collected a bunch of stocks for some purpose (usually to track some kind of sector or even the entire market) and then you buy a slice of that. It is generally considered a very good option for investment because it's spread across a lot of different parts of the economy (across various business industries, called \"diversification\"). A common ETF (that are designed to track (go up/down) with the entire market are SPY, VTI (tracking the S&amp;P 500 - largest 500 companies).",

That is gonna be our stock market. It has food (stocks) of literally everything you can think of. Buying everything in the store (on the market) would be incredibly expensive.\n\nThat is where ETFs come in. Instead of buying literally every food item in the store (stock market) you can buy a portion of it, lets say 1 of every food (stock).\n\nNow you realize you don't really care for the vegetables at the store (stock market) and really enjoy ice cream. Well, you can get specific ETFs that focus on your likes. You might ignore vegetables (we can pretend this is an auto (car) ETF) and you'd rather focus on ice cream (we can pretend this is a tech ETF).\n\nHopefully this explanation as a starting point will help make it clear for yourself or others who are in the same position.",

As others have said you need to modernize/specialize constantly. I am a solutions manager specializing in Azure and Dynamics. I have some coding experience but don't do much of it now. \n\nNow is a great time to learn something like Dynamics or Salesforce as both are low code platforms that have huge growth in career paths. You could get your Salesforce Admin certification in 3 months by knocking out some Trailhead badges and investing in some study guides. It may initially only net you a parallel move in pay but it will set you down a new path until you get more certs and experience on the platform. \n\nAlternatively, take what you have learned from your MCSE and get certified on Azure. If you like the admin type work there are paths for that. With just a few years of experience you will be making 6 digits. \n\nSome people will say that certs don't matter but they do. Even more so without a degree. If anything, its a great place to start for learning about the platform. I always discover new things I didn't know while studying.",

Having software that will filter out candidates if they don't have the right amount of key words in their resume, asking stupid behaviour based questions that has nothing to do with the job itself. Ok One might argue that 'they need to see how you handle pressure for example'.... but as long as you learn a boiler plate example from monster.com you'll ace the question. I don't know, until they fix this broken hiring process I'm afraid we will have to fake it until we make it. \n\nThe whole thing is messed up, 99% going for an interview today will have model answers memorized and perky attitude, it's almost expected. As for the 1% of people out there that can and able up ace interviews without sounding rehearsed where stuff just come out organically, good for you!! I know they exist as one of my mate is like that.",

Just keep that up and develop that habit, learn all the different technologies that interest you and eventually you\u2019ll realize you\u2019re ready for work. \n\nIt is definitely easier if you\u2019re a CS student because there are more opportunities for internships afforded to people pursuing degrees, but there are tons of self-taught programmers out there.\n\nI will say personally that I do a lot of practice and learning because I enjoy coding, but I would not be where I am now without that boot camp/internship course fast tracking me.",

Most of our compatriots will not see money like this until they are well into their 30's, maybe never. \n\nMy only recommendation is that money always has a way of getting away from you, no matter how much you make. Your problems will change from not having enough moneyto not feeling like you have enough money. I also grew up relatively below the poverty line. you will never feel like you have enough to be stable. You have to find a balance between saving/investing/spending that makes you feel comfortable and happy. I'm still working on it, and I'm currently in my 4th year on the railway.\n\nGood luck my friend, and welcome to some of the best years of our lives!",

                    "comment": "Not OP but I also bought a house at 23 in the midwest during the pandemic. A couple important things to note/pieces of advice for any prospective home buyer are: \n\n1. You don't need a 20% down payment - if you start with 3% you'll pay mortgage insurance until you hit 20% equity on your home (equity is important - the renovations you do and anything that increases the value of the property count towards your equity, you don't always pay mortgage insurance until you're at 20% of the sale price).\n\n2. Interest rates are hugely important. My interest rate is under 2.75% which is really good (most are around 4-5% and I've heard people say they're paying 7-9%). I got pre-approved at multiple banks and used the interest rates they provided to determine which one to finance through. Also, when a bank tells you the pre-qualification amount, that's the max they'll loan you but you still have to make a down payment. If they say \"we'll loan you $150,000\" and you find a $125,000 house, they'll only loan you $121,250 (+ closing costs if that's negotiated); that being said, if you find a $200,000 house they'll still loan you the $150,000 if you can come up with the $50,000 in cash. \n\n3. Learn to live well below your means - every penny counts when saving up for a house, renovations, or emergencies. Money spent on the newest electronics, eating out, and entertainment is money that can't be put towards the house. I'm not saying, \"never buy new electronics and never eat out,\" just think through your priorities. I, personally, only eat out (including takeout/fast food) when I'm going with friends or family. I also cook a lot of food at home (meal prepping is great if you like the same things over and over, I personally prefer to prep ingredients I use all the time, like onions, peppers, and seasoning blends/sauces). People like to shit on this kind of advice saying, \"eating buttered toast instead of avocado toast won't help me save faster\" but they're missing the point - instead of spending $40 to doordash a salad to yourself, go to the grocery store and buy the ingredients and make a week's worth of salads for $15. \n\n4. Find a real estate agent you get along with. Good agents will look for properties within your budget and will help you through the entire process and the agent is the person who acts as the middleman between you and the sellers. My agent also suggested a phenomenal title office (they're the ones who do the paperwork the buying &amp; selling agents provide to complete the transfer of the property from a legal and tax standpoint)\n\n5. GO TO OPEN HOUSES even if you're not super interested in the property. I was super nitpicky at houses I wasn't very interested in (just adding to the reasons I didn't love the house). This helped me realize and confirm what I really wanted, which helped me eliminate options when I had an agent actually show me houses. \n\n5. NEGOTIATE NEGOTIATE NEGOTIATE. If you love something on the property, ask for it - the sellers might be willing to sell it. Also you can often negotiate to have the sellers pay all closing costs (especially if the house appraises for less than the selling price). Also, anything attached to the house when you place your offer is included (light fixtures, mirrors on walls, built-in cabinets and bookshelves, appliances, TV wall mounts (sometimes the TV itself), loft or murphy bed frames (usually not the mattress), etc.). \n\n6. There are a lot of hidden costs to buying a house; research them so you're not blindsided when they come up. You need to put down earnest money when making an offer (usually a couple hundred dollars that counts towards your down payment) -- this shows you're serious about the offer (essentially it's refundable if the sellers choose another offer but non-refundable if you remove your offer). You'll want to pay for an inspection (have your agent go with you to the inspection and be sure the inspector walks you through their qualifications prior to the inspection - if you're not comfortable, you can find another inspector). You'll have to pay for an appraisal (this goes into closing costs, it's the bank's way of confirming they're not loaning you more than the property is worth). \n\n7. Some people claim it's cheaper to rent and sure, it might be if you just look at dollars out of your bank account per month, but what people forget is that a home purchase is an investment- you get your money back when you sell (and if you own for long enough and do a good job of maintaining &amp; keeping things up-to-date, you can get your money back and then some!). Need a new furnace? Sure that'll cost you money upfront, but it'll also increase the home value. Same goes for air conditioning, fireplaces, appliances, new flooring, the list goes on.",

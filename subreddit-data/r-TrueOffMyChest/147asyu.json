    "postText": "About 2 months ago, I had 2 friends over and we were playing monopoly and drinking. I landed on one of my wife\u2019s properties and jokingly didn\u2019t pay her and she took the money out of my hand. I locked her wrist in a joking manner (we roughhouse a lot it\u2019s apart of our relationship) and she acted like she got hurt and ran upstairs and slammed the door. I left to go spend the night at a hotel because she made it seem like she didn\u2019t want me in the house and my one friend came with. She told me that I sprained her wrist and it was swelling and I called bullshit on it and asked for photos and surprise there was nothing wrong with it and she tried to gaslight me and said are you calling me a liar. While me and my friend were at the hotel she ended up straddling my other friend and making out with him but they didn\u2019t have sex. About a week later she had told me that HE had kissed her and she took our dog and locked herself in the bedroom. I got really mad at my friend and cut contact with him. A couple weeks later I see him at work and he tells me that he needs to talk to me about the situation and that what happened wasn\u2019t how she put it and he has proof. I tell him to wait until we get off work. He tells me and shows me a series of screenshots. About a week after that night she had taken his number out of my phone and started texting him about the night and was saying stuff like the only reason I didn\u2019t sleep with you was because I was scared but I\u2019m ready now and was saying stuff about how horny she had been and that the what if\u2019s about that night was killing her and for the timespan of about a week was begging him to come sleep with her. After I read everything I drove home and went to go confront her. I blew up at her and immediately upon getting home tell her to give me her phone but she had deleted all the previous texts but she had a text from Johnson saying that he told me everything and said well shit okay. I told her I wanted a divorce and she broke down crying. After I had calmed down a bit I made her call her mom and tell her what she did. Her mom basically berated her for a couple hours and then asked me how I was doing. I said as fine as I can be or something along those lines. I told her that I will stay with her as long as she doesn\u2019t leave the house, let\u2019s me look through her phone whenever, cuts off all of her guy friends, and we\u2019re going to marriage counseling and sleeping in separate rooms. I said that I will check phone records to make sure she isn\u2019t going behind my back anymore and if she breaks any of my stipulations once I\u2019m leaving her. Later that night I end up drinking almost an entire handle and got blackout drunk. This part I don\u2019t remember but what I was told was that I had almost committed suicide with a shotgun in my closet. Since this day, the entire situation has been nagging at me. It\u2019s gotten better with time but I re-read the text messages and just think about the stuff she said in them at random times and i can\u2019t even stand the sight of her and just do not want to be around her when I do. Our marriage counselor has basically just been saying to put it in the past and look towards the future but I don\u2019t really feel like that is helping me actually move past it. It\u2019s just been eating me alive. I don\u2019t really know what to do or how to move past this because I was completely blindsided by it. She\u2019s shown no interest in cheating or had any red flags regarding that. But I don\u2019t really know how long our marriage can last if this happened within the first 6 months of us being married.",

I would be divorcing my wife in a heart beat.. sorry man, but i almost divorced mine just for talking to an ex of hers and how \"she missed him\" and he was STATES away from us, i drafted up paperwork and everything, she cut ties with him, she showed me everything to prove she was done and made a mistake, i took a job to move us all to JAPAN, and we also did \"marriage helper\" for 3 days.. She knows that after that crap, she literally has no room to fuck up again with me, i love her and i now have given her my trust back and everything, because i won't start over without actually letting her be forgiven.. but if she did what yours did.. i'd have my papers done and dessolution of marriage signed.. and i have kids and TONS of things to split with her, so a very complicating  and expensive divorce would be ahead of me, but it wouldn't matter because that's better then never trusting her again, considering how far she took that, AND messaged that dude later for more.. nope. C Ya!",

I think your just scared and fearful to do so and i understand buddy. She has proven to be untrustworthy and it will always niggle away at you. Say your away on a business trip or a stag do etc you will always be thinking what\u2019s she up to and it will definitely eat you up inside and cause anger and resentment. That\u2019s no way to live. Even if she never does anything like this again I can guarantee you will convince yourself she has and then that would cause more tension, stress and arguments. And the fact it was with your friend who is also a work colleague is even worse! Total lack of respect! so if it went further and had sex and the other dude let it slip in work it would spread through the workplace within a few hours and everyone would be talking about you behind your back thus undercutting you in your personal and professional life. Be brave for you and her leave the relationship.",

What an incredibly stressful way to live, never being able to relax into your normal persona when anyone is around to witness it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;If they see a man treating his SO like a wrestling partner, they might see him as an abuser\n\nThen they're presumptive idiots. Context is important, and the people you're talking about are blind to it. Why should a loving couple behave differently just because there are witnesses?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;or want to join in the rough fun also\n\nThen they're even bigger idiots. Ones who probably ignore issues of consent at other times in their lives to boot. At that point, you may as well say \"don't give your wife a kiss in front of others, because they may decide to kiss her too\".",

            "comment": "I'm sorry you're in this situation. You have every right to end your marriage over this. You have no obligation to stay together. Listen to you feelings, Luke. You feel betrayed, devastated, can't stand to see her because it just reminds you of your pain, and you and the counselor are talking about 'putting it in the past'? Who in their right mind expects a cheated spouse to just 'get over it' in two months time? Sometimes, your trust in someone is completely broken and cannot be healed. And even if it could be healed, you have to heal first. And ignoring your emotions, which is what you're doing right now, is not an effective way for you to heal. You're got drunk to numb yourself, if you don't address your feelings you have a good chance of becoming an alcoholic to cope with your internal misery. You need people around you (friends, family) to be there for you and probably therapy if you're very depressed. This kind of event is not something everyone 'gets over' if you give it some time. \n\nI look at it like this: healing a marriage after cheating requires a lot of things that are usually not present (and definitely not in your case): a completely repentant spouse, some remaining trust in and love for the other person, and great sacrifice and selflessness in the partner who was cheated on, and the rare ability of that partner to forgive and let go of their (fully justified) feelings of hurt and betrayal. NO ONE can demand or expect forgiveness from a cheated spouse. By all accounts, it seems you cannot forgive her this. Which is totally OK! I don't think I could either. Again, you're allowed to divorce. And definitely don't get kids with someone you resent. Right now, you're trying to run over your own emotions in order to 'fix' your marriage, which is just a terrible idea for everyone involved. If your feelings of resentment towards her or your lack of trust continue, you ought to listen to that and get a divorce. Take care!",

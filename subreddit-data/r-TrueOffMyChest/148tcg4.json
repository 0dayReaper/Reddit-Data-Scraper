    "postText": "Found out my premature son will need to have surgery on his skull to fix a suture that closed prematurely. I made the mistake of telling my mom I was falling apart and asking if she could come. She said yes and asked when. I told her today would be nice. And since she doesn't work, it wouldn't be burdensome.\n\nShe can't come today. Why? She needs to pick up a prescription for my dad tomorrow. But she could make it work in a couple of days maybe, sometime after 1pm. \n\nY'all.\n\nI have never asked this woman for anything in my life. Ever. And the one time I do, this is the response. And then she proceeded to call me dramatic for being upset.\n\nI have dropped so much in my life to help them. And I financially support them, too. I give them a substantial amount of money every month to supplement their income. I've just... In my head, no matter how abusive and bad they were, I thought that it was okay because they'd be there if I really, really needed them, even though they hadn't been there before. But now? \n\nYour grandson has to have surgery. On his head. Where his brain is. I can't stop crying. I'm vomiting. And you can't come because you need to pick up prescriptions for a grown ass man? I told her to not bother then, and she said, \"well, that's your choice. I'm here.\" No, you're not. That's the point. \n\nThat's it. Contact is cut off now. I can't imagine my son ever needing me for any reason and me not being there. But for her, no reason is good enough to inconvenience her.\n\nNo family is better than family like this. I am done.\n\nEdit to add: He was born during an emergency c section at 34 because I had full blown eclampsia, and he had to stay in the NICU for two weeks. She has not seen him or me. He is almost 37 weeks gestational age so is still premature.",

I don't care what time it is or where they are or what has gone wrong - they all know to call me and I will do whatever it is that I can to help however possible.\n\nOP, I'm so sorry that your parents aren't good people.

She gave me terrible, illogical excuses, but none so bad as the last one before I gave up on her: she told me she had to be home because she was having \"guests.\" I pried, because we're the only guests she ever has. \nIt was actually that football season was starting, and she didn't want to disappoint the people who park in her driveway for tailgating by not being there for them. Nevermind that these tailgates have been going on for decades, she often skips them anyway, and everyone could park at her place just fine without her. But it was those people--not her only child and grandchildren--who she \"had to\" be there for. \nI'm sorry your mom treated you like she did, because I know how awful it feels to suddenly seem to not matter to one of the most important people in your life.",

I stopped taking my pain killers so I could safely hold him and feed him while there. I checked myself out of the hospital less than 24 hours after my magnesium drip (what I was given for the eclampsia seizures) finished so I could be with him without worrying about them calling me back for pain killers and other meds.\n\nI think me acting for him like this made me realize even more quickly that my mother is a mother in name only. My decisions were completely without thought. I just didn't want my son to be alone even though he was safe in the NICU.",

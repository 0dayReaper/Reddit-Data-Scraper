    "postText": "Last year I suffered the worst breakup in my entire life. I felt like I\u2019ll never be loved again and that I\u2019ll never love anyone ever again. My world was shattered and I fell into a deep depression, lost a lot of weight and wanted to end it all.\n\nMy mental health was damaged, but I found a will to go on after awhile. \n\nI started dating this man 6 months ago. Met him on a dating app, btw. \n\nHe showed me what it feels like to be valued and appreciated. He supports me and never yells at me.\n\nIt was only this weekend when I truly realised I was super traumatised by my ex when I was at a bar with my boyfriend and I spilled a drink on his shoe and my boyfriend did not get angry with me at all. At first I got nervous and started apologising to him immediately, but he was calm and said that it\u2019s okay and it was just an accident and all is good and after that he kissed me. My ex would\u2019ve yell and be rude to me for this.\n\nI feel safe and cared for. My boyfriend makes me laugh and it feels like I can tell him everything. He never judges me and always tries to understand me.\n\nI am in love and I\u2019m happy. I deserve it and wanted to share it with you. \n\nThings get better with time and it\u2019s true! \n\nHave a good day!",

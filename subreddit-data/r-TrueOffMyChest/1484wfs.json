    "postText": "i dont really know if this is the right place to put this since i rarely ever use reddit but i really want to put this out in the open.\n\nall my life ive been treated like a mistake. i was used for my kindness and my inability to say no since a young age. im used to being abused and scared so naturally that would be how i still sometimes act since some of my home abuse is still carrying on since im still living with my mother. i know my boyfriend loves me and cherishes me but theres always an itch in the back of my mind saying that my abuse and trauma is keeping him here since he pities me. that is, until my graduation party happened last friday.\n\na little backstory: my boyfriend stole bracelets from a crystal bracelet shop a few weeks before prom and his mother found out and wouldn\u2019t let him go to my senior prom with me, even after i bought his ticket, bought a 600 dollar dress and rented a limo. i ended up taking my best friend to prom (she graduated a year prior to me) and he returned the matching bracelets he stole. i used to wear crystal bracelets all the time but they were always too tight on my wrists since im a heavier individual. you can probably tell where this is going\n\nfast forward to my graduation party on june 10th. his he and his mother got me a gift for my grad party. it was wrapped so beautifully and even came with a card. it made me so happy. i opened it to find the bracelet he stole for me. his mother bought it. its black moonstone with an evil eye for love and protection. im a semi-goth, so he got me the black bracelet to match my outfits. but here\u2019s the part that warmed my heart. he told me that he asked to add an extra crystal to the bracelet so it wouldnt be too tight on me like i hated. im autistic so it triggered my sensory issues. i gave him my crystal bracelets about a year ago because i couldnt wear them. he remembered that i hated my bracelets being too tight and did a small thing that made my heart flutter. he loves me and went into the store he stole from and asked the store owner to add an extra bead for me. (sidenote, my boyfriend has a terrible memory. i\u2019ll accidentally interrupt him and ill ask what he was saying and he wont remember, so knowing that he remembered small details about me proves he thinks about me and knows what i like and dont like. hes my everything and its nice to know i could maybe be his everything too)",

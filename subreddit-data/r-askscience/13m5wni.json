            "comment": "Yes, to some extent the drop-off in infectivity is greater than the drop-off of virus production. What can happen is that new virus can be produced and shed by infected cells, but the immune system can neutralize the virus before it can transmit to a new host.   In most cases this will be because of antibody binding to the newly-produced virus, but I think you\u2019d get a similar effect in e.g. the APOBEC3-driven mutations seen in some infections. \n\nAn example of antibodies neutralizing infectious virus is probably in COVID infections. It\u2019s common for PCR or sensitive antigen testing to detect virus shedding for quite a long time after the infection starts, even though this virus is not infectious.",

It's just that the strongest cells are able to join the attack after 10-14 days because they are incredibly tightly regulated (else they would attack the body and cause autoimmune disorders let's say). Those cells have very specific receptors that are made to bind only to the antigen of the viral. \n\nYour body creates thousands of those cells with many different types of receptors. The one that is able to bind on the virus, will start replicating into millions to attack the infection, hence why it takes a bit longer.\n\nFor infections that are less harsh on the body, such cells may be unnecessary and may be dealt with the normal neutrophils and other immune cells.",

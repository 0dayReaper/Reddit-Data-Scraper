The radar app I use has a radar option to view cumulative rainfall over the last 24 hours, and it really surprised me that downtown Fort Lauderdale got 20+ inches of rain (and surrounding areas getting a significant amount too), yet everywhere outside of the general Fort Lauderdale area had little to no rainfall. What weather patterns caused a massive downpour in such a localized area?",

It\u2019s called \u201ctraining\u201d. Basically a storm is slow moving and back builds on top of each other. This happens a lot when the flow is very weak, or you have multiple outflows (wind blowing in one direction) all converging on a central area. Also, these storms had precipitation water values. The higher the number, the more saturated the storm is and how much water it can dump. Hope this helps.",

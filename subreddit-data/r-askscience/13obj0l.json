            "comment": "When people say \"water is incompressible\" we mean \"for calculation purposes, you can assume water is incompressible.\" However, there is a really easy way to see that water is, in face, compressible- sound travels through water. Sound is sent via compression waves, so if the water could not compress, sound would not travel through it. But water is really hard to compress very much. For instance, at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, water is still over 90% of the volume it has on the surface. \n\nSo, put a whole bunch of water somewhere in space (like a whole whole bunch) yes, it would compress and would even start a fusion reaction (it would get hot enough due to compression that the hydrogen and oxygen would break their bond, and the H atoms would start a fusion chain).",

Space is mostly vacuum, dark matter, and dark energy.\n\nIt's really mind boggling when you really sit down and consider it. I look at e.g. the hubble deep field and think about how the photons collected to form that telephotograph (or whatever they're called) began their journey billions of years before the dust cloud that formed the solar system even existed, let alone Earth, let alone life, let alone humanity, let alone me.\n\nI do not recommend focusing on these sorts of subjects when in a state of mild or any more severe form of existential depression.

You can go between galaxies even.\n\nYou're immortal too so you can get right up to the surface of a star if you want, or fly through a gas giant.\n\nIt was absolutely crazy to experience the simulation there. You think you're getting close to an object but you're still really far away. You travel from one planet to another and see the one you left disappear under your feet, and there's nothing around you.\n\nLikewise, don't play if depressed the existential part messes you up.\n\nQuite honestly the game gives you this sense of fear and loneliness that is hard to shake. Even though you know your character is immortal you're alone and there's a whole lot of nothing.\n\nThen sometimes you get near a dangerous looking gas giant or stars with the surface forming and dissipating mega-mountains beneath your feet.",

Here on Earth you are constantly losing large amounts of energy to radiation from your body. Lucky for you, everything around you is also pretty warm (even on a cold day) so most of that heat loss is made up for as your surroundings radiate heat back at you. In space, all your radiative energy is just lost to the void. \n\nSo is our water planet close to a star? If so, it would boil enough water to create an atmosphere of water vapour and stabilize the temperature on the dark side (assuming waterworld is spinning). \n\nOr is waterworld far from a star? If so, it will boil off to the vacuum of space to some degree, but the surface would freeze pretty quickly due to the radiative heat loss. From there, it would continue to slowly sublimate just thanks to the low pressure.",

Here on Earth you are constantly losing large amounts of energy to radiation from your body. Lucky for you, everything around you is also pretty warm (even on a cold day) so most of that heat loss is made up for. In space, all your radiative energy is just lost to the void.\n\nYour body radiates a tiny bit of heat away, the vast majority is lost by heating up the air around you. Since there is no air in space, you retain your heat for far longer than you would here on earth, even when not in sunlight in space.",

You can have some reasonable approximations, but they break down if you use them for most things.\n\nExample: 'space is -270C'. Thats the temperature you'd reach equilibrium with the CMB. That kind of makes sense for random objects that are far away from stars. For a huge sphere of water its questionable. 1- gravity will be the dominate force, 2- unless it sprang into existence, it condensed from a cloud of water, which will generate a surprising amount of heat, and keep the sphere significantly hotter than -270C for a long time.\n\nNear a star you can calculate temperature using the solar radiation times the ratio of area facing towards and away from the star. This means you can make reasonable definition for the temperature of molecules, aka their speed. Of course you end up with 'relative to what' questions, but you can make simplification/assumptions in a solar system, but not in deep space.",

The density of water changes slightly with pressure but I don\u2019t think its behavior does.\n\nWater-Earth would be deep water ocean with ice core. Farther out would have ice crust with liquid ocean from heat of formation. Smaller would be solid ice unless there is source of heat like Jovian moons.",

These two, Ganymede and Europa, most likely have liquid oceans under icy shells. Europa's ocean is thought to be in contact with the rocky core, which is why it's a good candidate for life to have formed, and Ganymede's ocean is likely between two icy shells (or there may be multiple liquid oceans between multiple shells, like an onion). Callisto is also ice but is frozen all the way through, and doesn't seem to have a rocky core (this is called being differentiated, where heavy and light materials separate into layers. So Callisto is undifferentiated).\n\nEuropa and Ganymede are warmed because of tidal forces, as Io, Europa, and Ganymede have a 4:2:1 resonance (meaning, Io makes 4 orbits for every 2 of Europa's for every 1 of Ganymede's). So the gravitational pulling on each other keeps things warmer than they would otherwise. In fact, Io is so tidally heated that the entire world is covered in volcanoes and lava.\n\nThe Galilean moons are fascinating places!",

And water near the surface would likely be liquid water under an oxygen/hydrogen atmosphere.\n\nIf it is just a mountain-sized bunch of water in the inner solar system it would eventually boil off (like what happens to the water ice \"tails\" of comets when they stray too close to the sun)\n\nIf it is a star-sized bunch of water, it would actually turn into a water star and start fusing hydrogen under the immense pressure, which is pretty cool to imagine.

            "comment": "I see a lot of responses based off \"it would evaporate\" that are instinctual, but not grounded in physics/chemistry at all. \n\nIn most cases, the answer is going to be \"a ball of ice surrounded by water vapor\" aka a comet. There are edge cases though, including \"vaporized and dispersed\" if there's external heat input (we're too close to a star), and \"collapses into a star/neutron star/black hole\"\n\nYou can make an approximation of what would happen based on two things \n\n\\- Thermodynamics/conservation of energy\n\n\\- The phase diagram of water\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=water+phase+diagram&amp;rlz=1C1RXQR\\_enUS1055US1055&amp;oq=water+phase+diagram\n\nInitial conditions are extremely important for this question, because in a vacuum without meaningful pressure, water can't actually exist in a liquid state! Since the question as written specifically as \"if you made\", we have to make certain assumptions.\n\nFirst, we have to assume a reasonable \"gigantic\" size, which excludes anything big enough to initiate fusion or collapse into condensed matter. So lets say \"too small to be a star\"\n\nSecond, we have to pick an initial temperature and pressure, so let's just arbitrarily say we used a balloon (compression bag) and some heat input to make sure our ball is initially at earth's \"room temperature\" and \"standard pressure\"\n\nWhip off the bag, and the fun begins! First, the surface pressure is removed, so our ball of water is going to expand which will initiate some internal pressure waves that will set our sphere wobbling (which will eventually result in surface waves that will break things up.\n\nAs the pressure drops fastest at the surface, we can look at the phase diagram and see that our liquid water is rapidly going to start turning into vapor. But as evaporation is a cooling process and requires energy input, some of the water at the surface is also going to start undergoing \"deposition\" from vapor-&gt;solid (like freezing, but that's technically liquid-&gt;solid), which is going to nucleate into small ice crystals. \n\nSince water and ice both have reasonably high emissivity and ice especially has high albedo (low solar energy absorption), our sphere is going to also be both shedding heat via radiation and reflecting incoming solar energy. The whole thing is going to start cooling down.\n\nOnce the first ice crystals form, we're basically going to continue the rapid transition of liquid-&gt;vapor-&gt;solid. The crystals will start growing but since this is all happening very rapidly without any dust to nucleate around, they will most likely all be very small ice crystals. If we had some dust particles contaminating our water, we were a bit closer to a star, and conditions were \\*just right\\* there's a tiny chance we'd see some hella-cool massive zero gravity snowflakes, but that's another unlikely edge case. \n\nSince depressurization happens much faster than bulk cooling, what we'll end up with is basically an ice cloud - lots of little ice crystals in a cloud of water vapor.\n\nOver a much slower timescale, very weak forces are going to gently collapse the cloud. In addition to gravity, since water is a polar molecule, ice crystals will attract eachother electrostatically as well.\n\nIf our cloud is small (I don't have a numerical answer off the top of my head, but probably anything smaller than several kilometers), gravity won't be much of an influence, so electrostatic forces will tend to clump the ice crystals together and our cloud will turn into a very delicate snowball in space. The remaining water vapor will be displaced to the exterior into a cloud around the snowball.\n\nIf there's enough mass and gravity, the core might fuse together into a solid lump . Either way, we'll have made ourselves a nice little comet.\n\nThat's almost it. The only remaining variable is how close to the star our little snowball is. Assuming our sun, anything inside the orbit of Jupiter or Saturn is going to see enough heat and solar wind that ice crystals will get knocked off into the vapor cloud, and pushed out into a comet's tail that we'll be able to see from earth and then since you will be the first person to see it, it will get named after you!\n\nSomebody check my math and assumptions, but that should be pretty close.",

The Sun is on average is 1.4 times the density of water so a Sun _sized_ ball of water would most certainly have enough mass to start a reaction. You can have a star with less than 10% of our suns mass although the material from which it's made affects that number.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_mass",

            "comment": "My guess is, there would be an ice core, an atmosphere created from the evaporation of some of the water. In between? Well, I hope the conditions allowed for supercritical water because that would be cool. \n\nWithout calculations it's difficult to tell exactly what would happen. I would go about it by calculating the pressure and temperature conditions as a function of depth and then check a phase diagram.",

            "comment": "The general outcome would be (cold) boiling at surface, creating an atmosphere of sorts.  Would not get a very thick atmosphere because the stable vapor pressure is probably pretty low, but if there is no vapor phase above the liquid, one will develop.  What would happen at depth depends on the heat budget and thickness of the water column.  If thick enough (pressures get high enough), a solid core would form, or if temperatures are really low solid will dominate.  Depends on how hot this blob is to begin with and how much energy it is getting from other sources apart from the heat it contained at creation.\n\nThis is a difficult question to answer in any detail (without starting details to constrain outcomes) because liquid water moves around and carries a lot of heat with it when it does. Eventually, the \"blob\" will attain a steady-state heat flow where the amount of energy radiated out into space is equal to the amount of energy entering the blob from space (nearby stars, perhaps).  How much solid, and how thick the water and vapor layers would be, is very much going to depend on that heat balance (and whether heat is being generated inside from tidal forces or radioactive decay).\n\nCosmic rays and particulates will interact with the thin atmosphere and strip it away slowly, so new water vapor will come from the supply of liquid and/or solid.  Time frames involved will be huge so that giant glob of water will just be a giant glob of water, probably mostly ice, slowly dissipating into space.  A giant blob introduced near the sun will disappear one heck of a lot faster than one way out beyond Pluto would.  Think about how comets behave.",

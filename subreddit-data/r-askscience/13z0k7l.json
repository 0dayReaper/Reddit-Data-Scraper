They contain fluid and are lined by cilia - tiny hair-like structures which move with the flow of the liquid and trigger nerve impulses to the brain which are interpreted by the brain as movement or positional change. \n\nCombined with all of your other sensory capabilities - sight, pressure-detection (eg sitting on seat, back pressed against seat) - your brain assimilates a highly complex \u2018map\u2019 of where you are and where you are going",

The motion sensing part of the inner is composed of the semi-circular canals, otoliths, (ear-stones) and hair cells that sense the motion of the fluid.  In BPPV the otoliths get out of position and the motion sensing gets completely out of whack.\n\nWhen this happens I can get motion sickness sitting up in bed or even turning my head to look at the clock.  There are \"maneuvers\" for moving the otoliths back into the correct place, and I've used them successfully.  Look up BPPV and you'll see references to them.  Last time it happened a few weeks ago I used the \"Foster Maneuver\" to correct it.",

A perfect example of this is how spatial  disorientation can occur in pilots flying in low visibility conditions. If you're flying through cloud and can't see anything out your window then the plane pitching up might feel exactly the same as the plane speeding up. Turns may not be detected as such too. Before flying in these conditions, pilots actually have to go through training in which they learn to trust the plane's instrumentation over their own sensations of motion.",

If one out of the two agree and your brain gets it, np. If your brain doesn't or both disagree then you get a motion sickness.",

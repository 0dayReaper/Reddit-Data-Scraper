Costs vary due to differing curriculum, activities and policy.\n* The state.  Costs vary significantly for everything in different states here.\n* The region.  In the same state, the costs can vary depending on the socio-economic status of the area the school is in.",

Uniforms for sports that are technically extra curricular?\n\nYour questions has a lot of potential answers and varies wildly from school to school. \n\nMany schools don't offer as many opportunities for field trips and others have to pay more due to high cost of living areas. Its a very complex question, especially considering you don't have to send your kid on the field trip.",

I strongly feel that property taxes should be scaled by how many children you have in grades K-12.   We had/have/will have zero.",

How about play golf on a public golf course?\n\nJust because you do not use one of the many different public services does not mean that you should be able to selfishly omit paying the tax that keeps society sane.",

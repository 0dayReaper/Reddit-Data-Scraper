            "comment": "[The Archean specifically is defined chronometrically rather than stratiographically](https://stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2013-01.pdf). Basically, geologists (via the International Commission on Stratigraphy) picked two absolute dates and said \"everything from 4 billion to 2.5 billion years ago is defined as the Archean.\" And this applies to the Archean's relatively even subdivisons into 300 or 400 million year intervals...it was really just arbitrary.\n\nThe first two eras of the Proterozoic are also chronometrically defined and fairly evenly divided. The third era (the Neoproterozoic) is where we start to break from this chronometric dating pattern. The Tonian starts out as another relatively even chronometrically division, but its ending (while still formally *defined* chronometrically) is intended to be roughly when evidence of widespread glaciation appears in the geologic record. This gives way to the aptly named \"Cryogenian\", the second division of the Neoproterozoic...[still defined by chronometric dating, but intended to represent the \"snowball earth\" period of Earth's history](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/79519052.pdf). After the glaciers retreated and the planet warmed, [the Ediacaran reflects the first widespread appearance of multicellular life](https://stratigraphy.org/gssps/files/ediacaran.pdf).\n\nAnd the Ediacaran ends, of course, where the Paleozoic's Cambrian period begins....which like the Ediacaran before it, was *also* intended to reflect the appearance of multicellular life, as [the Cambrian was the first (then) known appearance of trilobites in the fossil record](https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/10.1144/SP448.10).\n\nSo both the Ediacaran *and* the Cambrian were periods created to represent the emergence of multicellular life, but the Ediacaran benefits from a much fuller understanding of the global fossil record than we had when defining the Cambrian.",

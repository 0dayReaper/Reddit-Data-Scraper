            "comment": "Citizen scientists and meteorologists would put up rain gauges. Design hasn\u2019t changed much. River levels were also used. \n\nCheck out the National Weather Service Spotters program. They train citizens to report weather back to the NWS. Because human eyes are still the best information. Those of us with amateur radio licenses also do SkyWARN.",

            "comment": "Nowadays there are 119 national weather service offices in the country, each has a 10 inch rain gauge with a funnel leading to a 1 inch gauge that\u2019s checked at least daily. Those are entered into a climate product twice a day. When it snows the snow is brought inside the office and hot water is poured in to melt the snow, the displacement is measured and that value is recorded for the liquid precipitation for the period. This is averaged over the years to find about how much each station gets per year",

            "comment": "The answer will depend a bit on the details, but we can consider a useful natural example from [Surtsey Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surtsey), an island off Iceland that first emerged from the ocean in 1963 and has been studied for this exact question, i.e., how does life colonize a new volcanic island. The introduction to [Sigurdsson &amp; Magnusson, 2010](https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/7/883/2010/bg-7-883-2010.pdf) provides a nice timeline of events. I'll refer interested readers to that paper (and the relevant references), but some highlights to get at a rough chronology:\n\n* 1963 - Island first emerges, eruption continues for 3 years. \n* 1965 - First vascular plant found along the beach, while eruption is ongoing\n* 1968 - First moss found\n* 1970 - First lichen found\n* 1971 - First fungus found\n* 1986 - Gulls establish a small breeding colony\n* 2003 - Population of gulls is ~300 breeding pairs, vascular plant proliferation grew in tandem with gull population\n* 2008 - &gt;60 different species of vascular plants live on the island\n\nThe main point of the Sigurdsson &amp; Magnusson paper is the importance of the gulls (and seabirds more broadly) in the vegetation patterns, specifically by the birds providing abundant quantities of a limiting nutrient (nitrogen) that allows plant communities to flourish where the birds live. This echoes other work highlighting the importance of marine birds in vegetation development on islands, from the introduction of nutrients like at Surtsey, but also through seed delivery and dispersal (e.g., [Ellis, 2005](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11258-005-7147-y)).\n\nIn terms of delivery of other organisms (and to some extent, the original colonizing plants), birds again can play a role, but there are a variety of other mechanisms. As described in a variety of literature (e.g., [Measey et al., 2006](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01589.x), [Garcia-Oliveras et al., 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jbi.12961), [Santos et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018221004405) and references therein, etc.) animals and seeds/plants can be delivered to islands by \"normal\" wind dispersal, storm events, rafting (i.e., things floating there on debris, kelp mats, etc), and even by large landslides. The timescales for these processes are going to vary widely (and depend on things like proximity of the island to other, already colonized islands, or large landmasses, among other things), so it's a bit hard to pin down a single characteristic timescale for the colonization by organisms, but suffice to say, it can be pretty short in many cases.",

It formed, with a few others, about 125 years ago, is heavily wooded and has a pretty wide range of wildlife, including some pretty big lizards.\n\nAs a complete non-expert, there was absolutely nothing about it that I could see, except possibly the volcanic warm mud-pools, to suggest that it is, geologically speaking, extremely young. Probably helps that it is only about 6 miles from the nearest point on the mainland, so not far for seeds to need to blow.\n\nCompletely irrelevant to the post, but there was a barman at the hotel there who was the spitting image of Prince Harry...",

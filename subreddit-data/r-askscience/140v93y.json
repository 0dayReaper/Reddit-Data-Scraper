    "postText": "I\u2019m curious if there is an evolutionary analogy to piranhas, but for the oceans.  \nI know piranhas are not mindless buzzsaw fish that kill everything in their path. But the cliche feeding frenzy school is something they actually do from time to time. This behaviour means they can tackle large live prey and large pieces of carrion.  \nSo, is there a kind of ocean fish that is similar to piranhas in this respect? A small, schooling fish that has sharp teeth and engages in feeding frenzy behaviour in large numbers.  \nNote: This question specifically excludes sharks as they are large and, even though they sometimes form groups, are not a schooling fish. This question is specifically about little guys in large numbers that tackle large prey en masse.",

            "comment": "Feeding frenzy cliche is fake. It started from a show that locals put on for a visiting westerners, by starving captive fish and giving them a dead cow. And then perpetuated by movies. You could get same frenzy from other fish, but throwing a loaf of bread into their tank. \n\nIRL, piranha stay in groups for safety from predators, and prefer to calmly rummage for small morsels of food. Attacks on living prey are rare, and typically require prey to be nearly dead. \n\nhttps://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/14-fun-facts-about-piranhas-180951948/\n\nIn oceans, tuna are perhaps the most famous for being predators and forming schools. They go after smaller prey (in sufficiently large schools), e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzZhSl_00pI",

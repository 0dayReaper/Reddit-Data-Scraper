            "comment": "True bipedalism is pretty rare.  Frankly, toddling around half-unbalanced is a good way to get eaten in the wild.  \n  \nIn all seriousness, in a tetrapod body plan (four limbs), to get bipedalism, one needs an adaptive change for the other two limbs.  If the two front limbs aren't doing anything useful, generally speaking, evolution favors keeping four legs, rather than withering perfectly useful limbs.  Obviously, that's a generalized statement, but let's talk about specialized forelimbs.  \n  \nIn humans, they are for fine manipulation.  This is also true in all the great apes, bears, raccoons, otters, and the like.  Hominins are the only ones, apparently, to get full bipedalism for this reason, and that is likely because we were the only ones with the right evolutionary pressure.  \n  \nIn badgers and pangolins, it's digging.  (Badgers have only partial bipedalism.)  \n  \nIn birds, it's flight.  (Yeah, all birds are bipedal!)  \n  \nIn penguins, their wings adapted for swimming control.  \n  \nFor other flightless birds (emus, cassowaries, etc.), current thinking is that they first evolved flight, then evolved to no longer have flight (say, when evolutionary pressures and genetic happenstance favored them being big enough to fight back, instead of flying away).  \n  \nNow, imagine the evolutionary pressures that led to snakes losing all four limbs!  \n  \nSo, basically, the four-legged form just needs a genetic mutation and a complementary evolutionary pressure to encourage bipedalism, and there just aren't very many reasons to pressure for full bipedalism.",

They already had an effective mode of locomotion for their environment that could develop and become more refined.\n\nOur most direct ancestors were tree dwellers, with hands for hands and hands for feet, with hands *and* feet that were both built for gripping branches, and shoulders and hips that were both built for climbing and swinging.  So as our ancestor's environment became less tree-dense, we came from a very different starting point that animals that were already quadrupeds.\n\nFor whatever reason, it was more advantageous for our ancestors to develop bipedalism rather than returning to being quadrupeds.  There are lots of factors here, and we don't know all of them.  One very likely factor is that, we already had limbs adapted for grabbing stuff, and having two limbs free for holding and carrying things has proven to be extremely advantageous for us.",

There are some great theories out there by evolutionary biologists. \n\nSo the idea is that we adapted a long time into trees, then the trees receded, and we adapted to the ground. \n\nNow that we had gripping hands, and feet that could walk us places, we started being able to shape our environment and our tools, which led to greater intelligence. \n\nCombine all of that, leads to us spreading out. Humans that went borth to Europe adapted to the lack of sunlight evolved. The humans that went on to asia evolved differently, to their climate, and they were the ones that were the ones that kept migrating, until they got to the americas (land bridge from russia to alaska that was exposed when ocean water receded into the ice caps - ocean water evaporates, clouds flow over the continents, it snows/rains, that precipitation turns to ice and stays as ice, ie a glacier, thus leading to the exposed land bridge). There they kept migrating south. The evidence for this is found in similarities that asians and native americans share genetically. \n\nTL;DR\nWe evolved in trees, trees stopped growing where we were, we evolved for the ground, ground got dry, we evolved to travel. We traveled far while the oceans were low. Go humans!!",

This means the opening which baby\u2019s pass through during childbirth is smaller than in 4-legged animals where the legs connect at an angle to the pelvis. In order to fit the baby through the narrower passage, we evolved to give birth earlier when the baby is smaller. See, most mammals have a similar gestation period relevant to their life span. The human gestation period should be around 14 months. So that\u2019s why newborn babies are such helpless potatoes when they\u2019re born at 9 months.\n\n\nEdit: I kept saying tailbone when I meant pelvis.",

So maybe bipedalism is not something we evolved for any particular reason, maybe it was just how we started out as a byproduct to how we moved in the trees, and when we started living on the ground more we had to work with it.",

            "comment": "It's less about adaptive value or not and more about body plan.  \n\nYour basic tetrapod body plan is pretty lizard-like (in turn, it's _very_ basically a fish with four legs stuck on).  The key thing about this body plan is that the main axis is horizontal.  Makes sense, after all the ground is horizontal and that's what you are moving across.  \n\nMost tetrapods, heck, most _vertebrates_ keep this basic orientation (for exceptions, see seahorses).  Swimming, flying, walking, the body tends to be held horizontally.  And this goes for bipedal movement too, which is actually pretty common.  If the hind legs are longer than the front legs, and the animals has a big tail (like most tetrapods), it's pretty easy to get up on two legs.  Tends to happen in lizards when they run, they are essentially just popping wheelies.  Loads of dinosaurs also went around on two legs, with the body horizontal and the tail out behind for balance.\n\nBut this doesn't really work with most mammals, which tend to have piddly little tails and long front limbs.  Which is why you rarely see any sort of bipedal mammal.\n\nNow like I said, most vertebrates go around horizontally.  What's an exception?  Stuff in trees.  Climbing, hanging from branches, that often puts the body vertical.  And requires good balance too.  Various primates will go vertical and even bipedal in trees, running along branches and doing that sort of thing, or swinging and leaping around upright. \n\nWhen we get to apes, you have no tail at all, so there's no hope of going around horizontal-bipedal like a _normal_ tetrapod.  But Gibbons like to spring around in trees, run along branches, and walk upright quite a bit when forced onto the ground.  Apes that spend less time in trees need to get around more efficiently.  Chimps and gorillas seem to have adopted knuckle walking, hominids seem to have improved the original upright stance for efficient use on the ground.  \n\nBut it's only the odd confluence of lack of a significant tail and preexisting history of upright orientation that makes upright movement plausible in hominids.\n\n\n\nAs for penguins, you'll note they also lack significant tails and (unlike most birds) have the feet at the very rear of the body to improve swimming efficiency.  Which also leaves them stuck with no other options.",

See also [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithischia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornithischia)\n\n&gt;Ornithischia (/\u02cc\u0254\u02d0rn\u0259\u02c8\u03b8\u026aski.\u0259/) is an extinct order of mainly herbivorous dinosaurs characterized by a pelvic structure superficially similar to that of birds.\n\nThe key word here being \"superficially\".\n\n&gt;However, birds are only distantly related to this group as birds are theropod dinosaurs.\\[3\\] Ornithischians with well known anatomical adaptations include the ceratopsians or \"horn-faced\" dinosaurs (e.g. Triceratops), the pachycephalosaurs or \"thick-headed\" dinosaurs, the armored dinosaurs (Thyreophora) such as stegosaurs and ankylosaurs, and the ornithopods.\n\nOnly the last of those was bipedal. And of course all of these bipeds had quadrupedal ancestors--we're all tetrapods.",

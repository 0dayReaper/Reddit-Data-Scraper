            "comment": "The main bones which fuse together are in the Cranium, legs and arms. The process is called Ossification, where cartilage between bones hardens and turns into bone.\nThe cranial bones not yet fused are joined by fibrous membranes called fontanelles which are the soft spots in baby\u2019s heads. This flexibility allows the brain to grow and develop before the bones fuse together to form one structure",

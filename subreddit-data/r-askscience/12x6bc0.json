The is a town in Africa where the rate is very high.  The vast majority of twins are born this way (fraternal).\n\nTrue Identical twins, (mono-zygotic  ie genetically the same, not necessary looking the same ) are equally rare all over the world, we still don't know why the early stage fetus splits in these cases but the rate of it happening seems fairly consistent all over. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis excludes twins due to IV (in-vitro) and some other fertility treatments, which can artificially result in twins.",

Essentially, these two people are as close to biologically identical as two people can be, so (in normal medical research) if one of them gets sick, you have a healthy version of them to observe. You might be able to look at other vitals and stats to see if perhaps there are other symptoms or hidden conditions that reveal themselves when compared to the healthy twin.\n\nMengele was probably a psychopath, but nevertheless a doctor, and so he took pride in being able to torture one twin in some hideous way while being able to compare them to their healthy sibling. He didn\u2019t just want to torture someone to death, he wanted a healthy example of that same person so that when he dissected them side by side, he could compare them directly to one another and see the results of the torture.",

With fraternal twins, each baby has its own placenta and amniotic sac. Depending on how early the embryos split for identical twins, they could share neither, just the placenta, or both. The more they share the higher likelihood of complications. To the point where if everything is shared, the pregnant person will go to hospital around week 26-28 for observation until the twins are delivered, usually by 34 weeks.",

There are a few places with high rates of monozygotic twinning, such as Candido Godoi in Brazil. There are also studies that have identified specific genetic determinants of monozygotic twinning in humans. This is actually on line with frequent reports of twins running in families. Most of these genetic determinants seem to be associated with the signaling pathways associated with formation of the first embryonic axis, or in controlling cell proliferation in the early embryo.\n\nThere are also mammal species with natural monozygotic twinning, such as armadillos, which produce monozygotic quadruplets. So, clearly there are genetic determinants that can lead some populations or even species to have high rates of twinning.",

Wenk, et al., found three cases in 39,000 records of a paternity-test database and showed a frequency of 2.4% heteropaternal superfecundation among dizygotic twins whose parents were involved in paternity disputes 5,6.

Letrozole (LE), a specific aromatase inhibitor, was first administered by Mitwally and Casper (4) to women with PCOS who were resistant to clomiphene citrate (CC). LE could prevent the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary axis from receiving estrogen-negative feedback by inhibiting estrogen biosynthesis, thus increasing follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) production and promoting follicle growth (1, 2, 3). Recently, LE gradually has replaced CC as the first-line ovulation induction agent administered to women with PCOS owing to the high rates of live birth and pregnancy (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\u201d\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0015028222014352\n\nNatural aromatise inhibitors that could impact second ova release rates, oestrogen feedback loops\n\n\u201cNatural products that have been used traditionally for nutritional or medicinal purposes (e.g., botanical dietary supplements) may also afford AIs (aromatise inhibitors) with reduced side effects.

If you look at the study I posted, they cite several key factors that could be better explained as driving forces behind the increase in twin births. And Mengele was on the run from Nazi hunters, so he really didn't have the liberty to pick and choose where to live.",

Is there possible for a pair of twins to be 100% the same? I know there\u2019s something called identical twins, but I\u2019ve always heard that they have a little bit a slight difference, but is it possible for two siblings to be 100% the same looks wise voice and everything?",

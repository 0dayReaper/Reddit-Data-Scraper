    "postText": "Is it possible that beyond the cosmic microwave background, the universe extends much further and is filled with even more matter? Could it be that this matter, due to gravitational forces, is responsible for the expansion of the visible universe within the cosmic microwave background?\n\nAre there any theories that have dealt with or considered this idea?",

            "comment": "The CMBR is a relic from the past. The surface of last scattering that emitted it doesn't exist anymore. We see it because light takes time to travel, so when we look far away, we will inevitably see it because it is an opaque plasma that lies at a specific time in the age of the universe. But that CMBR we are seeing has long since become galaxies and solar systems and planets. It's in the past of every part of the universe. What's \"beyond\" it is the time between recombination and the big bang, about 400,000 years worth of development of the universe that we can't see with electromagnetic evidence because the plasma was opaque during that time. \n\nIt only looks like a \"shell\" around us because the speed of light is the same in every direction. It's a barrier of time, not space.",

Rather than the several hundred thousand years after the big bang when microwave background radiation was emitted, this neutrino background can get us to seconds. It's not been observed but is theorized to exist due to the extremely low energy of these neutrinos and how hard neutrinos already are to detect.",

They were high energy when they were emitted, but they aren't any more.",

Like, an event that produced neutrinos would produce an amount according to the energy release but I guess you could give off 10 high energy neutrinos or 100 low energy ones?  What decides whether 1 neutrino is made or two with half the energy?",

The oval image we're given is meant to wrap around you/me/the viewer as a sphere showing where light broke out at points equidistant from us (the WISE probe that did the imaging, to be specific).\n\nWhen the light did break out, it was very high-energy stuff that has faded in energy intensity to just above Absolute Zero as the universe has expanded.  At the point of the break-out, the material that made up us/the Solar system would have been in the center of the image.  \n\nTo get a proper sense of how to 'see' the image you have to imagine a fishbowl over your head with the CMB image painted onto it, then mentally expand that sphere out to the size of the universe.  You've always been at the middle, you will always be in the middle.",

Day length (\"photoperiod\" in the scientific literature) is the big one, but temperature (\"vernalization\"), amount of light (as opposed to duration of light), and amount of water or nutrients are also signals that some plants use to decide when to flower or other seasonal changes.",

Imagine you would have to do sports wearing a winter coat that you can't take off, it would probably suck after you're warmed up, right?\n\nHorses aren't people, but if they exercise in winter coat they too get wayy more sweaty and potentially they'll be unconfortable and soaking in sweat by the time they're done exercising. Which then takes a long time to dry, during which time you need to now ensure the horse doesn't get too cold because the poor thing is wet and it's winter.\n\nAn alternative solution (used often) is (partially) shaving the horse by the way. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages.",

Some effects probably do rely on accumulation, but the actual signalling molecule only takes a few minutes of light to become active and a much longer time of darkness(or shorter time of far-red light exposure) to become inactive. \n\nIf you mean to imply that you cannot interrupt a period of darkness with a few minutes of light to make plants do things associated with shorter nights, then you are indeed remembering incorrectly. Experiments have been done and brief exposure each night is enough to influence whether plants flower or not.",

Lights are kept on something like a 20 hour on, 4 hour off schedule during their vegetative growth stages. When it is time for the plants to flower and produce fruit, the light cycle is changed to less light in a 24 hour period to mimic the shortening of the day in the harvest seasons.\n\nIt varies from plant to plant, and several other factors can determine when a plant enters a flowering stage, even the spectrum of the light, but the amount of light received is the primary factor for most plants.",

Once the rolling average reaches a certain threshold, the plant has an idea of season change and reacts.\n\nThe plant weighs both the photoperiod (On December 21st the days start getting longer until June 21st. Then they start getting shorter). This is like the 'switch'.\n\nIn other words, from Dec 22nd to June 21st, plants are in the grow mode with the inclining average daily temp stipulating the safe time to bud out without frost killing them. (The plant isn't perfect though). From June 22nd to Dec 21st, the days get shorter. The plant is getting as much sun as it can while reclaiming as many nutrients from the leaves as possible before they freeze. The average daily temp is declining here.\n\nHope that makes sense for how the two mechanisms interact!\n\nIn general, temperature affects plants in many ways.  They might require vernalization to flower well (X cold Temps for X time), affects the bitterness of vegetables and leafy greens(parsnips/lettuce/cole crops), leaf curling for cold protection(viburnum).... lots of really interesting reasons and mechanisms involved.",

            "comment": "Also the standard deviation of the soil temperature is smaller - I wrote a publication about the connection between different temperatures and the starting date of the flowering period of the black locust and the best one was the soil temperature and probably because it won't change as easily as air temperature. Also the photoperiod, the different chemicals in the soil, etc can help the plants know where theynare. I also assume that they have a yearly period at least on 4 seasoned sites which they have written in their dna and even if extent things like rain, temperature etc can manipulate these things they will occur regardlessly but maybe at a later date.",

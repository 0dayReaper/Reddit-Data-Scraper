When questioned, she claimed the cat did it. Not enough intelligence to understand that the cat couldn't have physically done it (and the humans would know that) but enough to attempt deception to avoid consequences.\n\nOther forms of deception in the animal world are very common place but the above case is a great example of  untrue statements in an attempt to decieve.\n\nI think communication is a necessary component to \"lying\". Without explicit communication it can be a bit grey in terms of whether it's lying/misrepresenting/deception etc.",

Absolutely, but think about what the gorilla has to understand to \u201cblame the cat.\u201d \n\nTo \u201cblame the cat\u201d, the gorilla has to understand: \n\n1.) ripping out the sink was a no no \n2.) that humans will be looking for a culprit \n3.) that if the gorilla is a culprit, they\u2019ll be punished\n4,) that if they blame someone else\u2019s they\u2019ll avoid punishment and \n5.) for that to work, they need a credible alibi. \n\nYou cannot convince me that the sign language this gorilla was taught allows the gorilla to understand, process, and develop a response to all of the above. \n\nWhy did the gorilla say the cat did it? We don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s plausible the Gorilla deduced ripping out the sink was a no no, but maybe not much beyond that. Were some ape able to understand crime, punishment, evidence and alibis, I\u2019d think the first go to would be the shaggy defense. In fact, I\u2019d posit the shaggy defense is the oldest defense in the history of crime, but not quite within reach for a Gorilla. \n\nI could also be 100% wrong about this. But from what I\u2019ve researched as a casual fan of science, most people seem to conclude that Gorillas use sign language only to communicate basic things like hunger, thirst, preferences between food/toys, stress or danger, and that while they maybe sort of understand the signing is a form of communication, they really aren\u2019t too concerned about it beyond \u201chey if I do this thing with my hand the bald monke will give me walnuts and if I do this other thing they\u2019ll give me a mango\u201d\n\nEdit: ICYDK the shaggy defense is \u201cwasn\u2019t me\u201d even though it was obviously you",

I go to door, and Dogs A and B stand ready to exit. Both dogs know the rule: \"Do not take your bone outside. Please drop it and retrieve it when you come back.\" So, Dog A obediently drops bone. Both exit, but B immediately spins around, rushes inside, and grabs the bone before A knows what's happening. I cannot tell you how many times I've seen different dogs play this same trick.",

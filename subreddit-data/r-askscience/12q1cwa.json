            "comment": "The Siberian Traps are a [flood basalt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_basalt). Flood basalts generally erupt effusively as opposed to explosively, where the latter is necessary to inject aerosols high enough into the atmosphere to cause global cooling. Instead, flood basalts release a fair amount of CO2, which can contribute to global warming.\n\nIn the specific case of the Siberian Traps, it was not just that they erupted and released CO2 from the exsolution of gas within the lava, but also that they erupted through a large succession of very organic rich layer of rocks. The resulting contact metamorphism of these rocks released *a lot* of additional CO2, CH4, and a variety of other greenhouse gases that led to the extreme global warming at the P-T boundary (e.g., [Svensen et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X08007292), [Ogden &amp; Sleep, 2011](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1118675109), [Black et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X11007151), [Grasby et al., 2011](https://www.nature.com/articles/ngeo1069), [Iacono-Merciano et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X1200547X), [Kui &amp; Cump, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012825214000750), [Burgess et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00083-9), etc.)",

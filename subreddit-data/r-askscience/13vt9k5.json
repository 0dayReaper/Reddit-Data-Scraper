            "comment": "There are three general ways prion diseases come about. Some people have a genetic mutation that results in prions being produced rather than normal version. They will eventually develop disease later in life, the type dependent on the mutation. Sporadic is believed to be someone who does not have that genetic background but somewhere along in their life a protein misfolds somehow creating a prion out of a normal protein. Usually happens  later in life, there is some ideas on how this might come about but we don't know for sure. The third way (variant) is ingesting or otherwise having prions introduced into your body. The most common is the sporadic form, followed by genetic then by variant. That said it is a pretty rare disease only happening in one in a million people.",

You know how repeated cannibalism can cause prion diseases right? So if there's prions that are simply extremely slow at replicating we might not notice them. But if we started eating each other, someone who's had it for 50 years could infect a 10 year old cannibal. That person goes another 50 years, and there would be an expected exponential growth. If it's slow enough, it could take generations for the levels to get high enough. \n\nBasically if we don't keep eating each other it's unlikely to find many more, especially thousands.",

However all the prion proteins have a similar misfolding that causes the problem. So there is not many different ways for misfolding that results in prions, it is one particular way it misfollds that makes it a prion. But at the end of the day, the different conditions it can cause vary a bit but all involve the basic neurodegneration regardless in humans and ultimate death. Kuru and CJD both come from the same prion protein.",

            "comment": "Source: I was involved in some of this research.\n\nThe answers given are correct in that they can transmit differently and some are genetic. But the key is the shape of the aggregates leads to the disease itself.\n\nFor instance: prion aggregate shape X can cause CJD. But if it misfolds into shape Y it can cause a different pattern of cell loss in different places (subtypes of CJD). Rarely, fatal familial insomnia can be sporadic Aka not caused by a mutation. This is a different shape altogether. \n\nInterestingly, each of these shapes can be induced with the same protein (same amino acid building blocks). The shape itself has some variability when it misfolds, and that misfolded shape them becomes very stable.",

A small subset of these proteins can be misfolded in ways that results in a prion disease, but there isnt just one protein misfolded in one specific manner that can become a prion. So the variant just describes which specific protein misfolded in which specific manner results in a given prion.",

But could it be possible to synthesise an enzyme specifically for taking down these prions, and leaving the regulars alone, to stop the progression of CJD?",

            "comment": "Enzymes work through their active sites. Imagine a single prion protein (PrP^WT ) to be like a blob and an enzyme like a hand. The hand needs to wrap around the the blob to squish (degrade) it. The problem with prion-form prion protein (PrP^SC ) is that it forms long flat sheets by sticking to other PrP^SC molecules. Now the hand can't wrap around it. Hard to develop an enzyme that works on quaternary structures.",

The ensuing inflammation has in every clinical trial (Alzheimer\u2019s specifically) caused worsened outcomes;  including in the clinical trial that led to the FDA granting the first every Alzheimer\u2019s drug a pass. After stopping that clinical trial early due to worsened outcomes, they re-analyzed the data, parsing it out into subgroups, and then found a statistically significant improvement in a subgroup. This was circa 2020.",

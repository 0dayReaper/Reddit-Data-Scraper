            "comment": "The oldest tree fossils we have are about 385 million years old. But those trees have mixed traits, transitional between two of the three basic groups of trees (or any vascular plants) we have today: the tree-sized ferns (which reproduce by spores, not seeds, and can get up to 60 or 70 feet tall) and the gymnosperms (which produce seeds in cones, not flowers). There must have been plain ordinary tree ferns before that transition to gymnosperms began, but we don't know how long before, and we have no earlier fossils.\n\nWhen the average English-speaker sees a tree fern or the simplest &amp; oldest group of gymnosperms (cycads), (s)he probably normally thinks \"palm tree\", because tree ferns and cycads have the same overall form as palms: a single blocky or spikey trunk with little or no branching and a cluster of very large leaves/fronds at the top. For dozens of millions of years, that was the only form trees came in. The form that most people think of when they hear the word \"tree\", with copious branching and then branching again &amp; again, down to lots &amp; lots of twigs with much smaller leaves on them, which can shade the ground and cover the ground with fallen leaves, doesn't appear until about 320-300 million years ago, in the pine phylum (pines, cedars, spruces, cypresses, junipers, larches, firs, Douglas-firs, hemlocks, redwoods, and yews). Ginkgoes and angiosperms (including palm trees) would follow even later.\n\nBefore even the tree ferns &amp; cycads, up to about 470 million years ago, there was something else that you probably wouldn't think of as a tree, but it was the biggest &amp; tallest living thing at the time, and it was stuck to the ground, not an animal: Prototaxites. (The \"-es\" at the end is its own separate syllable.) It had the internal structure of a fungus but also some chemical hints of the presence of algae, so it's apparently either a giant fungus or a giant lichen (symbiosis of alga &amp; fungus). Its overall shape was usually just a simple leafless column, up to 29 feet tall, although a few specimens are branched with up to 4 or 5 tips apiece. The fossils give us no sign of exactly what was on the tips.",

Is it because of movies with dinosaurs displaying mostly these? Is it because the ferns you\u2019re talking about quickly became ferns we know today and it still has historical accuracy?",

                            "comment": "Before I address the general imagery, a couple of timeline notes...\n\n\u25baTree ferns are still around and relatively common. You've probably seen some yourself and thought of them as palm trees. Smaller ferns must be the original form from which tree ferns deviated by getting bigger, not the other way around, just because ferns are the oldest &amp; simplest vascular plants and non-vascular plants (things like algae and mosses) just can't get big.\n\n\u25baDinosaurs don't show up until about 245-230 million years ago, so the trees they lived with aren't the oldest. Our oldest tree fossils, of transitional forms from tree fern to cycad, are from roughly when land-crawling fish developed into the first amphibians, preceding dinosaurs by at least 140 million years, so just plain tree ferns (not partway to becoming gymnosperms) must be older than that. Forests of distinct &amp; diverse tree ferns, cycads, and members of the pine phylum (the group including today's pines &amp; spruces &amp; cypresses &amp; such) were the homes of the first reptiles &amp; reptile-like critters, preceding dinosaurs by at least 65 million years. Ginkgos (gymnosperms with flat soft fan-shaped leaves instead of needles) joined the forests when the biggest animals on land were still things like Dimetrodon, preceding dinosaurs by over 25 million years. And those ginkgos first show up in the fossil record looking a lot like modern ginkgos, not transitional anymore, so their actual origin must have been earlier than that. The only major tree group that wasn't here yet for the first dinosaurs is the angiosperms (flowering plants; mainly monocots &amp; dicots), and they developed along the way before the dinosaur mass extinction.\n\nNow, about the imagery of dinosaurs &amp; ferns in a bog...\n\nSwamps &amp; rainforests &amp; such were common during the age of dinosaurs, and that type of environment is a good place to find ferns, especially in a world where there's no competition from angiosperms yet. (Ferns can't produce seeds, and their spores can get dessicated easily, which is presumably why seed plants developed seeds.) So it's certainly a realistic image for a lot of dinosaurs. But there were also more arid areas, and some dinosaurs lived there too. So it's not wrong as a general rule, but has probably also been applied to some species for which it is wrong just because it's slightly simplistic. Also, a tendency to depict the dinosaurs' world as a world of swamps &amp; rainforests might have gotten exaggerated by a 19th-&amp;-early-20th-century conceptualization of the dinosaurs' world as primitive &amp; exotic combined with a 19th-&amp;-early-20th-century conceptualization of \"primitive &amp; exotic\" as implying \"tropical\" based on European cultures' experience of the colonial era.",

                            "comment": "It's too absolute, but a less extremified version works. Coal still gets produced now, but not as much as back then, and trees did decompose back then but not as fast as now.\n\nSlower decomposition matters because it gives the decomposing thing more opportunity to have its decomposition stopped along the way. If it continues, the end result is that the decomposing object eventually just gradually disappears, having been mostly either eaten or converted to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and nitrogen gas. An object can't be converted to coal if there's no object left to convert. So it has to have the gradual disappearance halted while there's still something left, and making the disappearance go slowly buys more time for that interruption to happen.\n\nTermination of the decomposition process is usually achieved by submersion in anoxic (oxygen-free) water or mud, because the organisms that do it depend on oxygen. (Notice that two of the major decomposition products are results of oxidation.) Deep bodies of water often have anoxic zones caused by lack of circulation with the surface because water's source of oxygen is air. Marine life settling in such a place becomes oil instead of coal. But under the water of a bog is another kind of anoxic environment, caused by organisms taking up all of the water's available oxygen as fast as it could be produced by plants or absorbed from the air. Some bogs even have fish that have lungs and need to come up to the surface for air. This is why well-preserved \"bog bodies\" are such a significant part of central &amp; northern European archeology. And the \"peat\" in peat bogs is old wood &amp; twigs &amp; leaves &amp; such on its way to becoming coal, and can burn if you dig it up &amp; dry it out.\n\nSo, what was happening with the forests in Carboniferous &amp; Permian times...\n\nThere was definitely more coal production back then than now. And some mycologists have found that the lineages of fungi that are the most efficient at decomposing wood seem to trace back to a bit before the end of the planet's main coal-forming period, which is what you would expect if the development of that trait in fungi was responsible for speeding up wood decay and thus reducing coal formation.\n\nBut other paleontologists &amp; such have said that that fungal development traces back too far, meaning those fungi evolved right in the middle of the major coal-forming age and the coal kept right on forming, so the fungi didn't matter much. They also point out other factors that would have created more coal-forming opportunity back then instead, such as more widespread bogs, more places with fast sediment deposition, and trees having less wood to decompose and more bark to block out decomposers.\n\nSo the scientists don't all really agree on the idea of coal formation having been boosted back then by decomposers not being very efficient at decomposing wood, but it is a serious scientific possibility that was proposed with a legitimate basis and can be seriously debated. I think most of them probably figure it was one of a handful of different contributing factors, not irrelevant but not acting alone either.",

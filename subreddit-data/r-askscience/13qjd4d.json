It is my understanding that volcanic eruptions can cause a VERY slight cooling effect on the earth because of the chemicals they shoot into the atmosphere and the amounts of them. But I\u2019m wondering about something a little more abstract. \n\nIf the surface temperature of the earth is increasing, even slightly, due to the many factors that contribute to it, would the core of the earth also be increasing in heat? If so, Is there any way to know what 1 degree Celsius increase of surface temp would equate to in terms of the core of the earths temperature rising? Or is this concept fundamentally wrong?\n\nIf it\u2019s not wrong, could an increase in the earths core temperature increase the frequency of volcanic eruptions, ultimately leading to more global \u201ccooling\u201d due to the effect of volcanic eruptions?",

If so, Is there any way to know what 1 degree Celsius increase of surface temp would equate to in terms of the core of the earths temperature rising? Or is this concept fundamentally wrong?\n\nThe last option, i.e., this is a fundamentally flawed premise because surface temperature variations (at least of the magnitude we're considering here) have no measurable effect on the internal heat of the Earth, especially by the time we're at the core (or really, even within the lithosphere). In detail, the surface temperature will have an effect on the temperature gradient at depth, but this is basically limited to the few upper tens of meters and the influence is effectively zero within a few kilometers of the surface (where the temperature at depth would generally follow the [geothermal gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_gradient)). Thus, while the current and projected changes in surface temperature from anthropogenic climate change are significantly impacting details of the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and cryosphere, it's not measurably changing anything about the internal heat of the Earth.\n\n&gt; If it\u2019s not wrong, could an increase in the earths core temperature increase the frequency of volcanic eruptions\n\nSo as established above, this mechanism does not work. There is however a suggestion that climate change might cause additional volcanism in certain circumstances. Specifically, reduction in land-based iced volumes in volcanic areas (e.g., Iceland) removes mass (locally, i.e., ice melts and flows into the ocean) which causes uplift and which can induce additional melting in existing volcanic systems and thus potentially lead to a pulse of eruptive activity (e.g., [Pagli &amp; Sigmundsson, 2008](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2008GL033510), [Tuffen, 2010](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rsta.2010.0063), [Cooper et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825217301629)). Importantly, this would only predict increases in volcanism in regions with significant existing glacial cover that is reduced through melting and so would not cause global changes in volcanism rates. \n\n&gt; ultimately leading to more global \u201ccooling\u201d due to the effect of volcanic eruptions?\n\nConsidering above, maybe, but there are many caveats and nuances. The critical bit is that it's not as though every volcanic eruption has a demonstrable cooling effect. As discussed in this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/volcanic_eruption_climate_change/), there are somewhat specific aspects of individual eruptions that can make a climate effect more or less likely (and controls the magnitude of that effect). Additionally, as discussed in [this other AskScience thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1090w5h/can_a_major_volcanic_eruption_save_us_from_global/) the interaction of cooling from a volcanic eruption in the context of anthropogenic climate change is tricky, e.g., the paper discussed there suggests that given the right conditions a large volcanic eruption could cause cooling for a bit but it would be followed by accelerated warming (i.e., after a few decades, the effect would basically average out to being the same as if there was no eruption).",

Human-made greenhouse gases have added [about 3](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing) extra watts per square meter to that.\n\nThe average amount of geothermal heat coming up from inside the earth is [0.1 watts per square meter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_gradient), including volcanoes \u2014 thousands of times smaller than sunlight, and 30 times less than human greenhouse gases.\n\nThe global sunlight shading effect caused by aerosol droplets released from a single large eruption is about [1-3 watts](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Timeseries-of-historical-annual-mean-radiative-forcing-Ft-assessed-by-Myhre-et-al_fig4_299993139) per square meter, far larger than the geothermal heating effect.\n\nThe earth\u2019s climate is dominated by heating from sunlight and thermal infrared light.  Surface processes like volcanoes only matter in that they disrupt the flow of sunlight and infrared through the atmosphere.\n\nSame is true for humans too: we disrupt climate by disturbing the natural flow of sunlight and infrared.  The direct heating from burning fuel is negligible.",

            "comment": "Something to remember is that Earths surface temperature is dictated almost exclusively by the light hitting it and the heat from that light being retained by the atmosphere to whatever degree happens to prevail in a given era. The core temperature is dictated almost exclusively by the pressure exerted on it by everything above, or so I have been led to believe. \n\n So a surface temperature increase doesn't have much influence on the core at all, as far as I can make out. \n\n Also, what you said about slight changes from volcanism is only somewhat right. The scale of a volcanic eruption is important here. Yes, a relatively minor eruption won't cause more than a slight wobble on a temperature change graph. But a massive one, the scale of Krakatoa can cause noticeable changes to weather patterns over a shortish term, or even worse, a supervolcanic eruption, has the capacity to cause years long winters, under the least ideal circumstances.",

            "comment": "There was measurable cooling after the Mount pinatubo eruption because the volcano dispersed millions of tonnes of sulfur dioxide into the upper stratosphere. The chemical formed aerosol droplets that are shiny white color. Cooling occurred because the percentage of sunlight reflected back into space rather than shining on things on the surface and atmosphere which would heat up in response. Basically volcanoes put mirrors across the top of the atmosphere",

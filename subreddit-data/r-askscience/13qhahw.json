            "comment": "The rabies symptom \"hydrophobia\" isn't literal fear of water. It is an aversion to drinking water because the throat muscles are paralyzed or at least unable to protect the airway from liquids. The coughing and choking every time they try to swallow teaches them to keep the virus laden saliva flowing out of the mouth. Like everything biologic, individuals will vary, and not all those afflicted with the virus may have every symptom.",

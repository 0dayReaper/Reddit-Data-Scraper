    "postText": "Something like how much of a chemical (lead, PFAS, acetaminophen, malathion, etc) on a daily basis, will eventually raise your risk of the associated serious health issue (neurological damage, compromised immune system, liver damage, etc.) significantly above the background level, over the course of your lifetime.\n\nBruce Ames (father of the Ames test for mutagenicity) advocated for the idea of \"Carcinogenic Potency\" in weighting health risks of different chemicals.  This takes into account both the mutagenicity and the level of exposure:  alcohol is only slightly mutagenic, but taking into account the much higher amount typically consumed, it was the the most potent carcinogen outside of smoking in his analysis.  But that's just for cancer.  \n\nNow we are considering limiting PFAS in drinking water to 4 parts per trillion.  But the FDA already allows up to 8 ppm of the pesticide, Malathion, in some foods: 6 orders of magnitude more.  Does that really reflect the difference in risk?",

Ist the amount of substance, where long term exposure during an 8 h shift is supposed NOT to have any long term effects.

TLV is just for airborne substances, and is a maximum for intermittent exposure in the workplace.  So it only indirectly gets at cumulative affects, and doesn't include substances you might consume, so there are only limited comparisons you could make.  But thanks.",

Different kinds of chronically toxic substances may have different toxic effects (cancer, neurological toxicity, lung damage, teratogenicity, etc) and these may be difficult to directly compare. Is 1 ppb of TCDD more or less toxic than 1 ppb of aflatoxin or 1 ppm of mercury? It's hard to say, since the effects are different.\n\nWhat you *might* do is convert everything to [disability-adjusted life years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability-adjusted_life_year) and then say which substances cause you to lose the most DALYs. But I'm not if sure anyone has made a list of toxins by DALY loss per gram of exposure.\n\nAnyway, OSHA publishes \"Permissible Exposure Limits\" for long-term exposure of workers to toxic substances. https://www.osha.gov/annotated-pels\n\nThis may be similar to what you're looking for.",

But like TLVs they are only for airborne contaminants.  Aflatoxin (in your example), for instance, doesn't appear in OSHA's comprehensive PEL table.  Nor does it include things like acetaminophen or PFAS, except for \"Polytetrafluoroethylene, decomposition products\" (for which it doesn't have a numerical value).\n\nNot that I expect there to be a number known for every chemical compound, but I was hoping to compare more than just airborne substances.",

(you die pretty soon of liver failure)\n\nThere is also the huge problem that common activities often Dwarf this.\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(23)00027-5/fulltext for example - obestity related disability and lost years through death exceed by around a factor of three malnutrition based ones.\n\nThese are massive effects, and it is almost impossible often to measure drug or compound effects.\n\nFor example, to detect small effects (weeks of disability over the life) you might need a trial where you fed 10K people aceitomeniphen every day ffor their life. These studies are basically never done, and the assesments that try to do things like this by looking at people taking aceitomeniphen and working out the health changes is basically meaningless as they take it for a reason.",

That exact study has been done multiple times in multiple countries.\n\n100 mg of acetaminophen daily has been proved to extend the overall lifespan of some people, and have zero effect on most people.\n\nHeart disease people take daily acetaminophen, from about age 40 or so.  Half a tablet is recommended dose, so about 100 mg.  Others take 2 tablets a day.  It's cheap, easily available, it works and stops them having heart attacks.\n\nWe don't do the study actively, we do the study passively by find people who do that unknown activity anyway.  Self-diagnosed fools, people taking meds for other things, factory workers exposed to higher levels, etc.",

And here is something you may not like to hear, but with some chemo drugs the dosing is such that a certain small percentages of the patients will die from the chemo itself. Chemo are basically poisons. You need to get the dose high enough to treat the cancer but that level in some cases is very close to toxicity. It varies from drug to drug of course but chemo is some nasty stuff which sadly is necessary. Which drug you get is based on whether it is shown to work for a particular cancer. If it is the most toxic one that has best results that is what they will recommend unless the patient refuses. In such situations there can be other drugs but they may not be as effective. So it becomes a role of the dice, take the more toxic stuff with better outcomes, or take the less toxic stuff and hope you are in the small percentage that it works better than average.

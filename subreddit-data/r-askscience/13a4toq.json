            "comment": "You should expand your conception of electricity from what happens when it flows down a wire (which involves electrons skipping along the surface of the metal). In cells, there's an electrochemical gradient across a cell membrane (due to uneven concentrations of Na+, K+, Cl-, and a few other charged species) that gives rise to an electric potential (aka potential difference) across the membrane. This potential is typically around -70 mV to -40 mV for the resting membrane potential of a neuron, but it varies for other cell types.",

This flow is called current.\n\nIons are already there but that doesnt mean we can generate electricity by connecting two ends of cell.\n\nCurrent generation is done by neurotransmitter chemicals, simply chemical that stimulate release of some ions on one side causing imbalance in ionic potential across membrane forcing ions from excess source to flow to  sink other side and this flow is what we called current/electricity.\n\nThis electricity induces chemical changes which fyrthur induce muscle tissue to ecpand or contract and thus aids in body motion\n\n\n\nHuman nervous system is like distributes system so curremt genrated is lesser in power and immefiatly distributes\n\n\nOrganisms like eel has concentracted nervous syseten where nervous elevtrocytes cell are piled together and thus when current flow overall volathe is very high. and thus eel can be used as battery but they generate shock pulses and continous and thus will damage equipments.\n\nDiffernce between human and eel is \nhuman -&gt; single battery\neel -&gt; stack of battery cells act as transformer",

            "comment": "Human cells do not directly produce electricity in the same way as a battery or an electrical generator. However, they generate electrical signals through a process called action potential, which is crucial for nerve signaling and muscle contraction.\n\nThe fundamental unit of the nervous system is the neuron. Neurons have a specialized cell membrane that contains ion channels. These ion channels control the movement of charged particles, such as ions, across the cell membrane. The distribution of ions across the membrane creates an electrical potential difference, known as the resting membrane potential.\n\nWhen a neuron is stimulated, ion channels open or close, causing a rapid change in the distribution of ions and altering the membrane potential. This shift in potential generates an electrical signal called an action potential. The action potential propagates along the neuron's membrane, allowing the transmission of information over long distances.\n\nDuring an action potential, there is a rapid influx of positively charged ions, such as sodium ions, into the neuron, followed by an efflux of positively charged ions, such as potassium ions, out of the neuron. This sequence of ion movements creates a temporary reversal of the electrical charge across the cell membrane. The magnitude and duration of the action potential can vary depending on the type of neuron and the specific physiological context.\n\nThe amount of electrical current produced by a single cell or neuron is relatively small, typically on the order of microamperes (\u03bcA) or even smaller. However, when millions or billions of neurons fire in a coordinated manner, as in the human nervous system, the collective electrical activity can give rise to significant signals and patterns that underlie our thoughts, sensations, and movements.\n\nWhile human cells generate electrical signals, the generation of electricity in the context of energy production for the body's needs primarily occurs through metabolic processes, such as the conversion of glucose and other molecules into adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through cellular respiration. This ATP is then utilized as an energy source for various cellular activities, including the maintenance of ion gradients necessary for the generation of electrical signals.",

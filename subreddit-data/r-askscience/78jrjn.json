            "comment": "Bloodsucking insects will become engorged after feeding. Mosquitos, bed bugs, lice, ticks, fleas, ticks (arachnid), are visibly larger after feeding.\n\nPerhaps more relevant is the Fat Body.\n\nInsects have an organ called the Fat Body. Lipids (fats) are stored here in adipocytes in the form of triglycerides (same way mammals store fat, essentially). These lipids are consumed during periods of high energy demand (like when flying), and are replenished in periods of food abundance. \n\nSome insects have been shown to increase the size of the Fat Body in the winter, as a mechanism to enhance survival. Other insects (like house flies) don't seem to be able to store extra fat. \n\nedited to add some sources: \n\nStudy on fat storage in Culex pipiens: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2769712/\n\nreview paper on the insect Fat Body:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3075550/",

I ask because a while back I was bitten by a mosquito that fattened itself to the point that it was unable to fly (it would comically hover up to about an inch high before falling back down), which made it a lot easier for me to smash it. Obviously, that's a bad spot to put itself into. I'd assume they know to stop before they pop themselves, but it seemed like the one that bit me took it too far. ",

                            "comment": "Some blood feeding insects (ex. mosquitoes, phlebotomine sandflies to name a few) undergo a process known as prediuresis,  in which they excrete urine as they feed in order to concentrate the blood protein (the nutrient rich part which they need) and filter our the \"junk\" (ex. water, parts of the blood that are not needed). This reduces their weight &amp; allows them (most of the time) to fly off after they have finished feeding. This allows them to retain all the nutrients they need, while maintaining a weight which allows them to fly. If you let a mosquito feed for a couple of minutes, you'll see a bunch of liquid droplets fall! It's pretty interesting, but don't try that at home - I did it in a lab where the mosquitoes were bred &amp; they were not carrying any pathogens.\n\nTo answer the question you've asked, there is a mechanism that tells them when to stop, but I don't know exactly how it works. Hopefully someone who knows something about that can comment!\n\nEdit: grammar, spelling.",

They use insulin-like peptides (ILPs) but it works similar to insulin in us, in that it can signal to send a 'full' signal to the brain. When you mess with this pathway, you can make mosquitoes take smaller or larger meals. They also have nerve cells that can sense the level of abdominal distention which also determines when they will stop feeding and can also drive them to feed again if they haven't reached 'full'.",

When only one member of the population reproduces, evolution proceeds quite differently. Most creatures evolve according to what is best for individual survival and reproduction, but ants have no evolutionary pressure to preserve the individual - a population's ability to procreate is affected only by the survival of the queen. A queen whose offspring behaved to maximize their own survival will not do as well as a queen whose offspring are expendable. Worker ants do not have the same kind of self preservation instinct that mammals do, because their evolution is guided by what is most effective at feeding and protecting the queen rather than natural selection pressuring for individual survival. A queen ant's survival strategy is essentially to have a zillion non-fertile babies who will take care of its every need and do not have offspring of their own. Because worker insects do not reproduce on their own, they evolve to benefit their queen instead of to benefit themselves. The whole colony's evolutionary path is determined by the well-being of a single organism.\n\n\nAnts, bees, and other colony insects are called eusocial animals, which means that they have evolved to prioritize the good of the population as a whole rather than the good of the individual.",

After all, it would not benefit the colony to lose workers that could survive and keep contributing to the colony's survival. Keeping workers alive is beneficial to the group.\n\n\n\nA good example of worker expendability would be the stings of honeybees. Although they can safely sting many creatures, larger animals like humans have much thicker skin than small animals. The barbs of the stinger get stuck in the skin and when the bee tries to pull the stinger out, it rips off the back end of its own abdomen and dies in a matter of minutes. In creatures that reproduced directly, being unable to use their primary defense mechanism without dying would strongly pressure evolution toward a fear response, fleeing from the danger, and only stinging small animals.\n\n\nHoneybees, however, do not behave this way. If you encounter a bee far from the hive while it's gathering nectar, it generally won't sting you unless you behave threateningly and it fears it may die anyway. However, if a large animal approaches the hive, worker bees will sting it en masse, essentially carrying out suicide attacks. In creatures that reproduce directly, natural selection would probably favor fleeing and starting a new colony over kamikaze strikes. However, from the perspective of a beehive, the death of the queen means the end of the colony. If a big scary mammal smashes the hive, the entire colony dies. Sacrificing many individuals to scare such a creature away is the best way to secure the species' reproductive future.\n\n\nAlso, expendability doesn't even necessarily mean death, either. Going back to the example farther up the chain of the honeypot ants, that's a creature which has evolved a form which would be utterly helpless to survive on its own, and serves as a living storage unit for its brethren. A non-colony animal would never develop a morphology of just being a giant sack of food like that.\n\n\nMost species are wired to maximize their own chance of surviving and reproducing. Colony insects are wired to maximize their queen's chance of surviving and reproducing. How that behavior plays out varies wildly from one species to another, but the evolution of colony insects is definitely quite different from the evolution of creatures where every member of the species is fertile.",

Keep in mind what makes a progeny of queens succesful, though - a queen's success is dependent upon the ability to give birth to offspring that do a good job taking care of her. If queen A produces offspring with a tendency to wander off on their own and queen B (pun not intended) produces offspring that will bring all the food they find back to her and sacrifice their lives to defend the queen from potential predators.... Hive A will die and hive B will survive. How successful a queen is will be determined almost entirely by the quality of workers that queen can give birth to.",

One parasite I study is a nematode that infects the aquatic larvae of mayflies. Toward the end of summer, when the nematode and mayfly life cycles are about to move to their next stage, the mayfly may have nothing left inside its exoskeleton except brain and worm. The worm at this point has stolen pretty much all possible nutrients from the mayfly without killing it, and usually takes up most of the body cavity, but the places that are not full of worm are often just hollow. I can't even see guts, let alone fat stores, under the microscope. In unparasitized mayflies, the \"abdomen\", or rear third, of the insect is mostly filled with white stuff that doesn't look unlike cotton stuffing (fat stores), plus a small tube of intestine down the center. There are also some kidney like organs that excrete dissolved waste, but they are really small.\n\nI do not know if the worm consumes the fat stores directly, or if it siphons off energy some other way, but if you imagine a hollow exoskeleton that is what you would see. If you dissect the worm out (as I have done way too many times), you are usually left with a hollow insect, especially if the worm is far along.\n\nI also study Tobacco Hornworms and their parasitic wasps. In the caterpillars, the fat is stored as white blobs that kind of looks like clots or something, between the skin and guts. When they are parasitized, the wasp larvae live between the skin and guts and the clots are absent. Again, I don't know if the cells are completely gone, or just empty and shrunk tinier than I can see, or what.\n\nEDIT: Too many apostrophes and not enough commas.\n\nEDIT2: Realized I didn't answer the question of if the exo-skeleton expands or not. While there are some soft tissues that allow the exoskeleton (or integument in science speak) to flex and expand/contract, it generally only changes size when an insect molts. When the insides shrink due to dehydration or something (and I imagine with major fat loss) they will start to pull away from the exoskeleton. Honestly though, I'm starting to think we should starve some insects and then cut them open so we really know.\n\n[PICS](https://imgur.com/a/8pZzZ)",

The mayfly transforms into a flying adult with the worm still inside it. If the mayfly is a male, the worm secretes hormones that \"femenize\" it, and make it look and act like a female. Instead of trying to mate, infected mayflies (male and female) fly back to the water to try and lay eggs. What actually happens is the worm crawls out, the mayfly dies, and then the worm lays *its* eggs.\n\nAs far as I know the explanation for why the worm bothers femenizing the males and going through the whole metamorphosis thing is to expand its ability to move from one place to another.\n\nI think you are going to have to dive into the academic literature if you want to learn more.

You are right though that this would not be \"mutualistic\" because the host does not get to pass on its genes, so the effect of parasite on host is very negative. \n\nMany ecologists, myself included, tend to think of parasitism and mutualism as a spectrum, which can shift one way or the other depending on the particular situation, and which surely often shifts from one to the other over evolutionary time.\n\nThere is an interesting debate on whether coral and it's symbiotic algae are a mutualism or a parasitism. Some people say the coral is \"farming\" the algae and that the algae have higher reproduction rates outside the coral. Others argue that survival outside the coral is much lower, so the debate is over which set of conditions are most advantageous for the algae, which honestly probably changes day to day.\n\nEDIT: Just to expand, I often think of mutualisms like buying a used car from a shady used car lot. Both sides are trying to take advantage of the other as well as they can, which in the case of mutualism balances out (you got a deal on a new ride, and the salesman made some $$). Sometimes this balance tips and one member of the mutualism becomes a parasite on the other.",

Symbiosis means \"living together\" and is a generic term for many species interactions. In common parlance it has come to be synonymous with another specific kind of symbiotic interaction: \"mutualism\".\n\nI think what you mean here is \"mutualism\", which is when two species interact closely to the benefit of both. This is definitely not a mutualism because the infected maylfies do not get to reproduce, and so we would consider that a very negative effect of the worm on the mayfly.\n\nAs an aside, there are 4 types of symbiosis (5 according to some people, but we generally teach 4 to college undergrads).\n\nParasitism +/-\n\nMutualism +/+\n\nCommensalism 0/+ (no effect of species A on B, but a positive of B on A)\n\nAmmensalism 0/- (no effect of species A on B, but a negative effect of B on A)",

But they don't change their diet/exercise, so now, instead of their arms getting much fatter, it might go to their gut for example. The question is... Do insects have a finite number of fat cells?",

They have a heart, but it is near their backs instead of near their front like ours. While our blood stays in tubes all the time, some of their blood squishes around in an open space called the hemocoel (\"blood space\"). \nInstead of using blood to move oxygen and carbon dioxide, their air tubes (which are spread around their bodies) take in oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. Blood can be different colors. Our blood is red due to hemoglobin, the stuff in our red blood cells that lets us move oxygen and carbon dioxide. Since insects don't move these gases in their blood, their blood doesn't have hemoglobin and is generally not red.",

Our blood flows very exclusively in the vascular system, barring a few specific places. \n\nInsects have a pseudo-coelom. It's called a haemocoelom I think. But net net the blood flows in the coelom and performs all the tasks our blood does except transport oxygen via haemoglobin. Instead they breathe via diffusion, where oxygen diffuses through little pores in their body. There's a technical term for these pores too but lul 12th grade was a long time ago.\n\n\nBit less jargon laden but that's about it.",

This is a kind of functional equivalent of the liver and is also used (as the name suggests) to store fat as an energy reserve.\n\nIn our experiments, we could always very clearly see the difference between fat bodies of starved vs non-starved locusts.\n\nFat isn't only stored in the fat body though. While that's the main site of storage, you can also see fat in all body cavities.\n\nThe reason why an insect doesn't get literally fat is because they are often filled with air sacs, filling the body cavities. When the organs grow (because of fat storage, production of eggs,...), these air sacs simply deflate and become smaller.\n\nFinally, there is a large difference between insects, and logically also a large difference in the time you can starve an insect. Our locusts could easily make it two weeks without any food. Several of them would make it over a month.",

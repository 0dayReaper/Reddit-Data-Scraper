            "comment": "So several people here have mentioned several of the reasons (they carry most of the same genes as humans, they reproduce quickly, and they are easy to take care of). But one reason why mice were also selected (or perfect to become a model organism), is that people used to competitively breed mice to have certain traits back in the early 1900s. \n\nSo certain breeders selected for a nice coat, cool eye color, temperament, etc, in a way similar to how dog breeds came to be. This also ensured that many colonies of mice were so inbred, that they were functionally clones of one another.\n\nWhen doing research, you essentially want to be controlling as few variables at a given time, so you can isolate why things are occurring. Because many of the mice used in an experiment are functionally clones, any differences you see between mouse groups in an experiment are likely to be from your treatment/condition/variable you introduced. And because they are clones, it\u2019s great for testing genes that you engineer into them.\n\nAnd because they were so inbred, certain strains tended to have very odd characteristics that were beneficial in science, but horrible in nature.\n\nA lot of cancer therapy/transplant research uses mice called, \u201cathymic nude\u201d, which lack the ability to make T cells (a huge component in the immune system) and lack fur. Because they lack that part of the immune system, they can be implanted with cells from other mice, or even tissue from other species. So it\u2019s very easy to graft tumors from humans onto these mice, and see how the tumor might respond to a given therapy.\n\nBut mice and rodents aren\u2019t great for everything.  They aren\u2019t great for certain diseases (for example they don\u2019t develop the same type of lesions humans do in TB research, while rabbits do), and that is why you occasionally see dogs, rabbits, pigs, flies, etc used as well.",

They are also omnivores so they are easy to maintain, they are relatively smart too. In short, if you need to run an experiment on a vertebrate then rats and mice are the best all rounders you can find.",

Other reasons include regulatory (FDA and EMA) requirements that potential new drugs be tested in at least two animal species before clinical trials in humans can begin. One of these must be a rodent species (mice or rats) and the other a non-rodent species, such as dogs (beagles in particular). Other species include rabbits, ferrets, guinea pigs, and monkeys (non-human primate), depending on the exact nature of the drug being tested. These animals are specifically bred for this purpose (e.g., Sprague-Dawley is a type of rat that's used often). These animals have been very well studied and the relationship between how they respond to, and metabolize, drugs, in comparison to humans, are well known.",

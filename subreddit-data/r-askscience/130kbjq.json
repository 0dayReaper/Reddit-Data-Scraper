They would only be able to move where moisture and  food are available.  In a high moisture environment could move relatively freely and spread rapidly.  Really depends on what germ you are talking about.",

            "comment": "Germs are not a single type of thing. It's not even a term that's really used scientifically outside of the phrase \"germ theory\". The word is more commonly used in science to refer to \"germ cells\" which are something completely different to the popular meaning of the word \"germ\". Germ cells are precursors to reproductive cells like sperm and eggs.\n\nYou're referring to pathogenic micro-organisms and the answer to your question is \"it varies\". \n\nMost pathogenic bacteria don't really move independently in a way that is meaningful in this context. There are viruses with moving \"parts\" but again not really meaningful in the way you mean. Some pathogenic protists do move independently (e.g. giardia and pathogenic amoebae). I don't know if more complex parasites like parasitic worms really fit with what we imagine when we use the word \"germ\" but they can definitely move around independently.",

What you can see is only the tip of the iceberg and the whole bread should be discarded.\n\nAlso there is some directional movement in bacteria as they posess chemoreceptors to guide their search for nutrients. Nonetheless you are right in that it would take very long to move over macroscopic scales.\n\nEdit: Actually there is also very relevant movement over larger distances: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarming\\_motility",

These fungi grow microscopic \"roots\" called hypae deep into their source of nutrients. In a later stage of their development they grow fruiting bodies on the surface. This spore producing fruiting body is what we can see with the unaided eye. Therefore once we notice a mold it has already grown deep into its substrate.",

The problem however is that these fungi grow on a gel and not on bread. I suspect that the agarose gel matrix is harder to penetrate for the mold. Also bear in mind that in contrast to your typical loaf of bread the gel surface is constantly moist and nutrients are easily accessible so the mycelium can develop right on it. So there may neither be the necessity nor the capability to grow into the gel itself.\n\nI do concede that a dense patch of mycelium without fruting bodies should already be visible, not however all the hyphae and least of cource their toxins. I refrain from calling them colonies as in contrast to unicellular colonies one circular mold probably consists of just one organism.",

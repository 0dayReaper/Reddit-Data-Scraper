            "comment": "First, technically its an allele rather than a gene. A gene codes for some aspect of the phenotype (appearance), an allele is a varient of a gene that has arising by random mutation. The same mutation can occur twice but it is unlikely, particually when the last common ancestor between two species is so long ago (its also unlikely that the allele has been inherited from the common ancestor and preserved in both species, given the time scales invovled).\n\nSecond, cat and human hair colour are not controlled by the same gene (or set of genes). One of thr key coat colour genes for cats is on the X chromosome (this been by you typically can't get tortoiseshell male cats), but as far I as know the human hair colour genes are located on different chromosomes (I deal with animal genetics rather than human).\n\nSo basically the reason that a colour might be recessive in some species but not another is that they occur due different gene and allele combiations, which means there will be different dominace interactions between alleles.",

The red alleles of *MC1R* result in a melanocortin 1 receptor protein that is relatively insensitive to alpha\u2013melanocyte-stimulating hormone, which in turn causes less eumelanin (brown/black) to be produced and more pheomelanin (reddish) to be produced.\n\nAlso, there's a wikipedia entry on the [Orange locus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_coat_genetics#Sex-linked_orange/red) on the X chromosome in cats. Unfortunately we don't know the precise gene yet, only roughly where it is.",

In humans, [uppercase for the gene name](https://www.genenames.org/about/guidelines/#:~:text=Every%20gene%20that%20we%20name%20is%20assigned%20a%20unique%20symbol%2C%20HGNC%20ID%20(in%20the%20format%20HGNC%3A%23\\)%20and%20descriptive%20name.%20Symbols%20contain%20only%20uppercase%20Latin%20letters%20and%20Arabic%20numerals%2C%20and%20punctuation%20is%20avoided%2C%20with%20an%20exception%20for%20hyphens%20in%20specific%20groups.) is the convention.  [Like this](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/gene/mc1r/). (It should have been italicized, though; my mistake. Fixed.) In [drosophila](https://wiki.flybase.org/wiki/FlyBase:Nomenclature#Policy_for_establishing_FlyBase-approved_gene_symbols_and_names) and [rodents](http://www.informatics.jax.org/mgihome/nomen/gene.shtml), gene names are generally lowercase, albeit with an initial capital in drosophila if it's named after a dominant phenotype, or in rodents for all genes.",

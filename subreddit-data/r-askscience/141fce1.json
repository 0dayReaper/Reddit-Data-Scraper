Rather is predisposes humans to middle ear infections, a condition that does not appear to exist in other primates. \n\nThe floppy character of the human eustachian tube is probably a coincidental side effect of other anatomical in the head and throat, particularly the development of speech. \n\nFrom a paper:\n\n&gt;The rhesus monkey\u2019s genome has recently been mapped,\r\nrevealing a 97.5% similarity to humans. \n\n&gt;Even though the\r\nanatomy of the eustachian tube is essentially similar in\r\nthe two species, the tube\u2019s length in the rhesus monkey is\r\ntwo thirds within bone (intrabullar) and one-third carti-\r\nlaginous (extrabullar). In the human, the order is re-\r\nversed; one third is osseous, and two thirds is cartilagi-\r\nnous. This difference implies that the rhesus tube is stiffer\r\n(less compliant) than the human tube.\n\n&gt;Indeed, we have\r\nreported that the human eustachian tube is highly com-\r\npliant (floppy), especially in infants. In a comparative\r\nstudy of eustachian tube function between the rhesus\r\nmonkey and humans, we concluded that the monkey tube\r\nis stiffer than in humans.\n\n&gt;A  floppy eustachian tube\r\nwould be more susceptible to otitis media than one that\r\nis stiff.\n\r\n&gt;Also, the morphology of the tensor veli palatini muscle is distinctly different between the two species. **In both\r\nthe monkey and in humans, this muscle has been shown to\r\nbe the only dilator of the tube during swallowing, which\r\nequilibrates middle-ear pressure with ambient pressure.**\r\nIt primarily inserts into the lateral cartilaginous lamina of\r\nthe tube. In the monkey, it attaches to the entire length of\r\nthe tubal cartilage, whereas in humans, the muscle\u2019s insertion is much shorter.\n\n\n&gt;**This difference may explain the\r\nremarkable ability of the monkey in our laboratory to\r\nequilibrate applied negative middle-ear pressure, even\r\nwhen the pressure is suddenly applied.**\n\n\n&gt;By contrast, we\r\nhumans (some more than others) have difficulty equilibrating applied middle-ear negative pressure, especially\r\nwhen the negative pressure within the middle ear is suddenly applied, such as during descent in an airplane or\r\nwhen scuba diving\n\n\r\n&gt;Flisberg et al. in studies using a pressure chamber,\r\ndescribed the \u201clocking\u201d mechanism of the eustachian tube\r\nin healthy human volunteers; when middle-ear negative\r\npressure between \u000130 and 50 mm Hg was applied in the\r\nchamber, the tube locked, and the subjects could not open\r\nit by swallowing. \n\n&gt;In a recent comparison study of eustachian tube function between the monkey and humans in\r\nour laboratory, the duration of tubal dilation (i.e., opening) was more efficient in the monkey than in the human,\r\nwhich can be attributed to the comparative anatomic differ-\r\nences (described above) between the two species.\n\ndoi: 10.1097/MLG.0b013e31815ddaa0",

The difference in meaning matters. Our lungs collapse without a problem every few seconds, but we evolved to allow extreme changes in shape and tension.   \n\n\nWhales do have air in their ears, as I only learned about from online sources. Air *surrounds* the middle ear, but there is no long ear canal like in humans connecting the middle to an outside ear drum. Instead, sound is conducted to the middle ear by fatty tissue next to the jaw bone. However, regardless of the rigidity of the parts of whale ears, the air-filled parts of the ears are likely to change shape as some whales diver over 2,000 meters deep.  Of course, regardless of how much the whale ear changes shape, it will simply have evolved to tolerate that change.",

I have a standing 6 month appointment for wax removal since the shape inside my ear lends to not draining properly and impaction on my eardrum.\n\nI haven't been scuba diving in some years but I can go, but as I say it's a time consuming PITA to equalize. It's even obnoxious on airplanes.",

            "comment": "Simple answer is that their breathing and equalization techniques are made for that type of stress. As humans we utilize the valsava maneuver more so then the Toynbee maneuver. The Toynbee maneuver allows you to massage your jaw, swallow a certain way, or move your throat to allow air from the lungs into your other air cavities. Essentially some people and most marine mammals have the ability to adjust pressure equalization by moving their jaw or adjusting their ear canals in a way that isn\u2019t forced air from the lunges to even put pressure \n\nEven so mammals are not immune to decompression related injuries like embolisms and reverse blocks. There is on going research going on looking into decompression injuries in some of the deepest diving mammals to understand more on how that is affecting them. In the past we thought them to be immune as we only associated such injuries as being compressed air driven. \n\nHope that helps! Most of these types of questions your dive instructor should be able to answer! I remember when I became an instructor most of the time was answering these types of questions, helped me with getting my degree in marine bio tbh lol",

This is sort of a metric for taste, however, different animals may have specialised taste buds. Take dogs for example, they have specialised taste buds for tasting water, while humans don't. Therefore, animals may taste things differently to humans, so it's not really a direct comparison when talking about other species.",

Smell and taste are very closely related, and dogs can actually taste foods through their sense of smell with a special organ along the dog\u2019s palate. To exemplify this point, you can note that while dogs can differentiate between meat-based and non-meat-based foods without smell, they cannot differentiate between chicken, beef, fish, or pork without smell. While humans don\u2019t have the ability to taste smell in this sense, we have more tastebuds to encourage or discourage our food choices depending...\n\nTo read up more: https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/can-dogs-taste/",

The weird smell that emerges during a light downpour for example, is called petrichor and it is aerosolized soil particles produced when raindrops hit dry soil. We can smell it at 0.4 parts per billion, or 0.00000004%. \n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective it\u2019s easy to see why we are so sensitive to it. Dry soil means prolonged dry spells, which usually means scarcity of water. Therefore humans evolved to detect when it rains as soon as possible. This would have been very frequent as well, since humans evolved in hot and dry Africa.",

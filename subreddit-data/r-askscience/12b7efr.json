            "comment": "Recently flipped icebergs are blue because ice is blue, and it isn't scattering light.\n\nThe blue shade in ice is because ice absorbs light much more strongly at wavelengths other than blue; light will travel about 100 fold further through ice at 400 nm wavelength (blue) versus 700 nm (red). See Fig 3 [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://atmos.uw.edu/~sgw/PAPERS/2019_PCIce.pdf&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwis5LTjnJD-AhXgXWwGHXVFCEoQFnoECAIQAg&amp;usg=AOvVaw1cH0afNFqZ6zEip3e7-PTw) for a rough plot of the absorption spectra. Therefore, if white light is shining through a big block of ice, you'll see more of the blue light make it through unaffected than the yellow, green, red, etc light, and the end result will be blue.\n\nNow, you might notice that snow is made from ice crystals, but it isn't blue. The reason for that is light scatters off interfaces. Snow has lots of air/ice interfaces. The scattering off those interfaces is much less sensitive to wavelength than the absorption is, so the scattered light is much more even across the spectrum. In simple words, white light in will scatter evenly, and you'll get white light out.\n\nWhy does this matter for icebergs? Two reasons: first, the ice has relatively few airbubbles in it, it's been compacted down heavily. If you pull out an ice cube from your freezer, you'll notice cracks and bubbles. Those can scatter that light, and make it appear white. Under the crushing weight of the glacier, however, the ice has been forced in as tight as it can go, and a lot of those bubbles and cracks have been forced out of the ice. So, there's fewer things to scatter off, and the ice will be less white. Note, however, that things can be entrained in the ice to change its colour. The link above discusses a few in a section a page or two past Fig 3.\n\nThe second reason it matters, is that water melts stuff, and melting smooths things. If you look at the top of an iceberg, it's white. It's covered in snow, yes, but also the ice surface is rougher. There's lots of little facets and such that again scatter light heavily, and make things white. However, when you stick it in water, that changes. Now, the water around the iceberg isn't necessarily hugely warmer. Indeed, it may actually be below the freezing point of pure water (since salt in the water depresses freezing points, which is why people salt roads in snowy climates incidentally). Whatever it is, though, it's going to interact with the ice surface and **smooth it out.** \n\nThat smoothing is because surfaces have some energy associated with them, and a rough surface is more surface. Physics wants to minimise potential energy, and much as a ball will roll down a hill, surfaces in dynamic systems will rearrange themselves to minimise that surface energy. You see it in liquids all the time, it's what causes surface tension. Now, I should point out it's a little more complicated than just area, and that leads into why snowflakes grow the way they do, but basically all else being equal the pointy bits of ice with lots of surface, and not much volume will be \"high energy\" and the big flat surfaces will be \"low energy\", and the water in that ice will try and move from high to low. So, over time, those pointy bits will melt and the flat surfaces will grow (or at least melt slower), making the ice flatter. \n\nSo, end result is you have a smoother surface with less defects that can scatter light. So now you can see the inherent colour of the ice better. And ice, as we've said before... Is blue.",

In bright sunlight, glaciers are almost always white.\n\nLooking deep into a glacial crevasse (or slot within a berg) will appear blue due to scattering, and a heavily crevassed glacier will take on a blue cast from a distance due to internal scattering. Same with icebergs, but they also pick up blue reflections from the water. But in bright sunlight, most smooth glaciers and bergs appear white.\n\n&gt; \u2018The white ones\u2019 vs \u2018the blue ones\u2019 - they\u2019re the same bergs, with the only difference being which areas have melted enough to scatter the light \n\nAgain, no.

You should do some research, instead of basing claims on [whatever it is you\u2019re basing them on. Because it\u2019s obviously not science]. This is a fascinating field of study, and there have been a lot of people putting time, energy, and effort into sharing scientific fact describing the reasons behind these things.

They're beautiful. Some flipped bergs are blue, as the OP asks about, due to their density, age, or morphology, but most will appear white or white with a blue tint, depending on how deep light can penetrate into the ice.",

Maybe it\u2019s in phrasing? \ud83e\udd14\n\nI wholeheartedly agree that \u201cin bright sunlight, almost all glaciers are white\u201d, but my argument is that /it is the sun exposure itself causing the surface layer of ice to melt that turns it a more white color/. You said yourself that the crevasses are deep blue. This is DUE to a lack of exposure that causes air between ice crystals to refract light and appear white. \n\nWould you agree that the blue ice seen in the picture will turn to white after a time? Would you agree then that the difference in color that comes with time is the /exposure/? If so, then how can we be disagreeing that \u2018the white ones\u2019 were, at some point, \u2018the blue ones\u2019? Unless you\u2019re referring to glacier firn (which, given your background, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree is /not/ glacial ice.) \n\nPerhaps the ice in Antarctica is different from the ice up in Alaska, somehow? \n\nI wish I could attach this picture of me, UNDER the Mendenhall glacier, where I lived and worked. It\u2019s blue because it hasn\u2019t been exposed to the sunlight, and is totally solid. Once it gets dark closed to sunlight and starts to melt, the outer portions /turn/ white. \n\nWhen you walk on the glacier on a sunny day, it\u2019s /crunchy/ because some of the ice melts faster than other areas. Good luck with traction on an overcast or rainy day \ud83d\ude13\n\nPerhaps our difference in opinion is in regards to semantics? Say you have an ocean-terminating glacier that calves. Maybe the /previously exposed/ ice that becomes an iceberg considered \u2018a white one\u2019, versus the /previously un-exposed/ ice, which you would refer to as \u2018a blue one\u2019? If this is the case, my argument is that the /glacial ice/ (not firn, or anything else), /before/ it is exposed to melting conditions /is blue/, and then only becomes white after sufficient exposure. At least, this is the case in Alaska. \n\nI am admittedly woefully ignorant of ice in Antarctica, especially compared to your extensive experience. Thank you for being willing to have civilized discourse, and I hope we can continue to learn from eachother, and tease out fundamental truths and distinctions together! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\u270c\ud83c\udffb",

Those, and similar glaciers in places like Patagonia, form in relatively warmer and wetter conditions than places like Antarctica or Greenland. The rain, melting snow, and warmer environment means that liquid water can percolate down through the firn, filling-in the air gaps, and making for a denser, more-solid glacier than you would find in colder polar regions. In my experience, Alaskan glaciers generally have a beautiful blue color even before calving, and the bergs are also bluer because of the ice clarity, whether or not they've flipped.\n\nIn comparison, the first 100 meters (est) or so of many Antarctic tidewater glaciers are generally firn or poorly compacted ice, not dense glacial ice with lots of air bubbles. These calve into white bergs, and any blue tint is often because of reflections from the water. Looking into a crevasse or fracture in one of these bergs is always a deep blue because of light scattering and absorption, but the surfaces generally reflect white.\n\nBack to the OP's question, flipped polar icebergs that are distinctly blue are either formed from dense basal ice (similar to what you'd see in Alaska), or -- more commonly -- because the underside was soaking in sea water long enough to permeate all the interstitial gaps, allowing light to penetrate deeper.",

            "comment": "The key to differential erosion (i.e., erosion at different rates, whether that's by water in a river or through hillslope processes, etc.) is typically contrasts in the erodibility of material. The most common example is contrasts between different sedimentary rock layers, this is why canyons formed in layered rocks tend to be stair-stepped, where harder, more resistant rocks tend to form steeper cliffs than the the softer, less resistant rocks. While contrasts between layers is not going to help us explain a vertical spire (or a pinnacle as it is sometimes called), differential erosion still might. Here though we need to consider that there are other aspects of rocks that can influence their erodibility besides just the rock type. One of those can be the presence of fractures, i.e., cracks, that because they can be a pathway for fluids, tend to be zones where weathering and then erosion is a bit more efficient. It's pretty common for there to be sets of cracks in rocks at the surface (e.g., [sets of joints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_%28geology%29)), so one likely possibility is that there was a set of vertical joints that were exploited and allowed for differential erosion around the \"core\" of what is now the spire. This process is also thought to be the main way that [hoodoos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoodoo_%28geology%29) form. While there might be other ways to form this pinnacle (e.g., just a remnant left behind from the way the river network was organized with the pinnacle being originally part of an \"interfluve\" that was isolated via stream capture, etc.), exploitation of weak, vertical fractures would be my go to answer.",

For smaller features like hoodoos, lower vegetation density that tends to come with arid climates likely play a role in their morphology, but for larger features like pinacles, this effect would likely be relatively small (and we see pinacles and similar features in humid climates).",

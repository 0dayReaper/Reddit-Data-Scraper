    "postText": "Hi, I'm Melanie McField, Founder and Director of the [Healthy Reefs for Healthy People Initiative](https://www.healthyreefs.org/cms/) (HRI), a multi-institutional effort comprising 73 partner organizations working to conserve the Mesoamerican Reef. Operating in Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, we track the health of the reefs in the area and evaluate each country's reef management efforts. I have a PhD in Marine Science from the University of South Florida and have also worked for the World Wildlife Fund and the Smithsonian Institution. I'm the author of more than 40 peer-reviewed research papers and the recipient of the 2021 Conservation Award from the International Coral Reef Society.\n\nIn 2013, an uncharted coral reef was discovered off the coast of Belize and Guatemala - but was kept rather secret until this year. Dubbed \"The Cayman Crown,\" this reef surpasses the size of Manhattan and is a refuge for a vast array of marine life, from schools of yellow jack and blue tang to bottlenose dolphins to the critically endangered - and commercially important - Nassau grouper. While not wholly immune to the dangers that face other reefs, such as overfishing, bleaching and invasive species, this reef's remarkable resilience is likely due to its position on the edge of the Cayman Trench. The hope is that this discovery can mark a new chapter in understanding corals and in saving coral reefs worldwide.\n\nThe Cayman Crown was given protected status in 2020 by both Belize and Guatemala, but there is still much to be done to ensure its conservation. You can learn more and see the first-ever footage of the reef in the new PBS *Nature* documentary \"[Treasure of the Caribbean](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/about-treasure-caribbean/28747/),\" now available to stream in the US.\n\nI'll be answering your questions at 1 pm ET (17 UT). Ask me anything!\n\nUsername: /u/MelanMcReefs77",

But now artificial reefs are being made with better materials - more eco-friendly cement, metal, native stones... they do provide habitat and some ecosystem services.   But they also cost a lot to create and maintain. It is far better to protect what we have - the full biodiversity can not be replaced with these structures, especially when the water quality and overfishing problems still exist.",

One I visited in Honduras I saw that the majority of the coral being grown and transplanted was staghorn. When I asked why this was I was told that it seems to be the species they'd seen the most decline in and it was fast growing. \n\nWould it make more sense to try and bolster populations that are obviously not well suited to disease and changing environments, or would it be better to focus on coral that is better adapted to future needs?\n\nAs a follow up if you have time I've noticed that a fair number of projects I've seen have questionable oversight, especially in Latin America where there are a lot of enclaves of retired US citizens that move their specifically to dive. I think many of these are well intentioned, but I sometimes have to bite my tongue when I learn that they consult a marine biologist every few months but otherwise run independently and have mostly just been going by trial and error. What are your thoughts on projects like these? I study community ecology (not marine), and I've been hesitant to grill these projects because I'm largely unfamiliar with the structure and success rates of these sorts of outfits.",

                            "comment": "I'm late, but as someone who has done work on the freshwater side, and kept saltwater aquarium myself, I do want to mention that there are a few specific circumstances where wild caught is an overall good.\n\nIn the freshwater industry, the Cardinal Tetra is a fairly common fish. In the wild they live in the Rio Negro, or the Northern Amazon. The forests they live in floods in the wet season and dries up in the dry season. During the dry season, millions, possibly billions of fish are caught in ponds that will dry out before the end of the dry season. These fish are taken from those ponds before they are depleted of oxygen, and are brought into the aquarium trade. Overall this action has zero effect on the wild breeding population, and is able to bring in millions of dollars to an area that would otherwise be a ripe target for logging and agriculture. Cardinal Tetras are not the only fish in these ponds. Angelfish (especially the once rare Altum Angels), Discus, some Corydoras species, Rummynose Tetras, various Plecostomus species are all found here.\n\nThis of course has to be balanced, overharvesting of these animals can be a problem for forest dwelling fauna that rely on them for food, however much of the food chain for these animals is aquatic, and the projects that are set up are done in a way to not overharvest any one area in any given year.\n\nOver the past few years, the Cardinal Tetra has become a hardier fish in the aquarium trade than it's cousin, the Neon Tetra due to this massive influx of new genetics to the captive population. Meanwhile the Neon is becoming harder and harder to keep due to a lack of genetic diversity and awful management of the species in the aquarium trade (the Neon Tetra lives in the southern Amazon where the rivers don't really leave their banks, and is not really harvested anymore).\n\nOf course, this is a very specific case, and does not apply to most other species.\n\nIf you do see this I do have a question, how do you feel about maricultured corals?",

Also we continue to learn how to breed more marine fish in captivity every day. It's mainly just the economics that it's cheaper to catch some common species than to aquaculture them. If more prohibitions against export like the Caribbean happened, the industry would easily adapt.",

For conservation I'd say marine protected areas with FULL PROTECTION from fishing work best - along with coastal zone and watershed management to control pollution and habitat destruction on land.

For instance, I won't go back to Roatan again because the then-vs-now changes are just too heartbreaking.\n\nI know divers can cause reef damage, especially to delicate hard corals, but the destruction I've seen due to agricultural runoff, climate change and warming oceans, over-fishing, and mass cruise ship tourism seem to dwarf any problems caused by divers. On the flip side, the dive tourism economy may promote local stewardship of reefs and sea life (notably sharks) because, well, we only want to dive where there is a healthy reef. Many divers, including myself, are probably much more environmentally conscious about reefs than the general public.\n\nMy question for you is this: Do you view the scuba tourism industry as a net positive force or a negative force for preserving reefs?",

So the needs are really the same - the reef needs to survive and thrive for the local community to thrive. There are some short term challenges for creating fully protected areas - needs of income diversification for those fishers impacted, but this is only for 5 years or so, until the replenishment can happen naturally from the broodstock in the fully protected zones.  Without these replenishment zones - the local communities will suffer as the fish become more and more depleted with no chances of replenishment. These zones are a boon to tourism and make the overall reef more resilient to all stress.",

I have seen pristine reefs in water that was almost uncomfortably warm\u2026far from any tourists. But diving another reef just 100 miles away, but with several beachside resorts on shore, the bleaching was catastrophic. \n\nLikewise, I\u2019ve kept successful reef aquariums for decades, at temperatures ranging from mid-70s to low-80s\u2026but the one time I neglected to wash my hands and arms of sunscreen before reaching into the tank\u2026utter disaster.\n\nWhat\u2019s your opinion on the sunscreen contribution to coral bleaching? Am I correctly correlating my observations?",

But think about the total global area of coral reefs - all of them are experiencing increased temperatures and acidification (to different degrees). Corals in the Red Sea have adapted over millennia to high temperatures... the problem now is the rate of change and this change is everywhere. So overall I think climate change is a bigger problem than sunscreen - but we still need to avoid sunscreens in the ocean -  wear long sleeves , leggings, hats etc. Its not an either or solution - we need to fix both problems.",

Getting the right group of dedicated reef stewards together, as we have done in the Healthy Reefs Initiative, is the best way to fortify the good collaborative efforts oof the reef stewards and communities, and push back against the selfish bad ideas - and general inertia and lack of political action that tends to set in to our societies.",

Dig further there are opportunities but you need to meet a lot of people in the field and demonstrate how valuable your skill set would be to their team.",

We know the reefs will be more resilient to all stressors in the areas that are fully protected from fishing - allowing the full complexity of trophic relationships to re-emerge. So keep working on those old threats too - sewage treatment, solid waste disposal, overfishing - while you treat the most important reef's corals.  Pro-biotic treatments may be on the way.... but this is also very labor intensive. The disease will run its course. Many more corals will die - but if we can have enough intact ecosystems left - the reef can rebuild itself.",

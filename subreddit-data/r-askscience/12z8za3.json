            "comment": "Yes, sort-of. You can do an experiment right now to see how the size of your ears affects your hearing. Simply cup your hands behind each ear to make them bigger and observe the changes to your hearing. You may notice that sounds become clearer in the direction that you are aiming the \"radar dish\" of your ears, and that's because you are collecting more of the sound wave coming from that direction. More vibrational energy is reaching your ear drum and sending a stronger electrical signal to your brain. \n\nHowever, how each person's brain interprets the signal after it's turned from vibration to neurons is more complex. Just like colors, sound isn't really an objective thing in our reality; it's made up in our brains as the way we perceive small vibrations in the air around us. If the areas in our brain that interpret those signals are damaged or develop differently in the first place, what we seem to \"hear\" will be a unique experience for each person, even if the shape and size of our ears is identical.",

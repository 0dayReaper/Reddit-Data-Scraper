                    "comment": "Sorry to piggyback on the top answer, but if anyone's interested in impacts other than carbon footprint, here's an answer I wrote further down:\n\nI wrote a paper that's open access, which you can find here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914008745\n\nThe TLDR is that solar is good in terms of climate change but generally less good in terms of other impacts. Overall it's typically not as good as wind or nuclear power. However, bear in mind two things:\n\n1. Impacts are very dependent on location. E.g. solar installed here in the UK is worse than in Nevada or Spain because the impacts are all up-front but you get much more energy output in sunny countries, therefore better impacts per kWh.\n2. Solar technology is moving fast. I actually have some updated figures that I'd love to share with you but they're not published yet, so they're not peer-reviewed. Reductions in impacts in the past few years have been considerable: about 50% reduction between 2005 and 2015. So for instance I now estimate a carbon footprint of about 45 g CO2-eq./kWh for a UK installation or 27 g in Spain. This contrasts with the figure of 89g you'll see in the paper I linked.\n\nEDIT: my first gilding - thank you!",

                                    "comment": "Well like many industrial processes there are some fairly nasty chemicals involved, so to an extent we're relying on good regulation. There have been a few cases in China where various toxic spills have occurred from solar plants (e.g. see [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/08/AR2008030802595.html?referrer=emailarticle)). \n\nThere are also some issues with specific types of solar power, e.g. CdTe cells or CIGS cells, which contain cadmium. As you probably know, Cd is very toxic. There's currently a lot of work going on to eliminate Cd from all consumer equipment, so this should be solved in time.\n\nIn context though, it's important to remember that all of these impacts tend to be minimal compared to the environmental and health implications of coal power. So as long as we're replacing coal, it's still easily a benefit. And, of course, solar isn't much different to many other high tech industries, so it's not like the issues I mentioned above are uniquely problematic.\n\nEDIT: a few people below are correctly pointing out that CIGS is copper-indium-gallium-selenium. However, normally there is cadmium in the buffer layer. There are basically 4 layers: molybdenum -&gt; CIGS -&gt; cadmium sulphide -&gt; doped zinc oxide.",

It's easy to see how the only things you see about mining in channels 7&amp;9 are about the jobs and opportunities they create! Never about how we cut billions from the hospital system and education (primary, secondary and tertiary) and gave almost the same amount of money to the mining industry in tax cuts (forget the exact numbers but it's like x.2 billion cut from hospital and x.5 billion given to mining industry)",

They do have higher specific efficiency, but they're also much more expensive to make, in both the financial and the energetic senses.\n\nAlso there is no Cdin CIGS cells -- CIGS stands for Copper Indium Gallium Telluride. CdTe cells are a thing, too, though.\n\nThe highest cell efficiencies are found in more complicated multi-junction devices -- devices designed to have multiple photon-absorbing regions, each designed to absorb photons of a particular wavelength. One issue with silicon solar cells is that you can't really extract more energy from a photon than (very roughly) the silicon bandgap energy (See: [the Schottky-Queissler limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shockley%E2%80%93Queisser_limit)), whereas multijunction solar cells let you get more energy from high-energy photons than you otherwise would.\n\nMid-range solar cells are mostly Silicon, and they come in two flavors: Monocrystalline (expensive), and polycrystalline (cheap). Monocrystalline solar cells are just that -- the entire solar cell is made from a single perfect (ish) crystal of silicon. Polycrystalline cells are made up of silicon that has lots of smaller crystals, typically with the crystal grain size on the order of a few centimeters across. These aren't as efficient as monocrystalline cells, since you lose some of your electrical current to defects at the crystal boundaries, but they're wayyyy cheaper to make than polycrystalline cells.\n\nThe low-end, in terms of both cost and efficiency, is organic solar cells. These are made of organic (i.e. carbon-containing i.e. sort of plastic-like) materials, and the general idea is that if you can get the efficiency high enough, then the low manufacturing cost will make up for the relatively low efficiency.\n\nSilicon cells are actually pretty easy to recycle, because they really don't have that much stuff in them. You have whatever metal you used for your contacts, silicon, and some dopants (impurities added to the silicon to alter its electrical properties). If you're recycling solar cells you probably have a much better idea of what's in your bins than if you're trying to recycle general trash.\n\nSource: am electrical engineer. Also wikipedia.",

Shale gas cannot be described as 'very low impact'. We also have estimates for shale gas in the paper above, but you'll see that it's very variable depending on industry practices.",

At this point, though, nuclear is expensive, difficult, and needs a long timeline for planning and implementation. Solar is much easier because it can be implemented in a piecemeal fashion. They definitely should not be prioritizing replacing nuclear power plants though, unless they are at the end of their lifecycles.",

(Warning: PDF)\n\nThe chart that most directly answers your question is on page 3.  Long story short: As of 2015, the battery does add a little to the emissions created when building the car.  A little.  Not anything like nine years' worth.  It takes an average EV about 4,900 miles of driving before it's break-even with an average gasoline car.  Every mile after that is in the EV's favor, and on average (even when grid-powered) the EV has about half the lifetime emissions.",

EVs do produce emissions from their operation, but it's less in basically every way than a comparable ICE. \n\nEVs usually have no gearbox (cars with hub motors are an example) or a very minimal one (Teslas, for example), so less energy is wasted in the drivetrain. Electric motors are also more efficient at converting the energy in the battery to torque on the driveshaft as compared to pistons in an ICE. Electric cars regenerate energy when braking or going downhill, too.\n\nFossil fuel generation at a power plant is also better than in a car. Turbines are run at their optimum speed, so they're very efficient at converting their heat to electricity. As per the [PDF](http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf) given by /u/raygundan a typical electric car powered entirely by coal plants would see a 1% reduction in emissions over the typical 2014 ICE. No region in the US uses entirely coal, so the EV is going to do much better than the ICE in basically all cases. The mix of power is shifting towards cleaner sources, so you can expect this to improve in the future, while an ICE car will stay the same (or even get worse if poorly maintained) for its whole life.",

They don't need to have gaskets replaced or timing belts. There are just so many fewer things that break down or need periodic maintenance that the environmental impact is even lower than just looking at initial build of the car and on-going energy usage.",

E.g. bear in mind that, even in a car with a very large battery like a Tesla Model S, the battery weighs about 500 kg, which is maybe a third of the car's total weight, and you're saving various metals that would otherwise be required in the engine, gearbox, etc. Most of the weight of the car is the same whether it's electric or otherwise: steel, aluminium, plastics. Granted, batteries contain some slightly exotic materials, but for instance they're only about 1% lithium, so again it's often overstated.\n\nHere's [a report](http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf) looking at these kinds of questions. There's certainly a lot of literature on this stuff but it seems that the scientific community is struggling to keep up to date with the ever-improving battery chemistries, manufacturing methods, etc. so we're chasing a moving target.",

Certain groups like to pretend like the \"science isn't in\" usually because it was cold one day and they brought a snowball to the debate or some such nonsense, or like we can simply reverse \"warming\" through some creative geoengineering. Acidification is real, cause irreversible damage, and happening _right now_, but fighting this nationalist tide and getting anyone to acknowledge that there are important things happening outside your borders is an uphill battle to say the least.",

Nuclear doesn't *have* to be expensive. A large part of the cost (at least in the USA) is purely bureaucracy... the total development cost for a reactor from design to development planning to approval ranges somewhere in the $1-2B range, of course this is due to all the regulatory checks that are necessary for *crappy old 1st and 2nd gen water-based reactors which are inherently unsafe*... The cost for a modern design could be a fraction of a LWR. Without the unnecessary regulatory hoops to jump through (usually regulations are useful, but in this case they are so rigid that you can't even propose a better design... which is inhibiting innovation), we could already be moving to SMR (small modular reactor) which are waaaaaay safer and at a significantly lower construction investment.\n\nThanks to the obstructionist politics of many of the anti-nuclear groups, we are stuck using these old and unsafe designs, just look up Greenpeace's position on nuclear (not going to link it because it's full of mostly false propaganda).",

You can even re-use spent fuel directly in existing reactor designs (referred to as DUPIC - direct use of pressurised water reactor spent fuel in CANDU reactors. See [here](http://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/fuel-recycling/processing-of-used-nuclear-fuel.aspx)).\n\nAnd there are several very cool Generation 4 designs that can burn most of the long-lived nasty stuff from spent fuel. The problem with all of this is that it isn't really economic yet. It is, at least, a good argument to not permanently seal waste away. You want to retain the possibility of taking that waste back out of a repository at some point in the future to use as fuel in a new reactor.",

The full lifecycle cost of nuclear is way higher than other commercial technologies (solar, hydro, wind, gas, or coal).  Anyone looking at investing in a nuclear plant can see the trends and realize that by the time they can plan, permit, build, and turn on a new nuclear plant, solar + battery will be so cheap they'll never recover their investment.  \n\nThe cost issue is so big and so obvious that companies are abandoning partially built nuclear reactors since the cost to even complete the plants, much less build them from scratch, isn't competitive with solar anymore.",

Source: I'm a lecturer in the UK (roughly equiv. to assistant professor in the USA) specialising in life cycle assessment, particularly energy sources.\n\nI wrote a paper that's open access, which you can find here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914008745\n\nThe TLDR is that solar is good in terms of climate change but generally less good in terms of other impacts. Overall it's typically not as good as wind or nuclear power. However, bear in mind two things:\n\n1. Impacts are very dependent on location. E.g. solar installed here in the UK is worse than in Nevada or Spain because the impacts are all up-front but you get much more energy output in sunny countries, therefore better impacts per kWh.\n2. Solar technology is moving fast. I actually have some updated figures that I'd love to share with you but they're not published yet, so they're not peer-reviewed. Reductions in impacts in the past few years have been considerable: about 50% reduction between 2005 and 2015. So for instance I now estimate a carbon footprint of about 45 g CO2-eq./kWh for a UK installation or 27 g in Spain. This contrasts with the figure of 89g you'll see in the paper I linked.",

With wind, everyone's basically settled on the design (three blade, horizontal axis) as the most efficient in most circumstances, so all you can really do is reduce component weights, improve control systems and, most importantly, increase scale. The power output correlates with the swept blade area, so if you increase the overall height of a turbine you get much more power output per unit of resource used, if you see what I mean. This is why the trend is for bigger and bigger turbines.\n\nWith solar, it's much more high tech, so there's a lot more things you can do. E.g. different doping of materials, different techniques for surface treatment, techniques like atomic layer deposition to deposit really thin layers of material and save on resources, and completely different chemistries entirely (i.e. non-silicon based panels). So generally speaking there's more space for innovation within solar.\n\nHaving said that the major driver of solar cost reduction in recent years hasn't been technological improvement, it's been production moving from Germany/Japan/USA to China.",

Heavy metal pollution near fabs is unlikely to be a big problem, but heavy metal pollution from the mining of the resources themselves will be an issue. Generally speaking mining causes leaching or aerial emissions via the mine itself or the tailings left behind. So, to a very rough approximation, the amount of mining per unit of energy produced predicts the amount of heavy metal pollution. For coal power, the amount of mining (i.e. tonnage of coal extracted) is vastly higher than the amount of mining required in renewable life cycles, by orders of magnitude. So heavy metal emissions are much higher for coal.\n\nIn the paper I linked above, look at Figure 4, especially the freshwater and marine eco-toxicity results. You'll see that coal is off the scale. The situation's a bit unclear for terrestrial toxicity and human toxicity, and I don't have much info on GaAs.\n\nAs for subsidy, it depends heavily on the country we're looking at. In the UK, recent large-scale solar power projects are clearing our 'contract-for-difference' auction system at a price that's not much different to nuclear or even natural gas, which implies that subsidies aren't a major requirement for solar any more. If you go back to roughly 2010, the subsidies for domestic solar systems were about \u00a30.45/kWh, which basically covered the entire cost of the installation, so things have changed.",

The expense of GaAs materials encourages proper handling and limiting waste (not saying heavy metal pollution near GaAs fabs does not occur at all, as not all manufacturers have the same concerns for the environment or their profitability).\n\nFor Si cell manufacturing, after SiO2, the largest quantities of waste products would be hydrofluoric acid, used to clean the cells / wafers before deposition of Al and Ag, and evaporated isopropyl alcohol, used to clean just about everything in all stages of cell and module production.  Some furnace types utilize molybdenum (literally a heavy metal) to distribute heat evenly to the Si pellets being melted in quartz crucibles.  The Mo bricks are reused many times after cleaning and can be recycled once worn down below specifications.  The quartz crucibles degrade during a production run and typically are used only once.  The feed tubes that replenish the Si during growth are quartz as well and tend to break if their positioning must be adjusted during a run.  The quartz can be recycled, where cost effective to do so. Scrap Si, Al, and Ag can all be reused, but reclaimed Si already contains dopants like Sb, which will require extra care in future runs to not exceed the dopant levels needed for the grade of Si crystals to be grown.",

But of course as the amount of solar, wind etc. increases, the more storage you potentially need. So it isn't possible to add storage to a grid-oriented assessment like this unless you make a whole pile of other assumptions.\n\nIn case of stand-alone systems though, there are some assessments of solar+battery but many of them use lead acid batteries (e.g. [this paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X09000590)) instead of something more modern like lithium chemistries.

The term you're looking for is [Energy Returned on Energy Invested](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_returned_on_energy_invested), or EROEI.\n\nPut simply, any given source of energy is a \"work multiplier\" -- you expend a bit of energy to get more energy out.\n\nThese things are complicated and numbers can change on the methodology used, but the wikipedia article has a table to give you good orders-of-magnitude to start with:\n\n- A Saudi oil well in the 1970's was a 30:1 return on energy\n- Today that oil well is on the order of 15:1\n- PV/solar is ~ 7:1\n- Wind is ~ 18:1\n- Shale oil (\"the fracking revolution\") is ~5:1\n- Tar sands (\"Keystone XL\") is ~3:1\n\nLooking at our oil sources from an EROEI point of view, we're expending more and more energy to get less and less energy back.  All that new exploration and \"technological improvements\" is giving us a worse return.  Clearly looks like we're scraping the bottom of the barrel here.\n\nNow, compare that to renewables like solar and wind... the numbers don't lie, it's nowhere near as big a windfall as that sweet 1970's crude, but here's the difference: the extractive technologies are getting worse and worse as we take more out (not a peak oil guy, but it clearly looks like there's less of the good stuff), while solar and wind are manufacturing technologies where *the more we build, the better we get at building it*.\n\nIn other words, the EROEI of extractive fossil fuels is clearly going down, while the EROEI of manufacturable renewables goes up.\n\nOne offers a path forward, the other is a dead-end.",

Problems created from mines are much easier to re-mediate than spills from oil, or air problems with coal. [Do not confuse 'easier' with 'easy'].\n\nSolar panels can work for their entire life span without polluting their local environment. The bulk of the pollution created is in the vicinity of the mine and the plant where they are created. With fossil fuel, pollution is created constantly over its life at the point(s) where it is being used--by your car, your water heater, your local power plant.",

Pollutants are probably similar to what is seen in the silicon chip industry (silicon dust, which is a health risk, heavy metals, etc...).  The flip side of this is that because it's all focused on one end of the products life cycle it's probably much easier to handle (we have a much better understanding of how to clean up a factory than we do about cleaning up the atmosphere).  Unfortunately I do not know any solid numbers to compare :(\n\n\nA better question might be \"how long does a solar panel need to run in order to become 'green'?\". That is, how long does it have to run before the amount of pollution created by it during it's lifetime is less than that produced by fossil fuel for the same amount of product (electricity).",

            "comment": "Well, Silicon is the most abundant element per weight on earth after oxygen. To purify it from quartz it takes a certain amount of energy through electrolysis.  Quite a lot of electrical energy is needed since we need to reduce silicon from +4 to 0. That means 4 electrons per atom of silicon at some 2 V. In comparison to iron which needs 2 electrons at 1 Volt (just using arbitrary numbers here because I can't be bothered to look them up). As such, It takes roughly 4 times the amount of electricity per mol, a little less per kilo.  \n\nThis is roughly the same amount of energy gained by burning coal atom for atom. 1 mol coal = 1 mol silicon --&gt; 1 kg coal = ~1/2 kg silicon per weight if we assume 100 stochiometric conversion. The engineering around electrolysis is trivial for this question. Depending on the source of electricity and silicate this step can approach carbon neutrality. \n\nHowever, the purification, doping and making wafers can be quite energy intensive, but could arguably be done at a fraction of the energy needed for electrolysis. But we're still depending on the source of electricity. \n\nOnce reduced to elemental silicone, recycling silicon wafers costs a fraction of the energy needed for electrolysis. \n\nCan a silicon wafer deliver more electricity throughout it's lifetime than what is consumed during electrolysis and refinement, yes and by a large margin. \n\nSo it all boils down to the source of electricity and quartz, and transport from mine to installment. This can vary a lot. In all, silicon can easily be net carbon neutral or better. \n\nCompared to petroleum, which is more or less energy for free considering you simply put a straw in the ground and \"drink all the milkshake\". On the other hand, petroleum is not even remotely carbon neutral for obvious reasons. The main difference is the upfront energy cost needed to reduce silicate to silicon, but once there, PV is energy for free forever after.",

            "comment": "top comment is about C02, let me comment on energy requirements of production. \n\nin 2006, the term needed to earn back the energy needed for production of solar panels varied wildly between sources. some said 4 years, mainly in older sources and of installations in moderate climates, others quoted 9 months (desert installation). The interesting part of this study was that the variance was strongly influenced by the mounting bracket. It turned out that allu brackets with concrete weights took up quite some energy to make, while building integrated systems didn't have that problem.\n\nA great improvement in \"return on energy\" is to be expected from thin foil systems. apparently already on the market but not very wide spread atm. \n\nthe premise of my master dissertation was \" how much would electricity cost if it was produced by renewable energy sources, in available means, in a feasible energy mix (yeah, 100% hydro is cheating), if those renewable energy sources were produced by renewable energy sources.\n",

            "comment": "Just outside Las Vegas, they have a solar power plant where they use mirrors to reflect light to a tower where the heat generated is used to boil water in order to spin turbines. Since this method does not use typical solar panels, is this more or less environmentally friendly and is this more or less efficient?",

                    "comment": "I did a case study on this in my final-year at University - the Ivanpah facility near Vegas is a pretty bad example. In summary, there are two major competing technologies in \"Concentrated Solar-thermal (CST)\", water based and molten salt based. \n\nIvanpah is the former - meaning there is no facility to store energy. This causes issues as the power-tower must use natural gas boilers to start the turbines in the morning every day.\n\nOn the contrary, there are power-tower systems installed (for example Gemasolar in Andalucia, Spain) which store energy for gradual release overnight and for startup in thermal tanks as molten salt (&gt;800 degrees C). \n\nOverall, this is not a preferred method of solar generation any more, as the cost of concentrated solar-thermal has not really decreased, and the price of typical Solar-PV systems has massively fallen. Environmentally, the impact on CST systems is pretty similar to Solar PV, though there is more direct impact on the installation locale (think birds being vaporised and pilots being blinded by the intense reflected light).",

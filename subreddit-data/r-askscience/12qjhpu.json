    "postText": "The first months of 2023 have seen reports of outbreaks of Marburg virus from several countries in East Africa. Closely related to Ebola virus, Marburg is highly contagious and incredibly virulent, spreads through direct contact, and has no known treatment. How worried should we be about the spread of Marburg virus disease?\n\nJoin us today between 12 and 4 PM ET for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, to look at the known biological, clinical and epidemiological aspects of the Marburg virus. We'll answer questions about the current state of research into the virus, give updates on progress into potential treatments and cures, share steps that can (and should) be taken to contain the ongoing outbreaks, and discuss broad strategies that can help prevent future zoonotic disease spillovers.\n\nAsk us anything!\n\nWith us today are:\n\n+ [Christopher Basler, Ph.D.](https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/basler-lab/) (/u/filovirus_mol_bio)- Professor, Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai\n+ [Melinda Brindley, Ph.D.](https://melindabrindley.wixsite.com/brindleylab) (/u/aka-Virologist)- Associate Professor, Department of Infectious Disease, Department of Population Health, University of Georgia\n+ [Jana Broadhurst, M.D., Ph.D., DTMH](https://asm.org/Biographies/Jana-Broadhurst,-M-D-,-Ph-D-,-DTMH) (/u/InfDzDx)- Assistant Professor, Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center\n+ [Elke M\u00fchlberger, Ph.D.](https://www.bu.edu/muhlbergerlab/) (/u/BSL4-viruses)- Professor, Department of Virology, Immunology and Microbiology, Chobanian and Avedisian School of Medicine, Boston University\n\nLinks:\n\n+ [Marburg virus outbreaks are increasing in frequency and geographic spread - three virologists explain.](https://theconversation.com/marburg-virus-outbreaks-are-increasing-in-frequency-and-geographic-spread-three-virologists-explain-200486)\n+ [Marburg Virus Disease Emergence: An Update.](https://asm.org/Articles/2023/March/Marburg-Virus-Disease-Emergence-An-Update)",

The paper goes on to show the ways the gov tried to stifle these practices and failed due to very poor implementation and crisis management. \n\nDo you see this happening again with Marburg? Have the local governments learned from their past mistakes on how to handle these things?\n\nAlso, Is there a possibility of mutation that can cause it to be more transmissible due to it being a single-stranded RNA virus and is there a history around it? Can this outbreak lead to an epidemic in the area or will the extremely high virulence end up stamping itself out? \n\n-A (hopefully) future virologist",

Previous studies in my lab have examined how temperature alters Zika transmission and replication and how different RNA viruses enter cells. Some are easier to work with in the lab which increases the types of experiments you can run. It is also fun exploring what can be learned from viruses that are more difficult to work with.

I am curious about how that is being communicated, specifically the cross-cultural aspects of helping the affected populations make safer choices without offending their cultural traditions.",

It's really bad luck to get infected with filoviruses through close contact to bats. Moreover, eating bats doesn't completely explain it.

The mammalian derivation of this system is far more robust than other vertebrates, with humans arguably at or near the peak of this refinement, alongside bats. Since much of the scenario you\u2019re thinking of is probably informed by SARS-CoV2, it probably bears mentioning that the virus has a case fatality rate that is still numerically very low, I haven\u2019t seen a single country over 4%, and most are under 2% (the US, for example, is about 1.1% even with its bungled first year of response).

Most are viral-vectored vaccines and use either an adenovirus or vesicular stomatitis virus vector. Not all of the vaccine candidates have gone through safety trials in humans and we currently do not have large quantities of the vaccines.\n\nThe WHO is determining if the current outbreaks can be used to further test the vaccines that have completed safety trials.\n\nThis was recently discussed at [https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00468-5](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00468-5)",

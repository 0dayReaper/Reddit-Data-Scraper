            "comment": "[Five *Purgatorius* molars were discovered at Harley's Point in NE Montana, USA](https://www.washington.edu/news/2021/02/24/earliest-primate-fossils/). Two of these molars were a match to *Purgatorius janisae*, which was already known from younger strata. One molar was distinct enough that it was assigned to a new species, *Purgatorius mckeeveri*, and two other molars found at the site were tentatively assigned to that new species as well.\n\nWhat made these teeth particularly notable was that [they were extremely close to the K/Pg boundary, maybe 105\u2013139 thousand years after the Chixulub impactor](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210050). This meant that these two *Purgatorius* species were the earliest-known fossil primates (and, indeed, the earliest euarchonts of any kind) found to date, and their proximity to the Cretaceous extinction line meant that the entire lineage almost certainly evolved in the Cretaceous.",

    "postText": "Just curious. I know there are innumerable environmental factors at play in evolution, but one would think that if the largest flying animal with a membrane wing is Quetzalcoatlus with a wingspan of 40 ft, and the largest animal with a feathered wing is Argentavis magnificens with a wingspan of 23 ft, then, at least when it comes to larger animals, membrane wings must be more efficient. Is this true?",

            "comment": "Hopefully a biologist will chime in, but from a physics standpoint, it seems reasonable that membrane wings would scale up better.  Materials tend to have better tensile strength vs. flexural strength, meaning that it is easier (and lighter) to keep something from tearing than to keep it from bending.  Feathers catch air by staying straight, membrane wings catch air by not tearing.",

Those are elastic skin-like wings, like those in bats, the same skin-like structure like the webbed feet in frogs.\n\n[Patagium](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patagium)",

And those feathers can regrow in a timely manner.\n\nMembrane? Poke a hole in your wing and good luck. You're most likely unable to fly, and Will most likely perrish.\n\nAlso feathers have insulating properties, while Membrane wings are completely exposed.",

The creature body weight can affect the need for larger wingspan as well.\n\nI think feathered wings are more rigid and shaped like aerofoil thus have more efficient weight/lift ratio (probably because of this they don't need to have wide wingspan like membrane wings animal), also their bones are actually hollow.",

            "comment": "The size limits don't seem to come down to the weight/lift ratio or efficiency of feathers vs membranes, but instead other differences.  \n\nFeathers have to be molted and replaced.  This takes time which increases as the feathers get larger, and very large birds struggle to keep a usable compliment of fully grown flight feathers because they take so long to replace.  It takes condors 3-4 months to replace a flight feather, for example, and they can't molt very many at once or they won't have enough to fly.  \n\nAnother important difference is ground-launching.  Birds push off the ground using their hind legs.  They need muscles in their legs to get airborne, and they have to carry those muscles around while flying, even though they don't contribute to flight.  Pterosaurs, on the other hand, used their forelimbs to vault into the air.  Their flight muscles did double-duty, which allowed them to need to carry less weight and improved scaling allowing for bigger sizes.",

In Europe and America we have large birds and small bats, but in South-East Asia they have [huge bats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pteropus#External_characteristics) and few large birds in same habitat.",

                    "comment": "A lot of the variation is due to scale effects. Tiny flying animals have significant buoyancy in air and operate at much lower Reynolds numbers than most birds, and those factors have a lot to do with why they fly so differently and have such different structures.\n\nIt's interesting that the smallest flying animals and the largest (such as Quetzalcoatlus) both have membrane wings, though. There's either something very different about how Quetzalcoatlus flew, compared to birds, or there are non-aerodynamic advantages of membrane wings, such as strength to weight ratio, that are important at the size of Quetzalcoatlus.",

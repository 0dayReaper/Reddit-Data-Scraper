    "postText": "While I understand that city pigeons may frequently be mangled by predators such as cats and rats, these mutilations seem to me far more frequent among pigeons than other liminal species, including other birds. Have there been any studies about this? Is my (entirely unscientific) perception perhaps erroneous, or could it stem from some kind of survivor bias (pigeons may find it easier to survive with one or both mangled feet than other animals)?",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm a wildlife veterinarian in a huge metropolitan areas. Because of their natural history, pigeons spend a huge amount of time walking, rather than perching or hopping compared with other birds. Since they're in cities, they tend to gather string materials around their toes, most commonly human hair in my experience but sometimes textiles and synthetic fibers. They get all tangled and knotted, and they aren't able to untangle it. Pigeon toe amputations are the most common surgery I do, but we're lucky they do so well with so few toes.",

There are guides on how to do this, and for most cases it just requires some seeds (or even just plain oatmeal) and a pair of very tiny scissors. Edit: You DO need to make sure you are holding them correctly and not putting any pressure on their chest, though; only enough to keep their wings closed.\n\nI sometimes help with a volunteer city bird rehab organization that does this a lot, as well as paying to take them (and other birds) to vets when needed. They are domesticated animals who are basically only in cities because we put them there and then stopped caring for them, so helping them suffer a bit less is kind of the least we can do.\n\nETA: To summarize my other replies &amp; after reading a bit more - pigeons appear to only _very_ rarely contract some very specific strains of bird flu, and in those observed cases, still don't appear to be particularly infective toward other birds (which are much better hosts than humans). Given the short amount of time that it takes to handle a pigeon and that you will want to wash your hands after touching their dirty feet anyway, I would say that the risk is negligible, especially if you are not immunocompromised and there is not currently a local outbreak.",

Based on the scientific literature, they appear to be ~~unable~~ (edit) _extremely_ unlikely to carry bird flu, and there's not really anything else we can catch with the obvious exception that if you have open wounds, you don't want to get anything in there. The main disease concern would be that if you have your own birds at home, you should wash thoroughly and probably change your clothes too. Otherwise, just be aware of any local laws.\n\nThey do struggle, but they aren't really capable of hurting you, and they rarely bite (and it doesn't really hurt if they do). Mainly they flap and scrabble with their claws to get away, which could scratch a little. They tend to calm down if their head is covered and they are held on their back while you work on their feet. **Note:** it IS important to hold a pigeon correctly for their safety! Birds can't breathe if you hold their chest tightly, so only enough to keep their wings folded.",

I read a couple papers where they experimentally exposed pigeons to huge doses of different types of avian influenza (way above the infective dose), and no pigeon was found to be sick or carrying the virus afterward. This is obviously something that is a research priority for public health, so the possibility has been studied quite a bit. I am of course open to the possibility that new research could come out showing the opposite, but the papers I read didn't seem to have any obvious methodological problems as I recall. I was myself concerned about this since my partner is an organ transplant patient, but was satisfied that it's not a realistic risk. I do avoid other types of city bird patients during local outbreaks, though.",

Both the males and the females make milk, which the squabs access by sticking their beaks down their parents\u2019 throats. This adaptation is found in very few birds and evolved along a completely separate path from the milk found in mammals.\u201d\n\nGood lord",

Nothing worked in ED, so I get called to examine.\n\nMy initial concerns were of poorly healed fgm or perhaps undiagnosed intersex, because the clitoris appeared to extend outwardly, was bulbous, very red, and had become fluid filled.\n\nThat didn't quite make sense seeing as she only noted this change recently. Husband took one look and walked out the room.\n\nI then looked a bit closer... And see this tiny little black line under what looked much like a mini glans penis. And it dawned on me.\n\nShe had a single incredibly long pubic hair that had wound itself around the clitoris, and tourniquet'd it, causing the swelling and pain as blood flow is cut off. Basically, her clitoris had hung itself with pubic hair as the rope.\n\nIt was quite the site to behold.\n\nAnyway, soon as it was cut, the pain settled.\n\nTldr, human hair is scary stuff.

People in my generation (Z) have this idea that they world will 'end' in our life time. \n\nFor one, climate change isn't a comet, so it's more of a slow reduction in quality of life. \n\nSecondly, peoples' will to live is strong enough that it will probably take a couple hundred years for all of us to die off. \n\nThird, the world won't end, it just won't be compatible with human life. Give it a few million years and there might be another sapient species that can learn from our mistakes.\n\nFourth, people are already dying in the global South, developed countries are just seeing things get more expensive without the wage increase to match. This will only get worse unless there's a violent revolution, in which case there will be blood in the streets, no medical system, and no functioning power grid.\n\nB) 'People' are not responsible for this, corporations and power structures are. I don't know about you, but I don't choose to use plastic, it's the only option. Living in the US, I don't get to choose universal healthcare, minimizing the military or industrial complex, competent environmental policy, or breaking up monopolies. It's not on the ballot.\n\n You can argue that 'we' vote right wing and it's our fault, but that's ignoring the systemic defunding of education, malnutrition, lack of mental healthcare, and constant propaganda. Many of us don't have the privilege of being rational actors.",

I don't know if it'll change your mind about it, but I'd at least like to give the perspective people in this field have. \n\nMost of the places are run on charity and donation, though I believe in the US there are some that do receive some government assistance (but that's pretty atypical). It is very tough work, and the rehabbers can work 16+ hour days consecutively during baby season. As a charity we are not compensated very well for our time, and may have other jobs. There is a lot of emotional strain too, as release of the animals is the goal and a lot of issues cannot be fixed, which leads to high rates of euthanasia. As the veterinarian, my job and goal is to help animals recover and return to live their lives as healthy as possible, and when I can't do that, to prevent and ease suffering and pain. We have a lot of animals that suffer from both natural and human-caused issues, and I agree to let nature run it's course for some things. But when I have a swan that has a horrible unfixable wing fracture, an arthritic raccoon slowly starving because he can't compete for food, or a snapping turtle with its intestines hanging out from a car collision, I feel morally responsible to end the suffering that animal is experiencing. The same goes for pigeons, rats, mice, and every other 'nuisance' species, because life is challenging and just because you were introduced to an area you shouldn't have been or facing threats you're not adapted to doesn't mean you shouldn't be treated with compassion or have to have a long drawn out death. Wildlife rehab centers often receive hate for euthanizing animals or working on vermin, but we try to do the best for the animal that we can with what we have.\n\nThe number of toe amputations I perform varies seasonally, from about 1 every 3 weeks to 3 per week. Pigeons are phenomenal at healing, and often adapt well to missing toes. Once they've healed and are ready, we release them around their home.\n\nFinally, and this is my own personal opinion, pigeons are absolutely wonderful and have become my favorite patients. They are pretty sweet and nice, silly, great parents despite the bad nests they build, and have a lot of variety. They get a lot of hate nowadays because people only see them as dirty poop machines, but they are only doing what they can to survive, same as the rest of us. Actually, the vast majority of pigeons are descended from domesticated pigeons and have re-feralized, like dingos. They were bred all over and were used for meat, messaging, and as status symbols for more than 2000 years. They have a fascinating history.",

I did wild bird rehab for years and it was not uncommon for a baby to be found with something around the leg or a toe and the limb was now at risk of being lost. Birds don\u2019t need help with nesting material, they do ok on their own.",

Synthetic thread and fibers, plastic and as mentioned by another person in this thread, human hair. These materials can tangle around pigeon feet and toes, cutting off circulation which eventually leads to amputation. \n\nAnother thing i read was that the pigeons lose toes to infections, caused by standing in dirty/chemical loaded puddles. Buildup of chewing gum around the nails was also mentioned as cause of infection and eventual loss of toes.\n\nBoth seems plausible to me, but I also wonder why only pigeons seem to be infected. Other city birds seem to be doing fine.",

In the wild, birds perch on round branches, they walk through dirt that actually helps remove feces, they walk over rocks that help build up the foot muscles, they bathe in clean water. In cities, surfaces are mostly flat, covered in filth, with often little access to actually clean water. It screws with the tendons and physiology of the foot, and the poor hygiene issues just compound. \n\nFor you home bird keepers, that's why it's important to offer the appropriate sized perches and perches with varying thicknesses, and a variety of substrates to walk over outside the cage. Perches are so important.",

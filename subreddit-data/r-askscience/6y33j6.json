They're still very hot, just not hot enough for the light they're emitting to be enough to see through eclipse glasses. Basically, there are strong magnetic fields in those locations that are inhibiting the normal surface convection of those areas, thus keeping them somewhat cooler than the rest of the sun.",

                                                    "comment": "It can be really really bad. \n\n&gt; A June, 2010 report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), in conjunction with the Department of Energy, warned that \"Geomagnetic storms... not only can develop rapidly but also have continental footprints that can result in widespread, simultaneous impact to many points on the system. The system is not designed to operate through the simultaneous loss of many key assets.... \" Power grids around the world rely on extra-high voltage (EHV) custom-built transformers for power transmission. In an extreme geomagnetic storm, the 2010 NERC report estimates-based on the scenario in Figure 9- that ~350 EHV transformers in the United States \"will exceed levels where the transformer is at risk of irreparable damage,\" collapsing large portions of the power grid. \"These multi-ton apparatus generally cannot be repaired in the field, and if damaged in this manner, they need to be replaced with new units, which have manufacture lead times of 12 months or more\" (National Academy of Sciences, 2008). Full recovery could take 4-10 years (National Academy of Sciences, 2008)\n[source](http://www.governmentattic.org/24docs/UnpubFEMAgeomagRpts_2010.pdf)\n\nWhat happens when millions of people lose power, telecom, banking and finance, petroleum and natural gas, transportation, food, water, and emergency services for a year? Let's come back to that. \n\nFirst let's consider that [according to a commission set up by the House Armed Services Committee](https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Baker-Statement-5-13-EMP.pdf), the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) which I mentioned above generally downplays the threat:\n\n&gt; The standards ultimately developed by NERC include a set of operational procedures requiring no physical protection of the electric grid and a scientifically-flawed benchmark GMD threat description that enables most U.S. utilities to avert installing physical protection based on their own paper modeling studies. The benchmark GMD threat description is based on solar storm statistics over the last 25 years during which there were no \u201cCarrington Class\u201d 100-year solar superstorms. The Carrington-class storm GMD levels are an order of magnitude higher than the largest storms in the NERC 25 year data window. NERC\u2019s benchmark event is admissible only if we assume that all eleven-year solar cycles are the same, an assumption known to be incorrect. A skeptic might suspect that the NERC standard\u2019s main objective was to avert liability rather than protect the public from serious GMD consequences.\n\nOkay then, maybe we can shut down the grid at the first sign of trouble to prevent damage?\n\n&gt; The 15-45 minute warning time earlier provided by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) satellite and now supported by the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) successor will be inadequate for grid operators to confer while executing required operational procedures. Participants in the 2011 National Defense University-Johns Hopkins University GMD response exercise indicated that they would be hard-pressed even to get all the players to the table within such a short time interval. And, once hit, the grid would fail quickly. We note that, in 1989, during a moderate solar storm GMD, the electric power grid of the entire Province of Quebec went dark in 92 seconds. The August 2003 Northeast Blackout evolved much more slowly (1:31pm \u2013 4:10pm) with much more time available to take action. Nonetheless, even with a span of hours available, power companies were unable to react fast enough to prevent grid collapse.\n\n&gt; Grid operators will not have adequate information on the state of the grid to implement correct operational procedures. Because most of the grid is not monitored for Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GIC), operators will be \u201cflying blind\u201d with respect to the state of the grid. Operators will not know which portions need remedial action and what actions will be optimal. Information gaps will exist as in August 2003 \u2013 where operators were unaware of the initiating tree contact. Sensors needed to monitor GMD/EMP stressors on critical grid components were not required by NERC standards and have not been installed. And this lack of visibility has led and will lead to errors in executing operational procedures.\n\n&gt; There is no control center with large enough visibility to control operational procedure response on a national scale. Lack of information on neighboring interconnections impairs proper procedural response. A national control/coordination center does not exist. And in the Eastern Interconnection, there is no single authority over the nine American regional Reliability Coordinators. Because the geographic coverage of solar storm GMD and nuclear EMP can be continental in scale, sup-regional control visibility and authority are necessary. At this point, only the federal government, using Presidential authority, can fulfill this role. \n\n&gt; Operational procedures have not been adequate to address the much simpler causes of previous large-scale blackouts. For instance, operational procedures proved ineffective in preventing the 2003 Northeast blackout that was precipitated by a single failure point \u2013 tree contact with a transmission line. Recent grid models indicate that GMD and EMP will cause hundreds to thousands of failure points. The complexity and rapidity of grid failure during a Carrington-class event will overwhelm the ability of electric utilities to respond and to prevent grid failure using any suite of operational procedures, no matter how well- conceived and practiced. During Hurricane Sandy, grid physical damage outstripped the effectiveness of procedural protection efforts. Physical damage to grid components will be a factor in GMD/EMP events as well.\n\n&gt; Unforeseen grid equipment malfunctions have greatly impaired grid operators\u2019 ability to respond during major blackouts in the past. Operational procedures during the 2003 Northeast blackout were greatly impaired by computer control system malfunctions and software problems. Critical grid state monitoring, logging and alarm equipment failed. The control area\u2019s SCADA and emergency management systems malfunctioned. The shut-down of hundreds of generators over multiple states was unanticipated as was the failure of tens of transmission lines. Confusion and inoperative control systems led to many frantic phone calls. As these events, show, any early failure of major grid components caused by the GMD or EMP environment will impede implementation of subsequent operational procedures.\n\nGreat.\n\nOkay well maybe these sorts of huge solar storms don't happen very often. But we know about [a big one that happened in 2012](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_storm_of_2012). It missed the Earth by about 9 days, as the Sun rotates around its own axis with a period of about 25 days. The only reason we know about it is because it happened to hit one of our sun-observing [spacecraft](https://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/where/where_is_stereo.gif). So it's really just a matter of time. \n\nOkay, so we can live for a while if the power goes out right? Obviously so. But only for a while. Our modern economy and food delivery systems rely on power and communications. \n\n&gt; \u201cIt\u2019s briefly dealt with in the commission report [of 2008]. There are essentially two estimates on how many people would die from hunger, from starvation, from lack of water, and from social disruption. One estimate is that within a year or so, two-thirds of the United States population would die. The other estimate is that within a year or so, 90% of the U.S. population would die. We\u2019re talking about total devastation. We\u2019re not talking about just a regular catastrophe.\u201d\n\nI couldn't find that in the report myself but I did find, \"An EMP attack could, in effect, temporarily create in the United States the technological conditions in the food and transportation infrastructures that have resulted in developing world famines.\" and \"The human consequences of such a scenario include the social and psychological reactions to a sudden loss of stability in the modern infrastructure over a large area of the country. \"",

A storm similar to the event mentioned above in 1859 would be really bad. As stated above, \"we\" can't shut the grid down to prevent disaster. But in a way, much of the grid has been fitted with smart relays that make it possible for the parts of the grid that have smart relays to shut those parts down before stuff gets too crazy.\n\nThe geo-storms (GMDs) and associated electro-magnetic pulses (EMPs) damage electronics by inducing electrical currents in places and directions they aren't supposed to be in or go. These currents can happen very quickly or very slowly, with rather small magnitudes or really, really large magnitudes. There are ways to protect circuits, but that usually involves metal cages and buildings and it is impractical for the thousands of miles of steel and aluminum cables strung all over the nature. Basically, the grid is vulnerable to this type of energy.\n\nGMDs produce long wave energy that could generate rather large currents in long distance transmission lines. A study done in the USSR on EMPs resulting from high altitude nuclear blasts showed that their test line pretty much burned up everything that was attached to it. This was a result of the large current surge. Modern smart relays will detect these surges within a few milliseconds and send the open command to the breaker in the substation, effectively cutting the connection. The whole process should be fast enough to prevent the large surge from passing through the substation busses and into the local grid. When smart relays trip, they are usually connected via secure comms to outside centers that are monitored, so they can communicate their current state back to base. If comms go down, they should still have done their job and been able cutoff the surge before stuff got too crazy.\n\nThe problem is that this is mostly a guess, though admittedly backed up with some really sound science. It's a guess simply because GMDs don't happen too often, thankfully, and one of the magnitude of 1859 hasn't happened since. The other way of generating large EMPs is to detonate a nuclear device at high altitude. There would be little to no radioactive fallout on the ground, but the energy released would quickly generate a rather strong and widespread pulse that could pose a threat to many thousands of square miles. These bursts produce different waves of pulses than a GMD, the first being a very fast, very high energy burst that would cause a lot of damage to small electronics within this threatened area, though its affect on the transmission lines would be negligible. These waves are akin to lightning strikes in both their time and energy frequency characteristics, though the wave from a blast would be more energetic. The smart relays fall into this category of small electronics, but the control houses in which they are installed within the substation should be protected from lightning strikes, and thus from the initial high energy wave from a high altitude nuclear blast. The other energy wave released by the nuclear blast would be the type that is very similar to GMDs as mentioned above.\n\nThe other reason this is a guess is that we simply don't know how strong of a GMD we could get hit with. It's effect on us is also largely dependent on our relative position to it in space.\n\n[Source](http://www.futurescience.com/emp/E1-E2-E3.html). Look into the included bibliography of that page as well.\n\ntl;dr - We're hosed, but maybe not as bad as it could be. The grid is pretty smart and getting smarter at protecting itself. Plus, a lot depends on the GMD and how we are positioned relative to it.",

You can see it for yourself if you tune an AM radio to an empty channel, then bounce a quarter off the two terminals of a 9V battery.  You can hear the radio pick up the EMP caused by the \"circuit\" rapidly changing from open circuit, 0 current, to short circuit, high current.  I'm sure that, if they wanted to, a researcher could build a test grid and some sort of long-wave EMP device to test possible solutions.\n\n\nGood electronic design can greatly reduce the effects of EMP.  The basic principle is simple, reduce the size and number of \"antennas\" available to pick up the pulses.  This includes keeping thru-hole components tight to the PCB and trimming the legs short, avoiding long trace runs, having good ground planes, etc.",

He said that in any given solar cycle peak the chance of a Carrington size event being directed towards earth was approximately 14%. Knowing that a solar cycle peaks every 11 years I responded \"So we're pretty much guaranteed to have one in the next 100 years\"\n\nHis response:\n\n\"Yep!\" \n\nHe cited the insurance company Lloyds of London study which found:\n\n&gt;A Carrington-level, extreme geomagnetic storm is almost inevitable in the future. While the probability of an extreme storm occurring is relatively low at any given time, it is almost inevitable that one will occur eventually. **Historical auroral records suggest a return period of 50 years for Quebec-level storms and 150 years for very extreme storms, such as the Carrington Event that occurred 154 years ago.**\n\n&gt;The total U.S. population at risk of extended power outage from a Carrington-level storm is between 20-40 million, with durations of 16 days to 1-2 years. The duration of outages will depend largely on the availability of spare replacement transformers. If new transformers need to be ordered, the lead-time is likely to be a minimum of five months. **The total economic cost for such a scenario is estimated at $0.6-2.6 trillion USD** (see Appendix).\n\nThat's up to 2.6 trillion USD and 2 years without power just for the US. Add in the extra chaos, cost and manufacturing backlog for a widespread wipeout and you can see how screwed we are. In case it wasn't apparent already say goodbye to every satellite in orbit as well.\n\n[Source for a good read](https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://www.lloyds.com/~/media/lloyds/reports/emerging-risk-reports/solar-storm-risk-to-the-north-american-electric-grid.pdf&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRyq6ewY7WAhVHv5QKHZNEB0UQFgglMAA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGp5RVqmG4axLHJ7F91I9Z1WKjB5A)         ",

We also have back ups, and we could hide some behind the Earth depending on how long it would last. The power infrastructure will probably be saved by NASA. They'll predict it and power companies will disconnect their power sources from the grid while it happens. It will result in a massive power outage but bringing the grid back online will happen a lot faster. There will be some pains from cycling so many systems at once; some equipment will be one cycle away from failing and instead of cycling them one at a time on a regular maintenance schedule, they'll all get cycled at the same time. But still, recovery will be much faster if the grid is taken offline during the storm.",

Its my understanting that a large storm would induce enough current flow to short out things like transformers and relays all on their own. Doesn't even matter if things are grounded if the ground wire can't handle the current. So we would have tens of thousands of devces to repair or replace even with warning, but it fully agree that a warning will help.",

Right now we are headed towards solar minimum (the aurora will not be as good for the next few years).\n\nCMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections) are what everyone is talking about, and these are also normal occurrences. They happen ALL the time with zero disruption to Earth. We have a plethora of satellites staring at the Sun to watch. These CMEs blast Earth with charged particles, and the Earth's [magnetosphere](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/educational/MagnetosphereWebPage_clip_image002.jpg) funnels a lot of them to the poles, where they twirl down the magnetic field lines. We see this on Earth as the aurora. All satellites in orbit use hardened electronics, while our electronics here on Earth are protected by the magnetosphere.\n\nEvery once in a while, a giant CME will hit Earth. These have the potential to cause disruption to power grids, generally in regions of the world closest to the poles. While this has caused major problems in the past by inducing currents in power lines and blowing up transformers, we now have an early warning system called [Solar Shield](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2010/26oct_solarshield) to predict and mitigate damage to infrastructure. Satellites such as [STEREO](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/spacecraft/index.html) A, [SOHO](https://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/), [ACE](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/ace/), and soon [Solar Orbiter](http://sci.esa.int/solar-orbiter/), can transmit data to computers on Earth to simulate damage and warn power companies in affected areas. Reaction times are roughly two to four days. The most accurate data comes right before the event reaches Earth, with a 30 minute lead time (from ACE). In most circumstances your personal electronics will not be affected, however bit error is more likely during solar events.\n\nThe problem is, as the power grid grows it becomes a bigger antenna and we have to rely on the power companies to respond appropriately.\n\nTLDR: you and your iPhone will be fine, worry about North Korea instead\n\nedit: added links",

There should be no physical scratches or scruff marks on either side of the filter. Try looking through the filter with a single eye before attaching to your telescope. Once it's on your scope, the magnification - in addition to a *damaged* filter  - can and *will* permanently damage your eyes. \n\nThat said, filters are a great way to tease out details in various objects. For day time, a typical White Light solar filter can be used which will replicate what you can see with solar eclipse glasses. There are specialized scopes that allow for H-alpha which is a much more detailed image.\n\nNight time filters include OIII or UHC, either of which, with varying degrees, can tease out details for nebulas and other gaseous deep sky objects. Additionally there's a light pollution filter for those within the city and moon filters since viewing a full moon can be *very* bright and straining on your eyes. \n\nBe safe and clear skies! ",

It helps to cut a hole in the middle of a pizza box top, and to put that around the objective (big) lens end of the telescope to create a shady area for the screen.  Point the telescope at the Sun, and voila! you can see the Sun on a screen without looking directly at it.\n\nIf you cut a ring from a PVC pipe and mount it on a 12\" stick at one end of the board, and mount a skinny 12\" stick (piece of bamboo tomato stake) in line with it at the other end of the board, you can adjust the height of the skinny stick so that it works like a gunsight.  Point the viewer toward the Sun and watch its shadow on the ground.  You will also see the shadow of the ring and the skinny stick.  When the shadow of the tip of the skinny stick is centered in the shadow of the ring, the Sun will be projected onto your screen.  It takes a little adjustment, but its easy to aim the viewer once you get it aligned.\n\nA good source of white plastic for the screen is a piece cut from the side of a plastic kitty litter jug.  White posterboard or foamboard will also work well.  The distance between the eyepiece and the screen will determine how big a picture you see of the Sun.  If you have the screen close up, you will have a very small image that is very bright, too small and too bright to look at comfortably.  If you move the screen back some, you can get an image of the Sun that is about 3 or 4 inches in diameter, and the sunspots will be easy to see very clearly, while the image will be bright, but not bright enough to make it hard to look at comfortably.\n\nThe good thing about the shadow gunsight is that you are always aiming by looking at the ground, instead of peeking over your shoulder to try to find the Sun's location.",

They're places where the Sun happens to be *very magnetized* right now.  The magnetic field in a sunspot is about 1-3 kiloGauss (about 2-6 thousand times more powerful than Earth's own field), over a region about the size of, well, Earth's entire surface area.  \n\nThe strong magnetic field prevents convection:  normally the surface of the Sun is heated by hot material rising up from below in bubbles about the size of Texas.  These bubbles are called \"granules\" because they look like granules of corn in a solar telescope.  Each granule rises to the surface; cools by radiating, well, sunlight; and then sinks again in about five minutes (!!!).  To do that the material has to move sideways to get away from the stuff coming up just under it.  In sunspots, the magnetic field prevents that sideways motion, stalling the convection and allowing the material to stagnate and cool.\n\nSunspots are themselves pretty damn hot -- about 4,000 Kelvin, which is plenty hot enough to be bright white.  But the surrounding solar surface is about 6,000 Kelvin, and glows even more brightly -- so the sunspots look dark by comparison.\n\nIf you go to the [Solar Dynamics Observatory's nowcast page](https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/), you'll see that the corona over the sunspots is particularly bright and (if you pay attention to the spectral information in those UV images) much hotter than even the rest of the ultrahot corona.  That's because the strong magnetic field penetrates into the corona, heating and containing it.  Watch over the next few days and you might see a strong solar flare happen there.",

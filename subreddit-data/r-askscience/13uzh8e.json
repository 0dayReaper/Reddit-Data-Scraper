In adults, these are normal percentages of different hemoglobin molecules:\n\nHbA: 95% to 98% (0.95 to 0.98)\n\nHbA2: 2% to 3% (0.02 to 0.03)\n\nHbE: Absent\n\nHbF: 0.8% to 2% (0.008 to 0.02) \n\nHbS: Absent\n\nHbC: Absent\n\nThere would typically be a mix of different types of hemoglobin within the 270 million molecules in a single blood cell.",

There are more than 1000 naturally occurring human hemoglobin variants but, since the large majority of those cause no beneficial or adverse effects, they are mostly ignored. The ones listed in the \"average human\" percentages above tend to be the ones that truly matter.",

Under the condition that the activity of CPIII is directly correlated to the number of bacteria and not to metabolic change due to chlorine exposure. Which is a reasonable assumption I think.\n\nedit: Maybe that is a premature conclusion. I  have read that seawater also alters the microbiome significantly, by the bacteria in the water themselves but also by washing off much of the microbiome. So it may be a shift that has a reason besides dying bacteria.",

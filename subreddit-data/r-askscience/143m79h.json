            "comment": "Couple of interesting facts about finger prints. \n\nFinger prints can be lost through plenty of ways, one of the more common ways of losing them is through abrasion like handling coarse paper all day like office secretaries in the 50s and 60s.\n\nYour finger prints are controlled exclusively as a byproduct of your finger development as a 6 week old fetus in the womb when your wittle fetus arms start sprouting what's called VOLAR PADS. These tiny pads are mounds of stem cells clump together beneath the skin of your hands called Mesenchyme and the development of these turning into your fingers are what determine the shape of your finger prints. \n\nAs your fingers grow they don't grow that the same rate. Sometimes one side grows faster than the other side. The volar pads as they  flatten and become more finger pad shaped they can become stretched. This is where your PRIMARY RIDGES form which if the volar pad (center of your finger print) is oblong and stretched, your primary ridges will form distinct loops that follow the shape of your VOLAR PAD. \n\nIf your Volar Pads aren't stretched or oblong during development your primary ridges will be relatively symmetrical looking and turn into a WHORL which is a inward leading spiral towards the center. \n\nYour Volar Pads can also flatten out so much that they're not prominent (most of us still have tissue remnants of our Volar Pads and they're like little squishy parts at the tips of your finger you'll notice them if you feel for them.  If your Volar Pads have flattened out then your primary ridges will form arches. \n\nFinger Prints can also identify family members because as they're controlled by your genes, a general pattern forms that can be traced back decades. However everyone has small differences and this is called the Minutiae which are like scars and junk and other tiny variations that can even tell you if you touched the wall of your mother's womb once during development.  along with other differences. \n\nIdentical twins don't even have the exact same finger prints interestingly enough!\n\nAs for finger print restoration, finger prints aren't just surface ridges. They're actually formed my microscopic indentations that go deeper into the  the dermis, these little depressions have cells called the Merkel Cell-Neurite Complex. These clumps of cells is what give you the ability to touch and all those little tactile senses. It's very hard to damage them  but it's possible. \n\nThese clumps of touch sensitive cells and neurons is what also causes your fingers to go wrinkly if you've been in water long enough. They send signals to your blood vessels to constrict and shrink to limit blood flow to those areas. Which is thought to help you feel things under water like if you were an ape searching around for snails or w/e because when your fingers go wrinkly it actually increases the friction and decreases the amount of force needed to hold onto things under water while also increasing your tactile sensitivity.\n\nAs for whether or not your finger prints will restore to the exact same or not. Yes. They also restore themselves even with scar tissue and this is because the microscopic depressions in your dermis. The only way to remove them is if you were to skin your finger down to almost the bone.",

Digital readers for these people are of little use; usually they have to use other parts of the palm for identification. \n\nFor deep scars a papilloscopist (dactyloscopy) will have an easier time identifying the fingerprints. This makes the fingerprint more unique.",

They do scar but that doesn't matter as the underlying pattern grows back just the same. The scar interrupts that pattern but there are usually enough unique identifiers, like bows and forks in the pattern that allow it to match older to newer prints. The scars are just additions to the rest of the pattern. Once the scar is on file, it provides a new unique identifier in someone's print.",

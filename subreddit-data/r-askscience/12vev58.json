It seems like viruses in particular would benefit from this, either coding for the checkpoint molecules directly or tricking the host cell into overexpressing them to tamp down immune responses.",

It looks like it mostly exploits the complement and innate immune system, but it's still certainly within the spirit of tricking the immune system.",

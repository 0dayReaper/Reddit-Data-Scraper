If you allocate a batch of tickets to each server, then you could end up denying tickets to people who connect to the \"wrong\" server when other servers actually do have tickets remaining.\n\nIt also isn't compatible with setups where you have reserved seating and let people pick where they want to sit from the remaining seats.",

Airline sites are like this, too.

You have different parts of your system which have different capacities, and behaviors that only show up in highly specific scenarios.  It would be one thing if there weren't a limited number of tickets, but there are.  \n\nAt the end of the day, almost every part of ticketmaster's system can operate almost totally decoupled from the rest of their site - except their central ticket authority.  If you have a master in one location, and replicas in others then people hitting the one location will have a much faster write (purchase) experience than in other locations, and potentially are looking at slightly out of date data (ie. buying a ticket which has already been purchased elsewhere), where in the central location that would never happen.  There are database technologies which allow master&lt;-&gt;master relationships between databases, but some of these problems still exist in that scenario.  And, even if they didn't, my assumption here is that ticketmaster's backend is on some type of tabular database like Oracle or MS SQL Server.  Transitioning from those to a whole new technology that is nosql is not trivial.  We're talking maybe years of work before they'd be fully done.\n\nAt the end of the day, ticketmaster really doesn't have to make any changes until enough venues/performers get fed up with them enough that competitors start becoming much more viable.  Once that happens, I bet you'll very quickly see a load of improvements.\n\n\n\n",

While I don't know about HBO's network specifically, you need your own logic etc to go over the top of CDNs so you know what you're handing off to when and where.  It's not quite as simple as 'just farm it off to a CDN' unless you want it to perform poorly.  \n\nIt's not hard to forecast bandwidth usage .. the second time.  The first time is an estimate. It's also not simply delivering a certain amount of traffic, it's also about delivering it in the right place.  Then it also becomes about understanding which links from certain providers have become saturated and affecting your routes to target networks (most clients send feedback so you know how often client buffers are emptying and thus video stops) so you workaround them by adjusting the way you advertise routes etc.\n\nIt's difficult to overstate just how big the traffic is for something like this. Hell, you can usually tell if someone died based on traffic graphs from the increased flow to news sites. One of my previous jobs we had a \"celebrity death\" alert for unexpected traffic across the CDNs for news sites.\n\nAnyway my point is that like most things it's a lot more complex than 'throw it on a CDN'.",

That's because those are just large files hosted on some CDN.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that most places don't host their own CDN, they pay someone else to, like Akamai.  I believe HBO uses Akamai, and Hulu definitely does.  Netflix used to, prior to a few months ago when they started their own CDN.  Steam uses a company called \"Highwinds\" (according to Google).\n\nIt's not really necessary for Akamai to \"forecast GoT bandwidth\", like mentioned in the top post, because even when GoT is streaming, it still makes up a tiny percentage of Akamai's overall bandwidth.",

IPv4 has a very limited set of addresses (in the grand scope--obviously there are a lot of IP addresses available).  One of the reasons we have private networks/firewalls is simply due to the number of IP addresses; this is why the IPv4 spec reserves certain networks (10.0.0.0/8, 192.168.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, etc) for private use, to ensure that the entire network can route things correctly.  Since multicast sends out packets to every address on a network, it isn't supported on the public internet, when firewalls (separation of public and private network resources through NAT) are in place which would block the multicast packets.\n\nIPv6, on the other hand, has so many available unique addresses that there is virtually no need for firewalling to reserve private IP space (to say nothing of the security aspects of privatizing your network).  That means that multicast across the public internet becomes a much more feasible possibility because (potentially) those private endpoints that would be receiving the multi class packets are no longer firewalled behind a NAT-device.\n\nedit: fixed 172.16 network mask, thanks u/omfgitzfear",

However, to address your question, it is possible for a site to spin up their own servers from a cloud service company to handle sharp increases in load. CDNs are very good at delivering static content but they wouldn't be able to help if the spike were due to a huge influx of user registrations or ticket purchases.",

The newest GoT season started with a spectacular failure of our largest cable provider's online platform - which was due to the fact that the authentication service couldn't handle the load. So all the video files were there, all the DRM keys available, but because no one could prove who they were, there was no playback.",

But there is a whole massive video processing infrastructure to even get to that step from the creator supplying the content. Content acquisition systems fetch the content from wherever it is generated (for GoT it is reasonably simple but for a complex live broadcast video will be being acquired from many places over many different technologies). Then there are the transcoding servers. And don't forget ad-insertion. And eventually some streaming servers. All before you get to the CDNs.\n\nThese are really big engineering projects -- each step involves large server farms, built around massive, fast storage.\n\nAnd sending the bits would be useless without the operational management, quality assurance and fault and performance management systems to make the whole lot work reliably.\n\nI don't know about HBO, but many broadcasters outsource playout to specialist companies you have never heard of. For example, my employer handles playout for a large European TV broadcaster.",

I believe they work out of CNBC's old plant in Ft. Lee, NJ. It's quite an operation and has really been a leader in the nuts and bolts of delivering streaming products and are very good at what they do.

Essentially their business model is to have a LOT of servers and bandwidth available at all times, and to sell that to many companies. Since no one company will have high bandwidth demands all the time the sum of spikes from different companies evens out for them somewhat. A big data pipe you (as company) can rent by the minute, so to speak, if you don't need it all the time.",

There were even some good attempts to commercialize this but Hollywood wasn't ready to buy into online distribution just yet. In the meantime CDN's we're growing to be able to service the needs of their clients and bandwidth prices came down so sharply that CDN's still own the market. I still think there's a great deal of untapped potential in p2p to be able to handle huge spikes in demand without adding much bandwidth cost for the distributor. \n\nFWIW, my HBOnordic crapped out all day yesterday and made GOT unwatchable until today.

They can get reimbursed in services from the content owner (say free stuff like extra content), or in micropayments of some crypto. It would be like a torrent, except monetized.\n\nIf it's cheaper for the content creators like HBO, they may be keen on adopting such a protocol, if it were to exist. And the savings (and/or earnings) could be passed on to the consumer as an incentive.\n\nThe only key piece is cryptocurrencies like Ethereum have to get more into the mainstream.\n",

            "comment": "&gt; Generally how do massive amounts of data get transferred from one source over shortly periods?\n\nIn most cases the service provider (such as HBO/ random website) relies on 3rd party cloud (internet) services that have a massive data centers across the country / world. What pretty much happens is when the data centers detects a massive increase of request it automatically clones your data and distributes your data across multiple servers. So pretty much you go from having 5 servers that are hosting your data to 500 servers. \n\nAmazon (AWS) is the number one provider of this kind of service. They figured since they need a massive network to run their business, they'll lease out their \"extra space\" and make some extra coin from it. \n\n*I could be wrong, however I know someone out there will politely correct me lol.

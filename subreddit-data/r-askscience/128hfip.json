    "postText": "I've been watching documentaries released \\~7 years ago about food waste in America. They criticized companies like Walmart for throwing out their leftover food rather than donating it or selling it at a discount. They said that when food is in landfills it produces methane, but if you compost it then it  won't. \n\nSo my question is: Could someone explain why one form of decomposition results in methane production but another does not? Are there other differences?",

Aerobic bacteria break down the organic matter and produce carbon dioxide.\n\nIt's about the presence of oxygen, which changes the bacterial environment, which changes the chemistry.\n\nMethane is a much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide in the next couple decades timescale.",

The ocean is getting warmer and more acidic, both of which slow the rate at which it can absorb CO2. Some of the CO2 dissolved in it vents to the atmosphere like a glass of soda going flat, and just like soda, ocean water goes flat faster when it's warmer. Also when the surface layer is warm, it's harder for colder lower layers to mix with it, resulting in a stratified warm layer of water that is saturated with CO2.",

Reducing the impact by up to 30% by extracting and burning biogas instead of releasing methane in landfills is a great idea.\n\nMoving away from natural gas and fossil fuels is a better idea as leakage is a huge portion of man made methane emissions.\n\nMethane basically comes from 4 sources. Feeding humans, food waste, feeding livestock, producing fossil fuels.\n\nWe can cut down on 3 out those 4 and we desperately need to.",

If it burns for only a minute, you might not need much more than paint. A few more minutes, you\u2019re probably looking at serious structural work. A few hours, there\u2019s no house left to save. \n\nThe point is, there is a time where simply ceasing the bad action is not enough, and you have to start intervening. We\u2019ve started a process of transforming our environment in ways that impact the planet on a global scale. Simply stopping what we\u2019re doing doesn\u2019t arrest the long term effects of what we\u2019ve done. Even if we stopped using fossil fuels, started cloning meat and stopped raising livestock, replanted all of the trees, and shipped all the trash to the sun tomorrow, it doesn\u2019t undo what has already happened. The world does need people to fix it. The earth as a giant rock in space is going to be just fine for a long time, but life on the planet may not survive if we don\u2019t. At least, life will look very different.",

If you've done any (aerobic) composting, you'll know that the compost can get quite hot indeed, to the point that on rare occasions it can become a fire risk.

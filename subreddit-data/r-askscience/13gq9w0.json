It is currently an ongoing field of research, for example from March: https://www.science.org/content/article/t-rex-lips-new-study-suggests",

                    "comment": "I don't think it's quite as debated as it used to be. Recently we've looked into the location of foramina (passages for nerves and blood vessels in the skull) and there's a lot of evidence that terrestrial theropods like T. Rex has foramina and pressure sensors along the jaw that would most likely have been used to sense movement in water when the mouth was submerged to alert of predators. The low amount of them would mean there was likely flesh covering the teeth. \n\nThen look at a spinosaurus, something we know submerged in the same way a crocodile does, and you see a huge amount of these formina on top of the jaw and snout but not on the lower jaw. Pair this with the narrow shape of the skull and density of the teeth and jaws and it would seem the spinosaurus had exposed teeth. \n\nThis would line up pretty well with what we see in extant reptile species.",

Afaik most extant reptiles barring crocodilians or vertebrates with beaks like birds or turtles, seem to universally have lips. It just makes sense too, since having your teeth exposed to the elements especially the air would seem like a good way to damage them. Crocodilians get away with this by being semi aquatic so they always have water to lubricate their teeth, but also regularly replace their teeth (although many reptiles with lips do this too). Even then, lots of fully aquatic animals still seem to retain some kind of protective covering for their teeth akin to lips. Big examples are fish, which hugely vary. Lips also provide important tactile information in addition to protecting teeth, as well as helping to keep food in your mouth.",

The reason they think it\u2019s true is because there\u2019s a characteristic pattern of wear for teeth that are exposed on the outside, like a crocodile, and T-Rex teeth wear is consistent with animals that have lips where all sides of the tooth are covered.",

There\u2019s all kinds of circumstantial evidence in play, from the aforementioned foramina to things like pits in the upper palates where lower teeth might have fit inside the upper tooth row. \n\nMost of the discussion focuses on theropods, but I find ornithischians fascinating. Ceratopsians and hadrosaurs had these massive chewing batteries and must have had cheeks to keep the food in the mouth during processing. Again, all circumstantial but a more accepted conclusion. I don\u2019t know if anyone has looked at oral/buccal foramina in these dinosaurs, but if not, someone should.\n\nOh, and they did shed teeth a lot. I personally found a tyrannosaur tooth beside a hadrosaur.",

The complex answer is evolution is a b\\*@%h to figure out. \n\nAs for the Tyrannosaurus Rex, it most likely had a scaly or reptile like skin and not feathers. As there was a skin impression of a T-Rex that did not show any signs of having feathers, but instead a rough textured skin similar to a reptile. **However**, there are other Tyrannosaurs that we know did have feathers, such as the Yutyrannus. \n\nIt is these finding of fossils of dinosaurs in the same family that start to cause the confusion on what they looked like. Because again, evolution is a b\\*@%h. &gt;!Birds are reptiles technically....!&lt; **^(Evolution!!!!)**",

That said, most bird feet remain scaly. Not to mention that their oviparous nature is strikingly similar to many lizards.",

    "postText": "As demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, settings like hospitals and nursing homes are highly susceptible to disease outbreaks. Recently, outbreaks of the fungus *Candida auris* havebeen reported in these locations. What makes these events so concerning is that *C. auris* is often resistant to standard antifungal treatments, spreads easily, and can be difficult to identify. What can be done to prevent a full-blown *C. auris* outbreak?\n\nJoin us today between 2 and 4 PM ET for a discussion, organized by the American Society for Microbiology, focused on the biological, clinical and policy aspects of preventing, diagnosing and fighting *C. auris*. We'll cover the science of what makes this fungal species so unique, talk\nabout treatment strategies and remedies, and share ideas for steps can be taken to prevent future outbreaks from happening. Ask us anything!\n\nWith us today are:\n\n+ [Rebecca A Drummond, Ph.D.](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/immunology-immunotherapy/drummond-rebecca.aspx) (/u/theRAD_lab)- Institute of Immunology &amp;amp; Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham\n+ [Scott Filler, M.D.](https://profiles.ucla.edu/scott.filler) (/u/Scott-1979)- Investigator, The Lundquist Institute; Professor of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA; Principal, NovaDigm Technologies\n+ [Jeniel Nett, M.D., Ph.D.](https://mmi.wisc.edu/staff/nett-jeniel/) (/u/Candida_biology)- Associate Professor of Medicine and Medical Microbiology &amp;amp; Immunology, University of Wisconsin\n+ [Peter G.

Candida auris is unusual in that it does seem to spread from person to person, likely through contaminated bed clothes or skin-to-skin contact, but as outlined above - actual illness will be limited by the health status of people exposed to the fungus.",

Candida auris is a good example of how problematic antifungal resistance can be. Unlike bacteria which can transfer resistance genes to one another (i.e. between cells), fungal cells can't do that so their resistance tends to develop from mutations that arise naturally and then pass through the population. This makes the development of drug resistance in fungi slower than bacteria. However, there is good evidence that fungi may acquire resistance to antifungal drugs in the environment, caused by the use of fungicide drugs in agriculture. There is an excellent article on this that I can recommend: https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/11/when-tulips-kill/574489/",

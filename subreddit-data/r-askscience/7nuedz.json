Some sharks (e.g. Squalus sp.) have special glands in their rectum which will secrete salts\n\nThere are probably other strategies as well",

It doesn't use a fish kidney, but it is a synthetic semi-permeable membrane that operates on the exact same principal.\n\nIt's not a solution to a drought problem because it's too expensive. You need high pressure high volume pumps and those RO filters don't last long when you hit them with seawater. \n\nIt's cheaper to build a thousand miles of canals and pumping stations to move that much water from the rainy part to the desert part.

The concentration of solutes (I'll just say salt) is much higher in the surrounding water than it is in their blood/tissues. Water flows from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. The concentration of *water* molecules in the cells is *higher* than the concentration in the surrounding seawater. This means the water is going to flow out of their cells, not in.\n\nSo the kidneys of saltwater fishes need to *retain water* and *excrete salt*.\n\n\nFreshwater fishes have the opposite problem. They do not \"drink\" because water is constantly flowing into their cells. They need to *retain salt* and *excrete water*. \n\nThis gets a little muddied when comparing mammals to saltwater *or* freshwater fishes because our kidneys need to retain salt *and* water. \n\nSo anyway, I'm just pointing out these complications. I'm mostly a fish person.",

They actively absorb new salt from their gills. They produce a urine that is nearly devoid of salt. They even use their anal glands, which normally excrete salt, to actually hold salt as a battery.\n\nThey are an animal that develops in brackish water. This leaves them exposed to both salt and fresh water for large portions of their development. \n\nThey are a relatively rare case however. As someone who's experienced in the aquarium trade there are very few other fish that can do the same. Some can only transition one way, with or without metamorphoses. Others can exist in brackish and one of the total polarities.\n\nInterestingly one of the few other fish that can transition fully between the two with only a gradual adjustment is mollies. One of the most common fish kept in aquariums.",

Cats live in some very dry areas (the middle east is where our domestic cats originated) and good kidneys allow you to conserve water.  Having good kidneys means cats don't have to worry about finding a lot to drink, and instead can live mostly on the water from their prey.  Camels can also drink salty water for the same reason, as can [kangaroo rats](https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/19501400724) which normally don't drink _any_ water in the wild.\n\nDrinking salt water for a lot of desert animals is more of a side-effect ability for animals adapted to conserve water in a dry climate",

The \"intro\" level explanation I remember from there is that there are two routes onto land from the sea for an evolutionary path to take - either go directly from the sea onto the beach and then move inland, or go from the sea to a river and then to the land from there.\n\nIf you take the former path then you keep the water-retaining systems of the original saltwater fish (e.g. insects, which produce mostly solid waste to conserve water). But with the latter route, your lineage goes through a period of adapting to freshwater, where you need to actively expel water and can use it freely to dilute your other waste. Then the land-dwelling descendants are stuck with trying to modify that system back into retaining some water (e.g. us)",

So these animals get the vast majority of their water from their food with the help of their super kidneys. They have another freshwater source called metabolic water, which is basically getting some water molecules as end products of various metabolic processes, but this is a very small component.\nSource: Am marine mammalogist ",

If they didn't actively pump salts into their bodies at the expense of energy, they would lose those vital salts. Resisting a diffusion gradient requires an expenditure of energy. (Such as wafting the fart back in the direction of it's source, or using fans to keep it from spreading.)\n\nSeawater fish tend to have body salinity far lower than that of the surrounding water, so they have to do the opposite - pumping salt OUT of their bodies.\n\nWith fish, they absorb water through their gills through osmosis, IIRC.",

Being able to pump salt in and out of fishes body requires \"machinery\" building which requires energy so for most fish it's advantageous to forgo this expenditure by just living in the water they are more suited to.\n\nHowever some fish (like salmon) can gain have advantage by differences in saltwater and freshwater environments so that extra energy expenditure is worth it.\n\nI'm not expert on the subject, but I suspect freshwater upstream ponds ecosystems aren't big enough to sustain big predators. This allows salmons to develop their young in relatively safe environment. \n\nOcean however has more abundant food so salmon can use ocean to grow faster and produce more offspring compared to fish that live all their lives on the ponds.",

I worked closely with her and she is one of the foremost experts on evolution and systematics of marine mammals. I will add personal clarifying results in [brackets].\n\n&gt;Most marine mammals are hypoosmotic; their body fluids have a lower ionic [salt] content than their surrounding seawater environment, and they are constantly losing some water to the hyperosmotic seawater in which they live.\n\n&gt;Marine mammals obtain the water they need from the food they eat: preformed water in their diet [as previously mentioned in this thread] and subsequent metabolically derived water [not previously mentioned]. Most fish and invertebrate prey consists of 60-80% water, and the metabolism of fat, protein, and carbohydrates provide metabolic water during the digestion of food. It has been shown experimentally that seals [also referred to as phocids] can obtain all the water they need from the food they eat. If seawater is given to seals, the stomach becomes upset and the excess salts have to be eliminated using body water. \n\n&gt;Despite this, seals occupying warm climates have been observed drinking seawater (King, 1983), a practice called mariposia. It has been suggested that intermittently consume small amounts of seawater at intervals that would not be enough to cause digestive problems, but would be sufficient for facilitating nitrogen excretion [peeing]. Mariposia is especially common among adult male otariids [sea lions and fur seals] (Riedman, 1990)\n\n&gt;Why do pinnipeds [seals, sea lions, fur seals, and walruses] drink seawater? Gentry (1981) noted that most of the otariids observed ingesting seawater live in warmer climate and lose water by urination, panting, and sweating. He suggested such water loss , along with prolonged fasting by territorial males, may be severe enough to promote the drinking of seawater. The behavior may play a role in nitrogen excretion by supplementing water produced oxidatively from metabolized fat reserves. Mariposia has also been reported for Atlantic bottlenose dolphins, common dolphins, and harbor porpoises.\nI'm getting tired of typing, but theres about one more page to go. I'll type it up if anyone wants to read more\n\n\nTL;DR\n1. Eat high water content food\n2. Metabolically produce water from digestion and fat reserves\n3. Kidneys stronger than desert animals",

Sea water is on average 35 parts per thousand salt, roughly double the maximum concentration our kidneys can produce. So if we drink seawater, our body has to pull extra water out of tissues just to get rid of all the salt that came with it. This is why drinking seawater results in a net loss of water for humans.\n\nIf an animals kidney is capable of producing urine that with higher solute concentration than seawater, then that animal can drink seawater just fine. The kidney of a kangaroo rat, for example, can produce urine with nearly ten times higher concentration of dissolved solutes than a human kidney is capable of. So the kangaroo rat could theoretically drink seawater with no problem. It's the same with marine animals.",

Removing salt from water is a pretty difficult process, which is why it's impressive how sea creatures do it so well by natural means.\n\nHumans can produce fresh water from sea water using techniques such as electrolysis, but this is costly as it requires a lot of energy. Simply put, using fresh water sources is much easier and cost effective. ",

We know many ways of doing it, but they all involve expending a considerable amount of energy, so we really only do it if we have to.\n\nThere are some (rather advanced) shortcuts you can take to reduce the amount of energy you need to use, but they tend to be slow and not very space efficient.",

Fish are very good at flushing salt from their systems and leaving the freshwater in their bodies which marine mammals eat. Imagine if you ate watermelon all day, you probably wouldnt get very thirsty because the watermelon has the water content you need to stay hydrated.",

Their job primarily is to keep salt content high relative to most intake. Sea creatures don't have this need and therefore don't have the same renal physiology. Interestingly some sea fish like the bull shark can alter their renal physiology to retain salt to go into fresh water. ",

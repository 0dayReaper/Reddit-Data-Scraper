            "comment": "I'm a data scientist who worked through large share of research related to increasing voter turnout. There is a host of research on related issues, but let's reframe the question a bit. We might start with \"to what extent does political advertising work\" and then ask whether it's a homogenous effect (it affects everyone more or less the same) or a heterogenous effect (it affects different people differently).\n\nThe good news is that voter turnout is a large experimental body and large random controlled trials are performed fairly easily. There have been a wide variety of experiments on different treatment effects showing different results, many of these summarized in the book [Get Out the Vote](https://www.brookings.edu/book/get-out-the-vote-2/). Some of these use deliberate [RCTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial) and others use [natural experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment). \n\nThese broadly show that standard GOTV methods are effective, but that their effectiveness is somewhat difficult to measure because it's always against a background of voter propensity. In a population where everyone votes, any turnout method has 0 effectiveness. In a population where many GOTV methods are already being employed, your particular treatment effect will be significantly less effective. In terms of price, a good vote-per-dollar effect will be around 300 dollars a vote. (So now you know what your vote is worth).\n\nFor this same reason, a large degree of heterogeneity is expected with respect to propensity. Someone who is already determined to vote cannot be encouraged to vote. Experiments to measure heterogeneity generally show that there is a population of \"discouraged voters\" with very low propensities who cannot be easily encouraged, and most of the efforts to increase voter turnout are for people with estimated propensities between 30% and 70% chance of turnout. \n\nSo we know that microtargeting using conventional methods are fairly effective and that targeting people based on propensity is fairly effective. But is this what microtargeting means? Not usually. Usually it means crafting the message to the individual, perhaps based on their particular psychology. So far, I haven't seen research that supports this kind of messaging is effective. In fact, the most effective messaging seems to be as apolitical as possible. When you orient your message towards politics, it seems to active people's defense mechanisms and a sense that they're being manipulated. I haven't seen evidence of any politically-oriented ads being particularly effective at engaging voters.",

It's not about swaying the vote one way or another (well, sometimes it is but it's really not that common), it's about making sure the people you want to vote are going to vote. It's incredible how little mind-changing there is. When the margins are so thin, where if every person voted it would be a few points shy of 50/50, it's really about activating your base and maybe convincing the undecided or weak votes. During the election season most of the messages we run are \"go vote.\" Not even for our candidate, just go vote. If you're seeing that message we already know who you're likely going to vote for (we still use candidate branding/logos but there's nothing explicitly stating to vote for X). You'll see some persuasion ads in the run up to the election season, so probably here in a few months, but once a certain threshold is crossed it switches to GOTV",

There are still voter awareness campaigns in Australia, but the total cost of all advertising and market research by the AEC was only $24.7 million AUD in 2021/2022 during an election year. This becomes $1.50 AUD per eligible voter for a turnout 30% larger! This cost benefit is something I hadn't considered as a benefit of having compulsory voting.",

They predominantly vote for incumbents or the major parties due to brand recognition - which only entrenches the incumbents and major parties even further, reducing their accountability to the voters even more. It's the exact same problem as voting for \"their team\" except worse because they don't even care (or know in many cases) what their team stands for, even ostensibly. A US Democratic voter would stop voting for a Democratic politician who campaigns to ban abortion. A compulsory voter wouldn't.\n\n&gt; We're not a democracy if there is a good chunk of people who do not see it worthwhile to vote.\n\nAnd pointing a gun to their head (or a less drastic measure to the same effect) won't change that. They'll vote, but they'll still consider it as worthless as ever.",

But is this what microtargeting means? Not usually. Usually it means crafting the message to the individual, perhaps based on their particular psychology. So far, I haven't seen research that supports this kind of messaging is effective. In fact, the most effective messaging seems to be as apolitical as possible. When you orient your message towards politics, it seems to active people's defense mechanisms and a sense that they're being manipulated. I haven't seen evidence of any politically-oriented ads being particularly effective at engaging voters.\n\nAs far as I know, political microtargeting is basically just targeted advertisements most commonly digital ones.\n\nGenerally it's true that apolitical ads work the best because you want to motivate voters to get to the polls without motivating the opponent to the polls in a \"counter-vote\".  Isn't this the point of targeted ads though, where controversial takes that motivate one type of person is only seen by those motivated by it in order to prevent that type of counter-voting by those who lean towards another party?\n\nTrump is a good example of the type of rhetoric that encourages counter-voting.  Typically, it's advantageous for the House of Reps when the other political party controls the Presidency - however, their performance was far below expectations.  NPR articles have largely pointed towards Trumps rhetoric as being one of the primary causes - that strong rhetoric only appeals to his base, but his public speeches appear to have fired up Democrats more, where Republicans that Trump endorsed lost at a much higher rate than those he did not.  \n\nIt's avoiding counter-voting that is the primary advantage of targeted ads - do you have any info on this in particular?",

It only takes *one* person to create the perfect political ad, and it might not be known to academic research.\n\n[This paper](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/sciadv.abc4046) I found gives a fairly typical result.\n\nThere's much more to be said, particularly how all this relates to social psychology, but I wanted to focus on results from RCTs because I find them to be good research studies in this area instead of going full theory-craft.",

Was the first time in 25 years Election Day calling felt like I was really doing something (as opposed to trolling for 2 votes, which we do anyway \u2018cause you never know). \n\nSadly the DCCC has effectively abandoned field work in favor of digital only. But that\u2019s another story.\n\nAlso I should clarify, what we didn\u2019t isn\u2019t \u201cadvertising\u201d. It was direct voter contact.

Over recent years, changes to various tech platforms' advertising policies, paired with more restrictive privacy protections on networked devices, has made hyper-precise targeting much more difficult than it used to be. \n\nThat all said, in the United States (where the practice is most mature and pervasive), all major political campaigns and parties engage in \"microtargeting\" to some degree and have the capability to measure its efficacy. \n\n[Daniel Kreiss at UNC](http://hussman.unc.edu/directory/faculty/daniel-kreiss) has done a lot of work on political technology and communication, if you are really looking for an academic perspective.",

If you can define and segment the individuals on the list accurately and your data includes enough PII to match a good match to the ad platform data - you\u2019ve effectively got \u2018personalized\u2019 targeting. \n\nThis was why the theft of the DNC records was key to Russia\u2019s election interference. They needed good list of PII that included each individuals baseline political beliefs so they could develop strategies to further skew/amplify these beliefs.\n\nCombine that with a progressing sequence of ad messages and you\u2019ve got a powerful tool to walk \u2018specific\u2019 types people down the rabbit hole of a chosen version of reality.\n\nBTW - to me the biggest concern with this technology is not manipulating people to choose a specific option.

Before the controversy they were brazen about their methods. \n\nTo share my own opInion as a former digital strategy head at an agency, I think that specific targeting on behaviors and traits was successful in the Cambridge Analytica case, but this has since been shoehorned into other cases without regard for validation. Most advertisers lack the resources to execute with the same sophistication, the use case to be so selective about who to target or not, and the discipline to follow some semblance of a scientific method vs. selling snake oil to clients/superiors.",

Very similar imagery oddly is used to sell ideas just at an inverse. A good start would be double spesk by william lutz just because its an introduction to said concepts. Theres several titles on marijuana prohibition or even the Zoot Suit riots in Los Angeles. Simply put political language doesnt just influence voting behavior but behavior. A good thing to look into would be what local candidates were using as a platform they were and how they spoke or invoked imagery. Good luck and have fun!",

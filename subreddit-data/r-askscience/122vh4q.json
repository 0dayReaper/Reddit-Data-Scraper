    "postText": "Every time I try to research about lions, tigers, leopards and other big cats, I get so many conflicting answers about where they came from and which species was there first. \n\nFor example: I have read that Cheetahs, Lions, leopards originated in Africa 3-4 million years ago, and after migrating to Asia, tigers evolved from leopards and only continued to migrate northeast and north west and never went to Africa. \n\nHowever, elsewhere I have read that tigers evolved first slightly over 2 million years ago from snow leopards, and lions and cheetahs did not evolve until after that in Africa, eventually having lions come to Asia. \n\nThere are even more conflicting theories with dates differing in the millions, does anybody have a source that can answer this question with more accurate and research information? \n\nTLDR; What continent and time period did big cats originate, who came first to earth, tiger or Lion?\n\nThank you!",

            "comment": "There has been a lot of debate about big cat relationships over the last century but this is the popular consensus from modern genetic analysis:\n\nCheetahs are not closely related to big cats. They're far more closely related to housecats and cougars, that entire group diverged from big cats way back around 6.7 MYA.\n\nThe big cats first split into two groups: Tiger/SnowLeopard and Jaguar/Lion/Leopard. This happened about 3.9 MYA.\n\nThen, Jaguar split from Lion/Leopard about 3.6 MYA. It's theorized that the jaguar's ancestors crossed the Bering Strait in Russia to reach the Americas. (You have to remember, lions used to have a much farther spread into Europe and Asia than they do today).\n\nSnow Leopard and Tiger split about 3.2 MYA.\n\nLion and Leopard split only 2 MYA.\n\nNone of them were first. In evolutionary terms, that's like asking which of your cousins was your grandmother. Even trying to figure out which species the ancestors most closely resembled on a superficial level involves a ton of luck finding specimens and a healthy dose of guesswork.",

            "comment": "This will necessarily be a very broad generalization. \n\nAll else being equal, in the US, since the start of the pandemic, of all people ages 70-79 who have tested positive for COVID-19, about 8% die before recovering. In other words, 92% survive. \n\nThere are many more variables than just age. Men with the virus are more likely to die of it than women are. Underlying conditions such as diabetes, heart failure, and obesity are linked to worse survival rates. Survival is better now than at the start of the pandemic because we have learned some treatments that are effective, and some other things that we should avoid doing. \n\nAlso, the above percentage only refers to deaths. There are other possible long-term effects. Even a relatively mild case can cause permanent damage to the heart, lungs, and blood vessels. The most severe cases can leave patients ventilator-dependent or with brain damage from lack of oxygen. So, \"survival\" may not be the best metric to pay attention to.",

                    "comment": "Even then, it's worth considering what triggered the positive diagnosis.\n\nThere will be many 74-year-olds who have had Covid but were never tested - whether their symptoms were mild to non-existent, because they refused testing, or because there were no tests available. Where the test is prompted by exposure, rather than concern for the individual's health, the unadjusted odds of survival will be significantly above 92%. Nonetheless, it's likely that the number of undiagnosed cases in 74-year-olds will be smaller, as percentage of the total, than in the population at large, because of the greater likelihood of severe symptoms.\n\nOn the other hand, as you say, any weight gain, cardiovascular issues, or diabetes, would also depress the survival rate.",

This finds previously undetected, asymptomatic and mild cases. It possible to find the risk associated with an infection (not a diagnosis). \n\nThe IFR in Donald Trump's age group is indeed several %. \n\nIn the UK, the IFR among people 65 to 74 is 3.1%.

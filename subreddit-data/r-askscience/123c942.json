    "postText": "I understand that drinking a large amount of water in a short amount of time can potentially lead to other issues caused by upsetting the balance of electrolytes in our body.\n\nI'm more curious about the long term effects on our kidneys when drinking large amounts of water throughout the day. I'm assuming this results in our kidneys having to work harder than usual, so that makes me wonder how that impacts their long term health.",

However, this was pretty extreme, she was chugging it back and it totally unreasonable rate. So I might not recommend for example trying to drink 12 gallons of water one day, because you might die. But unless you're drinking insanely crazy amounts, you're not at risk\n\nHowever if you do find yourself continuously thirsty and drinking a lot more than seems normal, you might go see a doctor. Excessive thirst can be a side effect of poor kidney function or high blood sugar. Amongst other things.",

So despite what people tell you , you absolutely can drink too much water.  Is it likely for a person not insane?  No.  But yeah....it can happen.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt doesn't hurt your kidneys, but can give you heart attack and other similar.  You can make it worse by drinking distilled water, as it will leach more minerals from your body.",

There's a risk of dying in a car crash when you drive and there's a risk of dying in a bicycle accident if you decide to ride your bike instead, but you're only ever taking on one of those risks at any given time. One risk completly REPLACES the other, depending on the decision you make.\n\nCovid however, is an ADDED risk in addition to every other decision you make daily. Sorry if I wasn't being clear.",

            "comment": "Initially, in a biological substance like wood or meat, there will be chemical substances like water or light organic molecules within the mix of chemical substances. As the temperature rises, these will boil off at their respective boiling points. At a higher temperature, pyrolysis will take place, where complex organic molecules break down, with the chemical structure of the molecules coming apart and the different elements ending up as different, simpler compounds. The result will be a bunch of steam, nitrogen, hydrogen and other light molecules, and a solid core of carbon graphite. This is essentially what happens when you burn wood into charcoal, you drive off the lighter compounds and reform the wood into near pure carbon. Eventually, if the temperature is high enough, the carbon will melt, but that happens at a very high temperature indeed.",

No air gets in. This is then encased within a second, well-ventilated metal tin with the gap between the two tins filled with more wood chips, which are then ignited.\n\nThe interior can is \"cooked\" when the exterior can is burning. This generates a lot of gas from a relatively small amount of wood, without choking the engine with carbon dioxide, smoke, ash, or the flames smothering themselves by being starved of oxygen for too long. The engine is being fed a delicious, clean mixture of methanol, butane and other flammable goodness.\n\nSo from the outside, it looks like a barrel of wood burning. But inside, it's a tad more complicated. \n\nIn the late war, the Germans had training tanks fitted with this technology, specifically to reduce the fuel costs of training tank crews.",

That burner is massive and heavy, range is terrible, and you're generally just getting terrible efficiency from the whole process.",

You bring the ore to the fuel, not the other way around.  Not only do you need an order of magnitude more fuel than ore, the fuel is less dense, and so very bulky to transport. I learned the hard way just how big a pile 10 tons of charcoal is. And then got to shovel a bunch of it.  This means the smelting furnaces have to be quick to build because you rebuild them and move on to the next fuel source frequently (at least until we get much farther in the future with canals delivering coal and such).\n\nOur test was only tangential to this stuff. We were testing if a faster method of building the smelters gave equivalent results. Because if it did, you could do experiments more efficiently. In the end our method (fire brick structures coated in location appropriate materials) produced essentially identical results. You'd still need to build some the real way to verify, of course.",

So as impractical as moving the charcoal is, it's not even an option; either you bring the iron to the fuel, or you have to bring *the raw wood* to the iron, and that's an extra order of magnitude harder than the already-terrible idea of moving the charcoal would have been.\n\n(also that sounds pretty cool, ngl)",

Hemicelluloses are the component most sensitive to the thermal treatment, but lignin and cellulose are also affected to some extent. Ether linkages (especially \u03b2-O-4) in lignin are cleaved and new free phenolic hydroxyl groups are formed. The methoxyl content decreases and the new reactive sites on the aromatic ring can lead to further condensation of lignin [[15], [16], [17], [18]]. The amorphous regions of cellulose are susceptible to thermal degradation (similar to hexose components of hemicelluloses), but the crystalline regions of cellulose are very stable and degrade at the temperatures above 300\u202f\u00b0C (depending on the time of treatment, environment, sample size, etc.) [[19], [20], [21]].\n\nWood degrades more rapidly when heated by steam or water [22,23]. The thermal modification processes are conducted mainly in a dry environment in an inert gas or in a moist environment with steam to decrease oxygen availability. Under these conditions, the hemicelluloses are hydrolysed, and the crystallinity index of cellulose increases, but lignin is only slightly affected [24]. The pyrolysis of hemicelluloses, a process that should be avoided, begins at about 270\u202f\u00b0C, followed closely by the pyrolysis of cellulose [25].",

            "comment": "Charcoal is what you get when you heat wood in the absence of oxygen.\n\nEssentially, all of the non-carbon stuff melts and vaporizes, and what's left behind is the carbon husk.\n\nCharcoal is super useful and important in early human technological advancement.\n\nIt's porous. All of the places in wood that used to have not-carbon stuff are now empty. This makes charcoal extremely porous and excellent at absorbing and trapping chemicals, particularly hydrocarbons.\n\nIn gas vehicles gasoline can vaporize in the fuel tank, especially on warm days, and that increases the pressure in the tank and can literally burst them. To prevent that, we need to vent the tanks, which means letting precious fuel vapors escape. That's lost fuel AND it's pretty damn terrible for the environment. In comes charcoal. We make the vent pass through a canister filled with charcoal, and the charcoal absorbs the fuel vapors, letting clean air vent in and out. That's why your car doesn't perpetually smell like gas when stored in the garage. The charcoal is like a sponge. Later when the engine is running at operating temperature, it seals off the canister and applies a vacuum, which sucks up all the fuel vapors into the engine to be burnt, recovering the fuel as useful energy and essentially wringing out the sponge.\n\nCharcoal can also used as a coating or integral part of air filters to help remove odors in the air, as the odorous chemicals are absorbed by the charcoal. \n\nCharcoal is also used in emergency situations like overdoses of certain medications. The patient can be made to ingest crushed charcoal, and in their stomach the charcoal will bind with the active medication before it gets a chance to get into the blood stream. Effectively lowering the dosage taken.\n\nAside from its ability to capture hydrocarbons, charcoal is also just pure carbon and can be used as a fuel.\n\nOne reason charcoal may be preferred as a fuel instead of using wood directly is because you can get a far hotter flame from pure charcoal.\n\nEven dry wood is full of moisture and other compounds that will vaporize off, and whenever these compounds melt and vaporize, they steal some energy in their latent heat of vaporization. This robs a lot of heat from the fire. Even if the total energy recovered could be higher with wood (lots of the volatiles are also combustible), it requires a larger area to completely combust them all, and they combust in the gasses above the base of the fire (that's why a bonfire can have a very tall flame). The energy is spread out over a much larger area, so it's not as hot at any location. You'd be hard pressed to successfully smelt any meaningful quantity of metal ores in a wood fired furnace, let alone re-melt enough to do useful metalworking.\n\nWith charcoal, there's no volatiles left to evaporate, so there's no heat loss to vaporization, and much more of the combustion can occur in a small area provided enough air (oxygen) is provided, resulting in a high concentration of energy and very high temperatures. The higher temperatures of a charcoal furnace enable us to do more useful things with smaller furnaces. The inside of the furnace can get hot enough for smelting and forging iron.\n\nYou can technically do the same with meat, but meat has less of a carbon backbone than wood's cellulose structure, so you'd be left with a far lower density material and far less useful product.\n\nBone would be a little better, but I'd have quite a few questions for anyone who had bones in a more plentiful supply than wood...",

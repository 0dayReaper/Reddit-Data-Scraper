            "comment": "They don't. Invasive species are often highly inbred.\n\nInbreeding isn't a magical death ray. Sometimes inbreeding is really bad. Sometimes it's not so bad. There are conditions that can make some populations relatively resistant to inbreeding-related problems (for example, flushing recessives due to long-standing, mild inbreeding). \n\n&gt;However, it has been suggested that a population can be purged of the genetic load responsible for reduced fitness when subjected to bottlenecks...Following the founder-flush phase, the isofemale lines, with a large flush size and a history of inbreeding depression, recovered most of the fitness lost from early inbreeding, consistent with purging. \n\n--[Purging of inbreeding depression and fitness decline in bottlenecked populations of Drosophila melanogaster](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1420-9101.2001.00303.x)\n\nOr, the invasive species may suffer from inbreeding depression, but the benefits of a new low-competition environment may outweigh the problems, and the invaders adapt. \n\n&gt;Specifically, we suggest that a temporary or permanent release from stress in invaded habitats may alleviate the negative effects of genetic depletion on fitness via I \u00d7 E interactions, and present published empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis. We additionally discuss that I \u00d7 E interactions can result in rapid evolutionary changes, and may even contribute to adaptation of invaders in the absence of high genetic variation\n\n--[The Genetic Paradox of Invasions revisited: the potential role of inbreeding \u00d7 environment interactions in invasion success](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/brv.12263)\n\nOr, the inbreeding depression may be purged as the invasive species spreads. \n\n&gt; However, under certain theoretical conditions, bottlenecks of intermediate size can actually purge the alleles that cause inbreeding depression.... Thus, rather than posing a barrier to invasion as often assumed, bottlenecks, by purging deleterious alleles, can enable the evolution of invaders that maintain high fitness even when inbred.\n\n--[Inbreeding depression is purged in the invasive insect Harmonia axyridis](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822\\(11\\)00124-2)\n\nAnd of course, we mainly see the small number of successful invaders. It's very likely that there are many failed invasions that we never notice, because the inbreeding depression prevented a successful new population.",

If there are no harmful recessive genes, then inbreeding isn\u2019t a problem. \n\nHow do you get rid of harmful recessives? There are a handful of ways, but in general they all lead to exposing them and eliminating the carriers, at a rate that doesn\u2019t damage the population as whole. For example, long periods of low-level inbreeding help with this, or (as in the paper I cited) brief periods of intense inbreeding followed by outbreeding again.  \n\nSo if you start with individuals who have been through this sort of purging of recessives, they may have a better chance of tolerating more intense inbreeding, as with many invasive species.",

If one or two of a small group of founders of a new invasive population have an unusual trait then it will tend to be common within the new population, whereas it might have gone unnoticed within a larger population unless it had a significant impact on fitness.\n\nThe invasive population of black spiny-tailed iguanas radiating out from Gasparilla Island in Florida are omnivorous throughout their lives. This is almost unheard of among black spinies in their native range. That whole population is descended from two or three released pets. One of those former pets was probably just an oddball.

However it can grow through gaps in concrete and cause damage by exerting pressure and causing structural damage. \n\nhttps://www.phlorum.com/blog/2019/04/25/can-japanese-knotweed-grow-through-concrete/\n\nFemale/male clones\nWeird in that the same organisation where i sourced my i fo also says male clones on their page! Other pages say female. So I think again your correct but looks to be some misleading info out there!\n\nhttps://www.nonnativespecies.org/non-native-species/information-portal/view/1495\n\nIn terms of cost though. I'm finding Info saying  JK costs annualy 165m per annum\n\nhttps://butterfly-conservation.org/sites/default/files/1.bc-position-statement-on-buddleia-updated-2015.pdf\n\nWhereas other info is saying B is only circa 1m? \n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-30366-9#:~:text=The%20global%20annual%20cost%20of,year%20in%20the%20UK4",

The same people don't give a hoot about, say, grey squirrels in the UK - mainly because grey squirrels are so cute and totally don't spread disease and eat eggs and nestlings and small trees.\n\nThe cost is probably due to go up as JK is still on the spread as it's so easy to propagate, and unfortunately many places are so good for it to grow.",

Then you have bananas aka the Cavendish variety so inbred that it's unable to reproduce anymore, all banana plants have to be from clones. English cucumber is another one both the cucumber and banana are unable to be planted to make a new plant, for the same reason being that they have been selectively bred to the point where there seeds just...don't.",

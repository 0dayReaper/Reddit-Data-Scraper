            "comment": "The [scale height](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_height) at which gases appreciably concentrate to differing amounts is large. You have to have a very tall container of 100 of m or many km to see the lighter gas molecules start to concentrate near the top. \n\nNote though that this is not separation like oil and water. With oil and water the liquids would be modeled as strongly interacting and the dissimilar interactions create a distinct separation of phases. With gases, you can safely assume no interactions and treat each gas individually. You can create an [exponential decay](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barometric_formula) in pressure with height or each molecule of your mixture, with some decreasing slightly faster (having a smaller scale height) due to being heavier.",

            "comment": "The water would remain water rather than separating into hydrogen and oxygen (it would try to vaporise though; as the pressure in the vessel increased it would elevate the boiling point of the remaining liquid; it might well explode). The water vapour would mix with nitrogen, oxygen and anything else in the air that was present; you wouldn't get layers of different gases.",

            "comment": "Let's say your sealed vial of water was very very strong, and starts fully filled.  If you started raising the temperature, the pressure inside the vial would rise, but since the vial is sealed it would not have room to convert into a gas.  Instead the pressure and temperature would continue to rise.  Past a certain temperature and pressure it becomes a supercritical fluid where liquid and gas are pretty much the same state.  But it's still just water.  The hydrogen and oxygen don't separate.  Keep heating it even more and eventually it becomes a plasma.  At that point the hydrogen nuclei and oxygen nuclei separate and along with the freed electons become this soup of hot particles.  But they still don't separate into distinct layers of oxygen and hydrogen.",

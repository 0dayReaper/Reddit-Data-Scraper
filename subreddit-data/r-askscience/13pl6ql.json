                    "comment": "Thanks for the question!\n\nWe know that aging normally causes a decline in our declarative memory, which is the conscious recollection of facts and events (stuff we can \u201cdeclare\u201d in words). Within the category of declarative memory, our episodic memory (about our life experiences and events) is typically more impacted than our semantic memory (facts about the world).\n\nBy some measures, the average 80-year olds can remember about half as much as they could when they were 50.\n\n(Interestingly, our procedural memory, which is our long-term unconscious memory of how to do something, such as riding a bike, is typically not as affected by aging.)\n\nAs we age, our [brain normally shrinks](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/02/28/brain-aging-childhood-teens-adults/), including in the [hippocampus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4050197/), which is important for episodic memory. Our cortical areas also appear to get less selective responding to information (this decreased neural selectivity is called [dedifferentiation](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/39/1/149.full)), which is associated with worse episodic memory. Our neural circuits become less plastic and able to form new connections, which could make it harder to encode, consolidate and retrieve memories with age.\n\nBut it need not be this way! There are actually three major possible trajectories for our memory as we age:\n\n\\- There\u2019s the pathologic trajectory, where cognition gets worse faster than expected, like in dementia. Unfortunately, aging is the biggest risk factor for developing dementia \u2013 an estimated 1 in 3 Americans older than 85 have Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the most common form of dementia, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\n\\- In the average trajectory, our ability to remember things still diminishes. Still, there is remarkable variability in memory ability. (And aging brains can still [retain a lot of plasticity.)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.31887/DCNS.2013.15.1/dpark)\n\n\\- The third trajectory are the SuperAgers, who are people older than 80 that nonetheless have memory that is as good, if not better, than those in their 50s and 60s.\n\nI recently wrote about what [SuperAgers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/04/13/superagers-brain-cognition-dementia-longevity/) can teach us about cognitive health.\n\nTheir brains appear to be more youthful, particularly in areas thought to be important for memory and executive functions. Researchers looking that their brains found they had healthier and larger neurons in the [entorhinal](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/42/45/8587.abstract) cortex, a memory center, even compared to younger people. They also had a thicker [anterior cingulate cortex](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-international-neuropsychological-society/article/abs/superior-memory-and-higher-cortical-volumes-in-unusually-successful-cognitive-aging/206608D731A33A0B3CB63AF305FDBDDB), which is important for memory and attention, as well as denser amounts of [von Economo neurons](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010945217303611), which are believed to be important for social affiliative behaviors.\n\nOf course, some of it is just luck of the genetic lottery, and true SuperAgers appear to be rare. The researcher I spoke to estimated less than 10% of people that they screened qualified. But studying these SuperAgers does provide some insights into what they and their brains are doing differently.\n\nFor one, they appear to be more resilient to change and stress, which is something we can all train to be better at. They also manage to make enduring social relationships, which is not only generally good for our health but also provides a lot of novel stimulation that could help keep our brains young.",

                    "comment": "I think this answer depends on the method they are using!\r\n\nIn your example of a person in a brain scanner, you can get correlations of brain activity\\* to specific behavior or stimuli. They might present the person a picture (testing for vision) or ask them about what people might be feeling in a social scenario (testing for empathy) and see what parts of the brain light up.\r  \n\\*Note: these neuroimaging studies do not necessarily tell you the brain activity directly either! fMRI, for example, actually [measures blood oxygenation](https://www.open.edu/openlearn/body-mind/health/health-sciences/how-fmri-works), which is correlated with neural activity.\r\n\nAnd you are right that they could be thinking about some random thing! To control for this, they have to compare the brain activity for the task they are looking with a background condition, such as them just laying in the scanner doing nothing\\*\\*.\r  \n\\*\\*Note: Our brains are never doing nothing (while alive). The brain\u2019s [default mode network](https://neuroscientificallychallenged.com/posts/know-your-brain-default-mode-network) is a set of brain regions that were discovered to have an increase in activity when the scanner subjects were \u201cat rest\u201d. (I wrote about this brain network\u2019s involvement in mind-wandering and [shower thoughts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/01/12/shower-thoughts-creativity-brain/).)\r  \n\\--\r  \nWe can also use techniques to turn on or turn off specific populations of neurons and seeing what happens. If you activate the visual cortex, and the person reports seeing something, then that is a clue it might be \u201csufficient\u201d for something visual. If you can reduce the activity of a brain region or even surgically remove it, and that impairs the function you are looking at, that is a clue that area is \u201cnecessary\u201d for it. (These types of experiments are much easier in animal models than humans.)\r\n\nThere are always caveats and limitations to these techniques, just as with all science, so it is good to think about what uncertainties there are.",

I think that\u2019s the go-to explanation for many other scientist-turned-science-communicator so you aren\u2019t alone!\n\nI went into graduate school with the dream of becoming someone like Carl Sagan, but for neuroscience; I wanted to do cutting-edge research, teach students and also write books for the broader public.\n\nBut, as you know, research can be HARD and also tedious. For example, I was not especially great at troubleshooting why my electrodes were not picking up the neural signals in the mice I was trying to record from, and I did not especially enjoy making hundreds of brain slices by hand (it hurts to be hunched over for so long!).\n\nWhat I did love was learning about all the great research I was learning about and sharing it with others. I loved the discussion and trying to figure out how disparate fields and ideas may connect with one another. But today\u2019s research environment necessitates specialization, which meant I had less and less time to read about research outside my narrow subfield, let alone in completely different fields.\n\nLike you, I found much joy in talking about science with others. In college, I had volunteered by teaching science experiments to elementary and middle school students. And in graduate school, I founded a [science policy and advocacy group](https://www.jhscipolgroup.org/) and also wrote for the campus blog. These experiences helped me learn how to talk about science in a less obtuse way than you find in scientific journals \u2013 so it is great you are already doing this too.\n\nI also took a class about writing for a lay audience called Writing About the Brain taught by Professor David Linden (who also did an AMA a few years back). It should have been a sign that this turned out to be my favorite course in all of graduate school.\n\nBy the middle of my graduate training, I knew I wanted to do something other than research when I grew up :P\n\nIn 2018, my fifth year as a graduate student, I had the opportunity to attend a [science writing workshop](https://sciwrite.org/) in Santa Fe which solidified my decision to go into science writing. It was there that I found all these widely curious and knowledgeable and passionate people \u2013 my people.\n\nI then attended some science writing conferences (the [National Science Writers Association](https://www.nasw.org/) hosts the largest one, but there are also ones organized by regional groups such as the [DC Science Writers Association](https://dcswa.org/)). I was basically trying my best to meet and talk with others in the field, which is always the best way to start.\n\nSo \u2013 because this already overly long \u2013 I basically started pitching stories to editors, which is basically sending them emails describing research I wanted to cover and hoping they would give me the chance to. I also had a part-time job lined up at the International Arts + Mind Lab writing for their website, which gave me both practice and money to figure out how to make it as a freelance science writer.\n\nI kept putting myself out there sending these cold pitches and built up relationships with editors who ended up liking my work, which gave me more opportunities to write and get better. It was a virtuous, if difficult, cycle.\n\n\\--\n\nSo, my advice is to get practice by just doing more of it. There are many avenues to getting more of this practice, including writing for a student or school publication, or even submitting to science writing competitions. ([The Lasker Foundation](https://laskerfoundation.org/education/essay-contest/) has a big one every year.)\n\nYou can even pitch stories to publications, some of which ask for pieces by scientists, such as Scientific American, The Conversation, Aeon or American Scientist. Many science magazines publish shorter \u201cfront-of-book\u201d pieces of 300 words or less that you could write for.\n\nFor other scientists who want to go into science writing, check out the [AAAS Mass Media Fellowship](https://www.aaas.org/fellowships/mass-media/apply), which embeds current or recent researchers into a newsroom for a summer to learn by doing.\n\nThere are also a bunch of science writing programs out there to get formal training. [The UC Santa Cruz program](https://scicom.ucsc.edu/) specifically takes former scientists.\n\nFor more concrete tips, I highly (and I mean HIGHLY) recommend checking out [The Open Notebook](https://www.theopennotebook.com/2015/06/16/from-science-to-science-writing/), which is an amazing resource for learning more about the craft of science writing and communication. It has a pitch database, so you can see what other successful letters to editors looks like (and the resulting publication), as well as many helpful interviews and articles, including one on transitioning from [science to science writing.](https://www.theopennotebook.com/2015/06/16/from-science-to-science-writing/)\n\nI have also compiled some science writing resources I personally found helpful on [my website (where you can also see some more about my background if you want to become even more of a Richard Sima completionist).](https://richardsima.com/resources)",

The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, in turn, is thought to be involved with pain suppression and emotional control. Depression may also be a [key area](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006322319315574?casa_token=EmrSK2bzzM0AAAAA:MlcFvp1Getfk3g3VYR2SqFbFc1WjkF1I7poGHG5wkdH3lG_hQJlhN040OHTpBRA2Nhsi5yW-fA) involved in depression.\n\n[A 2022 study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-022-01949-3) reported that, for people with depression as well as pain, there was less activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which may mean they are less able to reduce this pain perception.\n\nDepression can also involved [impaired reward processing in the brain](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0149763421001962), which could predispose someone to respond to stress or pain maladaptively.\n\nInflammation may also play a role in contributing to both pain and depression.\n\nI recently wrote about how, for a subset of depression patients, [inflammation may be a driver for depression](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/02/23/depression-brain-inflammation-treatment/). One person\u2019s depression is not necessarily the same as another\u2019s (this is partially because we still define the mood disorder by its symptoms as opposed to its underlying biological causes), which may explain why for about 30% of depression patients, the standard antidepressant treatments don\u2019t work well.\n\nInflammation is produced by the activity of our immune cells, which can release inflammatory agents into the bloodstream to help fight infection. But for some people, this inflammation can be chronic (which is also associated with more pain.)\n\nThere\u2019s recent research showing that the inflammatory factors can make the blood brain barrier leakier, which can cause neuroinflammation. This in turn could alter brain circuits involved with feeling reward, such as the nucleus accumbens, leading to specific symptoms of depression like anhedonia (lack of pleasure).\n\nTargeted anti-inflammatory treatments (the researchers are emphatic in saying that these should not be taken without talking with your doctor) could help manage inflammation, but so can other lifestyle changes we know help depression and pain: exercise, less inflammatory diet and good sleep.",

Think of every great feat of mind and body (which the brain controls!) that has ever been done \u2013 launching rockets to the moon, creating vaccines, browsing Reddit \u2013 the brain can somehow do it all. I wrote about how I felt just so much [awe holding a brain](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2022/09/15/awe-mental-health/) and thinking about all its power and potential (and, to get meta, its ability to feel awe.)\n\nMore specifically, I think the amount of neuroplasticity that is possible still baffles me. I mean, there are [infants who can lose large swaths of their brain but still function and thrive afterwards](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/perinatal-stroke/2022/01/21/7347c514-3903-11ec-91dc-551d44733e2d_story.html). Mind-boggling!\n\n\\- There are so many open questions about the brain it is hard to pick! For me, I do wonder why we need sleep \u2013 we know it helps us repair, clear out brain junk, make new memories etc \u2013 but we do some other animal species need so little?  I\u2019m also curious about general anesthesia and how it makes us go unconscious\u2026 and how our brains can somehow reboot afterwards.\n\n\\- I believe you are referring to this study which reviews studies showing how diminished serotonin does not directly cause depression (aka the serotonin theory of depression). The thing is, most researchers who study depression already knew that the serotonin hypothesis was not accurate for at least a few decades. For one, SSRIs immediately start increasing the amount of serotonin available, so why does it take 4-6 weeks before the person taking it feels any of the antidepressant effect? Shayla Love wrote this [excellent piece about the study for Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/88qge4/the-new-study-on-serotonin-and-depression-isnt-about-antidepressants-chemical-imbalance) (RIP). I would say that we do know [a lot more about depression](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/02/23/depression-brain-inflammation-treatment/) now, but you are right that there is still a lot holding us back, including the fact that it is diagnosed by symptom instead of underlying biology. (Did you know that from the nine symptoms, there are 227 possible combinations for being diagnosed with major depressive disorder?)\n\n\\- Usual simple-but-difficult tips are at play here: get exercise, get sleep, eat healthily. But I would also say, get more nature! We recently did this lovely story about how [bird song may help our mental health](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2023/birds-song-nature-mental-health-benefits/) (complete with audio and images). These are all things we can practice doing better. For more brain health tips, please check out [The Washington Post\u2019s Well+Being](https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellbeing/mind/) coverage!",

But even without bleeding, you might have damage to the brain\u2019s white matter, which are the axons that connect neurons in the brain to each other. This could disrupt the brain\u2019s connectivity networks.

So if we are not conscious of what we are doing when boredom strikes, we can fall into this instant gratification trap.\r\n\nInstead, we can use boredom as an opportunity to reflect on and remind ourselves of what other options are more meaningful.

Any time a disease starts to massively increase in prevalence among a genetically diverse group with similar environments, you should be asking yourself about the potential for evolutionary mismatch, and therefore what social or environmental changes are responsible for the mismatch.\n\nConsider, as a parallel, the gargantuan increase in myopia among children in East Asia. Even before COVID and the shift towards remote learning, [myopia rates in secondary school graduates were approaching 90%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4941141/#:~:text=2%2013%E2%80%9315%20In%20contrast,be%20undergoing%20this%20myopic%20transition.), which is insane, and virtually precludes a non-environmental explanation. So, we can either target this in a way reminiscent of ADHD pharmacotherapy, by prescribing higher and higher prescriptions and optical drugs and laser eye surgeries to teenagers, etc, *or* we can distill what kind of stimulus is causing so many people to experience a similar disease, which in this case turned out to be a severe and chronic lack of exposure to sunlight and viewing distant objects at regular (ie circadian) intervals. Lo and behold, you run the regression and myopia in Asian schoolchildren decreases with time spent outdoors in a dose-dependent fashion.\n\nNow, of course myopia is not ADHD, but we are approaching a 15% lifetime incidence for men (only ~4.1% of women), and given that temporally it lines up almost perfectly with the onset of a severely perturbed developmental experience for boys, and that the drugs involved are massively more invasive and fraught with adverse effects than glasses or lasik, excluding the mismatch explanation out of hand is naive, especially in light of just how poorly executed and fraught with bias and financial conflicts of interest the body of clinical research on ADHD pharmacotherapy really is.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33085721/",

If imprinting or memories can vary by how/ when/ the degree of an event, wouldn't traumatic events have a stronger imprint therefore experiencing those memories and emotions more viscerally (please correct me if this if I'm wrong), what part of the brain stops a person from recalling it?\n\nI get dissociation plays a big part (or does it? ) in imprinting and retrieval but what barrier is stopping those memories from being able to be retrieved? How do things like hypnosis (possibly EMDR) manage to breach those barriers sometimes and allow those memories suddenly become 'concious' \n\nSorry if none of that makes sense :/",

I've never seen any evidence that learning more languages ever has a detrimental point. And I can't see why it would. The cognitive benefits of learning multiple languages are probably there but they're also fairly minimal. \n\nOne benefit maybe actually a bit of resiliency from the effects of old age are developing dementia. It sdds a bit of cognitive reserve. \n\nThe reason why it's harder to learn a language when you're older is because of the decreases in neuroplasticity. Certain aspects of language have a critical period for learning. This critical period Is kind of soft for some things, I'm like actually learning the language in syntax, but can be quite strong for others, such as learning to separate different sounds or make those sounds properly. \n\nSo if you start learning a language as an adult, and that language has phonemes that don't exist in your native language, you're going to really struggle to understand and make those sounds.",

Like what physically happens inside the brain when we are trying to understand a concept and then suddenly it \"clicks\", and we are like, \"Ah yes, now I understand\"? Does brain take time to create neural pathways, and when it has finally created a pathway between two regions, we are then able to understand/comprehend/make sense of a new concept?\n\nI hope you somewhat understood what I am trying to say.",

I get frustrated with the fact that majority of people, including the physicians who refer patients to me, don\u2019t understand how pain actually works in the body.\n\nI want to educate people on it, but pain is a complicated subject and there are so many misconceptions about it. It\u2019s hard to reach anyone outside my direct patient population or my co-workers. I would love to see the more mainstream media discuss this.",

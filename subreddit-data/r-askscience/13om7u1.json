            "comment": "External psychological forces have been known to be influential on others. Empathic neurology via mirror neurons can trigger endorphins (think babies when they see a person genuinely smile). Also, people's group think can be highly influenced by the \"hype\" of others. So i believe it is correct to say that groups can definitely influence the release of endorphins and hormones in others, but it's a double edged sword as endorphins and hormones such as oxytocin, while primarily thought of as promoting \"good feelings\" can also influence how we process negative emotions and have been shown to increase violence and antipathy when individuals are confronted with people considered \"outsiders\".\n\nEdit: The original question was in regards to self esteem and i seem to have left that unaddressed. I think the feeling of strength in numbers as well as everything I posted previously can influence ones sense of self-esteem through endorphins, hormones, and a sense of belonging, but whether this translates into individual, self actualization within an individual that carries on after removing oneself from the group is not something i am aware of having been studied. Perhaps someone can research academic literature on the subject and find a research paper with more evidence. However anecdotally, i think you can view those who come from healthy and supportive families that encourage one another as a type of evidence to support this idea.",

In the northern hemisphere, carbon dioxide levels peak in April and May, and then decline through the growing season to reach a minimum in September and October.",

            "comment": "Oh, man, have I got some cool data to show you.  First, the Keeling curve: \n\nhttps://scripps.ucsd.edu/bluemoon/co2_400/mlo_full_record.png\n\nThis is the amount of carbon dioxide measured at Mauna Loa, in Hawaii.  You can see the gradual rise of CO2 due to human fossil fuel burning, but you can also see that it wiggles up and down every year.  This is due to the growth cycle of land plants.  [Every spring and summer](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/bluemoon/co2_400/mlo_two_years.png), they grow new leaves, sucking up CO2 from the atmosphere.  And every fall and winter, the vegetation dies and decays, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere.\n\nWait a second, when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, it's summer in the south!  Why don't the two hemispheres cancel out?  Because the northern hemisphere has lots of continents, with land plants whose growth depends a lot on the seasons.  The southern hemisphere is mostly ocean, and ocean plants don't care about winter vs summer as much.\n\nNext, I want to show you the oxygen curve:\n\nhttps://scrippso2.ucsd.edu/graphics-gallery/o2n2-graphics/mlo.html\n\nIt looks like the exact opposite of the CO2 curve, because when humans burn fossil fuels and make CO2, it uses up oxygen, and when plants grow they suck up CO2 and make oxygen.  But not much: there's so much oxygen in the atmosphere that it changes by less than 0.01% over the course of a year.  So don't worry, this is too small for you to notice.  Worry about the CO2.\n\nNext, a computer simulation!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SgmFa0r04&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE&amp;feature=emb_title\n\nThis is a supercomputer simulation of changes in CO2 levels in the Earth's atmosphere over a year.  Red indicates more CO2, clear/blue is less.  You can watch as CO2 is emitted from human population centers and from regions of decaying plant matter, and then sucked up by plants in the spring and summer.\n\nAnd finally, real-world satellite data!\n\nhttps://ocov2.jpl.nasa.gov/media/documents/Orbiting-Carbon-Observatory-2-OCO2-XCO2-Atmospheric-Carbon-Dioxide-Concentrati_8uImYZ1.mp4\n\nThis shows data from the OCO-2 satellite, which is monitoring CO2 levels.  It's not as pretty as the computer simulation, the satellite only tracks CO2 along its orbit, not globally, but you can see the same patterns playing out here as in the simulation.",

            "comment": "Absolutely.  Look at a time series plot of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere of a \u201cpristine\u201d environment where there is no significant local sources of fossil fuel co2.   You\u2019ll see an annual cycle caused by photosynthetic uptake by plants in the northern hemisphere.  This is caused by the large spring and summer uptake of co2 and the relatively larger land mass in the northern hemisphere\u2019s sphere.",

The animations basically show higher CO2 concentrations through colder months and then the plants start growing and drawing in the CO2 in spring through fall.",

The difficulty is not that there\u2019s no normal (what we\u2019d call wild type), but because \u201cabnormality\u201d has no strict definition. Must it have a clinical phenotype (do you have to be able to see / measure it without a genetic test)? Must it be penetrant (that is, how often do people with the variation exhibit the associated phenotype)? What\u2019s the cut-off for the frequency of the variation to be considered abnormal (there\u2019s a convention that single nucleotide variations with a frequency of 0.01 or greater are \u201ccommon\u201d)?\n\nIt\u2019s less that \u201cthere is no normal\u201d than \u201cabnormality isn\u2019t sufficiently qualified to give a good answer\u201d. \n\nThat said, a simplistic answer might be to search ClinVar (a registry of clinically relevant genetic variations) for polymorphisms that have the highest frequency below 0.5 (above 0.5 they are more common than not, which is arguably normal).",

If you are thinking about ones with a phenotype rather than just polymorphisms I think cystic fibrosis is the most common inherited disease in \u2018Western\u2019 countries. As for variants that are not diseases as such, I\u2019d guess the mutations that cause paler skin are pretty common.",

Trisomy 21 is the genotype, but the way that genotype results in observable traits, presenting in the cluster of correlated traits we label Down Syndrome, that is the phenotype.\n\nTechnically, any observable trait resulting from the interaction of genes with the environment is a phenotype. I believe that commenter is drawing a distinction between common polymorphisms, \u2014 e.g., attached earlobes, hair color, melanin levels, the gene that makes cilantro taste like soap \u2014 and phenotypes which we might consider a state of disease or disorder.\n\n\u201cAbnormal\u201d isn\u2019t really a useful science/health term, but whether something has negative impacts  on your quality of life is typically what moves it towards being classified as a disorder.",

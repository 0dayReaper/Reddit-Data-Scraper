This means they can tolerate the viruses without getting hurt by them. \n\nBats also have some unique genes that help them limit inflammation. These genes are only found in bats and not in other mammals.\n\nhttps://theconversation.com/why-bats-dont-get-get-sick-from-the-deadly-diseases-they-carry-55012\n\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190226112401.htm",

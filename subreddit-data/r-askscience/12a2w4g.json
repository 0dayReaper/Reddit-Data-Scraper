    "postText": "We were taught in elementary school that the reason gas is amorphous is because the molecules are really spread apart. The reason solids are hard and can\u2019t be moved through is because the molecules are packed together. \n\nWe\u2019ve all heard that 99% of an atom is just empty space, and atoms make up molecules. \n\nSo with all that empty space, what\u2019s stopping the molecules from getting closer together?\n\nAdditionally, as something gets colder, it\u2019s volume shrinks. Hot air will rise above cold air. We were also told that was because the molecules are moving faster. So theoretically, a molecule can reach absolute cold and be able to be packed right up next to another molecule, without that 99% of space, right?",

            "comment": "You're confusing a couple different things here. \n\nFirstly, molecules are made of atoms. Atoms are made of protons, neutrons (we're gonna ignore those), and electrons. The electrons buzz about around the outside of atoms, kinda like a cloud or a lot of airplanes over a planet. They don't like to be near each other. When we talk about anything touching anything else (from atoms to molecules up to planets and stars), what we're really describing is the electrons from one thing getting close to the electrons from another thing and the electrons getting annoyed enough to push back and say \"that's it, we're close enough.\" We interpret that as touching.\n\nGases have lots of space between the molecules because the molecules are traveling very fast and bouncing off of one another. \n\nWhen we say something like \"99% of stuff is actually empty space,\" we're talking about the space in between the electrons (the clouds/airplanes) and the protons (the ground in this metaphor). The electrons are farrrrr away from their protons. We can't push them closer together. The only thing that can are the biggest of the biggest star explosions, which create something called a [Neutron star](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star).",

But this is close to what happens in the sun: push two protons close enough together with insane amounts of energy (a proton is just a hydrogen ion) and they'll become helium, releasing a bunch of energy in the process. In the end they're a new thing though (one helium atom instead of two hydrogen atoms). \n\nYou can keep doing this to make any atom you want. That's what the [periodic table](https://cdn.britannica.com/45/7445-050-BB332C27/version-periodic-table-elements.jpg) is, keep pushing protons together and you'll keep making new atoms (read it from left to right).\n\nWe can actually do this on Earth, very carefully with a couple atoms at a time in some of our most advanced research facilities. Or there is a faster way you might be familiar with, it's called a [hydrogen bomb](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Castle%20Bravo.jpg).",

Unionized atoms are neutral, so at larger distances feel no repulsion from each other. Repulsion only becomes significant when the electron clouds approach each other. Nuclei without electrons would repel each other from a great distance.",

My thinking was something like: If you could remove the electrons from an atom, then push those atoms right up next to each other, that would basically remove volume limitations for moving large masses of stuff around. Like, if you needed to ship a couple tons of some not-very-dense metal, then just rip the electrons out and smush it all together and now you have a ridiculously dense but low-volume of stuff to ship. Could also work wonders (if you managed to figure it out) for heat storage, or even electrical conductors in supercomputers. But there goes that idea XD",

More than 99.9% of an atom's mass is found in the nucleus, which takes up only a very tiny fraction of the volume of the atom. The reason that this doesn't mean you can pack atoms and molecules very densely is that mass isn't what stops atoms from getting close to one another. What stops atoms from getting close to each other is called Pauli repulsion, which says that the particles that make up atoms, like electrons and protons, can't be in the same space unless they spin in opposite directions. If you try to push two electrons with the same spin together, they strongly repel each other.\n\nNow, this does allow electrons to share the same space if they have opposite spins, and this is how covalent bonding works. If you take two hydrogen atoms and push them towards each other, the electrons will end up in the same space, but with opposite spins, and the two atoms will be bonded together into a single hydrogen molecule, and the electrons will belong to both nuclei equally. However, there are still two distinct atoms, because the atomic nuclei still electrically repel each other, and can't get closer together. If you pushed *really* hard, you could get them to get closer and closer until eventually they merged too, but this is just describing nuclear fusion.",

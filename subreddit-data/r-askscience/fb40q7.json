(The [initial rate was 2.3%](http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51), but it has evidently dropped some with better care.)  And if so, how does it compare?  Would it make flu season significantly more deadly if it isn't contained? \n\nOr is that even the best metric?  Maybe the number of new people each person infects is just as important a factor?",

First, it can kill healthy adults in addition to elderly people with existing health problems. The data so far suggests that the virus has a case fatality risk around 1%; this rate would make it several times more severe than typical seasonal influenza and would put it somewhere between the 1957 influenza pandemic (0.6%) and the 1918 influenza pandemic (2%).\n\nSecond, COVID-19 is transmitted quite efficiently. The average infected person spreads the disease to two or three others. That\u2019s an exponential rate of increase. There is also strong evidence that it can be transmitted by people who are just mildly ill or not even showing symptoms yet. This means COVID-19 will be much harder to contain than Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which were only spread by those showing symptoms and were much less efficiently transmitted. In fact, COVID-19 has already caused 10 times as many cases as SARS in just a quarter of the time\u201d",

Tons of diseases kill you because of immune overreaction, that\u2019s not remarkable at all.\n\nInfluenza virus does something weird with your immune system where your adaptive immune response is skewed to versions of the flu that you\u2019ve seen before. This is called imprinting, original antigenic sin, or the hodgkin\u2019s effect. The reason is killed more young people than old people was because young people\u2019s immune systems did not respond appropriately to that particular strain of H1N1 because their immune systems were accidentally responding to the wrong flu virus.\n\n(this is a simplification)",

This is believed to be because it replicates much faster so essentially triggers everything all at once and then causes cytokine storms in those with stronger immune systems (generally young people). However, in another study in mice, they discovered that if the immune response was controlled the mice then died because their system was overwhelmed by high viral levels. So, like many viruses, replication is probably the best target for treatment as it would also moderate the immune response.",

It basically hit most of the planet within the space of a couple months (~Aug - Nov of 1918) and everyone got sick all at the same time, so there was no 'preventing' the spread, as everyone was already sick. The book discusses a theory about how a mild form of the virus that spread earlier that year may have had something to do with it, but from what I know about viruses (degree in Immunology &amp; Infection) I don't think they work like that.",

Notably, it killed the young and healthy more than it killed the elderly. \n\nThat said, I corresponded with John Barry who wrote The Great Influenza about the 1918 flu, and he himself clarified--\n\n&gt;Over-all case mortality #s were almost meaningless. different groups had vastly different rates. according to metropolitan life #s, for example, even in the US case mortality for factory workers aged 18-45 was at least 10%.\n\nSo 1918 flu was extremely serious and the oft-cited CFR of 2% really understates the deadliness.",

It would tremendously increase the fatality rate of simple illnesses as well. For example, the current U.S. flu season hospitalized 280,000 people.

The US healthcare system is optimized for maximum profit, that means minimal spare capacity, 100,000 additional patients nationally will overwhelm the system, if the patients are in a specific geographical location (California) then the local system is tanked in about a week.",

I can\u2019t find the numbers right now but increasing the number of patients a nurse cares for pretty drastically increases the mortality rate of hospitalization. \n\nThere is some basic info in the link below but I can\u2019t dig up better sources right this second. \n\nhttps://www.nursingworld.org/~49ebbb/globalassets/practiceandpolicy/work-environment/nurse-staffing/safe-staffing-literature-review.pdf",

We have already seen in China, and we saw with both Ebola and SARS that one of the largest groups impacted was healthcare workers.  If your staff are getting sick you will have difficulty covering the increase in patient population.\n\nOne of the lessons from Ebola was that we do not adequately train staff in donning and doffing of PPE resulting in increased infection, two of the people infected in the US were Nurses.  We also learned in the SARS outbreak that improper use of respirators will result in infection, I think we are about to rapidly relearn those lessons.",

I don\u2019t work bedside anymore, but I\u2019ve been building alerts for our electronic charting system at a crazy pace to help standardize the questions asked on admission and then flag providers when a potential infection comes through the doors. \n\nWe as a nation are not well prepared for this.",

It can transmit when people aren't feeling symptoms or at least significant symptoms.  \nThey wouldn't even know that they need to stay home and quarantine themselves.  \nCouple that with places like the USA where way too many people can't take time off work to quarantine themselves.  Not even accounting for those that can't afford to see a doctor.  \nIf CORVID19 takes off in America.  Well.  Good luck. \nYou can either bankrupt yourself on a maybe, or risk society.  \nChoose.",

Today an article came out that said people in CA, WA, and OR tested positive without being around anyone sick. This is because many people probably get the virus but don\u2019t get sick at all, or don\u2019t get sick enough to go to be seen by a doctor. Therefore, among those with more severe symptoms, the CFR is above 1%. If everyone in the world got this infection, I do not believe 1% would die. \n\nIt\u2019s not that we shouldn\u2019t take it seriously, but it\u2019s probably about the same fatality as the flu, but we are just better at identifying those cases at this point.",

Raw numbers give 3.4% currrently, but outside Wuhan this seem to be lower.\n\nDeaths/(Deaths + Recovered) will overestimate the true fatality rate, because time to die is shorter than time to recover. In the beginning this was probably 100% because no one had recovered yet, and now it's 7% and sinking daily.\n\nBoth methods will approach the true fatality rate asymptotically, the first from below and the second from above.",

With virtual certainty, these will be biased high because not everyone who is infected will seek out care, such as mild cases, and those that do may never be tested.\n\nAlternatively, quarantine measures can also exert a range of different and potentially competing effects. In one case, quarantine isolation measures which limit contact with others lead to lower estimates of CFR. Unless of course the quarantine measure is some dense collection of (a few) sick and (mostly) healthy or otherwise non-infected people, such as a cruise ship or the newly built quarantine apartment building in Wuhan. In this case, there's a perverse incentive to evade detection or be noncompliant with quarantine orders, or it's possible that the dense environment allows a particularly infectious disease to a rapidly spread to new hosts who would otherwise have never become infected.",

            "comment": "This is a quickly moving pandemic - our knowledge of the virus is shallow and its potential to evolve with time is greater than 0. That said, the initial outbreak in Hubei province allows for a detailed breakdown of mortality by age and sex. The following comes from [a paper in the China CCDC weekly](http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51) that evaluated 72,000 case studies, along with about [56,000 case studies from the World Health Organization](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/#ref-2) (WHO). The full integration and interpretation of these two sources can be found [here](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-age-sex-demographics/). A partial summary follows.\n\nBy age:\n\n|Age|Death Rate|\n|:-|:-|\n|80+ years|14.8%|\n|70-79 years|8.0 %|\n|60-69 years|3.6%|\n|50-59 years|1.3%|\n|40-49 years|0.4%|\n|30-39 years|0.2%|\n|20-29 years|0.2%|\n|10-19 years|0.2%|\n|0-9 years|no known fatalities|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd by sex:\n\n|Sex|Death Rate|\n|:-|:-|\n|Male|2.8%|\n|Female|1.7%|\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt is unclear why men and women are affected, but an intriguing possibility is an X-linked gene that creates the ACE-2 receptor, which is exploited by some coronaviruses to enter cells. Females are XX, while males are XY, meaning they only have one copy of the gene and a subpopulation may be more vulnerable. Primary research can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-020-0147-1) and [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41368-020-0074-x), with a more accessible summary [here](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/why-some-covid-19-cases-are-worse-than-others-67160) This matches a similar pattern with the 2003 SARS outbreak, where 13% of females died while 22% of men did.\n\nThe origins of the virus are unknown, but genetically it is [very close to a similar virus in pangolins](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00548-w), which unfortunately are poached for traditional medicinal purposes. While it is not definitely known where the virus comes from originally, it is most likely an episode of zoonosis - where a virus spreads to a new species from another. Many human pandemics have their roots in animal transfer, including influenza (chickens), Ebola (chimpanzees), HVI/AIDS (chimpanzees again), measles (cattle), among hundreds of others. If you are interested in the history of these kinds of disease species jumps, I recommend [Spillover](https://www.amazon.com/Spillover-Animal-Infections-Human-Pandemic/dp/0393346617) by David Quammen.\n\nMy background is as an archaeologist, and I've been researching the emergence of epidemics for the past few years (no pubs on the topic though, sorry). If you are interested in this too, I recommend William McNeill's [Plagues and Peoples](https://www.amazon.com/Plagues-Peoples-William-H-McNeill/dp/0385121229). Historically, diseases seem to have gone through an initial high mortality phase, followed by a more contagious phase. This is only an hypothesis - and by a non-specialist at that - but I wonder if the SARS to COVID-19 infections follow that pattern. The difference being that a modern medical system can isolate the more lethal first step (SARS). Unfortunately, for more contagious diseases (like COVID-19), only massive containment measures are likely to be effective. Not all governments are capable (or willing) to do this.\n\nLastly, some may read the low infection rates for young people as a reason not to worry. As a parent of an infant, I take some solace on them. But keep in mind that even if you get a mild infection, you may spread it to someone you care about who will have a much harder time with it. While masks (N95 or greater) may be effective at preventing contamination, the most effective measures will be simply hygiene like frequent showers and washing your hands thoroughly. WHO recommendations for hygiene habits to reduce disease transmission can be found [here](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public).\n\nLastly, I caution agains the [normalcy bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalcy_bias). It is easy to assume that this will blow over like so many other supposed crises have. But the only comparable disease in the modern era is the [1918 influenza epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) that infected 500 million, and killed 40-50 million. If the numbers from Hubei are representative of the infection (and keep in mind - that is with extraordinary containment measures), then a 2.8% mortality infecting 500 million today would be 14 million people. It is unknown how international travel through airports and crowded cities of 10+ million will factor into this pandemic - we don't have a historical precedent for that. We also don't have a precedent for how pandemics interact with modern medical systems. There are a lot of unknowns. Wash you hands.\n\nI hope this helps. Stay safe everyone.\n\nps. sorry for the weird text changes, wrote this in markdown first, which did not turn out well",

But you also can't divide by the number of cured because those infected may yet survive. The point is, the only correct way of calculating the fatality rate is to wait until the dynamic effects wear off, and we reach the steady state infection rate. \n\nProfessional virologists have access to some impressive, highly sophisticated modeling software which considers the limitations I mentioned above and beyond. They seem to be going with 1 - 3% HIGH end mortality rates. I consider these estimates to be conservative, but nonetheless within the realm of possibility.\n\nAnother factor to consider is the novelty of the virus. Due to containment efforts, and the aforementioned dynamic response, the current healthcare system is overwhelmed. This superficially adds to the mortality rate as we can expect persons to have reasonable access to healthcare during steady state.\n\nSo in conclusion, the most reliable \"back of envelope\" calculation you and I can make will be a gross estimate. But it can be done. Deceased / Cured will give an extremely conservative estimate during early dynamic states. Consider week one had a few deceased and no cured. This method leads to a mortality rate of infinity percent! As time goes on, it will approach a more stable mortality rate. In contrast Deceased / Infected could potentially be completely erroneous. Overall, it lacks meaning during a dynamic state for reasons mentioned previously. It doesn't add much at steady state either as a greater percentage of deaths will occur during the dynamic response and overall the rate of change regarding infected people will decrease leading the rate to continue artificially inflating with time. Best someone like you and I could do is wait another month for more data. Take a 1 - 2 month window and calculate the Deceased / Cured ratio within that period. It will still have dynamic effects or second order effects, so it will remain conservative. But it will isolate a window with 3 - 4 full cycles of infection, death, or recovery.\n\nAn interesting project for someone to take up would be to plot the daily *moving average* D / C curves over varying window lengths. Say 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month etc. It will start at infinity as we mentioned, and should decay to some steady value over time. Regression techniques could then give fair estimates of steady state rates ... that is until the bell gets rung again somehow.\n\nTLDR: We're seeing the *dynamic* response of a novel virus. Mortality rates will be relatively high at first, but should decay to a steady state. 1 - 3% rates are conservative, as they are derived using dynamic data. Expect it to go down.",

What makes COVID-19 more dangerous, however, is the spread rate and the current lack of a vaccine. We are very good at developing a vaccine for the new strain of flu every year, so countries with access to good medical systems see relatively few deaths from flu each year, and it's usually the elderly or already infirm who die. The problem is, we don't have a vaccine for COVID-19, so the spread can't be contained via those means. This means that developed and undeveloped countries are almost on a level playing field when it comes to spread rate. The only option so far is to isolate people who catch it. Problem with that is it has a near 12 day incubation period, during which a carrier is contagious, but without symptoms. That leaves a carrier as a kind of walking bioweapon who is completely unaware of it. If we can develop a vaccine and distribute it, the spread can be contained much more efficiently, but until such a time, we have limited options. Hence why it's so potentially dangerous if it starts spreading out of control. We're not looking at an end of the world scenario, but we are potentially looking at millions to tens of millions of deaths at worst.",

There seems to be a very direct analogy between coronavirus and swine flu, where the early figures reported were in a developing nation, based on severe cases only and led to initial estimates of the death rates being very high (which has been described as happening to coronavirus). It is also worth noting the relatively high levels of panic in both cases. Ultimately, the swine flu was reported to have a fatality rate of 0.01-0.08%.\n\nI'm not saying coronavirus is at all like swine flu or is not that dangerous, but there is a very recent historical precedent for something not worse than the seasonal influenza being considered far more dangerous than it actually is.",

Nonetheless, considering the overall magnitude of the ongoing epidemic, a 5%\u20138% risk of death is by no means insignificant. In addition to quantifying the overall risk of death, future research must identify groups at risk of death (e.g., the elderly and people with underlying comorbidities) \\[22,23\\]. Moreover, considering that about 9% of all infected individuals are ascertained and reported \\[24\\], the infection fatality risk (IFR), i.e., the risk of death among all infected individuals, would be on the order of 0.5% to 0.8%.\n\nTakeaways:\n\n- 5 - 8% mortality rate among those confirmed to be infected.\n- This mortality rate is only around 30 - 40% that of MERS and SARS.\n- Expected 9% of actual infections get reported, because many are mild.\n- **Actual mortality rate amongst all infected is 0.5 - 0.8%.**\n\n\nComparable toral mortality rate for seasonal influenza is about **0.13%** based on CDC numbers. https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/index.html\n\nSo, 4- 6 x worse than influenza based on just this study.",

I've asked people to look at raw figures on influenza and consider how they might interpret them if they didn't know any better. Last year, 280k people in the US were hospitalized for the flu and 16k of them died. That would be nearly a 6% CFR if we weren't aware that there are dozens cases we don't know about for every case that's hospitalized.\n\nWe're very much in the phase where we do not know better, but there are indicators that what happened in China has more to do with prevalence than severity. China's numbers still list something like 81% mild, but most of those still show some signs of pneumonia. Outside of China, you mostly see cases that don't present shortness of breath, so there's clearly a massive selection bias.",

            "comment": "How deadly isn't quite the right answer you're looking for. You want to know three numbers about a virus:\n\n1. How long does it take to become contagious or show symptoms after being initially exposed to it?\n2. How often does a person exposed to the virus die from the virus?\n3. How easily does the virus spread from one person or surface to the next?\n\nThese three things working together as a system can determine how LETHAL a virus will be within a community of people.\n\nSo how do you make things tougher for the virus to cause damage to a community of people?\n\n1. Quarantine people who are infected for as long as whatever answer you have to question #1. Keep them isolated so they can be monitored for at least that long for symptoms. This prevents them from spreading the virus to others.\n2. The answer to #2 may seem counter-intuitive. The more people a virus kills the more difficult it is to find new hosts to infect. Most deadly viruses only kill SOME of the people they infect, this way the virus is able to find new uninfected hosts more easily. A virus that kills 100% of the hosts it infects will quickly burn itself out. This is why a virus that only kills 50% of the hosts it infects is in some ways just as scary as a virus that kills 100% of its hosts. Knowing the answer to #2 gives you an idea how far the virus can spread each week if preventative steps are not taken.\n3. The answer to #3 can give you an idea of what types of barrier protection will be needed to prevent YOU becoming infected, as well as the community you live in. Does the virus break down easily under sunlight or warm temperatures? Will washing hands be enough? Should people start wearing facemasks to prevent the virus from spreading if you cough or sneeze? (Facemasks worn in public are to prevent you from infecting others, not the other way around. They provide little to no protection otherwise aside from barrier protection against accidental droplet exposure.) Is the virus particularly hardy and able to survive on surfaces for weeks or longer? Is bleach enough to clean a surface that has the virus on it?\n\nYou find out the answer to those three questions and you'll know how deadly a virus is.",

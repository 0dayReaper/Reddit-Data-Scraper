Never in recorded history have all three of them completely frozen, but the smaller two (American and Bridal Veil\u201d) have frozen a few times.  When it happens, most of the water on the surfaces of Lake Erie and the Niagara river is already frozen so the volume of water going over the falls is reduced anyway. The rest of the moving water goes over the unfrozen parts of the Horseshoe falls.  Besides this, two big hydroelectric power plants, one American and one Canadian, divert water away from the falls to generate electricity.  This means the river and the falls have less water than they can handle anyway.  \n\nSource: grew up in the city of Niagara Falls.  This stuff is local legend and drilled into our heads as kids.  ",

On the Canadian side, the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Generating Stations can do 1,997 megawatts.\n\nDepending on the standard you use, 750-1,200 houses are powered per megawatt. 4,672 megawatt total, so 4 million homes is a reasonable estimate.\n\nProduction is dependent on need. Midnight in winter needs less production than a 90 degree summer day, for instance. The actual production will always be well below maximum capacity. But, as long as water flows, they can put out the electricity. It's a continuous figure. \n\n[If you're curious, it's easy to spot on Google maps](https://www.google.com/maps/@43.1461422,-79.043191,1630m/data=!3m1!1e3), they're basically across the river from each other, just north of the falls, and supplied by large reservoirs (fed from water up stream).",

We pay next to nothing for natural gas (in fact, the fees associated with the hookup cost more than gas except in the dead of winter like now, where it's 8F).\n\nElectric heat would cost us probably $150 more a year to run, possibly more.\n\nAreas where hydro is big, or even near nuclear plants, electricity is much cheaper than gas for heating purposes.\n\nIt's quite interesting how diverse our energy grid is.",

The great lakes have different elevations, due to the basins they're in. Superior is 600ft, it feeds Michigan/Huron (basically connected and leveled at 577 ft) via St Mary's River. Huron feeds Erie (571 ft) via St Clair River/Detroit River. Erie feeds Ontario (246 feet) via Niagara. The falls are part of that big change in elevation. Ontario feeds the Atlantic (0 feet) via the St Lawrence.\n\n&gt;If we had left it all to nature, would erosion eventually join the 2 lakes?\n\nErosion is pushing the falls back, closer to Erie. The closer it gets, the more water can flow through, the wider it gets. Sooner or later, the water will win, and they'll be joined without a water fall.\n",

When power demand is high you can turn up the water flow to satisfy the demand, slowly lowering the water levels. \n\nFor example here in Sweden we have a ton of rivers and get a huge portion of our electricity from hydro power. In the middle of the night hours 33% of the total power production comes from hydro. During the evening that spikes up to 45% to satisfying the high demand. \n\nThe Niagara fall is rated for 2,675MW of power production. During peak hours of the day it might be pushing near that amount. Looking over a full year the power output is fairly consistent. There will always be some water flow, during heavy rain season you could have a ton more water and higher power production but that could probably vary a lot year to year so I think it would be hard to predict how exactly it varies over a hole year.",

Pumped-storage hydroelectricity is the leading method of large-scale energy storage worldwide. A gross simplification is that it's easier to fill a large storage facility (canyon) with water than it is to fill that canyon with a connected array of batteries. And you don't have to maintain the water (it just sits there) unlike other storage mechanisms.\n\nSmall flood control basins often double as parks. Spillways use concrete energy dissipators (https://i.imgur.com/StM0Tsk.jpg) at the base instead of generators because the cost to maintain a generator year round outweighs the benefit of energy production, so the energy of the flowing water is wasted in that it's not used to generate electricity.\n\nSource: civil engineering degree\n\n",

It stops large ice chunks from the lake from entering the river and causing issues with the power plants.\n\nThe negative side effect is that it can cause the immediate area around it (city of Buffalo) to stay colder longer into the spring, as the colder ice is held adjacent to the city and not allowed to flow away until it is mostly melted (and melting is an endothermic process).",

The vast majority of river systems/lakes/etc have a mandatory minimum flow for environmental purposes so there's always water moving. There is a phenomnon called frazil ice that can be a real pain in the ass https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frazil_ice\n\n It's very difficult to actually balance supply and demand in a region, the grid is interconnected by tie-lines and importing/exporting is happening all the time. There are times for example it may be financially beneficial to buy power from one neighbor and export power to another. ",

That\u2019s an average of 1,200,000 gallons (4,542,500 liters) of water per second with only 600,000 gal/sec (2,271,250 liters/sec) left to run over the Horseshoe Falls and a mere 150,000 gal/sec (567,811 liters/sec) for the American Falls. Although it may seem as though the Falls are being deprived of their natural flow, the water that remains to cover the falls is still an impressive sight. Many waterfall enthusiasts agree that reduced flow makes for waterfalls with more \u201ccharacter.\u201d\n",

In the summer, during the day, there is an agreement that states the water cannot he diverted as much. This is so that tourists can see the falls \u201cin all their glory\u201d. At nighttime and during the winter, much more is diverted for energy production. \n\nAs for your question. Historically speaking, ice bridges have formed, even to the point where people would play on the bridges, set up a market, and walk across to the other country\u2019s side. This has been illegal since 1912, but even while this happened, water still flowed over the falls. Although the ice bridge was thick and sturdy, the fast flowing water runs beneath the ice, so it can look like the falls have frozen, but there is still water flowing over them, along and behind the ice. Think of it like an icy covering that\u2019s hiding the real flow of water. \n\nThere is only one instance of the falls completely freezing over, about 150 years ago, however all the other water had completely frozen as well, so the side effects were minimal. \n\ntl;dr\nIf Niagara Falls ever did completely freeze over, the rest of Lake Erie probably did to, so there would be no concern for flooding or anything of the sort.

            "comment": "Normally when a water fall freezes the water under the ice is still flowing. Unless the water freeses completely, which does happen, leads to lots of flooding when the spring melt comes along. Not a huge issue for some river systems, especially like niagra which has an upper river water control system that controls water flow over the falls. Also it flows from the north, which is normally colder, meaning if the northern section of the river is frozen solid the southern section will have a reduced water flow to deal with. \n\nWhere i live in Alberta the river systems are completely solid until they flow down over the US boarder down south. This morning was -45\u00b0c and its been a solid -30\u00b0c for a few weeks now. Until the system reaches that -10\u00b0c and lower range it is just a big ice cube all the way up into the mountains where they start. We will likely have a fair ammount of flooding this spring due to chinook systems that warm the temperature to +10\u00b0c for 5-7 days allowing for thaw and then dropping back to -30\u00b0c after the system passes. Which causes that thawed water to freeze on top of the ice that hasnt melted. Just piles of ice stacking on top of eachother, waiting to melt. Interestingly enough the large ammounts of melted ice water isnt the danger in the spring thaw but rather the large chunks of ice that have yet to melt being carried downstream in the increased pace the spring melt flows with. Its been known to take out bridges and houses along the shore. Reshaping the bedrock even and altering the flow of the river in extreme cases.",

Once Lake Erie stops to flow Huron, and Michigan will stop flowing also (the three are roughly the same level). It would take a decade or more to fill all three up to the point that they threaten to pour overland into other smaller lakes. Huron alone has to raise up almost 6 feet before it can significantly flood any of the surrounding lands.\n\nAll that aside, Summer will come along before any serious damage can be caused by the falls freezing solid.

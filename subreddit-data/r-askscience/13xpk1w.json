            "comment": "at least in the case of the classic visual aura, where you see a scintillating pattern slowly moving out into peripheral vision, followed by a deep scotoma, the aura is almost certainly something called \"cortical spreading depression\" in primary visual cortex.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_spreading_depression\n\nbasically, starting somewhere in the foveal confluence (a twisty part of visual cortex where several visual areas converge), something happens to produce a wave of very high neural activity that lasts for several seconds, followed by deep suppression that lasts for several minutes. the wave moves at ~3mm per minute, so it takes ~20 minutes to traverse the entire primary visual cortex.\n\nsome have hypothesized that this CSD is not just correlated with but somehow causal in some types of migraine - the CSD produces biochemical waste or other sorts of imbalance that sifts through that hemisphere (maybe just through CS fluid) and irritates the trigeminal nerve (which is why the side of the aura typically is the same side the headache will be on).\n\nyears ago I recorded many of my own auras (they stopped long ago) and fit a simple cortical wave model to them. [it was pretty neat! you can read some of my journals, with figures, here:] (https://xuexixs.blogspot.com/search/label/migraine?updated-max=2012-08-16T15:24:00-04:00&amp;max-results=20&amp;start=32&amp;by-date=false)",

But as I said it's pretty mysterious still. Migraine aura are very difficult to capture in the lab.",

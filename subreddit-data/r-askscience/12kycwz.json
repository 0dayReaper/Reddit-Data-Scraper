I know kelp isn't considered a plant because of how simple its structure is, but is a thallus really that much more complicated? Could someone explain (in language my 9th graders could understand) exactly where that line is? Or is there some more obvious distinction that I am completely missing?",

            "comment": "What makes a plant, a plant?  You commonly hear people talk about \"tissue complexity\", but that's really just a rule of thumb and not the _actual_ definition of plants, and that's what's causing confusion here.  What _really_ defines a plant is two things: first, plants are a single monophyletic group, aka, they are a common ancestor and _all_ the descendants.  Second, this group is defined by sharing a particular method of reproduction.  I'll go through both of these and hopefully you can find some useful information for your class.  \n\nSo first, we'll just look at the relationship between plants and kelp.  [Here](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0169534719302575-gr1.jpg) is a tree of eukaryotic life.   It's not labeled, so I'll have to tell you where stuff is.  Plants are in \"Chloroplastida\" and kelp is way over in \"Stramenopila\".   These branches are not at all close to each other, and most of the other branches \"in between\" them are things which look absolutely nothing like plants...they are mostly single celled and many are not photosynthetic.   Indeed, both plants and kelp have become large, complex multicellular things independently.  And kelp even acquired photosynthesis differently...plants (and the green algae they came from) got photosynthesis by taking in photosynthetic bacteria.  Kelp (and the brown algae they came from) got photosynthesis by taking in _green algae_.  They are basically endosymbiotic turduckens.  So in short, these are two very different groups.\n\nSo if we can't simply use complexity or shape to define plants, what _does_ define them?  The key is in their proper name, Embryophyta.  Algae are aquatic and just let loose their eggs and sperm into the water, where the  eggs are fertilized and develop out in the open.  This is what kelp also do.  The key thing that plants do, and it's the thing that lets them be more successful on land, is to keep the egg inside the mother plant, in a protective structure called an archegonium.  In this structure it grows into a multicellular embryo.   In mosses and liverworts and ferns this grows into a specialized spore-producing structure.  In seed plants it grows into a seed embryo.  \n\nSo if you want to show the distinction, show their different locations on the tree of life (you can probably find a better labeled version than I did) and talk about how they photosynthesize differently and reproduce differently, but have come to similar shapes because that's just a good shape for being a large photosynthetic thing.",

Variation in phenotypes is obviously one of the primary tools, but since we are not omniscient, we use trait differences with the understanding that they are only a proxy for descent, subject to convergence and, at the extreme end, horizontal transfer in the microbial world. Often a very good proxy at the level of major morphology and body plan, but increasingly obscure as you get into more contrived and detailed descriptions of some trait.",

Kelp certainly have cells with nucleuses so they aren't prokaryotes.  Then you have the eukaryotes: plant, animal, fungi, and Protista.  Protista is a bit fuzzy because it basically contains whatever doesn't fit in the other three categories, but one of its defining characteristics is the lack of multiple types of tissue.  Protista only have one clearly defined type of tissue.  And since kelp only have one clearly defined type of tissue, despite their plant like appearance they are not plants, but protists (at least for now).  \n\nAnother difference is reproduction.  Kelp reproduce using simple spores, basically kelp cells that separate from the parent kelp.  Plants have more complex reproduction cycle, even those which use similarly named spores are more complex than the single cell spores of kelp.\n\nLiverworts (and all land plants) share common characteristics such as having a vascular system (kelp do not) for distributing nutrients, have roots, etc.\n\nBeyond that there are genetic differences between plants and kelp.  All plants can be traced back to a common ancestor which does not include kelp.\n\nBasically outward appearance alone is not sufficient for classification anymore.",

There are many examples of convergent physiology which cross cladistic lines, and sometimes they even violate what once were key features in the differentiations of two clades. Now, obviously morphology derives almost entirely from genetics, and so it is generally an extremely good proxy for tracing ancestry, but when you are comparing gross body plans it is often easy to mistake two convergent adaptations as deriving from a shared ancestral phenotype. Monophyletic groups are constantly broken and reevaluated, and generally the simpler the organisms, the more often this occurs. The reason for this is obvious if understood from the perspective of canalization: large, complex, multicellular organisms with hundreds of specialized tissues have a much harder time making major changes to their physiology than a protist with a handful of organelles.\n\n&gt;\tFor the record, I am agree with you, I\u2019m just confused about the whole thing.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, most people are, even those of us who work in fields dealing with cladistics. But I think part of your confusion is trying to reconcile holes in the pictures which seem like contradictions or inconsistencies, but in actuality are instances where ancestry is clearer than similarities or differences in the trait you\u2019re looking at, for whatever reason (genetics, another ancestral trait with stronger evidence, etc). For example, two species might have differences in vasculature, but perhaps three identical photosynthetic pigments which more strongly group them together than the differences in vasculature differentiate them. \n\ntl;dr the \u201creason\u201d things are put into these different categories is based on our best guesses as to the organization of their descent. Morphology helps in this regard, but is subservient to the true goal of cladistics, which is ancestry",

Then, a while after that, one of those many archaea swallowed a bacterium that could make energy from light, and that slowly became the group of algae and plants. Eventually, there were so many eukaryotes and so many of those algae, that one of the eukaryotes that wasn't an alga swallowed one of the ones that was, in that same exact way! That means instead of just chloroplasts made of bacteria, this chloroplast has twice the walls around it and used to be an entire eukaryotic cell! Eventually some of these new eukaryotes with the weird chloroplasts became multicellular, and they're the kelp we know today. But they're totally different! They're billions of years separated from the plants and algae they swallowed. That's why they're not considered plants.",

Our core body temperature drops which allows certain proteins to work differently than they do during our \"waking temp,\" as a broad example. It's not something we'd want easy control over. \n\nMost importantly the process of getting sleepy is highly regulated by not only our Circadian rhythm but also by other hormone systems. \n\nWe need to burn energy to feel fatigued (when we use ATP and make Adenosine as a byproduct, which signals fatigue in humans). \n\nWe need a lack of blue-wavelength light to initiate the process of releasing melatonin at night, which makes us sleepy and helps initiate the sleeping-end of our Circadian processes. \n\nWe don't have voluntary control over sleep because it's chemically regulated. Adenosine, melatonin, hypercretin (Orexin), etc.. \n\nIt's not something we can flex like a muscle. It's essentially hormonal in nature and therefore requires us to use drugs (meaning ligands that bind to targets in our body) to control it. \n\n",

If you do other actions than just going to bed, this often resets the action. HOWEVER, it takes about 15 minutes to sleep (sleep process) . It depends on WHEN the decision is made to go to sleep . Around the 6 minute mark, we begin to experience retrograde amnesia. If get up to go to sleep after this point its likey you wont remember it, and you will instead go right to sleep as soon as you get in bed. HOWEVER if you DONT, if you try to do other stuff, you brain has to wake up and halt the process, reseting your fall asleep cycle.

I heard people complaining about it but could never really believe that they can't fall asleep because..you know..they wanna sleep don't they? \nIn other words: I think I can sleep whenever I want to. I get up at 6 to get ready for work, drink 2 cups of coffee, work is cancelled - of course I can fall asleep again in under 30 mins.\nI was sleepless exactly 3 nights in my life, and that was when I was severely ill. \nAm I just lucky or is this kinda not normal?",

If one of our ancestors heard a predator nearby, for them to have a kick of adrenaline and climb to a higher branch would have perhaps made them more likely to survive than heavy sleepers that blew it off and had a saber toothed bear climb up the lower branches and snatch them. \n\nSo the genes that influenced you being able to have a kick of adrenaline that could keep you awake if you sensed danger got passed on. \n\n",

Turning off screens and favouring 'redder' light tones, exercising daily, doing relaxing activities that 'cool' you down (lower blood pressure, heart rate, core temp) closer to bedtime, cutting off drinking and eating for a sufficient time before bed, are all things I've heard and used to help create a bedtime routine.\n\nI am aware that no matter how many of these things you do, they won't help you fall asleep 5 hours after you've woken up from a full rest, or at the wrong time of day, but within the ground of your Circadian rhythm there is a little room to play, no?",

Better to just leave that part to the \"hardcoded\" part of our bodies so that we can tune out pain when we really need it, that is adrenaline and the fight or flight response.\n\nOf course, this is just speculation, so take what I said with a grain of salt.",

I can think of lots of things that sound like they would be useful (ability to turn off pain sensors, sleeping at will, ignoring hunger when food is scarce, etc). But I can also see how pretty much any of them could lead to an animal hurting itself in ways that reduce its chances of living to reproduce. Could I have survived as a teenager or little kid if I could severely hurt myself while playing and turn off that pain? Or if I could just decide that I didn\u2019t want to sleep until I started making unwise, risky decisions?\n\nOr perhaps it can\u2019t. It may be that sleep, in order to be functional, requires certain things that prevent it from being controlled at will. \n\nBut we also have the option that it just isn\u2019t very needed. Imagine two groups of early hominids. One group can control sleep while one can sleep only when tired. Would one of these groups actually outcompete the other? While I think controlling the need to sleep would be neat, it just might not be all that beneficial, evolutionarily speaking. ",

You need to sleep, and, if deprived, you *will* sleep (just like you *will* urinate, eventually). That said, finding the appropriate conditions for sleep can be difficult. There is [evidence of sleep patterns being conserved regardless of brain/body ratio](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627313009045), which suggests that passive sleep entry is also conserved. There are cyclical hormonal changes (melatonin and cortisol being the main factors), which are involved in induction of sleep, so parts of the impetus to sleep are physiological, and induction is extrinsic. Under stressful circumstances, those extrinsic factors can also prevent sleep (like a mountain lion or worrying).",

A person in the wild has to scout for a camp to begin with. And in hostile country, the scouting becomes that much more difficult. It doesn't matter if the person is sleeping at noon by choice, or evening via circadian rhythm, they are going to have to find a safe place to sleep regardless. \n\nI'm not sure why you think \"natural chemical processes\" are superior to reasoned thought.",

You can certainly keep yourself awake (until your body makes you sleep) similar to how you can stop breathing, and you can certainly start the process for falling asleep (lying down and closing your eyes), where your body will take over and you will begin to fall asleep. \n\nOther than the time it takes for the process, they are quite similar if you think about it.  First you decide to do something, then your brain starts the process.  You think, \"I want to stop breathing, so I wont drown under water\" and then your brain sends the messages to the appropriate muscles, etc and you stop breathing.  ",

It's more about what evolutionary advantage it would be to being able to directly control your sleep system.\n\nWhat would happen if you could manually control your heart rate? Any human that could do that would quickly accidentally kill themselves. And any human that could manually &amp; immediately control their sleep would do it wrong a lot and at inopportune times.\n\nWe can control our bladders - but it takes time and learning how to do it. Also what happens when we get terrified? Releasing our bladders spontaneously happens in inopportune times - but in that situation, it's not deadly. immediate sleep is deadly.\n\nWe can manually control our breathing (and now you are) to a certain extent. But that's because swimming would be beneficial to our ancestors in certain instances. And even with that, we can 'breathe wrong' in certain situations.\n\nBut for sleep, we DO have some control over it - similar to breathing. If you relax, get to a comfortable spot, in an area that isn't inducing anxiety or fear, close your eyes, and let your mind drift then you can \"allow\" yourself to sleep. This system gets you the ability to control your sleep, but indirectly and only when certain conditions are met.\n\nThat's much less dangerous and more advantageous than the direct control method.",

            "comment": "I feel like a lot of people are straying from the core of this question. I am a senior in college studying psychology and have worked with both an evolutionary psychology researcher and a neuropsychologist who researches insomnia. The underlying reason for sleep is the circadian rhythm. While I don't have any journal articles on hand to cite, I can tell you from my lectures and textbooks and personal research (and as an individual who has suffered from insomnia) that the driving force for sleep comes from the build up of melatonin in your brain that triggers the neuron in the hypothalamus that is in charge of your circadian rhythm. If you don't know what the circadian rhythm is nows the time to learn kiddos...\n\nThe circadian rhythm is the internal clock we all have that keeps us running. Traditionally the average has been 24 hours for the length of a human rhythm but this rhythm varies with genetic mutations and what not and is different across species. Scientists first studied rat brains to understand human brains and that is where most of this research has come from (my professor did a lot of work at Harvard doing this kind of research and told me many stories about it as well as my classmates in our lectures). When it comes to us humans this rhythm is what keeps us in our daily schedule, that one you plan in your head. It keeps us hungry, thirsty, and sleepy on a schedule amougst other things. When this rhythm is in balance due to good health (which means a healthy MIND AND BODY!) sleep comes easy. Yes your mind needs to be healthy too! Stress and anxiety can kill you and it ruins this rhythm. It also changes with age, as we grow older we need less and less sleep. You can go see your doctor if you think your hormones are out of balance, which can be a cause of sleep issues, but for the most part regular healthy diet and exercise keep the rhythm on track. \n\nThe only other factor seen affecting people today is blue light. Blue light comes from all your electronics at various levels. Blue light also is the strongest light from the sun that affects us hormonally. This light enters the retina and triggers melatonin release, and if you haven't caught on by now melatonin is the natural hormone that runs your circadian rhythm. So to help keep this factor at bay you could try switching to natural light when possible and change your sleep patterns to fit into the natural pattern of the sunrise and sunset so that you can find your true sleep equilibrium. \n\nAfter about a month or so of a consistent sleep pattern your body should naturally adjust and you could very easily \"fall asleep\" whenever you wanted. The key here is a balance. A balance of a healthy mind and a healthy body. Therapy exists for a reason. Your body is a well oiled machine run by the circuit board that is your brain. If you can't make the circuit board function well the whole system fails. \n\nIf you want more information about sleep check out this website https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-topics/what-circadian-rhythm.",

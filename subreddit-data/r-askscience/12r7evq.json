Is this going on here? \n\nI am also quite amused at the possibility of something that is ultimately bad in the long run for the environment may actually be good for the environment in some respects! \n\nHas anyone actually studied oil rig's effect on the immediate local ecosystem?",

            "comment": "I think the term ecological island is a stretch, but oil rigs have the same local impact that other structures have in (relatively) deep water.  Things like navigation aids, boat hulls, floating debris.\n\nThere are a lot of organisms that prefer some cover to be near, and even more that are looking for a surface to attach to.\n\nRigs grow seaweed and barnacles, which attracts crustaceans and fish, crab etc.\n\nSo while there is a local benefit, it's not any different than any other object in the sea would generate.",

They stay there for years or even decades.  There are also similarly embedded platforms for pipelines that use compressors to keep the pipelines pressurized and flowing properly.  The company that owns each one is responsible for removing it when it is no longer in use.  This process is called PnA.  Plug and Abandon.  The well itself is pumped full of concrete and cut off several feet below the mud line.  The huge steel supports for the platform are likewise cut below the mudline (from the inside using explosives) and the platforms are put on a barge to either be used someplace else or cut up for scrap.",

In fact in some areas they have to patrol the unmanned rigs to prevent fishermen from taking advantage of this!",

They used to cut the rigs off below the waterline and at least leave the legs there for the marine life, but now when they remove the old rigs they take every bolt and scrap of metal off the sea floor. I mean everything. Nothing left. They scan the bottom after to make sure. Now boats have to go a lot further out to find good fishing.",

            "comment": "I find human-made structures like this and their ecological effects really fascinating.  \n\nThese oil wells don't really act as ecological islands in a desert (nor is the soft bottom of the gulf a desert, exactly) but they do act more like artificial reefs.  They can have pretty huge impacts on local fish and marine invertebrate abundance, especially since they are such vertical structures.  Also you can't generally run a commercial fishing boat right up to them, which enhances this effect.   There's some debate about whether they merely attract fish or actually increase production, but it seems to vary a bit depending on the particular situation.  But it's not just native species and valuable fish species that may benefit from oil rigs, invasive species may be able to use them as \"stepping stones\" to disperse across soft-bottom areas.  They also may play a role in some jellyfish blooms, since the polyp stage of the jellyfish needs a hard surface to live on.  \n\nSo yeah, oil rigs very much add to the _local_ marine diversity at the rig, although not always the diversity of the species we want.  Their effects on larger scale diversity are a bit less well known, but on the balance they probably increase it by increasing hard structure and the diversity of habitats present...aside from the actual oil pumping part!  \n\nHere's some papers I found off the top of my head if you want to read more.  . \n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00548/full  \n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1411477111\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00447/full",

            "comment": "The largest exhibit at the Audubon Aquarium in New Orleans is about the Gulf of Mexico...and was paid for by several of the big oil companies (including BP, famous for causing the Gulf's largest oil spill). The tank is dominated by a mock-up of the base of a drilling rig, showing off all the sea life that can take advantage of the habitat provided.\n\nWhile they're not lying that creatures can and will colonize any large, underwater structure, I found the whole experience to be a nasty bit of greenwashing.  You'll walk out of the exhibit thinking that the only place that sea life exists in the Gulf of Mexico is around oil rigs, and that without Exxon and BP planting their extraction equipment in the sea, there would be no place for the poor fish to live.",

Why would deep drilling or manmade objects add to that, when we can't even fully justify their impact on the ecosystem itself?

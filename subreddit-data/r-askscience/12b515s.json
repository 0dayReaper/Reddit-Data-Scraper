            "comment": "Yes, at [subduction zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction). Broadly speaking and at a global scale, any total increase in plate sizes from creation of sea floor at mid-ocean ridges will be balanced by subduction of sea floor *somewhere* else. \n\nOne thing to clarify is that this doesn't imply that spreading is perfectly balanced by subduction of the *same* plate or adjacent to the *same* plate. While, it's certainly possible to have a plate that is effectively maintaining a constant surface area with paired equal subduction and half-spreading rates on opposite sides, it's not required (and not even necessarily common). Take the [North American Plate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Plate) for example. It broadly has spreading on the east side (i.e., the Mid-Atlantic Ridge) and subduction on the west side, but in most places it is the overriding plate (i.e., a plate, mostly the Pacific plate, is subducitng underneath it) meaning that the North American plate is broadly getting larger at the moment. To some extent, the western half of spreading of the Mid-Atlantic is balanced by subduction of the Pacific plate beneath, but it does not need to sum to zero on the basis of just these two plates^(1). What is required (in the sense of conservation of mass) is that spreading/extension in aggregate is balanced by subduction/underthrusting in aggregate across the whole surface of the planet. \n\nThe above also isn't just an assumption. We can measure plate velocities with techniques like GPS and show that we if consider chains of relative velocities, i.e., *plate circuits* (e.g., velocity of plate A with respect to B, plate C with respect to B, plate D with respect to C, plate E with respect to D, and plate A with respect to E), the velocities sum to zero within error. This is consistent with the idea that spreading is balanced *on average* with subduction (and that the planet is neither increasing or decreasing in volume / surface area).\n\n*^(1)And it broadly does not. If we use a [plate motion calculator](https://www.unavco.org/software/geodetic-utilities/plate-motion-calculator/plate-motion-calculator.html) to calculate the relative velocity of a spot in the middle of the North American plate (40N, 100W) with respect to the Pacific plate, we get that North America is moving 17.7 mm/yr east and 23.3 mm/yr south (or 29.2 mm/yr at an azimuth of 142) with respect to the Pacific plate. If calculate the relative velocity of that same spot with respect to the Eurasian plate, we get that North America is moving 22.4 mm/yr west and 5.5 mm/yr south (or 23 mm/yr at an azimuth of 256) with respect to Eurasia. While overly simplified (especially since plate motions are really rotations, and comparing linear velocities at a point, like we're doing is ignoring this), this gets the point across that spreading at the Mid-Atlantic is not perfectly balanced by subduction of the Pacific, i.e., the relative velocities are not equal. Or alternatively, we can look at [estimates of absolute plate motions](http://www-udc.ig.utexas.edu/external/becker/ftp/maps/plate_tectonics_simple.morvel.sa.1.pdf), i.e., the rate and directions of plate motions relative a similar non-moving reference. In this view, it's easy to see that the sum of Pacific - North America - Eurasia plate motion does not equal zero. Per the above though, if we summed all of the velocities of all of the plates, they would equal approximately zero.*",

            "comment": "Most of us believe that the other side of the plates is returning back inside the earth at essentially the same rate as new earth is coming from inside to surface at spreading centers.  There is a small number of mostly disregarded folks that argue for an expanding earth rather than the recycling conveyor belt idea that is plate tectonics.\n\nPlate tectonics says that there are regions where material is rising from depth and making new crust (spreading centers like mid-ocean ridges) and this process pushes large slabs of crust away from the spreading centers.  Eventually, some far distance away, different plates run into each other while pushing in (mostly) opposite directions and then one gets shoved down back into the earth.  Sometimes this involves formation of big mountains (with deep roots) but a more common result is the overriding of the denser oceanic plate material by less-dense continental crust.\n\nThe idea is that there is a steady state between new crust formation and old crust destruction by subduction) so on average, over time, the area of the earth's surface stays essentially the same.\n\nIf the return rate were different from the rate of new material production, the inside of the earth would have to be emptying, become less dense with time (the volume of the inside would have to grow at the very same time it lost material, so density would have to drop because that is what less mass in bigger volume means).\n\nDoes not seem to be any good evidence for an expanding surface of the earth or a measurable decrease in interior bulk density.\n\nThe so-called ring of fire around the pacific ocean is where the Pacific Ocean crust is running up against contents in all directions, and the ocean crust is being shoved back inside the earth.  Lots of earthquakes and lots of volcanoes.",

The mineral forms which exist at depth are telling us what the density conditions are at those depths.  Seismic wave behavior is particularly sensitive to density and mineral composition, so we have a pretty good idea of what is happening with minerals and rocks inside the earth, especially the shallow earth.\n\nThe average bulk density of the earth is about 5.5 g/cm^3 (grams per cubic centimeter or tonnes per cubic meter, same value). Water, for comparison, is about 1 g/cm^3.   \n\nThe crust is only about 2.7 g/cm^3. The crust, though, is a tiny portion of all the earth (a thin layer on the surface only).  If more crust is made, the bulk density of earth must become less (more volume but same mass=lower density).",

The simulation is just looking at the acoustic properties of the physical structure and modeling how they would vibrate. The fact that the human and monkey simulations sound so similar suggests that the structures are not very different, and that this is not the reason monkeys can't produce speech. It's not really to tell you what a monkey speaking would sound like... that's more editorial sensationalism.",

In particular, we look for quantifiable data from the models, not necessarily actual imitation of the real world.\n\nTo give an analogy, say I want to research automobile engine efficiency. In order to quantify the efficiency, I only need to limit my model to just the region from fuel and air input to the axle output and the exhaust output. You might argue that the road condition, weather condition, driver skill and tire pressure could affect the vehicle's actual efficiency, and you would be correct, but that's irrelevant to my study and a good researcher would limit the scope of the study to the bare essential.\n\nIn studying the vocal chord structure, what matters is the muscle contraction and airflow (input) and the spectrum of the vibration that comes out (output). The fact that the sound that comes out doesn't sound like speech is irrelevant. The scientists would be doing a quantitative comparison between the spectral crosssection of the sound, they don't do a qualitative evaluation like \"Yep, that sounds like a human\".",

I assume they have well developed  arcuate fasciculus but i'm not sure if that necessarily means they truly understand the word before repeating it. Would you look at the \"grammar\" part of the brain for hints on this?",

A test many primates failed after being taught language. Personally I've always been skeptical of it as a test for self awareness though. It's also a test of optical perception (a hugely complicated concept which science is just starting to scratch the surface off) and there is no way to determine which test was actually failed. Was it a failure to recognize the self or a failure to recognize the image of the self? It's entirely conceivable that one may succeed in the former and not in the latter. Even humans can fail at the latter. A blind person would not recognize themselves in a mirror but nobody reasonably supposes they are not self aware.\nSo failing the mirror test could speak more to how different species evolved vision and perception than it ever spoke about self awareness.

                            "comment": "I can't answer about the structure of parrots' brains leading to their comprehension, but Alex the African grey parrot which a lot of others have mentioned could count objects and tell you how many there were. This may seem trivial, but in order to do this, an animal actually needs to understand/do some very complex things.\n\nFirst, he needs to be able to know and **vocalize** (or indicate in some way) the numbers to tell us that he understands. Alex can say the words \"one\", \"two\", \"three\", etc. but that doesn't necessarily mean much. He could just be parroting. So, second, an animal needs to understand that the number \"sounds\" (tags) correspond to a numerical value. This is called **tagging**. When Alex sees three things, he knows that this quantity of things equates to the tag \"three\". And here we're talking about **absolute numbers**, rather than relative numbers like few, many, more, or less. Thirdly, an animal needs to understand that, in a set of items which he's counting, the tag applied to the last item in the set corresponds with the name for the number of items in the set. It's like when a child counts items: \"One, two, three. Three balloons!\" This is called **cardinality**.\n\nBeyond these things required for counting, which are already quite remarkable and complex, Alex understood the difference between shapes, colors, and materials (wood, metal, cotton, or something like that), and could tell you which was which! So in the videos of him counting (which you should definitely check out on YouTube), he's presented with a tray of many item and asked \"How many red?\". He can count up all the red items, regardless of shape or material, and tell you, \"four\". That's really quite incredible. So yes, he was really comprehending both the questions and the words he was saying. He even came up with the idea of zero (\"none\" when shown no red items) without being taught it in a numerical context. \n\nThis post is already really really long, but there's also a really interesting study on grammar in dolphins, specifically in word order and sentence context. E.g. they understood \"bring item A to item B\" is different from \"bring item B to item A\", which is pretty complex as well. Worth looking at.",

There are several theories of how language and learned vocalizations evolved in humans, songbirds, parrots, bats, and cetaceans (whales, dolphins), but a general consensus is that it arose independently several times. Some of my favorite neuroscientists who write about this are Erich Jarvis and Johan Bolhuis. Both are songbird researchers. Jarvis has a three part series on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/E0MtW9URFhg) about this if you want to learn more. I haven't watched it but have seen him lecture a few times and he does a great job explaining it. \n\nAlso, I wouldn't refer to parrots as lesser animals in terms of intelligence. Corvids and parrots have exhibited a wide range of intelligent behaviors that was once considered only available to humans and some other apes such as tool use and recursive learning. A recent [study](http://m.pnas.org/content/113/26/7255.full) has shown that the density of neurons in birds' brains, especially parrots and songbirds, are comparable to humans and primates.",

If a breeder wants to make a smart dog, they are limited by the theorical \"smartest possible dog\" the genes in the current population can create. Once you've bred that dog, you have to wait many generations for dog brains to mutate, which will create a new population with a new \"smartest possible dog.\"\n\nHumans, in our evolution, had extreme natural selection pressure for intelligence, but it still took millions of years for language, fire, farming, and all that other good stuff, because selection, whether natural or directed by us, can only *select* from the variety of traits mutation provides.",

Canines (and mammals) are more flexible in where they go to survive, so I think that'd be a bigger reason that they've changed more than sharks/crocs. When scientists says that an animals has barely evolved in millennia, it just means that the bones of today closely match the fossils of eons ago, it has nothing to do with mutation rate. Keep in mind, too, that dogs were bred by humans to be extremely diverse over many centuries.\n\nIt would be WAY easier to graft human intelligence genes into an animal than to wait for smart gene mutations to come around, especially considering how difficult it is to measure animal intelligence. Of course, putting a human brain in an animal would have tons of other biological and ethical problems...",

Because birds, including parrots, make sounds, and those sounds are often meaningful. So they can assume that if we both make sounds, we both probably attach meaning to the sounds. Intelligence recognizes intelligence. \n\nAnyway, once they make this connection they will mimic our sounds. If we give them a reward they will continue to mimic the sounds they hear.  So a parrot will make the sounds that get them what they want. If the sound \u201chey\u201d gets you to pay attention to it, it will use the sound \u201chey\u201d to get your attention. If you hold a treat and repeat \u201ckill all humans\u201d until the parrot repeats \u201ckill all humans\u201d and then you give it the treat, it will use the sound \u201ckill all humans\u201d when it wants a treat. \n\nHere\u2019s the thing though: do you consider it speaking if the parrot then first uses the sound \u201chey\u201d to get your attention, followed by the sound \u201ckill all humans\u201d to tell you it wants a treat? I do. The only reason the sound \u201ckill all humans\u201d means kill all humans to you is because you learned that. The parrot thinks \u201ckill all humans\u201d means \u201ccan I have a treat?\u201d because that it what it was led to believe. Don\u2019t believe? Try the same on a 2 year old human. You\u2019ll have them saying \u201ckill all humans\u201d all day long. (*Don\u2019t* actually do this with a 2 year old human.)\n\nThe sounds of language are arbitrary, to all species. \n\nIn this way, the parrots are not JUST mimicking us, instead they are speaking to us as well as they are able, even if it\u2019s only about as good at it as a baby human.

            "comment": "I have some problems with this question. Namely, it is important to consider the evolutionary context of a species rather than attempting to quantify its intelligence or abilities. Without being facetious, primates aren't capable of human speech because they're not human. They are however capable of complex communication and have [intricate social structures](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XsrhU2vV5PIC&amp;redir_esc=y) much the same as our own. The evolutionary factors that acted on humans to drive our ancestors to develop complex symbolic languages did not act on other primates in the same way. But that doesn't necessarily make them 'less intelligent' than humans.\n\nInstead I'd argue that the notion of more or less intelligent is meaningless. To compare species we would first have to determine some measure of how intelligent an animal is. But that is impossible. We often use IQ tests to measure intelligence in humans but these test only make sense within the context of the human mind. There are many tasks at which other animals are vastly superior to humans whether for example, that's navigation or [visual memory](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/nov/07/animalbehaviour.psychology). These animals are very good these tasks because it is important to their evolutionary niche. Just the same as social intelligence and tool use is important to humans. You can't separate the intelligence of an animal from the rest of its nature and it's intelligence can only be understood within that context.",

IQ is and remains the single greatest numerical indicator of intelligence that exists.\n\nFrom Wikipedia\n\n&gt;Psychometricians generally regard IQ tests as having high\u00a0statistical reliability.[9][55]\u00a0A high reliability implies that \u2013 although test-takers may have varying scores when taking the same test on differing occasions, and although they may have varying scores when taking different IQ tests at the same age \u2013 the scores generally agree with one another and across time.\n\nFrom [Vox](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2016/5/24/11723182/iq-test-intelligence)\n\n&gt;IQ is often dismissed as antiquated, misguided, or less important than personality traits. But according to\u00a0Stuart Ritchie, an intelligence researcher at the University of Edinburgh, there's a massive amount of data showing that it's one of the best predictors of someone's longevity, health, and prosperity. And psychologists have been able to replicate these findings over and over.\n\nThe idea that IQ tests are archaic and not meaningful is completely false. IQ correlates to a ridiculous number if things.\n\nIt has flaws, and isn't perfect but \"IQ is debated\" is misleading. The majority of serious criticisms aren't that IQ is wrong and can't measure anything, but rather that there might be more things that aren't being measured (emotional intelligence).\n\nThe idea that \"IQ tests are racists\" holds a lot less ground today as they continually adjust the tests to try to eliminate cultural and gender bias. IIRC if the tests come back with minorities having significantly lower IQ's on average, it is inheritly assumed the test was biased.",

They just test how good you are (if you'll forgive the circularity of this statement) at the kind of tests that IQ tests are. \n\nThe usefulness of IQ is HIGHLY debated. So is the usefulness of specific mental disorder categories in the DSM. That doesn't mean both have no value or use, it means there are major potential issues with them. IQ DOES correlate with a lot of things. Yes. But that doesn't necessarily speak to the validity of IQ as a construct that represents what we consider \"intelligence\" as much as a measure of performance in certain arbitrary traits our society rewards. Certain scores on a psychopathy test ALSO correlate with prosperity, health and longevity (CEO are disproportionately both psychopaths and wealthy) but that wouldn't make Psychopathy a valid measure of intelligence. Especially since it's actually characterized by impairment of certain mental faculties. Being born into a wealth family is also a great predictor of someone's longevity, health, and prosperity. But that DEFINITELY doesn't make it a good measure for general intelligence.\n\nIt's not the RELIABILITY of IQ that's in question. It's the [CONSTRUCT VALIDITY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_validity) and the potential social implications it creates. IQ tests are certainly useful for many things, but the debate is over whether \"measuring how intelligent someone is\" is one of those things.\n\n&gt;The idea that \"IQ tests are racists\" holds a lot less ground today as they continually adjust the tests to try to eliminate cultural and gender bias. \n\nI mean, it can hold a lot less ground and still be holding a fair sized lot. There's a reason they're still continually adjusting. The vocabulary section alone is basically a massive confound and I don't know why it's still there. There is no body of words that are omnipresent in all cultures and regions which you're more likely to know if you're more intelligent. It basically just serves as a \"Do you read the kind of books the creators of this test think smart people read\" measure and that will ALWAYS be biased.",

Capuchin monkeys possess some cognitive abilities superior to apes, and the same is possibly true of some cetaceans, corvidae and parrots.\n\nParrots produce sounds in a complete different way as humans, so as far as I know the way they produce sound is more different to us than that of apes such as chimpanzees.",

The TLDR is that as the concept of \"thinking\" expanded in the deaf community (ie more words surrounding the concept) the deaf community was able to criticially think about problems in new ways (younger generations showed complex understanding of word problems that older generations did not).\n\nSo perhaps the issue isnt that they are not capable, but that we havent provided them the tools to understand.",

An extremely brief summary is that it's the only documented, natural language creation event linguists have.\n\nA longer summary is that in the 70s, Nicaragua built a school for the deaf, and suddenly the speakers (who were prior to this isolated and had only limited signs with their families but no real language) started developing a more sophisticated sign language thanks to being in constant contact with others. The younger students, who in essence grew up with the language rather than \"developing\" it, ended up having a much fuller grasp on the language and could more effectively encode ideas in NSL than their older counterparts, who despite helping develop the language were never as fluent in it.",

If you put two pieces of food in the room, one in the open where both can see it, and one behind the barrier so that only the subordinate can see it, then the subordinate will go for the food behind the barrier instead of the food in the open.\n\nHowever, if you make the barrier transparent, then they just go for the closest piece of food. This suggests that they *do* know what the dominant chimpanzee is able to see/think.\n\nChimpanzees females also groom subordinate males while the male \"hides\" behind a rock, out of view of the dominant male. So from the dominant's perspective, the female is just sitting next to a rock, when in reality she is grooming (and probably going to mate with) the subordinate male. These kinds of behaviors are only possible if they understand that other individuals sense different things.\n\n",

On one hand, you have caretakers and psychologists/anthropologists who are most similar with the individual apes who all tend to say with conviction that the apes all ask questions.\n\nThen you have language experts who claim that they do not, that instead they simply but only make demands, and infer from responses the reasons why the demands were or were not met.\n\nSo far, even the most complex sign language learned by an ape has not been complex enough to form fully human sentences. Personally, I don't think that is reason enough to dismiss what is obviously probing as a lack of questioning, and instead I would call it the same thing as asking questions.",

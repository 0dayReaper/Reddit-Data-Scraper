    "postText": "So  I look up in the sky and I see a star. Maybe the star is close to where  I am looking, but the light has been slightly warped because of  gravitation lensing from another star.\n\nBut  how do I - or maybe an astronomer - know that the physical location of  the star it isn't on the other side of the horizon from where I am  looking? Isn't it possible I am actually looking at a black hole and the  starlight has been warped enough so that I see it, but it isn't  anywhere close to where I am looking?\n\nAs  an analogy, I am sitting in the stands at a football stadium and I am  staring at the 50 yard line, but I see the uprights and goalpost because  there is a black hole on the 49 yard line (oops) that is  deflecting/warping the light by 90 degrees and toward my eyes.",

            "comment": "Light can be deflected by a large angle if it passes close enough to a black hole. In principle, light from a star on one side of the sky could indeed be deflected toward us by a black hole on the other side of the sky. See for example [this simulated picture](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/simulated_bh.jpg) and notice how the galactic center on the right-hand side of the picture also appears to the left of the black hole, within the [Einstein ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_ring).\n\nHowever, there is no concern that this effect could lead to seeing stars in the wrong places. As you can see in the picture, the black hole makes a distorted image of the whole sky. If we were able to resolve an individual star in that image, we would certainly also resolve the whole distorted image of the sky and infer that a black hole is there.",

Also, this is exactly how this effect was first measured by Eddington!\n\nUsually, what would happen is that we first know there is a massive object in the way to a far away galaxy or cluster, and then by doing some (mostly statistical) analysis, would learn about the details of the massive object through its effect on the observed galaxy.\n\nThe [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_gravitational_lensing) page has some nice explanations.",

When you factor in the warping of spacetime, the whole universe is a little wibbly wobbly.\n\nIt's easy to think of stars and galaxies like they're all in a fishbowl and you're watching them from the outside, but that's not how we experience the universe.\n\nIn other words, the 'where' of where something is all depends on how you plan to get there.\n\nFrom the point of view of the light beam hitting your eye, the star is exactly where it appears to be. From the point of view of traveling there slower than light, your path and the star's position would only converge sometime in the future.",

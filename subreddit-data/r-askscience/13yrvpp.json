Initially, they perceive speech as a form of communication that conveys emotions and intentions rather than specific words with meaning. As they develop and are exposed to language, they gradually start to recognize words and their meanings.",

            "comment": "Perception of the phonetic units of speech and concept of language is the name of the game.\n\n* Babies will start vocal imitation by age 20 weeks.\n\n* Age 6 months and the baby knows basics of speech sounds.  They are starting to understand the rules of language that some tones go up, other go down and the difference between the two is important.\n\n* [Age 8 months](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-babies-learn-language/) and the baby can start to predict which sounds go in which order to make a word.  For instance, Take the phrase \u201cpretty baby.\u201d The syllable \u201cpre\u201d is more likely to be heard with \u201cty\u201d than to accompany another syllable like \u201cba.\u201d  Play a tape of random sounds coupled together and the 8 month old can identify which combinations are language and which are noise.\n\n* [By age 10 months](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2947444/), differences can be discerned in the babbling of infants raised in different countries.  Your baby is already starting to get an accent.\n\nAt about the 10 month mark your child has \"learned\" all the phonemes in your spoken language.  Japanese infants lose the ability to distinguish between English r-l sounds between 8 and 10 months of age, they bundle it into a single sound/phoneme.  At the same time in development, American infants\u2019 discrimination of the same sounds shows an increase as they have lots of different \"r\" sounds.\n\nLanguage learning is multi-input process.  It requires sight, touch, response, play and all the stuff parents cannot help themselves from doing to a baby (e.g. goo-goo ga-ga, who's a good baaaaby/?)  Infants do not learn language from solely listening to tapes or video, so those baby Mandarin tapes aren't doing anything but providing white noise.",

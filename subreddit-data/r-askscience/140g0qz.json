But you will have friction and turbulent areas all along the interior surface of the tire and rim, which will slowly accelerate the air up to the tires new speed. But it is a lot messier than just the whole volume of air rotating. There will be lots of turbulence inside, especially when the tire changes speed.",

Around the 6:30 mark you can hear the inside of the tire.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/rILyBg7ZjeI\n\nOf course this is hugely dependent on the tire/vehicle system but tires typically deflect about an inch under load. That causes a pumping effect combined with the rotational effect.\n\nThis is why acoustic foam in tires is starting to be a thing. As vehicles get quieter, especially BEV vehicles, this \"cavity\" noise can become a problem in the cabin. It's around 200 hz depending on tire size. Best analogy I have ever heard is that it sounds like blowing air over an empty glass bottle.\n\nWhether or not you would hear it depends on the transmissibility of the entire system. Some vehicles are more sensitive to cavity noise; in many you couldn't even pick out cavity noise.\n\n...until you hear it, because you are a tire engineer, and now it's the only thing you can hear, and it drives your crazy :)",

If you can figure out the correct adhesive you could just glue in some random non-enfoneered foam and likely realize a difference. Or don't glue it and let it just spin around in the tire. (Disclaimer - I don't endorse that but...it should work lol)\n\nHowever, I'm guessing your problem is tread pattern noise and not cavity noise. Winter tires tend to have noisy patterns. \n\n*Generally* the presence of tire cavity noise in the cabin is due to the combination of the tire size and the transmissibility of the system. Assuming your non-winter tires don't make this noise, and they are the same or similar size, it's *probably* not cavity noise. (Different tires can result in different audible cavity noise in the cabin due to different tire transmissibility...but generally it is a function of tire size and vehicle transmissibility).\n\nCavity noise is typically triggered from road inputs, like broken asphalt, potholes, etc. Also cavity noise is a fixed frequency because it's a function of the contained air volume of the tire. \n\nTread pattern noise frequency will change with speed, and it can come in and out depending on resonance with the entire system. Pattern noise is best evaluated on a very smooth road. You could try a \"coast down\" on a smooth road, take your foot off the gas, radio off, listen to the noise. If the frequency decreases as your speed decreases, that's most likely pattern noise.",

                                            "comment": "So this sent me down a rabbit hole of thought. Assuming the air rotates with the tyre at steady state there's no net compression of the air and so no net work. However in the deformed zone of the tyre if the cross sectional area decreases the air must accelerate and decelerate through. Reynolds number gives us whether it's laminar or turbulent flow, in a round pipe:\n\nR = VD/v\n\nWhere:\n\n* R = Reynolds number\n* V = Average fluid velocity\n* D = Pipe diameter\n* v = kinematic viscosity\n\nWorking with Reynolds number of 2000 or less is laminar, we get VD=0.04 (roughly) for a tyre to have laminar flow. \n\nAssuming a triangular wedge of space is removed as the tyre compresses, then you end up with a divisor for tyre compression speed and air velocity. \n\nWorking with a 500mm diameter wheel with a 100mm thick tyre that compresses 20mm on the flat spot and eyeballing a 100mm long contact patch - this gives the sidewall inwards velocity of 2/5 of the rolling velocity (I think). The reduction in cross sectional area with the triangular wedge gives a 1/10 speed divisor. I also assumed actual compression would be 80% of the compression, since the tyre actually gets wider too. Putting that all together, 1/10x2/5x0.8 gives 0.032 speed factor. Using VD = 0.04 from earlier, with an 8cm compressed section, gives 0.5m/s critical flow speed inside the tyre. 0.5/0.032 = 15.6m/s = 56km/h.\n\nSo, yes, very approximate, but for this example I think the flow would be laminar until 56km/h. Different tyres would give very different results.\n\nEdit: I think I may be  a factor of two out and the turbulent speed would be 28km/h",

            "comment": "At steady state, meaning no change in rotational velocity of the tyre and after a \"long time\", yes. If the air was stationary in the tyre, the air right next to the tyrewall would undergo friction, so that air starts to move. Then the air next to that air would undergo friction from the air near the tyre.\n\nIn steady state the air inside the entire tyre would move at the same rotational velocity (rpm) \n\nNow I don't think this happens exactly ay regular highway driving, because the loads (non-steady-state forces) on the tyre will introduce turbulence, but that doesn't take away that the most energy efficient configuration is the one in which the air in the tyre rotates with the tyre, so that's the trend it will go towards, even if not fully following it.\n\nIf you want to learn more I suggest you read about \"transport phenomenon\" and specifically shear forces in fluids. The basic recipe is you set up a mass and energy balance of some tiny sliver (dr) of air in the tyre and just take tye limit as dr-&gt;0. If you've got a decent foundation in calculus you'll be able to follow allong pretty well. Since a tyre is rotationally symmetric, you won't even have to do (much) multivariate calculus, it's just lovely 1 dimensional (if you ignore the front and back of the tyre. Y'know, spherical cow and all that) \n\nA fun fact is that this is the mechanism by which (early, the declassified stuff) nuclear fuel enrichment works. You pump in gas (Uranium hexafluoride IIRC) into a rotating cylinder, and because of the shear forces the UF_6 gets spread out based on their mass.",

But the gas that makes contact with the inner wall of the tire will experience shearing forces that drag it in the direction of the tire rotation.  Eventually, these shearing forces will propagate to the inner gas molecules and the gas will all be rotating (on average) roughly the same speed as the tire.  Now the car comes to a stop.  The gasses will continue rotating until the opposite shear forces (drag) slow it down.",

As the wheel rotates, the edges will experience friction at the boundary layer which will slowly transfer energy from the wheel to the air speeding it up. When you stop, the air will keep going until the friction slows it down again.",

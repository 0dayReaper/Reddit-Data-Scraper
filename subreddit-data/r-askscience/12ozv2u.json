The more cells you have, the more gas exchange happens in the lungs. A large male uses more oxygen and thus emmits more Co2 via normal metabolism. \n\nInsects are effected by chemotaxis, or movement towards or away from stimuli. The higher the concentration of heat and co2 in the air, the more interest from moisquitos. \n\nI think your right that just speaking would not emmit more co2 than just breathing without speaking.",

But its mostly the 'Smell' you give off that has to do with metabolism, genes, bacteria biomes on skin, what you ate last, etc..

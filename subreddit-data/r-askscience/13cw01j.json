            "comment": "The main reason is because the Earth's atmosphere doesn't just \"end\" at any place, but instead gets thinner and thinner the higher up you get (it can be described by an exponential decay function quite accurately, actually). \n\nThus, all satellites orbiting the Earth will eventually need some station keeping, but the lower you are (like the ISS or Starlink) the more atmosphere there still is, and thus a little bit of drag slowing you down. \n\nAt the altitude of the ISS, the atmosphere is about 3E-10% (or 0.0000000003%) as thick as it is at the surface of the Earth which is enough for the [ISS to lose about 100 m a day of altitude due to atmospheric drag, and thus has to be re-boosted periodically](https://www.esa.int/Education/Space_In_Bytes/ATV_a_very_special_delivery_-_Lesson_notes).",

There are also effects due to the gravity of other planets and solar radiation pressure that might perturb a satellites orbit.\n\nMost satellites are in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The effects beside those from the atmosphere are basically negligible in that case.",

SpaceX lost track of them due to unpredictable drag and was not able to communicate with them. Since that time they implemented VHF (140 MHz) beacons that are easier to communicate with. The original beacons used frequencies around 12 GHz and required a 5 m directional antenna that had to be pointed directly at a satellite to receive signal.",

And yes, it does affect the orbit to the extent that satellites need to correct for it every now and then.\n\nSomething else I didn't mention is just errors in the final orbit of a satellite. A satellite may need to be in geostationary orbit so that it does not move relative to the ground and appears to be fixed in the sky. If the satellite has a slightly higher or lower orbit it will slowly drift in the sky over time until it appears to be in a totally different part of the sky. This can occur even if there are no other effects perturbing the orbit. So that's another reason a satellite would need thrusters for station keeping.",

In much higher orbits such as geostationary (~36,000 km) and the medium Earth orbits (MEO) of GPS (~20,000 km), atmospheric drag is entirely negligible.\n\nThese higher orbiting satellites still require regular station keeping so they stay in their intended orbits, because of gravitational perturbations caused by the Moon and Sun, and the not-perfectly-spherical Earth (and to a much lesser degree, radiation pressure from solar wind and sunlight).",

At 400 km. the garbage does not stay at that level for long as it is being pulled to a lower orbit due to the slight drag from the molecules of air. Eventually the junk burns up in the atmosphere.",

Drag is proportional to cross sectional area, but the rate of deceleration (and thus altitude loss) depends on mass.  The ISS has a much lower mass per unit of cross sectional area than a solid object like a bolt, paint chip, or unmanned  satellite. \n\nThink about dropping a ping pong ball and a golf ball out of your car window while driving down the highway.  Both have about the same cross sectional area, but as the ping pong ball is so much lighter, it's going to slow down way, way faster.",

In fact, the Moon is slowly moving away from the Earth. This is actually due to a different reason, as the tidal bulge from the Earth gives a slight tug to the Moon, putting it into a slightly higher orbit, and slowing it down. ~~as the energy in the Moon's orbit is slowly being sapped away by tidal forces (the energy to make the tides on Earth come from the Moon's orbit)~~. The Moon is getting about 4 cm (or 1.5 inches) further away from the Earth a year.\n\n**Edit**: corrected due to someone below pointing out my error.

That means they have less kinetic energy, but higher gravitational potential energy.\n\nWhat's actually happening is that the tides, effectively, move more mass closer to the moon as it passes overhead. This increases the gravitational force between the two. However, since the Earth rotates much faster than the moon orbits, the Earth basically pulls the moon slightly faster as it rotates. This causes the moon to slightly increase in orbital distance, trading velocity for height. Since this process is more or less constant, we don't change the ellipticalness of the orbit, we just end up adding to the height, at the expense of a little bit of rotational energy from the Earth.\n\nTL;DR - water bulges towards the moon, slightly increasing the gravitational attraction to the moon. Earth pulls the moon faster as it rotates, Earth slows down slightly. Due to orbital mechanics, moon slows down by gaining a slightly higher orbit.",

This makes it seem like getting to orbit requires a very precise control of altitude and speed, or you'll either fall back to Earth or fly away infinitely far. But that's not how it works.\n\nIf you're going a little too slow, your path will deviate from a circle and approach Earth, speeding up as it does so, like any falling object. By the time you reach the opposite side of Earth, you will have dropped so low, and sped up so much, that you're now going faster than the \"circular orbit speed\" for that altitude. As a result, your path starts climbing away from Earth, and you slow down, just like a ball thrown upward. In the absence of atmospheric drag, you'll end up at the same altitude and speed where you started, and your orbit will form an ellipse whose low end (perigee) is lower than your starting altitude.\n\nSimilarly, if you're going too fast for a circular orbit, you'll travel in an ellipse whose high point (apogee) is higher than your starting altitude. Of course there are limits -- if your perigee is low enough you'll reenter, and if your speed is fast enough (double the circular orbit speed, IIRC) you will leave orbit and travel to deep space. But precise control isn't needed to get \"into orbit\" -- it's only needed if you care exactly where your orbit goes.",

This is because the distance in the gravity equation is based on distance from the center of the Earth, not distance from surface. \n\nInstead, atmospheric pressure is mainly based on the weight of the atmosphere above you squishing you down. So, the further down you go, the more weight there is. [This easy to read paper explains exactly how you get the exponential](https://people.clas.ufl.edu/kees/files/AtmosphericPressure.pdf).",

Something as simple as flying over a mountain can cause you to be knocked off course.\n\nEven smaller effects will be due to the gravity of distant planets like Jupiter, and also the solar wind - which is strong enough to make a sail out of if your satellite is particularly small.",

            "comment": "Depends. Within 1000-2000 kilometers of earth, various forms of drag exist -- the closer down, the more drag. A 2000 km orbit is stable on the order of a few thousand years or so.\n\nA 10,000km orbit, or a 30,000km orbit, should be stable for hundreds of thousands or millions of years respectively. Obviously the Moon will be a lot more stable than that. (Altho here, \"stable\" is relative, and I only meant as far as \"staying in orbit\". A commercial comms sat, in geostationary orbit at 36,000km, requires station-keeping fuel to stay at precisely the right spot, otherwise it slowly drifts from the perfect spot over months and years. But it will stay in orbit for millions of years.)\n\nOn other hand, some orbits aren't \"orbits\" at all in the Keplerian sense: orbits in the vicinity of a Lagrange point, for example, are in fact only pseudo orbits; near L1, L2, and L3 in particular, a body would drift away from the L point over the course of mere months. That's why JWST, among others, requires a substantial load of station-keeping fuel as well. But this has nothing to do with drag or with remaining in orbit around the primary body, only to do with staying  near the relative L point.",

You need to be travelling sideways very fast to do this. \n\nIf you collide with anything, even a little bit of air, you slow down your sideways speed. This in turn allows you to get closer to the surface. This then allows you to run into more air which, in turn slows you down, etc. \n\nTo prevent this, you need to add more speed keep moving sideways fast enough. This is accomplished by periodic, controlled bursts of thrust.",

            "comment": "A lot of posts are focusing on LEO satellites and the fact that satellites can naturally deorbit due to atmospheric drag when they're close to earth.\n\nHEO/MEO/GEO satellites also need to perform station keeping, and the reason is that there are many factors influencing their orbit that add up over time, including precession and nutation. But these satellites are still designed to do a specific job and as their orbit 'drifts' due to various factors, they need to do station keeping burns to keep them near the orbital regime they're designed for.\n\nMolniya orbits are a type of HEO (Highly Elliptical Orbit) where the perigee is likely in LEO altitudes while the apogee may be even further out than the GEO belt. HEO orbits are impacted by atmospheric drag just like LEO satellites, but on a more periodic basis. These kinds of orbits are often used for comms satellites and so not only are they station keeping to maintain orbital altitude to avoid crashing into earth, but they're also maintaining their relative resonance with other satellites in the same constellation.\n\nGPS satellites are a type of MEO satellite and they also do station keeping, as is [explained here](https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/30752/do-operating-gps-satellites-ever-make-orbital-maneuvers-for-station-keeping). The idea of a repeating ground track is important not only for GPS satellites but also many other types of satellites. If a mission can create a detailed plan for 'n' number of orbits, and every 'n' number of orbits will trace the exact same ground track as the previous 'n' orbits and the next 'n' orbits, then its easier to do mission planning. \n\nGeostationary satellites also do station keeping that's on the order of 50 m/s delta-V per year, and they do it so that they can maintain a relatively constant position relative to the surface of earth. Otherwise their orbital plane would precess relative to earth and the object you put above one part of the earth would eventually be above a different part. There's also a change in inclination that happens over time. So even though atmopsheric drag is absolutely negligible at GEO altitudes, they need to do station keeping burns to make sure that they stay in relatively the same place above earth.",

            "comment": "As others have said, most satellites orbit at an altitude where they are essentially in space. However, the Earth\u2019s atmosphere doesn\u2019t just end a certain distance above the surface; instead it wavers thinner and thinner until it is indistinguishable from the space around it. At the altitude these satellites orbit at, There is still an extremely thin atmosphere. As such, the satellites collide with more particles and slowly decelerate, which causes the effect to snowball as the orbit gets smaller. In order to stop this, we must intermittently apply thrust to compensate for the loss in angular momentum around the planet so that the orbital distance can be maintained.",

            "comment": "Short answer, thrust is required for prolonged orbit. \n\nHave you ever seen one of these [rolling coin donation bins](https://youtu.be/XTipCQxJ6Ak)?\n\nThe coins start off with a boost of energy as they fall down the tiny ramp, which allows them to orbit and avoid falling into the center of the funnel. Unfortunately, friction gradually reduces the tangential velocity of the coins, and they eventually fall, because they have no way to gain additional thrust.\n\nThe curved funnel can be a simplified analogy for gravity pulling a satellite towards ground, while the entry ramp represents the entry into orbit, and friction against the plastic is analogous to air resistance against the satellite.\n\nThe air resistance gradually slows the satellite, so to maintain orbit you need to periodically add thrust until eventually the fuel is exhausted and it can no longer escape Earth's gravitational pull.\n\nIn the coin analogy, there are a few things you'd need to do to allow a coin to spin longer without falling. You could accelerate the coin to make up for the energy lost to friction. You could eliminate friction so it doesn't slow down. And you could start the coin higher up and farther from the bottom, so that it feels less pull towards the center.\n\nFor a satellite, that's adding thrust periodically, orbiting at an altitude with thinner atmosphere, or orbiting farther away where gravity is weaker. But gravity is also what maintains your round orbit, so you can't escape Earth's gravity completely. So you pick an orbit with sufficient gravitational pull, balanced with low enough air resistance that you don't burn your fuel too quickly.",

            "comment": "There's also a really cool effect that applies to satellites which need to point in a direction other than the centre of the earth. Consider a really long, tube-like satellite with a centre of mass (where gravity appears to act through) right in the middle. Consider that one end will be slightly closer to earth than the other, and hence will experience a slightly larger gravitational force. An object will always rotate about its centre of mass (more accurately its centre of inertia), and usually in a constant gravitational field, this automatically means the gravitational force either side of the centre of mass is equal. Here however, one half of its mass will appear to be dragged by earth with more force than the other, creating a rotation. To correct this, fuel is needed. Note that this is independent of shape/volume, but it's easier to think about with something that's long, as the effect is exaggerated.\n\nIf you fancy looking it up, key terms like 'gravitational torque' and 'gravitational gradient' may be useful.",

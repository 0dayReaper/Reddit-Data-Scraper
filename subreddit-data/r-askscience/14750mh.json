    "postText": "Basically, regarding the ancestor common to tarantulas and all other web-making spiders - I read that their LCA came out of the sea and only then evolved silk spinning abilities. So do tarantulas and other non-web making spiders ever have that ability?. Or did some evolve web spinning and then lose it?\n\nAlso, I was reading about spinnerets and the like. Do non-web making spiders use those glands for something else?",

            "comment": "Tarantulas haven't *lost* their ability to to make silk, they just don't weave webs anymore having specialised in capturing prey using different methods. However it's this sort of change which leads to the loss of unnecessary abilities, resulting in speciation: long-term evolution. But right now they still have working spinnerettes which still get used.",

It's an interest but not a specialty for me.\n\nProblem numero uno, you're going to have to define 'complex'. There's so much differentiation when it comes to just webs: basic spiral, reversing spiral, webs with additional bits changed every few days so that prey don't recognise them, nets used for fishing, diving bells, trap doors for burrowing ctenizid\u00e6, and so on.",

You could maybe pull something like that off for this species. However, this is an an old world species and not recommended for inexperienced keepers. They are faster, more defensive, and have stronger venom than the new world tarantulas most commonly kept as pets. The venom won't kill you, but it will be extremely unpleasant if you get bitten.\n\nI don't know if there is any other species of tarantula that likes to swim. If the pond is extremely shallow and not a drowning risk, it might be fine for a species that enjoys high moisture levels.",

They will attach it with a hinge made of web so that the leaf opens and closes like a door.    This gives them protection from predators.  Plus, because the leaf looks like normal ground clutter, the spider can [hide behind the trapdoor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ui0hbv3wVs) and ambush insects that pass by.",

Within the modern, monophyletic paradigm, a clade just means a group of species which includes a given ancestor and all of its descendant species. *Homo* is a clade: all species within *Homo* share a common ancestor (even if we don\u2019t have a crystal clear picture of which species that was) and none of the species we include within *Homo* have lineages which do not include that common ancestor. \u201cFish\u201d on the other hand is not a clade, at least not in common parlance, because it cannot be shown as one branch in the tree of life with a single stem and all descendant branches from that point. If we discovered that some species currently grouped within *Homo* actually didn\u2019t descend from that presumed common ancestor (for example, perhaps *Homo naledi* actually descends from a sister taxa the australopithecine that we descend from), then we would adjust the picture and that species would no longer be considered part of *Homo*, it would either be grouped into another parallel clade, or a new one could be conceived for it. Obviously this process is not perfect and omniscient, and as biologists we don\u2019t pretend it is.\n\nRemember the true point of cladistics is not to group similarities in physiology or appearance, but to establish ancestry.",

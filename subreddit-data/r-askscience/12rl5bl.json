    "postText": "Hi, I hope this is the right category for a paleoclimate question.\n\nThere are various reconstructions of past global temperatures based on geological proxy evidence. There are some reconstructions going back 540 million years, though they get less certain as they go further back in time.\n\nBut it would be really interesting to know how the Snowball Earth events compared to later temperatures. And what the temperatures were like generally during the Proterozoic and Archean. (I already tried Google but couldn't find much.)\n\nI understand there is less evidence for those times. I know they can't use shell isotopes because there were no hard shells. Still, I'm wondering if there has been any work done to figure out how temperature evolved before the Phanerozoic?",

            "comment": "Geologist here, though paleoclimate is nowhere near my specialization (I'm a structural field geologist). A quick google search delivered [this](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/dujs/2010/05/30/oceans-of-ice-the-snowball-earth-theory-of-global-glaciation/) result, which is a really interesting review of the Snowball Earth theory circa 2010. The review has a solid set of references to check out and branch from. [This](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013083118) is a good technical article on constraining Paleozoic temperature fluctuations. If you're stuck behind paywalls in your hunt for the references, try [this](https://libgen.is/) website; the search tool is not the best but it has helped me heaps over the years. Anna's Archives is another good site.\n\n[This](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/32075449) book is a great read. It doesn't zero in on the topic of paleoclimate; it discusses the six major extinction events that have punctuated life over the last 550M years, and the geological and extraterrestrial events that precipitated them. Excellent interviews and travel stories with paleontology and geology specialists, well written and entertaining. Also, it is great for providing a bit of a sense of scale for the amount of time we're dealing with - but even then, it covers only the most recent half a billion years of earth history.\n\nAs to global temperature trends during the Proterozoic and Archaean, the question kind of starts to lose relevance when we step that far back in time, in part because the data one needs are sparse at best, but also because planetary dynamics were almost unfathomably foreign. For example, a key thing to note is that the atmosphere, once it existed, had a completely different composition for the first two billion or so years of earth's history - see the Great Oxidation Event, [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23286-7) and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/great-oxygenation-event). Discussion of paleoclimate dynamics is seated in a wildly different context - life in only its earliest, nascent states, very different global hydrodynamic systems, very different rates and processes of erosion. The earth itself was also hotter, internally - see komatiitic lavas, [here](https://www.alexstrekeisen.it/english/vulc/komatiites.php) and [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/komatiite), for example. And after the GOE, atmospheric composition continued to fluctuate; see [here](https://news.berkeley.edu/2018/01/03/which-came-first-complex-life-or-high-atmospheric-oxygen/). So objective climate temperature measurements can be derived, to a point, but consideration of their context matters very much as well.\n\nWhat I'm driving at is that the scale of changes quickly grows beyond our conventional scope. We are (very justifiably) concerned with temperature fluctuations in the range of 2-4 degrees in the span of hundreds of years. In contrast, since the end of the [Proterozoic](https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/GSA/timescale/home.aspx), global temperature trends have fluctuated by much larger ranges, by up to an [order of magnitude](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013083118) larger, and these fluctuations took place on an earth that barely to eventually only kind of looked like the planet we're living on now. Stepping even further back, Earth's tectonic dynamics, atmospheric dynamics, hydrodynamics, magnetodynamics, everything was so different that the exercise of extrapolating temperature change kind of loses relevance. Discussion of temperature fluctuations that far back requires thoughtful meditation on the context in which those temperature fluctuations were occuring.\n\nJust for fun, [this](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geosphere/article/3/4/220/31158/Tectonic-model-for-the-Proterozoic-growth-of-North) is a brilliant article on the evolution of the North American continent: it steps through time at the scale of accretion of the major tectonic components that make up the continent as we know it today. However, it is Critical to acknowledge that the model is presented always within the context of the geometry of the current continental structure, without consideration of their/its true location on the surface of the planet. All of these tectonic puzzle pieces were essentially drifting their way around the surface of the planet, both as independent pieces and later as coherent, accreted terranes. This is continuing today - tectonics is still very much active and the plates continue to drift across the surface. Point being, all of these tectonic puzzle pieces have existed at very different latitudes and longitudes throughout their existence, and the climate itself has also changed wildly throughout this history. It's kind of staggering to ponder the immensity of the difference of the planet's geology between then and now, let alone the life that geology hosted, and the climate that existed above.",

                    "comment": "Having worked on paleoclimate I can confirm the accuracy of this answer.\n\nTo add a bit more flavour to it:  our current best temperature records are isotope &amp; atomic ratios.  We find physical and chemical processes making stratified materials that change with temperature (typically that hotter temperatures make atoms move faster and faster movement means fat, heavy atoms or isotopes are less disadvantaged in reactions).\n\nThese include Oxy18 ratio in ice, Mg/Ca in planktonic foraminifera and Sr/Ca in corals.  All of these temperature scales were calibrated by lab experiments and modern day samples in-situ.\n\nWe can use these on the lifespan of ice (up to about 700k in deep Antarctica), or oldest carbonate-shelled forams and corals (roughly Silurian and Cambrian, although we have to be concerned about any post-deposition alterations that could change isotope ratios and whether the biological efficiency of carbonate creation has stayed constant over so long and whether that impacts the measurement of temperature from atom ratios).\n\nBut the Cambrian only gets us back to 550Ma.  To go back further we need to find something else in the rock record that survives in the tiny amount of pre-Cambrian bedrock we have available to us and is indicative of temperature.  That is very very hard to do.\n\nAs of today I don't think we have a good measure of temperature in any snowball Earth event.  I believe the best evidence is fossil moraines suggesting glaciers near the tropics.\n\nI certainly agree that it is hard to model historical temperatures that far back.  Even reconstructing Pleistocene Ice Age temperatures through simulation is difficult.",

                    "comment": "Thanks, I'll take a look through those links!\n\nThe Paleozoic study looks interesting despite not being the time period I asked about. I don't know what to believe about the Cambrian though. [I've already read another study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348351275_Phanerozoic_Paleotemperatures_The_Earth%27s_Changing_Climate_during_the_Last_540_million_years) arguing the Cambrian temperatures are implausibly high. The Permian-Triassic extinction happened when equatorial ocean temperatures rose above 35-40C, so how did life survive in the Cambrian if it was 40-50C? It was clearly a very warm period but was it really that severe? Do you have a view on this?\n\nAnd I didn't mean to downplay all the non-temperature changes over Earth's history.\n\nBut getting back to the Snowball Earth, from what I understand, there seem to be several different models:\n\n* [A snowball](https://opengeology.org/historicalgeology/case-studies/snowball-earth/) \\-50C globally and -40C at the equator, causing a deep freeze globally and making it hard to understand how life survived.\n* [A slushball](https://web.gps.caltech.edu/~wfischer/pubs/Ewingetal2014.pdf) well below freezing globally, but just below freezing at the equator, causing equatorial seasonal melting and freezing.\n* [An incomplete glaciation](https://people.climate.columbia.edu/projects/view/1430) \\-13C globally, but with the equator 11C and ice-free.\n* [A high axial tilt](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S167498711600030X) with the equator experiencing a 40C variation between seasons, causing equatorial seasonal melting and freezing.\n\nIs there a consensus around any one of these theories? Which has the most supporting evidence? Or is it still an entirely open question?\n\nI also found two studies ([here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345791581_Quantifying_temperature_variation_between_Neoproterozoic_cryochron_-_nonglacial_interlude_Nanhua_Basin_South_China/link/5fae0b8d4585150781136ef2/download) and [here](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020AV000244)) claiming the equatorial temperature dropped 20-30C from the Tonian to the Sturtian. The former study says the Gaskiers glaciation was 8C warmer (which if a more normal glaciation might mean similar to [the Last Glacial Maximum's 8C](https://news.ucar.edu/132755/scientists-nail-down-average-temperature-last-ice-age), making the Sturtian just below 0C?). But then the latter study seems to say the temperature was still 25C in the Sturtian! How can that be right?\n\nIt's all quite confusing to my layperson's eyes. Is there something I'm not understanding, or are the experts as confused as I am?",

Very simple animals like sponges go back to 700 million years, and probably before then. Animals with hard shells or exoskeletons evolved in the late Ediacaran and \"exploded\" in the Cambrian.\n\nOlder soft-bodied animals were less likely to be preserved, and the further back you go the more likely geologic activity has destroyed fossils anyway. When multicellular life began is not only complicated by the sparseness and ambiguity inherent to the fossil record, but what you would consider truly multicellular life even if you had a liver version to study. Even today, there are colonies of single-celled bacteria, single-celled slime molds that aggregate together into a single mass, and (unambiguusly multicelular, if primitive) sea sponges capable of reintegrating themselves if ground up into bits of intact cells.\n\nA ~1 billion year old fossilized [ball of cells](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.livescience.com/amp/billion-year-old-fossil-animal-evolution.html) appears to have been differentiated into two types of cells. Other possibilities for the first multicellular life date to over 2 billion years ([this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.wired.com/2010/06/early-multicellularity/amp) and [this](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/02/190213124356.htm)). Evidence of coordination between single-celled bacteria\\* goes back to 3 billion years or more.\n\nIt should also be noted that multicelularity evolved independently at different times to different lineages: animals, (land) plants,\nmultiple times for algae and fungi, etc. Some multicellular fungi and algae, and perhaps even simple animals, reverted back to unicellular.\n\nThere are [multicellular prokaryotes](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/lab-rat/bacteria-with-bodies-multicellular-prokaryotes/) (which make up a tiny minority of all prokaryotes). This includes some cyanobacteria, which have evolved multicellularity (and switched back to unicellular) multiple times. Cyanobacteria have oxygenated Earth starting with the Great Oxygenation Event 2-2.5 billion years ago, and multicellularity in cyanobacteria may have evolved by around that time ([Schirrmeister et al., 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3271361/); [Schirrmeister et al., 2013](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1209927110)). (But, sure, nearly all multicellular life is eukaryotic. That should not be mistaken to imply that all eukaryotic life is multicellular--far from it.)",

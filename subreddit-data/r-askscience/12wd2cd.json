A latin square design was used to randomize the test subjects for possible individual differences for mosquito attraction. Repellency was evaluated as the percentage protection. Deet was included in the study for comparison. All the plant products manifested repellency. At 50% concentration at which the highest repellency was recorded the protection was 91.6%, 87.0%, 96.0%, 97.9% for rue, neem, pyrethrum and deet, respectively. The essential oil of lemon eucalyptus was not tried at this concentration. At a 40% concentration deet, lemon eucalyptus and pyrethrum were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) more effective than rue and neem. At a 50% concentration, deet and pyrethrum were significantly better (p &lt; 0.05) than rue and neem. At a 75% concentration concentration, deet and lemon eucalypus performed significantly better (p &lt; 0.05) than pyrethrum and neem. The difference between pyrethrum and neem was also significant (p &lt; 0.01).\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12672146/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12672146/)\n\n&gt;MyggA Natural (Bioglan, Lund, Sweden) is a commercially available repellent against blood-feeding arthropods. It contains 30% of lemon-scented eucalyptus, Corymbia citriodora (Hook.) K. D. Hill &amp; L. A. S. Johnson (Myrtaceae), oil with a minimum of 50% p-menthane-3,8-diol. MyggA Natural also contains small amounts of the essential oils of lavender, Lavandula angustifolia Mill. (Lamiaceae), and geranium, Pelargonium graveolens L'Her. (Geraniaceae). In laboratory bioassays, MyggA Natural and C. citriodora oil exhibited 100% repellency against host-seeking nymphs of Ixodes ricinus (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae). Lavender oil and geranium oil, when diluted to 1% in 1,2-propanediol, had weak repellent activities on I. ricinus nymphs, but when diluted to 30% in 1,2-propanediol had 100% repellencies. 1,2-Propanediol (100%) had no significant repellent activity in comparison with that of the control. In field tests in tick-infested areas in central Sweden, tick repellency of MyggA Natural and C. citriodora oil was tested by the blanket-dragging technique for 4 d during a 6-d period. The repellencies (74 and 85%, respectively) on day 1 are similar (89%) to that of blankets treated in a similar manner with 19% diethyl-methyl-benzamide, based on previous work. Repellencies declined significantly from day 1 to day 6 (74 to 45% for MyggA Natural; 85 to 42% for C. citriodora oil).\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16892632/",

In Africa we eat a lot of Sorghum (as porridge and a drink), so there is a market for it, but I'm sure in the US even if no one knows what Sorghum is nor eats it, it could probably be used for animal feed. However, the cost/benefit might not be worth it, as we know Cargill and Monsanto will happily nuke corn with pesticides to avoid these issues anyway.\n\nThere are a few other relationships like this that I know of, and probably many many more still.\n\nCarrots and onions are often planted together because the onions deter the carrot fly, which can damage the carrots. The carrots can help break up soil and create channels for water to flow to the onion roots.\n\nGarlic can be planted around the base of roses to deter aphids and other pests. \n\nTomatoes and basil have a symbiotic relationship. The strong scent of basil repels tomato hornworms, which are a common pest for tomato plants, while also attracting beneficial insects like bees and butterflies that help to pollinate tomato flowers. On the flip side, the tomato plant secretes a chemical that can help to repel pests that may attack the basil plant.",

Without a high air concentration they're not going to be effected by deterrents.",

Even a ton of catnip near the patio isn't going to just blind mosquitoes tracking all people. But I do wonder if there's any mosquito research specialists that look at this methodology:\n\n&gt;Peterson put groups of 20 mosquitoes in a two-foot glass tube, half of which was treated with nepetalactone. After 10 minutes, only an average of 20 percent \u2014 about four mosquitoes \u2014 remained on the side of the tube treated with a high dose (1.0 percent) of the oil. In the low-dose test (0.1 percent) with nepetalactone, an average of 25 percent \u2014 five mosquitoes \u2014 stayed on the treated side. The same tests with DEET (diethyl-m-toluamide) resulted in approximately 40 percent to 45 percent \u2014 eight-nine mosquitoes \u2014 remaining on the treated side.\n\nThey're trying to test for a literal repellant, as in smells bad enough to make mosquitoes keep away, which is fine. But then comparing that to DEET is actually pretty deliberately misleading, because that's NOT how DEET works. DEET works by masking human scent, not by discouraging mosquitoes from being in the area. Mosquitoes will be all around you with DEET, but they won't be able to see you, you're basically scent camoflaged.\n\nBasically, nepetalactone being 10 times better than DEET at repelling doesn't mean it's good at repelling, because DEET doesn't repel mosquitoes that way anyway. Ten times a small number is still going to be small?",

If you plant them around plants you want insects to avoid, they\u2019re quite effective as they\u2019re aromatic, meaning they release their poisonous oils into the air.  Insects will avoid that harsh environment if they have a better option elsewhere.\n\nIf you have a hyperventilating naked human standing in a yard ringed with chrysanthemums, you\u2019re going to still be attracting most of the mosquitoes nearby.\n\nIf that naked person was lying in a bed of mums, having rubbed themselves in the flowers, you might get a few adventurous mosquitoes, but most would just look for something better.\n\nThis made me think\u2026 has anyone created a mosquito variation on a bug zapper?  Tricks them into thinking a surface is a food source when it\u2019s actually high voltage?",

These oils act as natural insecticides and can help to repel mosquitoes, flies, fleas, and other insects from the surrounding area. However, the effectiveness of plants as insect repellents may vary depending on factors such as the location, climate, plant variety, and insect species.",

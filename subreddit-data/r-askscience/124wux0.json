            "comment": "With humans specifically, a lot of it has to do with dispersal and competitive niche exclusion. \n\nCompetitive niche exclusion means that you can't (usually, there are some exceptions) have two species occupying the same biological niche.  A niche is a way of making a living...the foods you eat, the places you nest, the times you are active, etc.  Other hominids were similar to humans, and modern humans have a very broad niche (we eat a lot of different things, live in a lot of different places, etc).  \n\nSo it's not surprising that there's no other surviving hominids where humans are...you'd expect us to push them out of their niches.   Earlier hominids seem to have narrower niches and so could survive alongside each other  in some cases.   And often, animal species occupy narrow niches that allow them to avoid competing, for example similar species of fish may specialize in living in different parts of a lake.  So you get a lake full of several species of sunfish, for example, where one eats snails on the bottom, another eats bugs in the shoreline plants, and another eats plankton in the middle of the lake.  \n\nThe other relevant factor is dispersal.  Humans are very good at dispersing.  Of course, you can fly around the world in a jet today, but even 10000 years ago we had walked or boated almost across the whole planet.  And people didn't _stop_ moving once they got to new places, people kept moving around between most of these populations.  Most species aren't this good at dispersing, so you get one species here and another similar species there, and you wind up with a bunch of similar species in different parts of the world, originating from isolated populations.  People just move around too much for this to happen.  \n\nHumans aren't unique, there are other species where there are no other similar animals for various reasons, but this why humans wound up this way.",

Part of the reason is because of how well we adapted to a rapidly changing earth in the ice age. What seems like simple accomplishments now were monumental then, making ranged weapons, tighter fitting clothing, and being omnivores helped us dominate. The most famous cousin to us was Homo neanderthalensis, which were specialized in hunting big game. This hunting practice may of made them less adaptive and they had to travel great distances just to eat, which may of lead to their demise.",

We caused the Neanderthals to go extinct. Chimps are our closest genetic relatives. No doubt other branches started but lacked enough sufficient distance from Humans to develop further.\n\nAlso, complex organisms tend to produce less variety since a single mutation can kill off a new branch before it starts. A positive effect mutation is very rare. Then add to that the fact that humans create one offspring over nine months while simpler organisms can produce millions or billions within that same period and you have a much wider practice of evolution among simpler species which will end up producing a wide variety of very close cousins to a given species.\n\nIn terms of our evolutionary future, it's impossible to predict. But with the advent of world travel being so accessible to just about anyone these days and as that becomes even more accessible to people, our skin tones will homogenize towards some shade of brown most likely. White-skinned people will be a relatively short-lived expression of human in the context of our evolutionary development. Also, any serious morphological changes that might happen to us will take multiple generations for them to manifest in a way that \"stands out\". Such changes will happen without any human being able to detect the change without referencing ancient human periodicals... while DNA science might be the best chance for us to find changes that are \"in progress\" as it were ... but evolution works the fastest when an allele frequency change has an opportunity to flourish within a smaller isolated pocket of existence without any genetic influence from outside that small isolated group, so then our eventual evolution will take a long long long time before any significant change happens then spreads throughout our total population. Also, a human-related branch is unlikely to happen at this point... we're too well connected all over the planet, and so then the opportunity for an isolated mutated expression will have little to no chance to flourish within a pocket / isolated group of evolving humans. We would have to branch out and start habituating other planets at this point to see any significant human evolution that results in a species that can no longer produce offspring with humans.",

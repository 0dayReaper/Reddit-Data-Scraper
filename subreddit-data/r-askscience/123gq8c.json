However, researchers are aware that maintaining the double blind nature of the study is necessary to properly evaluate medical outcomes, and we do everything possible to ensure the quality of our research is unadulterated. Think of it this way: why would we want to invalidate years of work?",

The subject doesn\u2019t know if they are getting the new drug being investigated, an old drug that\u2019s the usual treatment, or a placebo. But because it\u2019s NOT double blind, the researcher DOES know which bottle contained which medication and which patient gets each one. Now even if he tries really hard to be objective and impartial, he might accidentally rate one group as limping less on the treatment he thinks is going to work best, or he might avoid giving the placebo to someone he feels sorry for and wants to make sure is getting a real treatment, and accidentally skew the groups so it\u2019s not a fair comparison. \n\nIf the same experiment were run as a double-blind experiment, one researcher or team will divide the participants into *randomized* groups and pass out the medication\u2014 and if at all possible that medication will be formulated to appear identical (each dose is 2 capsules of the same size and color, for example, no matter what\u2019s inside them), and once they\u2019ve told the participants the instructions for how to take the meds and what surveys to fill out to track their progress and when they need to come back for rechecks with the doctor(s), they\u2019re done for now. An entirely different researcher or team will actually collect the data, and they will have absolutely no idea who is getting what. So in order to fudge the results they would need to break into the other team\u2019s files and sneak a peek at the list of who got what, but that\u2019s deliberate cheating at that point, not unconscious bias.\n\nHowever: you\u2019re not wrong that\u2014 like life in general\u2014 there are a LOT of ways very subtle unconscious bias can slip into the process (who gets recruited for the study, for example\u2014 do you only advertise in certain neighborhoods? In certain languages? And so on\u2026) I just did a search for \u201cexperimental design to avoid bias\u201d and there was no one particular great link to point you at because there were MANY resources and webinars and publications, meant to train university and medical researchers and also to look back and evaluate any bias that might only be obvious in hindsight, the better to avoid it in future.",

Typically a third person who is not involved in data collection or analysis is the one who was aware of the group labels. \n\nTo do properly, during the initial statistical analysis to groups are also done blinded. For example you label them groups a, b, c. Only after you have performed statistical analysis of the effects of the intervention, for example, then do you afterwards get to unblind\n\nSo it can happen you have what looks like a very nice effect, and then realize that it's the placebo group we got better!

A blind study is one in which the participant doesn't know if they are getting the the study drug (or procedure or whatever) or if they're getting a placebo. A double-blind study is one in which the participant and the tasked researcher both don't know whether the participant is getting the drug or the placebo. In all cases the participant must know what the purpose of the drug is and any negative effects taking it or not taking it may have.",

After the potential subject passes the screening process (to ensure they are a good candidate and meet all inclusion criteria), we log into a program that gives us the code number for the box to give the subject.  The distribution of numbers is predetermined.  No one really knows what is distributed. \n\nFWIW,  fraud - if it exists - has nothing to do with the desired outcome. It is the result of the financial motivation to enroll subjects, which can be significant. Most of the  unsavory activity is from greedy sites enrolling unqualified or even phony people.",

Most trials have dozens of independent locations that have little to connection with each other. Typically, the pharmaceutical company contracts with a 'clinical research organization' (CRO) to coordinate it all. The CRO usually uses a separate system and/or company to perform randomization. And the whole thing is potentially monitored by yet another separate agency and subject to legal scrutiny and penalties for wrongdoing by the FDA.

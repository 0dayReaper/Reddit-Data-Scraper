This can be measured, so time drift in comparison can also be measured.",

Any individual clock is noisy but one can try to average many clocks to build a reference standard. The standard we tend to use is [International Atomic Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Time), from which other timekeeping standards like UTC are derived. The wiki page says it well: \"Due to the signal averaging TAI is an order of magnitude more stable than its best constituent clock.\" One can compare the single clock to the reference standard with some quantity like the [Allan variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_variance).",

            "comment": "In physics experiments, a \"clock\" is essentially a machine that outputs an oscillation whose frequency is very stable. The stability of that frequency is measured using something called the \"allen deviation\" [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan\\_variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_variance). The measurement of your own clock's allen deviation is usually achieved by comparing it to another clock, or to someone else's clock, by having satellites send precisely timed signals to both clocks at once, and having each researcher tell each other what time they were measuring when they got that signal.\n\nThe second is defined as a certain number of oscillations of the frequency that excites a certain transition in the cesium atom. This is measured using a cesium fountain clock, which has an allen deviation near 10\\^-15 s/s (i.e. the clock's reported time will be inaccurate by at most 10\\^-15\\*the time that the clock runs) [https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/1999/12/nist-f1-cesium-fountain-clock](https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/1999/12/nist-f1-cesium-fountain-clock)Essentially the cesium fountain clock is always outputting some frequency, and to prevent that output frequency from drifting, its continuously checking that its output frequency is still the perfect frequency to excite that transition in cesium.\n\nSo if you want to measure how long some process takes really precisely, you make or buy a cesium fountain clock (\\~1 million usd/eur), and you measure how many times the cesium fountain's output frequency oscillates during your process. More likely, you use the cesium fountain clock to measure another frequency.\n\nOr you have your own cheaper clock, like a quartz oscillator or an active hydrogen maser [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen\\_maser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_maser) and you use satellite signals to check that clock against other peoples'  cesium fountain clocks\n\nToday, there are clocks operating on a similar principle as the cesium fountain clock that are more accurate (have lower Allen deviation). But we don't want to be constantly changing the definition of the second and making scientists around the world update their labs to accommodate this. So we stick with the cesium fountain clock, which was a well established technology at the time that the second was defined in SI units (1983). The current definitions of the second and other quantities is found here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019\\_redefinition\\_of\\_the\\_SI\\_base\\_units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_redefinition_of_the_SI_base_units)",

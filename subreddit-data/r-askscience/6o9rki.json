            "comment": "You mean \"micro gravity\" as \"anti-gravity\" is more of a science fiction term ([micro-gravity is NASA's term](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-microgravity-58.html) about living and working in/on spacecraft). Or more likely just \"weightlessness\".\n\nFemale astronauts have the option of carrying their preferred pads or tampons while in space ([Popular Science 2016](http://www.popsci.com/brief-history-menstruating-in-space)). If they choose to not get their periods they can medically induce amenorrhea, or stop their periods from happening ([The Atlantic 2016](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/04/menstruating-in-space/479229/)). There was [a scientific paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/npjmgrav20168) written on medically induced amenorrhea in female astronauts in 2016. \n\nThere are several ways to induce amenorrhea, through hormonal pills, injections or intrauterine device (IUDs). While it is safe to have your period in space, it may not be all that convenient to switch pads or tampons and deal with disposal. The water treatment is also set up to recycle water from urine, but not menstrual blood so that is also an issue ([American Chemical Society 2014](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2014/acs-presspac-april-9-2014/recycling-astronaut-urine-for-energy-and-drinking-water.html)).\n\nAccording to National Geographic (link below) if a woman spent three years in space she would need about 1,100 pills, which adds some weight to a mission but is less unwieldy than many tampons. Alternatively, three years worth of tampons (or pads) still weighs more than three years worth of pills.\n\nFemale astronauts' periods have a long history. National Geographic has a great opening paragraph in one of [their articles](http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/22/how-do-women-deal-with-having-a-period-in-space/) on the subject:\n\n&gt;Sally Ride\u2019s tampons might be the most-discussed tampons in the world. Before Ride became the first American woman in space, scientists pondered her tampons, weighed them, and NASA\u2019s professional sniffer smelled them\u2014better to take deodorized or non-deodorized?\u2014to make sure they wouldn\u2019t smell too strongly in a confined space capsule. Engineers considered exactly how many she might need for a week in space. (Is 100 the right number?, they famously asked her. No, Ride said. That is not the right number.)",

                    "comment": "The thing with NASA is that EVERYTHING is overengineered for the absolute worst case scenario on purpose since you can't just pop off to the store if you happen to run out. They probably thought \"What's the average amount of pads used per day? 3-6? Ok lets say 8 to be safe. How many days will the period last for? 2-7? Ok lets say 10 to be safe.\" That gives you 80 per week right there, plus NEVER having experience a period in space, there was no way to plan for what might happen.",

They also were uncertain of the medical issues of menstruating and whether or not the uterus would be able to expel the shed lining in zero gravity or if it were possible for the lining to move up into the fallopian tubes (retrograde menstruation) ([Popular Science 2016](http://www.popsci.com/brief-history-menstruating-in-space)).

It's a tunnel a few inches long.  It's the place where the fun happens when sexy times are going on. :)  My cervix is  around the end of this.  The cervix connects  the vagina to the uterus.  The cervix is basically a muscle ring that spends it's whole life clenched tightly.  It's job is to keep stuff--except sperm--out of the womb.\n\nThe womb is there the baby making happens.  think of it as a sack, or a balloon or something. It's got space on the inside.\n\nWhen we have a period, what's basically happening is that the inner layer of the womb is peeling off.  This inner layer has a lot of blood vessels in it, because it's supposed to be ripe delicious ground for a fertilized egg to rest.  So when it starts peeling off, there's a lot of blood and juice and stuff.\n\nSo, it's basically an open, weeping wound. Heavy days are when the bleeding is heavier.  Lighter days are when the bleeding is lighter.\n\nThere are some actions we can take that can ...  adjust the rate at which blood leaves our body, so to speak.  For example, laying down allows blood to pool, both in the womb and in the vaginal canal.  Blood flow is lessened as a result, however, when you stand up, gravity WILL kick back in.\n\n(for comedy, this can result in, in the morning, laying stone still as one feels that there is a lot of blood inside them....  then the QUICK leap up out of bed, clutching one's crotch and fleeing to bathroom.)\n\nActions that involve contracting the womb can make more blood come out--as the womb already contracts itself to try and push blood out.  excersize, activity, orgasm and similar can have the same result.\n\nBeing still can result in blood pooling inside.  Every womb-owner has experienced, say, going through a class, and feeling fine in regards to if they need to change their tampons, then standing up, and realizing that no, they need to go NOW.\n\nbut we can't really effect the heavy/light-ness of our period.  We can't control how bad the wound is bleeding, so to speak.  Typically, you start with light days, then heavy days, then light days again.\n\nso, again, think of it as a water ballon or something, attached to some flexible tubing.  the water's leaking out at a relatively set rate (that may be light, heavy or anything in between) ... and the water finds all sorts of places to go, and changing the orientation of the tubing can result in pooled fluid being released from the \"tide pools\" so to speak.",

The amount extra you're allowed is controlled, but you can't compensate very well if you have too little of pretty much anything. So you can't go absolutely crazy overboard, but it's still better to have too much than to die due to having too little. Sure, they probably won't die to too few hygiene products, but that mindset of over estimating is still there to compensate for the fact that you can't skip over to the store and get some more.\n\nThe factor of safety (either mathematically or just the basic idea) applies to everything in spacecraft design. Calculate your needs, calculate expected losses, then add some more to your estimate because you can rarely just fix something trivially.",

I wonder if NASA's 1.4 was built from a similar analysis, and they figured they could use a similar factor for almost anything since any failure in space is an emergency?",

I'm fortunate that my period lasts about 3-4 days and I don't usually need to use anything when I sleep. My experience is only one data point of menstruation on the billions of data points of total female menstruation and tampon/pad needs. 18 is likely not enough when considering the average, which I wasn't thinking about while hastily typing that last comment. I was trying to give an idea of what's needed, not a 100% this is what they'd send answer as I'm not sure what NASA actually sends.\n\nThanks for your correction! :)",

There are other ways you could probably get around it, if you carried lyophilized (essentially freeze dried powder) hormones you would probably gain some time. It could then be aliquoted, mixed with remaining stuff and converted into pills or whatever every month.\n\nMy guess though, if there's a mission of such length that expiration of pills becomes a problem, NASA will strongly advise an IUD.",

They set the dates by testing thier potency after they age that long. \n\nThe point of the NPR/Propublica article wasn't that drugs can still be viable after their expiration date - I think that is fairly common knowledge. \n\nThe point was that the FDA hasn't passed down its knowledge to industry and that by not doing so, it's potentially costing the healthcare system billions of dollars.  The federal government routinely instructs the FDA to test the US strategic stockpiles of drugs after they expire.  From this testing, they have learned a lot about drug potency over time and routinely extend the shelf life of these drugs that they stockpile themselves.  That knowledge hasn't been applied to drugs that are kept in pharmacies for consumer use causing the destruction of perfectly good drugs every year. \n\n\n",

The expirations are entirely based off of research and testing up to a certain point, and then anything after that point is considered expired.\n\nThe Department of Defense was particularly interested in this and in conjunction with the FDA, they found that \"[...12 of the 14, or 86%, of the compounds tested in the drugs retained at least 90% of their potency 28 to 40 years after their expiration dates.](http://www.usmedicine.com/agencies/department-of-defense-dod/dodfda-program-seeks-to-extend-lives-of-expired-medications/)\" There's a program, as referenced in that article, that the DoD uses to lower costs and to keep healthy supply of strategically important medications called SLEP, where they allow drugs to be dispensed past their manufacturer's expiration date.\n\nOf course, that doesn't necessarily mean everyone should start taking their expired medications instead of getting a new prescription/OTC bottle.  These were stored under extremely controlled conditions (much like what NASA would presumably do), in unopened packaging.  \n\nA lot of drugs, once open the environment, do start to deteriorate and lose their effectiveness over time, and the fact that we just do not have any testing beyond the manufacturer's expiration date on an opened bottle makes it very unwise to take them.  There's a reported case of someone developing Fanconi Syndrome from taking [expired Doxycycline](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/664082) for instance (stored in very poor conditions).\n",

Essentially, a woman's body replenishes the bone density lost during 2 year of Depo use if given ~6 months of non-use, without the need for supplements or adjusted diet. \n\nI wonder if the bone density recovery from Depo would counteract any of the density loss from microgravity, if timed right.

The gravity/gravitational field strength (due to Earth) on the ISS is about 0.88 times that on the surface. On the border of space (100km up) it would be 0.97 times surface gravity. To get down to half gravity you'd have to travel over 2,600km up. At the Moon's average height, Earth's gravity is 1.6% surface gravity [if my maths is correct].\n\nA better term would be \"weightlessness\". There is still the force of gravity acting on them, and still acceleration due to gravity, but no \"g-force\" - defined as the total acceleration causing a perception of weight (a somewhat circular definition). So based off reaction/surface forces - anything but gravity (and some e-m forces).\n\n\"Zero gravity\" is incorrect in this situation. \"Zero-g\" or \"Zero-g-force\" would be accurate - but still a bit confusing. While the \"g\" in \"zero-g\" or \"g-force\" refers to gravity, it is neither a force, nor caused by gravity. The *g* is more a symbol to denote the gravitational field strength or acceleration due to the Earth's gravity on its surface (9.81... m/s/s) - so a \"base unit\" for measuring reaction accelerations.",

            "comment": "Addendum: Now that I am at my computer, I can source/edit the post for those interested.\n\nThe three predominant modalities previously used were depot medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera), danazol, or oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) in suppression-dosing fashion (RT Jennings &amp; ES Baker's chapter from Principles of Clinical Medicine for Space Flight by Barratt 1st Ed 2008). Suppression dosing means that they would skip the placebo week and restart a new pack every three weeks to cause amenorrhea. The most common choice was OCPs which would make since given the more abnormal bleeding patterns we may see initially with Depo and the fear of bone mineral density effects that both space and Depo could play (Knunitz 2009). Though it must be noted, that OCPs were not without risk either. Depot medroxyprogesterone is a progesterone-only contaceptive; the most common OCPs contain estrogen and progesterone. Exogenous estrogen may increase the risk for venous thromboembolism given female astronauts now meet Virchow's Triad of hypercoaguability caused by the estrogen, stasis in space, and trauma that occurs. Dr. Varsha Jain at Kings College London is an expert on this and has a freely-available lecture online [here](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20150001648.pdf). \n\nAs others have mentioned, the ISS can recycle urine, but not blood and thus not having any bleeding was strongly desired. If women were done with childbearing, they sometimes would perform an endometrial ablation to prevent bleeding. This was preferred over a hysterectomy because they would prefer not to create adhesions in the abdomen and put astronauts at risk for bowel obstruction etc while in space. This is again discussed in the chapter by Jennings linked above. Currently, Mirena IUDs are preferred. This is more appropriate modality in that it can cause amenorrhea, decrease risk of endometrial cancer, act as highly-effective birth control, and decrease the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) by not giving exogenous estrogen.",

As for radiation, both men and women in the Corps are advised to avoid pregnancy for up to one year after living aboard the Space Station, in part, due to radiation, but also due to the physiological changes that occur in the microgravity environment",

Astronauts can be returned to Earth in less than a day. Appendicitis on a submarine is probably a much bigger deal than on the space station. \n\n&gt; have any female astronauts gone on to have kids?\n\nYes. Off the top of my head I know that Eileen Collins (first woman to command a shuttle mission) did. She's certainly not the only one. ",

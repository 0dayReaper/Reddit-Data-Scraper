    "postText": "I distinctly remember in Middle School Biology class, when we were learning about protists, the textbook said the following \"These unicellular organisms use cilia and flagella to get around because at their size, the water has the consistency of maple syrup. Fins like fish have wouldn't work for them.\"\n\nBut like if we extended this, that would mean that at larger and larger scales, water has less apparent viscosity. Does that mean a minnow feels water as being thicker than I do? A whale feels water as being thinner than I do? But they both have similar structures for locomotion. If I were 600 feet tall, would swimming in honey feel the same as me being 6 feet tall swimming in water?\n\nThere's just a lot of consequences to this statement that start to pop up if it is in fact true.",

            "comment": "The concept you are working towards is what we call the Reynolds number, which is a ratio of inertial effects to viscous effects. A paramecium in water has essentially no inertia due to its microscopic size, while when we swim we have a very significant amount of inertia, much more so than viscous drag. This has a huge effect on how the organism can effectively move through water. A great paper/essay explaining how this specially affects organisms of different sizes is called [Life at Low Reynolds Number](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/gold/pdfs/purcell.pdf) by Nobel Laureate E. M. Purcell.",

                    "comment": "I don't think the Reynolds number is the right measure in this case, but rather the Stokes number. The Reynolds number describes the motion of the fluid itself and how inertial and viscous forces interact for the flow of the fluid, while the Stokes number applies to the ratio of inertial to viscous forces acting on a particle or other body immersed in a fluid.\n\nIf a whale stops actively swimming, it will keep moving for a long time because the interim of the whale itself dominates over the viscous forces on the whale from the water, not because of any inertia the water itself has, and likewise the reverse for a paramecium.",

                            "comment": "No, Stokes number is for particles being swept along passively the flow.  While bulk flow will obviously move smaller organisms more easily, what's actually interesting about these creatures is active locomotion, including through still water.  Nobody actually studying them uses Stokes number; it's always Reynolds number.",

Here is a study on rats: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6668114/\n\nyou can see a lot more if you google \"hemisphere specialization in animals\"\n\nYou should also know that this specialization is a convenient arrangement, not a hard rule. If one half the brain is damaged, the other can learn to do all the tasks.",

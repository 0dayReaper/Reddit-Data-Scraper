            "comment": "If we don't restrict ourselves to the surface of the Earth, non-Newtonian fluids are not at all rare because it is broadly indicated through a variety of lines of evidence that substantial portions of at least the upper mantle are best described as a non-Newtonian fluid (e.g., [Post &amp; Griggs, 1973](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.181.4106.1242), [Zhong &amp; Gurnis, 1996](https://www.nature.com/articles/383245a0), [van den Berg &amp; Yuen, 1996](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/96GL02065), [Giunchi &amp; Spada, 2000](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2000GL011460), [Billen &amp; Hirth, 2005](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005GL023457), [Jadamec &amp; Billen, 2010](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature09053), [Semple &amp; Lenadric, 2020](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/224/2/961/5928551)) albeit a fluid with a *very high* viscosity (i.e., something in the range 10^(17) to 10^(20) Pa s). There's also been the suggestion that earlier in Earth's history, much more of the mantle actually behaved as a non-Newtonian fluid (e.g., [van den Berg et al., 1995](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012821X9400246U)), whereas today it's generally thought that the lower mantle is better described as a Newtonian fluid. \n\nAt surface conditions, but staying with geologic materials, many parts of lava flows are also best described as non-Newtonian fluids (e.g., [Pinkerton &amp; Sparks, 1978](https://www.nature.com/articles/276383a0), [Griffiths, 2000](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.fluid.32.1.477), [Lavalle\u0301e et al., 2007](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article/35/9/843/129997/Non-Newtonian-rheological-law-for-highly)), but not all lava flows (and not all parts of individual flows) are non-Newtonian and the rheology of lava is pretty complicated and spans a suite of behaviors including brittle, plastic, and viscous (both linear and non-linear).\n\nMore broadly, I think this quote from [Balmforth &amp; Craster, 2001](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45670-8_2) is quite relevant, \"The main motivation for this research activity is that, apart from some annoyingly common fluids such as air and water, virtually no fluid is actually Newtonian (that is, having a simple linear relation between stress and strain-rate characterized by a constant viscosity).\" In short, a lot of fluids are non-Newtonian (if only slightly), but I'll leave further discussion to folks who are likely more versed in fluid dynamics than I.",

The real question is how well does the Newtonian model fit reality. That varies depending on what you're doing. There are no real Newtonian fluids.\n\n\"All models are false. Some models are useful.\"",

Many biological fluids are non-Newtonian (blood, saliva, mucus, seamen, milk, etc etc) as well as other non-biological fluids such as lava, quicksand, slush, river beds, tree sap. The list is really very long.",

Ketchup and toothpaste are plastic fluids, which won't flow until you push them out.",

Fluids are likely to be well approximated by the Newtonian model if they have small molecules, so that includes gasses and non-polymeric liquids. Any material that has long range order (consistent arrangements beyond the scale of the single molecule) will demonstrate complex rheology.",

Usually even big boulders would float on the mix. They are fairly common in mountain ranges in tropical areas, where it rains a lot and rocks are more susceptible to weathering.\n\nEdit: I believe avalanches in mountain ranges in non-tropical areas might behave as a non-Newtonian fluid as well.",

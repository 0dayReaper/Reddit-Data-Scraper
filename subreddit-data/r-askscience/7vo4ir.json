Together, the two fields are stronger than the original and lie essentially along the axis of the Earth's rotation.\"",

You're trying to analyze only one part, but it's a loop from a very complex entanglement of magnetic fields. This is hard to recreate in a lab, but can be done with molten sodium, for example. Anything with a lot of energy can cause charged particles. There is a lot of heat and friction, so this is expected. Since each charge has its own electric field, and it's all moving from thermal activity, a moving charge generates a magnetic field. There's your weak magnetic field. Now the feedback occurs from its self sustaining nature.\n\nHopefully that makes sense.",

Try to carefully flip it over and carefully unplug it after settling to let the water out without imparting any angular momentum bias. By the time it's empty, the water will usually be swirling in one direction. Unless you introduce a bias, you are likely to find that the direction it ends up swirling varies. Miniscule initial fluctions cause a self-reinforcing pattern to emerge.",

From there, if you have a large amount of conductive material moving relative to this magnetic field generated by the relative motion of charged ions, you get an electric field that then induces a current flow in the conductive material, which in turn creates it's own magnetic field. The more conductive material, and the faster the relative motion, the greater the current and voltage you get, and hence the greater the magnetic field you get.\n\nSo in summary, I imagine there would have to be some initial free ions in motion to create the initial weak magnetic field.",

You probably know Venus as the rocky planet with the thick atmosphere. You may also know that we believe that thick atmosphere is caused by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity can only come about due to liquid planetary cores, like on Earth.\n\nWell, you may also know that Mars has a thin atmosphere due to not having a magnetic field--essentially all the radiation hitting it from the sun strips away over time. Conversely, the Earth has its own atmosphere thanks to its magnetic field. Naturally, we can assume that any planet that has an atmosphere needs a magnetic field to protect it, right? So, how strong must Venus's magnetic field be to protect all that atmosphere?\n\nThe answer is Venus doesn't have one. For all intents and purposes, Venus's magnetosphere is as nonexistent as Mars's. The only way we can reasonably assume that to be true is if Venus's core is no longer liquid. But the only way for it to have it's trademarked atmosphere, then is to be *really* volcanically active, which can only be true if it has some sort of liquid core. If it has any sort of liquid core, however, we should see *some* sort of magnetic field--even if it is extremely weak.\n\nBasically, if there is an exception to a rule for the inner planets, its Venus (it also rotates about its axis backwards for even more planetary shenanigans).",

This shear layer induces backwards spin on Venus.\n\n\nVenus collects enough matter to have molten core and atmosphere and liquid water.\n\n\nEventually the backwards spin is slowed by the direction of orbiting the sun.\n\n\nCore solidifies and loses magnetosphere. Now the atmosphere starts to lose the outer protective layers.\n\n\nSolar radiation is enough to penetrate to the surface and evaporate the oceans and trapped CO2 left from volcanically active period.\n\n\nNow we have runaway greenhouse effect that further heats the surface and any trapped gas and water near the surface. (This is where the atmospheric conditions are now?)\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the speed of the atmosphere and the composition is enough that it generates its own magnetosphere. Though extremely weak it is enough to prevent the atmosphere from being stolen away by the solar radiation and solar wind.\n\n\n",

This one I lumped together because it essentially requires us to be living at \"the exact right time\" which should give a lot of pause in scientific discussions. \n\nThe other theory is that Venus's seismology is radically different from Earth's, which I'd lean to saying is \"more correct\". The only way to really KNOW if it is would be to send landers to Venus and look around basically, which is a significant engineering challenge (its surface temperature being able to melt lead, and under intense pressure after all). \n\nHowever, that sort of thing is exactly the sort of challenge we SHOULD be accepting when it comes to planets. Solving it could lead to breakthroughs not just here on Earth and for future colonization efforts, but also in being able to probe the upper atmospheres of Gas Giants (and really, someday I hope to see a photograph of the [liquid metallic hydrogen oceans](https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/09aug_juno3) inside Jupiter, though if it happens it'll probably be well past anyone alive today's lifetimes).",

Magnets we have made ourselves work a little different. \n\nTo simplify the way our magnets work you can say that each atom in the iron has a direction of it\u2019s magnetic field. In a regular piece of iron the direction of the magnetic field is different for every atom, hence the different magnetic fields will cancel out each other and the iron will not be magnetic. However if you bring a magnet close to the iron it\u2019s atoms will turn the same way as the magnetic field and become magnetic. \n\nTo make a permanent magnet of iron, you heat up the iron while it is affected by a magnetic field from another magnet. You keep the magnet in this magnetic field while it cools down. This will make all the atoms of the iron to point its magnetic field in the same direction permanently, hence creating a permanent magnet.\n",

Electrons have an innate magnetic field due to \"spin\" (a QM property that has effects a bit like if each electron were actually a tiny spinning charged sphere, hence the name). Normally, electrons bound to atoms tend to \"pair up\" so that their spins cancel, and any unpaired electrons have randomly-oriented spin, so there's no bulk magnetism.\n\nMaterials like iron have two things: they have some unpaired electrons in their shells, and they have long-range delocalized bonds that cause the bond electrons to line up in the same direction as each other (instead of antiparallel). Unmagnetized iron actually has a large number of microscopic, fully-magnetized \"domains\", but they're randomly oriented. In magnetized iron they're somewhat aligned. And the domains, being (much) larger than a single electron, are more stable against getting re-randomized by thermal perturbations. Unless you get them hot enough \u2014 which brings us back to the thread title.",

We've never successfully reached a point where we could directly sample any of the material of the Earth's mantle. The [deepest we've ever drilled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole) into the Earth is about 12 km.  On the continents, the Earth's crust is about 30 km deep, and the Earth itself is 6,400 km across.  The deepest we've ever been is 0.2% of the depth of the Earth.  If the Earth were a chicken egg, that would be less than halfway through the shell.\n\nAFAIK, virtually everything we know about the composition of the Earth below the crust comes from our study of earthquakes and how their energy propagates through the planet and not just across the crust. Most everything else comes from knowledge of the composition of meteorites.\n",

As you heat the metal, the field \"melts\" and becomes misaligned.  \n\nThe magnetic field generated by the core is due to the material being in motion. Electric and magnetic fields are generated by charged particles in motion. A classic example of this is an electromagnet where you coil conductive wire and run electricity through it to generate a magnet (electricity is just electrons, charged particles, in motion). The liquid iron at the core of earth has sufficient charge that it acts in a similar manner, and generates a magnetic field. If the earth's core would cool fairly quickly, and we had an external magnetic field that was strong enough - the earth could become a permanent magnet as well.",

The dynamo is what maintains the earth's magnetic field over geological time scales, and it requires a conducting fluid that is both rotating (spin of the earth) and convecting (heat from the inner core) to generate the feedback loop that maintains the field.\n\nHowever, something that may not have been clear in my and others' answers is that a dynamo needs a \"seed\" field to get it going. If you created a shielded dynamo in a place with zero fields, it would not spontaneously generate a magnetic field. From my looking there doesn't seem to be an agreed upon \"seed\" for the earth's dynamo yet, but wikipedia mentions the magnetic field carried by the solar wind (which was much stronger during an earlier phase in the sun's lifetime) and currents in the core-mantle boundary driven by chemical reactions or variations in thermal or electric conductivity. Once these produced a field in the dynamo, the feedback loop would have taken over to amplify and maintain it against dissipation.",

            "comment": "So magnetism is a bit weird in general. Electricity and magnetism are part of the same basic force, electromagnetism, and they're both caused by the movement of electrons.\n\nMagnetism, in particular, arises as a consequence  of electron motion. Moving electrical charges generate a magnetic field. \n\nThere's two very basic types of magnet then: permanent magnets and electromagnets. Permanent magnets are likely what you're thinking of when you talk about iron losing its magnetism. They're the result of an imbalance in electron spins throughout a material, resulting in a net motion that's moves in one direction. This net motion creates a magnetic field, and can be lost because heat disturbs the crystal structure of the material, allowing them to reorient and balance out the spins. However, at the pressures of the solid iron core, it takes much more heat to disturb the structure, meaning the core itself can remain magnetic at much higher temperatures--though this field should be fairly weak.\n\nElectromagnets result from moving the electrons through a material in a certain pattern to induce a magnetic field. This works in reverse too, as moving a magnet through a coiled conductor can also generate an electrical current. In the core of the earth, you've got a strange setup for this: instead of moving the electrons through the conductor, you're moving the conductor itself (the molten iron) around the magnetic solid core. This electrical \"current\" around the magnet essentially acts like an amplifier for the magnetic field. It's something of a combination of an electromagnet and a permanent magnet. At least from my understanding.",

Sure, termal motion of electrons will create magnetic fields on microscopic scale but due to the motion being chaotic, those fields will be distributed isotropically (and I'm using that word here not in fully conventional way) and cancel out, so there will be no *macroscopic* field. In order to have considerable macroscopic field you need an ordered drift, and termal motion is not one.\n\nYou might want to consider following questions:\n\n1. Even without superheating, electrons constantly move \"inside\" the atoms, which should also produce the magnetic field. Why, then, everything around us is not magnetic?\n\n2. As you may (or may not) know, there's such thing as Curie point: when you heat a magnet (even a very strong one), upon reaching certain temperature magnetic properties are suddenly lost, and even cooling the resulting un-magnetized lump of metal down will not turn it back into a magnet. How does it prove (or disprove) your claim?\n\nTake this as coming from postgraduate physicist specialized in the non-quantum electromagnetic processes.\n\nAlso, keep me excused on incorrect wording (if it's there) and crappy use of the articles (which is surely there) - English is neither my first language, nor second one.\n\nEDIT: formatting\n\nEDIT2: added a quote to make the context more clear",

Potentially conclude that the tension on the molten materials around the core causes them to spin around the core and effectively turn it into one massive electromagnet.\n\nAnd with respect to the cores spin, much like the Sun it would have a wobble to it, which very slowly over time would cause the poles to shift. What we call declination, showing the current orientation of the core.\n\nMuch like the Suns Core wobbles, but not nearly as apparent or obvious without significant time for observation.\n\nAlso, when you superheat a magnet, all you are doing is destabilizing it's molecular alignment. When it cools, the molecules simply settle in a pattern befitting their environment. Generally speaking, a non-magnetic one, or one with very low magnetism. An electromagnet functions by aligning the electron charge of the metal to a polar one, while a magnet functions by effectively aligning the molecules in such a way that it achieves the same effect without electricity being used.",

            "comment": "Most of the replies have focused on the motion of the liquid outer core around the solid inner core, which is the primary driver of the geodynamo (there's other, more exotic dynamos for things like gas giants that might depend on metal-liquid hydrogen and slushy methane mixtures). But for the inner core, many of the comments haven't addressed the original question - why does the iron not lose it's ferromagnetic properties?\n\nThe answer is that the super crazy high pressures drive phase changes in the solid iron that allow it to maintain an inherent magnetic field, although not with the same properties (note: this also depends on stuff like nickel mixed in with the iron). Iron at 335 GPa is not the same structure as ambient pressure iron, and the electronic properties get all sorts of weird. Same goes for the liquid iron of the outer core - it is still electrically conducting (the convective flow of which drives the dynamo), but the spin state of the iron changes. There's also some anisotropy in the Earth's magnetic field that may be related to the crystallization properties of the iron at the liquid-solid outer-inner interface in the core.\n\nSource: [quantum mechanics of the Earth's core](https://phys.org/news/2017-07-quantum-mechanics-earth-core.html)\n",

            "comment": "Actually, that was a pretty good question.\n\nMagnetism is apparently an emergent effect from a large number of charged particles sharing an alignment.  Think of that famous video of simple harmonic motion taking down the bridge in Washington.  (Tacoma Narrows, I believe.)\n\nWell, a small thing can be aligned on the scale of, well, a small thing.  But eventually other factors can be so energetic they disrupt any small form similarity.  That's your Curie limit.\n\nHowever, things that are dissimilar at one scale can be highly similar at another.  Over distances where the temperature driven effects completely average out to nothing, there can be much larger similarities.  From those larger features (think a raindrop vs a state in a hurricane) you can derive the same similarities that gave you locally magnetic behavior, only of course now on a much more vast scale.\n\nHuh!",

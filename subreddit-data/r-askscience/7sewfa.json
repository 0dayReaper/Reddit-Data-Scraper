These fish have managed to preserve eyesight even at the greatest depths, although they see only in black and white.\"\n\nAlso the golomyanka (oil fish) \"can endure most pressure in the depths of the Baikal water. At night it rises to the water surface, and at daytime it swims down to great depths. Limnologists have had a chance to observe the golomynka's behaviour in the water depths. At a depth of 1,000-1,400 metres and more, the golomyanka moves freely both horizontally and vertically, whereas at such a depth even a cannon cannot shoot because of the enormous pressure.\"",

I don't think squirrels are objectively cute, but they do share a lot of features with cats and horses (at least compared to stuff that lives in a zero light environment).  Additionally, we are taught to be accepting, but blind humans wear dark glasses because other humans find their eyes a little bit startling, not because they're trying to keep the sun out.  There's something that I think instinctively alarms us about a life form that doesn't share an identical set of senses, though I don't have the slightest idea of why that would be... maybe... I dunno, instinctual disease avoidance?  Sicknesses that alter appearance would certainly be a good thing to avoid, so maybe there's a \"health is wrong\" alarm built into us?

Since they have no way of knowing how bright it is, nor can their eyes adjust to incoming UV radiation to protect the inner eyes, they wear them to prevent damage to their eyes that could still have painful side effects. When damage is done to your eyes in that manner, your eyes still get irritated and possibly inflamed. Although they aren't able to use them normally by receivi g ocular input, they are still a functional organ, so they still have pain receptors. Since they can't tell what their eyes are facing (i.e. the sun or other high output light sources), they wear them to prevent possible accidental damage (and pain) to their eyes",

Free divers endure compression of their lungs and sinuses on descent (and expansion to original volume while ascending) while scuba divers who can't control their ascent rate can be killed by expanding the gas pockets in their bodies to many times their original volume.\n\nHowever, this fish - or an ordinary ziplock bag full of nothing but water - has no problems changing depth because it contains no pockets of air that need to be reinforced and protected against crushing.",

There are sitting drops, hanging drops, solvent-enclosed drops, and a few other methods for this.\n\nYou can also salt in...most proteins require some assortment of ions to be present in a solution in suitable concentrations to become soluble.  If you start a solution of proteins at a low concentration, and then dialyze out those salts, the protein will become less soluble and crystalize.",

Evolution doesn't have a concept of boundaries, it doesn't know that maybe it might be a good idea to build proteins that can retain their functions in a range of different conditions. Evolution only has the ability to create proteins that survive in the range of conditions an organism is typically exposed to.\n\nAnd quite often the result of that process are proteins which *do not* function well in conditions that affect protein folding such as differences in temperature, salinity, pH, and pressure. If organisms did evolve under those conditions, and some have, then their proteins would be fine. But on the flip side, sometimes those creatures can't survive at lower pressures, because the protein folding conditions are too different and their proteins haven't been selected to survive such changes.",

If the ambient pressure around the cannon is greatly increased such that the pressure behind the ball upon firing is still less than the ambient pressure, the cannonball will not move, barring structural failure of the cannon itself. I guess if the cannon were submerged and allowed to equilibrate, then this wouldn't be a problem, but idk. You're right though, that's a weird analogy to use and I don't think it's appropriate here.",

A black powder cannon might be around 25,000 psi or so, vs water pressure around 2,400 psi at a depth of 1642 meters.  The thing is by the time the projectile has reached the end of the barrel the pressure will be considerably lower.  I doubt anyone has tested this out but I could see the projectile never leaving the barrel of the gun.  You also have to consider that because the barrel will be filled with water it will absorb a considerable amount of energy from the projectile.  You're not just firing a cannonball out of the gun, you're firing a cannonball plus 10 gallons of water or whatever it is.",

The higher the ambient pressure, the denser the gas would be when fully expanded, so I guess there's some pressure where a certain mass of hot gas just wouldn't be able to take up enough volume to fill the cannon barrel and push the ball out.",

In fact you wouldn't even feel the water pressure for the same reasons that you can't feel the weight of the atmosphere: Water pressure is omnidirectional.  If you tried swimming at 1600 m depth you would need to lift 160 atmospheres worth of pressure every time you try to move your limbs up - but that pressure would be canceled out by 160 atmospheres worth of pressure pushing your limbs *upwards*. Incidentally your body would be unharmed in the process since it itself is mostly water which is pretty much incompressible. \n\nOf course some parts of your body are filled with (very much compressible) gas, but that's where the equipment comes in.\n\nSpecifically you would need a massive gas tank which is under much higher pressure then the environment to ensure that the air you're breathing is at the same pressure as the surroundings. (A normal scuba diving tank would work in theory, but it would afford you less than half a lung full of air before being \"empty\"). \n\nAlso, gas composition would be a problem. Oxygen becomes toxic under high pressures. But this can be compensated for by using gas mixtures that contain less oxygen than air. According to my quick back-of-the-envelop calculation, at a 1600 m depth you would want the gas in your tank to be more than 99.5% Helium and less than 0.5% Oxygen. \n\nAll of this is assuming that you start at 1600 m of course. Things get a lot more complicated if you are planning to move down 1600 m outside of a submarine. \n\nAnd this is what makes some deep sea animal like the fish described here really impressive: It's not their ability to deal with the pressure at 1600 m, but the ability to deal with the *change of pressure* between 1600 m and the surface. \n\n",

Evolution has been able to have its heyday down there, which has led to a diverse assemblage of fishes, crustaceans, cephalopods, and other invertebrates.\n\nOn top of this, there are only two freshwater lakes on earth that are over 1000 m deep, Baikal and Tanganyika. The latter is about ten million years old, the former perhaps 30 million years old. Compared to the age of the ocean, that is a tiny fraction of time. They have also been isolated from other water bodies due to topography, so there aren't many immigrants that can later evolve into new species.\n\nIn addition, Tanganyika has spent a significant proportion of its history as a much shallower lake than this (it was actually multiple lakes, which is [reflected in the diversity of cichlid fish there](http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/7087/Mitochondrial_Phylogeography_of_Rock_Dwelling_1996.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y)). So the abyssal zone in Tanganyika is relatively young and unstable.\n\nBaikal is older and larger and the abyssal zone was more stable (including never scoured by ice like most similar lakes), but it is still in a cold climate (less biodiversity to begin with) and isolated from other bodies of water. Because of the depth of ice coverage, the entire Baikal ecosystem has occasionally [collapsed](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018204001099), effectively re-starting the evolutionary race.\n\nSo the two lakes on earth that are deep enough to be completely devoid of light just haven't had the evolutionary chances of the ocean.",

If it\u2019s a foot of water aimed directly perpendicular to the ground, then the mountains matter a lot. \n\nThink about one of these (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FPHLFRE/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_awdb_t1_YyaAAbWPDNY3C). The same number of pins covers the same amount of space regardless of the elevation. But only if the pins are all going in the same direction. If the requirement was perpindicular coverage, obviously you\u2019d need more pins to stick out to the side of your finger or hand. ",

It also makes you *really* keenly aware of the sound quality of the ambient air, since listening to what direction it's coming from is just about the only way to orient yourself.",

At Milford Sound in New Zealand there's a dark layer of fresh water sitting on top of the salt water beneath (due to the tannins from run off from forests) which artificially cuts off a lot of light to the clear salt water below. It means that a lot of deep sea creatures come up and live in shallower waters than they would normally, in the strike zone of recreational diving. ",

As with most substances, the ocean water will have a \"half-distance\" thickness that will block or scatter half the light.  If the half-distance is 100 meters, the light will have been halved 10 times (a factor of 1024) by the time it reaches 1000m.  At 2000m, light is down to 1/~1,000,000 surface brightness. Etc.\n\nThe transparency of lake water will vary throughout the year as silt, algae, etc. concentrations change.  Deep lakes certainly will have a near-black zone for at least part of the year. ",

It's like, the ocean is just one ocean, there's stuff you only find in certain parts, but theoretically anything can get to anywhere.  Lakes are like... isolated little communities.  There could be some bizarre creature that's only in one lake and evolved separately over a million years.  That kind of freaks me out a little to think about.",

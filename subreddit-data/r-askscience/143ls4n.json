Back in the cold war, fallout shelters contained normal iodine pills you were supposed to take regularly, just to use le Chatelier's principle of having so much normal iodine in your system you kept the radioactive stuff from collecting.\n\nSkin cancer's a very real thing, since it gets exposed first.\n\nAnd then there's leukemia.  I think it's got to do with how fragile bone marrow cells are and how quickly they reproduce and thus respond to radiation.  Similar thing for lymphoma.",

I don't know the answer.\n\nMy suspicion is no, because there wouldn't be any specific mutation that could be caused by ionizing radiation that couldn't becaused by some other chemical reaction.\n\nNow there's going to be a discrepancy on that likelihood of that.  Skin cancer is caused by a specific dimerization of thymine, caused by radiation.  UV is slightly less energetic than ionizing radiation, so maybe you want to rule that out.  There are other means to cause the same mutation, but I'd guess 99% of the time it's going to be caused by UV.",

UV range is 3 eV to 124 eV.  \n\nHydrogen ionizes at 13.6 eV, and most other atoms/molecules ionize below that.  So, most of the UV range \\*is\\* ionizing.  \n\nThat said, I 've often read the statement that UV is not considered to be ionizing radiation, which is strange to me.",

Almost every cell type and tissue can develop cancer, and the cell that makes it big and becomes a successful cancer cell free from the unnecessary regulation of the body and capable of infinite growth doesn't much care what caused the DNA break that led to its success.\n\nSome cancers are more commonly associated w/ radiation because of proximity, like skin cancer, thyroid cancer as explained here, bone cancer (bones like delicious strontium, they just incorporate it freely) etc.",

There are some hypothesized mechanisms involving oxidative stress but so far there is no good evidence for it. Studies on radiowaves and cancer have shown results ranging from a protective effect to a deleterious effect which is generally what happens when two things are unrelated and when studies are lower quality. Then there is an inherent bias for publishing only significant results as well as news stories reporting on deleterious effects (i.e. a story about power lines possibly causing cancer gets more clicks than one about power lines doing nothing).",

Electromagnetic radiation, like gamma rays or X rays, can pass through your body  destroying DNA as they come in contact with it on their way through.\n\nBut there *are* certain cancers associated with radiation exposure, and it comes down to the radioactive isotopes. If radioactive isotopes get into your body, they\u2019re going to be more concentrated in the area of the body where that chemical element is important for body function and structure. And since they\u2019re more concentrated near/in certain organs, that organ is subject to more ionizing radiation than other organs and more at risk for cancer. \n\nFor example, radioactive iodine exposure is associated with thyroid cancer because the thyroid needs a lot of iodine, radioactive strontium exposure is associated with leukemia and bone cancers because strontium tends to concentrate in bones (thus also near bone marrow, hence leukemia), etc.",

            "comment": "Short answer: no. \nLonger answer\nThere is some debate about whether risk increases linearly with exposure (Linear no threshold model,  usually used for safety decisions), or if there is a threshold value which the cells can deal with. \nOne problem is that we are continously bathed in ionizing radiation from the sun, cosmic rays, natural and man made isotopes etc.  In theory at least,  you could be hit by a single billion year old high energy photon which could cause cancer in the cell it hits. This, combined with other ways cancer can occur without radiation,  makes it extremely difficult to pinpoint exactly what caused a specific cancer. \n\nThough we do know that e.g. massive doses of radiation are likely to cause tumours in susceptible tissue, if someone had multiple episodes e.g. ***lots*** of abdominal CTs we wouldn't know which one was responsible.",

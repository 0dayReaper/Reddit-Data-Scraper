    "postText": "I\u2019m not just talking about size- like their actual physiology and nutrients on a cellular level. (Apologies in advance if none of what I\u2019m about to say makes sense, I know very very little about biology lol, i\u2019m just trying to learn more :)\n\nSo say you have two tiger cubs. Both the same size. You feed them each the same quantity of meat every day (progressively they both get more as they grow etc.) You feed them cows. But one gets 6 KG worth of Runt cow meat, and one gets 6 KG worth of cow meat from ONLY the biggest cows in the herd (but both the runt and big cow are the same age!) Is there an actual different between the quality of meat? And will one tiger grow up to be stronger/healthier because of the meat\u2019s quality?\n\nAgain, maybe something in this example doesn\u2019t make sense, sorry about that. \nAn example with humans is that someone eats 0.1 kg of bananas that are small, and someone else eats 0.1 kg of bananas that are gigantic. But both bananas came from the same place and were the same age.\n\nAnd continuing on that, what about an animal with a genetic deformity? If you eat a cow that was born with brain damage, but you only eat the thighs, is there still a noticeable difference? Or how about a cow with muscular dystrophy? Or a cow with some sort of nervous system disorder? Not like a disease, just a defect.",

            "comment": "I think the fruit question and the animal question have different answers. Like the comment says the smaller fruit, especially if it's a smaller variety of banana. If the banana is grown for large size, other qualities like taste and nutrients may suffer. A smaller variety may have better taste, and possibly nutrients.\n\nFor a runt animal, since it is the smallest of the group, may have a lower than average nutrient content due to the lack of ability to access resources. (Apparently runt doesn't just mean 'small' it usually has other issues causing it to be so small)",

            "comment": "*Macro-nutrients* are the ones you see written on the side of your nutrition label.  Protein, carbohydrates, fats, etc.  These are the most important nutrients in the food you eat.\n\nDoesn't change between individual animals much.  There is natural variation between one apple and the next, but the difference is tiny comparing apples versus orange.\n\nWhen you see a food nutrition label, we don't tell you but food producers are allowed a 20% error on the label.  That is because food does naturally vary up and down in concentration and it isn't practical or useful to have a smaller error.  Who cares if your soda drink sugar content is off by a little bit when you are already going to eat an apple of unknown weight or sugar content.\n\n*Micro-nutrients* are the things like vitamins, minerals, etc., that are not typically written on the nutrient label.\n\nDoesn't really change between individual animals.  You need a certain level to live and anything more than that your body tends to excrete as waste.\n\nYour leg meat has roughly the same nutrient profile as the person next to you.\n\n&gt; what about an animal with a genetic deformity?\n\nExtreme example!  A human can be iron deficient or iron-rich.  Let's say an anemic vegan woman versus a fit high-intensity-exercise male with genes for *hemochromatosis* (inability to remove iron from dead blood cells from your blood vessels, resulting in little crystals of iron rust building up in your veins).  The first person can easily have haemoglobin blood levels &lt;30 g/L and the second &gt;160 g/L - a huge difference.  But that is for the blood and doesn't really translate into muscle.\n\n[Natural variation of iron in beef](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583546/) from same place on different cows is small.  Low-iron beef meat has ~46 mg micrograms/gram; high-iron beef has about 60 micrograms/gram.\n\nEating the lowest iron beef would require eating about 20% more by weight of food.  \n\nThat's... not really a big deal in the grand scheme of things.  Your superfood source is probably getting a lot pooped out without being used.  The sub-par food eater will be digesting a greater percentage.",

            "comment": "I don't think that's likely.  You'd probably have a different proportion of bone and organs relative to meat, just because of how scaling works, but the composition of the parts themselves should be the same.   With fruits you'd probably get more nutrients if you eat smaller ones.  Big fruits are often a bit \"diluted\" compared to small ones, since a big plant cell with a big vacuole full of water won't necessarily have more \"stuff\" in it than a smaller cell with a smaller vacuole.",

Not selected for highest protein, or best nutrition.\nFruit and veggies are grown for the tastiest and sweetest, not the most nutrition. \nLess popular fruit often has better nutrition. I am suggesting to some degree the same could apply to a runt.\nNot an expert.",

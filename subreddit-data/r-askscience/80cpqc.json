            "comment": "As several people have pointed out, the question is not [\"what is Jupiter's structure\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/80cpqc/when_did_scientists_realize_that_jupiter_had_no/duunoak/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=askscience) or [\"When did scientists realize that Jupiter had an atmosphere\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/80cpqc/when_did_scientists_realize_that_jupiter_had_no/duupzwm/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=askscience), it's \"when did scientists realize it had no solid ground?\".  It's about the *history* of knowledge of the interior composition.  Since, [recent spacecraft results](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/80cpqc/when_did_scientists_realize_that_jupiter_had_no/duuorz9/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=askscience) suggest it may gradually transition into something like a small solid core, let's interpret the question as, \"When did we first realize that Jupiter wasn't a rocky planet\"?\n\nTo solve this problem, you need to calculate the mass of Jupiter and its size, so you can find its *density*.  The mass of Jupiter can be calculated using Newtonian orbital mechanics, provided you know the orbital period and orbital diameter of its moons.  Period is easy, but a major historical problem in solar system studies was finding the relative scale of *everything*: it's easy to measure angles and relative sizes with a telescope, but we need the actual length dimensions.  You need a baseline distance to start with, such as the distance from the Earth to the Sun: this was worked out [in the late 1600s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit#History): from that, the size of Jupiter, the size of its moons' orbits, and thus its mass and density could be found.\n\nSo even before 1700, astronomers realized that Jupiter was 300 times the mass of Earth, but with a density much less than that of rock.  Since the density known today is about 1.4 times that of water, I suppose that without knowledge of high-pressure physics they couldn't rule out a liquid water or ice planet, but scientists have known for over 300 years that Jupiter is definitely not a rocky world.  H. G. Wells was a fantastic writer, but he maybe wasn't so meticulous about doing his library research.\n\nThe story is laid out by Reta Beebe in [*Jupiter: The Giant Planet*](https://www.amazon.com/JUPITER-Smithsonian-Library-Solar-System/dp/1560986859) (1997).  \n",

Gravity on mars is lighter, so martians don't need stiff skeletons like we do, they're octopus-like. They're too floppy to walk in earth's gravity, so they blasted entire factories out of a giant gun pointed at earth, so within a few days of the factories crashing to the surface, they could build a small army of mechanical walkers to compensate for the gravity. H. G. Wells even invented the idea of the heat ray, and it doesn't make any fancy lights or sounds like Star Trek phasers, it just makes the air in its line of sight hot enough to combust whatever it's pointed at. And the accounts he gives of trying to fight off the aliens with 19th century weapons are awesome. War of the Worlds is some good-ass hard scifi.",

Due to alternative environmental pressures ALL organisms develop to excel in that environment, and that includes microorganisms.

If someone can point out a better answer as this seems half assed please do so but the papers on jupiter atmosphere modeling where not my cup of tea.\n\n\n\nBased on data in [this paper](https://watermark.silverchair.com/305.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAb8wggG7BgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGsMIIBqAIBADCCAaEGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMsqdhRrl5yc2Re91uAgEQgIIBcmNFvjSneWfmcn70Mr_lmMW18YsRmeH8HjaXwEVEYixTmMWf29jfUfUbGG9mqqpdynDoWzbezo8gfTcdH5iChQfZ5f8FWwQrz3tHBuflAYWIZxQ7V3yDxpH7jiWadrTtPsp5pKtAV6f2I1pPcsWyT2lnklGahywSFsUAvT8aH0uXmLg9EtRlq_JO00EwCqVKCoesVzvXwhJvH60dv-HCk8-TdTbwYC-0CorSwX1LIMjXVF5eikmg6Gl_IDV-nhxYmm9cQMJpX18FFPPPqoKPE_91ZeADHkS9fQe5soL7xkuEPzhXB4r0b395i8Empd881hhtIS00LLseH9SDXaqyjxgIqptGOZB-PbPMTSBec8zpWtgdgxLmK0nPId5ozxDXjBnAh0Ti_7GtNSQSAfi7q4li7qEi0V9ftEBf3-p7YzPVqvlEgDIhwRS-BoNEtM5c40uZGuu1ww03EF9XeWNRuEvxnhiOEHRaUt2aYD1dVdVW3Q8), body density with no air in the lungs varies from about 1.08 g/mL for a fairly thin male to 1.01 g/mL for a fairly fat male. Your results may vary.\n\nBut that's actually fairly close to water density at 20\u00b0C. Then I looked further into the subject to try to find where in the Jupiter atmosphere do we get this density and at what could be the viscosity at that altitude range.\n\nI came upon [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2vv4mf/what_does_the_radial_density_profile_of_the/colfzpn/) that was the only one to not take into account complicated PVT laws and modeling into account. Now we can assume we are at around 0.9 jovian radius to get the body density (let's say it's 1 g/cm3). This means we are in molecular hydrogen basically, with a temperature between 165K at the top and 6700K at the 0.8 r/R limit.\n\nAccording to [this paper on viscosity of dilute hydrogen](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/74A/jresv74An3p331_A1b.pdf), we can get the viscosity of dilute hydrogen gas from 15 to 5000 K. Looking at the bottom it shows that for our concerned temperatures we go from 0.3 to 0.7 g/cm-s. This is 30 to 70 mPa.s while water is 1 mPa.s at 20\u00b0C and honey is 10000 mPa.S so we would not be in but gravy is around that though.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMy background: Engineering bachelors and masters degrees in MSE.

And it continues to get hotter. Jupiter should have a composition similar to the nebula that formed our solar system, and heavier elements should be fairly rare, but they'll be there.\n\nThe thing is this. We don't know if the core of Jupiter is a heavy metal lump under all this massive pressure or if it's just a mix of all the elements and is undergoing convection, in which case the the heavy elements will be very dispersed.\n\nEven if all the heavy elements are concentrated in a core, they are extremely hot, and the boundary between super dense metallic hydrogen and the core wouldn't be so defined you could say it had a surface.\n\nAlso, on an interesting side note, it's been theorized that the pressure would cause carbon in the atmosphere to crystallize and form a diamond \"rain\", where denser diamond would slowly move down to the core.",

When the orbiting object is large, it actually gives you *more* information. You basically add one more step, instead of looking at how far the tiny object orbits from the big object you look at how far each object orbits from the \"barycenter\" the center of mass of the two different objects. Either orbit gives you the exact total mass of the two objects. You can then look at how far each body is from that barycenter to see how much mass of that total each of them takes. If the big mass is 3 times closer to the barycenter than its 3 times more massive that the smaller object.\n\nThere is a bit more uncertainty here, but you can still get pretty accurate.",

The affect of the planet's gravity on the *known* speed, direction, and mass of the space probe allowed us to calculate fairly precisely the amount of mass Jupiter would have to have in order to produce the seen affects.\n\nWe've known the distance to Jupiter and approximate size of the visible part of the planet, so once we knew the mass it was fairly simple to work out the density. Knowing the density allowed us to then say \"it is either all heavy gasses, or there are a lot of light gasses and something--perhaps Earth sized--at the center that is a solid core\". Considering that a few hundred Earths could fit inside Jupiter, the idea that the core might be Earth sized is impressive to us but in reality is some single-digit percent of the overall mass and volume of the planet. It would compare favorably to putting a peanut in the middle of the Capitol Rotunda and asking someone to find it blindfolded, using only one hand, while crawling on hands and knees. An Earth-size core is very (very) vanishingly small under the incredible amount of matter Jupiter has on hand.\n\nThe other fun thing with Jupiter that helps us determine its makeup is the fact that it is esssentially invisible to radar. This means it is comparable to clouds and air on Earth. We can see Venus on radar, we can see Mars, we can see the four big Moons of Jupiter on radar. But we can't see Jupiter itself except for the occasional wisp; on radar the moons of Jupiter appear to circle empty space. This implies that if there is anything solid there it is so buried as to be effectively non-existent for human purposes.\n\n[This is different from *radio* astronomy, which uses radio dishes to study radio emissions from planets and stars; in radio frequencies Jupiter is VERY loud].",

So a solid planet would rotate in alignment across all latitudes while gas objects (sun, Jupiter) typically have equatorial regions that rotate more quickly than areas closer to the poles.\n\n&gt; Examples of differential rotation are found throughout astronomy. In stars (including the Sun) and the gas giant planets, the equatorial regions rotate faster than regions closer to the poles, meaning that equatorial sunspots and cloud formations will move across the face of the object faster than their polar cousins.\n\nIn 1690, Giovanni Cassini was the first to discover the differential rotation within Jupiter's atmosphere. What I don't know though is whether that was exactly translated to: 'Jupiter must be a gaseous or gaseous-like body.'",

The inner core is solid because of all of the pressure on it, then the outer core is liquid because it's very hot and not under enough pressure to solidify, and then the mantle is solid but really hot and it flows over long periods of time like a really slow moving liquid. The crust is solid unless you're having a really bad day and that's what we're standing on (hopefully)",

            "comment": "u/astromike23 had a wonderful answer to this question that I'll repost:  \n\n\"For the interior of Jupiter, let's imagine taking a descent from cloud-tops down to the core based on our best guesses of what lies below.\n\nYou start falling through the high, white ammonia clouds starting at 0.5 atmospheres, where the Sun is still visible. It's very cold here, -150 C (-240 F). Your rate of descent is roughly 2.5x that of Earth, since gravity is much stronger on Jupiter.\n\nYou emerge out the bottom of the cloud deck somewhere near 1 atmosphere. It's still somewhat bright, with sunlight filtering through the ammonia clouds much like an overcast day on Earth. Below, you see the second cloud-deck made of roiling brown ammonium hydrosulphide, starting about 2 atmospheres.\n\nAs you fall through the bottom of this second cloud deck, it's now quite dark, but warming up as the pressure increases. Beneath you are white water clouds forming towering thunderstorms, with the darkness punctuated by bright flashes of lightning starting somewhere around 5 atmospheres. As you pass through this third and final cloud-deck it's now finally warmed up to room temperature, if only the pressure weren't starting to crush you.\n\nEmerging out the bottom, the pressure is now intense, and it's starting to get quite warm, and there's nothing but the dark abyss of ever-denser hydrogen gas beneath you. You fall through this abyss for a very, very long time.\n\nYou eventually start to notice that the atmosphere has become thick enough that you can swim through it. It's not quite liquid, not quite gas, but a \"supercritical fluid\" that shares properties of each. Your body would naturally stop falling and settle out somewhere at this level, where your density and the atmosphere's density are equal. However, you've brought your \"heavy boots\" and continue your descent.\n\nAfter a very, very long time of falling through ever greater pressure and heat, there's no longer complete darkness. The atmosphere is now warm enough that it begins to glow - red-hot at first, then yellow-hot, and finally white-hot.\n\nYou're now 30% of the way down, and have just hit the metallic region at 2 million atmospheres of pressure. Still glowing white-hot, hydrogen has become so dense as to become a liquid metal. It roils and convects, generating strong magnetic fields in the process.\n\nMost materials passing through this deep, deep ocean of liquid metallic hydrogen would instantly dissolve, but thankfully you've brought your unobtainium spacesuit...which is good, because it's now 10,000 C (18,000 F). Falling ever deeper through this hot glowing sea of liquid metal, you reflect that a mai tai would really hit the spot right about now.\n\nAfter a very, very, very long time falling through this liquid metal ocean, you're now 80% of the way down...when suddenly your boots hit a solid \"surface\", insomuch as you can call it a surface. Beneath you is a core weighing in at 25 Earth-masses, made of rock and exotic ices that can only exist under the crushing pressure of 25 million atmospheres.\n\nYou check your cell phone to tell you friends about your voyage...but sadly, it melted in the metallic ocean - and besides, they only have 3G down here.\n\nTL;DR: You would stop falling about 10% of the way down, where your density matches the density of the surrounding hydrogen \"supercritical fluid\".\"",

This is based on spectroscopy and other measurements which are plugged into computer models. Note the thick layer of the metallic hydrogen. This layer is roughly the thickness of **NINE** Earth's put end to end (9 times the diameter) (!!). So yeah, we aren't getting anywhere close to the core.\n\nIt is entirely possible that we might never know for sure. The reason for this is the intense conditions on the interior. I like to think of Jupiter as a \"failed star\" instead of just a planet like Earth with a huge atmosphere. I~~f there was a bit more mass in that region of the solar system when it was forming, Jupiter would have further condensed and we would have become a twin star system~~. **EDIT: As /u/feng_huang pointed out below, Jupiter would need to be about 100x more massive to have condensed into a star. One of my astronomy professors used to say that when the solar system formed, if Jupiter was more massive it would have sucked up some of the other gas giants mass if it went into a star. However, according to [this article](http://www.askamathematician.com/2011/06/q-how-close-is-jupiter-to-being-a-star-what-would-happen-to-us-if-it-were/), that idea is based off a old, outdated model of nuclear physics.....that astronomy professor was really old so I guess he wasnt staying current.**\n\nIt is believed that half, or more than half all the stars in the universe are binary star systems, so this type of formation is very common. \n\nAnd intense conditions on the interior might be an understatement. Models predict that near the core the temperature reaches 43,000\u00b0F (24,000\u00b0C), with pressure at the core being  650 million pounds of pressure per square inch. For comparison, at the depth of the deepest point in the ocean, the pressure is 16,000 pounds per square inch. We don't have a totally solid understanding of how matter even behaves at those conditions. For example, liquid metallic hydrogen, which they think makes up a large percentage of the interior, has actually never been observed so is a theoretical and exotic phase (in a sense) of hydrogen.\n\nEdit: whoops. Just realized I totally didn't answer your question, I meant to add a section at the end of my post about when we started figuring out the interior composition, but I got typing and forgot. Will update something when I get outta class. ",

In a very hypothetical situation where an object fell through the gas and liquid layers of Jupiter, it would encounter this metallic core and experience something similar to solid ground, although at those pressures and gravity we really don't know how the material behaves. It could be like a regular hard metal or more like a flowing semi-solid core, but either way so dense that it functions as a solid during an impact.",

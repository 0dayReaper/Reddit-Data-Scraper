I\u2019m curious only about well-documented, rigorous scientific support for these claims, which I\u2019m vaguely aware of but don\u2019t know where the claims come from.",

            "comment": "The Italian wastewater sample is universally agreed to be a false positive. The Italian lab wasn\u2019t able to replicate the findings, and we know that it\u2019s very easy to get false positives with PCR, especially since the sample was tested at a time when there was very high COVID positivity. \n\nNo one takes that report seriously today.\n\nThe genetic analysis of COVID very clearly shows that it arose around November to December of 2019:\n\n&gt;\tEstimates of the timing of the most recent common ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 made with current sequence data point to emergence of the virus in late November 2019 to early December 2019 \u2026\n\n\u2014[The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9)\n\n&gt;\tRather, the first zoonotic transmission likely occurred with lineage B viruses in late-November 2019 while the introduction of lineage A into humans likely occurred within weeks of the first event. Both strains were present at the market simultaneously.\n\n&gt;Researchers arrived at this conclusion by deciphering the evolutionary rate of viral genomes to deduce whether or not the two lineages diverged from a single common ancestor in humans. \n\n\u2014[Coronavirus Jumped to Humans at Least Twice at Market in Wuhan, China](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/coronavirus-jumped-to-humans-at-least-twice-at-market-in-wuhan-china)\n\n&gt;\tWe show that SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity before February 2020 likely comprised only two distinct viral lineages, denoted \u201cA\u201d and \u201cB.\u201d Phylodynamic rooting methods, coupled with epidemic simulations, reveal that these lineages were the result of at least two separate cross-species transmission events into humans. The first zoonotic transmission likely involved lineage B viruses around 18 November 2019 (23 October to 8 December), and the separate introduction of lineage A likely occurred within weeks of this event. **These findings indicate that it is unlikely that SARS-CoV-2 circulated widely in humans before November 2019** and define the narrow window between when SARS-CoV-2 first jumped into humans and when the first cases of COVID-19 were reported. \n\n\u2014[The molecular epidemiology of multiple zoonotic origins of SARS-CoV-2](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp8337)",

While I find the theory largely unconvincing, and to be dangerously wrapped up in some racist and anti-science narratives, it hasn't exactly been disproven.\n\nI think the biggest ding to the theory is that it's largely not relevant for policy. \n\nThe virus existed in nature and either crossed over to humans *somehow*. It doesn't super matter where it came from, we still need to study viruses in labs to understand them, add plasmids containing GFP (\"ooo 'gain of function' scary!!\"), Etc. \n\nIf it was a lab leak (and, again, almost certainly it wasn't) it does mean the labs in Wuhan need to adhere to their own BSL regulations... But they already knew that..",

Furthermore, another study that seemed at odds with the epidemiological data within the United States is the serological investigation conducted by the CDC on Red Cross blood samples from December 2019. This study discovered  the presence of COVID antibodies within the population that would translate to millions of covid cases existing undetected in the USA in December 2019.\n\nWhats your perspective on it?\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7799215/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7799215/)",

Every test has a false-positive rate, which for antibody assays includes technical errors and cross reactivity. This was a big problem very early in the pandemic, when people (like in this paper) were using ad hoc, unvalidated assays, but there is literally no way to make a perfect test with no false positives. Every reading of a test has to take this into account.  \n\nThis paper found up to 1% reactivity; their most specific test found 0.03%. They don\u2019t say what the false positive rate in their assay is, but it\u2019s well known that better, more validated assays have false-positive rates of up to 0.5% ([Unspecific reactivity must be excluded in COVID-19 epidemiological analyses or virus tracing based on serologic testing: Analysis of 46,777 post-pandemic samples and 1,114 pre-pandemic samples](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36465910/), among others). \n\nEarly in the pandemic, it\u2019s understandable that researchers want to ask important questions, using whatever tools they have, even if they\u2019re imperfect. But scientists don\u2019t read papers in a vacuum. You don\u2019t blindly look at contradictory results and say \u201chuh, they must both be true\u201d. You apply a basic understanding of reality, experience, and statistics. If there are contradictory findings (evidence of COVID when there was obviously no COVID) and a simple, obvious explanation (false positives are well understood and common) then you take the simple explanation.",

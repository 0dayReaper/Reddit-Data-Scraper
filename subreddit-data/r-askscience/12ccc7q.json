Typically it occurs when cold front overtakes warm front while both are moving in the same direction. Normally cold air mass moves faster than warm air mass.\n\nI was wondering if it was possible at all on Earth for warm front to move faster than cold front and form something like a reverse occluded front? Or just impossible?",

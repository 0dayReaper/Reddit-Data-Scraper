The lower limits have not yet been fully explored because smaller planets are harder to find.",

            "comment": "If by earthlike you mean liquid water on the surface, you need an atmosphere to keep it liquid.\n\nThe main driver here is how heavy the planet is. Less massive planets will in general have less atmosphere. Compare Mars or the Moon vs Earth or Venus. Half the size of Earth seems a good starting point if I had to put a rough guestimate down. On the upper end your planet can't be too massive, else it holds onto too much of an atmosphere and ends up as a Minineptune. Where exactly that border is still debated IIRC, it is a couple of Earth masses.\n\nThat is the primary driver. Temperature is going to play a role in this as well. A great example is Titan, which is about the size of our Moon, yet has a very dense atmosphere. This is due to it being much further from the sun than our moon.\nAdd to that the evolution of the planet as it forms and you'll end up with some pretty wild options.\n\nHope that helps somewhat. Let me know if you got more questions.",

We are assuming \"earth-like\" implies a broadly similar composition.",

One of the biggest things will be gravity. Too much and it wouldn't sustain life like we know it - even things such as sending satellites into orbit wouldnt be impossible - (a problem with super earth findings) - lower limits may present opposite problems for humans or there may not be enough minerals or resources on the lower levels.",

Just not one we've seen. \n\nI don't know of a known precise lower limit.",

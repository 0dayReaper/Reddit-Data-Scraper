                            "comment": "Having a greater number of olfactory receptors does not mean, by itself, that dogs can smell more *different kinds* of smells than us. A hypothetical animal could have 300 *billion* olfactory receptors, but if they were all the same *kind* of olfactory receptor, that animal would only be able to smell one thing (albeit extremely well.)\n\nWhat *does* make a difference is how many *different* types of olfactory receptors an animal has. Humans have about 900 genes for different kinds of olfactory receptors, 63% of which are believed to be \u201cpseudogenes\u201d\u2026in our DNA but not functional. Dogs, by contrast, have an estimated [1300 genes for olfactory receptors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC329419/), only 18% of which are likely pseudogenes.\n\nSo dogs\u2019 DNA equips them with significantly many more *different kinds* of olfactory receptors than humans, meaning yes, there are many types of odor chemicals that dogs can smell and we cannot.\n\nThat same study also found 112 human olfactory receptor genes that did not appear in dogs\u2026even though most of these are probably pseudogenes, this does suggest that there will be a small number of smells that *we* can smell but dogs can\u2019t!",

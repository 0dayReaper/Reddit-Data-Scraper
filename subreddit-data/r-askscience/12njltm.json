Being awake and alert alone feels great, and coincides with the hormones and neurotransmitters that make you feel good.\n\nI'm sure you've heard about if not used blue light filters and \"night mode\" on devices.  For the same reason they keep you awake, the sun does this to the extreme.\n\nThen you have the fact that the sunlight is energy.  When it hits you, some of it turns to thermal energy.   While humans are not cold blooded, it is still beneficial to your body to have an outside source of energy.  Being sleepy and tired is coincidentally \"energy conservation - fuel economy\" mode for our bodies.  Being warm blooded with an external source of heat, you now have surplus energy.  Your body naturally responds with ,NOW is the time to do stuff.   We can expend energy doing things instead of keeping blood warm.  In fact it might want to get rid of the energy (cool off).  To do this, you want the largest possible surface area/volume of blood at the surface of your skin.  More blood flow - more oxygen - more energy - more nutrients - just feeling *awake and alive* in general.\n\nTLDR: many biological nuances and evolutionary reasons all coming together to be active when its nice out, experienced conscious and sub-consciously as pleasant.",

The sun itself definitely doesn't make you sleepy.  Every muscle movement is more heat you can't dissipate easily.  This is one of those times your body wants to minimize all efforts and functions. As in, time to take a nap.  \n\nIt's not like you can't be tired on a nice day, or awake without the sun.  There are so many factors that obviously it doesn't make sense to say \"well I was tired on a nice day once, so what about that\" lol",

When someone who doesn't have those specific mutations is forced into those climates, or if the weather patterns change enough, that's when you see them get headaches (*incompatible diet, more hydration needed than usual, etc*), acne (*incompatible diet, too much perspiration for their skin type, etc*), depression (*less sunlight or time outside could cause this for people, such as summer vs winter*), so on and so forth.",

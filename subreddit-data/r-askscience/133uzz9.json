    "postText": "Hello r/askscience,\n\nI was wondering if anyone is aware of any papers out there that investigate political beliefs while controlling for both education and occupation.\n\nFor context, I had a discussion with someone who was explaining that having a college degree is associated with being more liberal. I was wondering if that relationship still held up when controlling for occupation: is it the careers that college educated people end up in that make them more liberal?\n\nE.g. a couple small business owners I know are more conservative and don\u2019t have college degrees, is it being a small business owner that makes them more conservative? Or not having spent the 4 years in college?\n\nI looked around for some research on this but didn\u2019t have much luck finding exactly what I was looking for. Thanks in advance.",

            "comment": "Like most things in life it is a bidirectional relationship. People ask the question - is it nature or nurture that drives development - the reality is both. We call these [gene x environment correlations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/B9780128093245218269) \\- that is, what is innate to you (nature) makes you seek out certain things which in turn is reinforced by that environment you sought out or you are surrounded by (nurture).\n\nWith careers it's been found that people in certain careers tend to have typecasted beliefs, morals, attitudes so on.  Not everyone is one-to-one the same of course, but it's been found that politicians tend to have higher levels of compulsive lying, and otherwise emotionally manipulative and become more so the deeper they are into the career. Soldiers become more emotionally numb or cold, hardened if you will, as of a result of their career choices. Psychologists are said to be more open-minded of others.\n\nWith that in mind, let's return to my original point. People of certain political beliefs tend to have a certain way of thinking - conservatives value money and \"traditional\" beliefs, liberals are argued to be open-minded etc (these are simplifications obviously, but bear with me). It's not surprising therefore, that someone who seeks more traditional ways of work (avoid schooling in a university) and value more monetary gain would seek careers that allow them to achieve said goal. The choices necessary to succeed in said career (wanting more economic freedom - ie. less government oversight over business) would in turn reinforce those beliefs and make it a stronger pattern in the person's character.",

When it comes to economic issues, it's people with *less* education who tend to be more left-wing, though I believe the association is weaker.\n\nSee, e.g., [this study](https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1475-6765.12486) of 15 European countries:\n\n&gt; Building on both theoretical approaches, I analyze 2016 European Social Survey data from 15 Western European countries. I find that education has a negative relationship to support for an expansive welfare state. By contrast, education is strongly positively associated with perceptions of welfare state beneficiaries as deserving [I disagree with this characterization of the questions used for this measure]\n\n[This UK study](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-4446.12972) finds that education is associated with economic conservatism, but that the effect is probably not causal. It also refers to the association between educational attainment and economic conservatism as a fairly typical finding.\n\nI'm having trouble finding a study examining this particular question in the US.",

It'll be some combination of:\n\nMaternal health prior to and during pregnancy\n\nHome situation with regard to wealth level\n\nParents occupation\n\nLocation \n\nEducation\n\nTrauma levels associated therewith\n\nThen subsequently...\n\nOccupation\n\nLived experiences in personal, adult life\n \n And some other stuff to boot that I can't think of. It is doubtful in the extreme that an accurate metric for how political belief forms, can be boiled down to just either occupation or education.",

There's clearly a correlation between income and education, but most folks will fall on one side or the other of that trend line. \n\nEducators are known for making low wages for their level of education, and often tend to be liberal. Business owners without a lot of formal education often have plenty of income and don't appreciate being taxed or told what to do, skewing them toward conservatism. Lawyers and accountants and such tend to be highly educated high earners, and it's my perception that they tend to go either way politically.\n\nIt'd be interesting to find some data on these questions!",

The truth of the matter is that political ideology is largely dictated by personality, as there are noticeable personality differences that tend to differentiate right and left. These personality traits also tend to drive people towards certain educational and career paths. The education doesn't cause the outcome of being more liberal, it's the other way around.",

            "comment": "There have been multiple studies showing that people who simply take an economics course while in college tend to become more selfish with their money and subsequently start to lean conservative on that front.  In contrast, the political science field tends to be dominated by liberal thinkers.  So some of the answer to your question is that it may depend on what subject is studied and also whether you choose to separate economic conservatism from other political conservatism.\n\nIn that vein, I find it interesting how there kind of opposing forces among finance majors vs accountants.  The finance majors I know tend to want free unregulated markets and have been pushing back against anti-trust legislation for years.  In contrast, accountants actually study things like why Enron crashed and why the mortgage market failed and tend to argue for putting this kind of regulation back into place.  (The power hungry CFOs you see in the news are the exception, not the norm.)  Considering how closely education is tied to occupation for both of these fields, its hard to separate the two within the context of how I think you've asked the question.\n\nJust some humble opinion based on self sampled (and therefore poor) data, but what I have noticed is that people who study politics and history tend to have a better understanding of things like what the social contract actually means, what the underlying principals of the US Constitution are (not to mention what is actually in and not in it) and what the social effects of having personal freedoms repressed are on a country's population.  Certainly you can find the existence conservative political science majors, but the field tends to be dominated more by liberals.  Similarly, people with degrees in creative/performing arts are more directly affected by laws that limit the kind of art they can create or perform.  For example, it really shouldn't be a surprise that authors become liberal when their books suddenly start becoming banned.  There is also a line of thought that people who go to a four year college often get direct exposure to people or ideas that they have been told are bad, but then discover that this misconceptions are really a byproduct of uneducated prejudice.  Again an example, you tend to stop believing that immigrants are bad people when the Hispanic sitting next to you in physics class end up becoming an engineer and you eventually learn that your best friend is a pagan.\n\nWhat I would say personally is that having a math degree with an emphasis on sciences has probably indirectly pushed my towards liberalism.  I've never really been a person who wanted to identify with either a political party or label.  But I do know how to evaluate evidence and its not my fault that conservative politics has, by their own admission, chosen to latch on to \"alternative facts\" as the bedrock of their beliefs.  So... am I driven to liberal policies because of my education, or am I driven to them because conservative politicians can't be bothered to put forward verifiable evidence?\n\nSciencey link thingy:\n\nhttps://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1306&amp;context=econ\\_workingpaper",

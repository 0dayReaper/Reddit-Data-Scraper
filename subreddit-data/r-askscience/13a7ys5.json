Webs require too much maintenance and are sufficiently complex that it's not practical to take over.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of different spiders that use other spiders webs. Everything from social spiders (who collaborate for various reasons), to kleptoparasites like Dewdrop spiders (that nest near orbweaver webs to steal food) to pirate spiders that use other spiders webs to lure them out and eat them.",

The spiders themselves were fairly bright yellow-green, with red spots at their leg joints and were 2-3 inches in diameter.  Each web was huge, often covering entire 10 foot tall bushes and contained a couple dozen of these spiders that were constantly moving around in the web.  \n\nI noped out of there pretty quickly but have always wondered what the species was.",

            "comment": "Can they? Yes! Do they? Rarely.\n\nSo to *disentangle* this question, we can delineate between a few different types of stealing:\n\n1. Stealing of the web as a structure\n2. Stealing of the silk as a substance\n3. Stealing of the prey as a goal\n\nWhen you asked this question, I assume you were predominantly thinking about number 1; where a spider evicts another somehow and then uses the prebuilt web to either save on resources or because its location is good. I don't know of any spiders that really do this as a major behaviour, but (Tso &amp; Severinghaus, 1997) has a good summary of the different types of kleptoparasitism in spiders.\n\nWhat we do have records of is a little bit of #2 and a lot of #3. So in a bunch of Vollrath's work (such as Vollrath, 1979) we see spiders of the _Argyrodes_ genus stealing prey from the webs of other much larger spiders. This is the classic form of kleptoparasitism in spiders. There are also occasions where we have seen _Argyrodes lanyuensis_ stealing the actual silk from larger spiders, likely to save resources. This is rare however, and I can't find much in the literature talking about it!\n\nOne thing to point out here is that kleptoparasitic spiders seem to usually be of the Theridiidae, or the tangleweb spiders. They seem to generally be much smaller than their victims (often members of the Araneidae family, the orb-weavers). Thus in a lot of cases the webs would be way too big and specialised on much larger prey than the kleptoparasite would really want to take on or eat on its own. \n\nLong story short, it looks like kleptoparasites do much better by just stealing food from others most of the time. The specialisations to stealing from other spiders make it disadvantageous to actually use the victim's structure due to size differences. Spiders do steal silk but it is really rare.\n\n(bonus fact, being stolen from seems to change the investment of _Nephila_ spp. into the silk of their webs, but not per se into their macrostructure. They instead seem to reduce the width of the silk itself. This implies that there is a certain limit to the shape of the web structures that the spiders must follow, even in an adverse feeding or nutritional regime)\n\n**Sources**\n\n- (Tso &amp; Severinghaus, 1997) - https://doi.org/10.1006/anbe.1998.0770\n- (Vollrath, 1979) - https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-3472(79)90186-6\n- My own in-prep PhD on spider web morphology\n\n*If you find this stuff interesting, there are very few people who study spider webs and so much that we do not know! We could do with more! Please look into it further or feel free to message me!*",

Yes I was thinking of number 1: I had a tiny cobweb on the side of my windowsill for the longest time and just left it there. About a week ago when the weather turned cold I saw a tiny spider now inhabiting the old cobweb. Hence why I asked the question. I don't really know what breed/type of spider it is, not a creepy crawlies expert, but alot of the replies have given me insight haha. Thanks everyone for all the knowledge tidbits, especially about kleptoparasitism!",

ARACHNID RESTAURANT - NIGHT\n\nA male bolas spider, JAKE, and a female bolas spider, LUCY, are sitting on a rock that passes for a small table in the corner of the restaurant. The restaurant is dimly lit, with flickering torches on the walls casting shadows on the cobweb curtains.\n\nA waiter approaches their table, carrying a platter covered with spider silk.\n\nWAITER:\n(vibrating his abdomen)\nGood evening. Tonight's special is spider silk served on a platter. Would you like to try it?\n\nJake and Lucy nod eagerly. The waiter uncovers the platter, revealing a shimmering web of silk that glows in the candlelight.\n\nThe waiter places the platter in front of them and leaves. Jake and Lucy both grab a strand of silk and start to eat, each one trying to avoid getting it tangled on their pedipalps.\n\nAs they eat, they start to relax. They vibrate their abdomens in a rhythmic pattern, a sign of contentment.\n\nSuddenly, their pedipalps get tangled on a single strand of silk. They both try to pull away, but they end up tugging at the same strand, their faces getting closer and closer until their mouths meet.\n\nThey're both surprised but feel a spark between them. They lean towards each other, their faces getting closer, their eyes meeting. \n\nSuddenly, a strand of silk gets caught on a nearby candle, and the flame starts to spread along the web. Jake and Lucy quickly realize the danger and work together to extinguish the flame before it spreads, but it's too late.\n\nThe flames spread rapidly, and soon the entire web is engulfed in fire. Jake and Lucy frantically search for a way to put out the flames, but they're too small to make a difference.\n\nThey need help.\n\nJake vibrates his abdomen rapidly, sending out an alarm signal. The vibrations alert a nearby group of spiders, who rush into the restaurant in little helmets and carrying tiny fire extinguishers.\n\nThe spiders work together, spraying the flames with their extinguishers and using their web-spinning abilities to create a barrier between the fire and the rest of the restaurant.\n\nHowever, the spider silk barrier they create only serves to exacerbate the flames, causing the fire to spread more quickly.\n\nSPIDER #1:\n(vibrating his abdomen)\nWe need to think of a new plan!\n\nSPIDER #2:\n(vibrating his abdomen)\nWe can't let the fire spread any further!\n\nSPIDER #3:\n(vibrating his abdomen)\nI have an idea! We can use our silk to smother the fire!\n\nThe spiders work quickly, spinning webs and weaving them into a thick, dense blanket of silk. They use their tiny extinguishers to spray the flames while the others weave the blanket.\n\nBut the silk quickly catches fire, and the flames spread even more rapidly.\n\nSPIDER #4:\n(vibrating his abdomen)\nThis isn't working! We need to try something else!\n\nSPIDER #5:\n(vibrating his abdomen)\nWhat if we create a barrier around the perimeter to starve the fire of oxygen?\n\nSPIDER #1:\n(vibrating his abdomen)\nThat's a great idea! Let's do it!\n\nThe spiders quickly get to work, weaving thick layers of silk around the perimeter of the restaurant. The silk barrier is dense enough to block out the oxygen, and the fire slowly starts to die down.\n\nAfter a few tense minutes, the flames are extinguished.\n\nJake and Lucy sit back down at their rock, feeling a newfound appreciation for each other and the dangers that come with living in the desert.\n\nFADE OUT.\n\n**More realistically, it would be closer to this**:\n\nJake and Lucy, two spiders of the same species which probably don't actually have names, find themselves attracted to each other. \n\nThey notice each other's physical characteristics and behavior, and Jake decides to approach Lucy. He begins a courtship display, using his legs to move in a specific pattern that he knows will attract Lucy's attention.\n\nLucy observes Jake's display, assessing his fitness as a potential mate. If Jake's display is not impressive, Lucy may ignore him or even attack him. However, she finds him acceptable and responds with her own movements, indicating her interest in mating.\n\nJake, now encouraged, approaches Lucy and presents her with a small bundle of silk. Lucy examines it, assessing its quality and Jake's ability to provide for her and their potential offspring.\n\nIf Lucy accepts the silk, she may allow Jake to mate with her. The two, lacking the capacity or instinct for love, will then separate, and Jake will move on to find other females to mate with. Lucy, meanwhile, will take care of the eggs and young until they are old enough to fend for themselves.",

You actually could make clothes out of spider silk-- currently things like bullet proof clothing and surgical thread could be applications of super strong spider thread.  Its nowhere near accessible enough to be regular clothes though, at least not yet :)",

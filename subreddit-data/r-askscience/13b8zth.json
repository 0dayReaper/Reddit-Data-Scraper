            "comment": "Speed of sound for a material is (approximately, in the linear region of a material) sqrt(K/rho) where K is elastic stiffness and rho is material density*. This is _kind of_ intuitive, it's easier to push on a material to transfer momentum if it's lighter (less dense).\n\nHumid air still approximately acts like an ideal gas and thus has an approximately the same number of molecules in a given volume. But now some of the molecules are light H2O molecules instead of heavier O2, N3, etc molecules. So humid air is less dense, and thus has higher sound speed.\n\n*This is sort of a general result for a wave equation relating the wave velocity via a \"restoring force\" and \"inertial property\". You can replace K with a more specific term with individual parameters for an ideal gas, etc.",

Doesn't matter whether it's hydrogen or helium, you'll have the same number of particles in 1L of the gas.\n\nMight sound like a given, but gases where particles have adhesive or repulsive forces, or where particles stick to each other and so on may occupy larger or smaller volumes. And it's definitely not true for solids and liquids. Some people's intuition might say humid air is the same as dry air but extra water molecules in between, which isn't the case.",

Solids and liquids have higher speeds because of their higher bulk elasticity/stiffness. \n\nPushing on solids has a high stiffness which means a high restoring force towards the equilibrium during wave propagation, thus faster propagation",

            "comment": "The fact that sound travels faster in humid and hot air is based on certain restrictions:\n\nSound is nothing but vibration in air that propogates by transfer of energy. When we speak our vocal cord generates distrubance a kind of force/energy is transfereed to make near to stationaey air molecules into motion. That motion needs to be transferred by means of collisions.\n\n**Sound travels fastest through materials that are stiff and light. In general, sound travels fastest through solids, slower through liquids and slowest through gasses. Beacuse solid are tightly packed and thus transfer of force is faster as molevules are near to each other**\n\n1) Considering Volume - Gaseous molecules expand and occupy much volume compared to vapour molecules. If that is consideres density is inversely proportional to volume and thus vapour would be more dense.   \n**Fact Here :- Talking about sound and air as medium we should be considering open space and this we can assume infinite volume. That way density is directly proportioal to mass and volume factor can be neglected. Gases are dimolecules and have high molecular mass compared to h2o vapor.**\n\n2) Another way to look: Gases have more volume of expansion while vapour will have less expansion so the loss of sound energy due to distribution around area will increase as sound wave will be surrounded on all sides by gases. But in case of vapour the volume they ocgupy is low and thus distribution of soumd wave will be stremlined\n\n**So humid air is less dense -&gt; less resistance -&gt; more speed.** (when volume is considred infinite)\n\n3) Hot air: **Air molecules move faster in hot and humid environments due to their increased thermal energy. Since sound relies on molecules bumping into one another to create compressions and rarefactions, increased speed of molecules makes the sound waves move faster.**\n\nAir molecules move faster in hot and humid environments due to their increased thermal energy. \nSince sound relies on molecules bumping into one another to create compressions and rarefactions, increased speed of molecules makes the sound waves move faster.\u00a0\n\n\nConclusion:   \n**Humidity:- replaces the typical air composition and creates a less dense but stiffer environmemt, less density  contribute to lesser resistence and more stiffness compared to gas will contribute to ease of transfer because of increased probablity or streamlined collision.**    \n\n**Heat:- Air molecules move faster in hot and humid environments due to their increased thermal energy. Since sound relies on molecules bumping into one another to create compressions and rarefactions, increased speed of molecules makes the sound waves move faster.**",

            "comment": "Sound actually travels faster in humid air compared to dry air. The speed of sound is determined by the properties of the medium through which it travels, such as temperature, density, and elasticity. Humidity, which refers to the amount of water vapor present in the air, affects these properties.\n\nIn general, humid air is denser than dry air because the presence of water vapor increases the overall molecular mass of the air. This increased density leads to an increase in the speed of sound. Water vapor molecules also contribute to the elasticity of the air, allowing sound waves to propagate more efficiently.\n\nAlso humidity affects the speed of sound through its influence on temperature. Humid air tends to have a higher temperature compared to dry air at the same ambient conditions. Since the speed of sound is directly proportional to temperature, the higher temperature in humid air further contributes to an increase in the speed of sound. The effect of humidity on the speed of sound is relatively small compared to other factors such as temperature. Nevertheless, in general, sound does travel faster in humid air than in dry air.",

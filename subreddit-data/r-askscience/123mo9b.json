Is it that there is wind disturbance by skyscrapers? Could pollution actually be saving cities from the wind? Is there some weather thing nudging tornadoes away from major cities? \n\nI don't know anything about the actual science of meteorology, so I hope if there is answer, it isn't too complicated.",

For instance, I live in SW Ohio near Cincinnati, which (if you squint just right) is kind of on the car eastern edge of tornado country. My specific part of the area is hilly\u2014I can just about see the Ohio River from my house, and the Little Miami River is just west of us. But west (including DE Indiana) and north of Cincinnati is much more flat, and it seems like there are many more tornadoes in those areas than in my area to the east. When we get tornado warnings, the maps of high-risk areas appear to skirt the elevation changes. (Though this did not stop a tornado from touching down about 1500 feet from my house in 2017. Lots of trees down, including three 100-foot pines in my yards, and roof damage to two houses, but no injuries.)",

But we dont really fully understand the nature of tornados entirely with valleys and hill elevation. A tornado close to my hometown had a massive tornado in 2004 in Utica Ill. where the path of the tornado entered the valley and never climbed elevation, rather, just sat in the valley destroying the town before dissipating before travelling up the hill.",

They always skirt around us, or pick up west of us or touch down on the east.\n\nSome have speculated that it's due to our position in a valley and the position of a couple of rivers that deter them for some reason. Others have said Native Americans blessed the region. I put more stock in the former explanation :|",

In fact there are several major Tornados that struck valleys well outside of Tornado alley (Portland Oregon, Mechanicville, NY) and the valleys are believed to be a huge factor in their formation. What happens is the natural topography can funnel air and cause rotation if the conditions are just right.  \n\n\nThe odds of a specific town taking a direct hit of an F3+ is low. There are thousands of towns in tornado alley that have never had one. There isnt a square inch of the US that is immune to Tornadic activity.",

But conversely, regarding OP\u2019s phrasing\n\n&gt; they can flatten entire towns. But I don't recall them flattening entire cities\n\nThis is because cities are relatively *big*, compared to towns. The typical tornado tops out around 500yards wide ([source](https://www.fema.gov/pdf/plan/6-ch-h.pdf)). So the \u201cflattened\u201d area is a track around this width maximum \u2014 enough to wipe out the business district of a small town if it goes directly through, but too small to cover much of a large town or city.",

            "comment": "In the US, The weather pattern that causes the strongest tornadoes is where the air sweeping from the mountains down across the dry plains meets the wetter air of the eastern half of the country.  This happens to coincide with the most agricultural part of the country.  So part of it is just that it's an area where cities tend to be small pinpoint areas surrounded by lots of farmland.  Even purely random odds would still make it far more likely to hit a farm than a city block.  If tornadoes DID hit cities just as often as they hit farmland, THAT would be the unusual bias that would need an explanation.  By random chance, they shouldn't.\n\nThat being said, there are some small effects that do help make tornadoes become a little weaker once they do hit a city, (if it's a city with tall enough buildings anyway and not a small farming city where most of the buildings are under 4 stories high.)  If the tornado runs across broken-up ground that's not flat, that does dissipate a bit of its energy, and a city made of tall buildings is definitely not flat - it's a lot of little canyons (streets) in between tall cliff walls (buildings).  This doesn't make cities any less likely to be hit - just makes them less likely to be hit by a giant world-news generating F5.\n\nThe suburbs of big cities, on the other hand, do get hit by large magnitude storms.  They don't have buildings tall enough to break up the energy.",

In 2016, I was living in St. Louis for two years, and finally a tornado hit in the heart of midtown Tulsa. I couldn\u2019t believe it, I moved away and within six months Tulsa had its first tornado in decades. From what I understand, there may be something to the idea that the heat produced by cities has some kind of affect on a storm\u2019s convection, but it seems equally possible that it\u2019s just random chance.",

Something about the direction that powerful storms tend to move in this area, and the slope of the broad valley that the city occupies, and many other factors that have difficult to model impacts on storms may have created a \"sweet spot\" where settlers rarely were devastated by storms, so the city grew.",

            "comment": "As some other users have listed, there are incidences of tornadoes hitting downtown areas with devastating consequences.\n\nHowever there is data to back up the claim that cities don't succumb as often to adverse weather events like tornadoes, most of which is due to geography and/or surface makeup of the region.  Different elevations, or rather rapid changes in elevations, for example the city of Pittsburgh, PA and to a lesser extent Columbus, OH, being in a bowl depression can trap higher/lower pressure air and prevent storm systems from strengthening above the city.  The American west just east of the Rockies is another example, as the Rocky Mountains push moist air upward and cause clouds to condense and precipitate on the westward slopes before blowing east, resulting in drier conditions on the eastern slopes and in the plains.\n\nThe other factor is that most cities' surface geologies are made up of concrete and asphalt, which limits the moisture in the air from evaporation, and also radiates heat in the summer, creating a higher ambient pressure relative to the surrounding areas.  Taller buildings can cause the same precipitation phenomenon that the Rockies do with the prevailing westerlies, albeit to a much lesser extent.  You can actually see this happen in real time if you watch the weather radar maps around some cities; the weather system more or less \"breaks up\" or \"dissipates\" as it blows into the city and surrounding suburbs.\n\nSource is just stuff I remember from Boy Scouts and being a weather nerd watching the weather channel on breaks at one of my old jobs.",

Tornadoes are normally really actually localized events and create smaller trails of destruction than one might think and do not get more than a mile wide at the biggest of them, so not large enough to decimate a massive suburban city system that happens to be the largest landlocked city system on earth accounting for total urban sprawl, and we have nearly 10 million people here between and around both major cities of the Metroplex. I am 39 and lived here my whole life, so have seen a ton of tornado damage here over my nearly 4 decades of life, but as mentioned, they are very locally restricted and can not ever truly wipe out the entire Metroplex in 1 fell swoop, impossible considering we are such a massive point of light in North Central Texas visible from space. \n\n[Just check out the night time view of the DFW Metroplex from space.](https://s.hdnux.com/photos/60/40/11/12714585/4/ratio3x2_1200.jpg)\n\nHere is a video on the 2000 Fort Wort tornado that directly hit down town skyscrapers and high-rises. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVMGznzHmC0",

We get 5-10 or so small ones near here each year, and they usually take expected paths due to the lack of flat terrain (including city areas).  Vortexes are sensitive to any disruption, so those really big tornadoes really only happen where the land is flat and wide open. \n\n Big buildings don't allow vortexes to gain the amount of energy as in a big field.  The reason for this is because a tornado is like an upside-down drain that is draining all the heat up into the cooler atmosphere.  The more junk around (landscape, water, big buildings, etc) create turbulence and slow down that drain of heat sometimes clogging it altogether.  \n\nThe other reason you tend to see rural areas flattened and cities not, is that tornado prone cities are mostly east of the Mississippi.  The housing stock for a lot of the urban areas in the east is very old and extremely overbuilt.  My house literally has whole old growth tree trunks holding it up with 12\"x12\" old growth beams attaching it to the foundation.  The sheer amount of plaster and old wood in my home is probably at least 10x the weight of the typical manufactured home of the same size, that you see in most of these small southern towns. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe real truth of it is that if you build your house better, it won't fly away.  We regularly get derechos which have winds in excess of tornadoes, for longer period of time of a tornado, and mostly there is little damage to homes around here.",

The NW side of town would sustain lots of damage, while my area almost never had any. The storm would then seem to \"reconvene\"  a couple miles SE of my house and continue with it's destruction in rural areas.

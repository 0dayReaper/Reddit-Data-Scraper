    "postText": "Hello,\nI know that propranolol binds to beta adrenergic receptor as a beta blocker medication, which prevents epinephrine, a hormone crucial for the activation of phosphorylase and thus glycogenolysis, from binding to the receptor and causing its well known effects. Does that mean propranolol interfers with that process? How does that effect metabolism? How does the body respond?",

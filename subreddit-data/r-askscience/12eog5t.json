Is it permanently compressed, or would it explode in size when you removed it from the gravity of the rest of it?",

            "comment": "Another approach to answering this question is that when two neutron stars collide, in the resulting explosion called a \"[kilonova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilonova),\" a portion of the neutron stars' matter gets thrown off.  This thrown off, decompressing degenerate neutron star matter initiates what is called the \"[r-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process)\" or \"rapid neutron-capture process\" which is pretty much the only way atoms bigger than Iron are forged.\n\nThe first confirmed detection of a neutron star-neutron star collision is said to have generated \"[16,000 times the mass of the Earth in heavy elements and tens of times the mass of the Earth in gold and platinum](https://wtop.com/the-space-place/2017/10/wondrous-discovery-kilonova-may-explain-gold-platinum-uranium-created/)\"\n\nSo in a way, the answer to your question is, \"That's how gold is made.\"",

I mean, how did that shit get here? Are streamers of neutron star explosion debris flying randomly through the 'verse and getting entangled in the \"dust cloud\" that coalesces into a solar system? \n\nIt's incredible that any of this stuff works at all!",

Thus essentially all of the helium Earth started with boiled off our atmosphere looooong ago.  \n\nPretty much all the helium we have now is fission products from the radio active decay of heavier radio active elements that pop out \u201calpha particles\u201d which are helium nuclei.",

We might look at a predicted rate of an occurence - say we state some particular star-related event has only a 1 in 10 million chance of happening every century.\n\nWell, there is somewhere between 100 billion and 400 billion stars just in our own galaxy, so that '1 in 10 million per century' is going to happen about ten thousand times at least - about 100 times a year or slightly more than every 4 days (or if we use the upper limit of stars, pretty much daily).\n\nIt's a little bit like the LIGO detector - I can't find the numbers but I'm pretty sure the predicated rate of observations was quite low, then we switched it on and have observed far more than anticipated.",

I don't know how likely this is in reality though. Things were pretty wild back at the dawn of the universe.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Maybe this is why there are no visible advanced civilisations, they don't have copper, nickle or nuclear material to get them past the Iron age?\n\nOr they just haven't gotten there yet. It's a common sci-fi trope where spacefaring humans encounter the remnants of \"Ancients\" - civilisations who existed long before we did and had super-advanced technology (but almost always vanish, leaving behind star gates or whatever)... but there's reasonable odds ***we*** are potentially one of the Ancients. Understandably, we tend to think in human terms - 13.8 billion years seems like an incredibly long time to us when our lifespan is 80 \\~ 100 years at best.\n\nHowever, if our estimates are correct, it will take about 100 trillion years before star formation ends. If that is accurate, we exist in the first 0.0138% of the total star-forming period of the universe.",

The use of 'nearly' is, for most of us, quite an understatement though.\n\nIt's like looking at a sheet of metal that's been buffed to a mirror shine. We might look at it from arm's length and say \"that's incredibly smooth!\" but we zoom in and start looking at it on a much smaller scale we see massive imperfections - ridges, valleys and mountains form.\n\nMy favourite thought experiment in this regard is our own planet. Anyone who has had to traverse a valley or a mountain (or driven offroad) is going to tell you that the Earth is not smooth. Yet, if we shrunk the earth down to the size of a billiard ball, it would be much smoother than that billiard ball.\n\nSorry, I get carried away with sort of thing because it's all so fascinating. I guess what I'm trying to say is that, sure, on the grand scale of the universe you're probably right. But is it possible that any given region within a galaxy hasn't been \"littered\" with debris from neutron star collisions? I'd say that's possible, but only over the sum of all galaxies. I don't know the likelihood within our own Milky Way.",

If you pulled it away quickly, as soon as it was free of the forces holding it together, it would explode with an absolutely insane amount of force, likely orders of magnitude more than any modern nuclear bomb.   Anyone or anything close enough to meaningfully observe the affair would likely be completely obliterated into base molecules and atoms.",

The concept is though with gravity (inward pressure) battling either nuclear fusion or one of the degeneracy pressures (outward pressure). Neutron stars also, for reasons I can't explain with my limited knowledge, get smaller as their mass increases. Knowing this, neutron stars do have a mass limit where gravity will overcome that outward pressure and collapse it instantly into a black hole. That limit is roughly 2.2 solar masses, though some observations seemed to have slightly exceeded this. The collapsing of a neutron star mostly happens in neutron star collisions, and from a neutron star eating a white dwarf.",

            "comment": "The matter inside a neutron star is a form of degenerate matter where, all subatomic particles essentially are mashed together into tightly packed neutrons. The neutrons are about as tightly packed as they possibly can be without collapsing into a black hole. The only thing preventing further collapse is a phenomenon called degeneracy pressure, which is a result of the Pauli exclusion principle. This principle provides that no two fermions (neutrons are a type of fermion) can share quantum states. Effectively this means that two neutrons cannot exist inside eachother at the same time, they must stay separate. As a result, the two particles will resist further compaction with an outward force to maintain equilibrium.\n\nBasically, neutron star matter, called neutronium, really doesn't want to be compacted to that extent. The only thing keeping neutronium stable is the enormous gravitational pressure of the object as a whole. If you could somehow remove a piece of it from the star, it would immediately release all the energy it needed to keep itself stable under gravitational pressure. The result: an enormous explosion with all the neutronium decaying into other subatomic particles. A teaspoon of neutronium exploding would be unimaginably destructive. Like shattering the Earth levels of destruction.",

The familiar Coulombic (electric) forces are overcome and yet the star has reached a stable-ish state. Degeneracy pressure is what keeps it from further compression. It is quite literally the Pauli Exclusion principle acting on the neutrons, they can't collapse further or they would begin to occupy the same place, at the same time, with the same quantum states, which nature really really abhors.\n\nSo if you removed them, somehow teleported a teaspoon elsewhere outside the gravitational field, they would expand, turn back into protons, electrons, and neutrons and perhaps form atoms depending on the speed of the reactions, forces, etc and ofc explode.   \n\n\n\\*saw some one else responded with this as well",

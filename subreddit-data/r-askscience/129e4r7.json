In the air, the radar bounces off of... well... not the air. It only bounces off of things in the air. So, it's a pretty simple signal to detect.\n\nPoint the radar at the ground, now it's bouncing off of... fuckin' EVERYTHING. Every tree, every bush, every rock, every building. Okay, so it bounces off of a plane flying near the ground too. What does that tell you, if you can't separate it from 1,000,000 other objects and the shape of the terrain itself?\n\nRadar kinda detects yes/no, it's not a fine art critique, can't identify the subtle changes of plane shape where there should be no plane shape.\n\nYou detect a triangle in the sky, you know that the sky doesn't have triangles. You detect a triangle on the ground, it could be fuckin' anything.",

There'll still be limits due to the curvature of the earth and a deep canyon will still be an issue.\n\nMilitary radar is also extremely sophisticated. Originally we helped combat interference from the ground with Doppler radar which would detect the speed of objects. So theoretically a house would be immobile and a jet would be traveling hundreds of mph.\n\nToday military radar is even more sophisticated. Machine learning can ID a radar return based on the shape of the object so even if you were above a highway traveling at highway speeds it could theoretically pick out the fingerprint of the object and recognize it separately from a semi truck because your aircraft tail will reflect microseconds before your wingtips etc. The radar return will be a little static-y blip which will change depending on your 3D shape.\n\nIt also can detect the signature of different jet engine turbines blades (Jet Engine Modulation/JEM) and helicopter rotors. So even if you flew a helicopter in traffic your rotors and jet turbine blades will both produce unique fingerprints distinguishing you from road traffic. \n\nThis is why people misunderstand why we're building next gen fighters. It really is a \"weapon system\" because sensors are so integral to the full system. Yes we could theoretically rip out old radars, IR sensors, computers, communication networks etc but usually by that point even your old fighter jet will now cost as much as a stealth fighter (or more as a retrofit). You really need to view an F35 as much an airborne radar system and computer network as an \"aircraft\".  \n\nHowever knowing \"you're there\" isn't necessarily enough. If you want to shoot this target down, your missile can't have nearly as powerful and sophisticated a radar system as your hundred million dollar fighter or airborne radar system. So one way that you try to shoot down a low flying aircraft in the ground clutter when the missile has limited radar is to piggy back off of the fighter (or airborne dedicated radar) signal via a digital uplink to provide course corrections or to directly piggy back by being keyed into detect the host fighters radar signals bouncing off the target.\n\nThe idea is that you can guide a missile to where the target is using very sophisticated radar on an aircraft and then only at the last moment detect the exact moment to detonate. But again, for every feature an adversary is working on a countermeasure. So even if you are highly confident of almost exactly where your target is, they can generate fake radar returns that are slightly delayed or so \"loud\" that it jams the missile's sensors.\n\nIf you're in the ground clutter the terminal radar of the missile itself may still be insufficiently precise, especially with electronic counter measures and jamming.\n\nSo even though modern radar may detect you, radar may guide a missile right to you... flying low can still help keep you alive. Which ultimately is what matters the most.\n\nThe same is true of stealth aircraft. We can now detect stealth aircraft somewhat reliably. But knowing they're there, and delivering a perfectly timed explosion to where you are exactly are two very different challenges.",

The thing is defense oriented facilities do have lower fire control radars that do look out to the horizon. So you would only be \"under the radar\" as long as the place is out of your own visual sight as well. So simply put, the scene in Top Gun maverick is not likely to play out in reality, just makes for some fun cinematography and fun at the movies. A real facility would have radars that looked other directions other than up and away.",

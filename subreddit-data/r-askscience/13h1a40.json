    "postText": "Typically when I find a bug in my home I pick it up and place it outside.  Problem is I'm moving soon to around the 50th floor of a building.  Can I safely toss a bug off my future balcony or will this mean certain death?  This question includes spiders that don't have wings.  I've done this with crickets from the 20th floor but some seemed to simply accept their fate and just drop straight to the ground which was not expected.  I do know small animals like mice have a terminal velocity that makes such falls non-fatal which is why I'm thinking it applies to most if not all bugs as well.",

A rat is killed, \na man is broken, a horse splashes. For the resistance presented to movement \nby the air is proportional to the surface of the moving object. Divide an \nanimal's length, breadth, and height each by ten; its weight is reduced to a \nthousandth, but its surface only to a hundredth. So the resistance to falling in \nthe case of the small animal is relatively ten times greater than the driving \nforce. \n\n&gt;An insect, therefore, is not afraid of gravity; it can fall without danger \u2026\n\n\u2014[On Being the Right Size](https://www.phys.ufl.edu/courses/phy3221/spring10/HaldaneRightSize.pdf), by [J.B.S.

Anyway, I suspect there might be some exceptions depending on the bug and the surface it lands on, but most of the time I would expect the bug to be just fine.  \n\nInteresting exception is big tarantulas.  They are big enough that falls can be very dangerous, since their exoskeletons are relatively weak compared to a similar sized vertebrate.",

            "comment": "Yeah, that bug will be fine.\n\nSo, whether an object is hurt by falling depends on its momentum when it hits the ground compared to its surface area.  You might be familiar with the square cube law, which essentially states that as something's volume increases, its surface area increases at a slower rate.  For each squared increase in surface area, the volume (and in this case, mass) increases by a cubic amount, so an object eight times the mass only has four times the surface area, etc.\n\nWhat this means for a fall is, a larger object's surface (you can imagine skin for the case of a human) has less strength to hold in its mass under an impact.\n\nBugs are small and not particularly dense, which means that even when they're falling very fast, they're not gonna hit the ground with much momentum.  They also have a hard exoskeleton, so it takes more force to injure, for example, a rhino beetle than a similarly-sized mouse.\n\nSo yeah, bugs are generally not going to be injured by a fall.",

            "comment": "Their terminal velocity (the fastest you can go while under the influence of air resistance) is much lower than yours and mine because they're much lighter and therefore they'll just fall slower and hit the ground with less momentum then get up like nothing happened. Meanwhile, you and I (both meat sacks thousands of times heavier than the bug) will end up looking like freshly squeezed toothpaste after a drop like that.",

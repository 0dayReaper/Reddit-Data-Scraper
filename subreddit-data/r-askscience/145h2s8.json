For the oldest known writing systems, there are some large discrepancies, e.g. the oldest Chinese script dated to ~1200 BCE while the oldest Sumerian script is dated to ~3400 BCE.\n\nIs there some way to predict missing predecessor writing systems by measuring the complexity of decipherable systems?  Working back from modern languages to ancient ones, can we trace a rough complexity curve back to the root of language?",

            "comment": "Not really, TBH. Writing systems don't necessarily change at any particular pace; especially since they're much more under the conscious control of their users than spoken language is. We can infer from the fact that the Chinese script and the Mayan script both are fully-functional linguistic writing systems from the earliest attestations that both were likely preceded by some kind of proto-writing system like the one we can watch Sumerian grow out of, but there's no way to know for sure how long that process was or even much about what it might have looked like. \n\nThat said, I think we can make some decent, if vague, educated guesses. Here's my understanding of what we know about the three-or-four instances of truly independent inventions of writing:\n\n* In the case of Sumerian, we can actually watch it develop out of a mnemonic system used for trade and taxation. The first attestations of this nonlinguistic system are from about 3300 BC, and the first real linguistic elements start appearing about four hundred years later. After that the forms of the letters slowly become more and more abstract, as medium-dependent ease-of-writing considerations start to become more important than the need to make the characters an obvious picture of anything.\n* Egyptian is a fully-formed linguistic writing system by about 2600 BC, though there are a few apparent uses of the system several hundred years before, so it's hard to put a clear date on the transition from mnemonics to real linguistic writing. It's not clear if Egyptian is an independent development or inspired by Sumerian; both develop around the same time. Egyptian gets its own schematic / simplified system (Hieratic) not much later than that 2600 BC date, but the system using very obvious pictures continues in use in formal contexts until the system finally stops being used entirely after the the Christianisation of the Roman Empire.\n* Chinese writing is only attested from the 1200s BC on discarded divinatory bones, but appears as a full linguistic system with no apparent predecessor nonlinguistic mnemonic system. However, we can infer from the character \u518a ('book, bound volume') that it was almost certainly written on other materials at the same time and before - the character appears in these oracle bone inscriptions, and is apparently a depiction of the kind of bound-bamboo-strip book known to have been used for centuries in China. So odds are it also had the same development process, but all of it happened on perishable material that's all gone now. The oracle bone script's characters are typically much less abstract than later Chinese script forms, suggesting that it possibly hadn't had all that much time to develop into more abstract and easier to write characters - it may have still been fairly new as a full linguistic system by that 1200s BC date.\n* Mayan also appears ex nihilo\u0301 as a fully functional linguistic system in stone inscriptions, potentially as early as the 300s BC. Again, it's entirely likely that it was used on perishable materials well before that - we still have a few Mayan bark-paper codices from later times. A few undeciphered inscriptions in [one or more possible related systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmian_script) have also been found with dates (written on them!) in the 1st or 2nd centuries AD, suggesting that the Mayan system or a predecessor had enough use on perishable materials to spawn other systems besides the surviving Mayan one, which were themselves used almost exclusively on perishable materials. Given that even by the 1500s the Mayan script hadn't been particularly simplified for ease of writing, it's nearly impossible to say how long it had developed beforehand.\n\n(Every other script in the world is likely descended from one of these four, if not by adoption-and-adaptation then at least by contact with a literate culture.)\n\nSo given that Sumerian took about half a millennium from first attestations to being a significantly linguistic system rather than just a pictographic mnemonic system, we can infer that these other systems probably also had at least a few centuries of use in such ways before their attestations on more durable media.",

It *seems* like writing, but there's so little material to go on it's hard to say for sure. I'd probably err on the side of 'potentially linguistic writing', but with a whole lot of caveats.\n\nThe 'Vin\u010da symbols' are probably one or more mnemonic systems, perhaps mixed with meaningless geometrical graffiti. Possibly the whole 'corpus' is meaningless geometrical graffiti, but I won't commit to that view.\n\n&gt; how would you define mnemonic vs fully linguistic\n\nA linguistic writing system encodes *the words a speaker would say*, while a mnemonic system encodes *enough information to recover meaning*. You can't read a mnemonic 'text' 'verbatim', because there's no words - you're creating a new sentence that conveys the same information the mnemonic 'text' records. You can read a linguistic text verbatim, because it encodes actual spoken language directly.\n\nIt's similar to the difference between reading a news article about a speech someone gave and simply listening to a recording of that speech. One conveys the information, the other conveys the speech itself directly.",

The word construction is also more contextual than with alphabetic languages.\n\nOr in your last example, it seems more about information fidelity.  How do we know that earlier mnemonics were more \"lossy\"?  Rather than us just not knowing how the rules work.",

So you have, for example, a drawing of a sitting person, a bull, and a number, which decipher to \"Enki has 5 cows\" for the person that wrote them. However, this is not functionally the same as linguistic writing saying \"Enki has 5 cows\", because someone looking at the mnemonic text 100 years later doesn't know that the sitting person was supposed to represent \"Enki\" instead of any other name, nor can they tell (without context clues) that the \"text\" is describing Enki owning 5 cows (as opposed to Enki owing someone a payment of 5 cows, or buying 5 new cows, or losing 5 cows, etc). So yeah, basically the difference between a mnemonic vs linguistic system is how precisely the author's exact words and meaning are conveyed.",

It's more that a mnemonic system contains markers that signify 'Enki', 'cow(s)', and 'five' arranged in a way that gives some information about the relationship between those concepts, while a linguistic system just writes the spoken words *Enki has five cows*, which you then understand because you understand the spoken language being written and how the writing system writes it.\n\nIn effect, a linguistic writing system is nearly an audio recording device - it just records exactly one kind of audio, and only through heavy reference to the internal structure of the system that produced the original audio stream, discarding information that isn't relevant to that structure.",

Cultures without agricultural-level quantities of crops or animals (especially large quantities changing hands often), or without very complex social structures with a whole lot of specialisation of labour, really don't need to keep track of stuff like that very much. Even modern cultures who have similar lifestyles often don't see much value in literacy - who needs to write anything when you can just remember it all?",

There are also non-agrarian cultures that used written language, although they may have adopted written language and agriculture multiple times. There's always  an assumption that everything is linear. There are cultures that subsist by hunting and gathering and others that rely on herding animals, but they almost certainly originated in agrarian cultures. Some indigenous peoples of North America were agrarian in warm seasons and nomadic hunter-gatherers in cooler seasons. There are many uses for written language that go beyond accounting for stored goods. However, I do agree that keeping track of stored goods is a great reason for adopting written communication strategies. In such a scenario you wouldn't want to use materials that survive thousands of years, you would want disposable or re-usable materials that don't fossilize well.",

But such animals were not used in that capacity before civilization.\n\n&gt; When humans first domesticated camels is disputed. Dromedaries may have first been domesticated by humans in Somalia or South Arabia sometime during the 3rd millennium BC, the Bactrian in central Asia around 2,500 BC,[18][77][78][79] as at Shar-i Sokhta (also known as the Burnt City), Iran.",

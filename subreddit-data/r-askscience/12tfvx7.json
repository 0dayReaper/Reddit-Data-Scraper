For example something that can be dealt with with simple surgery\n2. They delay treatment until after delivery\n3. They start treatment and either have an abortion or wait for miscarriage\n\nGenerally the cancer is no threat to the foetus but the treatments certainly are\n\nIn most cases it's a major blow to the woman and her partner and something for the ethical committee of the oncology department.",

And a lot of doctors won't have an issue with delivering a baby after 35 weeks. So it's more likely to be 7 months.\n\nStill a long time with cancer.",

            "comment": "There is an excellent answer already, but I wanted to clarify a more basic point that the foetus will not get cancer. Even if mother has cancer cells in her bloodstream, her cells do not directly go to the foetus. \n\nIn placenta, the blood of mother and baby come to opposite sides of a membrane, and the only things passing though are basic substances blocks like oxygen and amino acids, not entire cells. \n\nStill, the stress and disruption that cancer is putting on mother's body will have negative effects on the growing baby..",

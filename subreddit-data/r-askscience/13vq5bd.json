            "comment": "At room temperature and 1atm of pressure, [(most) cheese is a \"colloidal gel\" of water (liquid) in saturated fat (solid), held together by a network of proteins (solid)](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-science-of-melting-cheese). \n\nEDIT for clarity: a \"colloid\" in general is when you have small, insoluble bits of one thing suspended in another thing. In a \"colloidal emulsion\", both things are liquid, but in a \"colloidal gel\", you have [small bits of liquid suspended in a solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid#Classification_of_colloids).\n\nDrilling down, [that \"water\" is actually a liquid solution of water and water-soluble compounds](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/jf0258104): salts, amino acids, peptides, lactose, and more. And the \"fat\" is likewise a solid solution of fats and fat-soluble molecules, like the fat-soluble vitamins that cheese contains.\n\nSo cheese is a colloidal gel of a liquid water solution in a solid fat solution, held together by a solid network of proteins.",

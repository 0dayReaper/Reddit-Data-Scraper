The high cost of institutional licenses or large-scale purchasing of individual articles can be an overwhelming expense for new companies or smaller universities. Science relies upon the free flow of information and knowledge between persons and institutions around the world. Ending net neutrality puts that at risk.",

We the people have legalized it by ballot initiative. The relatively few decision-makers in state governments haven't legalized jack shit. ",

However, Congress could choose at any time to put net neutrality rules into law via regular legislation. Many people see congressional action as the ultimate and most likely endgame for this issue. That would be a good thing, though who knows if there will ever get around to doing it given everything else on Capitol Hill.",

They can insist that certain people be forced to pay extra for an essential service, just because they belong to a race or sex or religion that the dictator doesn't like. And even if the dictator himself doesn't care to do these things, he's *certainly* not about to stop his corporate cronies from doing so when it suits **their** purposes.\n\nIn more democratic nations, it's [usually](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis) not feasible to punish dissidents through their drinking water or their electricity. But corporate cronies will still go as far in that direction as they think they can get away with.\n\nIn 2005, employees of Canadian telecom company Telus went on strike. Telus responded by blocking **all** of its  4,000,000+ subcribers from accessing not only several pro-union websites, but over 700 unrelated websites that had the misfortune to be located on the same physical server as a pro-union website.\n\nThis is the sort of thing you would expect to happen in China or North Korea, not in a civilized nation that prides itself on caring about Human Rights. In 2005, however, the fact was that this was a legal grey area. The Canadian government immediately reacted to close this ridiculous loophole, and enacted strong Net Neutrality Laws. (These same laws have recently been strengthened again, in response to new anticompetitive \"Zero Rating\" schemes.)\n\nThis is the 21st century. Access to a free and unrestricted Internet may not be as fundamental on the Hierarchy of Needs as \"clean drinking water\", but it's already **far** more important than access to a landline phone, television set, or newspaper has *ever* been. The fact that most world governments still consider it a \"luxury\" while those things are considered \"essential services\" is testament only to the glacial speed of legislature, and the power of lobbyists to act against the best interests of the people.\n\nWhen ISPs are able to control what their users are allowed to say and what they're allowed to hear, they *can* and they *will* do this.\n\nAnd this is one of the many, MANY types of abusive behaviour which Ajit Pai and friends want to make **completely legal**. This isn't a paranoid fantasy of something that *might hypothetically happen*. It's something which *does happen* wherever and whenever it's possible for it to happen. This is in *addition* to things like restricting websites behind \"cable package\" style schemes, or throttling the bandwidth of any company that doesn't pay them protection money.\n\n\nCanada had its wake-up call in 2005. I *thought* that the USA had finally had its wakeup call in 2014 with the [Netflix Payola Scandal](https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/comcast-jumps-netflix-speed-rankings-payola-style-agreement/), but I guess underestimated the power of the lobbyists and the indifference of the voters.\n",

The ISP providers can make strategic alliances with some companies (by making them pay) to block access (or, more likely, slow to a point you won't be able to access it) to competitors. For example, the most easily possible imo is the Koch brothers might pay ISPs to make it hard to access any articles or information on climate change, or if someone wants to look up articles on it, they can mandate that the first articles that show up on search engines will be articles claiming there is no such thing as climate change or else that humans aren't responsible for it.\n\nIf it goes through there will definitely be resistance, but the companies that control stuff like search functions (like google) are corporations that are literally built to make money, and any stand they make will almost certainly be for that goal.\n\nMeanwhile, smaller companies (or universities) will be unable to pay the ISPs' fees and almost be inaccessible or if you try to access it it'll be either slow or low on the search rankings, and almost no one goes past the first page on google.",

The ISPs could block access to that new site from the US, or just charge a monthly fee to be able to get to it.  Now that new social network site has a *lot* harder time getting new users, and maybe fails or just never really takes off.

If Meo and nos and Vodafone decided to join in a council and simultaneously increase prices by 10 euros you couldn't do shit but pay more or have no internet. On their side that's just Comcast.

To be granted a license for your selected spectrum, you'll have to work with an FCC Frequency Coordinator in your area. Additionally, you'll need a network engineer (or two) who is familiar with routing protocols, and you'll need to work with a carrier (or two) to get your IP access. Who can offer your access will solely depend on where you're located and who's built fiber in that area.\n\nYou'll need to plan your delivery methods, and how customers will connect. You'll need to find CPE (Customer premise equipment) that will work with your delivery method, and then work with a Security Engineer to bolt down communications so that they don't expose your infrastructure or other customers. \n\nFor the transmission towers, you'll probably need to lease space from existing tower owners. If you're just trying to toss a tower up on your roof, you'll need to understand how high it will need to be to gain LOS to other nodes (or customers). The height and installation allowances are regulated by local and federal laws. \n\nTo provide reliable service, you'll need to look into diverse and redundant fiber runs and the equipment to support it.\n\nLike sure, you could go stand up a pole in your backyard with a WiFi antenna on it, but, uh, that won't make you an ISP. (However, it'll make you a great target for lightning!)\n\nOh by the way, you'll need to have spare hardware on hand for when the live tower gear eventually gets hit by lightning.\n\nThere's probably about 10,000 other things that I'm overlooking, but that's the gist of it.",

That is what we are fighting to protect. The disadvantages are that small ISPs cannot compete because it is too expensive to start an ISP, and many that do get bought out by larger companies. The FCC is trying to use the disadvantages as an excuse to repeal Title II. \n\nHowever, their actual intention is to get rid of the advantages of Title II, so they can charge people extra, throttle internet speeds, and restrict access to websites.\n\nIn reality, if Title II is repealed, net neutrality would be gone forever because there is no way they would allow it back in as a regulation. As for small ISPs and the competitive market, those changes can be made without having to repeal Title II. The FCC just wants you to think that they are trying to have a more competitive ISP market.\n\nIn the long run, it is better to keep Title II and start forming bill without the major regulations that do not allow competition in the market. Doing this will allow us to keep net neutrality and allow more competition in the ISP market.\n\nIf the FCC wins, then net neutrality is gone forever, and the major regulations that affected small ISPs would't matter either way because big ISPs would still find a way to prevent new ISPs from growing.\n\nBasically, if you support the FCC repeal; then, you pretty much support monopolies.",

My reasoning specifically revolves around why we grant only a certain number of telephone companies the ability to run cables -- there is only so much room on a poll or in a conduit.\n\nThe parts of Verizon, AT&amp;T, &amp;c that operate the copper networks may not be the most profitable business in the world, but they're not hurting for cash either. I'm OK with this.\n\nPOTS (Plain Old Telephone System) providers are free to charge extra for features such as voicemail, call waiting, &amp;c However, to my knowledge, they cannot prevent you from calling a customer on another network. (With long-distance calls, I'm not 100% sure, but I believe that domestically it is/was flat rate and not based on the provider of the person you were calling.)\n\nSo, in the end, I would actually like to go a step further and make ISPs proper utilities, not the in-between they are now.\n\nMoreover, there were government initiatives that got or otherwise subsidized phones out into the rural areas where providers were less inclined to go. I'm also OK with this, especially since it happened mainly when owning a telephone transition from a luxury to being almost-essential to be part of society, much like the internet is becoming now.\n\nMoreover, I don't believe that competition is actually the problem.  Nothing short of anti-trust rules (which obviously havn't come into play) would prevent larger player from gobbling up smaller ones, one way or another (e.g. m&amp;a or taking a loss to drive the competition out of business). And even assuming 100% honest and ethical players, not ever place will be awash in competition.\n\nI don't think that the idea that ISPs cannot artificially prevent you from making a connection or throttling you before you've used your bandwidth allocation* is too much to ask. They aren't prevented from bandwidth-based tiers. They aren't prevented from running their own services. In fact, under NN, they aren't even prevented from making better connections with certain providers. (i.e. I think the issues with peering between Verizon (iirc) and Netflix is shady, I don't think it should actually be _illegal_.  Outright traffic shaping should be, but declining to mutually upgrade interconnect infrastructure should not be (even if it literally means plugging in a few more cables)).\n\n\\* Bandwidth is the item that is physically limited.  Data caps are not a useful tool because they do not address the central issue of congestion.  ISPs should sell 95%ile bandwidth just like data centers do. Stop advertising the \"world's fastest internet\" and tell me what you'll guarantee me in terms of bandwidth and at what price.",

The free enterprise system is being taken advantage of because there are no checks and balances, which is why we don't have many options, even though we are given that illusion.\n\nSo, the issue right now, today, is that there are regulations and policies to allow ISPs to be \"monopolies\" or \"duopoly\" at best, but we don't regulate them like we do water, electric, &amp;c.\n\nI would agree 100% with figuring out how we are going to treat them.  As you describe, this in-between assignment is not good for the public at large.\n\nThey should be no-one special and required to finish the projects they received government funds to create and the protections we've built for them removed. (For instance, some states prevent municipal ISPs. In many/most municipalities, there are franchise agreements that all but promise a monopoly or duopoly.)\n\nOr they should be granted a monopoly and regulated as a public utility like phones, electricity, natural gas, water, and sewers are.\n\nI actually think the second is a better solution as even with the protections removed, the start up costs are gigantic and most people would be left in a monopoly or duopoly for a very long time.",

A company will send out a rep to \"oversee\" the installation process by essentially causing delays which will be costly to the startup. It's essentially why Google Fiber has had such difficulty. If it can happen to Google then imagine that process on a small startup ISP.\n\n\nAgain, I'm paraphrasing. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Soon, Amazon and Hulu make the same deal with Comcast. Internet bills drop or stay the same, viewership among the streaming giants shoots up, and Comcast is raking it in. Everyone is happy.\n\nExcept Sarah! Sarah just started a streaming company with a recommender system that blows everyone else out of the water. She's struggling to get any traction and when she asks users what they think, the feedback is always that it's way better than Netflix but it's just *so slow*. This is, of course, because Sarah's company doesn't get the all-4k-all-the-time treatment everyone else gets because her small operation can't afford the $1M/month price tag.\n\nThe takeaway is that the important part isn't the internet, it's the things that get *made* on the internet. The internet might be the largest driver of entrepreneurship in history, and part of that is the low barrier to entry. Without an unbiased internet, the barrier to entry rises, which stifles competition, which hurts everyone.",

I keep hearing all these horrendous Doomsday scenarios about what's going to happen if Net Neutrality is rolled back, but.. wouldn't the practical and only real imminent effect of repealing Net Neutrality is that the laws pertaining to net neutrality and the way the web and ISPs operate in the U.S. would simply go back to how it was in 2014? (and I don't remember any apocalypse happening in 2014 or the years before it as it is being described all over the web in regard to Net Neutrality being repealed) Hopefully someone can clarify, and tell me if I missed something here.",

Smaller ISPs can turn around and sell their service as not having throttling at a similar price point or less than Big Cable? \n\nSimilar to a T-Mobile effect.  They were a small company trying to fight VZW, Sprint, ATT and the likes by offering unlimited everything before it was the cool thing to do.  Now look at them.  They've become one of the top players in the market and have the financial means to continue improving their system.  Ultimately leading us to getting the same, if not more, for potentially less. \n\nThat scenario also then could force Large ISPs hands to cave and limit or remove throttling.\n\nJust a thought. \n\nAgain, I do not want to see net neutrality end and am fearful about what the internet will look like in the coming months and years.

If an ISP decides to give you a basic internet package with Google and some other basic needs websites, say, for 20$ a month, and that's all you can afford, what are you gonna do? Switch providers? MANY people cannot do that due to ISPs not allowing others to use the same lines that they laid previously. So say you live somewhere you only have access to Comcast, and you're a poor college student. You need access to certain research websites or stuff of that nature for school, but they're only included in the \"deluxe\" package for 60$ a month. You're basically forced to suck it up and take it. Meanwhile, even when these ISPs allow you access, they may throttle your bandwidth for websites that compete against others they own. So, if you own a large share in Hulu, you may give someone direct access with very quick speeds to the Hulu website. Unfortunately, they've throttled your access to Netflix to the point that you can't really stream any sort of content reliably. The idea behind net neutrality is having the Internet as a utility, not something you can charge whatever you want to for access. ",

Whatever the internet provider wants to do, will be done and there will be no government regulation to prevent it. Basically this means that your ISP can even favor Bing over Google and make Bing free to use and Google to be completely unavailable or make you pay like $10 a month if you want to use Google. This kind of market will be susceptible to deals between the websites (like Microsoft pays Comcast to disable/make Google' services much slower).",

The reality is that net neutrality is the corporate position. These stunts, like any marketing campaign, cost money. One of the people responsible for these stunts is George Soros. If you're not read up on him, he's the human garbage known for rigging elections, subverting American sovereignty, generating unreal amount of propaganda, funding domestic terrorism and extremism and manipulating currencies to amass even more wealth. Two of his foundations, the Ford Foundation and Open Society Foundation, have contributed at least $200m to net neutrality groups. $200m will buy a lot of henchmen and go a long way in framing an issue as if there is only one side to it. Personally, I am suspicious of anything this guy supports since he seems like the closest real example of literary evil.\n\nHere's an alternative way to frame the issue. The current legislation is terrible. Government regulation is being heavy handed as usual. Since being enacted it has disincentivized ISPs from performing upgrades or expansions according to [22 small ISPs](https://www.publicknowledge.org/assets/uploads/documents/170425_Letter_from_22_Small_ISPs.pdf). (Ironically, when searching for this document I had to go through one of open society's child websites for them to tell me that the small ISPs are lying.) 2010-2015 estimates put it at between $80b-$125b in lost infrastructure investments. The wireless industry saw a $6b drop in expected revenue (-20%). Actual loss far outweighs the hysterical and nonsensical claims by those pushing net neutrality.",

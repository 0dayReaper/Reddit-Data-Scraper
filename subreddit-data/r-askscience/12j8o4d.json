They calculate jupiter at 338 times the mass of earth when today we believe 317.*  They also thought its size was 1400 times earths, today we say greater than 1300.*  They dont mention what the think it is made of but I think they could deduce it was not like earth.  Google give the answer as in 1930s the gas giant proposal was put forth.  But I have no supporting proof.\n\n*Chamber's encyclopedia , 1887",

You can be fairly certain that you're looking at the surface.  Now, you look at Jupiter.  You notice that different parts of it rotate at different speeds.  So you know you're looking at a cloud layer.  So that means that the surface has to be underneath it, and is thus smaller than the observed size of Jupiter.  How much smaller is the question.",

If we take one moon, and we can calculate the semi-major axis of its orbit, and how long it takes to complete an orbit (its period), Kepler's 3rd law allows us to relate an Orbit's period, semi-major axis, and the mass of the larger, Central body.\n\nMeasuring the period of an orbit is reasonably easy just through observation. To measure the semi-major axis is more challenging. It's a little complicated to get into in a brief comment, but if you're interested, there are techniques like trigonometric parallax that helps you determine the distance to Jupiter, and then some simpler trigonometry to work the distance from Jupiter to its moons.\n\nOnce we have the orbital parameters, we use Kepler's 3rd law to find the mass of jupiter.\n\nCalculating its size comes from knowing the distance between Earth and Jupiter and comparing that to it's angular size, and again using trigonometry to work out its diameter.\n\nAll you need are precise enough measurements of which good enough equipment was being developed in early modern europe, but the maths is thousands of years old.\n\nEdit: as another comment pointed out, there is a similar but far easier method where you can just use the angular measurements. \n\nStarting from Kepler's 3rd law: T^(2)=4pi^(2)a^(3)/GM\n\nKnowing that M = rho*volume and using the volume for a sphere. Rearranging for rho you get: rho =3pi/GT^(2) * (a/r)^3\n\nA is the semi major axis of a moon's orbit, T is its period, and r is Jupiter's radius. But as this involves just a ratio of lengths, similar triangles allows us to relate this to angular distance.\n\nFantastic! So you just need the angular measurements and the period of the orbit and you can work out the density!",

The moons experience eclipses about a thousand times a year; by observing a particular eclipse from somewhere in the world and comparing the time it occurs with its predicted time in Greenwich (available in a book published regularly by British astronomers expressly for this purpose), the location's longitude could be calculated very precisely.\n\nThis led to a very noticeable evolutionary leap in the accuracy of maps published from that time onwards. The technique of measuring Jovian eclipses was really only possible on land (although some ingenious attempts to observe these at sea were made); accurate *navigation* by ships required the invention of precise seagoing clocks a century later.",

Mechanical clocks of that era were sufficiently accurate to only gain/lose a few seconds a day, which was enough to tell you the current time if you could accurately gauge when high noon was (which you can easily do via shadow lengths when the sun is out). They just weren't accurate enough to reliably keep Greenwich time over the course of the weeks or months of a sea journey, and thus weren't accurate enough to determine longitude.\n\n&gt; knowing the exact location wasn't possible\n\nKnowing the exact location requires calculating latitude and longitude. Latitude had for centuries been easy to measure with a sextant; calculating longitude required the Jovian technique I described, or later required super-accurate timepieces, or even much later required a GPS device.",

You only need the angle of Jupiter in the sky (obviously, otherwise its volume is unconstrained), the angle between Jupiter and a moon at its largest separation, the orbital period and the gravitational constant\n\nConsider a random distance value. If Jupiter is twice as far but all angles stay the same then the moons have twice the acceleration at twice the distance, which means Jupiter's mass is 2\\*2^2 = 8 times as large. The same also applies to its volume, so the density is the same anyway.\n\nExpressed differently, the average density of an object determines the orbital period at a given multiple of the radius (including 1, i.e. orbiting just above the surface).",

Other than that, yes. \n\nAlso, using the work of Galileo and Kepler they could only give the mass of Jupiter as a multiple of Earth's, not in a regular unit like pounds. It wasn't until Cavendish's work on measuring gravity in 1798 that they could put a value to it in regular units.",

Imagine that you were standing with two boxes in front of you; one 1 meter away, the other 100 meters away. If you take 1 step to the left, the closest box looks like it has moved a lot further than the more distant box. This is parallax.\n\nBy quantifying this parallax, and knowing how much distance there is in your step, you can determine the distance to far away objects.\n\nSo, you in London take measurements of where Jupiter is in the sky. You ask a colleague in Fez to do the same thing at roughly the same time. With enough precision in your measurements, and knowing the distance between you and your colleague, you can figure out the parallax of Jupiter, and hence determine it's distance from you.",

A planet's orbital speed is basically a function of its distance from the sun and the eccentricity of its orbit. It has nothing to do with the planet's mass. \n\nMy guess is that they could estimate the mass of Saturn and Jupiter from the orbits of their moons. I suppose you could also see its effects on nearby celestial objects like comets and asteroids, but its unlikely they had much of this kind of data.",

Mass is determined by orbital periods of gravitationally coupled objects, and volume is determined by apparent angle and distance.\n\nWe now believe that the outer layers are gas and the rest is a hot, dense, super critical [fluid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallic_hydrogen) that dissolves any matter like asteroids and planets that fall into it, and depositing the remnants onto the surface of a solid core.

In this instance, though, the document dates from after the period of uncertainty so does not answer the primary question unless it gives a historical overview, which I am going to try to expand from memory below. Might be some errors in detail. \n\nThe issue is more a 1700s-era (18th century, and earlier too) questioning, the proto-science or naturalism period when people were looking and observing and actually thinking about the new info and what it all meant, and actually saying that the received knowledge (mostly the bible or the ancient greeks) was not correct, did not fit with what we can see (not a trivial thing when arguing against the bible could result in capital punishment).\n\nThe first step, of course, was to even imagine that planets were planets instead of some sort of moving lights in the sky.  We give credit for that to Galileo.  Kepler figured out the orbital behavior.  Playing with Newtonian ideas of gravity led to the demonstration of the existence of lower density (gaseous) planets.  (Jupiter, at least, was already thought of as gaseous just because of its appearance but it wasn't proven).\n\nWe have to remember that optics of old time telescopes were not the best so it was not easy to see the planets and discern there superficial appearances in detail, yet even Galileo thought that Jupiter was covered by an opaque atmosphere (was \"gaseous\"). Mars, sure, we could see the ground and even had decent maps of the surface by the late 1800s, but no solid surface was ever visible with Jupiter.\n\nThey kept working on it (thinking evolved as more and more people reported what they saw) and came to the idea that some planets were really rocky (high density like earth, and the moon which we can see really well) and some were low density, so gaseous more than rocky (like Jupiter). Outer planets=gaseous, inner planets=rocky.  This was all pretty well accepted by the late 1800s.\n\nModern (space age) studies have added loads and loads of details about the different planets.  Still learning new things though.",

            "comment": "The gas giants were all Earth sized terrestrial (rocky) planets at one point and they actually gained most of their mass in an incredibly short period of time (in terms of galactic or even evolutionary timescales).\n\nBillions of years ago, when the planets formed, there was what is known as a protoplanetary nebula around the Sun - basically a big puffy pancake of gas (mostly hydrogen but also helium, oxygen, nitrogen, oxygen etc) and dust (pretty much everything else). There is way more gas than dust though.\n\nThe dust clumped together, first into small lumps similar to how you get dust balls under a bed, then by bumping and sticking into each other, bigger and bigger until these lumps were the size of busses. Some of these lumps would then get 'ahead of the game' by pure chance and would dominate their local areas, growing up to about the size of the moon or Mars. These big bodies are known as \"protoplanets\" while the smaller ones are known as \"planetesimals\".\n\nThe protoplanets are then bombarded by the planetesimals over millions of years, the smaller lumps getting caught by the gravitational pull of the larger bodies, pulling them in. Some protoplanets crash into each other too. This is how planets form and for rocky planets like the Earth, this is pretty much it.\n\nHowever, remember that I said the protoplanetary nebula also had loads of gas in it too? Well all this planetary growth is going on in the middle of all this gas. It doesn't really do too much to the smaller lumps although the bigger protoplanets are, the more it drags them around in the disc. The larger protoplanets will be able to capture some of this gas, this is largely how planets get their atmospheres.\nMost planets don't manage to capture much of this gas before it disappears though (it only sticks around for a few million years before he heat from the Sun basically evaporates it away into surrounding space). However, some planets manage to get big enough that the way they can capture gas goes wild - they kind of get big enough that they grow faster, which makes them bigger which makes them grow even faster etc etc - it's called runaway growth. This happens when a planet is about 5-10 times the mass of the Earth. Note this can only happen if there is enough gas left in the disc, which is why rocky 'Super Earths' are discovered quite a lot by astronomers.\n\nThe planets that do manage to do this manage to soak up all the gas in their region of the disc and in doing so, become gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. Others that start a bit late or start too far out in the disc where the gas is sparser become 'ice giants' like Uranus and Neptune.\n\nAs to when this all happened, well we're talking about 4.54 billions years ago as that's when the Earth was formed and as I said, this runaway growth phase for the gas giants lasted at most a couple of million years so, that also happened about 4.54 billion years ago. I think the error range for when the Earth was formed is about 1%, which is about 45 million years, so the runaway growth period lasted for the blink of the eye as far as the solar system is concerned!\n\nSource: My PhD thesis was in gas giant formation. Over a decade ago now though. :)\n\nEdit: Fixed a typo.",

Terrestrial sized planets would have likely started a bit further out and migrated inwards a bit due to the drag of the disk but not by a huge amount, however the gas giants are likely to have moved a lot. This was the area where I was working in as there are various types of ways that a planet within a gas disc can move - known as type I or type II migration. Basically, one form is where they're small enough to be dragged around by the gas disc and the other is where they can carve out a gap in the disc at which point they move only a little. Type 1 is *fast* and usually moves only inwards (although models we were working on incorporated other factors that allowed for both inward and outward migration based on the local structure of the disc). By the time they enter type 2, they basically need to have accreted most of their mass. Gas giants likely accreted almost all of their mass within a timeframe of only hundreds, if not tens, of thousands of years.",

It wasn\u2019t until the early 20th century when Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin invented astronomical spectroscopy and was able to prove that the sun was mostly hydrogen and helium, and it took years for this to be believed because the mainstream view found it so ridiculous.\n\nOnce it was accepted her discovery was largely forgotten by history and credit was given to men who had initially opposed her work instead.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Payne-Gaposchkin\n\nEdit: personally I think this history should be mentioned in high school science classes, similar to how the history of the atomic models are covered at that level.

            "comment": "According to the Wikipedia article on gas giants, the term was coined in 1952 by the science fiction writer James Blish and was originally used to refer to all giant planets. However, it is somewhat misleading because most of the matter in these planets is not in gaseous form, but rather in a supercritical fluid state due to the high pressure and temperature. \r  \n\rThe gas giants in our solar system, Jupiter and Saturn, are composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, with a small fraction of heavier elements. They are thought to have a solid core surrounded by layers of metallic and molecular hydrogen, and an outer atmosphere with visible clouds of water and ammonia. \r  \n\rThe gas giants were not always known to be gaseous. In fact, before the invention of telescopes, they were considered to be stars because they were bright and moved across the sky. The first observations of Jupiter's moons by Galileo in 1610 proved that it was a planet and not a star. \r  \n\rThe first evidence that Jupiter and Saturn had thick atmospheres came from spectroscopic observations in the 19th and early 20th centuries, which revealed absorption lines of hydrogen, helium, methane, ammonia and other gases. \r  \n\rHowever, the exact structure and composition of the gas giants remained uncertain until the space probes Pioneer 10 and 11 flew by Jupiter and Saturn in the 1970s, followed by Voyager 1 and 2 in the late 1970s and early 1980s. These missions provided detailed images and measurements of the planets' atmospheres, magnetic fields, rings, moons and internal structure. \r  \n\rSo, to answer your question, the gas giants were originally thought to be terrestrial like Earth until the 17th century, when they were recognized as planets. They were known to be gaseous by the early 20th century, based on spectroscopic observations. Their internal structure and composition were revealed by space probes in the late 20th century.",

The French astronomer Pierre-Simon Laplace first proposed the idea that there were giant planets made primarily of gas in the late 18th century. Laplace suggested that these gas giants were formed from the gas and dust left over after the formation of the Sun and that their large size was because they had accreted a lot of this material.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, it was not until the development of telescopes and other astronomical observation techniques in the 20th century that scientists could study the gas giants in more detail and confirm that they were indeed made primarily of gas. The first detailed observations of the gas giants were made by the Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 spacecraft in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which provided detailed images and data about the planets' atmospheres, structures, and compositions.\r  \n\r  \nToday, scientists believe that the gas giants - Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune - are composed mostly of hydrogen and helium gas, with smaller amounts of other gases and rocky materials in their cores. Their atmospheres are characterized by colorful cloud bands, swirling storms, and other dynamic weather patterns.",

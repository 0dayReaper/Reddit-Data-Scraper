            "comment": "For this; (1) lets assume we're interested in trying to harness wind energy from tornadoes specifically as opposed to targeting the storms that generate tornadoes as a whole and (2) we'll skip over the (large) engineering challenges of building a turbine that would not only survive a tornado, but actually be able to continue to function during one and generate more power as wind speed increases. Toward that last point, we're skipping over what the actual power curve of turbines look like (e.g., [the discussion and graph on this page](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/how-do-wind-turbines-survive-severe-storms)). Specifically that as wind speed increases, power output increases up to a point until it reaches its \"rated speed\", basically the wind speed and power generation the turbine can generate power and not damage itself, and power generation stays constant until it hits the \"cut-off speed\", basically the wind speed where the turbine would be damaged if it kept generating power. \n\nFrom above, for our hypothetical \"tornado turbine\" to be useful, it would need to either have a *very large* rated and/or cut-off speed and ideally  have a somewhat monotonic wind speed to power generated curve, i.e., we always get more power for higher wind speeds (for the purposes of this question, through *magic* as far as we're concerned). However, even if we assume that was possible, it quickly becomes apparent that we'd have to build *lots* of these turbines and that virtually all of them would never actually encounter a tornado. For this, we can consider a map of [tornado tracks in the US from 1950-2022](https://mrcc.purdue.edu/gismaps/cntytorn.htm#). What should be apparent here is that yes, there are lots of tornadoes, but importantly, if we think about placement of a turbine in a specific location (and considering that tornadoes generally have pretty small footprints), there are *very few* places we could put one that during this 70 year period would even encounter one tornado, let alone encountering even 2-3. \n\nConsidering all that, we can see that the better strategy is to just build turbines where we tend to have high average wind speeds (which is broadly what has been done in the US, e.g., [the map on this page](https://www.energy.gov/eere/articles/wind-turbines-bigger-better)). There is definitely already some decent overlap in terms of where we build turbines and where there are relatively high densities of tornadoes, but going through the hassle of trying to engineer a turbine to usefully extract wind energy from a tornado is not likely to be worth it given the low probability (both in time and space) that our hypothetical turbine would ever be in the right place to interact with a tornado.\n\n**TL;DR** ignoring the engineering challenges of making a turbine that wouldn't break itself during extreme winds, the probability that any fixed spot will experience a tornado during the lifetime of a turbine is exceedingly low.",

And they're so impressive that they are super turbines combined with earlier generations. And future generations will be super turbines compared to today's.\n\nA tornado is going to break things, not be useful power. We protect turbines from that scale wind.\n\nAnd there's no need. There's an absurd amount of wind energy available, we just need to build and run hvdc transmission lines to ship the power around. We don't need to chase technically infeasible mega projects.",

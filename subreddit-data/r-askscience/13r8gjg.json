    "postText": "Will the offspring have either their father or mothers nose? Why do certain people seem like they have a mix between the two? Because one of their relatives has their nose (gma, gpa)? It isn\u2019t literally a mix of the two noses right? I apologize if this seems silly. Does the same go for eye color? If a blue eyed person and brown eyed person reproduce, if their child doesn\u2019t have either blue or brown, it isn\u2019t a true mix of blue and brown, but just the eye color of a relative?",

            "comment": "So the specific example of noses may seem frivolous, but the overall question is actually fundamental for lots of questions, and deeply puzzled some very smart people 150 years ago.\n\nThe question describes what *seems* to be two different kinds of inheritance. One (eye color) is the relatively familiar Mendelian inheritance we learned in grade 8. (I know it's not truly Mendelian inheritance, most things are not when you look carefully, but it's close enough.) With Mendelian inheritance -- oversimplified as aways -- there is a \"gene\" for A, which can manifest in two different forms -- wrinkled or smooth peas; blue or brown eyes -- and the offspring end up with one of those two options. \n\nBut that's not how most inheritance works. A tall mother and a small father don't end up with kids who are either tall or small; their children may be in between, with a wide range of heights (and not unusually, some may be taller than the tall parent, or smaller than the small one). If one parent has a big nose and the other has a small one, the kids may have noses that are moderate sized. This *looks like* blending inheritance.  \n\n&gt;Blending inheritance is an obsolete theory in biology from the 19th century. The theory is that the progeny inherits any characteristic as the average of the parents' values of that characteristic. As an example of this, a crossing of a red flower variety with a white variety of the same species would yield pink-flowered offspring.\n\n--[Blending inheritance on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blending_inheritance)\n\nWhy is this important? It's important because evolution through natural selection *doesn't work* if blending inheritance is true. (Darwin knew this, spent a lot of time trying to come up with explanations, and never succeeded fully. A prediction of his theory was therefore that blending inheritance was false, which Mendel had already demonstrated though Darwin didn't know it.)\n\nIn fact, \"Mendelian inheritance\" and \"blending inheritance\" look the same in the first generation *if there are enough genes involved*.  If there's only one gene that contributes to height, then \"tall\" and \"small\" are really the only options. If there are two, then tall, small, and medium may be options. If there are ten, then there may be 2^10 = 1000 options. If 100 genes contribute to height, the output in the first generation of an all-tall and all-small cross should be a smooth, normal distribution of heights. And crucially, all the genes are still present, and the subsequent generations can re-assemble the original phenotype as well as new variations, even without new mutations (which Darwin also didn't know about, of course).  \n\nSo the key to this question is that most interesting aspects of an individual aren't \"caused\" by one or two genes. The media often talk about \"the gene for\" violence, or disease resistance, or height, or whatever. That's nonsense. Most of these things are \"caused\" by hundreds or thousands of genes, each contributing a fraction of a percent to the phenotype. Tall people don't have \"the gene\" for height, they have maybe a hundred of the thousand genes that tend towards height (to say nothing of environmental influences). \n\nSimple, one- or two-gene aspects do exist, but they're really unusual. Once you think about things as the product of hundreds of interactions, a lot of inheritance becomes more clear. (Of course, if makes it much harder to track does disease-protective genes and so on.)",

            "comment": "Like many characteristics, nose size and shape are controlled by many genes, each with multiple alleles. \nFor example, nose shape was found to be influenced by a handful of genes. Overall, two genes, GLI3 and PAX1, were linked to nostril breadth, while a gene called RUNX2 affected the width of the nose bridge. So, the appearance of a child is generally not predictable.",

            "comment": "There is a very long explanation and a short one. The long one is above, the short one is: \n\nSome characteristics are influenced by one gene which is expressed by the dominant one in the pair, other ones are influenced by many genes and/or environment therefore it creates a spectrum of what can be. Also, genes work by pair, parents give only half each, some are dominant, other are not.\n\nA parent could have blue and brown eye gene, if the other also has this, the pair can give either. \n\nA parent could have 3 genes for big nose and 3 other for small nose. 2 big, one small are given with 2 small one big and there you have a mix.",

            "comment": "In genetics, we call this trait as inheritance. Many appearance characteristics of parents will be inherited to offspring, i. e. skin color, height, eyes, nose, ears, etc. Large nose, wide nose and high nose are dominant inheritance. Therefore, as long as one of the parents has a big nose, the child is more likely to inherit is. The inheritance of eye color is much more complex, but in generally, it follows the principle of 'dark colors are dominantly inherited compared to lighter color'.",

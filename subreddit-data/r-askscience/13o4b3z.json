            "comment": "In the early 1900s, our understanding of nutrition basically boiled down to \"food is fuel\". Whatever food you ate, as long as it had protein, carbohydrates, and fat, your body would turn those three into either energy or raw materials for making whatever it needed. As long as you had an optimal balance of those three, *nothing* else in the diet was needed.\n\nBut there were a few unexplained diseases\u2014beri beri and scurvy, as two examples\u2014that weirdly seemed to have something to do with diet. They knew, for example, that if you lived off white rice alone for 8 or 9 months, you could develop beri beri...but if you ate meat, or left the pericarp on the rice, that same beri beri could be cured. If you fed cows a \"bare minimum\" diet of pure protein, fat, and carbohydrates, they would go blind and their growth would be stunted. Scientists worked to figure out why these things were, but really didn't know what to make of this, and some of their hypotheses were *wild*...\n\n...but eventually, several scientists figured out that these diseases were caused by a lack of something in the diet. Elmer McCollum and Marguerite Davis isolated a chemical \"factor A\" that rats and cows needed to avoid becoming blind and having their growth stunted. Polish biochemist Casimir Funk identified a separate [\"vital amine\"](https://www.mv.helsinki.fi/home/hemila/history/Funk_1912.pdf) that the body needed to stave off beri beri. Funk specifically figured out that these \"vital amines\" (or vitamins, as we now call them) were chemical compounds that the body *needed,* but could not *manufacture*...something other than fat, protein, and carbohydrates.\n\nSo, in general, the small number of compounds we call \"vitamins\" today were only called \"vitamins\" because the body either could not manufacture them at all, or could not always manufacture enough of them. Vitamin D is a little special in that we *can* synthesize it, but modern humans that don't get enough sunlight often *don't* synthesize enough of it.\n\nAnd so, in answer to your question...for *most* compounds that we call vitamins, we cannot manufacture them, no. And it's only *because* we can't manufacture most of them that we call them \"vitamins\" in the first place.",

Modern amenities such as clothing, buildings, and sunscreen all limit our UV exposure, which lowers skin cancer rates but also reduces our ability to synthesize vitamin D.",

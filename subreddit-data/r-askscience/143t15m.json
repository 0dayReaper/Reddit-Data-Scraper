            "comment": "Different species seem to have different \"target systems\" for allergic responses. Dogs are skin&gt;GI, cats are lungs&gt;skin, horses are lungs. Outside of those species, allergies are fairly rare or rarely recognized.\n\nIn dogs, many allergies can be managed through diet, as that seems to be how many of their allergic responses arise (even those appearing as skin symptoms). Cats are commonly environmental sources (pollens, molds, etc.), as are horses.",

            "comment": "Vet tech here. I\u2019ve worked with dogs, cats, &amp; horses. \n\nMost common allergy in dogs is seasonal allergies. Affecting the skin, ears, &amp; eyes. Not as common but they will also get food allergies. It\u2019s generally the protein that they are allergic to. Chicken, beef, &amp; lamb are the 3 proteins that are the usually the culprit. These allergies will affect the GI system &amp; the skin. Dogs will also get atopic &amp; contact dermatitis that also affects the skin. Dogs can also get vaccine reactions. Causing lethargy, loss of appetite, swelling, vomiting. \n\nCats generally will get atopic dermatitis, flea/insect allergies, &amp; contact dermatitis. These will usually affect the skin, eyes, &amp; respiratory system. Cats also have vaccine reactions. Causing about the same reactions in dogs. But cats can get FISS. Feline injection-site sarcoma. This is a very rare type of cancer. This is why we vaccinate cats as low on their shoulder &amp; flank as possible. So on the, again, rare occasion they do develop this cancer, less leg needs to be amputated. \n\nI actually own a horse with seasonal allergies. Seasonal allergies in horses mostly affects the respiratory system, skin, &amp; eyes. Horses also will get vaccine reactions as well. Causing swelling, soreness, loss of appetite, fever, colic, anaphylaxis, etc. A severe vaccine reaction will sometimes last several days. \n\nI do want to mention, VACCINATE YOUR ANIMALS. These are risks that we are required to go over for client education. Vaccinating your animals is extremely important for the health of your pet, other people\u2019s pets, &amp; people. There are diseases that are zoonotic (transmissible to humans. Such as Leptospirosis). Vaccine reactions are managed by pre-treating with oral or injectable medications by your vet. \n\nLastly, just like people, animals can be allergic to almost anything at any point in their lives. They can also change over time too. Every animal is different so symptoms can manifest differently too. Certain breeds are more prone to allergies too. Frenchies, golden retrievers, labs, Yorkies are some examples that are more prone to skin allergies. Chestnut horses tend to have more sensitive skin too. Allergies can scary &amp; annoying for both pets &amp; humans but they can be managed. \n\nEdit: Just cleaned up some redundancies in my post :)",

A couple times a year our massive oak trees dump massive layers of yellow pollen all over. He would scratch himself like crazy, sneeze, get crusty eyes, etc. He was a community cat, so we couldn't just bring him in or give him so benadryl. Poor bastard. \n\nI've also known dogs to be allergic, too.",

    "postText": "&gt;Wheeler,(1958). Scientific Glassblowing, Interscience Publishers, New York &amp; London. Chapter IV Basic Operations, Page 56. \"Milligan has found that the strength of glass containing cracks is greatly influenced by a liquid in contact with the surface of the glass. Exposure of the surface to air saturated with alcohol or water greatly reduces the strength. Putting a drop of water on the crack reduces the strength by about 20% whereas moistening the crack with dry paraffin oil strengthens the tube by about 20%. Milligan does not advance an explanation for either of these effects, but many glassblowers can attest to the accuracy of the statement that water in the scratch reduces the strength of the glass tubing\".\n\nTo cut glass, a cutting tool is used to make a scored line, then the glass is tapped or torqued and the stress concentration at the scratch causes the glass to break along the desired line.\n\nGlassblowers always suggest wetting the scored mark to make the break easier, cleaner, and more reliable. Why does this work?\n\n[Here is a video of the phenomenon.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEAxhMECluM)\n\n[Here is a paywalled article that I can't read.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-fracturing-of-glass/)\n\nI assume that it has something to do with damping vibrations, but I'm not sure.\n\n\u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af",

One takeaway is that the actual amount of water present on the surface of the glass doesn't matter for weakening past a small threshold -- only humidity matters (saturation of water vapor in air -- 100% next to liquid water). However, there is are other explanations offered as well -- the paper notes that \n\n&gt;The 'classical' interpretation involving a chemical reaction at the very tip of a crack is questioned by Tomozawa [16]. As the diffusion of molecular water within glass is activated by stress, he suggests that this diffusion process and the corresponding modification of glass properties in the crack tip area might explain the sub-critical growth.\n\nBut seemingly paradoxically, when glass has absorbed water around a crack and is subject to relatively low stress, this speeds up the crack healing that the material can do naturally (sec. 3.3). \n\nVery interesting stuff. Good find on the paper.",

Since it's, like, a bottle/and or atoms.\nOn the other hand, everything in this observable universe is made up of atoms, so I guess everything could exist in a chemical state, making it a 'chemical' reaction, since, everything could be counted as a chemical at some point. Even if it hasn't been or going to be a chemical",

Im pretty sure its because the atoms of the glass bottle move outwards at the presence of heat and inwards when its cold, whilst the score on the glass weakens a spot, therefore causing a straight break (according to the score on the glass).",

                    "comment": "No. I understand how temperature gradients can cause stress in materials. Of course splashing cold water on hot glass could cause it to shatter, especially if there is already a stress concentration caused by a scored mark. But my question is about a different phenomena. \n\nThis question is specifically about water and glass that are in thermal equilibrium. See other answers for more detail.",

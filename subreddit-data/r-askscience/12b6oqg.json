Could the brine waste from a desalination plant be turned into that mixture to help offset not only the costs of the energy required in desalination, but also to help minimize the waste being dumped elsewhere? \n\nIf this is about as clever as \"use magnets to make a perpetual motion machine,\" I fully understand. Just trying to expand a bit.",

            "comment": "So it might help to understand the process here and why we end up with brine instead of salt.\n\n\nSo first, desalination at large industrial scales is done via reverse osmosis. This process is basically pushing cleaned seawater up against a membrane. The water can pass through the membrane, but the salt dissolved in the water cannot.\n\nThis is much more efficient process than desalination via boiling and condensation. However, it also gets harder and harder to remove only the water from a liquid as the salt concentration increases. For example, if you have a gallon of seawater, separating one cup of pure water from the gallon is easy. But you are left with the same amount of salt in less than 1 gallon of water. The second cup is harder to extract, and makes the remaining liquid more salty. This is why we end up with brine instead of the pure solid salt that you might end up with if you were boiling or heating the water to desalinate it by distillation. \n\n\nIf, like you suggested, we wanted to use the salt for other purposes, such as using molten salt in a reactor, it would need additional processing. You would have to first remove the rest of the water, and then purify the salt. This would take quite a lot of energy and additional money.\n\n\nBut it could be done. The problem is how much water flows through desalination plants, and how much salt that would make.\n\nThe largest desalination plant can produce 1 billion litres of water a day. Let us assume we are 100% efficient and use up 1 billion litres of water (in reality, more seawater would be needed to make 1 billion litres of freshwater).\n\n1 litre of water has ~35 grams of salt. That means the desalination plant could produce 35 thousand metric tons of salt a day. Or, over 12 million metric tons of salt a year.\n\n\nHow much salt is that?\n\n\nThe entire US used approximately 59 million metric tons of salt in 2022. That means, a single desalination plant would produce about 20% of the countries salt needs. However, the  US uses over 300 billion gallons of water per day. So, in order to create enough water for only 1.5% of our water needs, we would create approximately 100% of our salt needs.\n\n\nSimply put, it is ALOT of salt. Trying to just store the salt, would be a massive undertaking that would also be prohibitively expensive. The real best environmental option is to basically build a much larger network of pipes that puts the brine back in the ocean, but over a large enough area that it does not do environmental harm.\n\n\nAs a bonus, besides the obvious fact that the amount of salt in all of the nuclear reactors in the world is miniscule compared to the potential output of a desalination plant. There is also the problem that salt used as reactor coolent is not the same salt we find in the ocean.",

The problem with boiling is that water changes temperature very slowly with heating, so it takes a LOT of heat to make steam, and you would still have to deal with the residual salt.  Might be even more difficult as a solid deposit than as a saline brine. The chemistry is a bit more complicated than that, but the two different processes are more or less just concentration (no significant preferential selection of some elements over others from source to purified water, as a general idea; the residues have the same proportion of materials as the feed even though total concentration is much higher).  \n\nBasically, even though reverse osmosis is very energy-intensive (basically microfiltration that requires a lot of pressure to make water pass the filters), it is still more efficient cost-wise than evaporation/condensation.\n\nMost of the toxicity of brines is due to the extreme dissolved solids content rather than the specific dissolved components (although, just like evaporite salt deposits can have enrichment of somewhat nasty elements like arsenic that make them fairly risky to interact with, it is mostly just the caustic nature of the base salts which presents the problem with the residuals).\n\nMost life on earth does not deal well with extreme salinity, so it is not a good solution to discharge the brines in large proportions  into a regular water body (it will make the water uninhabitable for all but the most salinity-tolerant life).  The volumes involved mean that large areas would be converted from habitable to extremophile environments.  Usually areas we like in the condition that nature made them, and which will be near regions inhabited by lots of people, never mind animals and plants.  A high price to pay so you can live in that near-desert environment.\n\nThere are ways to deal with the briny discharges to minimize impact, but they add to cost and create some problems (dilution to near seawater salinity by mixing with large amounts of seawater requires pumping large amounts of seawater from the ocean to do the dilution, as an example).\n\nRe-use of the brines as feed for other industrial-commercial processes is also possible, but any such process will have its own down-production discharge concerns. It is a complicated problem.  Getting the water is the easy part.  The \"what to do now with all this nasty stuff\" part is the tough side of it.",

The one we eat and that is found in sea water.  \"Salt**s**\" in chemistry are ionic compounds and what ions make up the compound is going to determine how that salt behaves.

Changes to the process which make it more expensive (such as making a huge plant movable and using energy to sail it around) is going to just make it even less feasible.\n\nWe also build desalination plants because we need water in a particular place.

Snow removal is very expensive, especially for all the small towns in the northern parts of the US, so if they could use a waste product California needs to get rid of as their ice removal agent it would help both California and the small northern towns across the country (and even large cities that need snow removal like Chicago, New York, Boston, Pittsburgh, or Detroit).",

One coastal city would outpace total US annual production in a day.  3 or 4 days into operation and it will have made all the salt that our whole species  normally makes in a year.  \n\nWe have no practical application for it.  We have no way to store it safely.

I'm probably oversimplifying, but it's a real phenomenon and not very well understood.",

I'm happy you saw that it wasn't my intention \ud83d\ude42\n\nI'm in Sweden. I've been through opiate withdrawals myself after using practioner prescribed morphine for pain for many years. Eventually, we discontinued the medication gradually. I had three doctors involved who were all adamant that withdrawal, though unpleasant, was not dangerous. All reputable sources in Swedish support this claim too. \n\nThe treatment in Sweden for pharmalogically assisted opioid dependence (LARO) aims to have a higher success rate and fewer relapses, than non-assisted and/or abrupt discontinuation; it's not a programme enforced because withdrawals are life-threatening.\n\nI read through the link you provided and it definitely says in the introduction that withdrawals can be life-threatening, but the topic isn't revisited later in the article. It does say that opioid dependence can be life-threatening, but we already knew that and isn't what is discussed here. So I really didn't find anything saying that you can die from opioid withdrawal.\n\nThree thoughts on this claim, though: 1) user is actually addicted to eg bensodiazepines too and dies from abruptly discontinuing that particular drug, and 2) patient has severe withdrawals and starts using again, on the dose they were on when they first quit, and dies from an overdose, and 3) that they don't drink enough fluid while vomitting or having diarrhea and succumb to dehydration (which actually would be to die from withdrawals in a sense).\n\nYes, alcohol and bensodazepine (abrupt/unassisted) withdrawals can indeed be fatal, I'm familiar with that.",

It is a far too common problem across the world.\n\nThe mechanism for withdrawals of each drug is usually related to the mechanism of action of the drug. In the case of benzodiazepines and alcohol, abrupt withdrawal significantly increases the risk of fatal seizures. For opioids, withdrawals can result in severe diarrhea, mania, high or low blood pressure, and heart attacks. A heart attack would be the most likely way for a person experiencing severe withdrawal to die. Meperidine is another opioid that can cause seizures both from overuse and withdrawal.\n\nAgain, this is very rare, and is usually associated with heavy opioid users on drugs such as fentanyl, heroin, methadone, and other large doses of opioids. You are correct that the majority of opioid withdrawals do not result in death, but it can occur. Much less likely than dying from overdose, however.",

This is why most prescription opiates come with acetaminophen or APAP, as it is one of the most effective analgesics.  What the opiates do however, is dump a ton of dopamine on your neurotransmitters causing you to care less about the pain that you were already in.  For some reason after perceiving less pain you'll actually start to feel less pain too, and I don't just mean on the short term there is an actual correlation between accepting the pain and lessening the pain",

These generally work through inducing secondary messengers like cAMP to block calcium channels and activate potassium channels, which usually makes it much more difficult for pain sensing neurons to transmit signals. The underlying pathology of addiction is related to dopamine release in the addiction centers like the VTA, but that's certainly different from how pain is actually blocked.\n\nTylenol is also not a particularly strong analgesic by any stretch, but it works by inhibiting inflammatory pathways. It's often given in conjunction with opioids because it can reduce swelling and discomfort that isn't strictly pain.",

The opium plant is the most potent natural analgesic that we know of. \n\nThere is no such thing as a \"gold standard\" pain test: not snails, not a hot plate, nope.  Pain is replicated differently in vitro and in animal depending on the drug being tested  You wouldn't use a hot plate test to test for vasoconstrictor for migraines -- it makes no sense. \n\nThough neuropathic pain can be treated with anticonvulsants or tricyclic antidepressants and SNRIs such as you mentioned, these takes weeks of continual use to achieve pain relief.  It is therefore important that they be used in conjunction with other analgesics.  \n\nIt is important that patients understand that OTC drugs such as acetaminophen are not strong pain relievers.  Patients acting with these mistaken ideas may take too much, leading to organ damage, or fail to get adequate pain management before pain pathways become so ingrained that they persist after tissue has healed, leading to chronic pain that can be permanent.\n\nMost patients are not prescribed drugs like gabapentin and lyrica: these are only used for chronic neuropathic pain.  Moreover, these are often not the first choice or doctors; rather they are often prescribed because of limits put on opioid prescriptions by law-makers with little to no understanding of clinical or theoretical pain management.",

My argument was never that opiates aren't good painkillers, I was referring specifically to the topic posed by the original post where he specifically mentioned analgesics in reference to nerve signals.  Also we're currently pulling away from opiates, and many people who were on opiates now take gabapentin or Lyrica, primarily because it is a nerve channel blocker.\n\nNow you are correct in that there are multiple pathways for paying to take, inflammation or itises, neurological or shooting, and finally good old pressure.  The hot plate test that I specifically mentioned, is the one utilized to test neurological or shooting pain.  I can actually give you references to multiple current studies if you'd like.  \n\nI'm also not trying to say you're wrong.  In context of larger scale you are correct that the opiate is a much better pain killer than Tylenol.  But when referring to analgesic properties (meaning specifically neurological pathways in this instance), it really is not Superior.  that said no matter which type of pain you have the opiate will be effective whereas Tylenol will only be effective for pain not originating in the nerves.",

They said that if someone is not currently on/addicted to opioids, it should have no perceivable effect on them, so if you have suspicion someone ODed and is unresponsive, give it to them, as worst case scenario it does nothing. I now worth it could make a shock case worse. Obviously this is a niche scenario, but I wonder if that's true.",

            "comment": "Great question OP! I have a PhD in this topic.\n\nTLDR:\n\n* Drugs such as chemotherapeutic agents that damage the nervous system can enhance pain\n* The term to describe this enhancement is hyperalgesia\n* The processes that cause it are peripheral sensitisation and central sensitisation\n* LTP, or an increase in ion-channel expression at the neuronal synapse, is one of the many mechanisms involved\n* In the case of LTP, the main neurotransmitter is glutamate\n\nAnalgesics are drugs that work by reducing pain, and the opposite of this would be drugs that increase pain. The term used to describe an increased pain response is **hyperalgesia.**\n\nAn example of a condition that can lead to increased pain is chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), which is caused by chemotherapeutic agents that damage the nervous system. This damage can result in peripheral sensitisation, through hyperalgesia and ectopic firing. **Peripheral sensitisation occurs when the threshold for activation of high-threshold pain receptors is lowered, and their responsiveness is enhanced (hyperexcitability) when they are exposed to inflammatory mediators and damaged tissues.** This can lead to central sensitisation as well, but that's a more complicated process [\\[1\\]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5656281/).\n\nLong-term potentiation (LTP) is one mechanism that can lead to sensitisation through increasing ion channel expression at the synapse. It occurs when the connection between neurons is strengthened due to increased firing frequency between them. Some studies have shown that ketamine, which is an NMDA antagonist that inhibits LTP, can have analgesic effects in cases of peripheral sensitisation [\\[2\\]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090380111000917). This shows that LTP is one of the mechanisms involved in sensitisation.\n\nP.S.\n\nThere are also surgical methods to enhance the pain response which we do in research to model disease. One example is chronic constriction of the infraorbital nerve (CCI-ION) to model trigeminal neuralgia.",

How it happens is a little more complicated and controversial. But one of the proposed mechanisms is that the neurones that transmit light touch sensations (A-beta fibres) undergo a wholesale movement at the spinal cord. Usually, they connect with other A-beta touch fibres, but after the movement, they connect to the pain fibres such as A-delta or C-fibres.\n\nImo the most interesting thing about it is that it can lead to painful sensations in a different place from where it was stimulated. You see this in neuropathic pain states like trigeminal neuralgia. Which makes sense if you believe in the wholesale movement of A-beta fibres theory, as they might connect to pain fibres from different locations.",

Some of these cytokines lower the threshold that pain neurons will start to fire at. This is why touching a part of the body that has been hurt is suddenly painful, where applying the same amount of pressure when the body is healthy would not produce the same response.   \n\n\nThere's really not a a lot of indications to make these cytokines into drugs, but one, TNF alpha, has been made into a drug to help ramp up the immune system to fight cancer and has \"pain\" as a side effect. Most non opiate analgesic's block cytokines in one way or another which is how we get pain relief.",

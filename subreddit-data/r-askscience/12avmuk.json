    "postText": "If a photon can't pass through something, then that thing is creating a shadow of some form because a shadow is a lack of photons due to an obstruction. I've heard that some forms of energy, like plasma, don't block photons though. Can photons (not originating from the sun) pass through the center of the sun and make it to the other side?\n\nEx. If you had a laser, could you shine it at the sun and then see that laser on the other side of the sun? (Let's assume the observer on the other side of the sun can differentiate between light from the sun and light from the laser.)",

            "comment": "The sun is not transparent. The visible surface of the sun would be the same even if you disregarded all the emitted light and only considered how much it obscures background objects. Looking at the limb of the sun it can be seen that the sun's surface turns from fully transparent to fully opaque over a distance of maybe hundreds of km as the density of the solar plasma increases the deeper you go. The measure of how translucent something is, ie. how much stuff is needed between you and an object to obscure the latter, is called [optical depth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_depth_(astrophysics\\)) or optical thickness.\n\nPlasma is particularly good at being opaque, as being an ionized gas, all the free electrons in it are very happy to absorb and scatter light as it goes through, much moreso than the same amount of neutral gas would.\n\nThe fact that stars are, indeed, opaque, can be exploited to find binary stars, particularly dimmer companions in close orbits around a brighter, more massive star. If the pair orbits edge-on from our perspective, such that the components [transit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_transit) each other, each transit causes a tiny dip in the binary's total brightness because some of either star's light is blocked by its companion.",

A real-life example of this is the eclipsing ternary star Algol in the constellation Perseus:\n\n\u201cAlgol is a three-star system, consisting of Beta Persei Aa1, Aa2, and Ab \u2013 in which the hot luminous primary \u03b2 Persei Aa1 and the larger, but cooler and fainter, \u03b2 Persei Aa2 regularly pass in front of each other, causing eclipses. Thus Algol's magnitude is usually near-constant at 2.1, but regularly dips to 3.4 every 2.86 days during the roughly 10-hour-long partial eclipses. The secondary eclipse when the brighter primary star occults the fainter secondary is very shallow and can only be detected photoelectrically.\u201d [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algol)\n\nThough both of the main components of Algol are stars generating photons, the dimmer of the two periodically blocks photons of the brighter when moving in front of it as seen from Earth, causing a decrease in brightness or \u201cshadow\u201d. If this weren\u2019t true and photons could pass through the dimmer star, no decrease in brightness would be observed.",

When two stars are next to each other we have a baseline for the brightness of the system as a whole that we can plot as the stars orbit each other. When one passes in front of the other the photons of the star behind get blocked, and thus the total brightness of the system decreases and we can see that drop in luminosity.\n\nSo to answer your question, no, it is very unlikely a photon from another light source would pass completely through the sun without being absorbed by an electron in the sun. Even photons generated in the core of stars from fusion get bounced around from electron to electron countless numbers of times before slowly making it's way towards the surface and escaping. This process can take millions of years and any information from the photons creation would be lost.",

But that high energy state also makes it very luminous as a black body radiator. Individual photons inside the sun are quicky absorbed as others are produced and likely travel very short distances in their very brief lifespans. \n\nThis was the state of the early universe around 0-300,000 years after the big bang. Hot, opaque plasma. \n\nThe moment the universe stopped being opaque, those photons that were given off at that time could finally go much greater distances. Some are still zinging around the universe. But because the universe is expanding, the light has become stretched out from its initially low wavelengths to microwaves, not quite the longest waves, but very close.",

That's taking into account both the wavelengths of light and the total amount of photons its emitting, in essence. \n\nIn theory, absolutely it can cast a shadow - but not in every scenario. \n\nA higher luminosity star than our sun could mean, for this hypothetical star, it's producing much higher frequency light, but physically less photons. If that \"brighter\" star were directly behind our sun, our sun would absorb the light, and thus cast a shadow. Of course, distance would matter, but this is a hypothetical scenario where another star is adjacent to ours, without the stars colliding.\n\nHowever, a more luminous star than our sun could also mean it's emitting, for example a million times the amount of photons, but at a lower wavelength than our solar average. In that case, photons would hypothetically pass through the sun, and thus not produce a shadow.\n\nFun fact: Even though photons could travel entirely through our sun without being affected, the frequency of light that matches the diameter of the sun, is an EXTREMELY low frequency of 0.216 hz, which as I understand, isn't something a star typically even produces.\n\nHope this helps!",

Why would red photons pass through our sun? A star that is more luminous than the sun just means it's emitting more power. If that star is on the main sequence, it would be hotter than our sun, so it would also mean it's bluer and physically larger. A star that is cooler than our sun, and on the main sequence, is automatically less luminous. However, a star that is cooler than our sun, but physically larger, for example because it's very puffy and is now a red giant, i.e. not on the main sequence, will be more luminous. This is because, assuming a black body of a given temperature, more area (i.e. bigger size) means more power. It just happens that, because of internal physics, main sequence stars that are larger (massive) are also bigger (in diameter) and hotter (bluer in color) than our Sun. Check out Herzsprung-Russel diagrams for a nice overview.\n\nPhotons would definitely not pass through our sun, since the optical depth (aka opacity) for the sun, especially deeper inside, is very large. It takes a photon created in the core thousands of years to reach the surface, because it keeps colliding with other particles. Even if a lower energy photon would make it to the sun, inverse compton scattering would boost its frequency up, don't you think? And then, one might add, is it the same photon anyway, after the first collision?\n\nObservationally speaking, in astronomy, we can see that when a star eclipses another, there is a dip in the brightness of the system.  \n\n\nwith regard to radio wavelenghts, it doesn't even count as passing through if the photon has an uncertainty in position larger than our sun.",

In other words, now the matter has too much energy.  It then gives off a photon, which travels on its merry way.\n\nBut it's not the same photon as the one that was absorbed.  It's probably not even the same energy that was absorbed.  Plus, the sun is a lot more than just a ball of plasma.  There's a whole lot of matter there - all being held there by gravity.  Its core is probably extremely dense - far more dense than the Earth.  This is only an educated guess since we haven't actually gone there to measure it.  But it's a pretty well educated guess, if it follows the laws of physics the rest of us do.\n\nSo to answer your question, no.  It's slightly possible, but only in the sense that anything is possible with quantum mechanics.  It's also possible that all your undergarments will spontaneously quantum tunnel one foot to your left.  But it's so extremely unlikely - as a matter of random chance.\n\nI say that largely because I don't get invited to those parties.",

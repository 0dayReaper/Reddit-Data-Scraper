            "comment": "No. You jump highest when the earth is directly overhead *and* when it's directly under your feet. You jump lowest when the earth RISES and SETS on the horizon.\n\nThe constant acceleration of the moon towards the earth cancels out the gravitational pull of the earth on your body. However when you're farthest from the earth, the gravitational pull is *weaker* (so you jump higher) and when you're closest to the earth the gravitational pull is *stronger* (so you also jump higher). This is also how the tides work: high tides are directly underneath the other body AND directly opposite the other body.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation, read about how the sun affects your weight on Earth: https://van.physics.illinois.edu/ask/listing/358366#:~:text=There%20is%20very%20little%20difference,always%20accelerating%20toward%20the%20sun.",

The only thing the presenter is wrong about is that this explanation doesn't contradict the simpler description that the moon's gravity on Earth's surface is stronger at the point facing the moon and weaker at the point facing away from the moon, pulling the water into tides. Those tidal force arrows in the video are showing this same relationship. The video is using another way to describe the same physics.\n\nSee this article on tidal forces which agrees with both: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tide",

(I actually hate this video)\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe funny part is the presenter states so confidently that tides are subtle and even experts get them wrong but here is the real correct version, before going on to be somewhat incorrect. For the record the speaker is a professional astrophysicist and expert in black holes, not tides (which is the sad part because they are so bold over something they are not an expert in and should know better). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat the presenter should do is just get a computer to plot the vector lines of the tidal force in 3D then just look at them at different opposite points of the object and then they will understand that their squeeze description is as incomplete as the stretch description they complain about. The reason being is because any expert in tides knows that the tidal force is BOTH a stretching AND a squeezing at different parts of the planet.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf you plot the dominant mode vector components at the poles of the Earth they are directed radially inwards, that means you have two vectors pointing towards each other, clearly a squeezing. However, at the point closest and furthest on the equatorial plane to the Moon the vectors point radially outwards, a stretching. At various other locations you get either zero forcing and in some locations a tangential shear forcing which is neither a stretching or a squeezing.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWhat makes that video frustrating is it just confuses things by throwing out the simplest tidal model which is to view the system in the 2D orbital plane that is used to motivate and educate the basics of tides in favour of an equally incomplete view. If he has stated the stretching is incomplete and hey look at these different force vectors in 3D you have stretching, squeezing, shear, and null points, aint tides interesting and complex! That would have been significantly better.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nEdit - Just to add an extra bonus grumble. Tides are not like a pimple, not even close, its a terrible analogy. Squeezing a pimple is a surface force applied basically at two points, nothing at all like a tidal force which is a body force and applies everywhere throughout the object.",

But I guess you're right that it isn't the moon alone, iirc the high high is when the moon and sun are on the same side and low high is ~12hrs later when moon and sun are opposite. So maybe it's still valid to ask if you jump slightly higher on the moon when the earth is generally in the direction of the sun",

The farther away you are, the fewer particles there are around. The moon is significantly farther away than any manmade satellite. Additionally being really far away means the moon is moving a lot slower than the closer satellites, so it also encounters fewer particles because of that.\n\nThe moon is also really big. The amount of particles you encounter is proportional to your radius squared, but your mass is proportional to your radius cubed. So being big means that each particle has less effect on you. And the moon is much much bigger than the other satellites\n\nAnd finally, the moon doesn't maintain its orbit. The moon's orbit is actually getting bigger, because of tidal forces. But it takes millions of years to make a noticable difference",

But the difference is very, very, very small. \n\nAnd the reason is not as simple as the Earth's gravity pulling up at the nearest spot and pulling down at the other (which would pretty much be the case if Earth and Moon were in fixed relative positions and not rotating or revolving).\n\nThe explanation lies in the fact that as the Moon orbits around the Earth it takes a certain amount of force from the Earth to keep the Moon in its orbit and we can say (based on Newton's Shell Theorem) that amount is the size of the Earth force ocurring at the centre of the Moon.\n\nHowever Ned and Fran (at the Near and Far points on the Moon) are travelling along orbital paths concentric with that of the Moon's centre. Their orbits have the same angular velocity and orbital period as Moon centre but different radial distances, and different circumferential speeds.  They also experience slightly different strengths of the Earth force (which decreases with the inverse square of the distance from the Earth).  \n\nIt happens that the actual Earth force on Ned at the Near point is **larger** than that required to keep him in that orbit at that distance.  This excess manifests as a small net \"Delta\" force pulling Ned toward the Earth and away from the Moon.  This will slightlly counteract the Moon's gravitational force pulling Ned toward the centre of the Moon. \n\nIt happens also that the actual Earth force on Fran at the Far point is **smaller** than that required to keep her in that orbit at that distance.  This deficit manifests as a small net \"Delta\" force pushing Fran away from the Earth and away from the Moon.  This will slightlly counteract the Moon's gravitational force pulling Fran toward the centre of the Moon. \n\nWe can calculate these \"Delta Forces\" and it turns out that they are of very similar magnitude for both Ned and Fran ( about 3.GM.m.r /D^3 ).\n\nBut actually there is a very, very, very small difference which makes the \"up-force\" on Ned greater than that on Fran (by about 6.GM.m.r^2 /D^4 ).  \n\nThus Ned will be able to jump a tiny bit higher than Fran.\n\nHere G is Big G, M is Earth's mass, m is the astronaut mass, r is the Moon radius and D is the distance between centres of Moon and Earth.\n\n(For actual values see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_force #Sun,Earth,Moon).",

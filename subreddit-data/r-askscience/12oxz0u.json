I once saw this really clear difference between groups in a cool, understudied gene. Then I realized only the female patients express it and by chance there were a couple more females in my experimental group haha. Disappointing but hey, it wasn\u2019t described as a sex-specific gene before so that\u2019s at least a potentially new discovery.",

Also, there's a certain gene that, while not necessarily a biomarker, appears to be \"important\" to that disease - but its protein can be cleaved into pieces that act like miRNA and inhibit target translation. But what are those targets? Nobody knoooowwwsss... And is the protein important as itself, or as the miRNA-like pieces? Nobody knooowwwsss... And where exactly is the protein cleaved (ie; what are the sequences/structures/affinities of these pieces? Nobody knoooowwwsss...\n\nThe kicker: a few of those lincRNAs can ALSO be cleaved into miRNA-like pieces and inhibit translation. Mechanism/triggers/sequence/structure/function/context?

What starts as a tiny insertion/deletion/point/nonsense  mutation can have major impacts on what the protein turns out to be. And yes, a lot of these are \"known quantities\" so to speak, but so so many of them aren't. So how do these aberrant proteins interact with downstream effectors/coactivators/corepressors, etc.? What is the end result? \n\nWith cancer, where the rules are made up and the points don't matter, relying on \"but we already know\" is a dangerous game. I work in Individualized Medicine, and I can tell you for certain that every patient's tumor is unique - and who is to say that all of the genomic irregularities we currently classify as \"noise\" aren't actually contributing in a meaningful way? I mean, outside of a handful of Very Well-Studied alterations, the best we can predict for most driver mutations is \"likely deleterious\", etc.\n\nMy specific niche seems to be pointing out that linear thinking doesn't work when it comes to cellular behavior and signaling. It really requires more of a network-thinking approach, and you would be surprised at how difficult that seems to be for many scientists used to the one-molecule-at-a-time approach. My biggest frustration currently is that it is nearly impossible to lay out a realistic start-to-finish visualization of the interconnectedness of things at the per-gene/protein level with annotations for a patient's genomic profile.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is: *AI people, we need you!* But your stuff has to be really effin' reliable, because we're treating real people here. Use VERY LARGE data sets for training. Make them cancer-agnostic but cell type-specific. Make sure your training data includes different ethnicities, different ages, and is half women. Don't throw out the outliers just because they're outliers (cancer thrives in the outliers!).\n\nI personally think the AI revolution can't come soon enough (at least for this stuff).",

Although DNA methylation can regulation expression, the chromosomal landscape inferred by histone modifications play a much bigger role in making the DNA accessible.\n\nLooking at expression tells you the end result of how those modifications affect transcription. RNA-seq paired with chromatin modifications can tell you a lot about whether the various histone modifications promote or repress expression of specific genes.\n\nFrom chromosomal material alone, no, unless the prerequisite studies have been shown that specific epigenetic modifications change transcription specifically in the genes you are interested in.",

If a book is completely open, it\u2019s easy to gain information from it; if a book is closed, you can\u2019t gain information from it until you open it; if a book is slightly open, it might be hard but still doable. The environment you live in slightly changes how your DNA works. It can\u2019t give you new genes (books) or remove the ones you already have, but it can severely impact the \u201copenness\u201d of the books. The \u201cenvironment\u201dconstitutes of about everything in your life: diet, stress, habits, everything. The branch of genetics that studies what and how changes depending on the environment is called epigenetics.\n\nOur sex is determined by 2 special chromosomes called XX (female) or XY (males). These chromosomes, just like the environment we live in, contain special information (epigenetic factors) that regulates the openness of some of the books. For instance the Y chromosome might influence the book titled \u201chairy face\u201d on the 14th chromosome (random number, it\u2019s just an example) opening it completely, while it is completely closed in the female. This means that if we look at the 14th chromosome (again, random number) and we see that the book \u201chairy face\u201d is closed, it was probably part of the DNA of a female person. If it is open, chances are it comes from a man\u2019s DNA.\n\nThe \u201copenness of the books\u201d is basically how tightly the DNA is clumped. Very clumped = hard to read, loosely clumped = easy to read. The clumping is operated by a number of things including proteins and other chemical stuff and epigenetic factors affect these things rather than the DNA itself.",

Of course, it also requires that we know what the female/male-specific cell populations look like ahead of time.

Both sex and math are way more complicated than those basics. When folks simplify sex to just chromosomes, it sounds like they\u2019re insisting calculus isn\u2019t real because they learned algebra first. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong in asking your question, it was appropriate to make a generalization here. I just want to preface my answer by calling out this common issue. \n\nFor the most part, no, chromosomes 1-22 are indistinguishable between different sexes. The best you can do is make some guesses based on conditions which are more prevalent in one sex than another. \n\nChromosome 1 is largely instructions for creating essential protein complexes throughout the body. Things that are necessary for cellular function. It is gigantic. It does contain genes linked to several genetic disorders, some of which are more prevalent in one sex than another. So you may be able to infer, by the presence or absence of certain diseases, a percent likelihood of the person being a particular sex. However, the condition being more prevalent in one sex may actually be linked to expression of the gene or interactions with hormones. So this is not a reliable measure. \n\nChromosome 2 has our Homeobox structure, which is what tells us how our body parts go together. This is if that \u201cthe hip bone\u2019s connected to the\u2026 thigh bone!\u201d song were a chromosomal structure. There are some other genes in there too, but the important bit is the assembly manual for the body. Nothing in there yet about sex, since all those parts go in the same spot. \n\nAs you move up in number, the chromosomes are smaller. The instructions are, in general, more and more specific. By the time you get to determining sex on chromosome 23, you\u2019re talking about a tiny region of the smallest chromosome, the SRY region. That little tiny chunk of code is what tells the body to develop masculine traits. Now, if you moved around a chunk of chromosome 1 and attached it to another chromosome instead, that would create an unviable being. Couldn\u2019t live. But if you take that SRY chunk and attach it to a different chromosome, you can still develop a phenotypically normal being. This does actually happen sometimes: it\u2019s called chromosomal translocation.\n\nSo in the rare case you come across someone who has a translocation of chromosome 23, you may find the SRY region attached to one of chromosomes 1-22. That would be your very very rare \u201cyes you can!\u201d answer.",

Furthermore you can get inverted phenotype even without SRY translocation in an even more rare case of XX male development. \n\nSex is so hormone controlled that realistically you can decouple it from genetics of the target individual, it's possible to control on the parent side too.

In certain special cases, you may be able to make an educated guess based on something you find, but those cases are rare.\n\nFor example, occasionally the SRY gene can jump off of chromosome 23 and land on another chromosome. It still works when it's on another chromosome, so if you find an SRY gene on another chromosome, you can make a pretty good guess that you're looking at male genes.\n\nBut of course, there's nothing preventing someone with an SRY on chromosome 18 from also having Swyer Syndrome, so there's still no guarantees here.",

Which it really shouldn't be, but unfortunately it is.\n\nScience is a process by which we continually challenge and then update our understanding of the world around us. Given what we understood about the world 200 (or 2000) years ago, the concept of sex was not an unreasonable framework to work from. But as we've developed more and more tools to look more closely at the individual people and how they get sorted in to sex, we find there is actually no common thread to either group that doesn't rely on assumptions that are provably false.\n\nUnfortunately, we kind of built a whole-ass society around the distinctions between \"male\" and \"female\" and even as we've made some progress towards dismantling that over the last hundred years, it's still extremely embedded in our culture.\n\nAccepting that \"sex\" isn't actually a valid way to categorize people means upending ALL of that, and a lot of people are too stuck in their ways (or receiving too many benefits from \"sex\" based social structures) to be willing to upend the social order in order to accommodate... you know... reality.\n\nIf \"sex\" weren't so entrenched in every aspect of our society, it would have been rejected as a scientific concept at least 20 years ago, and probably closer to 40 in much the same way that humors were rejected as a scientific concept 150-170 years ago.\n\nEdit: That doesn't mean that we would necessarily stop using \"sex\" for anything in science. There are all sorts of places that we knowingly use shortcuts that are scientifically invalid, but still close enough that they can be useful in certain situations. For example, we know Newtonian gravity is wrong, but it's still such a close approximation that we can still use it for pretty much anything on the scale of our solar system or smaller and get an answer that's off by less than the best engineering tolerances in the world, so who cares that it's technically wrong?\n\nTo be clear, the concept of \"sex\" is off by at least 1% -- WAY further off than Newtonian gravity, but it can still be useful for population level work.",

            "comment": "Technically possible. There is a phenomenon called \u201cepigenetics\u201d, that your DNA could have \u201cmarks\u201d on them. They could be different on different cells and different individuals. A paper tried to characterise the differences in epigenetic marks between male and female. I don\u2019t know how definitive they are, but I bet there will be some more certain marks that associate with biological sex.\nhttps://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13148-022-01279-7\n\nHowever, to know the epigenetic landscape, you will need to perform molecular techniques like bisulphite-sequencing. And if you could do such techniques, you could already tell from the sex chromosomes.\n\nIt actually leads to an interesting question. Could this be one of the mechanism of sexually associated traits? And could this be one of the mechanisms so called sexually associated traits are so diverse in individuals?",

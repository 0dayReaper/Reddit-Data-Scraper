            "comment": "Because the dollar store readers are not made to correct hyperopia (\u201cfarsightedness\u201d); they are made to correct presbyopia (the loss of focusing flexibility that hits all of us in our early 40s). Presbyopia occurs in all of us in a relatively equal way, so making a standardized power for presbyopia is easy.\n\nBasically, the cheater readers are making the assumption that the wearer has perfect distance vision, and simply brings the focal point forward to a comfortable reading distance.\n\nNow, plus power lenses that correct for presbyopia also happen to help with hyperopia. However, unless your hyperopia just coincidentally happens to be equal between your eyes, free of astigmatism, and of a small enough amount, the readers are only partially correcting it. It may be better than nothing, or even good enough for practical use in many cases, but they do not usually fully or adequately correct the hyperope\u2019s vision.\n\nAs far as myopia (\u201cnearsightedness\u201d) goes, its generally too unique to the individual to standardize in a \u201cdrug store reader\u201d kind of way. Plus if people are self-diagnosing/correcting myopia, they almost always tend to overcorrect it, making them prone to eyestrain, headaches, and if they are young enough, a worsening of their prescription. In fact a huge part of the refraction procedure (\u201cone or two?\u201d) is making sure the patient hasn\u2019t overcorrected themselves.\n\nSource: I\u2019m an optometrist",

I'm pretty sure this Wavefront thing is it: [https://www.allaboutvision.com/eye-exam/wavefront.htm](https://www.allaboutvision.com/eye-exam/wavefront.htm)\n\n&gt;Wavefront technology developed for custom LASIK may soon be used routinely by eye doctors to better diagnose vision problems in eye exams, perhaps making the familiar eye chart obsolete.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Most people have had eye exams with a device called a phoropter, which contains many lenses of different powers. An ophthalmologist or optometrist changes the lenses in front of your eyes, asking which lens produces the best image.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;With this conventional approach, information you give the eye doctor is very subjective, based more on what you think you see instead of what you actually see. But a wavefront measurement is objective, because vision errors can be identified automatically by the way light waves travel through the eye.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Someday, these detailed wavefront measurements may replace conventional eyeglass or contact lens prescriptions, which describe vision problems only in terms of the eye's nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Just as custom (or \"wavefront-guided\") LASIK has the potential for producing sharper vision than conventional LASIK, glasses and contact lenses made with this advanced technology may also produce better visual clarity than their conventional counterparts.",

You can be farsighted and still need a full time correction for distance vision, and this is in fact the most common correction for someone with hyperopia. \n\nPeople who can purchase off the shelf reading glasses tend to have Presbyopia not Myopia (near-sighted) or Hyperopia (far-sightedness). As off the shelf readers (and reading glasses in general) have focal points of about 14 inches. Which means that they are 100% useless for wearing for day to day tasks. \n\nThe majority of people with Hyperopia must wear their glasses 100% of the time so also have a focal distance of infinity. \n\n/u/simrc86\n\nEDIT: forgot to mention I\u2019m an Optician.",

It is certainly true that my farsightedness expressed itself as very early presbyopia but now I just walk around wearing +1.5 or +2 reading glasses and read books with +3 or +4 reading glasses (and do fine craft work with +5 to +7 correction either with high powered reading glasses or with reading glasses stacked with magnifying lenses).  I can literally buy glasses for $5 at home depot that do what I seem to need.  What am I doing wrong?",

You\u2019ve developed Hyperopia overtime (why a lower powered lens allows you to see in your day to day) and also have presbyopia. Likely what you considered presbyopia at the start was simply the beginnings of Hyperopia and now you\u2019ve progress to a state of having both. \n\nThe other thing you might be missing out on with simple off the shelf readers is an astigmatism correction. Which can also cause some fuzziness in objects at any range of vision. \n\nBut like I said it\u2019s impossible to tell without knowing your prescription.",

It\u2019s blurry and skewed compared to just appearing small. You have to put on those complicated eye exam machines with hundreds of compound lenses to find the most comfortable correction. Probably FAR less than 1% of the worlds population can even wear my prescription and not suffer terrible headaches, not to mention run into everything near them. \n\nlight is hitting my eyes and scattering and warping and being projected incorrectly onto my retinas. A computer can only simulate this if you add a blur effect via a image manipulation program and you\u2019d have a tough time using one glass lens to correct it. Another wrinkle is that near viewing is usually straight forward at a max of arm length and far viewing includes peripheral and the light is hitting different areas of your eye and the lens is different distance from your eyeball. \n\nSource: long-standing near-blind glasses wearer",

Dean Butler spoke to the [*Los Angeles Times*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Times),  admitting that Luxottica's dominance of the eyewear industry had  resulted in price markups of nearly 1,000%. In the interview, Butler  noted \"You can get amazingly good frames, with a [Warby Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warby_Parker)  level of quality, for $4 to $8. For $15, you can get designer-quality  frames, like what you\u2019d get from Prada.\u201d When told that some eyeglasses  cost as much as $800 in the United States, Butler remarked, \u201cI know.

They should be a commodity, however there's basically one company that owns all the glasses companies.  They make it look like ALL the glasses are similarly priced so the consumer feels he can choose between companies, but the price will always be about the same.  You don't feel like you are getting ripped off since everything is in the same price range.  The other reality is that most of these optometrists are doubling the cost on top of your already high prices.  They get away with this because they know you have some insurance to cover part of the price.  For example, I recently bought a set of frames from Simon Eye for $300 minus $120 from my insurance.  When I got home, I found the identical frames on Amazon for $180.  I wish some brave lawyers would go after these guys with an antitrust suit that would stick.",

The majority of the market is dominated by one manufacturer, which also owns a majority of the retail outlets, which also (90% chance) runs your vision insurance.  So, they making the glasses, in some cases the lenses, administering your insurance, and own a lot of the retail places where you're buying glasses at.  Essentially, at any point you enter the product world of glasses you're getting screwed by a huge monopoly.  The other piece of this is a lot of these retail centers the people there actually earn commissions.  Those lens upgrades, how many different companies produce anti glare? Scratch resistance?  They're selling you options that you can't really see and unless you need transition lenses don't really need. I recently had lasik surgery but before that I would order frames/lenses with no coatings and not have issues ($17 dollars was what i paid after my last exam &amp; pair of glasses).

            "comment": "Finally something where I can contribute.\n\nEvery person has a certain range of distance where they can see things sharp. For someone with \"perfect\" eyes the furthest point is infinity. Their eyer are relaxed, and they focus stuff far away perfectly. The closest point they can see sharp (when they strain their eyes really hard and \"squish\" the lens) is around 15 cm from their eyes, but it gets further away with age. This is by the way why old people are far sighted.\n\nSo what do glasses do? In their simplest case, they just shift those points. But of course they shift both points! So they pull them closer to you, or push them further away.\n\nNow what about farsightedness and nearsightedness? You can imagine those conditions as shifting of the two points described before. One or both points can be shifted. Let's look at common possibilities:\n\n\\- If you are a \"normal\" old person, your closest point just got further away. This means your range is smaller, but you still recognize faces at the distance. When you want to read something, you need to move your close point closer to your eyes, so that your reading material is in your focal range. But since you will not be able to see things far away with glasses anyway (your far point also moved away from infinity, and is now somewhere around a couple meters away from your eyes) it doesnt really matter how far you shift.\n\n\\- If you are a \"normal\" nearsighted person, then typically your lense is squished, so that both your points are closer to your eyes. What you want to do with glasses, is to put your far point at EXACTLY infinity. This way you can relax your eyes, and see stuff far away. If you move it \"beyond infinity\", then your eye has to work all the time while you are walking about in your glasses and focus stuff. This will give you a headache.\n\n\\- (The farsightedness where the lense is deformed can also happen. Then your far point is beyond infinity. It is really hard to notice though, because your eyes can just focus. Its just they are never relaxed. So people only get their eyes checked after headaches at school or something. Those people also need expensive glasses.)",

            "comment": "The simple answer is that due to the distances they work at, it is fairly easy to correct a minor error in prescription for reading glasses/glasses for far sightedness, and virtually impossible to correct an error in prescription with distance/glasses for near sightedness.\n\nTo explain in a bit more depth, when we need glasses, it is when our eyes are unable to focus correctly. When we wear glasses, they project the image of what we see on front of us, and purposely misfocus it slightly so that when the glasses and our eyes are combined, the misfocus cancels out and we can once again see clearly.\nGlasses are pretty simple devices though, and only focus correctly at one distance - so for someone that is longsighted and needs reading glasses, they will be designed to focus at normal reading distances. For someone near sighted that needs glasses to see far away, they will be designed to focus far away.\n\nIf you wear the wrong strength glasses, what this means is that they are focussing at the wrong distance. This can be compensated for however by changing the distance of whatever it is you are looking at (compared to your eyes) - so by holding your book slightly further away or slightly closer, you are counteracting the error.\nWith distance vision however, you cannot really change this distance easily - if you are looking at a mountain a kilometer away, you would need to move a huge distance to bring it close enough to offset the error. \nTo use some numbers, if you need to change the distance between your eye and the object by 10% to correct the error in prescription, holding something at arm's length may mean moving your book by 5cm, which you do without realising. If you need to change the distance between your eye and an object by the same 10% for something that is a kilometer away, that means moving your eye by 100m.\n\nSo the end result is that reading glasses can be sold in rough grades, and rely on the fact that people instinctively adjust what they are doing to correct any erroe. Distance glasses cannot be adjusted, so need to be fine tuned to work exactly for your eyes.",

Therefore a ton of people need the same kind of glasses. This is a great target for a mass product.\n\nIf a younger person needs glasses, it's because they have a condition with their eyesight. Those conditions can be of all kinds, resulting in all kinds of complex prescriptions, usually different between the eyes. No economies of scale here.",

Now, of course you need to know what strength the lenses need to be, but in most places there is no need to have a valid prescription.\n\nFor comparison, I have two (ugly) pairs of glasses for my nearsightedness that were 5\u20ac each with the same lens strength as my main glasses. I suspect the main reason for the price is that people want fancier frames for \"everyday\" glasses, while reading glasses are worn only sporadically and thus can be uglier.",

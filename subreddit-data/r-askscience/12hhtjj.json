Living things just want to stay alive. If there is not enough food to go around, but then one of them is born with something hard in their mouth and now they can scrape off the green lichen of the rocks and use it as food, then the one with the teeth will have an advantage to making more offspring. Its offspring will have that advantage too. Over time, the thing-with-teeth will be its own species because there will be other little things that differ them from the thing-without-teeth, and over time the two species won't be able anymore to produce offspring together.\n\nBut that's not to say the original thing-without-teeth always will vanish. As long as there is - longterm - enough food to go around and not too many things that eat them, there's really no reason for them to die out.",

            "comment": "Well, evolution doesn't have a target. Species evolve and adapt due to evolutionary pressures, such as changes in temperatures and other conditions or invasion of new predators, etc.\n\nIf a species faces no pressure, then most mutations will offer no benefit to survival and many will actually be detrimental.\n\nIn this way, a species can show little change over long periods of time.\n\nHowever if conditions change or emigrate to a new area with slightly changed conditions, there exists a new evolutionary pressure. Suddenly some mutations become beneficial and thus the individuals in this area evolve. \n\nIn our example: A bony fish emigrates into coastal waters. In this region, new survival strategies become viable. There's nutrients in the soil that can be used as a new source of nutrition. A fish with slightly malformed fins now suddenly has an advantage because it's fins are better suited to digging through mud. This leads to fins that can also be used to \"walk\" in the mud, rather them swimming. Then insects start breading in the swamp. A fish that can walk short stretches through mud above water suddenly has an advantage and thus has many more offspring. Of these fish, some have a mutation that allows them to absorb small amounts of oxygen from the air, which is now suddenly useful... Etc. In this way some creatures evolve where beneficial, while others already have a very viable build in an environment with little to no changes.",

He talks about how a species may be distributed widely over a geographic area, and how differences in the conditions of different areas can explain, by the different selection pressures they produce, the differential evolution of the species in different places.\n\nSo, lobe-finned fishes 400mya were evolved to fit in a relatively deep-water niche. Over time they became widely distributed through the seas and rivers - some of them lived in shallower waters, some in deeper waters.\n\nTetrapods descend from some of those that lived in shallower waters, right up to muddy coastal areas - the rest mostly went extinct, except for some that lived in deep waters - where they were already pretty well-adapted - and their descendants today are coelocanths, who still look very similar to their ancient ancestors.",

This means the expected outcome is that countries with less access to higher education would see greater population growth. That is accurately reflected in global population growth. The more developed a country becomes the more its population begins to gain access to education and birth control improves. Turns out most people don't plan on having 5+ children. Go figure.",

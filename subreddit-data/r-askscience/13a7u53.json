            "comment": "In the case of birds, they have an oil gland near the base of their tail that has vitamin D precursor in it. The birds use their preening oil to clean their feathers, and in the process the oil gets exposed to UV. The exposed uv gets incidentally consumed by the bird during the preening process. The UV light necessary for this process cannot pass through glass, so pet birds that are never allowed outside end up deficient in calcium because vitamin D is necessary for calcium utilization. A common symptom of calcium deficiency is feather plucking. So if you have an indoor bird that has a plucking problem, one possibility is that it needs direct sunlight. 15 minutes of direct sunlight per day is what vets recommend for birds.",

That is why vitamin D is called a \u201ccut steroid\u201d or secosteroid, because the UV light breaks open one of the rings in the steroid ring system. So if people wonder why UV light is needed to produce vitamin D, the answer is to provide the chemical energy to break sigma bonds between the 9,10 carbons in the B ring",

A few drops of vitamins in the water won't do it either, you need to feed the types of greens and fruits that provide what that species needs, as well as sunlight.)\n\nUnfortunately I lost my Timneh  because they actually screwed up the supplements in the food I was using. :&lt;\n\nParrots are harder to properly care for than people expect. I did everything I could and yet he passed away too young.

Baseball hats are apparently the sign of great evil to birds, and needed to be destroyed at all costs.",

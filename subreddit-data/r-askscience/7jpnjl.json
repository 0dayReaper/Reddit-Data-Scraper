            "comment": "The easy answer is no. If you mean combustion (or burning) of the bread, then there would be less calories because once combustion occurs (even partial) the byproducts are either indigestible or barely so. \n\nIf you mean dark toast, the kind you might get at 6 on the toaster, it has the same calories. The Maillard reaction is what drives browning and it is a complex process where proteins denature and bind to other proteins as well as carbohydrates and so forth created an amalgam of mixed molecules. Essentially this is what leads to that caramel/nuttiness you get when things are browned. However, this conformational change and denaturation does not decrease the calories because the overall building blocks are the same and still digestible.\n\nHowever, if let\u2019s say a byproduct of a Maillard reaction is an indigestible molecule that was previously digestible, you could argue that it is now lower in caloric value because it is no longer bioavailable energy. \n\nSide note, a lot of people are talking about measuring calories by using a bomb calorimeter aka burning the item. This is no longer the method used for finding caloric value of food. Instead they find the net average of Atwater bioavailable nutrients and then use standardized values (e.g. 4 Kcal/g for Carbohydrates) to calculate the assumed caloric value. Again, this is obviously dependent on bioavailable sources of energy, not overall stored energy.\n\nA perfect example of how a bomb calorimeter is not a feasible option, is Lettuce. Excluding the water (which is 95% of the material) lettuce is primarily fiber. Insoluble fiber in this case or in other words fiber we cannot breakdown (Cellulose). This material has no caloric value to us because it is not bioavailable (aside from small amounts created by gut fermentation thanks to helpful bacteria). So a piece of lettuce has a net caloric value of basically 0 in the Atwater system. In a bomb calorimeter however, it might have a much higher value because inside each of those cellulose walled cells is stored sugars, proteins, and so forth. Additionally, cellulose is essentially a starch made up of Beta-Glucose, however Beta-glucose is in a different conformation than Alpha-Glucose in starches we digest which means it is incompatible with our enzymes. However, combustion wise, cellulose and amylose (Alpha-glucose polysaccharide aka starch to most people) are equivalent in \u201cCalories\u201d in the context of a bomb calorimeter.  \n\nAgain, this is not the case in bioavailability. The only animals that can actually get the full caloric potential from plant material are foregut fermenters and hindgut fermenters, aka Cows and Horses. This is why they need multiple stomachs or a large cecum, in order to host helpful microorganisms to breakdown cellulose. Even Termites are not able to digest cellulose, but usually carry symbiotic organisms that can. \n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-food-manufacturers/\n\nAddl. Note: /u/chuggsipas pointed out the fact that to be totally accurate about this discussion we have to really highlight that a Calorie at its base definition is the amount of energy required in order to raise one gram of water, by one degree Celsius. It\u2019s important to distinguish this because while I do mention that a bomb calorimeter is not used for nutritional labeling values, it is the correct way to calculate calories in its true context. Another thing chugg brought up, and I absolutely agree with, is the fact that nutritional calories are a terrible measure of how our body uses energy. We do not just ingest and combust whatever is bioavailable, there are a multitude of processes that are dedicated to metabolism, storage, availability, etc that are not taken into account by flat caloric values. In fact evidence builds every year that quality of foods and caloric sources are more important than the overall calorie value. However, on some very basic level you can get a vague idea of your energy intake with the Atwater calorie system. \n\nEdit: Added some clarification in regards to glucose in Cellulose.\n\nEdit2: Fucked up and did L/D-Glucose instead of Alpha/Beta. Corrected that :X \n\nEdit 3: Just wanted to say thank you to anyone who challenged or questioned anything I wrote. I definitely needed to add some information and make changes here and there. I appreciate it, especially since that\u2019s what healthy discussion is about, and no one can be 100% correct, 100% of the time without some input from others! ",

                    "comment": "I forgot to add that some foods increase in caloric value upon cooking them because the nutrients become more bioavailable. A great example of this are potatoes or carrots, where heating the starchy plants causes breakdown and rupture of most of the cells holding starch molecules, which allows the starches to be directly metabolized. So the Atwater caloric value increases, but the actual caloric value (of potential energy for let\u2019s say combustion) has not changed, which again shows you that this is an example of accessibility to nutrients and not overall energy changes.

With such a large brain to body mass ratio, it seems obvious that we need to consume more calories than our bodies would normally be able to absorb raw. Large animals with large brains and correspondingly large digestive systems, like elephants, can eat all day to fuel their brains. But we needed to compensate for our comparatively small digestive systems, so we began cooking food before consumption. This also means we wouldn't need as much food to satisfy our caloric requirements, meaning less hunting and gathering and more time to make tools, invent religion and language, and raise children.\n\n&gt;Glucose is virtually the sole fuel for the human brain, except during prolonged starvation. The brain lacks fuel stores and hence requires a continuous supply of glucose. It consumes about **120 g daily**, which corresponds to an energy input of about **420 kcal (1760 kJ)**, accounting for some **60% of the utilization of glucose by the whole body in the resting state**. Much of the energy, estimates suggest from 60% to 70%, is used to power transport mechanisms that maintain the Na+-K+ membrane potential required for the transmission of the nerve impulses. The brain must also synthesize neurotransmitters and their receptors to propagate nerve impulses. Overall, glucose metabolism remains unchanged during mental activity, although local increases are detected when a subject performs certain tasks.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22436/",

There was nothing in our instincts to say \"I need more calories! Cook those potatoes!\"\n\nThe more plausible explanation would be that our brain size had been limited by our calories *until* pre-humans started cooking. Once these smaller-brained ancestors started cooking, there were more calories available, and so larger brains became possible (or, specifically, they became a positive fitness, rather than a negative one).\n\n(That's all under the assumption that bigger brains require cooking, of course, which is actually [not well supported](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4842772/).)",

(1967) and Drenick et al. (1972). The brain\u2019s need for energy during prolonged starvation can be met by the high ketogenic capacity of the liver which can produce up to 150 g ketones/day (Flatt, 1972; Reichard et al., 1974). Despite the liver\u2019s high energy consumption, it cannot catabolize ketones, so they diffuse into the circulation where they become available to all organs. However, as starvation progresses, other organs, particularly skeletal muscle, come to use free fatty acids more efficiently so ketones therefore become increasingly available for the brain which has no other energy substrate to replace low glucose (Owen and Reichard, 1971; Drenick et al., 1972).\n\nSource:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4937039/",

Experiments on snakes found they absorbed 60% more calories from cooked food when compared to uncooked, and humans as similar. \n\nBut it also depends on the foods themselves. Some, like milk, eggs, fruit and many more are pretty much the same, cooked or uncooked. Plants and meat yield more nutrients and energy when cooked - eg a raw carrot is nowhere near as useful than a cooked carrot.\n\nHumans have a significantly shortened gut when compared to what it 'should' be, and that is likely driven by obtaining more calories by cooking. This shortened bowel in turn frees up energy we would otherwise be spending to digest for our brain (or so a really interesting theory on human evolution goes). In short: cooking allowed our brain to expand.\n\nEDIT: but note that this might not extend to this scenario since the bread was already milled to flour, fermented and cooked. All those processes make it easier for us to extract calories. Toasting might not add anything here, and certainly does reduce calories fractionally by burning sugars and starches we would otherwise digest.",

Firstly, they expend very little energy by moving around, so immediately you've got a pretty decent control on your digestion environment. \n\nSecondly, they have a stomach pH really similar to a human (around 1.5 ish, ours is between 1.5 and 3.5ish). \n\nThirdly, the fact that they don't move much when they're digesting (it takes up all their energy) combined with their really simple body shapes allows scientists to use monitoring equipment on them really easily. It's easy to put a sensor with a wire on it on a piece of food and have said snake eat it whole (and not chew it to pieces). The snake is too busy sleeping and digesting to notice a wire from a probe coming out of its mouth and it allows for pretty comprehensive monitoring of all the things going on in its stomach.\n\nI don't know exactly why for sure and the actual reason for that's particular experiment might be different, but those factors make a lot of sense to me. \n\nEDIT: here's a source that vaguely backs up my tenuous attempt at an explanation:\n\nhttp://jeb.biologists.org/content/206/10/1600",

By cooking stuff, you break starches down to simpler sugars which yield more energy as there's less of an investment into disassembling them.",

Many of these arguments have their basis in exactly one researcher, Richard Wrangham's, findings with no other supporting evidence. And the only conclusion that he's actually come to is that cooked foods are \"easier\" to digest than raw foods, which is an agreed upon fact by the scientific community but true only to a very small extent. As in yes the raw carrot requires more energy to digest because your body has to spend a bit more energy breaking down fiber, but the difference is negligible. And although your body can skip a bit of the breaking down fiber step, there is no supporting evidence that the process is led up at all. In fact the entire \"our digestive sy system is shorter than it's supposed to be\" argument is often made by pseudo-nutritionists that are not considering the fundamental differences between the digestive systems of different animals (like humans compared to snakes...). More info on that [here. ](http://ucdintegrativemedicine.com/2016/03/youre-not-cow-gorilla-dont-eat-like-one-either/#gs.Shfmqao) \n\nBack to Wrangham, [here's](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2011/12/08/why-calorie-counts-are-wrong-cooked-food-provides-a-lot-more-energy/#.WjJfVoVOmEc) an article he wrote about his work, where he actually complains that no one believes his theories and then goes on to brag about how his findings were confirmed by a student *in his lab*. That's not how it works. [This article](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/02/have-we-been-miscounting-calories) about his and other research on the topic suggests that other researchers agree with him, but if you really read the quotes all they're saying is that the body has to work a tiny bit harder to dig through fiber to get to nutrients. They do not confirm his theories. \n\nSource: All linked and two food and dietetics degrees",

Having a long digestive tract is quite costly, but the benefits outweigh those costs when the diet of an organism  consists of raw foods (and especially vegetables and the like), as it allows it to extract more nutritional value.  \n\nWhen the ancestors to humans started cooking their food, the nutritional values of the food they were eating became much more accessible. This meant that individuals with a shorter digestive tract could still obtain all the nutrition, but had to pay less upkeep as that digestive tract was shorter. \n\nSo individuals with the right genetic makeup, a genetic makeup that resulted in shorter digestive tracts, suddenly had an evolutionary edge over those with a longer tract. Over time, with the accumulation of random mutations that shortened the digestive track (and thus increased the fit), the digestive tract got shorter and shorter.\n\nOnce that evolutionary process started, it meant that digestion took less resources allowing for other costly stuff that have a positive effect of the fit to develop (like brains). This meant that selection even more strongly favoured one direction, namely the combination of shorter digestive tracts combined with more brains.\n\nNow it's all a bit more complicated, but this means that the effect of starting to eat cooked food on brain size takes place on an evolutionary timescale, not a day-to-day one. Starting to eat raw food now doesn't suddenly affect brain size. ",

Regular toast already has caramelised sugar and carbohydrates, burnt toast will have some of those turned to indigestable carbon, but also more of the starch and sugar in the centre of the slice caramelised.  Assuming that the caramelised bread has more digestable calories than untoasted bread, at the start of toasting the calories would increase,  then at a certain point it start to burn, destroying digest able material. After this point you have 2 processes, conversion of bread to toast happening near the core of the slice and conversion of toast to burnt crap, happening near the surface, the first increasing calories, the second decreasing them.   Now depending on which is faster the increase in calories could slow down, or it could reverse. If the rates are matched calories go down as the caramel zone stays the same and the bread core is depleted.   If conversion to carbon is faster at reducing callories or matched then the point just before burning is peak toast calories, if it is slower then peak toast calories will occur when the core of the bread is fully toasted with no fluffy white bread to convert to caramelised bread and only conversion to indigestable carbon is occurring. Of course both rates could change during toasting leading to a crossover.   \nThis is all assuming that toast is more digestable than bread, otherwise all toast is lower (or equal) calories than bread and burnt toast is the shittest of all.  \n\nTotal burning of the toast would definitely be lower calories though.

Our body can't create these enzymes and they can't survive in us, but they can survive in cows. That's why you hear about how celery burns more calories than it actuallly gives us, because celery is cellulose so we can't break it down and absorb anything from it without the necessary enzymes (but cows can!).",

This means that the human enzymes cannot break it down. Part of the ripening process involves breakdown of this resistant starch by the banana enzymes making it accessible. There are different things that can make a starch resistant. In this case the green banana starch is a type 2 resistant starch, which has a different crystal structure than the ones humans can break down easily such as wheat and corn starch. \n\nNow this doesn't mean you don't get any calories from this starch. There are bacteria in our colon that are capable of breaking it down and they ferment it, predominantly to short chain fatty acids. These can be used as an energy source by your colon cells. In fact it is estimated that about 10% of our calories come from these bacterial fermentation products.",

Unlike the sweet dessert bananas, plantains are a staple food which is fried, baked , boiled (and then sometimes pounded) or roasted, and consumed alone or together with other food.\n\nThe linked document includes a lot of additional description about how plantains differ and are distinct from other types of bananas, both in the fruit and in how the plant itself grows\n\nIt's a bit like domestic apples, they're all apples *Malus pumila*, but there are distinct subsets within orchard apples that are recognized; no-one is ever going to try to claim that an Arkansas Black is the same thing as a Granny Smith, even though that is *technically* true.  The banana/plantain thing is actually more convoluted than that example because bananas are more diverse and three major species make up the cultivated banana group rather than a single species as in the cultivated apple group.  Plantains specifically are part of the triploid cultivar of *Musa paradisiaca* ([the AAB group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_banana_cultivars#AAB_Group)), but there are edible cultivars of *Musa acuminata* and *Musa balbisiana* (not many of the latter) with di-, tri-, and tetraploid variations of each.\n\nIn short, there *is* a recognized difference between the plantain subset of bananas and the rest of the bananas, one that is recognized botanically and in cultivation, one that refers to a specific subset of the banana family.  Now, in *culinary* settings the term plantain is used more casually, but even there it's often used to specifically refer to specific types, not just any green banana.  I encourage you to visit some of the parts of the world where bananas are a staple food, try some, and talk with the folks there.\n\nAlso, thanks for making me look this info up, it's taught me a few things about bananas that I didn't know before.\n\n\nEDIT: missing letters and a missing/clarifying word \"edible\"",

You can get the same amount of energy from a grown banana at most stages of ripeness.\n\nAs the banana ripens, long and branching chains of sugars break apart, leaving more chains that are shorter, allowing your body to digest them using enzymes that can \"eat\" from each end, meaning the whole thing is converted into usable sugar more quickly. Your digestive system still contains the enzymes to break down the more complex carbohydrates, there are just fewer \"starting points\"",

This is indigestible by us, only being digested by bacteria in our large intestine. The bacteria release short chain fatty acids  like butyric acid as a result, which we can absorb very easily. This fermentation process is similar to how ruminants digest grass. As the bananas and plantains ripen, this resistant starch breaks down into simple sugars that are digestible by the small intestine. This means no SCFAs and therefore would suggest there is at least some difference in net calories.",

You can measure it by taking a piece of food and putting it into a bomb calorimeter, incinerating it, and measuring how much energy is released. So if you burned a piece of toast, you've already already burnt it and released its energy. Therefore your number of calories in the toast is less than the original amount of calories in the unburnt toast.  \n\nAny answer that talks about digestion is completely incorrect, which is why calories are such a controversial measure for food energy. It doesn't take into account digestibility.  To make calorie counting work, you should also be measuring the amounts of material you excrete and incinerating it to see how much unused calories have just gone through your system.  Even then you're missing the fact that some calories in food are more difficult for your body to process and consume more energy to digest.\n\nSo by burning the toast, you have reduced its calories by definition.",

Lightly toasted has more.\n\nGenerally cooking food slightly increases its calories which is why cooking was a useful invention for us.\n\nIt's also why we've been doing it long enough to have evolved to have less tolerance for raw meat and a better time processing cooked foods.\n\nPart of the energy you gain from food gets spent processing raw foods. If it's cooked, your digestive system has less work to do. Less calories spent, higher net caloric intake from the food.\n\nI don't know how much the difference is but I can inhale a medium rare ribeye. But if I eat the ribeye raw, as I often do (merely buying from a butcher, removing the paper, seasoning and eating raw) it takes me a lot longer and by the end my jaw is extremely tired etc. That's to say nothing of the extra internal digestion that must occur.",

Sadly, this 2 century old method of burning food to determine calories is still used, even though most people digest their food with chemicals, not fire.",

I believe there are things, like wood and coal to name obvious substances that burn but nonetheless have no actual calories in the sense that a human eating them would get no energy or weight gain from doing so.",

            "comment": "This, i feel qualified to answer. \n\nThe burnt part of the toast is literally burnt. So, that is fuel spent. \n\nWe measure calories as the amount of heat generated when we burn some thing like, say, toast. \n\nIf that blackened part of the bread is present, then that means fuel was spend to generate a black layer of carbon. \nThat means less calories for some one to take in. And, we can't use carbon as food. It passes right through us in small quantities. \n\nIts not a very elegant way to say it, but what i said is true. I'd speculate its likely a negligible amount of calories lost, though. Now maybe a nutritionist or chemist can comment about how much caloric loss actually occurs. ",

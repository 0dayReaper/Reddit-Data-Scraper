    "postText": "I'm a pescatarian, so I eat a lot of seafood. Of course, most seafood contains mercury thanks to methylmercury absorption by plankton/fish which are subsequently eaten by predatory fish (bioaccumulation). Most of the time, the mercury content won't have an impact on humans. However, humans start suffering from the mercury content once they consume too many \"apex fish predators\" (sharks, baraccuda, tuna, etc).\n\nThose predatory fish, especially sharks, don't suffer from mercury poisoning despite their high mercury consumption. \n\nI know our biology isn't the same as fish, but why is it that we can't build up a resistance to mercury (or other heavy metals) to the same degree as predatory fish? I've heard it might be possible (the Japanese have been eating seafood heavy diets for tens of thousands of years), but it seems as if we can only \"evolve\" so much in this regard. I'd imagine if anyone could build up an exceptional tolerance, it would probably be East Asians or Polynesians  considering they've been eating predatory fish for longer than anyone else...but their mercury tolerance doesn't seem that much higher than anyone else's.",

It's speculated that sharks have a mechanism that protects them from mercury and other toxins but we just don't know\n\n&gt;the Japanese have been eating seafood heavy diets for tens of thousands of years\n\nThere wasn't as much mercury in the sea until humans started emitting it on an industrial scale. there are other toxins that weren't even present until humans started putting them in the environment.\n\n&gt;but why is it that we can't build up a resistance to mercury (or other heavy metals) to the same degree as predatory fish?\n\nPredatory fish have been living with volcanic mercury build up forever, humans have a more limited exposure.  These days the fish born without sufficient resistance probably all die young, but fish are mostly r reproducers, if toxins kill of some of their spawn it just means better odds of survival for the rest.  I guess if we continue to poison our environment to the point it kills everyone without resistance before they reproduce we will develop our own resistance or go extinct.\n\nMercury and a few other toxins found in fish are accumulation poisons.  You generally build up a tolerance to poisons by Mithridatism, surviving non-lethal doses, slowly increasing the amount over time until you can survive lethal doses.  This generally only works with complex biological poisons the immune system can respond to.  It absolutely cannot work with an accumulation poisons as non-lethal doses will just stay in your body and eventually build up to a lethal dose.",

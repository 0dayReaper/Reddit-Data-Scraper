            "comment": "Platelet activation is a process that involves changes in the shape, function and surface of platelets. Platelet activation can be triggered by different factors, such as collagen, thrombin, ADP, TXA2 and vWF. When platelets are activated, they release the contents of their granules, including the dense granules, to attract more platelets and form a plug at the site of injury. The release of dense granules also enhances the coagulation cascade, which stabilizes the platelet plug with fibrin.\n\nHypotension from spinal anesthesia can cause platelet activation by several mechanisms. One possible mechanism is that hypotension reduces the blood flow and oxygen delivery to the platelets, which makes them more sensitive to activating signals. Another possible mechanism is that hypotension activates the sympathetic nervous system, which releases catecholamines (such as adrenaline) that can stimulate platelet receptors and increase intracellular calcium levels. A third possible mechanism is that hypotension induces inflammation and oxidative stress, which can increase the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) that can modulate platelet function.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482478/",

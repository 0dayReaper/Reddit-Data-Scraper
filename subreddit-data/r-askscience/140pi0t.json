            "comment": "Because it forms bridges between the grains that make it stick together.\n\nThe optimal dampness depends on the type of sand and how tightly it is packed:\n\n - fine sand can hold more water than coarse sand, but it also tends to be more slippery and less stable\n\n - coarse sand can drain water more quickly, but it also leaves more gaps between the grains that make it weaker\n\nA good way to test the dampness of the sand is to squeeze a handful of it and see if it holds its shape or falls apart.",

            "comment": "The Sand grains have pore spaces between them, and because of capillary action, the water wants to fill up those pose spaces. You've also probably noticed that water likes to stick together, that's because it has high intermolecular forces, but it also has high intramolecular forces, which makes it stick to other things, this is why if you put water in a test tube the miniscus will be convex as the water tried to stick to the walls of the test tube. This is why water wanted to fill in those pose spaces, because it wasn't to stick to the sides of the sand grains. The more surface area in the sand grains, the more forces from the water that will be holding it together, which is why it only works it the sand is fine enough, but it there is too much water it will fall apart because the sand grains will be able to move around, and the water will be able to flow because the intermolecular forces are no longer strong enough to overcome gravity",

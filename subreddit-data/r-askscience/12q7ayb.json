Bacterial cells have \u201cwalls\u201dof peptidoglycans that surround the lipid membrane. In order for the viral DNA to enter a bacterium, the virus has to \u201cpunch: through the cell wall to allow the DNA to enter the cell.",

And I realize these tailless phages infect *E. coli* which does not have the thick cell wall. Do you know if the tailed vs. tailless morphology is indeed determined by the presence of the host cell wall?",

                    "comment": "Thank you - that makes it clear why these phages need tails. That got me curious about plant viruses; they seem to mostly be spherical or rod shaped without tails (like the tobacco mosaic virus), yet they also have to contend with a tough cell wall. It looks like a lot of plant viruses depend on insects to create wounds through which they can enter; I don't see anything like the injection system used by some phages.\n\nI'm even more curious now about diatom viruses! A silica wall must really help keep the viruses at bay, but there are indeed diatom viruses.\n\nAnyway, thank you for your answer - cheers!",

I don\u2019t know much about plant and diatom viruses. Interestingly, using phages to treat antibiotic resistant infections has saved lives when nothing else worked - this is very cutting edge with mainly case reports. Further study is needed. You are correct in that plant viruses enter via breaks and tears in leaves or whatnot caused by insects, birds etc. Oh, and since the most soothing sound a doc may hear is the sound of his or her own voice (sorry, i just can\u2019t seem to shut up when I\u2019m on a rollj  here is an odd tidbit: approximately eight percent of the human genome is composed of ancient retroviruses that got inserted into germline cell\u2019s DNA and was subsequently passed along\u2026 and apparently some of them influence the expression of other genes and thus now serve a useful purpose\u2026",

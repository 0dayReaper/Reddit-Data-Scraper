Happens all the time with bacterial taxonomy, as morphology really does not do a good job (the whole concept of a species doesn't even really work for bacteria, but that's another rant).",

            "comment": "It already has, like you pointed out. However, morphology is not an obsolete way of classification. Many synapomorphies indicate actual lineages. For example vertebrates are a very solid classification because developing a spinal cord is a hard thing to do so it is highly unlikely that any animal we come across with a spine isn't actually descended from vertebrates. Your example of carcinization is a good one though, and many body forms tend towards what works best even in different lineages. Biologists are pretty smart however, so even before genetics they would seek out highly specific identifiers to try and keep lineages consistent. For example many dinosaur species look similar and developed similar strategies, so the classification used is based on the hips which is harder to change and even when it does, there are often remnants that will be present in one lineage but not the other. And the more broad the taxonomic group the more likely it is to remain as the separations are larger differences.",

            "comment": "It is indes is an ever changing system of classifications. You do not even need genetics to come along to change it. Taxonomists disagree about the relevance of certain morphological characters and several species are often described as new species although they have already been described some 100 years ago. Several species have had &gt;10 different names since Linn\u00e9. Lastly all classification levels except for the species level are 100% arbitrary. So there is a lot of room for declaring some lineage as a \"new family\". My point is that the system is anything but set in stone even without genetics.",

Most biologists will probably* acknowledge that the biological species concept (where species are populations that cannot create fertile offspring between each other) is the gold standard, but 99.9/100 you cant directly test kr prove this. So we use other information as a proxy (how different do they look? How geographically isolated are they? How divergent is their DNA? But different data (eg morphology might *look* the same while molecular/dna says otherwise) and can give you different results/answers. There are more than 30 different ways that are proposed to define what a \u201cspecies\u201d is - some more robust than others. DNA has revolutionized the field as we can make assumptions about how fast it mutated and estimate ages of divergence between species etc, and has rewritten a lot of what we thought we knew based on morphology etc. But it\u2019s not foolproof, has its own issues, and its always best to try to consider multiple types/lines of data together \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb",

            "comment": "This has pretty much already happened.  Genes have been heavily used for taxonomy for decades now (I think the very first genetic phylogeny was in the 70's), and have already had really big impacts on how taxonomy is structured.  A lot of phylogenetic trees were reshuffled in the late 90's.  The process hasn't _finished_ yet, especially where taxonomy is really difficult (like pinning down the relationships of the earliest animals, or distinguishing between groups that diverged very quickly in sequence a long time ago), so some changes will still happen.  But taxonomy has already been changed.  However, it turns out that a lot of guesses based on morphology were right after all (but some were very wrong).  \n\nIt's _definitely_ not too ingrained to change, phylogeneticists are constantly reshuffling the tree of life to suit their ideas about relationships between species, sometimes to the exasperation of everyone else who just wants to have a consistent name for whatever organism they are talking about.  \n\nFor an example of reshuffling due to genetics, check out [this paper from 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC34321/) and in particular Fig 1, which shows the \"old\" phylogeny of animal groups and the \"new\" phylogeny of animal groups (granted, it was new 23 years ago!).  The \"new\" tree is still more or less what we use today, but there's still a lot of debate going on about some parts, and we have better details about other parts.\n\nAnd here's a good blog post detailing the reshuffling of the mammal phylogenetic tree that took place in the late 90's due to the impact of genetic research...with lots of illustrations, too\n\nhttps://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/refined-fine-tuned-placental-mammal-family-tree/\n\nIt also points out some important things to note...1) many of the \"newly discovered\" groups had actually been proposed much earlier on the basis of anatomy, it's just that other groupings had been considered better.  2) many of the relationships weren't actually changed.  The old trees had things wrong, but they also had things right.  \n\n\nOf course, genetics doesn't solve everything. In particular, old fossils don't have any genetic material remaining.\n\nAlso, side note, these days the consensus is that all bats _are_ closely related, and genetics helped confirm this.",

            "comment": "Digging deep into my microbiology/genetics lectures for this one... If I remember corectly, it is very much still in flux. Zoologists/microbiologis and genetics have a lot of beef over this topic. Listening to their arguments can be extremly funny.\n\nThe current system is mostly based on morphology, genetics is just too new. Microbes are especialy hard to place, as you can only differentiate spheres so much. What we are looking at from a genetic aproach are the highly conserved parts of our dna to reconstruct phylogenetic trees. Those are the parts that cant be lived without, like histones, which are practically identical from human to cow to grass.\n\nSpecificaly ribosomes are a great way to compare living things to one another, using svedberg or sequence.\n\nAs you can imagine depending on what you compare you will get different answers. Some genes are more important, and thus higher conserved, compared to other organisms. This leads to a wonderfull chaos on the subspecies level, where the genetic code of e.g. Bacillus subtilis subspecies spizizenii overlapes with inaquosorum (or one of the other 266 species in its genus).\n\nIt comes down to where you draw the line between a new species or just a variant due to mutation/genetic modification.",

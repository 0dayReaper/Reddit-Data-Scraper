            "comment": "The idea of a species is not cut and dry. The most common definition of a species is a set of animals that can breed and make fertile offspring. However, if you have asexual organisms or you\u2019re looking at a fossil record this definition is not very useful. According to Wikipedia there are 26 different definitions of species concept in use, including definitions based on morphology, genetics, location, breeding patterns, and various other things.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_concept",

The terms are leftovers from early scientific research into the subject before people figured out how complicated it was and still thought everything could be fit in neat boxes. \"Species\" as a term is older than the concept of Darwinian evolution, so a lot of the people who used it originally still thought each species was created separately from everything else by God or other intelegant design. Biology irl is a complicated mess.\n\nFor things like canines specifically, theres some examples. Wolves and dogs can and do breed if left in proximity to each other, and the offspring are fertile and can breed back into ether population. Wolves and Coyotes can also breed and produce fertile offspring, but their mating behaviors are different enough that it's rare. Dogs and coyotes have behaviors so different that interbreeding almost never happens, and the offspring are usually infertile. So dogs and wolves can kind of be considered the same species, wolves and coyotes are verry close but kept apart by behavior, and coyotes and dogs are definitely not the same thing.",

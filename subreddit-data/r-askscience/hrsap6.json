    "title": "COVID-19 started with one person getting infected and spread globally: doesn't that mean that as long as there's at least one person infected, there is always the risk of it spiking again? Even if only one person in America is infected, can't that person be the catalyst for another epidemic?",

            "comment": "You're on the right track, but as always, it's more complicated than that.\n\nFor starters, COVID may not have necessarily started from a patient X, it could have been a group of people.  Not sure if we know that for certain, but that's besides the point.  You're right in thinking that as long as someone has it, they can still transmit it to other people, but then we get into ideas like herd immunity and how COVID-19 exists in the environment.\n\nFor starters, herd immunity is the idea that so many people have had an immune response to a specific virus that if it were to become prevalent again in a specific community, it would not lead to an epidemic, because only a few people would likely show symptoms when contracting it, if any.  As others here have said, we are no where near that yet, that would likely take a few years to reach, especially here in the US.  Even so, this does not mean it can't infect people, there are always those who cannot receive vaccines due to a weakened immune system, hence the idea of herd immunity and actually being smart enough to get your vaccines to protect those who can't.\n\nSecondly, we aren't sure how long our antibodies will last for this strain of COVID, much less if COVID has, or could, mutate enough to where the antibodies wouldn't be effective in fighting it off.  Certain diseases, like tetanus, we receive a vaccine for over certain intervals of time, this is could be due to a number of factors, one of which is that some antibodies are not forever, they vary on their length of effectiveness, or memory, within the body.  Another possible factor for other diseases is that the disease is so potent that we are only able to use dead forms of the microbe (or various other methods of making vaccines) in the vaccine which doesn't elicit as strong as an immune response as a weakened form would cause.  The strongest response your body will have in fighting off a disease in the future is to actually become infected, and sick.  This is obviously not what we want, but a similar magnitude of response often occurs because of many vaccines.  As mentioned above, mutations could also become an issue.  The reason why there is a new flu vaccine every year is because it mutates so rapidly.  In fact, the vaccine you get is an \"estimate\" of what scientists believe the flu may look like that year, so it could be entirely ineffective, or pretty spot-on.  Even so, sometimes the antibodies we have work against infectious organisms that aren't exactly what they were made for, but still work to some degree.  Effectiveness of this topic is somewhat controversial.\n\nFinally, sometimes it's not possible to eradicate something entirely, because it still exists in the environment.  COVID-19 supposedly started in bats, then mutated to be able to infect humans, that means that even though we could potentially reach a point where humans aren't being effected by it, it could still cause problems in other animals.  There are serious consequences that could result from this as well, not even considering the fact that transmitting from 1 species to another indicates that it does have the ability to mutate into a new strain, and COVID-21 or something could eventually become a result of that.\n\nTL;DR - Yes",

Coronaviruses in particular contain proofreading encoding in their RNA which reduces the number of mutations. \n\nI think influenza not only is more prone to errors in replication (direct mutations) but is unique in being able to combine parts with other strains and create new variants, even without traditional mutation (Though I'm not well versed on this topic)",

A species like the wolverine tends to be solitary.  They can go months without seeing another wolverine.  If they developed wolverine Ebola, they'd probably just die all alone out in the wilderness somewhere, and the new virus would die with them.\n\nAnother reason it seems that so many human diseases come from bats is they are so diverse.  There are thousands of different of species of bats.  They make up about 40% of the described species of mammals.  So it makes sense that 40% of the zoonotic diseases originate in bats.",

This allows the viral load in each animal to become very high. This high viral load is conducive to said virus trying to jump to another host that isn't as inundated so it can do its job and spread.",

Their body temp is higher than our fever temp so our primary immune response isn't as effective against diseases that evolved in bats.  Also, large communities give viruses more chance to mutate and possibly jump.\n \nThe vampire story may have originated with rabies, which bats can carry.  People bitten by bats often went \"crazy\"... They feared water (vampires aren't supposed to be able to cross water) and strong smells like garlic caused a strong reaction.  They shied away from people and many probably went off to die on their own.",

So they can easily move viruses around the world. Birds also do this, but are more different biologically from us, so it's harder for a virus to make the jump. Also, bats can and do live in fairly close proximity to humans more so than many other animals.",

The herd immunity threshold (HIT) is reached when the R(t) of a pathogen drops below 1 and therefore any new outbreak will tend to dwindle rapidly rather than spread exponentially.\n\nThere is a commonly quoted equation for HIT: fraction of population = (R0-1)/R0, and for something like coronavirus which empirically has an R0 around 2.5, that comes to 60%. However, that HIT equation is derived based on the assumption that individuals within that population group all have an equal frequency of contact with other people. In reality, this is very far from true; there is enormous variance in contact frequency. Under normal circumstances, I probably come face to face with maybe 15 or 20 people per day, but a cashier or bank teller may instead come face to face with 100s. Conversely, there is a subset of the population that has scarcely any face to face contact. Herd immunity is highly sensitive to this distribution, because the people most able to spread a pathogen are also the most likely to catch it and consequently, immunity advances most rapidly through the most infectious among the population,causing R(t) to drop far more sharply than it would if contact frequency were homogenously distributed.   \n\nA number of researchers have estimated HIT for coronavirus as likely to occur at around 15%-20%, but this is highly sensitive to assumptions about the distribution of contact frequency, and is also strongly affected by social distancing / lockdown measures. I've done my own modeling which puts it at around 40% but again, it's highly contingent on a set of assumptions.",

Even fairly half assed efforts - partial mask adherence, no large indoor events, some attempt at physical distancing - seems to drop that value, so combining that with some smaller immune fraction of the population may be enough to get r below 1. In fact it's hard not to wonder if this is what we're seeing now in New York.",

            "comment": "Possibly, but the difference between the hypothetical that you're suggesting and how this started is knowledge of it happening. When the first person became infectious, no one had any idea, it spread, those people spread it, and no one even knew there was a disease going around until symptoms started appearing possibly up to two weeks later, and even then it wasn't clear it was anything more than a cold until people started needing hospitalization.\n\nNow, we know that this is going on, if we managed to contain and treat and contact trace people until we got to a point where only one person was left who had it, things would be different. Just to get to that point our behavior would have had to change to limit the spread, and while we may have relaxed from that at that point, enough would probably still be in place for this person to avoid spreading it. In fact, contact tracing would likely be necessary to get to this point, so even before a positive test result was received, they likely would know this person had likely caught it, and with the number of people infected being very low at this hypothetical point, we'd have the resources available to quarantine them until they were deemed no longer infectious.\n\nSo basically, now that we have a better idea of what we're dealing with and how seriously we need to take it, if we get our numbers low enough we can focus on isolating the few people who still have it until they've fought it off. The reason we can't do that right now is because the number of infected and possibly infected people is so high that it would be impossible to complete isolate them all, especially since many will require treatment to survive.",

How do they proceed forward from there though? If they completely lift lockdown restrictions, aren't they at the same point they were at the start of the pandemonic when cases were equally low? \n\nI think this drives at the underlying question that OP is asking, and I don't personally know the full answer. How have Italy and other countries that had a significant population of infected managed to keep the spread low while also reducing restrictions? I'm guessing the answer is mostly through testing and contact tracing, allowing them to limit exponential spread? (Paired, of course, with continued additional precautions like working from home, wearing masks, and increased sanitization.)\n\nI've heard a lot of people discuss the fact that \"flattening the curve\" was all about keeping the infection rate low enough so that hospitals weren't overwhelmed. They're quick to point out that the virus was still expected to spread through the population, just at a more manageable rate. Assuming an effective vaccine isn't made soon and barring *permanent* restrictions like closures and masks, isn't the virus just going to continue spreading?",

If 1 infected person infects less than one person on average, cases decrease.\n\nThe reproduction rate depends in a lot of factors, some of which are inherent in the type of virus and how it spreads. Others are in how we behave.\n\nThe strict lockdown in Italy and Spain for example, were means of influencing that *r* value by altering our behavior.  The lockdown in a Italy and Spain was very strict, and quickly brought the *r* number very low, so they quickly went from many cases to few cases as cases were resolved (people recovered\u2026 or didn't).\n\nHowever, there are other behaviors that effect the *r* value.  This is where hand washing, physical distancing, masks, contact tracing etc. come into play.  All of these behaviors *reduce* the chance that the disease will be transmitted. They don't have to be perfectly effective, they just have to keep that *r* value low, below 1.\n\nIdeally, like New Zealand you eventually eliminate all cases, although you need to assume the cases will be reseeded at some point from a country still experiencing an outbreak. If you are able to catch it early though, like say in Taiwan you can stop an outbreak through more targeted measures rather than a widespread and strict lockdown.\n\nCooperation and compliance are important factors though.  Hence \"We are all in this together\".  Even if you are doing everything right, if I'm being careless, I can still catch and transmit the disease, meaning *you* are still at risk, and this all drags out longer.  However your efforts also reduce my risk.  So any marginal improvement in compliance is beneficial.\n\nIf you want to get a more in depth perspective, In recommend taking a series of [articles from Thomas Pueyo](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-the-hammer-and-the-dance-be9337092b56).  He calls these two tactics the Hammer and the Dance.

In either case we now know that many countries can identify and contain single clusters through tracking and quarantine.  A single person with smallpox would be rapidly identified and quarantined.  Those they had contact with would be quarantined.  Smallpox would be contained unless massively spread throughout a country to many many people before people could react (assuming we had responsible people instituting epidemiological control.  China has 1.5 billion people and are essentially covid free.  There are still outbreaks but they are swiftly quarantined and a recent 100 person outbreak near Beijing caused Beijing to shut down for a few weeks and 500k people were tested as a a canvassing measure.  Everyone wears masks and the Covid-19 virus is demonstrably controllable.  The US just shit the bed because we have weak leadership, selfish anti-expert self important and self educated people using misinformation to make decisions they aren\u2019t qualified to make and a government to weak to enforce the necessary changes to deal with a pandemic.  I can go into a lot more detail and give primary sources to back up points you don\u2019t agree with (I\u2019m a bio PhD candidate and have close contact with epidemiologists high in the world, country, and state levels...  I listened to them, their predictions made in January were all right, and have continued to be accurate).  Most that has occurred could be foreseen 6 months ago.  But the people with the power to influence the US outbreak have not done what\u2019s necessary in most states... and none have done it as long as necessary...",

I just find it odd that no other sicknesses have been treated like this.. like ticks and mosquitos.. it\u2019s odd we haven\u2019t had quarantined zones for limes disease and other things like that. I honestly like wearing the mask to cut down on just getting normal everyday germs from people, people are disgusting..the whole covid thing is an eye opener to a lot not just covid",

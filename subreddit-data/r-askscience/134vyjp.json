Spouses often have similar lifestyles and other risk factors, which could explain why a spouse dying is associated with greater risk of death within the 9-year follow-up.\n\nThe studies referenced in the excerpt above are more intriguing, since they (according to the summary in the linked paper) show an especially highly elevated risk of death in the immediate 3 months after a spouse's death. But I haven't dug into those and can't comment on how credible they are.",

[In the US](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html), a man age 80 has about a 6.6% chance of dying in the next year, or a 0.55% chance of dying within a month.\n\nGiven that the average 80-year-old man has a 1-in-180 chance of dying in the next month, we should expect to find many cases of elderly men dying within a month of their spouse's deaths, even if grief has no effect on risk of mortality.\n\nThere are 330 million people in the US, and 8 billion in the whole world. Much more unlikely things happen all the time.",

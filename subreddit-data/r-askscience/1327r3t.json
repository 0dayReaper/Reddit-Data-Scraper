Things like nutrition deficits will apply across the board to sperm cells and the loss should stay nearly even at scale.\n\nShort of it is, if you've got an imbalance, you're getting blasted out of an airlock because that's sus (on a serious point, you would need to consult with a myriad of physicians - you're looking at anything from germ-cell cancer to very serious defects that cross the phylogenetic tree and your embryo just plain rolled a Nat-1).",

            "comment": "To start with, yes, Chicxulub sized impactors are common enough (on a geologic time scale) that we generally need to start looking for what made the Chicxulub impact special. Specifically, on average, Chicxulub sized impactors would be expected to hit Earth every 30-100 Myrs - with the 30 Myr recurrence end of the range probably more likely than the 100 Myr recurrence (e.g., [Grieve &amp; Shoemaker, 1994](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=xXWZolI9NkUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA417&amp;ots=13R_A4bG_p&amp;sig=UEFLjK_DgT1tS27BmgV7k12sAtk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)), but there are not mass extinctions on the scale of the K-Pg with the same average rate of occurrence. The \"specialness\" of Chicxulub could be one of two things (or some combination of both):\n\n1. **Location:** As discussed by [Kaiho &amp; Oshima, 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14199-x), there's a broad idea that much of the ecological devastation caused by the Chicxulub impact came down to the rocks it hit, specifically a sulfur rich carbonate platform. At the time of impact, only ~13% of the Earth's surface contained similar rocks, so it's possible there would not have been an extinction if the Chicxulub impactor had hit any of the other 87% of the Earth surface. This also means that when considering the probability of an impact causing an extinction, we need to factor not just recurrence of a given sized impact, but also recurrence of a given sized impact hitting the right type of rocks. The role of location of the impact is considered more fully in this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/kpg_impact_location/).\n2. **Coincidence with Flood Basalts:** There's generally a vigorous debate about whether the impact or Deccan Traps volcanism was more important in the K-Pg extinction. This is discussed in more detail in another one of our [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/k_pg_extinction_cause/), but one things that comes out of this is that there's a long-standing idea (bolstered by recent results) that neither the Deccan Traps or the Chicxulub impact were sufficient on their own to cause the extinction, but together, they could (e.g., [Petersen et al., 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms12079)). Thus, again, considering the probability, we have to think not just about the recurrence interval of a Chicxulub sized impactor, but the probability of a Chicxulub sized impactor hitting while a flood basalt is erupting (e.g., [White &amp; Saunders, 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002449370400310X)).\n\nIf we take both arguments at face value, we can start to see that even with a Chicxulub sized impact every 30 million years, in order for such an impact to actually cause a mass extinction it needs to potentially hit the right spot on Earth *and* at the same time as other climatic disruptions, like the eruptions of large igneous provinces. The probabilities (and thus expected average recurrence) of all of those together are significantly lower (i.e., longer average recurrence) than just the probability of a Chicxulub sized impactor hitting Earth.",

That makes it easier to spot, since we pay a lot of attention to near-Earth objects. \n\nMost comets have extremely elliptical orbits, which means they'd be moving super fast when they cross Earth's orbit, and they're more likely to have orbits outside of the ecliptic plane. They're also made of dusty ice, which doesn't reflect much light, making them difficult to see except when they're very close to the sun. That means a comet could come from pretty much anywhere, it would be very hard to see unless it gets close enough to the sun to make a trail, and it could have a long enough orbital period that we've simply never had an opportunity to observe it before.",

There was equipment launched that wasn't used to impact and there's an economy of scale to launch a bigger impactor mass. There's a limit to that obviously, but the DART impact was only 610kg, we can absolutely double the mass without doubling the size of the rockets. For e.g. the Falcon Heavy can carry 4.2x more payload to Mars transfer orbit than the Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket that launched DART, Falcon Heavy is 2.6x heavier than the other rocket.\n\n3. Mass of the impactor isn't the end-all be-all. The kinetic energy (and how efficiently that energy is transferred) is. The DART impactor was going at 7.9 km/s to generate a 19GJ impact. If we manage to increase the speed of the exact same impactor by 41%, then we'd double the energy delivered. [edit: I mistakenly used speed of the Deep Impact probe, the actual speed of the DART impact was 6 km/s and I read later that at the time of impact DART weighed 500kg, which means it actually had 9 GJ of kinetic energy at impact, but the speed increase of 41% remains the same to double the kinetic energy]\n\nAll of that is gross simplifications, the point is that your estimate of a requirement of ~300k times the mass to impact is off by at least 1, probably 2 and possibly 3 full orders of magnitude. \n\nFYI nuking the object pretty much guarantees a meteor shower with probably thousands of them reaching ground.

For starters, we don't need to impart the same deflection/deceleration. Second, DART revealed that the amount of ejecta affects the trajectory more than the impact itself. Presumably, IDK the physics behind that, the amount and speed of ejecta isn't proportional with the mass of impactor.\n\n&gt; The chance that a debris object hits Earth is tiny. In the unlikely case that one is on a collision course it could get deflected by a follow-up mission.\n\nYou understand that we're not going to nuke such a large asteroid to the point that it misses the earth by millions of km, right? Tens of thousands of km would be good enough, but we'd probably aim - if we even can do it - for hundreds of thousands of km to be safer. Using nukes would produce thousands of 1m+ sized boulders/asteroids and they all have a similar trajectory, spread apart by a few km in the best case scenario ([they possibly have time to clump back up together](https://youtu.be/4Wrc4fHSCpw?t=888)).",

Increasing the impact velocity by 41% is a big deal in terms of rocketry, for just a factor sqrt(2) in direct momentum and a factor 2 in energy (which doesn't necessarily increase the deflection by a factor 2). Of course we could be lucky with the asteroid orbit and get a significantly higher impact velocity for free. Still not a big difference compared to the factor 300,000 in object mass. \n\n&gt;&gt; It's still ~300,000 times the mass, or if we are optimistic 30,000 times the mass if we get 10 times the warning time.\n\n&gt; That makes no sense at all, I've covered many reasons why.\n\nYou didn't cover any significant reason. Which is good, as arguing against orbital mechanics is doomed to fail.\n\n&gt; And you're comparing the mass of the asteroid, again: it's not directly comparable to the number of times we would need to hit it with DART-mass impactors. For starters, we don't need to impart the same deflection/deceleration.\n\nYes, I discussed this already. The speeds are comparable, however. DART caused a ~3 mm/s change. 3 mm/s * 10 years = 1000 km, so we are in the right order of magnitude for a deflection mission. The velocity change we need will depend on the specific asteroid but the order of magnitude does not - unless we have much more warning time, as discussed already.\n\n&gt; Second, DART revealed that the amount of ejecta affects the trajectory more than the impact itself.\n\nThat's already included in DART's impact analysis. That effect will depend on the target and the impactor, of course, but that's a factor of the order of 1.\n\nNothing of what you have brought up changes the main conclusion: Deflection an object with 300,000 times the mass will need a **far** larger mass in impactors if we stay with kinetic impactors as main deflection method. Do you really disagree with that conclusion? If not, what's the point of arguing about a few percent of fuel DART used and similar details?\n\n&gt; You understand that we're not going to nuke such a large asteroid to the point that it misses the earth by millions of km, right?\n\nExactly, and that is the reason we won't get objects hitting us. The main asteroid will make a very close pass and the debris kicked out by the explosion will miss us by an average of tens of millions of kilometers.\n\nThis is not a movie \"nuke it into pieces\" mission, this is a \"DART but with far more energy per spacecraft mass\" mission.\n\nDebris objects spread apart by a few kilometers after years are absurd unless they orbit each other.",

                            "comment": "&gt; now I\u2019m curious/confused on a different front: namely, how do scientists calculate the approximate frequency of Chicxulub sized impactors if there are so few similarly sized craters remaining for us to measure?\n\nTl;dr: statistics, along with a good understanding of how much data you\u2019re missing.\n\nThis is not my particular field in astronomy/astrophysics, but I am an astrophysics PhD candidate.\n\nMy guess for a first approach would be to use the number of known impacts as a lower bound on the rate, especially if those can be roughly dated (which then gives you rough timings). This could be corrected by the amount of Earth\u2019s surface that\u2019s land/that we expect to be able to find evidence for impact craters in the first place (i.e., we can probably assume we won\u2019t see a crater on the bottom of the ocean, so we can assume we miss x% of impacts).\n\nThis could also be used to set a rough upper bound, since presumably if there were a lot more we\u2019d see more craters, even if we couldn\u2019t see all of them. Then calculate how long it takes to lose evidence of an impact crater to get the rough timescale you have evidence over, and you can divide the (corrected) number of impacts by the timescale to get a rate. There are probably further refinements, but that would get you a good start and a solid basis for more sophisticated impact rate models",

The moon intercepts a great many slower traveling objects and disrupts the trajectory of others. Without erosion happening on the moon, its craters are a very credible record of each impactor.\n\nThis helps to get a better picture of how often a Chicxulub sized object passes near us, and that in turn helps us get a closer estimate on how many we can expect to actually impact Earth.",

They are thought to represent the first time the bulbous top of a mantle plume (i.e., the plume head) reaches the base of the crust. The mantle plume is essentially a columnar region of rising mantle that is hotter than surrounding mantle, and when it gets to the base of the crust it's hot enough to start melting the mantle, producing *lots* of basalt, which starts erupting, usually through series of vents. Because basalt tends to erupt effusively instead of explosively (think lava flows in Hawaii as opposed to explosions like St. Helens, Pinatubo, etc), all of this basalt is basically just forming stacks and stacks of lava flows, i.e., a giant flood of basalt.",

The most notable event linked to this extinction is the Grand Coupre, a faunal turnover where the European assemblage of native mammal were largely replaced by a mix of Asian arrival and surviving European mammals.

One of the linked [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/k_pg_extinction_cause/) from above has a variety of papers on the dating of both the Deccan Traps and the impact. Many of these papers (e.g., [Schoene et al., 2019](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aau2422) or [postprint outside of paywall](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1497969)) can show with extremely high precision that the Deccan Traps clearly pre-date the impact. More broadly, these are being dated with methodologies we understand exceedingly well (i.e., U-Pb and Ar/Ar) and in this age range we are able to get very high precision, repeatable measurements from multiple different systems.",

I.e., we have an estimate of the energy of the impact from the size of the crater, and there is a non-unique set of *velocity of impactor* x *density of impactor* x *volume of impactor* that would impart that energy (along with things like angle of impact, etc). There is some constraint on the density from the type of asteroid we think it was based on various geochemical details (and samples of similar composition meteorites) so then the velocity and radius are the free(er) variables.",

If we're considering all of Earth / solar system history, then sure, yes, impact rates since the late heavy bombardment have decreased on average.

For example, [Marzouei et al., 2019](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aar4058) suggest that impact rate has actually increased for the last ~300 million years compared to the preceding ~300 million years.",

The shockwave propagated supersonically (and asymmetrically?) and blasted the forest, which would have been of much greater extent in North America, at least, than it was in historical times, into matchsticks. Then the heat pulse arrived and millions of square miles of finely shredded organic matter flashed into flame. The airborne soot probably far exceeded that of a true nuclear winter. Nothing multi-cellular survived east of the Rockies other than a few small species of amphibians. (Most things died west of the Rockies, too, but the mountains\u2019 wind shadow offered some protection from the initial destruction, if not from the subsequent climate disaster.)\n\nHad the object struck in deeper water, as would have been statistically more likely, or had it struck when atmospheric oxygen was not so elevated, as is more frequently the case, its effect on life on earth would have been less overwhelming.\n\nIIRC",

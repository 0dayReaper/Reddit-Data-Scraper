            "comment": "Metal wheels are tougher and not affected as much by the lack of atmosphere (vacuum) on the surface of mars.  It's the lack of atmosphere (vacuum) that is really the bigger deal.  Plastics tend to outgas and become brittle over time with outgassing and radiation damage (Mars has almost no atmosphere- so solar radiation is much higher than on earth).  Metal wheels simply hold up better over long periods of time than plastics would.",

Microabrasions would act as nick initiations, and the strain of flexure and contact pressure would effect crack propogation (growth) so the structural matrix would fail.  The loss of plasticizers due to the lower atmosphere (Mars has an atmosphere, but nowhere near Earths) is minor compared to the temperature extremes and unpredictable terrain the polymers would experience.    Speedy's last sentence is perfect - metal wheels simply hold up better over long periods.",

If you just divide the minimum amount of expected distance covered by Curiosity (20 km) by the circumference of its wheels (1.57 m), you come up with an expected cycle count of ~10^5. You certainly can't count on a generic aluminum alloy to retain its full strength after that many cycles, but it retains a lot of it, then perhaps more importantly, reasonable alternatives to aluminum fatigue just as quickly. If you look at an S-N plot comparing various alloys, they pretty much all decay at the same rate, including across metal families, up to about a million cycles. So if aluminum has a higher strength to weight ratio than titanium, you're not inherently going to go with titanium just because it has a better fatigue characteristic out at 10 million or 100 million cycles.",

            "comment": "To speak specifically to Curiosity, which is probably what you're thinking of, let's consult this interview with the NASA team on what the problem was with the wheels and how the wheels were designed.\n\nhttps://www.planetary.org/articles/08190630-curiosity-wheel-damage\n\nFirst, the wheels were machined from a single block of aluminum. They don't specify what the grade of aluminum was but I would suspect 7075-T6 since I've seen references to \"aerospace grade aluminum\". Given that they're almost certainly heat treated, machining from a single billet means the material is (nearly) homogeneous. Aluminum has an excellent strength to weight ratio, much better than all or essentially all engineering polymers.\n\nThe reason that the wheels of several rovers, including Curiosity, suffered unusually and unanticipated severe damage, is that like every other part of the rover they were designed to meet the desired service life in a specified operational environment and as it turned out, the operational environment on Mars was not what they thought it would be. In particular, based on the knowledge of the Martian surface at the time, engineers expected that the rover would either be transiting relatively a flat hard bedrock with at most a thin sand layer, or a sandy environment. In the former case, it would primarily ride on the metallic treads and in the latter case, the treads would provide traction in loose sand.\n\nIt turned out, though, that there was one significant feature of the Martian surface the engineers were unaware of and therefore didn't design to accommodate. This was the fact that the Martian surface includes substantial environments where there are effectively spikes firmly attached to bedrock. The rover can roll over sharp rocks without damage if those rocks are mobile. Only in the case where the rocks don't shift with the weight of the rover do they puncture the aluminum tire, and they didn't think they would encounter that situation. But they were wrong.",

[One design](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/glenn/2020/the-little-tires-that-could-go-to-mars) was specifically developed to fly on ESA's sample fetching rover in 2026. This is a non-pneumatic tire made of a mesh of nickel-titanium alloy. The job planned for that fetch rover will now be done by Perseverance, with drones as backups, so the fetch rover is cancelled. (This is in part a testament to Percy's expected longevity, aluminum ~~tires~~ wheels and all.) However, the fetch rover and/or tire design may yet see use on the Moon.\n\nIn the mean time, this [\"SMART\"](https://www.smarttirecompany.com/) metal tire design is [being applied to bikes](https://www.tomorrowsworldtoday.com/2021/12/06/nasa-smart-airless-tires-for-bikes/), and possibly other terrestrial vehicles.

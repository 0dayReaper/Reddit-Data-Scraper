    "postText": "Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science**\n\nDo you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: \"What would happen if...\", \"How will the future...\", \"If all the rules for 'X' were different...\", \"Why does my...\".\n\n**Asking Questions:**\n\nPlease post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.\n\n**Answering Questions:**\n\nPlease only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.\n\nIf you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).\n\nPast AskAnythingWednesday posts [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27meta%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).

While that is helpful to visualize, it always leaves in my mind the impression that spacetime is something other masses are *on* or *in*, like a stapler inside jello. \n\nBut I keep wondering if spacetime is also, for lack of a better word, *in* everything? Does an atom *displace* spacetime? Is spacetime between the nucleus and the electrons? Or is it also inside the nucleus? \n\nMaybe a bigger example. Is Earth *in* but *separate from* spacetime? Or is spacetime right beside me when I'm sitting in my living room?",

Trying to apply stronger fields doesn't magnetize the material more, and if you drop the external field then the field of the magnet decreases, too.

[This publication](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8903617) calculates 1.32 to 1.38 T.\n\nThe size of the magnet doesn't matter, you just scale up everything linearly in space and the field gets larger but not stronger.",

You measure their position in the sky, and then you measure again 6 months later when Earth is on the opposite side of the Sun. Twice the Sun/Earth distance is a short baseline compared to the distance to stars but angle measurements are precise. Stars move relative to the Sun so you need at least three measurements, and in practice you try to get even more to reduce uncertainties.\n\nThat method works up to ~10,000 light years or so (with a somewhat lower precision for distances beyond that). For stars farther away you use the [cosmic distance ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_distance_ladder), which uses stars with well-known behavior nearby to determine the distance of equivalent stars farther away. Objects next to these can then be used to estimate the distance of even farther objects with the same method.",

That dot could move way faster than 'c'. But it doesn't break anything- because there's still the lag you'd expect from the time you pushed the button on the laser pointer, until the dot hit the moon to begin with.",

No rocks (at the surface) are immune from weathering or erosion, but some minerals that make up rocks are less stable at surface conditions and so will not persist as sediment (sand sized or otherwise) for *too* long, though when thinking about geologic time, a *short time* can still be hundreds of thousands to millions of years. Minerals that easily dissolve in water or weak acids (e.g., halite, calcite, etc) or generally tend to react easily at surface conditions and form other minerals (e.g., olivines, pyroxenes, etc) are all components of rock that you wouldn't expect to make up large components of your average sand. But there are definitely exceptions, e.g., sand formed from the weathering of basalts can be predominantly olivine and pyroxene. It's more that all told, these are not particularly stable minerals at the surface so these don't make up much of sand on a global scale.",

The neat part of the study was separating the plastics from the blood.\n\nThere is no useful measurement for microplastics inside the human body.\n\nFor instance, they are mostly inside your gut and lungs.  Currently, to measure microplastic exposure involves taking your poop dissolving it and separating out the tiny pieces of plastic from all the food stuff.  Not easy to do, but also not very useful information.\n\nWe think you have about 100,000 plastic microparticles enter your body everyday.  The plastic particles are only about 4% of all the total microparticles per day you are exposed to, the rest mostly being \"natural\" particles of things like fine sand, dirt, biological materials etc.\n\nWhen you die, we think about only 1000 will be inside your body.  That is from autopsies, so not a lot of information but even order of magnitude it is &lt;&lt;&lt; than your daily microparticle intake.  They may be stuck in lesions in your lungs or little blister-things in your gut.  Maybe some have crossed the gut to get stuck in some organs.  But vast 99.999+% just pass through you like ghosts through a wall.\n\nEverything else - we don't know.  We don't know if they are neutral guests along for a ride and doing nothing, if they do anything \"good\" or anything \"bad\", if they are correlated with anything.  That's an important question: the old prove it doesn't hurt me versus prove it is safe.  There are lots of natural things we haven't proved are safe, but we also haven't found anything harmful either.\n\nThe conclusion of the linked article is keen to point out that they don't know if the particles are floating in your blood or carried inside cells.  They don't know the fate of the particles.  They have no way to link blood numbers to any sort of health outcomes or even to ongoing monitoring.",

It would still take 32 000 of those hypothetic plants to cancel out the world's CO2 emissions for 2021 (32 billion tons), not accounting for CO2 produced by the construction of those plants and most importantly not accounting for the CO2 produced  by the energy needed to capture and store this CO2.     \nAlso, those plants requires chemicals which may be a problem in itself.\n\nIt takes about 10Giga joules per ton of CO2 to treat and store the CO2.   \nSo, based on the 32 billion tons of CO2 figure, it would take 320 billion gigajoules to treat all the CO2 emitted by other sources.  \nThat's about \\~89 000 terawatt-hours, which is about 3 to 4 times the total consumption of electricity of the entire world in a year.   \n\n\nSo... nope.",

It will be something like 1-4% of the gas in a given gas well, but can be up to 10% of the gas well by volume.  Before they put it in the pipeline and send natural gas to your house, they separate out all the other gases such as carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen, and helium.\n\nWhat USA government used to do was require the few giant mega gas producers to separate the helium and send it to a central facility.  Now that gas producing regions have relocated and split into multiple smaller units it is no longer financial sense to do the separation and transport.\n\nUnfortunately, helium is still really cheap.  It's only $7 cubic meter!  It is not worth the cost of running the separator and a bottling plant just for helium.  Instead, it gets released to the atmosphere.\n\nFuture developments include the price of helium increasing to the point it does make financial sense to separate helium from smaller gas wells.  Also, potentially direct helium mining.  There are some areas in the world where there are underground caverns full of concentrated helium that could be mined and captured.",

This storm is caused by \"the ocean boiling during the day, only to snap freeze 10 minutes after sunset.\" I understand it\u2019s science fiction, but it\u2019s been driving me crazy.\n\nHere is all of the information about the planet I can find:\n\nHagalaz has a radius of 6,309 km, a day length of 98.3 Earth Days with an orbital period of 1 Earth year, an atmospheric pressure of 0.83 of Earth, an average surface temperature of 72 \u00b0C (day) and \u221264 \u00b0C (night), a surface gravity of 0.69 g, and a mass of 0.67 Earth Masses. It has an orbital distance of 0.95 AU around a star with a stellar mass of 1.01 compared to our sun. It is not specified if Hagalaz\u2019s oceans are salt or fresh water, nor the temperature of the star, though it appears to be roughly half the size of our sun. Hagalaz has a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and is apparently a garden world capable of supporting life. \n\nWith all of the necessary information about the composition of the planet aside my questions are - would the storm that is supposedly spanning at least most of the circumference of the planet and constantly chasing the sunset even be possible? Would it be possible for water, any water, to boil at 72C and snap freeze in 10 minutes after sundown in these conditions? Would this planet even have any water left?",

                    "comment": "Are you talking about at the time of Earth's formation, as in, early Earth gets a magnetic field, which attracts more iron and nickel to the core as it's forming? That seems unlikely, since the [Earth's magnetic field is caused by convection currents of iron around the core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field#Physical_origin), which requires the immense heat and pressure of an entire rocky planet around it to work. (But I don't know.)\n\nAre you instead asking whether metal would be attracted to Earth since after Earth's formation through today? In short, yes. Our magnetic field has components both inward toward the core and parallel to the Earth's surface. On the surface we humans mostly can see the effects of the magnetic field as exerting a force on a compass needle. The needle is very light, carefully balanced, and shielded from the air so that there are as few additional forces involved that could overwhelm or resist that caused by Earth's magnetic field. Also, a compass needle is magnetized so that it aligns correctly and at maximum force with magnetic North. In principle a non-magnetized iron (or other ferromagnetic) needle can also be used in a compass, following recalibration. \\[See a [StackX explanation on this](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/451368/would-a-compass-with-unmagnetized-needle-work), though the answer appears to be interpreting the necessary energy as that needed to permanently magnetize a needle, as opposed to simply the Zeeman energy, which is a net gain when the sum of alignment directions of its tiny component magnetized crystals with respect the external magnetic field is calculated. Thus as long as resistance in the compass chamber is minimal, the needle should eventually align. Magnetite as [lodestone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodestone), incompletely magnetized, was used in this way.\\]\n\nNote that [in orbit the magnetic field is only about half as strong as on the surface](https://image.gsfc.nasa.gov/poetry/ask/a10015.html) (where it is already quite weak by human observation standards), and it decreases steeply further out, but low orbit is perhaps the first place where you might first think of a free unmagnetized iron or nickel (a ferromagnetic metal) object being noticeably affected by Earth's magnetic field. There's a lot of subtleties here that I'm sure I'll miss, but let's try a calculation: taking magnetic saturation into account (thanks u/mfb- ), the max magnetization of steel is 2 T, and if we have a 1 m^3 block of steel in space then that's a magnetic dipole moment of 2 A m^2, so with a magnetic field in orbit of 35 * 10^(-6) T, the forces experienced in orbit are at max 7 * 10^(-5) N. Compare this to, say, the [total drag forces in orbit](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/RoR_WWW/SWREDI/2015/SatDrag_YZheng_060415.pdf), say at ISS orbit at 400 km (p. 14) ~ .001 dynes/cm^2 * 100^2 cm^2 * 10^(-5) N/dyne = 10^(-4) N. So at most, the magnetic forces on this (unrealistically) enormous metal block in orbit would be of comparable magnitude, a bit less, than the not insignificant drag at the ISS, which is more significant than I expected *if I took into account everything needed* (which is a big \"if\").",

The uniform component of Earth's magnetic field is only changing the energy of the arrangement, the force comes from the inhomogeneity. As an order of magnitude estimate, the force will be F = B_1 V B_E / (R_E mu_0) with B_1 and B_E being the two magnetic fields, V being the volume of the steel block and R_E being the radius of Earth (as scale of the variation of Earth's magnetic field). mu_0 is the vacuum permeability.

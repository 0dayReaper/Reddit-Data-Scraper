What about the seals, did they always inhabit what is now Antarctica or did they come from somewhere else? Penguins, evidently, came from somewhere else -- why didn't another avian-like creature fill this niche?",

They really live in the ocean, shorelines are just where they nest.  And I think it's fair to say they are native to the Antarctic waters.  As for why other birds didn't move to the waters as antarctic froze, well, penguins were already there.  And they would probably not have had the right adaptations to make a living in the ocean.",

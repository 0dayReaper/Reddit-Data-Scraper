            "comment": "Simply put:  \nMint contains compounds such as menthol, which can stimulate the cold-sensitive receptors in our mouth and throat, creating a cooling sensation. Thermal nocireceptors become temporarily desensitized or activated to perceive a sensation of coldness when you eat mint.  \n=&gt; these receptors become more sensitive to cold water.",

            "comment": "The main chemical in mint gum, menthol, acts as a \"cooling agent\" that tricks your sensory   \nnerves into thinking that there's something cold in your mouth. Then,   \nwhen you do drink a glass of water, your brain thinks that this temperature is extra cold and your throat feels like you just swallowed an iceberg.",

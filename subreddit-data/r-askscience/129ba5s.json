    "postText": "What is the mathematical principle which helps any organism (like a tree or fungus) decide the general spacing between the branches originating from the main stem? The older the branches are, the further apart they will be due to extension (i think), so is it a logarithmic growth? Does the theoretical maximum length of the branch decided how further apart they will originate from the main stem? Is this length coded in the genetics of that species?",

            "comment": "Well, obviously there are genetic features arising from iteration via evolutionary processes that make those things happen.\n\n There is a mathematical concept, the Fibonacci sequence, which just so happens to reflect the branching of various creatures, among many, many other things it is connected with, and it is worth looking into that more if you are interested in it, but its important to understand that the Fibonacci sequence doesn't DECIDE anything. It just so happens to line up with certain natural phenomena, rather than having been conceptualised in order to describe them, and it's the genetics that actually decides how living things and their systems form.",

            "comment": "Look at a twig or seedling. Each splitting point, including the ones where one of the two resulting twigs/sticks is gone so there's just an angle left, is called a \"node\". The distance between nodes is called the \"internode length\". Internode length is genetic and varies between species, and can vary within a species or even an individual, but is never more than a few inches. And the splitting at every node is where future branches come from because every little stick poking out from any node anywhere is a potential future branch.\n\nTree trunks end up with branches multiple feet apart because most of those potential branches from years before died or got cut off or dropped, and did not end up as an actual branch today. For example, if a sapling's stem had an average internode length of 2 inches years ago, and its trunk has branches 3 feet apart today, then only 1 in 18 of those nodes produced a branch that's still there. The other 17 potential branches fell off or got broken off or such at one time or another along the way, and those nodes simply ended up as part of the trunk as you see it today. So you can think of a 3-foot span of trunk between two branches on that tree as a stack of 18 original 2-inch internodes that have merged together.\n\nThe ratio of \"surviving\" ones to \"lost\" ones is a response to circumstances throughout the tree's life. In the wild, without humans around pruning some branches off, some potential future branches will still get naturally broken off, and trees will also \"self-prune\", sacrificing their least photosynthetically productive branches (usually the most shaded ones). A whole tree in the shade will generally self-prune more than a whole tree in sunlight, which is part of how a shaded tree ends up growing taller &amp; narrower and a sunlit tree ends up growing shorter &amp; wider. There can also be some adjustment of internode length *versus* thickness in response to light &amp; shading, **in new growth**, but, once an internode has had its growing season that created it, it can never grow again after that, or shrink. It can only stay or get lost/sacrificed.",

            "comment": "No. At least in trees older branches do not elongate, they just grow in diameter (secondary growth, what makes the growth rings). Only vegetative buds or shoots grow in length. That is why the closer to the tree, the thicker are the branches, as they have had more time of secondary growth.\n\nSome species can get longer branches and other can't. Depends on how much weight they can withstand. \n\nCreeping weeds (think ivy or pumpkin), which do not have this constraint as they just lay on the earth can get many many meters long.",

Structures (trees) that survive (don't fall over in the wind) will reproduce, and their 'version of life' creates the next generation basically in their image. For example more leaves make more food but also cause more wind resistance (makes tree fall down,) so simply making more food isn't necessarily the only criteria for tree survival.",

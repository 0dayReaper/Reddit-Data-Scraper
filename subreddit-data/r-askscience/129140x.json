            "comment": "Pet neutering has a huge effect on hormones. That is why almost all pet cats are neutered, both male and female. The hormonal behaviour of cats often includes a lot of loud yelling and marking the area with pee. (Depends on the individual, too.) Most people do not find these to be desirable features in a pet.\n\nNeutering also makes them a lot more playful and sociable towards other cats. You could say they are more kitten-like.\n\nIt does often also make them much more likely to overeat. Unneutered cats are often kind of picky and slim, while with a neutered cat you often have to limit the amount of food they get.",

My other neutered boy is a CHONK though! It's hitting spring so he's starting to lose weight going outside in the yard and playing, he's mostly a lazy butt though, lol!! He's a Maine coon too so he should be around 22 lbs his vet said, but he's closer to 26. We're trying to get him to lose weight, but it's hard!! We did just get a puppy though, they have a good time playing so I'm hoping that'll help. He likes to play with the flying poles that you put feathers on, but even with those he plays hard for like 5 minutes and then just lays there and bats at it.",

To control which animals are allowed to breed - but also, to render those who aren't breeding stock more docile.\n\nBulls are more difficult and dangerous to handle. They are aggressive, require caution and don't respond to force well.  If a bull attacks and gets you down, you likely will never get up again.\n\nSteers are entirely different creatures.  They are easygoing, predictable, just want to eat and be with the herd.\n\nSo that hormonal change is very desirable from our perspective.",

IIRC from reading meta analysis, females gained longevity when they are spayed. Males lifespan's were even more dramatically increased but the cause was accidental deaths dropping dramatically (less roaming). I think the males' lifespans benefited from later altering and the females from earlier, though incontinence was increased slightly in females as you mentioned, and arthritis in large dogs. More obesity and less muscle mass is absolutely going to happen, but the owner is the first reason for obesity and an active lifestyle will go far in preventing arthritis.",

She's finally almost done with the first heat, with an appointment in 2 weeks for her spay. Fingers crossed I made the right choice and we'll have a happy and healthy monster for years to come!",

And even when it's just a single bull with a herd, they tend to want to boss the cows a lot and that results in everyone spending less time eating and gaining.\n\nBulls pastured together with no cows around are a lot more low key and get along pretty well.\n\nFor individual steers, they do become less muscular than they would have as bulls.  But they tend to produce better marbling in the meat (higher body fat), and have higher feed efficiency.  How much of that is behavioral vs hormonal I couldn't say, but it works out for the better in any case.",

We know that removing testicles, and the testosterone they produce, decreases muscle mass and tone. We know it prevents testicular cancer (duh!) and increases rates of prostrate cancer. We have a few small studies in some large breed dogs that suggest removing the gonads of males and females increases the rates of some orthopedic problems, such as ACL rupture, and the rates of certain cancers, such as lymphoma in Golden Retrievers and osteosarcoma in Rottweilers. We know that spaying a female dog before her second heat, and especially before her first heat, dramatically reduces her chances of getting breast cancer. We know that spayed females cannot get pyometra, a fatal infection of the uterus. We know that cats who grow to maturity with their gonads have much thicker skin than those who are neutered. We also know that removing the gonads dramatically reduces the rates of unwanted pregnancies and behaviors associated with reproduction: wandering, fighting, and vaginal discharge (if you can call that a behavior...)\n\nThere is a new movement to perform vasectomies in males, instead of castration, and ovary-sparing spays in females, where we remove the uterus but not the ovaries. A study\\* published very recently in the Journal of the American Veterinarian Medicine showed that, in dogs,  \"Longer exposure to gonadal hormones, regardless of reproductive status, was associated with reduced odds of general health problems and both problematic and nuisance behaviors.\" So perhaps this small trend will soon become the norm. Stay tuned. There's still a lot to learn. \n\n\\*Vasectomy and ovary-sparing spay in dogs: comparison of health and behavior outcomes with gonadectomized and sexually intact dogs  \nChris Zink  \n DVM, PhD, DACVSMRcz@caninesports.com, Mikel M.

Compare that to the 90s when they would tell you 6 weeks lol.",

As far as I know, neutering them doesn't change their life as for humans.\n\nWell it affects the level of hormones and it brings a personality change. \n\nBut in Dogs that is kind of the point for neutering. \n\nRemoving the testicles means less testosterone among other things. The Dog becomes calmer, won't try to run away when smelling a female dog in heat, won't try to jump onto random things. That dog becomes overall more docile. \n\nA male human, who gets his testies removed because of cancer or some other reason would probably not want to become \"more docile\".",

In regards to mammals, human or animal -\n1- one ball removed - usually no biggie hormonally, psychologically for humans sometimes\n2- both balls removed before or after puberty - big difference in either not reaching puberty or losing the benefits of testosterone more or less completely - ie loss of muscle mass, bone density, anddrive for sex\n3- sterilization - that is cutting the tube from balls to penis - does not change anything hormonally, behaviourally, but precludes sperm cells from leaving the body, rendering the male infertile. You still have your balls, behaviour, muscles but can not procreate.",

There are different ways to spay/neuter too, where not everything is removed in order to prevent reproduction. In humans, women can get their tubes tied instead of a whole hysterectomy, so for pets there are techniques to accomplish the goal while sparing the pet other health problems: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGuRGsjw9wM",

If you used a black light in our house, you could see a like and what looked like a sheet of something right at his leg height. He marked every wall going all the way down peeing. I used to joke that he was house trained to pee when we were not looking. He drank so much water he was really hyperactive his pee was diluted enough that the smell wasn't strong enough to notice when got home. I remember as a kid growing up in the 70's every friend's house who had lot of little dog's house always smelled like pee. I still cried when we had to put him down after 17 years, he was a wonderful dog, but he just could not stop marking.",

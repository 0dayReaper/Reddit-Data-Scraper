            "comment": "Threshold of detecting more smells is analogous to the threshold of hearing different frequencies. In both the cases, your sense has a higher sensitivity to perceive and separate different constituents of what's being observed. A good sense of smell is being able to smell a pizza and telling the type of cheese and oregano apart. Since everything you're able to smell is made up of molecules, your ability to detect them depends on how effectively your nose can pick up molecules present in low quantities.",

Do you have a source that everything you're talking about is related, and what that relation is?",

            "comment": "Olfactory bulb area of the brain is a very sensitive and one of the most primitive areas of the brain. It is linked to emotional awareness, long term memory formation and making the connection between these two. It's also very susceptible to psychedelic use or anything that works as an agonist on the 5ht-2a receptor. These receptors when sensitive will help contribute to enjoying a more vibrant and familiar sense of environment. Without them I assume all other brain regions are left with reduced stimulation from this region and this could help contribute to depression or any other issue related to reduced neurogenesis.",

This was due to the closure of the Isthmus of Panama which altered ocean currents and allowed the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation to form (it may have existed in a weakened state before however). This cooled the northern hemisphere allowing ice sheets to form. The ice sheets of Antarctica had already formed at this point however around 34 Ma. \n\nIn short the CO2 levels were higher due to a number of reasons but one was the planet was still in a warm \"phase\" with high levels of atmospheric CO2 because there was less area of ice sheet to store CO2 and cool the planet allowing more CO2 to be stored in the oceans\n\nDisclaimer: this is all I can remember off the top of my head, please correct me if any of it is wrong :-)\n\nEdit: My flight is delayed!

                    "comment": "whoa! \n\nso basically the whole ice ageWas caused by the closing of the Panamanian isthmus?\n\nhttp://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/feature/how-the-isthmus-of-panama-put-ice-in-the-arctic.\n\n&gt;The principal engine of this global circulation, often called the Ocean Conveyor, is the difference in salt content between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Before the Isthmus of Panama existed, Pacific surface waters flowed into the Atlantic. Their waters mixed, roughly balancing the two oceans\u2019 salinity.\n\n&gt;About 5 million years ago, the North American, South American, and Caribbean Plates began to converge. The gradual shoaling of the Central American Seaway began to restrict the exchange of water between the Pacific and Atlantic, and their salinities diverged.\n\n&gt;Evaporation in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean left ocean waters there saltier and put fresh water vapor into the atmosphere. The Trade Winds carried the water vapor from east to west across the low-lying Isthmus of Panama and deposited fresh water in the Pacific through rainfall. As a result, the Pacific became relatively fresher, while salinity slowly and steadily increased in the Atlantic.\n\n&gt;As a result of the Seaway closure, the Gulf Stream intensified. It transported more warm, salty water masses to high northern latitudes, where Arctic winds cooled them until they became dense enough to sink to the ocean floor. The Ocean Conveyor was rolling, drawing even more Gulf Stream waters northward.\n\nsnip\n\n&gt;On their journey to the North Pacific, these deep waters became enriched in nutrients and carbon dioxide. In the Subarctic Pacific, these deep waters could have upwelled, rising to the sunlit surface to provide the ingredients to spark enormous blooms of phytoplankton. Great abundances of silica and opal (the preserved material from the phytoplankton shells) in seafloor sediments are evidence of both the blooms and the strong upwelling.\n\n&gt;The upwelling may have been so strong, however, that the phytoplankton did not keep pace with the upwelling\u2014that is, more carbon dioxide upwelled than was used by the phytoplankton. Consequently, the excess carbon dioxide \u201cleaked\u201d back into the atmosphere, adding a greenhouse gas that warmed the planet.\n\n&gt;What shut down the Mid-Pliocene Warm Period about 2.7 million years ago? And what finally caused Northern Hemispheric glaciation at about the same time\u2014but nearly 2 million years after the Isthmus of Panama formed?\n\n&gt;Neal Driscoll and Gerald Haug proposed one solution. They postulated that moisture carried northward by the Gulf Stream was transported by prevailing westerly winds to Eurasia. It fell as rain or snow, eventually depositing more fresh water into the Arctic Ocean\u2014either directly, or via the great Siberian rivers that empty into the Arctic Ocean.\n\n&gt;The added fresh water would have facilitated the formation of sea ice, which would reflect sunlight and heat back into space. It would also act as a barrier blocking heat stored in the ocean from escaping to the atmosphere above the Arctic. Both these phenomena would further cool the high latitudes. In addition, Arctic waters flowing back into the North Atlantic would have become less cold and salty\u2014short-circuiting the efficiency of the Ocean Conveyor belt as a global heat pump to North Atlantic regions.",

Positive feedbacks are very important in climate change and the azolla event, while significant in its own right, would have more importantly probably launched several positive feedbacks that contributed to locking up increasing amounts of carbon close to the poles, slowly decreasing atmospheric CO2 and temperature over tens of millions of years.\n\nSimultaneously, other changes causally unrelated to organic carbon sequestration occurred as well and also contributed to the cooling trend. Especially important here are the changes in ocean currents, including the completion of the West Wind Drift, which isolated Antarctica about 30mya and the closing of the Panama isthmus abut 5mya. These effects contribute to their own important positive feedbacks as well as interacting with previous feedbacks.\n\nSo none of these things solely created the icehouse Earth of today (though it's hard to know what the effect of any single factor in isolation is because of the many interacting feedbacks), but they all contributed to an ongoing process.",

                                                    "comment": "Unless I'm mistaken, there's a number of astronomical factors involved in making a warming or cooling trend more or less likely, including the actual axial tilt of the Earth (the current tilt of around 23.4 oscillates by round +/-2, from 22.1 to 24.5 degrees).  The more axial tilt, the more intense seasons, and thus winters will be.  Obviously we're still closer to 24.5 the maximum than 22.1, the minimum.\n\nThere's also the eccentricity of Earth's orbit, whereby our elliptical orbit at times becomes slightly more elliptical (making colder temps on the far-side of the ellipse), and there's the timing of these events such that winter being when the axial tilt of one the poles is tilted away from the sun, that can coincide with the point in Earth's elliptical orbit where the Earth is furthest from the Sun, and also coincide with the maximum elongation of the elliptical orbit, further intensifying the effect.\n\nFor most of these, we're not really far off from an alignment of factors for an ice age, and no surprise that we are still at the tail end of an ice age.\n\nThe big \"gotcha\" is that as you say, there are many factors that can contribute.  If for example world leaders decided to find out just what happens when they chuck their nuclear arsenals at each other, I'm certain nobody would again question man's ability to affect climate.\n\nFundamentally, none of these astronomical factors can directly influence CO2 levels.  Indirectly by suppressing or encouraging plant growth, sure... But as you said, there's so many factors with oceean currents, plate tectonics, etc... At some point though the Earth is sitting in a prime setting for an ice age and something like a super volcano erupts and what do you know?  An ice age.  Other times the factors just aren't in alignment and a supervolcano just causes a short term drop in temps but no long-lasting ice age.  Likewise a cataclysmic event could obviously initiate major climate change without needing any other factors to be in-play.",

It does seem possible, like I think you're suggesting, that a combination of the orbital cycles could prime the climate system for a shift that might be pushed by another factor. The trajectory could then be sustained by positive feedbacks well after the Milankovich cycles have moved to other phases. It's also possible that there's some longer term astronomic cycles or events that have not been well described. I've heard people talk about cycles in solar output that could be on the order of millions to hundreds of millions of years. Also some stuff about our solar system moving through more and less dense clouds of interstellar dust. I really have no idea how valid those ideas are though.\n\nI do tend to think that continental position and various internal climate feedbacks have the largest effects at these time scales, though. Milankovich acts on top of those factors at a smaller time scale.",

We have an extremely short record of the solar output, plus some historical records of intense flares during the middle ages.\n\nHonestly the courses I took in college seemed to convey that the Milankovich cycles were the primary factor, and contributing factors were rising / falling CO2 or similar greenhouse gasses from other sources (volcanoes, meteors, dinosaur farts).\n\nI hadn't really read much on the continental drift side of the equation until very recently... I'm sure we're getting a lot more understanding of that in recent years as the geological record becomes progressively more and more complete.\n\nThe basic story that most kids get in school is really a heavily dumbed down version... There's key bits like Pangaea being one of possibly several super-continents for example.\n\nI agree that feedbacks are definitely a major driver, historically and currently.  You get a situation where there's a sudden massive release of methane from deep sea deposits through a quake, it warms the temps by one factor, but then that removes snow cover by a similar factor, but that warms temps by another factor, on and on.\n\nMy real concern is that we're gearing up for a feedback loop that will be uncontrollable in the near future.  How much methane is trapped in the permafrost?  How much would bleaching the coral reefs cause a decline in CO2 absorption?  I feel like we're riding a bull into a china store, thinking... we can drive this thing... we can control it.",

So making generalizations is dangeorus.\n\nIn the long-term history of Earth's climate, though, warmer periods are generally more temperate and subtropical up to very high latitudes. It's actually the ice age periods that are commonly drier and associated with extensive deserts (potentially even at equatorial latitudes during the Carboniferous and Permian ice ages).\n\nHowever, it's unclear how tight the coupling between CO2 driven temperature and global circulation driven moisture are. On long-time scales temperature affects global circulation, but on shorter time scales changes in circulation may lag the change in temperature, which sets up the possibility of hot and dry interphase periods in the transition between an icehouse and a greenhouse. This decoupling may actually be what caused the \"tropical deserts\" of the early Permian.\n\nSo it's very important to keep the time scale in mind: what seems like only a few degrees of warming to us over the next few decades (\"just set your air conditioner and don't worry about it\") can lead to major changes in the distributions of habitat and organisms as seemingly small demographic trends play out over periods of hundreds to thousands to tens of thousands of years, but then as the global circulation and Earth's feedbacks catch up the results can be very different again on a scale of hundreds of thousands and millions of years.",

It's actually much more difficult than estimating new global average temperatures.\n\nThere are some resources for this though. NASA has released some [public datasets](https://nex.nasa.gov/nex/projects/1356/) with estimates for climate changes across the globe. For a simple overview [this article](https://www.epa.gov/climate-change-science/future-climate-change) has [this picture](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-07/globalprecipmap-large.png) which projects significantly more rainfall in norther central Africa, but less along the Mediterranean, and less in Brazil. I don't know what the dots and dashes convey, but in [this picture](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-07/usprecipmaps-large.png) of the US the dashes represent high confidence areas.\n\n[This tool](https://toolkit.climate.gov/climate-explorer2/) lets you explore projections of the US in a lot of different ways. Running these local projections of what specifically may happen as our global climate wildly changes is very, very super-computer intensive, which is why so much better and finer grained data is available of the US, and I suspect that you can find similar granular data sets for Europe.",

Perhaps that isn't good for the overall optics of the dangers, but it would be more honest.",

We have 3 such cells in each hemisphere. http://www.oocities.org/rjwarren_stm/2P4/Trade_Winds_fig01.jpg \nWhat happens in these cells, is just simple physics.  Warm air rises, warm air is found at lower latitudes.  Warm air holds a lot of moisture, and so this warm moist air rises.  As it rises it also cools, which reduces the airs capacity for water vapor.  The water condenses and rains.  This dry air then moves towards the higher latitudes, and at about 25-30 degrees falls back down.  This cool dry air creates a high pressure zone over most of the world at the 25-30 degree latitude.  \n\nIf you look at a climate map, nearly every desert on the planet is found at about 30 degrees latitude.  http://www.armystudyguide.com/content/moxiepix/b1_2450.jpg\n\n",

More accurately if you look at a long term map of the climate over the past 10000 years, you can see that after it warmed out of the last glacial (or \"Ice Age\" in _non_-geology/paleoclimatology terms), it actually rose to a peak and then began to _cool_, before there was this sudden, rapid warming up-spike recently. So if anything, nature was going to take us back to another glacial. Then something happened, and it happened very \"coincidentally\" around the time we started mass burning of fossil fuels.\n\nhttps://www.climate.gov/sites/default/files/styles/inline_all/public/marcott2-13_11k-graph-610.gif?itok=HrOTBQaE\n\n",

Oxygen Isotope levels are really cool!\n\nThere are multiple types of oxygen (varying number of neutrons), that exist in nature at a constant rate over time. Oxygen-18 is heavier, and harder to evaporate than Oxygen-16. Because of this, when a bunch of water is tied up as land ice (mostly O16), it changes the ratio of O-16/O-18 found in ocean deposits.\n\nWe can then infer that rocks with higher O-16 to O-18 Ratios were deposited in warmer climates, when there was less O-16 in Land Ice.",

Kind of like if you break it you bought it. \n\nI realize that we are already affecting climate passively by our actions, but are we as a planet confident in the science and united enough to even undertake such an activity? Would some group be willing or permitted do it unilaterally, given the potential for litigation and/or war?",

What you are reading now, are the words of a person who reached a breaking point and decided to seek the wilds.\n\nThis place, reddit, or the internet, however you come across these words, is making us sick. What was once a global force of communication, community, collaboration, and beauty, has become a place of predatory tactics. We are being gaslit by forces we can't comprehend. Algorithms push content on us that tickles the base of our brains and increasingly we are having conversations with artificial intelligences, bots, and nefarious actors.\n\nAt the time that this is being written, Reddit has decided to close off third party apps. That isn't the reason I'm purging my account since I mostly lurked and mostly used the website. My last straw, was that reddit admitted that Language Learning Models were using reddit to learn. Reddit claimed that this content was *theirs*, and they wanted to begin restricting access.\n\nThere were two problems here. One, is that reddit does not create content. The admins and the company of reddit are not creating anything. We are. Humans are. They saw that profits were being made off their backs, and they decided to burn it all down to buy them time to make that money themselves.\n\nSecond, against our will, against our knowledge, companies are taking our creativity, taking our words, taking our emotions and dialogues, and creating soulless algorithms that feed the same things back to us. We are contributing to codes that we do not understand, that are threatening to take away our humanity.\n\nDo not let them. Take back what is yours. Seek the wilds. Tear this house down.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoVJKj8lcNQ\n\nMy comments were edited with this tool: https://github.com/j0be/PowerDeleteSuite/blob/master/README.md",

Anthropogenic CO2 emissions are very significant on and close to the human time scale, so obviously we care about them a lot and they outweigh tectonic factors and long term feedbacks in our minds and collective social consciousness. Whether they are truly as significant is unknown, though, because we don't really know what the effects of anthropogenic CO2 emissions will be on the geologic time scale.\n\nThere's reconstructed records of several different types of decade- and century-scale climate change events over the past hundred thousand years, but these are just blips that get swallowed up by negative feedbacks, which is why we aren't even able to reconstruct them much back beyond the last interglacial. I'm not saying with any certainty that this will be the case with anthropogenic climate change because there just hasn't been a lot of research into it. It's a time scale that's hard for us to work in when looking forward form the present, but it's really all we can work when we're looking back. That sets up a kind of problem when it comes to assessing relative impacts like you're trying to do.",

It doesn't help that one of our cross-references for checking things like CO2 levels tends to come from ice core samples... which of course don't date back before the beginning of the most recent ice age, and many don't even date back beyond the current interglacial.  This means that when we're using sedimentary deposits to measure levels, we're extrapolating out from the correlations we find during the current age; and it is very possible that these actually don't correlate in the same way when other variables have shifted.\n\nHowever, all that said and relative impacts aside, we've definitely got enough data to see how our current interglacial trend has gone off the rails, and have some specific data sets that correlate very tightly to the changes we've been able to measure directly.\n\nYou're right that it really says nothing about previous greenhouse and glacial ages though; all sorts of factors could have been involved.  And that's even beyond the solar theries.",

So 3 million years ago the ice sheet area was smaller. I take it these ice sheets store CO2 (?) and therefore less CO2 was stored in the ice sheets then. Also, the smaller area of ice presumably reflected less sunlight, leading to higher temperatures then. This caused (?) more CO2 to be stored in the ocean. But then it is still not clear to me why the *atmospheric* CO2 was high then, shouldn't it be sitting in the oceans?",

We haven't taken 3 million years to change the climate back to what it once was, we've taken 100-200. [[IPCC](https://www.climateemergencyinstitute.com/uploads/AR5_extinction_speed___arrows.png)]\n\n&gt; A**brupt irreversible regional damage, by 2100, under all but the best-case emissions scenario (RCP2.6)** \n\n&gt; Within this century, magnitudes and rates of climate change associated with medium- to high-emission scenarios (RCP4.5, 6.0,and 8.5) [i.e., all scenarios except the best-case RCP2.6] pose high risk of abrupt and irreversible regional-scale change in the composition, structure, and function of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, including wetlands. (AR5 WG2 SPM)\n\nPractically speaking, at the rate we are going now most herbaceous plants and virtually all trees can be expected to become radically reduced in population and health by 2100. Simply because if you move the plant's suitable climate more that that one plant can migrate, it dies.\n\nThis is only one of the priceless side of climate change, as for one you could theoretically measure in damages($), water level change is very problematic. The simple facts that \"hot climate melts land ice\" and that we appear to be doing little to lessen CO2 emissions should worry you dramatically. If all land ice melts, the global sea level would rise the equivalent of a [21 story building](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/quickfacts.html) at every shoreline in every country. This is enough to displace roughly[ 40 to 60% of all humans on earth](http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/natlinfo/indicators/methodology_sheets/oceans_seas_coasts/pop_coastal_areas.pdf). Look at the panic that's occurring because of Syrian refugees in the western countries, that was only for [5 million refuges](http://data.unhcr.org/syrianrefugees/regional.php). Admittedly water level rise occurs over a few millennia, but we are getting close to permanently displacing 4.5 billion people. What won't wait for a few millennia, however, are storm surges (e.g. raising the water level a few feet allows for storm surges to be launched further into the mainland, destroying things like [the NYC metro](http://assets.climatecentral.org/images/made/1_24_13_news_andrew_nycsurgeevents_1050_1005_s_c1_c_c.jpg)\n with increasing occurrence).\n\nThis isn't something you can just shut off in 50 years. CO2 emissions are basically inert in the atmosphere, meaning they don't react with much and thus stay in the atmosphere for [many times more than a few millennia.](https://www.skepticalscience.com/co2-residence-time.htm) If we want to counter some of these effects, we have to do it *now*.",

                    "comment": "Geologist here, having extensively researched Carbon Dioxide trends in the Eocene-Oligocene as part of a review paper I wrote. \n\nAs others have pointed out, ice cores don't really last that long. There's the Greenland cores, which date back to 125-130 thousand years, and there's the Antarctic cores, which date back to 400-800 thousand years.\n\nTo investigate carbon dioxide beyond that time frame, we make educated guesses on proxies. For instance, we can do stomata counts on fossilised leaves from that time period. When the atmosphere is more concentrated in carbon dioxide, leaves will have less stomata. A team of researchers in 2010 discovered that stomata growth in new leaves is directed by an enzyme that can \"detect\" atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, and if these levels are lower, more stomata will appear on the new leaves in order to maximise carbon intake, hence explaining the inverse relationship. We count stomata densities from fossilised leaves (see Steinthorsdottir et al., 2016 for an excellent and recent paper). This isn't that easy, however, since counting stomata leaves involves studying modern, hopefully related (I'd say 9 in 10 studies this is not possible, so we go for a \"Nearest Living Equivalent\") species that behave in a similar way. \n\nThere are other proxies, mostly involving isotope fractionation. For instance, studies on boron isotopes allow us to learn about pH of the ocean in the past, and from that we can infer past carbon dioxide levels. Studies on carbon isotopes allow us to reconstruct past sea surface temperatures, and from that we can also infer past carbon dioxide levels. Many chemical proxies are multi-step, involving many assumptions, but that's not to say they are wrong or useless - often, they are the only methods we have in the geological record. \n\nTo answer your other question about how long the atmosphere was \"at that level\" to appear in the ice core:\n\nUnfortunately, the atmosphere doesn't \"stay still\", it is inherently dynamic. Carbon dioxide values fluctuate between summer and winter because of greater rates of photosynthesis in summer than winter, so unfortunately I'd like to kindly point out that your question is not very well phrased. \n\nIce cores allow us to investigate carbon dioxide through trapped bubbles of gas within the highly compact snow. Think about snow falling in Greenland, and this snow will be compacted as new layers of snow fall onto it. Gases will circulate in indiscriminate little pore spaces within this snow, and eventually, after some time, these pore spaces will be sealed due to the snow becoming compacted through burial by newer snow. So, the age of that sealing is far younger than the age of the surrounding ice, which is problematic for us to assign an age to it. (We know however, that it will be younger than the surrounding ice, and we can date the surrounding ice through alternating dark/light layers in the ice, as someone else has pointed out in this thread). The gas that is trapped, we'd like to assume (but not always the case, of course), is representative of the atmosphere exactly at the time that it was sealed - it's not going to be a weekly or monthly or yearly average.

                    "comment": "Sidenote: modelling CO2 isn't easy, and it becomes harder the further you go back in time. General trends are quite reliable and become more reliable the closer you get to the present. However, exact numbers must be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nI tried to find a figure that shows the CO2 distribution in ppm, but the closest I got was [this figure](http://earthguide.ucsd.edu/virtualmuseum/images/raw/CCC_Fig4_2_1.jpg) By Berner (1997). It shows the ratio of CO2 compared to pre-industrial (300 ppm) levels. As you can see, the only time CO2 levels got close to the present levels is in the Upper Carboniferous and the start of the Permian (roughly 350-250 Ma ago). It is often thought that during the late Carboniferous, ice-age like conditions were prevalent. This cooling is related to the increase in erosion because of new mountain chains that were formed during the assembly of Pangaea, and possibly due to inefficient biological breakdown of the large swamp forests that were dominant in the early Carboniferous. Ironically, these formed many of the coal seams that powered the industrial revolution and thus the global warming trend we see now.\n\nBesides this dip, we see that the general trend of CO2 in the geological past is a downwards one, probably related to more efficient weathering. Plants in particular seemed to have a significant impact on weathering rates and CO2 storage.\n\nImportant to note here is that the relation between CO2 and temperature becomes more difficult the further you go back in time. This is because there are other factors influencing temperature on long timescales, such as the solar output, which gradually increases during a star's life. The decrease in atmospheric CO2 counteracts the increased solar output and vice versa, therefore temperatures were not as high in the past as the CO2 curve might suggest. A good figure that shows 'temperature' evolution is [this one](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Phanerozoic_Climate_Change.png) by Veizer et al., (1999, updated 2004). Temperature here is expressed as changes in \u03b418O (isotopic changes in oxygen). These come with their own set of limitations of course, and suffer from the same uncertainties the further beack in time you go. This figure shows that, temperature wise, the closest equivalents would have been the Carboniferous-Permian and Ordovician-Silurian periods. Both periods are so far back in time however, that a comparison between past ecosystems and present ones is of limited use.\n\nBottom line is that comparable situations are scarce and far back in time. Which does nothing to diminish the current situation, mind you. It's not because temperatures as cold as those of the recent past aren't the norm in geological history that the current warming isn't very dangerous. Many of the problems relating global warming have more to do with the speed of global warming than with the actual temperature shift.\n\nSource for the figures:\n\nBerner, R.A., 1997, The Rise of Plants and Their Effect on Weathering and Atmospheric CO2, Science 276, p. 544-547\n\nVeizer, J. et al., 1999, 87Sr/86Sr, d13C and d18O evolution of Phanerozoic seawater.

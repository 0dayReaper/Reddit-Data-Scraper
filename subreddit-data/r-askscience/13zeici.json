            "comment": "Probably because it is C02 in a high pressure cylinder is a liquid not a compressed gas like nitrogen or argon.  When you are using a tank to fill another tank there is a tube in the supply tank that goes all of the way to the bottom and you are transferring liquid from one tank to the other.  When I was a helper as a teenager doing this kind of work they used a compressor between the two tanks.  I am pretty sure that this means it would end up at a lower pressure (the vapor pressure of CO2) in the receiving tank than in the hose that was supplying the liquid and thus Joule-Thompson cooling comes into play.  \n\nWhen you are using CO2 gas for something like beer there is no tube and it just used the gas above the liquid.",

You know when 2 tanks equalize you're left with 2 tanks with the same pressure and no transfer will occur further, the booster pump is there to transfer the remaining quantity of the supply tank which will only become lower in pressure.",

                            "comment": "There are two concepts to look at. (PV)/T and phase change. The first works when the state of the gas does not change. T is from absolute zero, so increasing the pressure and decreasing the volume will increase the temperature (relative to absolute zero). This works with any ideal gas. SCUBA gas/balloon tanks are under high pressure but at standard  temp. Venting any gas tank will be cold because of the change of pressure and volume. Solid CO2(dry ice) or liquid CO2 can exist  at standard pressure because they are so cold. Their gas is cold because they are cold and and phase change.  The symbolic path escapes me due to the late hour, win and bad memories related to heat transfer and fluid flow classes.",

            "comment": "If you just compress a gas, even to liquid state, heat is generated but in this case that has dissipated. When you reduce pressure or evaporate it gets colder.\n\nLike below, what you're thinking of is refilling ie tank to tank. There's no significant compression happening. There's one larger tank already filled &amp; at room temp, you connect another empty tank, the larger tank sees a drop in pressure, cools &amp; evaporates some, + the gas/liquid going through the pipe to the other tank &amp; also has some expansion/evaporation &amp; cools as it gets to the other tank.\n\nWith liquified gas xfer eg propane or liquid nitrogen, the second tank is usually opened a little to help the liquid through &amp; keep the pressures from just equalizing.  This increases the cooling effects.",

                    "comment": "Yeah, all of the compression is usually done at the air tank refilling company.  A huge compressor takes in and compresses filtered air, then an exchanger condenses out CO2, then one condenses out N2, then one condenses the remaining O2.  The pressure and temperature at each condensation step is controlled to optimize purity and energy cost, and further purification is done when needed.  All of the heat ends up going into an evaporated water cooling tower.\n\nSmall scale CO2 production is impractical, so end users usually take from a bigger, higher pressure tank.  \n\nCO2 is also sometimes captured at power plants, where the discharge has higher concentrations of CO2. This isn't easy though, because exhaust has lots of heat and some undesirables to deal with.",

            "comment": "The same principle that make air conditioning work. When you release a liquid under pressure it changes state into a gas and gets cold.  AC units spray pressurized refrigerant  through an orifice to drop temp. James Dewar discovered most of this and used one liquid state change to gas to get cold enough to make another gas cold enough to liquefy. IIRC he used liquid CO2 to get to liquid N2 to get to liquid O2 to get to liquid H2.",

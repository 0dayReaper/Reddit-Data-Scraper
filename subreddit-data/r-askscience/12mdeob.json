Considering that ants still breathe, just through their exoskeleton, are there any particular ways they dig tunnels to improve air flow, or do they just need so little air that it circulates naturally?",

You could put a colony in a sealed jar and it would take months, if not years for them to exhaust the oxygen (assuming they had enough food and water).  Some species intentionally plug the entrances to their nest when faced with flooding, letting the colony survive on just the oxygen in the tunnels, then switching to anaerobic respiration, requiring no oxygen, to hold out for a bit longer.\n\nThat being said, RE: circulation, it's basically just natural circulation.  Since they're \"cold blooded\", they don't really generate much heat (and can easily just stop metabolizing if they need), but the small amount that they (and their larvae) do generate is probably more than enough to get micro-convention currents going, pulling fresh ever so slightly colder air down into tunnels, just enough for their oxygen needs.",

It's surprising how little it takes even when exerting heavily swimming steadily against current Etc.\n\nThe scrubber canister took care of the CO2, although the absorbent steadily loses its ability to absorb CO2, and you can't get it wet or you get a mouth full of caustic cocktail as we called it.\n\nWhen you first start breathing off the rig you do a purge cycle and manually add oxygen to the breathing Loop while exhaling through your nose to work all the nitrogen out of the system.\n\nAfter that you just breathe the same oxygen in the system again and again until you feel that there's less gas volume and you can't take full breaths as the oxygen is consumed. At that point you manually push a button on the high pressure bottle and add oxygen to the loop so you can breathe comfortably again.  Just a quick half second burst of oxygen. \n\nYou only need to do that every couple of minutes at the most.\n\nI was surprised when I trained to the units how little oxygen we really consumed. They're an interesting system to operate, although they have some extra dangerous using 100% oxygen.\n\nThe dive tables that govern the safe dive parameters only allowed for 20 ft depth or one Excursion  to 25 ft for less than 5 minutes.  Any more time than that at high oxygen partial pressures starts running risk of central nervous system problems with oxygen toxicity.  Like sudden convulsions without warning.",

But in any case they made the same hiss when you added oxygen to the breathing Loop so you could tell when it happened.\n\nThere are things you do in more advanced diving that just inherently require high levels of operator competence though.  Technical divers will carry breathing mixtures that are suitable for various depth ranges on their descent, but if breathed at the wrong one would be fatal.\n\nI did two types of diving, regular scuba with compressed air and the closed loop oxygen rebreathers.  The rebreathers were more complex to operate and were essentially a shallow water only device. Their main danger was CNS 02 toxicity from too great a depth. The one advantage they had was that at that shallow depth and because you purge the nitrogen from your system, there were no decompression tables to follow or concerns about a primary danger in Diving- decompression illness.\n\nTo answer your question about how long and how many Dives we could do, that was all planned per the Navy dive manual and tables, which is extremely comprehensive.  Although I was well trained for my job, our Dives were planned and supervised by a Dive supervisor, with a senior enlisted Dive Master backing them, and a certified dive medicine doctor supporting him if anything went wrong.  Our unit also had a small air portable hyperbaric chamber that they both could use in the event of a dive injury.\n\nWhat was fascinating to me is how all of the information contained in the Navy's dive tables was arrived at.  There is an entire experimental dive unit that works on that.  They put volunteer divers on various breathing mixtures at simulated depths in a hyperbaric chamber while they ride exercise bicycles and they are observed by doctors.\n\nA fascinating human effort indeed!",

I've worked at a mine for some time and there we had a closed-cycle emergency rebreather devices issued to everyone, for situations like underground fire. It was exactly the size of the jar. When starting such a device you first inhale deeply then exhale inside the device and strap it on, and it's then going only on that exhaled air by scrubbing the CO2 from it and breaking it down to C and O2, without mixing in the outside air. So, using only the amount of air you have exhaled once into the device, it was able to keep you breathing for two hours if you haven't actively moved, or around 3/4 of an hour if you have walked. And it expired in the end not because oxygen ended but because chemicals which scrubbed the CO2 were ending. So if you had a spare one, then you could have inhaled deeply again and switch to the second one and had it running too for the same amount of time.",

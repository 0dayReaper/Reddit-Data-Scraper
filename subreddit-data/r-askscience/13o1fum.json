            "comment": "There are a few reasons. One is money. More money has gone into HHV-3 research. Mainly because it has a higher disease burden than HHV-1 and 2.\n\nBut HHV-1 and 2 also present several issues making them difficult to generate vaccines for. Their ability evade the immune system makes them hard to target and genetic variability make it hard to come up with a one-size-fits-all vaccine.\n\nThere's also the issue of challenge. Most vaccine development requires a challenge stage where the subject is exposed to the virus. Since these are lifelong infections, that's not ethical in this case.\n\nThere have been some stabs at coming up with a vaccine but none have worked out so far.",

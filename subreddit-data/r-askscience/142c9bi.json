    "postText": "Hi Reddit! We're Ruby Leung, Mark Wigmosta, and Andre Coleman from the U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). We're here today to discuss [our scientific approach to tackling wildfires](https://www.pnnl.gov/news-media/taming-tomorrows-wildfires), an issue that has become increasingly prominent, particularly in the Western United States.\n\nAs the wildfire seasons seem to extend and intensify each year, our team and fellow researchers are diligently working on predicting, preventing, and mitigating these disasters. From predicting the occurrence and direction of big blazes to implementing strategies to prevent future fires, our team is leveraging a broad spectrum of scientific perspectives to combat wildfires.\n\nOne of our tools, [the RADR-Fire satellite system](https://www.pnnl.gov/projects/rapid-analytics-disaster-response), led by Andre Coleman, helps firefighting personnel, utilities operators, and other decision makers better understand a fire's behavior so they can make informed choices in the midst of natural disaster. It also aids utility operators assess risk by identifying areas prone to wildfire and which energy infrastructure needs protection.\n\nOn the preventative side, Mark Wigmosta and team have developed a new tool with the U.S. Forest Service to determine where controlled burns or thinning would be most effective in reducing fire hazards. Such measures have been found to potentially reduce fire hazards by 25-96 percent in certain cases, and also yield benefits like reduced smoke and increased streamflow.\n\nMeanwhile, Ruby Leung is leading a team in creating models that consider an expanded list of \"wildfire predictors,\" delivering a more complete picture of how likely it is that a fire strikes, how far it burns, and how much smoke it releases into the atmosphere.\n\nOur collective work is helping us get an edge on tomorrow's wildfires, making utilities more resilient to natural disasters, and increasing our understanding of fire behavior in response to climate change. We're here today to discuss our research, the scientific principles behind it, and how we see it impacting the future of wildfire management.\n\nWe'll be on at **8am pacific (11 AM ET, 15 UT)**, ask us anything!\n\nUsername: /u/PNNL",

Obviously climate change is doing no favors with hotter and dryer seasons, but in human intervention in the fires causing more issues in the long run?",

Part of restoration planning is to return these naturally fire-dominated landscapes to their more natural state of more frequent, but less intense wildfire through a combination of mechanical thinning and prescribed fire.  Current fuel moisture content and weather play an important role in burning operations. We would tailor a unique approach for the wildland-urban interface, where you have more people and structures, of course. -Mark",

                    "comment": "Fundamentally, wildfire behavior will be driven and bound by the same physics anywhere in the world. One of my favorite visuals on this is found in a paper by Moritz et al. (2005) (Wildfires, complexity, and highly optimized tolerance, https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0508985102#fig1) where three wildfire triangles are presented that indicate the dominant controls across scales of time and space. At the finest scale, it\u2019s about the fuels (vegetation), the heat, and the oxygen availability. Most often for modeling work, we look at the \u2018days\u2019 scale, where the fuels, weather, and topography play the most significant role. What will change from place to place, season to season, and day to day are the vegetation characteristics (e.g., vegetation structure, the mixture of grasses, shrubs/small trees, and mature trees \\[fine/medium/heavy fuels\\], the mixture of live and dead vegetation, vegetation density, the vegetation moisture/stress), and the meteorology (e.g., relative humidity, air temperature, wind speed and direction \\[important with respect to topography\\], and precipitation).\n\n  \nWith respect to RADR, this system uses many different types of earth observation satellite sensors, many of which can collect shortwave, midwave, and longwave infrared signals (https://science.nasa.gov/ems/07\\_infraredwaves) that enable us to \u201csee\u201d through smoke plumes. From these signals we can map the intensely burning areas (including the fire front), spot fires, areas that are smoldering, the full burn impact area, and even assess the temperature of the wildfire. Clouds present a different issue though - surface-emitted infrared signals are obscured by clouds, thus requires active sensing, such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR; https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/backgrounders/what-is-sar) to help assess ground conditions. In this case, we can really only detect what is changing on the ground with respect to changing vegetation structure (e.g., which tells us where the fire is going), but there is no detection of intense heat, scattered heat, spot fires, etc. like with infrared sensors.\" -Andre",

                    "comment": "Excellent question, and the answer is yes. With the RADR system we work to minimize the satellite coverage issue by using a wide number of available satellites (dominantly government sponsored-systems, but some commercial systems too). Each satellite and satellite constellation (where you have multiple individual satellites that carry the same sensor types) has its own orbit trajectory and revisit rates. So, by using multiple satellites, and even sensors aboard the international space station (ISS) we can often get 3-4 collections over an area in a given day.\n\nThere are several startup companies now that are working to build and launch a constellation of smallsats with sensors configured to wildfire detection (short/medium/longwave infrared detections) at 15-minute intervals with each pixel representing 50-70 m on the ground, which is an ideal spatial resolution for wildfire. There are geostationary weather satellites (e.g., GOES) that can provide 5-10 minute updates, but for comparison, each pixel on GOES represents 2 kilometers on the ground, so this type of sensor has a different level of utility.\n\nThe use of uncrewed aerial systems (UAS; drones) are also a valuable tool in monitoring and tactically managing wildfires. UAS are regularly used in wildfire events, but these are often small UAS (sUAS) that have limited flight times (20-40 minutes). Often these UAS are enough for incident command teams to get a look over the next ridge or get improved situational awareness for a ground crew where visibility is limited.  For automated systems like RADR, it is important for data to be collected in a way where data can be posted to a central server where imagery can be retrieved and processed in an automated way. This is why established satellite systems are valuable.  Medium and large UAS are valuable, too, but used less frequently due to expertise and cost, but the longer flight durations are incredibly valuable.\n\nIn the future, we\u2019re looking toward high-altitude satellite systems (HAPS; e.g., [https://www.airbus.com/en/products-services/defence/uas/uas-solutions/zephyr](https://www.airbus.com/en/products-services/defence/uas/uas-solutions/zephyr)) which look like large UAS deployed to the stratosphere and can persist for months at a time).",

And those disturbances are influenced by climate change. For example, in the Pacific Northwest, changes in disturbance regimes can affect forest structure by shifting dry forests to shrublands or grasslands and thus change the fire regimes (ref: Halofsky et al., 2020; https://fireecology.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s42408-019-0062-8). Some other studies also showed that more frequent fire will likely lead to greater landscape homogeneity (Harvey et al. 2016), which will also alter future fire regimes (ref: Harvey et al. 2016; https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10980-016-0408-4).",

Medium and large UAVs with longer-flight durations and the right kinds of observation sensors are certainly a key asset here, and the idea of persistent sensing over wildfires is valuable, especially for highly-dynamic events. Some considerations with longer-duration UAVs are regarding flight altitudes (i.e., how much of the fire can be observed and at what frequency?), aviation conflicts (i.e., is the UAV operation causing safety issues for other aviation activities?), data processing (i.e., is there an automated approach to processing the UAV-collected imagery to get to actionable data for incident command teams? This may also look like edge-computing onboard the UAV to minimize the amount of data that has to be transferred over data communications), and finally, cost (i.e., what is the cost to purchase, maintain, and operate a large UAV vs. using, in many cases, freely available satellite imagery). There are tradeoffs in spatial resolution, temporal resolution, and spectral fidelity, which is why I would advocate for a multi-sensing approach. -Andre",

For Australia specifically, people have observed exponential increases in burn area during the fall and winter seasons, revealing changes in fire seasonality due to shifting climate (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27225-4#:\\~:text=Forests%20in%20Australia%20experienced%20an,of%20800%25%20when%20including%202019). So the short answer is that, yes, it\u2019s getting more difficult to predict wildfire risk with changing climate conditions. The longer answer to this is below\u2026  \n\n\nThe wildfire risk models we use differ in their forecast periods \u2013 this may range from week-ahead where we are more focused on current meteorology and short-to-medium range forecasted meteorology to year and decade-ahead risk models. The week-ahead models aren\u2019t as impacted by longer-term climate change as we can roll in current conditions from weather and vegetation condition. Many of the models we use for annual and decade-ahead will also use historical observations that include where a fire started, what day of the year it started, how long the fire burned, and how much area burned. \n\nThese historical records are formulated into statistical probabilities that help with future risk predictions. As we see these pivot points in the long-term historical record (i.e., the past 30 years isn\u2019t on the same trendline as the past 10 years), we are shifting to use less of the longer-term historical record (30 years) and we focus the more recent record (10-15 years). We also recognize that these pivot points will vary from place to place, so we segment analysis areas out into pyromes \u2013 which is kind of a watershed or ecoregion for fire. It\u2019s important to note that some pyromes do not have a clear pivot point and the longer-term trends don\u2019t have a strong positive trend.  \n\nFor longer-forecast wildfire risk assessment, we also leverage downscaled and bias-corrected global circulation models (GCMs) with different emission scenarios to help in the decade to multi-decade risk forecasting, but of course, across different GCM models and different emission scenarios, there is still a lot of uncertainty in our predictions. -Andre",

He explained to me one day that the reason California wildfires are so bad is because of how quickly fire departments have put them out over the past 100 years. He went on to say native Americans used to purposely set fires to clear out under brush so the could ride horseback through the forests there. By burning yearly the under brush would not build up enough to sustain itself long enough to burn down trees. By constantly putting out all fires we caused massive amounts of under brush to build where now entire forests and the trees burn.

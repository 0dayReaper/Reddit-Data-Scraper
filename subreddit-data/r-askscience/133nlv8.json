The main problem here would be finding that tiny thing somewhere between the tubes and the uterus and then retrieving it without damaging too much. The rest would be very similar to IVF but with an added risk of infection.\n\nAfter nidation I can't see at all how this would work.",

(Uterine transplants have been done, but not with a fetus inside.)\n\nLet me emphasize again that I have no expertise.",

That seems odd given that a ball as big as the Sun made of iron would be far more dense and have way more gravity strength even if you don\u00b4t know about Einsteinian relativity. So when did people first have a decent idea of the mass of the Sun?",

            "comment": "The mass of the Sun was first estimated by Newton in his Principia Mathematica (1687). What he actually computed was the ratio of the Sun to Earth mass as this does not require any estimate of the gravitational constant. This was later improved in Principia (1713/1726) to correct errors he introduced the first time. His estimate by this point was within only a factor of two of the modern value while his original prediction was a factor of 10 out. This was all simply done using Newton's newly formed universal law of gravitation and is regarded as the first accurate estimates for the mass of the Sun. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nLets get into composition a bit because the dates may surprise people a bit with quite how modern Solar astrophysics is (despite the fact it can be dated back to [800 BC](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-0-387-92790-9) with the first observations of sunspots)! The big leap in knowlage started in 1802 with the start of [spectroscopy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectroscopy), the observation by [William Hyde Wollaston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hyde_Wollaston) of black lines in the spectrum of light emitted by the Sun, however, William did not seem overly interested in this and indeed did not pursue it more. 16 years later the black lines were rediscovered by [Joseph von Fraunhofer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_von_Fraunhofer) and it was now recognised that spectroscopy could inform us on properties it the solar atmosphere. It took quite some time before this really took off and a number of people were involved but perhaps the next big leap was in the 1850s by [Robert Wilhelm Bunsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bunsen) (of the Bunsen burner) and [Gustav Kirchhoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Kirchhoff) who were able to determine a large number of chemical elements that make up the Sun. However, at the time they did not know the abundances of any of these elements and the elements discovered were the same that make up the Earth. Interestingly, helium was not one of the elements observed, in fact, at the time helium was not even a known element. It was actually discovered by spectroscopy of the [Sun in 1868](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium#Scientific_discoveries). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this point, and until 1929, the Sun and all other stars were assumed to have the same chemical composition as the Earth. So it is less odd than you might think because it was based on simply what elements were present in the Sun and noticing that this is the same as Earth. However, by 1870 it was clear the Sun was not just a massive Earth like object as [Jonathan H. Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Homer_Lane) began working on the internal structure of the Sun by making the assumption that the Sun was in gaseous form and in [hydrostatic equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium). Work on the internal structure continued (and still continues to this day) by the likes of [Robert Emden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Emden) and [Arthur Stanley Eddington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington) and lay the foundations for what we understand of stellar structure in Eddington's 1926 book [The Internal Constitution of the Stars](https://www.nature.com/articles/106014a0). It was not until 1929 in the [PhD thesis](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1925PhDT.........1P) of [Cecilia H. Payne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecilia_Payne-Gaposchkin) determined that the most abundant chemical in the Sun was hydrogen followed by helium and both of these were far more abundant than anything else. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSome interesting books: [A concise history of solar and stellar physics](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt9qh01p), [Early Solar Physics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780080066530/early-solar-physics), [The Sun Recorded Through History: Scientific Data Extracted from Historical Documents](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-0-387-92790-9).",

                    "comment": "If I may add some more early history, since your post got me looking this up again: the earliest calculation of the Earth-Sun distance (among others) that was sound and influential to future authors was [by Aristarchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Sizes_and_Distances_(Aristarchus)) (~310--230 BCE), and many more astronomical calculations came in over the centuries refining and expanding upon results like these. But it seems to have taken on a new level of accuracy and precision with Ptolemy (~100--170 CE), who figured an Earth-Sun distance of 1210 Earth radii (actual: ~23500), which is pretty good for the time -- excepting the consideration that Ptolemy made some mistakes in his re-measurement of the radius of the Earth that resulted in a significant underestimate compared to previous authors. \\[Translation with commentary, plus table and discussion of calculations by [Hamm](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/32069/1/Hamm_Elizabeth_A_201111_PhD_Thesis.pdf); distances at pp 193--196.\\] In general however, the calculations were remarkably accurate, which goes a long way to explaining why it was the standard astronomy textbook up through Kepler. \\[See e.g. [Fitzpatrick's slides](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/talks/AlmagestNotes.pdf) challenging the notion that the Ptolemaic system was largely failing by Copernicus's time.\\] \n\nTo your coverage of the history of discovering the composition of the Sun, I'll add tangentially that my personal favorite astronomy mystery of the same era was the problem of what makes the Sun shine. 19th century astronomers (and much earlier) understood that the Sun and stars were the only bodies emitting their own light, with the moons and planets instead reflecting the Sun's light. But with the significant 19th-century advancement of thermodynamics, it became apparent that any reasonable model for the Sun to emit light and heat, isolated as it is, would effectively mean a ridiculously short lifespan of the Sun -- around a few hundred thousand years at most, and that's only by getting really cute with the calculation. Most astronomers and physicists at the time were deeply embarrassed by this, as by the late 19th century the confluence of Darwin's evolutionary theory and advancements in geology and paleontology had largely established a scientific consensus that the Earth and Sun must be hundreds-of-millions-to-billions of years old. (Although I'd suspect some lowball estimates in the couple-million-year range would have been published as well, again by being cute, to try to harmonize with the known physics.) This was considered important because, as documented in correspondence from the time, there was great concern in the scientific community about Biblical Creationism spreading as a counter to Darwinian evolution; hence the \"embarrassment\" of astrophysicists. \\[My source on these characterizations is a small history-of-astrophysics book from the '70s that I read long ago -- I may be able to track it down and will update this when I do.\\] The [discovery of radioactivity and fission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_of_nuclear_fission) at the turn of the century finally gave astrophysicists new internal sources of energy from which they could theorize the Sun gets its power -- but even the most optimistic models of fission couldn't break into the billion-year age range needed for agreement with biology and geology. It wasn't until [Eddington's 1920 proposal of fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_nucleosynthesis#History) and first estimates that sufficient mechanisms to sustain power over such an age were conceivable. \n\nSorry for the long summary of the story (and lack of source for now), but I think it's a neat episode in the history of modern science of how the early scientific community behaved both internally and to the external public, in the context of the early Evolution-vs-Creation dispute, at their complete lack of a compatible theory.",

The author must have also included a discussion of Kelvin's and Helmholtz's works, but &lt;100 kA still feels like it was in there somehow, and it may have been on a more naive estimate, perhaps that naively ignored gravitational potential energy (as I didn't recall that either).",

                            "comment": "Newton initially used solar parallax to determine the distance between the Sun and Earth but made an error (I actually am not sure what the error was) which resulted in a factor 10 error in Principia Mathematica. \nBy 1672 Giovanni Cassini figured out the true Earth-Sun distance using the method of parallax. This lead Newton to correct his mass ratio estimate in Principia (1713/1726).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo how did he compute this mass ratio? First we consider the general situation that the gravitational force equals the orbital centripetal force. This gives us G M m / r^2 = m v^2 /r, where M and m are the masses of the two objects, r is their orbital separation (which we assume a circular orbit), G is the gravitational constant (which importantly its value was unknown when Newton made his estimate), and v is the orbital velocity. We then substitute the orbital velocity for v = 2 pi r / T, where T is the orbital period. Thus we get G M  = (4 pi^2 r^3 ) / (T^2 ), where we have rearranged and canceled the m terms. Let us assume then that this big M is the mass of the Sun and r^2 is the distance between the Earth and Sun and T is the Earths orbital period. We can also consider the Earth-Moon system and write G m = (4 pi^2 a^3  )/ (P^2 ), where a is the distance between the Earth and Moon (something that was known by Newton) and P is the orbital period of the Moon. Now we can simply divide GM by Gm to cancel off the gravitational constant terms and we are left with M/m = (r/a)^3 (P/T)^2 where all the terms on the right hand side were known to Newton. (hopefully I have not made any silly typos in this).",

            "comment": "Knowing the mass and knowing the composition are two completely different tasks.\n\nTo get the mass you use its gravitational influence on the planets, e.g. Earth. You need Newton's law of gravity (1687), the gravitational constant (effectively 1780-1800, although the formulas looked a bit different back then), Earth's distance to the Sun (~1660 for reasonable precision) and the orbital period (prehistoric...). If you assume that Earth has a density that's not completely different from rocks then you can get a rough estimate for the gravitational constant without a lab experiment. That means people could work out a mass of the order of 10^(30) kg in the late 17th century and estimate 2\\*10^30 once Cavendish measured the gravitational constant in the lab. Using the distance to the Sun and its apparent angle in the sky it's easy to calculate its volume, so you get its average density: 1.4 g/cm^(3).\n\nHistorically the distance came first, but it's interesting to note that you don't need the distance to the Sun to find its density. If the distance were e.g. twice as large then the mass and the volume estimate both increase by a factor 2^(3) so the density is the same.\n\n----\n\nWhat does that density tell you about the composition? Almost nothing. 1.4 g/cm^(3) is 40% denser than water and half the density of various rocks, but this is an average density. The surface has a density below 0.001 g/cm^(3), thinner than air, the core has a density of up to 150 g/cm^(3), 7 times the density of gold. Neither place has solid matter where you could just look up the density in a table. Knowing the density as function of radius already needs a model of how the Sun works and where it gets its energy from.",

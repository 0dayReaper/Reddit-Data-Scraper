The red blood cells hold the goodies, so if less plasma=more red then more red=more goodies per that millil",

            "comment": "Your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is incredibly well tied to loss of function, concentration of alcohol in the brain, etc.\n\nOne test method is [gas chromatography](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8027927/).  Someone takes a sample of blood and put it in a special vial.  Heat it up and the alcohol content evaporates out.  You can collect that gas and measure the concentration of alcohol.  It's a short calculation to then calculate mass of alcohol per mass/volume of blood.\n\nAlcohol/ethanol in your body is carried everywhere there is water in your body.  It displaces water (e.g. ethanol kicks water off the team and takes it place).  Most of the water in your blood is the plasma but some will get inside the red blood cells.  \n\nIt doesn't matter if someone has higher or lower RBC.  All the test needs to know is what mass of alcohol per unit volume.\n\nComplicated words: [BAC can be either volume or mass calculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_alcohol_content#Units_of_measurement).  some places use a **BAC by volume**, so 0.05% BAC means that your blood is 0.05% alcohol/ethanol by volume.  Other places use **BAC by mass**, so 0.05% BAC means that 100 grams of your blood contain 0.05 g (50 mg) of alcohol/ethanol.\n\nFor a BAC all you need to know is the concentration in any part of the body and you have a really good 90%+ confidence of what the concentration is anywhere in the body.\n\n[A dehydrated person will show a higher BAC compared to a hydrated person](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091305712000585).  That also means your impairment has increased.\n\nWorth noting, [a dehydrated person with a BAC = hydrated person BAC](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24867575/) will have the same level of impairment.  However, the dehydrated person will have drunk less alcohol to have the same level of impairment.\n\nAnother test we can do to confirm the HS-GC is looking at alcohol metabolites in the blood.  Various enzymes in your body break down the alcohol to form other unique biomarkers.  It's the lab equivalent of looking through your trash for empty containers.",

    "postText": "Seeing as the host cell does not actually die during liberation of many types of viruses, why can they then cause so much damage and even death to hosts such as ourselves? Obviously they steal energy and resources in order to replicate themselves, but except in cases of profound viremia I wouldn't expect this to necessarily cause severe harm to a large host like humans.",

Now imagine a virus that we have no immune response against...it would just keep spreading to other cells. Eventually you would end up with virtually all of a given cell type being infected and actively churning out viruses. This would be a considerable strain on our body's resources and the conditions that we evolved in were often tough and unforgiving. In starvation conditions, who do you think will be more likely to survive: the animal that is expending huge amounts of energy and resources producing viruses that offer no benefit to the organism or the one that initiates an aggressive immune response to nip the infection in the bud before it reaches that point? Sure, the immune response might make you feel bad for a while but hopefully it would keep you alive in the long run.",

A lot of cancers and genetic diseases have been suspected of having a viral origin. Think of these like a ticking time bomb waiting for the right conditions to be met before they cause problems. As someone else mentioned they can also triggee your immune system to go haywire to try to find and remove them. This can also be potential cause for many autoimmune disorders.",

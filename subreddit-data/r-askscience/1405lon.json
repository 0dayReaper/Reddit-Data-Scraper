            "comment": "Your brain is basically segregated from both the outside world and the rest of your body by a multi-layered security system intended to protect it and keep out any potential threats. Membranes called meninges surround the brain and keep it floating in your skull as well as providing a physical barrier to microorganisms. The blood vessels that feed the brain are lined with special cells that wrap around them and create what's called the blood-brain barrier. It prohibits large molecules and nearly all cells from entering the brain. This is good in that an infection elsewhere in your body is unlikely to enter the brain, but also bad because it makes delivering medicine to the brain very challenging, since most medications are large molecules that get interdicted by the blood/brain barrier.\n\nYour regular immune system patrols the cerebrospinal fluid, which circulates between the meninges, very aggressively, but it rarely actually enters the brain. However, the brain has its own internal immune system. This is still a rather new discovery and it remains poorly understood.\n\nThe result of all this is that any bacterial microbiome in the brain would be much smaller, more limited, and probably not closely related to the microbiome of the rest of the body. But currently it's not clear that there even is a bacterial microbiome in the brain. Until very recently it was believed that the interior of the brain was sterile; recent studies dispute this but evidence isn't yet conclusive. The amounts of bacteria found are so small it's hard to prove that they are genuinely residents of a living, healthy brain and not infectious transients or sample contamination.",

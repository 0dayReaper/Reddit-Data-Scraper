This is the \"traditional course\" and usually lasts upwards of 7 days, though depends on the type of infection and antibiotics used. Even if after a few days only such a small amount of bacteria remain, that the patient doesn't feel sick anymore, he should finish the course. The idea here is to ensure, that all the bacteria die, i.e. leave no survivors. Because these remaining bacteria could develop a better resistance vs the antibiotics used, since they came in contact with it. So if people stop antibiotics courses early, the general assumption was this would in the long term reduce the effectiveness of antibiotics. So \"short course\" antibiotics conversely usually last 3-7 days, until the patient feels better. The post you replied to addresses new developments in this field, that suggest this traditional thinking might be wrong and there isn't a difference between short and traditional courses regarding resistances to antibiotics. But there are differences in negative side effects, hence why recommendations about antibiotics use are under scrutiny these days.",

The antibiotic resistance does not arise because of the presence of antibiotics. It already existed in the population and only those that acquired it survived the presence of the antibiotic. And what may have survived could have not even been the original pathogenic organism. So quickly killing off the infection with a short course, and not overly selecting for all the antibiotic resistant stuff and really letting them proliferate while on long duration of antibiotics, could be beneficial. Even if you don't kill off every single pathogenic bacterium causing the infection, you can probably squell most infections well enough.",

The idea is to take a strain of bacteria that carries a plasmid with an antibiotic resistance gene and co-culture it with other bacteria that don't carry the plasmid. Many bacteria naturally take up DNA from their environment and can use the genes encoded in it. In these experiments, low dose antibiotics are given to the bacterial culture over a long period of time so that the bacteria have time to take up the DNA plasmids containing resistance, then evolve to retain and use those plasmids effectively in the long term.\nA large single dose would probably kill all of the bacteria that aren't resistant, providing no time or selective pressure for evolution and spread of residence. \n\nHere is another interesting paper that discuss this type of experimental evolution study:\n\n\"We found that mutations that emerged under strong selection are unstable in the absence of selection, in contrast to resistance mutations previously selected in the mild selection regime that were stably maintained in drug-free environments and positively selected for when antibiotics were reintroduced. \"\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/39/9/msac185/6692293",

People here often want an antibiotic because it's supposedly \"good\", no matter what their actual problem is and whether it makes sense or not. Prescribing something has become a symbol of good medical care. Don't prescribe anything and they'll go elsewhere where they get what they want.  \nPlacebo effects are great, just that bacteria couldn't care less.

As an antibiotic gets less effective/more strains getting resistant, it gets used less and the resistance slowly the reduces, and then it gets used more again as it is more effective.\n\nIt's not to say that antibiotic resistance is not a concern, but with a good variety of antibiotics and *some* stewardship (prevent all people from throwing all antibiotics at something at once), it's not as dire as some news articles claim.",

Likely no difference to controlled places.\n\n\nBut have people pop them every couple of months or more? They will harbour bacteria resistant to all the antibiotics they are using.\n\n\nAnd infections like UTI that stem from your own dermal and intestinal microbiome will be much more difficult to treat.\n\n\n\nSee this study for example: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7296207/\n\nAnd here for an overview:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3543997/\n\n\n\nBasically the easier antibiotics are to obtain, and the harder actual physicians are to access the larger the portion of people colonised by multiple drug resistant bacteria.\n\n\nThis is also complicated by the untegulated nature of the quality of the drug itself.\n\nA low dose, longt term regimen of whatever antibiotic is actually going to be a muuuuch more efficient selective pressure. If you only put enough strain on the system to make it more hardy.\n\nWhereas an aborted high dose regimen poses a smaller problem. After all you just dump a nuke that kills pretty indiscriminately at first, and leave enough non resistant variants alive to quickly recuperate.\n\n\nBut under dosed antibiotics means more money for the vendors, and using too low a dose means the patient is going to take the drug for longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, AMR goes up massively with unregulated markets, however the exact numbers are not easy to come buy. There isn\u2019t even really any good cross population data for western countries. Like research focuses mainly on hospital acquired infections, and people in hospital.\n\nWhat would be needed is a large across population sample having their different microbiomes tested for resistance, and the exact same sampling to be done in various countries to then draw any quantities conclusions.\n\n\nCause obviously numbers in chronically I\u2019ll patients will far overshadow numbers in the average population.",

I come from Sweden, and here there is an organisation which has been promoting restrictive use of antibiotics by physicians for many years. Supposedly they've shown that occurrence of reistant strains is associated with prescription of antibiotics. I can't find the particular graphs showing this, but you can see here https://newsaboutdisease.com/2016/11/15/arbetet-mot-antibiotikaresistens-drabbar-vissa-patientgrupper-i-sverige/ that antibiotics consumed in the nordic countries is much lower than some of the other European countries. Then there's this pdf that shows MRSA and other infections in Europe and globally: https://www.nito.no/contentassets/d93983d08e1240528a2f7f13650ff54d/bioingeniordagen-2017-antibiotikaresistens/10-antibiotikaresistens-i-et-globalt-perspektiv-iren-hoyland-lohr.pdf\nWhich seems to support this theory. \n\nWhat I can't find right nlw is the graph showing that since STRAMA began their campaign many many years ago, some resistant strains appear to have decreased in Sweden. And I think they're campaigns in other countries supposedly are starting to show the same results.\n\nSorry about the long winded way of saying the more antibiotics used, the more resistant strains you get.",

So they sell me the meds anyway.\n\nIf we were to only measure antibiotic use in Romania by what was sold based on a prescription, the statistics would be quite warped from reality.",

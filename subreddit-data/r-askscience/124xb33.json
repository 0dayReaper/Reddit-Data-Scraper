            "comment": "As the author of the referenced paper: I actually still don't know how common salt is in the universe.  Another poster noted the relative abundance of Na and Cl - we have a pretty good sense of how much of each of these elements are out there.   But we can only see NaCl, the molecule, in special locations: the disks around high-mass stars (see also https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2023ApJ...942...66G/abstract) and the dissipating envelopes of dying medium-mass stars (Asymptotic Giant Branch, AGB, stars).  Otherwise, we think NaCl is present, but it is probably in the solid phase and doesn't produce any easily-observable radiation.  When it's in the solid phase, it is part of dust grains, and I don't think we know exactly what it does in the dust (e.g., is it mixed with water in crystals?  or stuck in some silicates?  or something else?).\n\nHigh-mass young star disks and AGB stars are unique in being very warm and dense, which are the conditions needed to have NaCl in the gas phase and able to produce observable millimeter-wavelength radiation.  We *might* see it in one other place, in a hot molecular cloud, but that detection is not confirmed.\n\nThere are some other cool features of molecular salt: there might be salt clouds in hot jupiters, since salt can form at higher temperatures.",

The article OP linked is talking about NaCl detected with millimeter-wave spectroscopy in the disk around a star that is immediately behind M42 (the Orion Nebula).  Since they're along the line of sight, we often say that this object (Orion Source I) is \"in\" the nebula, but we have pretty good evidence that it's actually _behind_ the nebula.  The nebula itself is made of ionized (very hot, ~10,000 K) gas; Source I sits in the Orion Molecular Cloud, which is much cooler (~few hundred K; still warm by molecular standards).\n\nI'm not aware of any microwave detections of NaCl toward the Orion Nebula itself, but I have an observing program ongoing that should pick it up if it's there.  Maybe.",

The NaCl we observed is likely not that hot - probably only ~100K but maybe 1000K (fig 6 of https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJ...872...54G/abstract shows that there's some ambiguity - we measure _two_ temperatures and are not sure how to reconcile them!).  We observe NaCl in an effective vacuum, so the boiling point (more likely sublimation point) is much lower.  That said, it's possible that non-thermal mechanisms are responsible for releasing the NaCl into the gas phase - in other words, the gas isn't at the boiling point, but something knocked the NaCl molecules off the dust grains.  Another possibility is that individual dust grains got very hot briefly, hot enough to vaporize, but again the gas isn't all that hot. We don't know for sure; we haven't yet come up with a consistent model to explain all the observations.\n\nJust to give you a sense of boiling points: water transitions to gas at 373 K at atmospheric pressure.  In the interstellar medium, it sublimates at closer to 100-150K.",

In a cloud that's 100K, the molecular composition will be totally different than a cloud that's 1000K or one that's 10K.  To predict which molecules form, you need a good census of how much gas is in each phase.  We can actually tell that pretty well in galaxies by looking at various molecular and atomic emission lines.\n\nThe limit is actually in our knowledge of the chemistry, though.  While we have good models to predict simple molecules, like CO, CO2, H2O, etc., we have a hard time with more complex molecules because the chemical reaction networks get very complicated, and in many many cases, the reaction coefficients are unknown.  For example, our knowledge of Sulfur-containing molecular chemistry is very poor - there are too many reactions that haven't been measured in the lab, so we don't know what to predict.   There is a lot of work left to be done in astrochemistry!",

I say this mostly because the probability of finding element 1 and element 2 at some point in the universe is certainly less than the probability of finding just 1 or just 2. So, once you've dealt with all the combinations of two or three, whatever's left is unlikely to severely tilt the scales, unless that numbers game really reverses under some conditions. But, I take your point that if we can't describe larger molecules well, it's hard to say whether something more has its finger on the scale. Thanks for the answers!",

You'd be roughly right if molecule formation was just a matter of random chance associations, which is true in the diffuse ISM, but it is not true in dense clouds where molecules form.  A large fraction of all molecules form in clouds that get cold enough that the molecules stick to the surfaces of solid (dust) particles. Once they're there, they're in rich company: there's hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, etc. in abundance - and then more \"normal\" chemical processes (i.e., things you might find happening on Earth) start to take over.  So yes, the numbers game starts to reverse pretty hard!\n\nPurely from gas-phase processes, though, you're basically right; we expect that most molecules with &gt;5 atoms rarely form in the gas phase.  We usually draw the line at methanol, CH_3OH, which is a bottleneck in the formation of more complex molecules.",

Some Na is in other molecules (e.g., NaOH), and some Cl is in other molecules (like HCl).  It might even be integrated into more complex molecules or integrated into crystalline structures (I don't know much about solid state materials; this is someone else's domain).\n\nBut, generally, you're right: we have no direct evidence as to where NaCl is, so I wouldn't claim to know.  It is possible that there's a ton of NaCl sitting on dust grains, undetectable, but it is also possible that there's virtually no NaCl in dust, and it only exists where we see it.  Our best bet, based on what we know of chemistry from lab work, is that Na and Cl are in NaCl on dust grains, but we have never measured that, as far as I'm aware.  It's possible there are measurements from, say, the stardust mission, but I haven't seen those results.",

For that reason, we've been focusing on energy sources on the thinking that regardless of the exact nature or needs of the intelligent species, they will need energy sources to engage in whatever their civilization does.  \n\nTo that end, we have a disagreement on the viability of proton-boron fusion as a sustainable form of energy with particular emphasis on small icy bodies on the outskirts of solar systems (Kuiper belt and Oort cloud bodies).  The disagreement is concerning the relative abundance of Boron.  As you know, Boron is, like Beryllium, mostly NOT formed in stars or left over from the big bang, but rather formed from Lithium and cosmic rays.  I've been arguing that because stellar magnetic fields partially protect objects inside them from cosmic rays, we should, if anything, see MORE Boron in small icy bodies that spend all or most of their time outside stellar magnetic fields, and that therefore there should be more than enough boron to sustain a proton-boron-fusion based civilization in the outskirts of a solar system without ever needing to actually approach a star.  \n\nAm I right?  Do we have any way of knowing how much boron is in such small icy bodies?",

Quasars are accreting black holes, and while there might be some production of heavy elements in their accretion disks, those elements likely do not get returned to the surrounding galaxy to form new stars.  Besides supernovae, neutron star mergers (which another poster already noted) may also produce significant heavy elements, and AGB stars also produce some of the moderately-heavy elements - but with quite a different distribution.  Cartoons like this one https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13873 give a good summary of which routes are responsible for making each.",

Google \"radio galaxies\" and look at those images: they show jets shooting to megaparsec size scales (i.e., 10-100x bigger than galaxies), so that material totally escapes the galaxy.\n\nThat said, there is probably _some_ material from quasars that gets mixed back into the galaxy - I think not that much, but honestly there's a lot unknown about gas cycling in the vicinity of rapidly accreting black holes.  Nevertheless, even if _all_ the accretion disk material got fed back into the galaxy, it would represent a truly tiny fraction of the galaxy's mass, much less than the material made by supernovae (our black hole is 10^6 solar masses, our galaxy is ~10^12 solar masses, of which ~10^11 is baryonic - so the black hole is a tiny fraction of the galaxy, and the accretion disk is a tiny fraction of that.  my numbers here are super rough)",

That means that even though they contain a lot more fuel, they burn through it far more quickly. So for example, a star with two solar masses has roughly twice as much fuel\\* as the sun, but it burns around 13 times as fast, so its lifespan is less than one sixth of the sun's, or maybe around 1.5 billion years\\**\n\nSo if you plug in a star with, say, 20 solar masses, all of a sudden, you're looking at a lifespan of a small fraction of a billion years.\n\n_______________\n\n\\* It gets a bit more complicated in that large and medium stars have a radiative zone at the core (high pressure supressing convection) underneath a convective zone at the surface. Small stars, smaller than the sun, are entirely convective, meaning that they can use the fuel from the entire stellar mass. Large stars have smaller convective zones which don't interface with the core, meaning that they can run out of fuel even if there's a substantial amount of hydrogen in the upper layers of the star. This is why using mass to calculate star lifetimes isn't as simple as using the entire star's mass to look at how much fuel will be fused. This is also why red dwarf stars have exceedingly long lifespans. \n\n\n\\**These are highly handwavey numbers, don't check me on it, but you get the gist.",

None are still around today, and there is only scant evidence that they existed at all.  Obtaining better evidence for this first generation of stars is one of the primary missions of the James Webb Space Telescope.\n\nThe second generation of stars that formed had a middling metallicity, as they formed from material that included the higher-mass elements formed from the first generation of stars.  These were lower in mass on average and lasted much longer, hundreds of millions to billions of years.\n\nOur Sun is a third generation star, which was likely formed from the compression of gas by second-generation stars going supernova.  Third-generation stars like our Sun are much lower mass and higher metallicity, and have much longer lives on average.\n\nAll that being said, we would have obtained a mix of many elements because our Sun (and most second- and third-generation stars) and solar system were almost certainly formed out of gas clouds that had materials from numerous other exploded stars from both the current and previous generation.  The second generation of stars was a lot more diverse than the first generation, and the third generation even moreso, so the diversity of elements that we seen in our solar system today comes from many different kinds of exploded stars in the two most recent generations.\n\nHope that helps!",

If you heat up iron to 3000\u00b0C it stops being a metal and just behaves like any other dense, hot gas. But since hydrogen and helium are so much lighter than other elements they will still have different behaviour at such temperatures (for example, they rise to the surface of a star)",

That means commercial supply goes down and, with constant or increasing demand, price goes up. At some point, it becomes profitable to separate and sell it again, at which point supply increases, price goes down, and the cycle repeats.\n\nThis process is being intensified, especially in creating lower price floors, by long-standing selloffs of nationalized helium reserves that were created when we thought dirigibles were the future of warfare.\n\nhttps://medium.com/a-microbiome-scientist-at-large/science-monday-are-we-really-running-out-of-helium-c5365852cbd3\n\nHelium *is* effectively a non-renewable resource (decay products are created very slowly and need to accumulate over millions of years to be harvestable, besides) and we will run out of it someday, but that day is still very far off and unlikely to happen in the lifetime of anyone alive barring major life extension advancements (yes, please!).\n\nWhat we *will* see is continued boom/bust cycles as reserves are depleted and markets stabilize on current real extraction costs. And it'll likely be a steady increase over time as the long-term depressive effect of stockpile release dwindles.\n\nHelium *can* be synthesized via nuclear reactions and, in a hypothetical situation where the Earth really \"ran out,\" that's what we'd likely end up doing. It'd just be many orders of magnitude more expensive than today and probably make asteroid capture look very appealing. But that hypothetical day is very far off past much more prominent existential threats.",

                    "comment": "(Have read through the first few chapters of Stars and Their Spectra by James Kaler, so most of what I will say is explained in more detail there.)\n\nOn the topic of chemical composition of stars, only cool stars, like M dwarfs or L and T type ultra-cool brown dwarfs can have complex molecules survive in their cores. If the star is any hotter (which is the result of a lot of other variables) only pure elements or hardy molecules with strong bonds can survive that chaotic environment without being ripped apart. For example L-T stars can be identified if their chronosphere contains TiO, which is a) a molecule and b) has titanium, which is heavier than sodium or chloride, so somewhere out there NaCl should exist.\n\nBut as far as we know L-T stars along with white dwarves and type 0 stars make up about 5% of stars in the universe, so not a lot of NaCl should exist in stars both in quantity and spatial spread.\n\nLike you said, detecting chemicals on exoplanets is much more challenging, where NaCl can exist in greater quantities, without being disturbed by immense heat and pressure stellar cores have. We just cannot know for sure, but it is fun to think about! (Which is a very non-sciency way of saying we should be looking into this.)\n\nEDIT: After an experienced scientist chimed in I realized my answer didn't take into account the fact that the molecule itself needs to radiate some energy for us to detect it, or it should absorb some energy from the envelope to create noticeable dips in the spectrum. In either case, it will heat up, not so much to break the molecule, but not as cold as L-T stars would require (about a few hundred kelvin at most). I also didn't base my speculation on any real detection, just wanted to chime in since what I learned about seemed to coincide with this topic. Still leaving this up in case anyone wants to take this info and go on their own rabbit hole. Also, just saw JWST detected some silicate dust in a what looks to be a hot jupiter (VHS 1256 b), so exoplanets being challenging to study might already be changing with JWST's observations.",

                            "comment": "I think you're on the right track that L/T/Y dwarves (brown dwarves) should have cool enough atmospheres to have NaCl in them.  I don't know what references to go to say for sure, though.\n\nOne of the problems isn't just that the salt molecules need to be warm to emit (that's true), but that the wavelengths at which we see their radiation are tough to observe in stars and planets.  The detection we reported was in a disk - which is very, very big compared to a star or planet, and so we could see it at radio/millimeter wavelengths.  We generally can only detect stars themselves at optical and infrared wavelengths, and it turns out that NaCl and KCl  don't have many transitions at wavelengths we usually observe (e.g., https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014MNRAS.442.1821B/abstract).  Most of their strong emission/absorption lines are at &gt;=26 microns, which is just at the edge of what JWST is capable of observing with its MIRI instrument.  No other telescope has observed at these wavelengths with enough sensitivity to pick up salt molecules.  I think there's some possibility JWST will detect salts in either hot jupiters or brown dwarves, though; there are weaker salt lines covering JWST's whole range.  The trick is, there are lots of other molecules that could obscure the salts in an atmosphere - I'm not sure whether we'll be able to identify the molecules cleanly.  It's a much easier job at radio wavelengths.",

In water.\n\nWhat that means is that any body with liquid water in it that also contains masses of salt will dissolve on in the other unless luck keeps them separate.\n\nAnd once it's in it's very very unlikely that chance will separate them again.",

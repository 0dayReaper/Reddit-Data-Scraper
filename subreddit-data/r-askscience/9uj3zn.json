They justify this increase in explosive yield with Fawkes' expertise as someone well versed in the use of explosives for military purposes, though it's not clear how much of a difference it would make. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent) lists the relative effectiveness of black powder as half that of TNT.\n",

Would it be possible to replicate in the place Fawkes' gunpowder was at? Black powder is much more slowly burning than TNT, and how sealed the environment is could be crucial to determine the built up pressure, and thus the damage.\n\nThere is a historic basis how meaningful this is, albeit on a smaller bomb scale. During the [20 July plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20_July_plot), several German officers tried to assassinate Adolf Hitler using a briefcase bomb. To avoid setting off metal detectors, they had to use plastic explosives wrapped in paper rather than a metal casing, despite the fact that at the time of WWII, plastic explosives were not as advanced or high-pressure as later explosives like C4. They expected Hitler to have a conference in a bunker and had the bomb placed there, where the sealed environment would act like one big casing, allowing the bomb to build up pressure that would kill everyone inside. But instead, Hitler had the meeting in a regular building, with windows and other gaps. As a result, the detonated bomb dissipated its explosive force, and Hitler survived the explosion, albeit with some injuries like a shattered eardrum.",

Once it reaches a certain pressure, the casing ruptures and the gas is released. It very quickly expands from it's high pressure/low volume state to the low pressure/high volume state of the atmosphere, and that rapid decompression causes the \"pop\" you hear.\n\nNow, while firecrackers are relatively small with a relatively weak casing, using a larger amount of gunpowder and a stronger casing can cause a more powerful blast. The massive amount of gunpowder used in the plot could easily provide the blast necessary to destroy the building so long as you used a casing powerful enough to contain the blast until a sufficient portion of the gunpowder was burned. Much like the firecracker, once the casing is ruptured, all the compressed gas is released and wants to expand to match the pressure of the atmosphere around it.",

Detonation means the explosion is propagated by a shock front (at the speed of sound through the material iirc), deflagration means the explosion is propagated by heat. Ie: hot gasses streaming through the powder, which is why you usually granulate the powder so the gasses can flow through it better. The grain size controls the explosion speed.\n\nAnd with all gun powder you want a controlled deflagration, never a detonation. In a detonation the energy is released so quickly, most of it would dissipate into the gun itself destroying the barrel.",

The Little Boy bomb is estimated to have only actually detonated about 1.4% or less of the uranium (about 0.91kg, out of a total of 64kg). They were so confident the firing mechanism for the Little Boy would work they literally _didn't bother to test it live_, and instead almost all the development work went into researching how to _stop_ it detonating for long enough that sufficient uranium to do some decent destruction was actually fissioned. \n\n_**NB:** The Little Boy used a gun-initiator firing mechanism that was mechanically simple but didn't maximise explosive potential. The Fat Man bomb used a much more complex implosion-based activator, and it actually required the United States to fly specialists in from England who were experienced in making shaped charges, since at the time British forces were categorically the best in the world at producing shaped charges. This mechanism was MUCH more difficult to develop, and was live-tested extensively._",

The pressure would cause the reaction rate to go up high enough that it would almost certainly be a detonation.

Human bodies are remarkably resilient to short duration overpressure and laymen tend to underestimate just how fast pressure drops off with distance. Without an enclosure like a room to reflect the pressure back or some sort of shrapnel, straight up lumps of high explosive are remarkably ineffective at killing humans for how much energy there is.

He had 2 Kilos, instead of the originally planned 1 kilo as the meetings at the \"wolfsschanze\" got shifted from a bunker to a barack since beginning of that month.  \nThis was the first time Hitler got lucky as the pressure was not as contained as in the bunker.  \nNow the second time he got lucky was when Stauffenberg only was able to get one fuse ready. He then gave the second bomb to his helper. - He actually had help, so his handicap was not as important but the little time they had, as he was faking to put on a new, dry shirt on a hot summer day. -   \nNow, with C1, it is unstable enough that the detonation of the first bomb would have triggered the second bomb as well. Lucky strike number 2!  \nAs for the third time, he lucked out, was that the windows were opened and he was leaning far over the table, looking at a map. The suitcase containing the bomb had also been moved to the him opposing side of the massive table leg.  \n\n\nReally fascinating though is that the planned takeover could still have worked, if they pulled through, as there were reports of Hitler being alive but everybody was uncertain if he really was.

The black regiment supposedly trained specifically for the assault, with extensive drilling and contingency planning that left them well prepared to storm Petersburg immediately upon the explosion. However, they were replaced at the last moment by a white regiment with *no* special training. When the replacements cleared the crater, they had no idea where to go or what to do. Petersburg's defenders were just as shocked as everyone hoped, but due to the Unionist confusion, they had just enough time to throw together an effective defense. Grant said later that if the troops had understood their orders - as the black regiment did - he believed Petersburg would have fallen that day with few casualties on either side. ",

In [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS2GG5HFWrk) they first detonate a 15 lbs shaped charge to dig a hole, then they place a 40 lbs cratering charge in that hole, tamp the earth on it, and detonate that (0:55 in the video). That's what 40 lbs looks like in loosely tamped earth.\n\nA 2750 lbs charge in the equivalent of well-tamped earth would blow the roof off the building and make a nice swimming pool sized crater.",

But still, it's kind of crazy how fast it changed into something far more accessible to how it is today by the time of the enlightenment. Reading Adam Smith has a few anachronisms but is overall really accessible considering it was a formal academic text from 250 years ago.",

Even steel beam construction would have all of the walls and roof blown off, with everyone inside dead.\n\nIt's about 150 cubic feet of powder, so it would explosively expand to about 1.5 million cubic feet of gas, not counting the expansion of air by direct heating.  That's enough to raise a 10,000 square foot building with 15 foot ceilings to 10 atmospheres, or push on every square foot of wall with 21, 000 pounds of force... That's about the weight of 100 cars pushing on each door, for example.\n\n8psi of opverpressure ( roughly 0.5 atmospheres) is the general figure for destruction of buildings, but that's from the outside (from the inside it would take much less) with a good margin, we could say that 1000kg of black powder could demolish a building of about 4,500,000 cubic feet, or perhaps 300,000 square feet with a 15 foot ceiling. \n\nObviously, this grossly oversimplifies the effects of an explosion, but suffice to say that 1000kg of explosives will destroy a very large (enclosed) space.

This means that even when the conditions have been optimised to allow the tetonation of black powder (confinement), it doesn't come anywhere near the effect of TNT. \n\nInterestingly, the German Wikipedia page lists the RE of black powder between 0.25 to 0.4, not 0.5 like the english one. But saying that because he knew how to place the explosives, black powder would have been as efficient as TNT is an unsupported claim.\n\nPersonal opinion : it looks to me like they had a ready-made tool and didn't bother adapting it to answer the question and just said \"let's assume it's 1:1\".",

One would think we could find the \"Recipe\" for gunpowder from the era and replicate it for testing and more specific yield purposes.\n\nI'm guessing they just figured no one would care that much, and the headlines for their research would look better if it was more sensational.\n\n\n\nAlthough, I would argue that \"Fawkes would have Fawked it up\" would have made an equally compelling headline if they found it wouldn't have had enough yield to complete the mission.\n\nEdit:  [Someone has done the math and proper research, should be the top comment, hopefully it gets there.](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/9uj3zn/the_gunpowder_plot_involved_36_barrels_of/e94wsm3/)",

Also Richard Hammond from Top Gear is in it. \n\nNot 2017, made in 2005 apparently. You all are right, Hammond looks way too young for this to be last year. ",

Since the House of Lords was where the targets would be and all of the gunpowder would be in the basement beneath, they only needed to build those two to see how large the explosion would've been.",

            "comment": "Black powder is a low explosive, which means I deflagrates rather the detonates.   What that means in lames terms is explosives are measured in how fast they burn, which is what a conventional explosive does, just at a very rapid speed. So as a low explosive black powder in and of itself is not very destructive when compared to a high explosive. What makes black powder effective is containing it. Contain it in a barrel and it will propel a projectile. Contain it in a pipe and it becomes a mechanical explosion causing damage by way of the pipe breaking at great velocity do to build up in pressure (think coke bottle shaken then tossed up in the air). Because it\u2019s a low brisance (ability to cut) it\u2019s not very effective at damaging hardened structures. The main way it would be effective is if it was able to build up enough pressure in the tunnel or building that it was placed it. And other factors like the building materials, amount of earth it was under etc would all factor in. With that, the quality of black powder and amount of moisture as well. There are instances of huge black powder explosions, and instances of not so huge. There would have to be some real study and testing done to say for sure, but what I can promise is that there is no chance it would have gone unnoticed. I hope that answers a least part of the question. I will clarify where I can, if you have questions. ",

In fact, a low speed explosive is generally better as a \"pushing\" vs \"cutting\" explosive. If you wanted to make steel cutting or counterforce charges to bring down the supports of a building, blackpowder is an awful choice. If you just want to heave up a huge mass of earth, then it does the job just fine.",

ANFO/ANNM as an explosive mixture is mostly ammonium nitrate because that is the proper proportion for the highest performance explosion.  The ammonium nitrate is merely the oxidizer, and in the absence of enough fuel would not detonate at all.  \n\nBlack powder is a much less energetic explosive than ANFO/ANNM, and deflagrates, rather that detonates.  That doesn't mean that exploding barrels of it wouldn't have done plenty of damage, but to compare the Oklahoma City bomb to a bomb composed of self-contained barrels of gunpowder is silly.  ",

A ship will be hit in the powder room, and deflagrate until the searing flame hits the shell magazine and sets off the shell high explosive, and the ship will detonate in a huge explosion. HMS Hood probably went this way.\n\nSince you mention this, I learned recently that the HMS Victory would have carried ~35,000 kg of gunpowder in her magazines. At the time the explosion of a first-rate like her would have been the focus of many paintings and first-hand accounts, such as the explosion of *L'Orient* during the battle of the Nile, 1798, [depicted here.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Phillip_James_De_Loutherbourg_-_The_Battle_of_the_Nile_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg)\n\n&gt;At 21:00, the British observed a fire on the lower decks of the Orient, the French flagship. Identifying the danger this posed to the Orient, Captain Hallowell directed his gun crews to fire their guns directly into the blaze. Sustained British gun fire spread the flames throughout the ship's stern and prevented all efforts to extinguish them. Within minutes the fire had ascended the rigging and set the vast sails alight. The nearest British ships, Swiftsure, Alexander, and Orion, all stopped firing, closed their gunports, and began edging away from the burning ship in anticipation of the detonation of the enormous ammunition supplies stored on board. In addition, they took crews away from the guns to form fire parties and to soak the sails and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting fires. Likewise the French ships Tonnant, Heureux, and Mercure all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from the burning ship. At 22:00 the fire reached the magazines, and the Orient was destroyed by a massive explosion. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond. Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure, Alexander, and Franklin, although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on Franklin.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Nile#Destruction_of_Orient\n\nNow, this explosion involved over 15x as much gunpowder as Fawkes had, but all accounts describe *L'Orient* exploding with some force, at least enough to send debris flying hundreds of feet in the air. Even with less explosives, the result of gunpowder exploding in a contained area such as a magazine or cellar would certainly have the same effect.",

Normally with high explosives, a wave of detonation passes through at a very high speed. Having any form of containment slows the wave down but for high explosives, it doesn't do much as the wave may go at 700 m/s or so  For low explosives using a wave of deflagration rather than detonation, it would be 100 m/s or less. Barrels would constrain the explosion and significantly slow the wave down. Sure the wave would move from barrel to barrel but they would certainly not explode together.\n\nOf course, it would still be a big bang. We know enough of history where powder magazines were set on fire but not as much as having the same quantity in a single container.",

Is that accurate?  Is that how multi-barrel explosions were done at the time? I don't see how fuses could be timed down to the millisecond given the technology of the time, so exploding more than one barrel sounds like an impossibility.\n\nIn that case, the key to a good explosion would be to block any doorway to the room with as much stone or other material to prevent gas from escaping the room through hallways.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;",

Technically a blast wave/shock wave is a type of pressure wave, but I'm willing to concede that was unclear to anyone who wasn't reading my mind. ;)\n\nIf you set off something like HE, then the blast wave will be supersonic simply because of the speed of the reaction and the volume of gas/heat generated. This is because the blast wave is not like a normal wave which is transmitting motion from particle to particle in the fluid, it's a big ass wall of gas being forced forward by the high explosive. If you drive a truck through the atmosphere at Mach 1.5, the air in front of it has to move along with it at least that fast. A detonation can do that with gas instead of a trunk. Once the high explosive stops burning (ie. quite quickly) this will then degenerate to normal sonic speed in the medium, but initial speeds are extremely high. \n\nThis applies to non-HE detonations as well, as it's the same principle of having a very high pressure source forcing the local fluid out of the way. It's just that something like black powder requires specific conditions in order to detonate, whereas HE will detonate in most reasonable ambient conditions (given appropriate initiation). If there's not enough pressure to take the \"blast\" wave supersonic, then it's a deflagration. Which can also be remarkably fast, but is sub-sonic. This is how explosives scientists characterise the difference between a detonation and a deflagration.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflagration_to_detonation_transition\n\nIt is absolutely possible to get waves over the speed of sound in a medium, it just takes unusual circumstances and lots of energy. That's how we broke the sound barrier. Once a wave is in free fluid with no additional energy input it will default to sonic speeds, which is I suspect the situation you're thinking of and you're absolutely correct about that. But as long as there is energy to continually drive the wave speed higher (like an explosion) it can be done.\n\n",

You just have to boil it longer.   \n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/making-water-safe.html](https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/making-water-safe.html)\n\n*Steps for boiling water:*\r  \n*If the water is cloudy, first filter it through a clean cloth, paper towel, or coffee filter OR allow it to settle. Then, draw off the clear water and follow the steps below.*\r  \n\r  \n*1.  Bring the clear water to a rolling boil for 1 minute (****at elevations above 6,500 feet, boil for 3 minutes****).*\n\n*2.  Let the boiled water cool.*\r  \n\n\n*3.  Store the boiled water in clean sanitized containers with tight covers.*",

You need temperatures above 100C to destroy certain bacterial spores. The spores themselves do not cause illness, but can grow back into harmful bacteria like botulinum if the conditions are right. These spores won't grow in acidic environments, which is why tomatoes don't need to be pressure canned. Technically canned tomatoes aren't \"sterilized\", but they are shelf stable. Lots of other foods are shelf stable without being sterile as well. For instance, honey has bacterial spores in it, which are harmless to adults, but can be dangerous for babies as botulinum can actually grow in their guts.",

Thus flight levels, which are essentially the altitude as reported by a pressure-based altimeter set to sea level at 1 atm, will correctly and precisely predict boiling temp, but altitude alone will only give you a ballpark estimate. Pressure altitude can vary from actual geographical altitude by hundreds of feet or in extreme cases and/or high altitudes, over 1000 feet.",

If so, is this why NASA has a [Planetary Protection Office](https://sma.nasa.gov/sma-disciplines/planetary-protection/)?",

                            "comment": "Short version is that bacteria especially archaobacter can live at very high temperatures (think hot springs and sub sea thermal vents (up to \\~350 deg F). The thing is most of those are not pathogens, pathogens grow well at 96 deg F (36 Deg C) so thermophilic bacteria tend not to be pathogenic.  That said as elevation increases and the boiling point of water decreases the ability to kill bacteria also decreases.  So if you happen to be on top of mount Everest (sorry about the queue its a popular destination )  and boil water at 160 deg F for 3 min a lot of bacteria will survive but most of them will not be pathogenic. \n\nEndospore forming bacteria and especially things like *Geobacillus thermophilus* require an incubation temperature of 140 deg F to grow and are in spore form (dormant) prior to this, so they would be happy to live in your higher elevation boiling water.  this is why they are used in test strips for steam sterilizers to prove that the contents have attained the correct temperature.",

It appears there is one settlement at that altitude, La Rinconada, Peru. However, their daily mean temp throughout the year is also within the range of your refrigerator, so they may be safe by things staying so cold.   \n\n\nThen again, if they need hotter, a pressure cooker (which Instant Pot is the most popular version of that now) holds in and builds pressure and can get well over 212 degrees, no matter the altitude (well, I might not test one on Everest, not sure how strong it would be with the pressure differential)",

Once you reach this 80-ish temperature at the Everest base camp, even if you keep on heating it, the water will only evaporate faster, not reach higher temperatures.\n   But even if water is hard capped at a lower boiling point, it's OK, it's still far above the temperature needed to sanitize it. Maybe keep it boiling for a tad longer to be on the safe side, though.",

There is no temperature at a molecular level, only speed.\n\nSo the hotter the water (temperature), the higher the average, so the higher the odds every single bacteria is getting hit by enough fast molecules to kill it.\n\nSame reasoning with water drying: water drying is because while your average speed of molecules is low enough for water to remain liquid (let's say at 30C), some molecules go slow, some go fast. Some go fast enough that they go \"boil\", ie escape your liquid water to fly through the air as gas. That's why water can, ie it turns into gas slowly, even when the temperature is below boiling. The hotter the water, the more water molecules go fast enough to \"escape\" the liquid and turn to gas, that's why hot water dries faster.",

A small correction or technicality that I'll add is that temperature is a measure of the distribution of energy states. This can be generalized to the molecular level if we consider excited vibrational and electronic states. Perhaps more intuitively, temperature is a property of an ensemble (i.e. a group of things) and it helps answer \"where does energy (most likely) flow if another system/state interacts with it\". \n\nIf it interests you, what this refers to is statistical mechanics treatment of thermodynamics. Another useful search term may be the relationship between temperature and entropy.",

The higher fat content and the newly-formed gelatin make the meat super juicy and prevent it from drying out.\n\nhttps://www.americastestkitchen.com/articles/3115-best-internal-temp-chicken-thighs-drumsticks\n\nBut I digress... this isn't /r/AskCulinary haha",

It's all about the temperature. Consider that many bacteria can survive exposure to hard vacuum. If your hypothesis was correct, vacuum would be fatal for bacteria. Also when you're boiling water, most of the water doesn't exceed the boiling point of water, only what's on the bottom exposed to heat. When water is heated and gets to the boiling point, the temperature stops going up, it plateaus, until you add significantly more energy to it, that's why it only boils from the bottom.",

At 165/74 you might not even get many bubbles. You can't tell by looking what the temp is unless it boils.\n* \"Three minutes\" because the killing off of pathogens is not immediate, it takes a little time. That, and it keeps impatient people from grabbing the water the instant one bubble appears - 'three minutes' both gives the needed time and removes some of the ambiguity of what defines \"boiling\"\n\nWhere elevation comes into play is that it does reduce the boiling temp - by the time you get to 25,000 feet (7,600 meters) the boiling temperature of water is about 167F (75C), still enough to sanitize the water though you might want to boil it for five minutes instead of three. And if you are above 25,000 feet and needing to cook/drink in an emergency you have some very big problems of which water is but one. Fortunately there are only about 30 mountains on Earth taller than that, so for most people there is no risk of running into that situation (where boiling temp is too low to sanitize water), and if you are above that height you've not only earned it but you will have learned other ways to handle that problem such as iodine or charcoal.",

Technically the temperature to kill bacteria is below boiling, but having the water boiling both makes sure the entire sample of water is at the correct temperature for the entire duration and lowers the amount of time you need to keep it there for.\n\nTheoretically you could heat water to 70c and keep it stable there for an extended period of time and also have killed everything you kill by boiling it, but it's much more practical and much harder to mess up just bringing it to an obvious boil and keeping it there for a couple minutes.  When the altitude is higher and thus the boiling temp is lower you just generally want to increase the time you leave it boiling.\n\nSide note: boiling kills most bacteria and viruses.  But not all.  Some form spores that protect them from prolonged heat and even dead ones can leave toxins behind if they were thriving (for example killing botulism in a canned food does little to keep you from getting sick when they've already been releasing their toxin into the food for an extended period of time, which is why you throw out bulging cans instead of just making sure you cook them well).  So if the water looks contaminated visually, smells, etc, you should still avoid it unless you don't have a choice but to boil it and hope that's good enough.",

If you move any higher than that it doesn't matter how much energy you put in our house long you cook it for because the water will never reach the minimum temperature.\n\n\nOf course you can still play with *pressure* by artificially increasing it - seal the container, pump more atmosphere in, etc. In fact that's how pressure cookers at lower altitudes work - by increasing the internal issue you can go to higher temperatures because the energy can't go anywhere.\n\n\nAnd then things go boom.\n\n\nConversley you can draw pressure *out* of a container and also *lower* the boiling point - with a couple pieces of equipment you can make a glass of water \"boil\" at room temperature.",

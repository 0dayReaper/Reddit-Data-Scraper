He has a video or two that talk about hot and cold treatments with other researchers, which will give you a lot of info to include uses/benefits and protocols.\n\nOne thing I do remember as far as ice baths and fitness is that, while there are a lot of other benefits, it reduces inflammation. This can be good if you are say mid season of a given sport and you need to reduce inflammation to continue playing, but not good if you are trying to build muscle since reduced inflammation will negatively effect hypertrophy and maybe other improvements fitness areas. This being if you do cold exposure after a training session. I think they said doing it earlier in the day you won't have these effects.",

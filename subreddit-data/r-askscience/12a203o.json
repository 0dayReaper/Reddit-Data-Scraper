            "comment": "&gt; Can two sexually incompatible species evolve in a convergent manner to a become a sexually compatible species?\n\nGenerally speaking, when we talk about species, we're talking about the ability of one member of a group to breed with another.  \n\nThere's hybridization, as well as obligate endosymbiosis.  \n\nHybridization is most common when a species group is diverging, such as with donkeys and horses, where the mismatched genetics are able to produce offspring.  Mules and hinnies, in this case.  The majority of their genome still lines up, but eventually horses and donkeys will likely drift apart enough that they won't be able to produce mules at some point.  It is unlikely that horses and donkeys and mules will ever become the same species like their last common ancestor.  The kinds of mutations that would lead to this simply aren't likely to happen, and are actually quite likely to not happen, because of the way progeny works.  This is kinda the opposite of what you're asking, one species becoming more than one. All species are transitional, after all.  If we split the whole of humans in half, and put half of us on a different planet, after some amount of time the humans here and the humans there would not be able to produce offspring together anymore.  This would probably take tens or hundreds of thousands of years, or maybe longer.  Sometime between when we split and stopped interbreeding, to when we became two distinct species, we could potentially produce a third, hybrid species of human, much like how a horse and a donkey can have a mule (3 different species).  \n\nThen there's things like obligate endosymbiosis.  The most famous example is probably the ancestors of the mitochondria in your cells.  Well, they're in basically all plant, animal, and fungus cells, in fact, because the symbiosis happened a very long time ago, long before animals and plants and fungus delineated (probably).  This sort of gene transfer isn't sexual though, it's more like our ancestors cells happened to eat some mitochondrion and boom, instead of digesting the thing it just kinda kept it around, the genes traded back and forth and some happened to line up, and the next time the cell divided it made a copy of the mitochondrion with it.  At first it probably wasn't obligate, so if the host cells died, the mitochondrion would live another day to be eaten by a different cell.  Or if the mitochondrion died, the cell might well find another or eat another cell with one already in it.\n\nSo now that we've got those basic precursors out of the way, let's move on to the heart of your question:\n\n&gt; could dogs and foxes be breed in such a way so that there could be a descendent species of both dogs and foxes?\n\nI think your question is something along the lines of \"could we breed a group of dogs/wolves and a group of foxes such that we could eventually make their genes line up in a way that would produce fertile/not dead offspring?\"\n\nThe answer is 100% no.  Foxes have 16 pairs of acrocentric chromosomes, dogs have 38 pairs of metacentric chromosomes.  A great many things would have to change on both sides, and by the time you made changes that drastic, you would have entirely new species from current dogs or foxes.  Convergent evolution is also phenotypical, not genotypical.  Two species can share traits (four legs, hairy bodies, tails, and so on) but the genes that code for those traits can be 100% different, in different places (foxes have half the chromosomes of dogs, for example: genetic expressions would never match up). \n\nLet's look at horses and donkeys again for comparison, two species that can interbreed at the moment.  Horses have 64 chromosomes, donkeys have 62.  Mules end up with 63.  The majority of the horse and donkey genome is interchangeable, shared between the two species. However, even when two species are this similar, we still couldn't breed horses and donkeys in such a way to bring their genetics 100% back in line.  The things that are expressed differently are what make them horses or donkeys, foxes or dogs.  Two horses that breed together, for example, will always maintain 64 chromosomes, and they'll be more-or-less identical in presentation to the parent with which they share their sex markers.  The likelihood of two horses breeding and producing an offspring with 63 chromosomes in their offpsring in exactly the same way as a pair of donkeys breeding and producing also 63 chromosomes in their offspring, and both of these producing viable offspring with one another is zero.  It's not close to zero, but rather, it is functionally impossible, for reasons we won't get into today.  Look up sex chromosomes addition/deletion, autosomes addition/deletion, hybrid incompatibility, for more interesting reading.",

Echidna, Horses, skunks and chinchilla all have 64 chromosomes.  Remember how horses and donkeys can make mules but are different by two.  Humans have 46, coffee trees have 44.  The Nilgai, an antelope in Asia, has 46.\n\nHowever, the number isn't the only important thing.  Each chromosome can have a different kind of termination.  The two broad categories are telomeres (they make the chromosome look kinda like a V) and centromeres (multiple varieties, make the chromosome look like an X).\n\nThe length of the chromosome varies. In horses and donkeys, most of the ones they share are similar enough that they match up 1:1 (more or less).  The ones that aren't matches cause the differences we see between horses and mules, for example.\n\nWith something like foxes and dogs, the ones they share in common are still very close to identical, just like with the horses and donkeys.  However, the proportion they share is tiny by comparison.  See the link.  The scaffold mapping for example shows that 84% of Fox genes code to one dog chromosome.  I don't know much about the specifics of Fox and dog genomes, but in general you can think of it like cars.  A motorcycle and a semi are going to share some parts in common, but the semi is gonna have many more parts, and the parts that are the same aren't necessarily gonna work from one to the other.  Motorcycle and semis both have tires, but they can't share.  If I asked you to build a new cemi or motorcycle from the parts they have in common, you probably couldn't.  Both have engines, but you're not gonna fit the valves from a Harley in a Freightliner engine.\n\nHorses and donkeys on the other hand, are like two different cars that are somewhat similar.  A Mustang and a Dart aren't the same car, but you can use most of the parts from one directly in the other, but one has more parts.  If I asked you to build a new car from the parts they share in common, you might use most of the parts on either car, but you might have a few parts that are only in one car that's missing from the other.  They both share the same engines, in this case, but maybe the clutch plate would not fit perfect.  The car would still move, even though it's no longer a Mustang or a Dart.\n\nSame idea with chromosomes.  They not only have to match type and length, but the scaffolds have to be compatible and so on.  Dog and Fox chromosomes aren't directly compatible at all, no more than humans and coffee beans.\n\nhttps://www.patentdocs.org/2018/09/red-fox-genome-sheds-light-on-domesticated-dogs-and-maybe-humans.html\n\n&gt;I don't know if some bacteria reproduce sexually, but if so, same question. \n\nThis is also a good question.\n\nBacteria, viruses, they largely reproduce asexually but they can engage in horizontal gene transfer.  Bacteria can just split into new bacteria, for example. Viruses are not alive, but they can inject DNA/RNA into things like bacteria, and so reproduce by destroying the host. Sometimes they acquire genetic info from the host, sometimes the host survives and takes the new material with it.  That's a general, basic explanation and there are all kinds of exceptions to it.\n\n&gt;Could you take a group of one bacteria and another group of a different bacteria (who initially make infertile/dead offspring) and breed them to match up their genes?\n\nMatch? No, probably not.\n\nBacterial conjugation is probably the closest thing to what you're trying to find.",

            "comment": "Yes, quite possibly. We can actually see this in nature (although usually we see it going in the opposite direction)\n\n\nSo we have examples, in birds for instance, where there are northern, central, and southern species. If you take a bird from the far north, and one from the far south, they will not interbreed. However, both northern AND southern birds will interbreed successfully with the central species.\n\nYou could imagine, if you took all three species and plopped them onto an island together, you could eventually go from 3 species back to 1.\n\n\nThere is a bit of a problem with this happening in nature in most cases, and we usually see the direction of evolution moving species apart, not closer together.\n\nImagine that you have 2 species that are defined by 2 genes. Each gene can take a value from 1-10, and both genes have to be the same in order for the species to interbreed.\n\n\nSO, if our first species is a 5-5 gene, and the second species is a 5-5 gene, then they can interbreed.\n\nHowever a single mutation in euther species will cause them to not be able to breed. So given that a mutation might happen, it is highly likely the two species will not be able to interbreed.\n\n\nLets look at the reverse. We start out with 2 species, a 5-5 species just like last time and a 5-1 species. Now, because the genes are different, they cant interbreed. If we assume there is a random mutation in any one of the four genes what is the liklihood that the species will converge and be able to breed again?\n\n\nFirst, the mutation has to occur in the second gene of imeither species, which is 50%. If a mutation occurs in the first gene, then the pair will get further apart.\n\nNext, we have a 1/9 chance for the mutation to change the second gene to the correct one for interbreeding.\n\nSo in this super simple example, we have 2 species that are very close to each other. If there IS a mutation, there is only a 5.6% chance the mutation will successfully bring the two species closer and a 94.4% chance the mutation would bring the species farther apart.",

Something like that, theorically not impossible, just not something you think can ever happen.\n\nThrough breeding, given an infinite amount of time, technically possible. Same if you kick sand an infinite amount of time it will turn into a sand castle at some point. Most likely youd need to be able to check the animals genomes, to select the ones that are going in the right direction. But if you're doing that, you might as well just edit their genomes to make a hybrid and call it a day.",

There are a lot of things that have to match up for reproduction to be possible\n\nSomebody above give the example of neanderthals and homosapiens, as if that was divergent and then reconvergence. But that to me is a bad example\n\nThe enderthals and homosapiens had a common ancestor relatively recently, and if crossbreeding occur there was more like dogs still being able to breed with wolves. They are no longer the same species, but they are similar enough genetically from their recent common ancestors that they still can't. They are very very very much cousin species\n\nFor two species that have developed to the point where they are no longer able to interbreed to somehow switch back to being able to breed again would be fantastically unlikely. Outside of some sort of genetic or other manipulation of the scientific level\n\nFor two species that don't share recent common ancestor to develop in such a way that they could reproduce together would be nearly inconceivable. Nothing is literally impossible in an infinite universe, but the odds would be astronomically small.",

It seems that split between the ancestors of foxes and dogs happened so long ago that their chromosomes have drifted too far apart,\n\nIf we imagine that, that wasn't the case, there's another problem. Dogs an foxes have a different number of chromosomes.  \nIn order to make a living hybrid you also need enough of the most important chromosomes to match up with at matching partner from the other parent. If that's not possible then hybridisation is impossible.\n\nIt's for the same reason that you can't make a chimp and human hybrid.  \nChimps have one more chromosome than humans have.  \nTwo of the chromosomes found in chimps are fused into one chromosome in humans which is why we have one less than they do, and apparently it's an important one.",

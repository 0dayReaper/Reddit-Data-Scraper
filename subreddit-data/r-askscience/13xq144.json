Does this peak and subsequent drop-off reflect actual changes in number of cases, or new thresholds in identifying cancers, or just new ways of counting the data, etc?",

For two decades, therefore, men by the thousand have been diagnosed with and treated for prostate cancer in the belief that PSA saves lives, despite a paucity of evidence that it actually does so.\n\nThis is the last sentence:\n\n&gt;Only because of the much-advertised belief that early detection saves lives \u2013 as is true in the case of mammography, but may or may not be true in that of PSA \u2013 has the PSA system flourished despite the doubts that shadowed it from the beginning.\n\nOne comment I would make about this sentence is that, if an intervention actually saves a significant number of lives, it ought to be detectable after 2 decades of widespread use.\n\n___\n\nI have no doubt that you are right that the substantial rise in incidence followed by a return to a flat curve at a higher level is related to the rise in PSA screening.",

We started screening (in 1987, as cited in the exact line that link takes you to in the article), so a lot more cases were caught, including a backlog of unknown cases. Once that was caught up on, the rate dropped back down, but to a higher plateau than before since there are more people being tested.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;Prostate-cancer screening was introduced in the United States in 1987 \u2013 when the use of mammography was already rising rapidly \u2013 to be followed in short order by a dramatic increase in detected cancer. \n\nUncertainty of effectiveness of testing and treatment is kinda a side thing to the question OP asked.",

Colon cancer has a lower survivability rate (63-91%) than prostate cancer (97%).\n\nColonoscopies had the benefit of optical scope and biopsy improvements. The introduction of routine colon cancer stool and blood testing has helped catch cases earlier.\n\nI wonder if removing parts of the colon is likely more problematic than removing testicles or if this is still just an issue of early warning signs that get people motivated to be seen.\n\nhttps://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/colon-rectal-cancer/detection-diagnosis-staging/how-diagnosed.html",

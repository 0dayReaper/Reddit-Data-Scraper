Is there any way of estimating this? I would assume there is probably some skew in trees but I can't seem to find any information that is easily comprehensible.",

They\nmature first as functional male fish and then undergo\nsex change to become female. Studies have shown\nthere is a relationship between size and sex. Most\nbarramundi mature as males at about 50 to 60\ncentimetres and start to change sex at around 80\ncentimetres, but only if they are living in marine waters.\nIn freshwater impoundments, such as Manton Dam in\nthe Northern Territory and Tinaroo Dam in Queensland,\nbarramundi were introduced for the enjoyment of\nrecreational fishers. Here, you can find barramundi\nweighing over 20 kilograms and over 100 centimetres\nlong, however they are all males. Because of this,\nrestocking is the only way to replenish barramundi\npopulations in these freshwater impoundments.\nIt is believed that saltwater triggers sexual maturity in\nmales and that they need to spawn at least once before\nchanging into females.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDIT: Also crocodiles, alligators and many other reptiles are sex-selected by the incubation temperature of their eggs. So one year for a species you may get all males or all females due to temperature extremes. Edit2 - I see u/WhoLetTheFrogOut has covered this in more detail",

But, birds, some fish and crustaceans, some lizards and butterflies and moths have a Z W system. In the Z W chromosome arrangement, females are ZW and males are ZZ.  \nAdditionally, I believe some species are fully parthenogenetic (females only), and in some species, the Y chromosome of males has been lost and/or replaced by other chromosomes. Finally, even in humans, there are various intersex conditions such as XXY.",

So any understanding you have of sex determination that involves X and Y will be not useful in trying to understand different systems. \n\nAlso the Y chromosome's origin dosen't have any bearing on what happens during development. Just because the Y came from the X doesn't mean males come from females it just happens to be the case in humans that during development humans kinda play out like that. \n\nAlso you're replying to a post talking about a species that is effectively all Male at birth.",

The sex of their offspring is determined by the temperature of the beaches the eggs are buried on - the warmer it is, the more females are born (if the eggs hatch successfully at all, as increased heat also decreases the hatchling success rate). The worst case scenario sees turtles unable to adapt their behaviors fast enough to compensate, thus being unable to lay their eggs earlier when it\u2019s cooler and producing a sufficient number of males.",

This slowly raised or dropped their waters temp to make it less of a shock.\n\nThe bags float because of air. The bag had to have air or else they fish will die. So when you bag them you leave about 1/3 of the bag just air, puffed up by quickly closing it. Some places even have a little air pump and nozzle that they use to fill it more fully. This also doubles as protection for the fish since the bag wont collapse and stress them fish or kill them.",

There's a response above about Lion King stating (accurately) that Nala was likely also Mufasa's child, with at best another mother who's likely Simba's aunt, as lion prides have a single male and multiple females. Stray cats will breed with their own children or siblings given a mating season in the same area.\n\nDoes inbreeding cause problems in animals? Sometimes, yes, for sure. But the animal kingdom is also largely crueler than human society. We know X royal family had massive hemophilia problems from inbreeding because we mostly went through extensive efforts to keep them alive despite it. Animals will have dozens of offspring and those with undesirable traits will die off almost immediately and not reproduce. So this weeds those traits back out again within a few generations, and we don't really notice because they're just animals dying out of our sights. We DO however see a lot of problems in domesticated purebred cats and dogs because we keep them close enough to see the problems and expend effort keeping them alive through it.",

Human royal dynasties didn't have a single generation of sibling/cousin marriage and suddenly developed health problems, it was centuries of repeated inbreeding that led to these health problems. \n\nEven in animals where one individual controls a harem of many of the opposite sex, there will be more than one such harem within a reasonable travel distance as well as cheaters that find ways to bypass the ruling individual and still mate with the harem.",

There's only so many different genes in a related pairing. So, a bad gene that wouldn't show up when paired to a good gene has a higher likelihood of pairing with another bad gene when the two parents are related. And then the next generation has even fewer different genes. And so on. \n\nWe get around it with animals by culling ruthlessly. Animals with deformities, when they crop up, don't get bred on. The animals that are fine, do. Nature does this too. Wild animals with bad genes die. \n\n\nSome other fun facts: the majority of lab animal strains are so inbred they are almost clones. They need consistency in reactions and morphology, and they accomplish this through inbreeding. Sometimes, the goal animal is bred with a defect in mind- ie mice with alzheimers or rats with cancer(this is why pet rats are prone to cancer, BTW. They come from lab rats). Elsewhere, we see inbreeding used to fix traits or deformities in domesticated animals. White tigers, dairy production, smush faced dogs and cats, any color variations, egg production, hunting ability, etc, are all the products of inbreeding. Wild animals with unusual patterns are also likely to be inbred.",

This has been disproven, but the original thinking was that if a male lion coalition takes over a pride of females, they cannot sit around and wait until the cubs are grown and the females then become receptive again. Better to kill the cubs that are not theirs, and start a new generation that is theirs \u2013 as male coalitions have a limited time with the prides. Male lions do kill cubs when they take over a pride, but it is not as prevalent as some would have us think. Females already pregnant when the new males come in can easily \u201cdisguise\u201d their cubs as belonging to the new males, and even females with newly born cubs can hide them, mate with the new males, and bring their cubs out later.

Nor do they have X and Y (or Z, for birds) sex determinators.  They have sex determining loci on their DNA.\n\nThat would be Fungi.\n\nSome of the more common mushrooms have more than 17,000 sexes, and they have varying rates of reproductive success with each other.  The sexes aren't distributed evenly.  In fact, some of them may be collapsing or expanding due to another weird ability some fungi have - they can extend hyphae into the systems of other fungi (and bacteria, which is WILD because that's a whole different kingdom!) and steal clipped pieces of their DNA, basically yoinking things randomly.  At least, I hope it's randomly.\n\nThis also means that Fungi can occasionally be cross-compatible in ways that more simple sex-determinating groups cannot be.  You could never cross a goose and a horse.  But if the right fungi steal enough from each other AND have the right mix of sexes, it's possible they could eventually be compatible.\n\nAt the moment the sheer number of sexes is thought to be a way that a particular fungus can avoid fertilising itself too much - that the spores aren't all compatible, so it can reach more variation, but fungi keep doing some really weird things so it's hard to tell.",

The later in the season hatches when the water is warmer result in more males because they: \nA. Hit maturity faster\nB. A single male can fertilize vast quantities of eggs. \n\nSo in captivity it's possible to skew populations by changing spawning conditions. \n\nThis isn't an exact example of your question, but interesting nonetheless.\nIt's been a bit since I did work with them so if I'm off base please correct me.

The reasons for this are kind of unclear, but it obviously impacts infant mortality.\n\nAt term, they have higher birth weights than girls on average, as well as larger head circumferences. Being larger increases their risk of labor complications.\n\nIn general, men fare worse than women when fighting infectious disease. Women have much stronger immune systems. This is true of babies as well, and gives little girls better outcomes if they catch dangerous diseases early in life, before they have been vaccinated. (Interestingly, this is probably also why women are more likely to have autoimmune diseases. There's a downside to strong immune responses).",

Many genes are only present on the x chromosome, not the y, so if they get a bad copy of the gene from the x chromosome they don't have another copy of the gene present on the other x chromosome to supply instructions. This kills more of them early, in the embryo and infant stage.\n\nBut yes, later on the higher mortality is associated with higher risk- taking behavior. I've heard it referred to as \"testosterone poisoning\" but I don't think you can really separate what behavior is caused by hormones from what is societally encouraged.",

I've heard it referred to as \"testosterone poisoning\"\n\nI think this term is potentially demonizing a function that evolved with a purpose and still has its place today. Men do have higher death rates for a variety of reasons, culture, more dangerous jobs, and traditionally the ability to perform those jobs better than women can due to physical differences on average, and partly because 1. Male skeletal structures, muscles, and bodies can exert more physical force and stamina, and 2. A big one - doing things like hunting, exploring, laboring in the mine, etc. are extremely difficult while pregnant. Men have also almost universally been the fodder thrown at War and conflict.\n\nTestosterone and risk taking behavior help with all of those things. In the modern world, risk taking behavior is still a high risk High reward scenario in many cases. (And there are analogous sex-differences for women as well with both pros and cons.)\n\nRather than suggesting men inherently have some sort of detrimental poison in them just because of their sex chromosome, I think it would be better to understand sex differences like these as their own proclivities with their own unique set of benefits and risks that we should learn to mediate as we grow.",

During spring and summer, these females reproduce by live-birth parthenogenesis, and often even give birth to pregnant females, allowing the population to explode. \n\nWhen autumn rolls around though, these female aphids start producing a mix of female and male aphids (they use a XO sex-determination system, so male aphids simply have a single X chromosome). The male and female aphids then mate and  produce the eggs that will generate new female aphids in the spring.",

            "comment": "Yes, there are sexually reproducing species that have a significantly skewed sex ratio at birth. For example, in some reptiles such as the common snapping turtle, Chelydra serpentina, the sex of the offspring is determined by the temperature at which the eggs are incubated. Eggs incubated at higher temperatures produce more females, while eggs incubated at lower temperatures produce more males. As a result, the sex ratio of snapping turtle hatchlings can be skewed towards one sex or the other depending on the temperature of the nest.\n\nAnother example is the honeybee, where the queen bee controls the sex of the offspring by selectively fertilizing the eggs. Unfertilized eggs become males (drones), while fertilized eggs become females (workers or queens). In some cases, the queen bee may produce more males or more females, leading to a skewed sex ratio in the colony.\n\nIt's difficult to estimate the sex ratio of all sexually reproducing species alive right now because it varies widely between species and can even be influenced by environmental factors. For example, in some species of birds, the sex ratio may be skewed towards males because male embryos develop faster in the egg, giving them an advantage in hatching. In other species, the sex ratio may be more even, or even skewed towards females.\n\nIn plants, the sex ratio can also vary depending on the species and the environment. Some plants, like some species of asparagus, are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female plants. The sex ratio in dioecious plants is usually 1:1, but it can be influenced by factors such as temperature, nutrient availability, and pollinator behavior.\n\nOverall, estimating the sex ratio of all sexually reproducing species alive today is challenging due to the vast diversity of species and the many factors that can influence sex ratios.",

They have two pollen production types (Protandrous, and Protogynous) such that protandrous trees tend to pollinate protogynous trees and vice versa.  A single dominant gene determines if a tree is protogynous.  Natural populations of pecans tend to reach a static balance where @half the trees are protogynous and @half are protandrous.  If more protandrous trees survive in a given area, they tend to be pollinated by protogynous trees such that resulting offspring are more likely to be protogynous.  It is all a matter of timing.  Why do pecans have heterodichogamy?  It is a mechanism to avoid self-pollination.  There are still examples where self-pollination occurs with one major cultivar, Mahan, that is homozygous protogynous.\n\ntldr: pecans tend toward half protandrous and half protogynous due to their mechanism to avoid self-pollination.",

Because many species have nearly equal amounts of parental expenditure between individual males and females, this means that most species will have nearly equal sex ratios in terms of numbers.\n\nAn easy proof of Fisher's Principle in the case of species that have equal parental expenditure between individuals of each sex: Assume that one sex is under-represented. Then the under-represented sex has better mating prospects. Thus, genes that produce this under-represented sex will be more successful, which means more of the under-represented sex will be produced. But the benefit decreases as the ratio approaches equality.",

That means that swings in weather can make big population swings.  \n  \nHaploid determination, like for bees and ants, tends to have very high skew: over 90% of honeybee's are female.",

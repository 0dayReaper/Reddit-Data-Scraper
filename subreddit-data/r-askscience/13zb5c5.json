            "comment": "The full outer shell rule as a predictor of reactivity is only really a rule of thumb for lighter elements.\n\nMolecular orbital (MO) theory is a more thorough predictor of reactivity. Within MO theory framework, for a bond to form electrons need to be occupying bonding orbitals over anti-bonding orbitals. The more electrons in bonding orbitals the stronger the bond.\n\nElectrons in metals form delocalised bands (continuum of states) with a defined Fermi energy. States below the Fermi energy are occupied. So if a reacting molecule forms combined orbitals with the metal bands, and these molecule + band states are below the Fermi energy, they are occupied.\n\nDue to electron shielding as one moves across a period and electronic relativistic effects, the bands in gold are fairly low in energy below the Fermi energy. This causes the resultant anti-bonding orbitals formed with reacting molecules to be below the Fermi energy and thus occupied. This leads to weak or no bonding.

                    "comment": "Let me try to put this in laymen's terms. (Key word here is \"try.\" You really need to have taken a year of chemistry somewhere in your life to understand this.)\n\nIn molecular orbital theory (one of the (if not THE) best theories used to explain how molecules bond,) there are things called \"bonding orbitals\" and \"anti-bonding\" orbitals. \n\n\nIf you remember from chemistry class, orbitals are simply specifically shaped areas around the nucleus of an atom where pairs of electrons will reside. Why do the electrons stay in these orbitals? Because math that's far to complicated to talk about here. Remember, electrons don't stay in \"orbits\", they stay in \"orbitals.\" Remember s, p, d, and f orbitals? Well, with molecular orbital theory, the individual s, p, d, and f orbitals from the atoms are combined into \"molecular\" orbitals.\n\n\nImagine a benzene ring(six carbon ring with double bonds every other bond.) We know the orbitals are delocalized on the top and bottom of the ring due to resonance. (Basically the electrons can move freely anywhere on top and bottom because all of the individual p orbitals pointing up and down combine into a few LARGE orbitals that cover the entirety of the molecule.) That's why benzene is so stable! \n\n\nAnyway, due to... *math* the \"bonding orbitals\" are areas between the two atomic nuclei that electrons will reside in. If electrons are BETWEEN the nuclei, they end up making the nuclei attract to each other. The more electrons that reside BETWEEN the nuclei, the stronger the attraction will be. \n\n\nHowever, there are also ANTI bonding orbitals. These orbitals place the electrons OUTSIDE the two nuclei. Like, not in between them. This causes the nuclei to want to separate.\n\n(The reason bonding orbitals make them want to bond is just simple electrostatic attraction. Electrons are negatively charged, protons are positively charged. If you have electrons BETWEEN two positive charges, the electrons will attract (aka hold onto) both positive charges. If you only have electrons on the OUTSIDE of two positive nuclei, they won't attract each other (because they're too far away from the opposite nuclei) and only serve to \"get in the way\" of other electrons (who are negatively charged) and therefore want their nuclei to move away from the other nuclei so they can have more room.))\n\n\nIf you want to have a stable bond, the forces from the bonding orbitals need to overcome the forces from the antibonding orbitals. \n\n\nAs you add electrons, you fill the orbitals from lowest energy to highest energy. So if you have a lot of electrons (like gold does) there are a lot of bonding AND antibonding orbitals that are full. \n\n\nIf the antibonding orbitals are FULL, well then it's going to be hard to bond anything to that molecule.\n\n\nNow how does this relate to gold? Well gold has particularly low energy bonding orbitals (so they don't hold together very strongly) and particularly high energy antibonding orbitals (so they really want to fall apart.)",

Depending on how many electrons an atom has, the electrons clump up into differently shaped gloopy clouds. Some are just vaguely bubble shaped, others make funny donuts, or get pinched up like bows on a wrapped present. Some are to the sides and others are up and down. More electrons means more funny shapes of clouds.\n\nWhen atoms try to come together to make molecules, the shape of the gloopy clouds determines which atoms like to come together. Sometimes the clouds end up between the nuclei of the atoms coming together. Nuclei like having electrons around, so if both nuclei end up with both of their gloopy clouds in the same place between them, the combined gloopy cloud of electrons acts like a sort of glue, holding the atoms together.\n\nHowever other electrons may form gloopy clouds that are NOT between the nuclei of the atoms. Those gloopy clouds pull away from the other atoms, making it harder to get glued together, or easier to break the glue.\n\nElements like gold have less glue gloops than it has pull-away gloops. That is, it has thinner clouds of electrons between it and other potential partner atoms, than it has in other places. The clouds in other places make it want to pull away from other atoms, instead of gluing them together due to their shared gloopy electron clouds.",

                                    "comment": "I'll try as well.\n\nYou are probably familiar with the \"classical\" model of an atom: a bunch of balls smooshed together, and then tiny balls orbiting around them. The \"smooshed\" piece is the nucleus; it is made of neutrons and protons. Protons have positive charge, and neutrons have 0 (or neutral) charge. The tiny balls whizzing around are electrons, and they have negative charge. Atoms *tend* to (but not always) want to have the total charge be neutral (so positive proton charges negated by negative electron charges).\n\nWell, this model of the atom is actually not very correct for a few specific reasons. The gist of it is that quantum mechanics was discovered... that basically killed the classic model right then and there. Quantum mechanics tells us a few important things:\n\n1. At the smallest of smallest scales, energy actually comes in discrete packets. These packets are called \"fundamental particles\". Electrons are one of these kinds of particles. When we talk about \"discrete packets of energy\", it is said to be \"quantized\". Its a funky word, but the main idea is that energy actually has *is not* continuous. If I ask you how fast your car is going while you step on the gas pedal, you could say 2.1 mph, 3.8 mph, 4.6 mph, etc as you go faster. This would be a continuous change. Well, these fundamental particles actually ***must*** be *specific* energies, and nothing else.\n\n2. These \"particles\" are actually not tiny little marbles whizzing about. Because, at its lowest level, these particles are just packets of energy, this energy is actually a *wave*, and wave properties actually apply. Its just the individual packet of energy is so tiny that at our super-giant scale, we see it as a little tiny ball of matter.\n\n3. The wave properties of these particles actually makes it *literally impossible* for us to know *precisely* where in space they are, and their momentum at the same time (this is called the \"uncertainty principle\"). There's a lot of important and complicated math that goes into coming to this conclusion, but the important take-away is that we actually have to make predictions based on probabilities, rather than deterministic means. If you throw a ball, and you know the angle and speed, you can calculate exactly where it should land. This is *not* true at these extremely small scales. *Everything* is governed by probabilities. Because these particles have wave properties, the probabilities also are governed by equations derived from wave-like behavior. One famous example is the Double Slit Experiment. Essentially, electrons were shot, one at a time, at a screen that would glow at the spot it was hit. Over the course of hundreds of shots, the final picture actually showed an interference pattern. In other words, the *probabilities* of where the electron would hit acted like a wave that could be recreated given the double-slit geometry.\n\n4. Particles of the same type *hate* being near each other. Imagine two twins; they have distinct personalities, and would probably be offended if you confused one for the other. Particles are similar. The math can get really hairy here, but the gist is that if you assign certain numbers describing energy, charge, and linear and angular momentum, no two particles can share the exact same set of these numbers. Remember, we can't know for certain *where* a particle is or its momentum at the same time, so basically, these numbers are all we have to tell any two particle apart. But, then, that means any two particles with these same numbers could potentially be at the same spot at the same time, and we just said they hate that. One electron with the same numbers would rather go to a higher energy level than be \"confused with\" another electron. This is called the \"Pauli exclusion principle\".\n\nOk, so what?\n\nWell, instead of tiny marbles whizzing around the nucleus, we can't actually \"picture\" what the electrons are doing. We instead picture the *probability of finding* an electron somewhere in space near the nucleus. With more electrons, these shapes can start looking pretty funky.\n\nInstead of \"orbits\", these \"clouds of probability\" are called \"orbitals\". They are literally just a representation of the probability of finding an electron in space. Remember, these probability clouds are still waves, even if more \"abstract\". So they can interfere!\n\nWhere the orbitals of two atoms come together and *constructively interfere*, this is called a bonding orbital. Where they *destructively interfere*, this is called an anti-bonding orbital. Think of splashing about in a pool. As the waves bounce around, there's sections where some waves are bigger, and some \"cancel out\" for a second. This is interference, where its not a clean simple wave.\n\nRemember how the energy packets *must* be specific values, and are not continuous? Well, this is where it comes into play. Everything in nature prefers to be at as low of an energy state as possible. Each of these orbitals actually differ in energy, and this is the same for the bonding/anti-bonding orbitals.\n\nSo as you add electrons to an atom, they will start at the lowest-energy orbital, and then fill in each orbital at increasing energies. Each orbital \"type\" (without getting too complicated, these types are defined by energy level) has both a bonding and anti-bonding orbital associated with it. Anti-bonding orbitals are a higher energy than bonding (so they are less preferred by electrons), but the anti-bonding is *typically* lower energy than the bonding orbital of the next \"tier/type\" up. Remember when I said they hate being near each other if every number that describes them is the same? Well, one will jump up to a higher energy level rather than be near an electron of the same kind, even if it is a lower energy.\n\nThis is all to say, as you add electrons to a system, they will fill in starting at the lowest energy state, and up the ladder until you are done adding electrons. This is typically a mixture of bonding and anti-bonding electrons. \n\nIf you have more bonded pairs than anti-bonded, then you will form a bond overall between the two atoms!\n\nWhy does this work? Well, basically, \"bonding orbitals\" have electrons in between the two positive nuclei. \"Anti-bonding orbitals\" have electrons on opposite ends. Essentially, the positive nuclei would prefer electrons in the middle, and if their respective individual orbitals interfere to allow that, they will pull each other closer, creating a bond. The anti-bonding orbitals will tend to pull the two nuclei away from each other. If you have more bonding orbitals than anti-bonding, then the overall net pull will be stronger, and ultimately form a bond between the two atoms.\n\n/u/corrado33 Let me know if I missed anything here, since I actually just learned MO theory literally this week lol.",

When you push the electrons on two pieces of paper(atoms) together, if those electrons are in the 'sticky bits' part, they will bond.

This leads to a continuum band of states spread in energy; the large number of possible combinations of the wavefunction phases would all have slightly different energy values. \n\nFor example, the lowest energy state would be all the atoms being in phase. Imagine changing only one atom (of say 1000 atom \u201elattice\u201c). This is only a small change to the system as most atoms stay in phase and so this state is only slightly higher in energy.\n\nIn contrast a small molecule has discrete states separated larger in energy because making one atom of a small molecule out of phase is a large change to the system as a whole.",

A molecule like H2 (called \u201cmolecular hydrogen\u201d) is two hydrogen atoms bonded together. If you do the procedure to analyze the molecular orbitals, you will find that the two nuclei sharing their electrons is preferred to just hanging out on their own. Gold is actually a lot more different, because it is a \u201ctransition metal\u201d. Electrons in transition metals tend to be shared across lattices rather than form bonds, which makes them good electrical conductors. Without getting too in the weeds, there are a few types of orbitals that have increasing energy states: s, p, d, and f, *in general*, increasing in energy in that order, and then increasing in energy with each new \u201clevel\u201d: 1s -&gt; 2s -&gt; 2p -&gt; 3s, etc. Gold\u2019s electron configuration is 5d^(10)6s^(1). It turns out that that \u201cs\u201d orbital is actually more stable than the \u201clower\u201d d orbital, and so the 10 electrons in the d orbital are easy to share across the lattice of gold, but the 6s remains intact, so the gold doesn\u2019t react with the other gold atoms around it; just because it is sharing, it is *not* bonding with the other gold atoms. \n\nYou can think of transition metals like packaged ramen in water. Packaged ramen comes in a pre-formed block of noodles that you then add water and flavoring to make a broth. If you just keep the block intact, that\u2019s a lot like a lattice of transition metals, with the water being your 5d orbitals, and the flavor particles being your electrons in the 5d orbitals. Your lattice will be comfortable just chilling as it is, but you can break it apart if you want. The electrons will move freely wherever in the sea of 5d orbital, without the central atom doing much in response. This is what makes transition metals good electrical conductors.",

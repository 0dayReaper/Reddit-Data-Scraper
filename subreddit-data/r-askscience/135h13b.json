    "postText": "So I was looking at the nucelotide chart and noticed this, lead is the last stable element, seemingly due to being a double magic number element, but right after it stability drops into a ravine then comes back up. Also this part of the nucleotide chart gets \"flooded\" with alpha decay, everything in this region wants to alpha decay unlike the rest of the chart. Why is all this?\n\nI'm assuming it has something to do with \"magic numbers\" but that answer is pretty unsatisfying, there has to be a better reason or some elaboration on that, it also seems relatively close to very stable lead so thats surprising.",

            "comment": "Alpha particles are helium-4 nuclei, they contain 2 protons and 2 neutrons and are very stable. If a nucleus has a good ratio of neutrons to protons but it is \"too heavy\", then alpha emission is usually the most likely route towards stability. By contrast, if your nucleus has a \"reasonable\" mass, but its ratio of neutrons to protons is \"off\", beta decay (and sometimes electron capture) converts between neutrons and protons and brings you to a stable nucleus.",

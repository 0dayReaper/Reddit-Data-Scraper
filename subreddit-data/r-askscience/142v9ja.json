            "comment": "The answer is\u2026yes?\n\nYou can test for IgM (or IgG or IgA) levels in a patient without regard to specificity, though this is usually done for purposes of diagnosing immune system irregularities (e. g. Multiple myeloma, immune deficiencies, etc.)\n\nBut for many major diseases of public health concern, you can also test for IgM specific antibodies. That\u2019s kind of the bread and butter if the whole field of serology. There are IgM-specific tests for the viral hepatitises, measles, rabies, and yes, even malaria and dengue. Many are qualitative while some, specifically hep A and hep B, rely on quantitative interpretations to distinguish vaccination from current or previous infections.",

            "comment": "IgM testing can be specific for a certain pathogen, such as malaria or dengue fever, if the test is designed to detect IgM antibodies that bind to a specific antigen from that pathogen. \n\nHowever, IgM testing can also be nonspecific and measure the total level of IgM in the blood, which can be elevated due to various causes.\n\nAccording to a review by the FDA, IgM serology tests for COVID-19 have different levels of sensitivity and specificity, depending on the manufacturer and the validation method. \n\nSensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those who have antibodies, while specificity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those who do not have antibodies. \n\nA test with high sensitivity and specificity will have fewer false positive and false negative results. A test with low sensitivity and specificity will have more false positive and false negative results.\n\nFor example, one study compared four different IgM serology tests for dengue fever and found that their sensitivities ranged from 82.8% to 88.6% and their specificities ranged from 86.6% to 99.6%. \n\nThis means that some tests were more likely to miss cases of dengue fever (low sensitivity) or falsely diagnose cases of dengue fever (low specificity) than others.\n\nAnother source states that IgM serology tests for COVID-19 tend to have lower specificity than IgG or total antibody tests, which means they are more likely to produce false positive results. This could be due to cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses or other infections that trigger IgM production.\n\nTldr: IgM testing can be specific or nonspecific for a certain pathogen, depending on the design of the test and the antigen used. IgM testing can have variable sensitivity and specificity, which affect the accuracy and reliability of the test results. IgM testing is usually used to indicate a recent or current infection, but it can also be influenced by other factors that increase IgM levels in the blood.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-84173-1\n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/eua-authorized-serology-test-performance\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10618071/\n\nhttps://www.idsociety.org/practice-guideline/covid-19-guideline-serology/",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been trying to understand why the sky changes colors, and I think I understand most of it, but something in the online explanations doesn\u2019t make it clear for me:\n\nI\u2019ve read:\n\n- sky is blue because blue light gets scattered the most during the day. \n\n- in the evening it turns red because now even more of the blue light gets scattered\n\nSo a few questions:\n\n1. The scattering of light during the day: does it mean that blue light gets reflected off air particles and reaches our eyes, while the rest of the frequencies pass through and reach the ground?\n\n2. Surely some of the other frequencies also get scattered during the day, just in much smaller amounts?\n\n3. So during the evening blue light gets scattered even more, to the point where even less of it reaches the eyes?\n\n4. And so it gets red because now we can see the lower frequencies being scattered without blue overshadowing them?\n\n5. Trying to word it myself: during the day only the highest frequencies get filtered, but during the evening also lower frequencies get filtered, because now the \u201clight strainer\u201d (air) is just catching more of it?\n\n6. It gets darker in the evening without a good ability to see colors because there\u2019s is no blue and so on light to reflect off of objects?\n\n7. Is it ok to speak about light as a frequency? Or it\u2019s only correct to say \u201cwave length\u201d?",

            "comment": "Yes, I believe you're mostly right. This is all described via [Rayleigh scattering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering), which states that the amount of scattering light undergoes is inversely proportional to it's wavelength (actually, to its wavelength to the fourth power, so a very strong connection) (and to answer your last question, yes, you can talk about frequency or wavelength of light. They are bound together by the equation (frequency)\\*(wavelength) = (speed of light)). \n\nSo, coming from the sun is white light. The high frequency/small wavelength light (like blue) is more likely to get scattered. Thus, the blue light gets bounced all around, making the whole sky seem blue. \n\nSince most of the blue light gets scattered, what is remaining is the other colors. At sunrise/sunset, the light from the Sun is passing through more atmosphere, so the longer wavelength light (like red) has more time to scatter",

When the moon is completely in Earth's shadow, the only light getting to it has been ~~refracted~~ defracted around the Earth by its atmosphere. But because the atmosphere scatters out the higher frequency bluish light, the moon is only illuminated by what's left; the lower frequency reddish light.",

If that gets even more scattered than blue light, shouldn't the violet light be dominating?

It\u2019s true that our retinas are more sensitive to blue than violet, but it\u2019s also worth asking how we\u2019re can see violet at all.  Since the Blue receptor is the highest wavelength of the three, when we see violet, how do we know it\u2019s violet and not just slightly dimmer blue.  The answer has to do with a super cool trick with our red receptors.  See, our red receptors do indeed spike the most when we see red light (the lowest frequency of visible light\u2026but they also have a small reaction when they see violet light.  That\u2019s how you know you\u2019re seeing violet!  Your blue receptor pings a lot and your red receptor pings a little bit.  That\u2019s how you know it\u2019s not just blue.  Now, what would you see if you looked at bright pale blue?  We\u2019ll, your blue receptor would put out a high signal because it\u2019s perceiving a lot of blue.  But, since it\u2019s \u201cbright pale blue\u201d, there\u2019s also considerable brightness in the red and green frequencies, so those receptors put out a somewhat high signal.  Not as high as the blue since the pale color still looks like a shade of blue.  So, when your blue receptors goes very high, your red and green receptors go pretty high and your rod receptors (which are just sensitive to light in general and tell your brain about the overall brightness), your brian says, \u201cthat\u2019s bright pale blue.\u201d  Now, what about the signals would be different if you were seeing bright pale violet?  Well, your blue receptors would be slightly lower and your red receptor would be slightly higher. Yes, it would be different, but not very much.  The point is that pale blue and pale violet and crazy hard to distinguish, and it\u2019s because of how your brain sees color.  Add this to the other points people made, and that\u2019s why we don\u2019t see violet in the sky.",

            "comment": "Most of these answers have described why the sky is blue, but we should really be asking why is the sky not purple?\n\nBecause the molecules in the atmosphere are diatomic and are very small compared to the time light takes to travel across them, we can understand light scattering with the dipole radiation approximation. The electric field will wiggle the tiny diatomic molecules in the sky and cause each molecule to act as a light source, hence light scattering. \n\nThe electric field from the sun is white light which contains all frequencies, but when we expand to the dipole term and find the expression for the power radiated from the dipole, it turns out to be proportional to frequency to the fourth power. This means higher frequencies are scattered with more power than lower frequencies. Violet is a color we can see, and it has a higher frequency than blue, so why is the sky not violet?\n\nThe answer is simply human eye perception. We have three types of color cells in our eye which have peak sensitivities at three different places in the visual spectrum. We have way more sensitivity in the blue, green, and red parts of the visual spectrum than we do in the violet.  Our eye doesn\u2019t perceive all light frequencies. Our eye adds up what each cell can see from the source, which therefore means we perceive only one color. It\u2019s like adding a bunch of primary colors together to get a unique-looking color - though it\u2019s really just a sum of other colors. \n\nSo it turns out that what our frequencies eye can perceive from the spectrum scattered from the sky adds up to the blue color that we perceive, though there is far more violet frequency.\n\nThis has already been covered in this thread already, but we are now in a place to understand why sunrise and sunset have more yellow and red colors than blue. We can get specific about the shape of the radiated power emitted from a dipole, but we can go with a less detailed explanation:\nEnergy must be conserved, and blue light is higher energy than red and yellow. Thus if higher energy blue light is being scattered at other locations on Earth (sunset for your location is not sunset for other locations), then only lower energy light is left to be scattered. \n\nSource: Studied a publication about this very topic for an electricity and magnetism course a few months ago. I\u2019ll post the link or title to it as an edit when I can find it. \n\nAlso, please feel free to correct any problems in my explanation of the physics. Phone typing didn\u2019t help! :)\n\nEdit: Grammar, and I believe this is the publication: \nSmith, G. S. (2005). Human color vision and the unsaturated blue color of the daytime sky.

That's why the sky is light blue, a combination of white (all the frequencies) and blue (a small range of frequencies).\n\n3. The evening is not a special time for light. It's just a special place for you relative to the sun. For light to reach you from above, it would have to be scattered at 90 degrees. There is still some light scattered at 90 degrees, but less, so the sky above looks dark blue in the evening.\n\n4. No. The horizon looks red because for light to reach you from that direction, it must _not_ be scattered. Blue light that was coming toward you but gets scattered becomes someone else's blue sky in a different time zone, or scatters upward and flies off into space.",

There is just not enough larger particulate between you and the higher atmosphere to scatter yellow, orange, or red. Those large particles are present in a layer directly above you, but not in a density that scatters. When you shift the sun to the horizon, you are looking at the sun through that same thin layer of particulate, but it extends to the horizon. So, the sheer number of larger particles at sunset observed \"on edge\" scatters light in the yellow to red. You can have yellow, orange, and red skies during forest fires even during the day. Or during volcanic eruptions that are close. Brilliant skies at sunset are a sign of lots of particulate being kicked up.",

Because the sun is intense, the scattering gives you lots of blueness in the sky.  But because the sun doesn't travel very far through the atmosphere, the sunlight still has a lot of blue left, so the sun at midday won't look red.\n* At sunset, on the other hand, it's like shining a light on the edge of the glass.  A small amount of light travels through hundreds of kilometers of air.  That's enough distance for lots of the blue to be scattered out of the light, so the sun looks red.  It also means that opposite the sun, the sky darkens, because there's not much blue light left to be scattered back to your eyes.\n* Note that when you see orange or red skies close to the sun at sunset, this has to do with clouds, thin mist or other particles that reflect/refract the sunlight - a different process to the blue-light scattering.",

The intensity of the scattering is inversely proportional to the wavelength fourth power, which is why you will see blue light when the sun is closer to you (i.e. during the day). The light scattering in the sky is a phenomenon known as **Rayleigh scattering**\n\n2. Yes, bc of the fourth power law as explained above\n\n3. This is partially correct. As the sun is further away, the light that is able to reach our eyes is generally a red-orange color in part also bc of the polarization pattern of the sun, which changes throughout the day and year\n\n4. That is generally true\n\n5. It would be wrong to say that scattering is a \u201cfilter.\u201d Filtering in science indicates absorption, &amp; absorption is a different phenomenon from scattering. In fact, *both* contribute to the colors in the sky, &amp; there is a parameter called \u201cextinction coefficient\u201d that encompasses both\n\n6. No, it gets harder to see in the evening bc there is no **light** in general. White light shined onto an object will give the object colors within the band of white light only (unless the object is fluorescent)\n\n7. Yes it absolutely is. Light is expressed in either wavelength or frequency units. c = wavelength * frequency",

And furthermore, it is dependent on how big the molecules are wrt the wavelength of the light. Blue sky is due to Rayleigh scattering but for clouds, you\u2019re seeing Mie scattering. The light intensity is independent of wavelength hence its general white color\n\nRainbows are a phenomenon from refraction of water droplets typically. Refraction is also scattering fundamentally so they are linked but the way it works here they are distinct \n\nBut I do get what you mean tho, as I follow art enthusiastically myself!

The long wavelengths pass easier straight through.\n\nWhen you see blue sky, that is where the straight path down didn't make it. That straight path looks yellower or oranger or redder because of the missing light.\n\nYour sunsets have more air to pass through because of the low angle. All that missing blue of the red light coming straight to you was sent at a different angle to become someone else's blue twilight.",

            "comment": "basically you are mostly right. The scattering of blue or red and what you see depends on the path of light thru atmosphere. When the sun is vertical, it travels a minimum distance as opposed to when its at the horizon, which is the factor that largely causes most of the blue to be so diffuse we cant perceive it well.  \n\n\nalso not sure if filtered is the right word for it, its just that one source is much stronger than the others that it overpowers them and you only perceive the other color.  \n\n\nalso wavelength and frequency are both fine. It just depends on which research field you are working with which makes certain calculations easier.",

It gets darker in the evening without a good ability to see colors because there\u2019s is no blue and so on light to reflect off of objects?\n\nThe other answers seem to be doing a good job with the other points, but I thought I should chime in on (at least a portion of) this one:\n\nOur difficulty differentiating between colors in low-light conditions is primarily due to the distribution and placement of the light-sensing cells in our retinas and how they function. Cone cells are sensitive to differences in wavelengths of incoming light and communicate that information to the brain to be interpreted as color, while rods are most sensitive to differences in luminance. People are \"colorblind\" when they have fewer cone cells sensitive to ranges of wavelengths relative to people with normal color vision.\n\nAnyway, in low-light conditions, light isn't directly focused on our cone cells, and they don't take in enough light energy to produce a suitable amount of the chemical used for communicating color information to the brain. I don't think it has to anything to do with Rayleigh scattering.",

            "comment": "If I understand what you're saying, you are mostly right.  The difference however, is where the scattered light comes from.  When the sun is overhead, all the light shines straight down through the 100 kilometer or so atmosphere, scattering according to the statistics involved.  Shorter wavelengths scatter more than longer.  This part is not where the color comes from.  When that light scatters it still reaches the ground.  Now turn the earth so the sun is closer to the horizon.  There is a lot, and I mean a lot a lot, more atmosphere that it needs to go through to get to you.  As such the shorter wavelengths are being scattered out of that light and can't make it to you as efficiently.  As such, while longer wavelengths are scattered some, mostly they get through compared to shorter wavelengths.\n\nNow ask yourself: where did the short wavelength light go that was scattered?  It can't disappear conservation laws and stuff.  It's not being absorbed in significant quantities.  So where is it going?.  The answer is to the surface.  Where the sun is overhead.  The blue light you see in the sky is the light missing from sunsets and sunrises.",

Once they hit the atmosphere they bend. \n\nBut different wavelengths bend at different angles.\n\nSo blue light, UV, and higher energy beams bend at a small angle. This is why the sky is blue during the day and UV is the worst when the sun is overhead.\n\nRed bends the most, so that's where sunsets come in. It bends so much actually that the sun is \"over the horizon\" long before you see the sun go dark. It wraps around the globe.\n\nThe reason we \"see\" this color across the sky is where scattering comes. Slight differences in density of air, water, and dust cause the light which spans the sky to hit our eyes. Otherwise the sky would always be black like in space.",

He describes the polarization of light, Rayleigh scattering, and connections between the appearance of the sky and Avogadro's number. He discusses changing representations of the sky in art, from new styles of painting to new pigments that created new colors for paint. He considers what the sky's nighttime brightness might tell us about the size and density of the universe. And Pesic asks another, daring, question: Can we put the sky in a bottle? Can we recreate and understand its blueness here on earth? This puzzle, he says, opens larger perspectives; questions of the color and brightness of the sky touch on secrets of matter and light, the scope of the universe in space and time, the destiny of the earth, and deep human feelings.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttp://peterpesic.com/sky-in-a-bottle",

For example, a mist of water (the clear water is a different medium than the air. the colors spread out because each color is a different wavelength. But so i don't get confusing, all you really need to understand is: when white light changes mediums, it \"spreads out\" to make a rainbow.\n\nThe earth atmosphere is a different medium than the vacuum of space. So light from the sun hits the atmosphere and spreads out into a \"giant rainbow\". Such that, during the day we only see the blue part of the rainbow. During sunset and sunrise we can see other colors of that rainbow, particularly red orange yellow.",

Which one dominates the statistics of scatter depends on the size of the wavelength vs the size of the particle that the light is interacting with. \nWith clean air, the long wavelength light is still scattered, but tends to still scatter forwards. When you look at the sun you see more or less the output color spectrum of the sun. However since blue light wavelength is similar to the size of air particles, it gets scattered more randomly. The blue light you see in the sky away from the sun has not just been scattered once, it has bounced around thousands or millions of times. \n\nWhen the sun is setting, there is more atmosphere to scatter some of the longer wavelengths in a similar way as blue, that is why it looks redder. When there is pollution or other particles in the air that are very big, on the scale of the longer wavelengths, you\u2019ll start to see more and more red sky. There is truth to pollution making sunsets looks more beautiful. Of note, Smoke seems to scatter longer orange wavelengths well.",

During the day the incident sun rays only have to pass through a little atmosphere so only short wavelength light is appreciably scattered. At sunset the amount of atmosphere between you and the sun rays is much greater, so red has more time to be scattered",

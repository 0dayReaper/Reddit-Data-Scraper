    "postText": " I read Feynman's \"QED\", and I feel like I \"understand\" the quantum mechanics of a universe with only electrons and photons, to my own modest level of understanding. I want to understand the whole standard model to that same level. Is it the same, but with more particles?",

            "comment": "Maybe more accurate to say that the standard model is just QED with more fields. But basically, yeah. QCD for example, involves the strong nuclear force (gluons) and \"particles\" with \"color\" (eg. quarks). QED is electromagnetic force (photons) and \"particles\" with charge. Vanilla QED just considered electrons (and by extension, positrons).",

Other primates have protruding jaws that allow them to breathe while suckling. If we didn't have our noses we could be more prone to smothering. ",

If your nose was just two holes and you ended up pressing your face against something while you slept (such as a pillow, a leaf, or your mate or child), you might suffocate.  As it is, the shape of your nose keeps the area around your nostrils clear even when pressed against an object, helping you breath.",

Since they're suckling, when they make noise they're making the /m/ sound be default. It's theorized that this is why \"mom\" starts with an M in many languages. Baby starts to say /m/ around mom, a conditioned response, and mom starts to place meaning on it to mean her.\n",

            "comment": "The nose is actually an organ that performs many functions aside from just being a conduit to the respiratory and olfactory system.  The nose warms up and moistens  air before it enters the trachea in the winter and has an air conditioning effect in the summer.  The nose is the first line of defense before foreign particles can be inhaled into the respiratory tract \u2013 large particles are captured by hairs and smaller ones get caught in mucus.  In that way, it can be thought of as an organ of the immune system, since it is responsible for draining the sinuses.  The endings of the olfactory nerves go through the roof of the nasal cavity; if there was no protection and just open orifices on the front of the face, you would basically have very little between raw exposed cranial nerve endings and the outside world.  Lastly, the shape of the nose changes vocal resonance and affects your voice.\n\nEdit:  Wow, leaving for a few hours, you wouldn't expect a little comment about the nose to blow up like this, or else I would've elaborated more.  I did a little lower down, going into more detail on theories of racial/climate-related differences in nose shape and comparative anatomy of other animal noses (carotid rete).  I also agree that noses are not usually classified as immune system organs, but I just meant that it has functions with innate immunity.  And good point on helping to keep liquids out of the respiratory tract!",

We can't close our nose like we can our mouth, but the shape of the nose, the position and size of the nostrils, and nostril hairs themselves (which are hydrophobic), all serve to block water from entering the nasal passages.",

But then we'd hit problems with our eyes and ears - the further away they are from the brain, the longer it takes for signals to reach it for processing, and for major senses like those that delay could be deadly. We can't move them closer to the chest cavity without a loss of functionality; and we'd still need the head, for the jaws.\n\nI don't know. I agree the human body is poorly designed overall, but a lot of the compromises make sense.",

I'd just like to add that the design leads to parabolic airflow so air is simultaneously pass over the turbinates to filter and humidify the air before it hits the lower airway while also passing high into the nasal vault to hit the olfactory region for smell. Also having an external nose as we do allows us to have the \"nasal valves\" which is the narrowest part of the nose and allows us to sense the actual flow better, and the muscles of the external nose to some degree regulate airflow by dilating the nasal valves open when we exercise ( for example) or constrict it when we smell something unpleasant. \n\nIt also keeps rhinoplasty surgeons like yours truly in business.  :-) ",

Evolution occurs when random mutations help an organism or a species to survive better and reproduce. It need not be a step forward in all the characteristics of the animal, just the necessary ones that help it survive it's immediate surroundings. Also, a marginal step forward in one characteristic may itself provide a huge *net gain* in advantage for survivability and reproducibility, in spite of regression in certain other characteristics.",

However, we are even better at complex tasks like riding motorcycles and flying airplanes, but we clearly didnt evolve for those actions. The reason why it isnt talked about much is because support for the aquatic ape theory is largely based in fringe science/conspiracy groups.",

Gathering food in marshlands and coastal or riverine areas would have required standing upright, which would have encouraged bipedalism. Even present-day chimps/gorillas stand upright when they wade. In fact, water is really the only environment that forces primates to stand upright.\n\nHowever, the aquatic ape stigma extends to a stigma on considering wading as a cause of bipedalism. Which seems unfortunate, because none of the other explanations for bipedalism are particularly compelling.",

They all evolved much simpler morphological characteristics that didnt require the entire suite of changes bipedalism requires (brain functionality, new legs, new hips, baby birthing problems, etc).\n\nThe only bipedal organism around water is birds, and their bipedalism predates their own origin.

This is generally under appreciated in humans because we're not as good at scent tracking as dogs, but put your nose to the ground and you'll be impressed at how well you do. ",

The theory is that humans developed a nose bridge so that when diving into water, the bridge causes water to be diverted from entering the nostrils. I watched it in the 80's on HBO and always remembered the different monkeys featured, and that humans probably evolved from species with nose bridges and not apes.",

We evolved as social pack hunters on the hot African savannahs chasing down our prey over long distances. Because we also have flat faces, unlike most other animals, we need a way to prevent the aspiration of sweat into our lungs, which can cause serious health problems. That's why we have protruding noses with nostrils that face down. ",

It's an evolutionary cul-de-sac that explains why we have protruding downturned nosed.\n\n\"The species is known in local dialects of Lisu people as mey nwoah and Law Waw people as myuk na tok te, both of which mean \"monkey with an upturned face\".[4] Rain allegedly causes it to sneeze due to the short upturned nasal flesh around its nostrils. People from the area report that it sits with its head directed downwards, hiding its face between its knees when it rains\"",

That's why ancestors from hotter climates vs cooler climates have different shaped noses. ",

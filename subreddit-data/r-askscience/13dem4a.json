    "postText": "I understand that your body can adapt to harmful substances such as poison and become immune, for example, I know a story about a king of ancient times who took small sips of poison every so often to develop immunity, and one day he tried to take his life because they were going to overthrow him and he could not because the poison had no effect on him (lmao).\n\nso my question is why is it possible to become immune to some things like the poison of a rattlesnake, and not to others like for example mercury.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs it because venom is a biological composition of proteins and complex molecules and the body can learn to \"dismantle\" it and mercury is a simple metal?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nbut if that is why the body handles other metals as well, such as iron or zinc, calcium or gold in small quantities.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not trying to be a superhero, I'm just curious.",

            "comment": "Part of why this works is because the organic compounds in venom are macromolecules. They are large enough to have shapes specific to them and that do not exist anywhere in us so that we can identify them with antibodies but not suddenly develop autoimmune diseases. As organic molecules they are assembled using the same types of chemical bonds that most other biology uses, so we have the enzymes needed to break them down. \n\n  \nWith elements like the metals you listed, they aren't large and distinctive enough to be something our antibody system can work with. Or like zinc, and calcium, for example, they already exist in pretty substantial quantities in our bodies at all times and are absolutely essential for us to live. Many other trace elements are also vital for us to live. \n\n  \nWe also cannot break them down into something \"non-toxic,\" this is biochemistry not physics and we're not atom splitters, cool as that might be. So even if we had antibodies for certain metals they would just accumulate in our killer cells until those cells died and released all the metal again. Its better to just try to filter them out.\n\nYou might find this article on [innate and adaptive immune responses to snake bites](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8141633/) interesting.\n\nWe have two main types of immunity. The innate typically recognizes damage to your body, physical injury, inflammation, or the like, and triggers a series of different cell types to \"do something about this problem right now!\" without ever really identifying what the problem is. \n\nThe article has different sections describing how the cells in your outer and inner skin layers, as well as your mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and mast cells, are triggered into action by venom. That constitutes a lot of the main players in innate immune responses.\n\nThe adaptive immunity is the one in which your body makes antibodies which can provide you lifelong immunity to specific targets. Its typically what is needed to fight off viral and bacterial infections, and it can also be called into action by the presence of complex mixes of biologic foreign agents like those in venom. These are your T and B cells.",

            "comment": "Developing immunity requires long period of exposure. Thats how it takes millions of years to adapt and change body structure as per the stress it was exposed to.\n\nLethal chemical can instanlt start damaging. Body first has to perform damage control rather than perfotming experimemts on how to adapt to that.\n\nMercury gets easily absorbed and start damaging /killing cells\n\nSame is for cynide. as soon as we take cynide it starts killing rbc. Even 1miceogram has millions of cynide molecules and this millions of rbc are detroyed imefiatel if not treated imediatemy it will cause death.\n\nAnd if we treat it immefiately body doesnt have time to adapt to it and thus body will never get hold of it.\n\n\n**Concept of immunity mainly goes for biologival living samples whose imprints are taken by t and b cells and antibodies are made**\n\n\n**More evolved a organism is slower is their adaptibility. Virus can develop resistance to drug and alter their strain even if they exposed for small time because they having most basic cellular machinary capable of adapting and evolvimg faster. But human are the most evolved species they have 100s of kind of different cells.**\n\nFor yout question:\n**If one cells alters itself to become resistant to mercury then that altered structures will hinders all other cells functioning and whole body homeostatsis mechanism will stop and causing irreperable damage. And it takes 1000s of years for all those cells to adapt to one cell change** **It would take only few second for cynide or serine like substance to kill. While it taked 1000s of years to adapt. If person dies developing immunity is out of scoe**",

Often toxins accumulate due to harmful enzymatic reactions creating dangerous products. If you had a slightly different protein which changes the mix of products, you could tolerate more. \n\nAlternatively the immune system may recognize and breakdown products.\n\u200b\n\n&gt;\tIs it because venom is a biological composition of proteins and complex molecules and the body can learn to \u201cdismantle\u201d it and mercury is a simple metal?\n\n\u200bas above, its all about how the body deals with it. \n\n&gt;\tbut if that is why the body handles other metals as well, such as iron or zinc, calcium or gold in small quantities.\n\nAgain, the body has different mechanism\u2019s and the biochemical properties and reactivity will change how the body deals with it.",

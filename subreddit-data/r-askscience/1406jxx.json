    "postText": "I've been reading recently that sound absorption in the ocean has been decreasing with ocean acidification, due to a lack of borate ions. I understand that it has something to do with a reaction between borate ions and boric acid which absorbs sound in the process but I don't really understand the mechanics. I'm very curious, could anyone help me?",

            "comment": "The answer is related to the chemical reactions that occur when carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater and lowers its pH. \n\nOne of the effects of ocean acidification is that it reduces the concentration of borate ions [B(OH)4-] in seawater, which are responsible for absorbing low-frequency sound waves. \n\nWhen sound waves pass through water, they exert pressure that \"squeezes\" borate ions into boric acid [B(OH)3], a more compact molecule. \n\nIn the process, the molecules absorb energy from the sound waves and reduce their intensity. This is why borate ions and boric acid lower sound absorption in the ocean. \n\nHowever, as the ocean becomes more acidic, there are fewer borate ions available to react with sound waves, and more boric acid molecules that do not absorb sound as efficiently. \n\nThis means that low-frequency sound waves can travel farther in the ocean than before.",

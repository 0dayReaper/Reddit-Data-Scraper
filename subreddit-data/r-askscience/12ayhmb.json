            "comment": "Female mallards have evolved a vagina specifically to combat the aggressive mating style of the males. It has many twists and turns and they can manipulate it to make the efforts of the ducks she rejects fruitless. Male duck penises evolve into long and twisted corkscrew shapes to combat this. A sexual arms race, basically. One that the females seem to be \"winning\" at this point in time.",

The more dramatic &amp; famous version of mallard \"mating behavior\" that many people have heard of is the exception, not the rule. Specifically, it only applies after most have paired up &amp; laid eggs, and only among those individuals that are not already paired.",

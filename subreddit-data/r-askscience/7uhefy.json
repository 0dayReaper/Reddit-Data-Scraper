    "postText": "A recent post to /r/worldnews is talking about a cancer \"vaccine\" talked about in this [article](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2018/01/cancer-vaccine-eliminates-tumors-in-mice.html). \n\nAll sorts of claims have been made about cancer in the post. So, how realistic is this? ",

            "comment": "So, immunotherapy has long been seen as a holy grail for cancer treatment. The immune system is naturally programmed to attack cells that have gone a bit weird (to use the scientific term). The problem tends to be that the cancer cells can also alter themselves so that they are disguised from the immune system, or in fact inhibit any immune cells that come into contact with them. This stops the immune system from seeing them as dangerous, allowing the cancer to grow. So the balance of the immune response is in favour of leaving the cancer alone.\n\nWhat this treatment does is inject the tumour with molecules that tell the immune cells in the vicinity of the tumour to wake up and start doing their job, overcoming the inhibition that the cancer cells have put in place. This means that the balance of the immune response is now to attack the tumour, which seems to work very well.\n\nThe really cool thing is that now that the immune system is trained to see the tumour as bad, and will attack similar cells in different sites. This is why it behaves in some fashion like a vaccine.\n\nIt's perfectly viable, and very exciting. As always, there is always the question of how well it translates into human biology but it is still very promising. I think one problem is going to be how specific the immune response is. In the paper, they see the immune cells are trained to attack cells with protein markers unique to the tumour cells, which is a good sign. One concern might be that if you accidentally trigger the immune response to normal cell markers, it could cause your immune system to attack healthy cells which would obviously be a very bad consequence. Another would be how readily a tumour can evolve to overcome the immune system attack. If the immune system only ends up going for certain markers, it could miss tumour cells that don't have the same ones. These could then continue to grow and cause the cancer to return.\n\nETA: thank you kind, golden stranger!\n\n...strangers!",

One of the two parts of this 'vaccine' is an antibody that targets ox40. Monoclonal antibodies being cheap and common enough to inject in vivo is something that has seen a lot of change and development over the past 20 years, so even the idea that you would have enough antibody to make a legit treatment is something that came about within the past 20 years or so.\n\n2. Combinatorial treatments where the efficacy really depends on both things being added together is hard to plan for in immunology. There are so many cell types to think about, and so many signaling pathways and cytokines involved. It is difficult to rationally design experiments to explore the entire combinatorial 'drug space'.\n\n3. It hasn't been *that* long that we've had a good idea of how the immune system interacts with tumors. People have known that successful cancers must have some form of immune avoidance, but the presence of immune cells within and around tumors, and their expression profile, was all stuff we've really delved into in the past 20 years.\n\n4. This is maybe implicit in my other answers, but anti-ox40 and CpG are not even close to the only potentially immunostimulatory molecules that could have been injected, and I'm sure many labs have tried injecting different things into tumors, with varying success. The interesting thing here (which, again, someone might have tried before with some other combination of stuff and got a worse response), is they used a TLR9 agonist that mostly activates dendritic cells and macrophages along with anti-ox40, which mainly activates effector CD4 and CD8 T cells, and might deplete regulatory T cells. So they really hit multiple cell types spanning the adaptive and innate immune system, which is probably a big part of their success.",

If the goal is to uninhibit the effect of the cancer cells, you cant skip steps, so... how is the cancer exactly inhibiting the immune response? Is there a way to reverse this? Would the same agent work for all cancers, or would different ones be needed? \n\nTo address the: \"why are we just finding this now?\" aspect... Research is a slow process that the layman does not quite understand. If you want to run a study, you must find funding. Often times, you are applying for grants that take weeks or months to prepare your proposal, and then your pitch is competing against others. If you then manage to get the grant, you have to actually construct a way to carry out the research that meets all ethical and legal guideliines. \n\nIn this case, a major part of the research is not only developing the vaccine, but in understanding the underlying mechanisms of what the vaccine is meant to treat, which most likely is the culmination of years of research from various groups and individuals. For cancer research in general, the barrier of twenty years ago (discounting for some technological advancements) is simply that its twenty years. Knowledge is cumulative on any subject in fields of research, and its very rare to skip from A -&gt; B... instead, youll start at A, discover 12 different alphabets along the way, and find your way to B eventually. Its not a task that one person is often capable of accomplishing. It takes years for different minds to touch the same information and build upon previous work and insights.",

It is just getting lots of press now, but immunotherapy treatments are standard procedure for several kinds of cancers all ready. In general, it is taking a long time to work because it is super hard to convince the immune system to start attacking neighboring cells with cancer without also activating it to go nuts and kill everything. That is a crazy delicate balancing act. Another difficulty is that every cancer has different mutations, and therefore different cell markers. To make an immunotherapy treatment effective, it has to be targeted to the precise cancer that a person has. You can't just make an immunotherapy drug for breast cancer then use it for melanoma or prostate cancer. It won't work at all. Related to this, is that many cancers are actually several different kinds of cancer simultaneously. For example, in breast cancer (which is my specialty) an average patient's tumor might be composed of up to 5-6 DIFFERENT strains/mutations of cancer that could require different immuno targets. It's just super hard to do this stuff.",

They tried it, and it didn\u2019t work. In the last few years they\u2019ve found the brakes. The brakes are the blockades that your good cells use to keep the immune system from attacking them. Cancer cells have the blockades, so the immune system thinks they\u2019re supposed to be there. So now they\u2019re trying to turn off the brakes (there are more than 40 different types) to figure out which ones will let the immune system kill the cancer cells without turning on all your good cells and killing the person.

They failed at even the most basic of these, and then tried to cover up the disaster instead of helping the patients.  So that was a debacle of more than just a drug that didn\u2019t work.  ",

Many people are working on exactly this.\n\n&gt; I'm thinking of just deploying the necessary number of trained immune cell and if the markers were wrong,\n\nThe big issue there is that it's not easy to know how many cells are enough. If you have a very high affinity marker, you don't need as many cells and they'll do their job and die off. If you don't have a great marker then you'll have to deliver the therapy over and over again to clear the tumour. Not impossible to overcome though.\n\n&gt; or they could also come with an special marker that would make them easy to target in case they get out of control\n\nSuicide vectors. Completely achievable.\n\n&gt; I wonder if once inside the body they talk to the other white cells and transmit the information which would make this idea/question stupid\n\nThey almost certainly will. Every immune cell is programmed to release specific protein and chemical signals that up or downregulate other elements of the immune system. However we have a fairly (though pretty incomplete) understanding of these signals and could potentially work with them.\n\n\nEdit: I should also point out that depending on the cell type used there is an increased potential for the proliferation of memory cells that will theoretically never leave the body.\n",

This interacts with another protein called PD1 on the surface of T cells, which are the main immune \"foot soldiers\" responsible for killing cancer cells. The PD1/PD-L1 interaction basically tells T cells to cool their jets, inhibiting their activation and therefore killing of cancer cells. Disrupting these kinds of signaling pathways is the logic behind so-called \"checkpoint inhibitor\"  therapeutics-- [Pembrolizumab] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pembrolizumab) and [Atezolizumab]\n(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atezolizumab) are two clinically approved monoclonal antibodies which bind to either PD1 or PD-L1, inhibiting their signaling and removing T cells from cancer-mediated immunosuppression. \n\nThis is just one example of how cancer can modulate the immune system, and how we can tweak signaling pathways to modulate it back. There are a lot of other currently approved immunotherapies out there that utilize different mechanisms, and many many more in clinical trials, but the principle is pretty similar.",

This results in a T cell immune response by the host that can eliminate metastatic disease in animal models. Based on the results of our preclinical animal model, we hypothesize that by using an antibody against CTLA4, we can further enhance this therapeutic immune response.

They mutate randomly, gaining new antigens. However, some tumor cells ( say 3-5 ) mutate so that they express very little to none \"foreign\" antigens. This immune stimulation happens and tumor loses every cell which has an antigen. \n\nNow we have 3-5 cells which have been preserved. They can either grow ( if the oncogenic mutations have remained) or not grow ( if the oncogenic mutations have been randomly reversed).\n\nThis is a matter of statistics, and probably can lead to a tumor coming back in 10 years or so. But even with that - some cancer patients diagnosed today have less than a year to live, and to give them a couple of more years without the painful chemo is a huge plus.",

Because of this, costs are sky-high.\n\nA friend of mine works as a chemist for an immunotherapy startup - the full treatment regimen costs between 100k-500k, and that is with the caveat that they are still pre-approval from the FDA. Once they have approval it will probably add an extra 0.\n\nI will say that some immunotherapy startups have seen success rates ranging from 70-90%, with none of the deleterious side effects found in other cancer treatments.

For those who don't know, if you have leukemia (or certain other cancers), you can go through a \"transplant\" where your immune system is basically eradicate via chemo and a donor provides their stem cells which create a new immune system. \n\nUnfortunately, the new immune system from the donor can get a little too \"excited\" and start attacking some of the patient's healthy cells (usually skin, liver, lungs, and GI) known as GvHD. This is why for about a year the patient is on immunosuppressants to try to prevent this reaction from occurring until the donor immune system \"recognizes\" the new host as their own. There is a whole host of tests run before a transplant to try to find a donor that matches the patient as closely as possible to try to limit this reaction. \n\nAs a transplant survivor who is starting to have some GvHD (damn skin rash), this is first hand knowledge. Using immunotherapy (IMO) is going to take some tweaking to make sure healthy organs aren't attacked. BTW if you want to be a hero to someone, sign up to be part of the [National Bone Marrow Registry](https://bethematch.org/) - it's easy and you can save someone's life WITHOUT having to die. \n\n",

What's really cutting edge are the personalized cancer vaccines based on mRNA that are in clinical trails in humans **already**. Basically, these vaccines are tailored to an individual's cancer. You see, your cancer and my cancer may have the same name, lymphoma for example, but they may be very different in terms of their susceptibility to drugs and especially to vaccines. Using personal genomics to tailor mRNA to program your own cells to make a vaccine against your very unique form of cancer is the real key to all of this. Adding on top of this is that mRNA is just a superior way to produce vaccines. As it turns out, when your body makes the vaccine inside its own cells, it stimulates your immune system more effectively than a vaccine made in a factory and injected (this has to do with MHC1 and MHC2 activation). \n\nThese clinical trials are looking promising. If they work, this can be combined with checkpoint inhibitors and other mRNA therapies (that also boost immune response against cancer) and it's bye-bye cancer. \n\nLet's just say that it's the most promising thing I've seen in cancer therapy ever.

The level of toxicity that triggers this varies of course, partly due to the aggressiveness of the cancer. \n\nA recent metastatic lung trial closed due to a sudden death rate of 5% and another I think was held due to like a 15% rate of severe pneumonitis. Trials differ but they generally have a conservative (to me) cut off for pulling a drug if it has lethal side effects. Of course if the patients who didn't die showed marked response, then that's a different story. We still do procedures like allogenous bone marrow transplants which can have a 30% death rate in the first 3 months but we still do it because you basically have a 100% death rate in the next 6 months and if you do survive, you have a fair chance of being cured. \n\nAll those determinations are made by higher ups (and the FDA will hold a trial as well if it's showing bad results). Bottom line is you wouldn't bring a drug to market if it kills more people than it saves. ",

It's about like 5% of animal trials that are successful that ever see success in human trials. for the bigger animal trials with like incredibly good results its like 30%. And then it's still like a 5-10% chance of making it from early human trials (phase 1) to actual market (success in phase III).\n\nThis is why I tend to ignore all animal trials as someone who doesn't do any basic research and mainly treats patients. Such a low chance any of these trials will make it through and it will take at least a decade as well to get through all the trials (although there has been some progress in speeding that up). \n\nThe premise is definitely sound though. We are using immune targeted therapy right now for cancers with better results than most chemotherapy drugs. As OP said, there are current human trials for \"vaccines\" as well. Definitely a promising time. Should note that this isn't a 1 shot cure for all cancers. each cancer is incredibly different and hides from the immune system in different ways. Odds of finding 1 drug that can cure them all is virtually impossible at this point. It's still incremental progress like always. ",

The cancers that become problematic are those which have evolved to 'hide' from the immune system. The ways they do that for example are to alter the receptors on the cell surface that could trigger an immune response. Cancer cells that get removed by the immune system don't propagate, while those that can avoid it do multiply. Immunotherapies can help to trigger an immune response to those cells, but there is always potential for the cancer cells to evolve again to avoid the immune response.",

Duke has modified the polio virus to attack cancer cells, and they inject it into the center of a brain tumor. While the polio virus is attacking the cells, the immune system starts going in to clean up the mess.  In turn, the immune system learns to recognize the cancer cells.  The whole process seems to last for months after just the one single injection.\n\nYou can google PVS-RIPO for further information.  The first few patients were treated in 2012-2013 and some are still alive without any further treatment. Those patients had recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme, which is perhaps the deadliest cancer situation that one can imagine.\n\nWhile this would technically be considered virotherapy, the immune system plays a huge role in the outcome.\n\nThey are now in phase 2 trials, and still only for brain tumors, but I believe the assumption is that it could be widely used among many different solid tumors in the future.",

The main fear is something called \"tumor seeding\", which can also happen when they aspirate or biopsy, or do something otherwise invasive with a tumor that could cause cancer cells to dislodge and make it to the blood or lymphatic systems. If the tumor is well-demarcated (ie. enclosed), you don't want to open up a channel to your blood supply for cancer cells to spread throughout your body (hematogenous spread). Clinically the chance of this is probably very low and this is a consideration when physicians consider how to biopsy a tumor, but if you start making it standard procedure, who knows what could happen. \n\nEven if the cancer is metastatic, it is possible that it's in a compartment that is very well isolated from the rest of your body. For example when testicular cancer is suspected, a biopsy is almost never performed and the suspected testicle is straight up removed because it's in a very well-enclosed portion of the body (referring not to the skin scrotum, but another membrane separating it from the inside of your body).

When early studies of endostatin (an anti-angiogenesis molecule) performed very well, Time magazine printed a cover along the lines of \"A Cure for Cancer\".  \n\nIn retrospect, people in the field admit that it should have read \"A Cure for Cancer in Mice.\"\n\nThere are many issues with mouse models, not least of which is that cell lines are often the source of the \"tumours\" (such that they differ dramatically from tumours that arise spontaneously in humans.\n\nThis study accounted for that somewhat.  They did some of their experiments with cancer cell lines injected into mice, and some with mice that spontaneously develop tumours.  Even the latter have to be taken with caution, though, as these are still derived from modified cells that express a specific tumour-inducing viral protein.  (All the cells in these mice have the gene for this protein and they develop breast tumours.)\n\nFinally, immunotherapy has been an amazing step forward and, along with targeted therapies like monoclonal antibodies (which are used in immunotherapy) and small molecule kinase inhibitors, represents the biggest advance in the past 20 years.  \n\nSo the strategy is promising and it is aligned with what has been working over the past few years.  Too early to say how it will work in humans.\n\nHere's an [article](http://fortune.com/2004/03/22/cancer-medicines-drugs-health/) on some previous stumbles.",

            "comment": "Immune therapy isn't new. It works wonders in theory and for limited times has near-miraculous results in practice. Similar clinical trials have already been done, achieving similar results for a limited period of time. Problem is the mouse model in the paper is very simplistic -- a flaw for most (all?) tumor mouse models. Real stage IV nasty cancers that we have a hard time curing usually have genetic instability and *extreme population variance* that is somewhere between extremely difficult and impossible to simulate in a laboratory. Real advanced cancerous tumor cells tend to adapt to cancer \"vaccines\" and come roaring back in a few months, almost without fail. Because of that population variance. And the next time they are completely unresponsive to the vaccine. The population variance tends to overlap extensively with the variance of the normal body cells, which is why curing cancer *in general* seems to be nearly or actually impossible.\n\nCalling them \"vaccines\" I think is a bit of marketing. They are not vaccines, since they are not meant to prevent cancer, unlike the HPV vaccine for example. It's marketing to get people to trust it a bit more, I think. I would call them immunotherapy, just because that's really what it is. But, in my cynical opinion, the reason why immunotherapies are getting hyped so much is because there's TONS of money in it. It's not creative, risky work so much anymore. Corporations or investigators just follow a known and predictable process to generate these antibodies. Build an custom antibody, patent it, and sell it. And it's all patentable, every new target, every new cancer is a unique invention. And treatments can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for these cancer vaccines. That, in practice, yes, are almost certainly doomed to ultimately fail (won't cure the cancer). However, they are also very likely to reliably prolong survival, especially in cancers where there was nothing else you could do a few years ago to even budget survival a little bit. So, want to make a few billion dollars? Find a cancer for which no current practical therapies exist -- a nasty, lethal cancer that kills people all the time with few options -- make an immunotherapy to it. Show any kind of efficacy, and bam: Instant money. Is that the way we should be running medical research and making healthcare decisions? It doesn't matter, that's just how it's done. But, like I said, I'm probably cynical. \n\nSome people believe in this a lot and think it's the future. They know the problems but think if you just tweak it, it will work like gangbusters. That kind of tweaking is not what this article did, which would be a lot to ask. That's why it's buried in the middle of a pretty prestigious journal instead of the lead story for the most prestigious journals. Maybe the tweaks are possible someday and the therapy will work super consistent. Who knows, that's science. My personal and professional take is that the problems with immunotherapy are *probably* mostly intractable, that they've essentially already made almost all of the progress they are going to make, and that further advancements might help a few edge cases but will fall far short of a general cure for cancer.",

            "comment": "TL;DR. Immunotherapy uses monoclonal antibodies which serves to block inhibitory pathways tumour cells might utilize to halt the immune response. This works best on tumours with high mutation rates, \"hot\" tumours, essentially making them appear as foreign to our immune system and illicit a response. Other tumours have low mutation rates, \"cold\" tumours, which appear almost identical to our own cells and therefore wouldn't traditionally trigger the immune response. Using antibodies inhibits the inhibitory pathway, effectively activating the immune response. This therapy, although promising, is very toxic and expensive. Altogether, this is a very promising avenue in cancer treatments moving forward\n\n\nCancer vaccines, a.k.a immunotherapy, is a remarkably vast and exciting field of oncology. In general, immunotherapy serves to educate our immune cells, namely our B and T adaptive lymphocytes, to recognize and kill tumour cells. Tumour cells are smart and will develop mutations to prevent them from being recognized and consequently killed by our immune cells. Tumour cells have learned to up-regulate specific proteins, called checkpoint inhibitors. Checkpoint inhibitors are normally expressed on immune regulatory cells, which when bound to ligands on activated CD4 and CD8 cells, halt their activation and \"shut\" them down. Tumour cells expressing these checkpoint inhibitors, namely PD-1, can effectively inhibit the attack from CD8 cells that may recognize the tumour as foreign. Tumour cells also can secrete various cytokines in the microenvironment, such as TGF-B and IL-10, which can also inhibit the activation of CD4 and CD8 cells, as well as boosting the activity of regulatory T cells which can exert similar effects.\n\nImmunotherapy works by using humanized monoclonal antibodies that when bound to checkpoint inhibitor proteins prevent their binding to its complementary ligand. This means you are inhibiting the inhibitory pathway, which ultimately leads to an activation of CD4 and CD8 T cells that recognize the tumour as foreign. Now, that is the major caveat of immunotherapy. The CD4 and CD8 T cells MUST recognize the cancer as foreign. \"Hot\" tumours are tumours with high mutation rates and therefore generate neo-antigens quite frequently. A model \"hot\" tumour is melanoma, whose high mutation rates are as a result of constant exposure to harmful UV radiation from the sun directly. Tumours that generate new antigens frequently increase the likelihood our CD4 and CD8 cells will have receptors that recognize this as foreign. \"Cold\" tumours on the other hand have low somatic mutation rates and do not generate neo-antigens as frequent as their \"hot\" counterparts. Therefore, our CD4 and CD8 cells are much less likely to recognize the tumour cells as foreign and the tumour persists. Keep in mind, tumours cells are just really messed up versions of our own cells. We have mechanisms to prevent our immune cells from attacking our own cells (autoimmunity). Cancer cells with low mutation rates look identical to our own cells, which would not typically illicit an immune response.\n\nAnother avenue recently taken is the use of oncolytic viruses as part coupled with monoclonal antibody therapy. Oncolytic viruses prefer to infect tumour cells as tumour cells represent the perfect host; they do not undergo programmed cell death, they do not alert the immune system and most importantly, are always dividing and replicating their DNA which the virus needs to survive. Oncolytic viruses, even with broad tropisms, will preferably infect cancer cells over normal healthy cells. When the virus completes a round of replication, it will lyse the cancer cells, releasing internal antigens that can stimulate the adaptive immune response, as well as danger molecules such as ATP. Danger molecules like ATP are powerful inducers of the immune response and can very quickly establish local inflammation in the tumour microenvironment, which is necessary to allow trafficking of the appropriate immune cells. Danger molecules essentially are the ticket for the immune cells to get into the tumour site. Monoclonal antibodies can remove any checkpoint inhibition the activated lymphocytes may encounter to kill the tumour cells. This has been shown to work extremely well, and even better, offers excellent chances for long term remission (memory effect of the immune system).\n\nUnfortunately, monoclonal antibody therapies act non-specifically and therefore can be incredibly toxic. Almost anyone that is enlisted on monoclonal antibody regimens for immunotherapy experience some adverse side effects. Unfortunately many must pull off treatment altogether. Also, there is a major cost issue especially in countries with private health care. Ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the CTLA-4/B-7 interaction, costs around $700 000 annually. Unfortunately, most people just can not afford this treatment even though it works.\n\nIn my opinion, this is the poster child of current cancer treatments. It is one of the only treatment regimens that attempts to \"personalize\" the treatment as much as possible and its ability to offer long term remission is extremely promising.",

Well, they're actually a couple different real things.\n\nThe first is vaccines like Gardasil (human papillomavirus), where the vaccine is **actually against a virus that causes cancer**. These are pretty normal vaccines. \n\nHowever, there is also a concept of cancer vaccines against \"neo-antigens.\" As cancer cells accumulate mutations, they begin to display mutant proteins on their cell surface. If we can identify these proteins, and create a platform to command cells to create antibody responses against them, we can program the immune system to seek out cancer and destroy it. This idea has worked in a variety of different animal models of cancer, from a variety of different groups, in a variety of different ways, which convinces me that the underlying technology is valid, and it's a question of when, not if, we see clinical advancement. \n\nChimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy) is a closely related technology where the T-cell programming is done outside the body rather than with a vaccine. It's very promising and even has an FDA approval at this point (Gilead/Kite's ~~Keytruda~~ Yescarta). We're talking cancer *cures* for cancers that were previously universally near fatal. Side effects and especially runaway T-cell proliferation can still be a problem. \n\nWatch this space. Scientists are seriously starting to crack this nut wide open, between new immunotherapy regimes (targeting PD-L1 and/or CTLA-4), programmed CAR-T cell therapy, and cancer vaccines. We're starting to understand how traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs may work in conjuction with immuno-therapies, and we're starting to understand the interplay between these systems previously thought to be disconnected. We really are on the cusp of a real revolution, and I'm usually an intractable cynic about most cancer therapies. \n\nEdit: got a brand name wrong. It's Yescarta. Keytruda is a monoclonal antibody immunotherapy targeting PD-L1. Five years out, it's 8x more patients are alive and cancer free (40%) than the previous treatment (5%). ",

    "postText": "From what I understand about the human and animal digestion, it is  desirable to extract as much liquid as possible from our food before  defecation. I assume that it must have been an evolutionary necessity to  be able to prevent any loss of liquid because water or food rich in  water would have been a precious good. Many herbivores such as goats,  rabbits, horses, and sheep have very dry feces. Why is cow dung then so wet, compared to these other animals?",

            "comment": "They aren't that wet. Atleast, cows that eat a lot of grass. Cows fed for milk production do have very liquid feces and maybe grain finish beef (i guess). Grass eating cows produce feces that should stack up in mound. They are wetter than goats but not really wet. I guess that the fiber ratio in their food impact feces formation. This is just observation from working on a dairy farm and grass-fed beef.",

            "comment": "it really depends on what animals eat and where they live. aphids for example try to get nutrients out of plant sap. for the amount of proteins they need, they need to filter alot of sap and don't even need all the sugars inside. That's why they produce these sugary drops, which then e.g. ants eat.\n\nMy guess is, that it is very similar with cows, that eat alot of fresh grass. By no means am I an expert on this particular topic though.",

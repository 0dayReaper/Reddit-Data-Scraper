            "comment": "Valuable is pretty subjective so it's hard to answer your question objectively. For example, using your New York scenario, in 250 million years, assuming there's some form of sentient life out there capable of making value judgements discovering what's on Earth, would they value an metal deposit more, or the potentially preserved remnants of a human city?\n\nIf I could re-frame the question into something like, \"What could be a large coal vein in the future?\" then I can try to answer that.\n\n~~A lot of the coal formations that we see today were formed during a period of time when tree lignin couldn't be broken down so it's debatable whether large coal deposits can even naturally form now.~~ Coal formations are being formed both now and in the future provided the correct conditions are met. Places where peat is in abundance which collects in swamps have the potential to turn into coal. Crude oil was likely formed by dead algae and zooplankton which during the process of decomposition, got covered up and then their remains were eventually put under so much pressure that they liquefied and drained downwards in the path of least resistance until they were trapped within porous rock formations. Assuming ocean life survives, in the future, former sea beds would be a likely candidate for an oil deposit.\n\nAs for cities, beyond their cultural or technological value, assuming they were preserved, from a raw resource-perspective, they could potentially become sources of highly-purified metal. The metal ores that we find today are unprocessed and have many impurities but the rebar and I-beams trapped inside concrete have been heavily refined and should be preserved. The copper wiring inside your walls, the galvanized steel inside power lines, there are lots potential metal sources that could be extracted from the site of a modern city. If the city was abandoned and covered up by stuff like leaves and regolith, it could even become a deposit of fossil fuels too as the biomatter covering the city decays and gets trapped within the crevices of the city structures.\n\nNew metal veins are constantly being pushed upwards due to tectonic activity but I don't know where they'll generate.\n\nLandfill mining is already a thing. Sometimes the landfills are mined for recyclable materials or scrap metal and other times biomatter like wood is sent off to be as fuel in coal plants. Landfills are also used today as a source of methane, which can be collected for power generation.",

Lignin decomposers were around during the Carboniferous, and the productivity of coal at this time reflects unique tectonic and climatic conditions. This is discussed more in one of our [FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/coal/). Suffice to say, coal has formed at other times and can still form.",

            "comment": "As a note for future oil deposits: continental margins where there is upwelling which engenders a lot of single celled marine life which lives and dies and settles to the bottom to become the eventual material for kerogen and then oil and gas to form is a good start.  You also need to have enough terrestrial sediment to bury the poor little dead guys but not too much to dilute them too much.  From there burial is key to increase pressure and more importantly temperature to generate the hydrocarbon which can then migrate into conventional traps or you can go to the source rock and do hydraulic stimulation to produce it.  For all of this the time scale is required is 10s if not 100s of million years during which the basin needs to remain structurally stable so that the rocks are not too disturbed.  Likely places I can think of are the northern coast of South America and the western coast of north, central and South America.",

    "postText": "It's fairly common knowledge that a lot of animals, including humans, share a common bone structure. Jointed limbs, often with smaller appendages at the ends of each. Spines, rib cages, etc. Mammals all share the structure with variations; horses, for example, traded tactile digits for stumpy legs, using the framework for claws to produce hooves, but retaining the same basic bones and joints. Even reptiles, amphibians, and birds share the same components.\n\nHow far back does one need to look to find a common ancestor that first developed this basic skeleton shape? Why was this the shape that stuck among most vertebrate creatures, and what prompted bones to develop among *boneless* life to begin with?",

There can be single-point edits that change one \"letter\" of the code, or larger edits that insert, remove, reverse, or move around some segment of genetic material. Those edits to genes can cause cells to make different proteins, or make them in different places, or under different conditions. And making proteins is how cells do most of the things that they do.\n\nWhen that happens in a random cell in your body that's copying DNA to replicate itself as you live/grow, it's usually no big deal - one cell line has a slight genetic difference, but we only really care if that happens to be one of the mutations that cause cancer.

In animals, heritable mutations occur in the tissues that produce gametes. There are mutations that occur in all cells, but obviously your potential offspring are not going to inherit mutations in a lineage of skin cells on your arm.\n\n&gt;\tWhat are the possible mutations, \n\nAnything that is generally stable given the physics and chemistry of environments on earth can be explored by the design space of evolution. Everything that differentiates you from a single-celled cyanobacterium is the result of these mutations. All of life results from this process.\n\n&gt;\tobviously we will never evolve the ability to shoot laser-beams, but I mean there do appear to be some material changes it can impart, at least enough that organisms speciate and lose the ability to reproduce with different species.\n\nThe limitation on this design space is called canalization. It\u2019s the opportunity cost forced onto you by the environmental pathway your lineage has taken in the past. In complex multicellular life it tends to be very restrictive, for example there is virtually zero variation in things like limb count or the presence of a spinal chord among vertebrates, because so much of our physiological architecture is based on these foundational pieces.\n\nEdit: the metaphor I often use in teaching is of a train which is eternally traveling forward. You can make alterations to the train only while it is running (ie your lineage is continuing): you cannot stop the train and make changes which interfere with the operation of the train, no matter how beneficial they might be once you get going again. So the requirement is that each step in the evolution of a multifaceted trait must survive the filter of selection as they are happening in real time. Stopping the train is extinction.",

If you\u2019ve ever repeatedly copied a copy of a document, you\u2019ve probably seen how this can degrade the quality of the copies over time.\n\nDespite all this, the body\u2019s systems for preventing genetic errors are extremely effective and so most cell division goes off without a hitch\u2026but an error rate of even .01% is still thousands of mutations.\n\nSo random mutations are actually pretty common.

Evolution works with those small, simple, low level steps - and it's too complex of a system to emerge in a single step.

The body usually notices these errors and fixes them, but sometimes one slips by.\n\nAnyway, imagine a fish with no bones and no teeth. Imagine that gene CGG means \"make skin\". But if it's misread as CCG. Close enough. The meaning of the gene becomes \"make stone\", causing the cell that developed the mutation to eventually fill with calcium and harden.\n\nIt happens randomly, a misreading here, a misreading there. Over the course of millions of years, fish are born with little hard spots in random spots of their body. They usually don't do anything, and don't give any advantage, so those genes don't survive. Until one day, a fish is born with a hard spot in it's mouth, and it helps it eat.\n\nThat fish gains an evolutionary advantage and goes on to reproduce, and centuries later, most fish have this gene that tells the body to make a little stone in the mouth. Randomly, fish also get misreadings to \"Make more\", most of which also randomly die out until a \"Make more\" misreading happens right next to the \"Make stone\" mutation from before.\n\nNow you have a fish with genes that say \"Make stone\" and \"Make more\", and somehow, that gives the fish a mouthful of embedded little stones. More random mutations and these eventually get a more regular shape, a more regular structure, and they start to happen in other areas of the body until we have a skeleton.\n\nAny mutation is theoretically possible, with enough iterations. We have electric eels, which can discharge electricity into the surroundings. We have neurons, which can conduct electricity along a path. Conceivably, you could eventually get to discharging electricity along a tubular bone-like structure. It's highly unlikely, and would require an incredible number of iterations, but it's possible.",

For example, a random mutation may have been the reason for the ancestors of Giraffes in a particular region to develop longer necks. Now, by sheer luck, these mutated individuals were not killed by an extinction event or natural disasters. So, over time, their mutation was passed down to other generations, and out of many other competing mutations, the one resulting in a long neck stuck.",

How does it's DNA contain the ability to mutate in such a way and not others?\n\nThis is a really good question. I think it might help to think of it this way: any mutation is *possible,* but almost all of them are either *invisible* or *unsurvivable.*\n\n1. Invisible - most organisms have a huge amount of DNA that is never expressed. Mutations to these parts of the DNA may never have any tangible effect on the organism since it\u2019s like swapping one piece of junk mail for another\u2026 doesn\u2019t matter since it won\u2019t be read either way.\n\n2. Invisible 2, electric boogaloo - the mutation produces a change in functional genes, but the change is so subtle it isn\u2019t noticeable or would only make a difference in some incredibly unusual circumstances. For example if a mutation only effect is making you less likely to develop skin cancer but your species lives in caves, it probably won\u2019t make any difference to your reproductive fitness.\n\n3. Unsurvivable - life has pretty tight margins of error. Most random mutations will result in something that\u2019s just not compatible with being alive. Changing a single base pair might make an essential protein stop working. Same goes with deletion and duplication.\n\nMost unsurvivable mutations are caught really early in development\u2026 the embryo will fail to properly develop *very* early (sometimes even before the blastocyst stage), or in the case of many animals the mother\u2019s system will actually destroy it if abnormalities are detected. This is one of the (many!) reasons why a large proportion of embryos fail to implant or are spontaneously aborted.\n\nSo the only mutations you end up seeing are the tiny subset that happen to change something that matters, while still producing an organism that can survive past the embryonic stage.",

They also serve as important reservoirs of calcium and phosphorus, both of which are essential for muscle and nerve function. When the body needs more of these materials osteoclasts will break down bone to provide them. Bones are definitely and important part of locomotion, but given how much marine life gets by just fine without mineralized bone, it seems likely the bone first developed as a kind of storage system for essential minerals",

And indeed if you look across all living species you'll find that they all share traits (e.g being cellular, using DNA &amp; RNA, having the same genetic code etc...) and these must have been present in the LUCA.\n\nHowever, when we say \"these things all share a common ancestor\" we're mostly not talking about the LUCA, if we're being more accurate you can think of the  phrase as being short for \"these organisms form a monophyletic clade who have a shared proximal ancestor\". That is, you can take every species in the group (\"clade\") and if you trace it back they all converge on a common recent (proximal) ancestor which is not the LUCA. For instance with all vertebrate species if you follow them back, they will all arrive at one joint vertebrate ancestor species that likely existed about 400million years ago. You reach this common ancestor before you go all the way back to the LUCA (approx 3.5billion years ago)",

Like, I'm sure there are conceivable and extant ecological niches that favour animals without bones, but no vertebrate has ever evolved to get rid of them to exploit such a niche, at least that I know of.\n\nSnakes have given up on having limbs, which I guess is as close as it gets, or maybe birds having hollow bones, but both haven't gone all the way.

Deeper sequencing might adjust the position of some organisms on the tree of life, buy there's really no way for modern sequencing to be so wrong that it fails to identify that something has a completely separate ancestry to all other living things.",

This applies far outside of just skeletons, into things like nervous systems, cone cells/eyes, and even down into how the proteins and other parts of flagella (\u201csperm tails\u201d) are very present in muscles. \n\nNature is lazy AF. \n\n[Illustrated brilliantly here as a surprisingly engaging Despacito parody](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ydqReeTV_vk). Snakes/lizard divergence is one example briefly highlighted.\n\nPS: not implying you didn\u2019t know all this and more, but for other interested laypeople.",

From there on the mammalia developed a secondary mandibular joint and now you make this animal larger and put it on two legs and you have a humans. That\u2019s the rough outline of the evolution of our skeleton. As to why, bones make good armour and can also store minerals, the question as to what happened first is not yet solved afaik.",

A distributed organ with one function armored itself up over many iterations to become a support structure for a body.  How that happened, how long it took, why that organ, all of this is known unknowns.  All we have here are theories.",

It was incapable of locomotion and is believed to have ingested food like modern sea sponges. \n\nThe basic structure of vertebra can be traced back to the emergence of chordates during the Cambrian period. Chordates posses a notochord which is a flexible rod of cartilage like tissue. In vertebrates the notochord helps with development of the neural tube along the entire vertebral column as well as a few other functions. Notochords are still found during development of most vertebrates today. Humans for instance still possess cells from their notochords until around age 4, while some species of fish possess them through adulthood. \n\nThe oldest known example of a proto notochord is Pikaia gracilens during the Cambrian period. \n\nThe rib cage can be traced back to early tetrapods transitioning from water to land. The rib cage developed to help with movement (picture the side to side gait of lizards) with the ribs twisting in sync with the vertebrae. From there it is thought to have helped with the transition of shifting breathing from muscles in the head to muscles in the torso. \n\nA subgroup of these tetrapods later emerged, the reptiliomorphs which were land based, reptile like amphibians. A group of these became the first basal amniotes when they began laying soft shelled eggs on land. \n\nAll reptiles, mammals and birds today are amniotes.",

These were jawless fishes from the Cambrian's 3rd Stage (which still lacks an official geochronological name) around 518 Ma (million years ago).\n\nThese fishes each possessed a characteristic internal notochord - a flexible rod that is essentially the precursor to a vertebral column. \n\nIf, at any stage in its life cycle, an animal possesses a notochord; it is, by definition, a chordate. I believe even tunicates (sea squirts), which are regarded invertebrates and are also first recorded around 518 Ma, possess, in their larval stage, a notochord.\n\nMy memory of things from here on in gets a little more hazy, so perhaps someone else can pick up, but as I understand it, the notochord continued evolving in fish into the nucleus pulposus which runs through the center of a conventional vertebral column and ultimately evolved into a conventional bony, disc-based spine as we know it today. \n\n(If I recall, elasmobranchs (sharks, rays, and chimaeras), having diverged so early on in fish evolution, never evolved bony skeletons and therefore remain primarily cartilaginous? I may be wrong here, though. Again, I'm sure other people here will know more on this.)",

Our ancestor was a lowly worm like creature called Pikaia -  not as well represented as other creatures-so not the top of the food chain, but that one\u2019s evolved offspring seemed to get through and survive all the past extinctions,  giving us two forward facing eyes, bilateral symetry (left to right mirror sides), and an ancient form of backbone (chordate). \n\nTurning the clock back, and starting over, its just luck that it made it, most likely another would have taken its place.  And star treks aliens would have five eyes, and a proboscis (nose)  to grasp things\u2026 \n\nIf you consider what the burgess shale tells us, you know that any description of aliens with left and right hands two eyes a mouth and nose are not from another alien evolution process- as any true alien will be evolved from something as unrecognizable as some of the dominate species are in the burgess shale from anything here on earth today.  Our shared cross species attributes are the result of a winning lottery ticket of a common ancestor, dating way back to ooze, and all sorts of horrible extinction events, odds say that the same outcome would never repeat itself again.",

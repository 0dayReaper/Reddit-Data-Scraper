    "postText": "Hello fellow science enthusiasts!\r  \n\r  \nI've recently been fascinated by the concept of time dilation, a fundamental part of Einstein's Theory of Relativity. It's a mind-bending idea that time moves slower as you approach the speed of light or experience stronger gravity.\r  \n\r  \nNow, we know that astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) are moving much faster than we are on Earth and experience a weaker gravitational pull. Over the course of their stay on the ISS, their clocks would tick slower relative to ours, but this effect is extremely tiny given the speeds and gravitational differences involved.\r  \n\r  \nMy question is: what tangible effects, if any, does this difference in the passage of time have on the astronauts' bodies and minds? Does it affect their biological clocks, circadian rhythms, or even the rate at which they age?\r  \n\r  \nAlso, on a psychological level, do astronauts report feeling any different in their perception of time? I've read reports of many astronauts experiencing what is known as the \"overview effect\", a cognitive shift in their understanding of life and reality when viewing the Earth from space. Could changes in the passage of time contribute to this phenomenon in any way?\r  \n\r  \nThank you for your insights in advance! I'm excited to dive deeper into this topic.",

What else could it be? Time dilation is only a thing if you compare your time to someone else. In principle you could see this in e.g. a call - but, as mentioned, the ISS is far too slow to make that noticeable.",

It's not because they did anything different, it's because you've got this 75% time factor between you and them.",

And by a \"little\" bit, it really is a little bit, about 0.007 seconds per 6 months on the space station. But yes, time dilation affects not just clocks, but also things like biological aging. \n\nHowever, the effect is so minuscule that it is unnoticeable by the astronauts.",

But you yourself would not notice any difference at all. It is only when you compare yourself to the rest of the universe that you can observe that something has changed, that you've gone through time differently; it is all relativistic.",

            "comment": "The first principle of relativity asserts that the laws of physics are identical in all inertial reference frames - this means that there\u2019s nothing special about the experience of time in the reference frame of an astronaut compared to someone on earth. In their frame their clocks tick normally and they observe our clocks to tick slower. Any discrepancies will be if people in two different reference frames observe the details of the same event and compare. \n\nFor example a person watching a race on the ground might see runner A beat runner B by 1 meter, while someone watching that race in a relativistic rocket might see runner A win by .5 meters. Everyone on the ground sees the same time as each other and likewise for the people on the rocket. You can\u2019t jump into a frame where B beats A, that would violate causality, but the specific space time coordinates of an event in 2 frames will generally be different. \n\nThe sense of perspective people get in space probably has more to do with the awe of seeing all of humanity on a bounded ball hanging in the void. They don\u2019t just know it as fact, they see that with their eyes and feel it in their bones, we can only imagine the psychological impact of that.",

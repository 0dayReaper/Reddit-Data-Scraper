I am not trying to come across as a skeptic, I just want to fully understand things.\n\nI have seen lots of reports and articles stating the frequency of wildfires we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years (in Australia, California, and Canada) is linked to climate change around the world. My question what exactly about climate change makes us more susceptible to wildfires?\n\nI live in the Eastern United States at the moment and we haven\u2019t seen rain in about a month, is the lack of precipitation making us more susceptible? Is lack of rain also an effect of climate change? If so how?",

            "comment": "Lack of rain is part of the issue, but as usual, it's a complex situation with multiple contributing factors.\n\nThe first one, at least the one I was aware of the earliest, was the spread of invasive species such as pine beetle, spruce beetle and a few others. When warmer climates allowed them to spread to new areas, they were able to outpace their natural predators and devastate large forested areas.\n\nThis was not necessarily a death sentence, but the most affected areas were areas where the forestry industry had razed biodiversity, and re-planted only specific kinds of trees (usually one species in a very large area). This unnatural configuration made them all compete for the same limited nutrients, weakening the top soil and making the trees unhealthy.\n\nUnhealthy trees are an easy target for tree-killing insects. Dead trees are basically kindling. A lack of moisture in the trees, combined with a lack of moisture in the environment, combined with the lack of other vegetation or healthy topsoil providing any sort of safety net, turns what was once a healthy, diverse forest into a Tinderbox.\n\nThe danger is amplified as temperatures continue to rise, because the trees get even drier, and the chance of a small spark setting off a massive blaze increases.\n\nI'm sure I've missed some significant factors, as wildfires were a thing before the invasive species showed up, but the increased frequency and severity is at least partially due to what I've outlined above.\n\nSomeone with more info will hopefully elaborate further and point out anything I've got wrong, here. :)\n\nEdit: u/link_hiker has raised an interesting study by NASA that found pine beetle kill and wildfire spread are not positively correlated in all cases.\n\nMore recent study seems to indicate the type of forest and regional factors can actually make pine beetle kill areas less likely to burn.\n\nHowever, other data suggests pine beetle kill areas, when they do ignite, burn much faster than healthy trees.\n\nScroll down for sources!",

                    "comment": "One point I would add is the link between your first two points. Invasive wood-boring insects generally target a specific species of tree, so as an invasive insect species enters an area and finds an entire watershed that was replanted by industry covered in a single species of tree (that the insect just so happens to find delicious), that invasive insect essentially just hit the jackpot and goes wild. Now you have a huge area of monoculture forest infected by an invasive insect and you get entire mountainsides of dead trees as a result, where if it was a healthy, diverse forest you would have some trees dying and other more resistant/untargeted tree species surviving and contributing to things like fire-suppression, slope stability, etc.",

I'm fine with correlation not being equal to causation, but saying that the tree resin on the pine needles is the main source of fuel seems to me to be only technically true, while also downplaying the obvious flammability of the rest of it. \n\nThey say in the video once the pine needles are gone, that fuel source is gone, but of course there's still dead wood to burn - you can burn a log with no pine needles on it, after all, and drier wood seems to burn easier than fresh wood...\n\nThey also said only in some samples the negative correlation was found, but that means it may have been positively correlated in other cases. We haven't consider regional or topographical factors, either. Overall I find this compelling but not definitive, and will have to research further.\n\nEdit: Further Research;\n\nSo the NASA video is from 2010, [This is a larger study from 2014.](https://fireecology.springeropen.com/articles/10.4996/fireecology.1002010) Here they did find a positive correlation between areas hit by pine beetle and wildfires. Not in the likelihood of a fire starting,  but in the rate of spread. From the abstract;\n\n&gt;Although the dataset is less robust than a strictly experimental approach, fires had faster spread and more crown fire than predicted, with a linear average of 2.7 times higher ROS in best fit models than expected for unaffected pine.\u00a0\n\nROS being rate of spread, and note they were specifically examining areas that had been affected by both beetles and fire.\n\n[NatGeo in 2020](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bark-beetles-helped-stoke-2020-devastating-wildfires) seems to have concluded it depends on the type of forest, with your positon being correct in significantly large cases. \n\nRevising my original position: So climate change increases the likelihood of a wildfire, but beetle kill only does so in some areas. Pine beetle kill does however increase the severity of a wildfire in most cases - the trees burn quicker, which means the fire can spread quicker, which means we have less time to contain them if we can't predict where they're going to go!\n\nThe more you know!",

I found the number you referenced, but also statistics showing 50% or more are caused by lightning (even today).\n\nI think the issue is that it's hard to qualify what counts as human negligence and what doesn't. If we raze a forest, and replace it with a timber-industry friendly one, then lightning causes it to burn down, we probably wouldn't consider that human caused, statistically. But would the fire have happened, or been as big, or spread as fast, if the original forest and its greater biodiversity were left intact? Evidence seems to suggest our actions are amplifying both the frequency and severity of forest fires, but not necessarily because we're starting more fires ourselves.\n\nBased on what I've read, the issue as it relates to climate change is that we're changing our environment to be more susceptible to wildfire, and less able to naturally contain the spread of a fire.",

            "comment": "This is a great question, because the answer is really illuminating.\n\nThe main thing to understand is that **the warmer air is, the more water it will hold**.  This has two primary effects: more hurricanes, and more wildfires and droughts.  Seems counterintuitive, but if you know the first thing (that warmer air holds more water), a picture begins to form.\n\nFirst the hurricanes.  Hurricanes are basically storms that happen at sea, and storms are powered by water in the air.  The water in the air is hurricane fuel.  The more water in the air, the more insane the hurricane.  As the global atmosphere has warmed, that's meant there's literally more water in the air with which to power hurricanes.  The result is hurricanes that happen more frequently, and when they happen, they're larger and last for longer.  More intense, and more damaging.\n\nOn the ground, the same thing is happening.  Warmer air means more moisture is literally getting sucked out of the plant life and carried away on the breeze.  So the plant life itself is dryer, dried out.  'Tinder' conditions.  This is also why the wildfires are so much more common in western North America, because those parts of the continent are climatically drier, they're deserts or near deserts.  Dry an entire forest out just a little and that forest is far more likely to catch fire, and that fire will spread more easily.  \n\nHope this helps!  Happy to answer any questions.",

These are fires that don't burn out, they go on smoldering underground, where they can survive through winter, and when it starts to get dry and warm again, whoomph, guess who's back!\n\nFor boreal forest these are a natural processes, and in most years represent a minor part of the forest fire issue, but they worry this is going to change. One bad year they caused 38% of the burnt area loss. Zombie fires also cause the fire season to be extended because they tend to blaze up early, often during spring, before the regular season. This causes more strain on fire fighting resources and staff. \n\n\nThe longer warm periods and excessively dry seasons are also drying out marshes and bogs too, making them even better places for a fire to overwinter. \n\nThe amount of zombie fires have increased and is expected to get worse. And as dry and disease riddled trees become kindling, zombie fires will more easily grow into serious problems. \n\nAnother factor climate change is affecting is increasing the likelihood of a common trigger for wildfires, which is lightning. More heat gives higher temperature on the ground which increases convection, and makes lightning more likely in some places. Especially in late summer, which climate change is also extending as a season. In Canada they are now seeing more fires triggered by lightning further north where it was once very rare. \n\nTo add insult to injury, big enough wildfires can cause the formation of pyrocumulonimbus clouds, a type of rainless thunderstorm cloud that can create even more lightning. They can cause quite nasty wind situations too that make it near impossible to control the fire on the ground. \nSo it's the curse that keeps on giving.\n\nAnd as the forests dry out they burn hotter, making such clouds more likely to form. And Canada is one of the top places where pyrocumulonimbus clouds are more frequent. \n\nIf you get both zombie fires and worse lightning conditions you can now end up with a fire season that starts in spring and doesn't end until mid autumn.",

They're roughly a 10-20 year event in most places (meaning 1 fire is likely in roughly that time period), and in drier parts of the country, or areas that have been built up recently, maybe a bit more than that.  That means in any given year 5-10 of the back country will probably burn.\n\nThis is an area where it's super easy to get a bad case of recency bias and assume we have \"all these wildfires\" when the truth of the matter is that it's maybe 1 more fire in any given year, perhaps less. Large fires are big events.  It does not take a very large increase in the number of overall fires to be statistically significant.\n\nIf we assume that AGCC (anthropogenic, IE manmade, global climate change) is having an impact, it's probably going to be seen in dry conditions creating larger fires.  but at the moment we don't have a great deal of evidence that we are in fact observing this happening.  And in fact AGCC can have the opposite effect in some areas with increased warmth leading to increased evaporation, increasing humidity levels and leading to longer rains and shorter dry periods.  It can even do both in different regions based on georgraphy, such as in the Sierra Nevada range which has a clear wet and dry side, you can literally end up with excessive flooding on one side of a mountain and a drought or wildfire on the other side of the same mountain.  Nature be crazy sometiems.\n\nSo while you're going to see a lot of interesting science fiction in this comment section, the truth of the matter is that we're still working on pinning down the exact effects of AGCC and the research on its broader global impact is either based on limited sample size, computer projections, or in the worst case scenario, a good old fashioned ass-pull.  The answer to your question is probably going to be only made abundantly clear sometime in the next 5-15 years when we have more data points and the trend is easier to read.\n\nInteresting to note -- the Pacific has a \\~20 year oceanic weather pattern called el Nino/La Nina.  During the La Nina period moisture is drawn away from the American pacific coast causing drought and extra fires.  During El Nino, it comes back with overwhelming force.  The last switchover to El Nino was around 2003 IIRC.  We're due for another one.  Next year could be very, very damp in all the places that are burning now.",

The lack of available bio material means life on the forest floor is affected, and the growth of large shrubs is less sustainable compared to dry grasses.  The forest floor is becoming a super highway for fire to spread to increasingly dead and drying trees.\n\nGlobal warming sets the stage for things to be extremely vulnerable.  The dryness of the area allows for more severe weather as well.  We're getting more severe lightning storms now because of the way that dry air is less insulating between the positive and negative charges of ions.  So when wet air goes up the mountainous west coast it is squeezed of its moisture but the cold temperature remains.  The cold air blasts over the other sides of the mountains creating a rain shadow, and the extreme temperature differences of the air result in massive positive / negative charge differences which creates crazy lightning that is landing in bone dry environmental conditions.\n\nThen, because these environmental conditions are so widespread there is nothing to stop forest fires from blazing out of control.  It used to be that forest fires wouldn't spread so far across regions because of the way that weather systems would create opposing winds, moist air would overpower progressing forest fires and their directions would change and they would burn over on themselves.  \n\nNow because everything is becoming dry dust, combustible, air filled kindling the difference between different biomes in Coastal / Interior mountain forests is less and less.  In general everything is dryer as a result of warmer winters.  Now when a forest fire starts it gets big fast, and injects so much hot smoke into the atmosphere that it creates its own weather system, often to the degree that it over powers the pressure systems in other regions and you get this awful smokey lightning storm that rages over massive distances.\n\nThe approach to combat this is to manage forests so that the high risk areas are culled in advance of fire season, which itself is starting earlier and going longer thanks to increasing global temperatures.  In Canada at least this was something that should have been started 30 years ago, as it will be more than a decade or two before we see any effect, and it's very costly.\n\nAdditionally, the devastated areas from wildfires now do not hold their shape and disastrous erosion in the form of mudslides occurs because there aren't healthy trees to hold the land in place.\n\nThese mudslides take out more trees, and perpetuate a problem where we don't have bio material to hold water, and things get worse and worse and worse.\n\nForest fires are making it so we get less rain, as the vital evaporation of water into the atmosphere occurs in forests.  We don't get near as much of that as we used to thanks to everything drying out, and the cycle continues.\n\nThe world is getting hotter, it's squeezing itself for moisture, becoming more vulnerable to burning, and then when it does burn it destroys natural infrastructure that contributes to the water/weather cycle and would otherwise keep the system in balance.  \n\nJust like in every other area global warming has skewed systems toward consuming more resources than they create, and the unsustainability is resulting in extreme environmental disasters that are now hastening the effects of global warming.",

The following part of your paragraph sort-of redeems yourself.  At least you are not a human caused climate change denier.  The global ecosystem is complex enough, one can get away with saying there is no one event, or source, that is causing this.  But to claim that NOTHING is DIRECTLY related to climate change is - to me - a gross misstatement.  Humans have been using fossil fuels, and have shifted the percentage of CO2 in the global atmosphere to the point, that we are causing mass extinctions and totally changing the global climate.

Climate change doesn't start fires: people or lightning do that.  Climate change doesn't make it hot and dry one particular summer so that a fire can spread: weather does that.  Climate change alters large scale wind and precipitation patterns, which makes it more or less likely that precipitation will fall in an area.  The result is to make unusual weather more likely, which indirectly makes fires more likely.\n\nYou can call what I am saying illogical and infuriating if you want, but everything I said matches the science.",

I think something can be said to be Directly Related to another event, even if there are multiple steps and variability involved.  You are stating that because there are multiple steps and variability involved, it is Indirect.  When our kids and grandkids all start dying, because the climate change has effectively eliminated our food sources, I bet no one will really care which of us was more correct.  I\u2019m sensitive to any way that people try and water down the severity of what we humans are doing to ourselves.  There is a good chance humans are going to disappear from history, because our society doesn\u2019t think it is cost-effective enough to make the changes now.  Governments love a 10, or 20, or 30 year plan to make changes.  I\u2019m emphatic about this, because I think we are already past the turning point.  Have it your way: Climate Change is indirectly on track to wipe-out most life currently existing on the surface of the Earth.  Not Directly - Indirectly !",

Often the way I find the science is by searching on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/schhp?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,5).\n\nFor example, if I search for scientific papers related to the Australian fires I find that science has [established a robust and multi-evidence link between climate change and increased fire activity over the past three decades. Both increased temperature and shifts in large-scale rainfall patterns have very likely played a dominant role in observed burned area trends.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-27225-4) And that [the climatic potential for large and severe forest fires has increased across south-eastern Australia since the 1950s, probably because of anthropogenic climate change. The magnitude and severity of the 2019\u20132020 \\[Black Summer\\] fires reflected climatic conditions that are driving an increase in the size and severity of wildfires.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.13514)\n\nThe science says that [eastern Australian rainfall is affected by the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/clim/27/10/jcli-d-13-00554.1.xml?tab_body=fulltext-display). The IOD can [reduce the rainfall over some regions of Australia](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003GL017926), and far beyond Australia it can [influence weather around the world](https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/cr/v25/n2/p151-169). And the IOD in turn is [being altered by climate change](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2009GL040163). \n\nA useful search term is \"attribution study\". For example the World Weather Attribution site tells us, [projected into the future, the models \\[of Australia\\] simulate that a Fire Weather Index at the 2019/20 level would be at least four times more likely with a 2 \u00baC temperature rise, compared with 1900.

            "comment": "It is almost impossible to quantify the role of humans when dealing with a process (climate variation) having multiple, numerable, contributing factors.  Multi-variate analysis and other statistical evaluations can provide a semi-quantitative indication of the importance of a single cause, or a set of causes, but precision is not happening.\n\nEven when you do such an evaluation and the study reveals that some factor, let's use rainfall as an example, has decreased by 30% over some specific time period in some specific region (how do you define that region though? where is its exact border?), you still have to figure out how much of that change was caused by man rather than just natural variability.  THEN you have to look at how fire development responds to such a lowering of precipitation (it isn't likely to be a first order or linear relationship). So, pretend that we could say that half of the rainfall decrease is caused by man, but we also find that fire frequency increases rapidly at some low-rainfall threshold (hardly any when slightly wetter yet fires are everywhere when slightly dryer).  How much of that 50% man contribution equals the jump in fire numbers?  Is it ALL or only half? Because without man input, the threshold would not have been crossed, but on the other hand, man alone also did not cause the threshold to be crossed. Yet the threshold was crossed when both contributions are combined.\n\nIt is pretty clear that climate is experiencing some fairly important variations and that humans are contributing to that, but there is no real way to put a decent number on proportional fault to how the world is responding to those variations.\n\nIt is sort of like asking how much of abnormal behavior in some adult is the result of having a parent that was drunk and abusive.\n\nWhat we can say is that the frequency of adverse results increases with exposure to abusive parent / human pollution, and we can even define a loose correlation between the one factor and the results, but the correlation is extraordinarily noisy.   Not a nice cloud of results almost making a line.  \n\nSo, all we can say is that you risk bad outcome if you allow that negative factor, and the frequency of bad outcome increases as you allow that negative factor to gain importance.  Lots of cases of exposure to a high risk though have no negative outcome, and lots of negative outcomes happen even when the negative factor is not important.\n\nDon't do the risky thing if you don't like the consequences that the risky thing makes more likely.  Insurance actuaries can make broad conclusions when provided with huge amounts of data, but the numbers are not solid even then.  I don't think it is reasonable to expect climate scientists to be able to give precise answers, and any number they give has to be viewed as nothing but a ballpark value.",

Hot dry high-pressure air over land resists the cool moist low-pressure air from the ocean.  Once the heat dome establishes over the continent expect fire danger ratings to go through the roof.  Last year the heat dome lasted for weeks.  In the future it will last months.  Trees will dry out and fire will burn them.  North America might look like Easter Island some day.  My guess is by 2150.  The population of earth doubles every 40 years.  That's 16 billion people adding to the problem by 2060.

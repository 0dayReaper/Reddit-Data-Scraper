    "postText": "If earth at one point was a molten rock, how did water get a chance to form?  \n\nWas there somehow already water hidden in the crust and protected from the molten surface? Did our water come from frozen comets crashing into earth and melting the ice into water? \n\nI've never really heard anything about how Earth became covered mostly in water but it seems like a series of weird events.",

            "comment": "Water is pretty common in the solar system. Comets are basically dirty snowballs, for example. Other planets and moons have plenty of water too, Europa being a very clear example. There must have been plenty of water around when the solar system formed.\n\nThat water would have been spread pretty evenly around the solar system. Some of it would have been amongst the material which accreted to form Earth. That water is distributed throughout Earth - not just on the surface, but inside the planet. Don't just think of liquid water or ice. There's water chemically bound in many of the minerals which make up the crust and mantle.\n\nIn fact whatever water was originally present on the surface is gone now. The initiation of solar fusion would have stripped the surfaces of the inner planets of any gases and liquids on the surfaces. \n\nThe water we have in the surface now was mostly originally inside the Earth, brought to the surface by volcanic eruptions. Impacts of comets and other solar system objects would have added a little, but a tiny percentage compared to what has been brought out by volcanic outgassing.",

If so much water evaporates from the surface while it was hot, a lot would collect in the atmosphere and increase its density.

Earth formed from a protoplanetary disc around the sun, by accretion. The precise timeline is basically guesswork because the oldest piece of the Earth we know of is 4404 million years old, and the solar system origin is generally accepted as 4567 million years. We pretty much have zero evidence for the 163 million year gap, it's all modelling based (although the 4404 Ma Jack Hills zircon suggests continents were already forming by that time). \n\nBut regardless whether something which was fully recognisable as the Earth existed when solar fusion started (and likely there would have been some size of proto-Earth), the bits that would become the Earth were at the very least all hanging around the general space where the Earth is today. The inner zone of the solar system - out as far as Mars at least - would have been stripped of volatiles like gases and water by the solar winds. Whether that was stripping whole, formed planets, or a mix of protoplanets and dust, the outcome is the same. In fact, the presence of any water in Earth suggests it wasn't just dust, because dust would lose water while the interior of protoplanets wouldn't. \n\nLook at what happens to comets when they get close to the sun - long tails stretching away, as the solar wind sublimates the ice to gas and pushes it away. Now imagine that, but for everything in the inner solar system, and it's not just passing through briefly but stuff that's permanently there.\n\nDoes that make sense now?",

For context, the average ocean depth is about 5km over 2/3 of the planet. So you are talking about adding multiple times the current total volume of water in all the oceans. \n\nReally this would be a mass transfer of the majority of mantle water to the surface. I think by that point you'd be running into issues of reduced mantle melting due to lack of water, maybe circulation too. Plus it would probably need volcanism so intense the planet would be extremely inhospitable. Venus type atmosphere with much CO2 and SO2, massive greenhouse effect. Probably other unexpected consequences.",

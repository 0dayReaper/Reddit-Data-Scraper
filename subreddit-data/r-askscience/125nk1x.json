Reference #1 posits that the evolutionary precusor to crystallins (a transparent protein that comprises the lens) occurred in sea squirts (Ciona). Reference #2 provides a review of how the crystallins evolved into two super families are kinds that we see today.\n\n1.

Generations were on the order of a few weeks, and evolution was rather rapid fire by comparison to today.  We have a nice stable planet, with stable weather and stable chemistry.  When life was evolving basic forms of biology, that was not quite the case.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBeyond that, there is more than 1 path to creating an eye.",

            "comment": "Your species relationship with food dictates a lot about how your eyes evolved. \n\nIn many land animals who eat primarily with their faces in their food they have an inner eye lid tied to the jaw muscle that closes during eating to keep food debris out. You can see the vestige of ours in the pink muscle stub in the inner corner of your eye and compare it to the full version found in your dog, cat or bird.\n\nThe placement of your eyes is also related to what you eat. Herbivore animals often have horizontal pupils, their day predator animals often have circular pupils and their night predator animals will frequently have vertical pupils. https://physicsworld.com/a/eye-shape-reveals-whether-animal-is-predator-or-prey/\n\nIn humans our ability to see in color was in part due to our evolution with gauging the effort to eat ripe fruit. This also improved our fore arms as more than legs and improved our hand eye coordination and thumb evolution.",

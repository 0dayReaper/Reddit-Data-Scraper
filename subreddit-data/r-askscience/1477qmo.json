In practice there are tons of other processes that can change its mass by much more than this small difference. A speck of dust being added to or removed from its exterior, for example.\n\nThere are also battery types that exchange gas with the atmosphere, like [lithium-air batteries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium%E2%80%93air_battery). They get (measurably!) lighter when they are charged because they lose oxygen.",

Your capacitor will have a charge of Q=CV, or CV/(1.6022x10\\^(-19)) electrons on one plate, which comes out to a mass of 5.6x10\\^(-12) CV kg. The energy of the capacitor is 1/2CV\\^2, for a mass of 1/2CV\\^2/c\\^2 kg or 5.6x10\\^(-18)CV\\^2 kg. Whether these two quantities are equal or not clearly depends on the voltage being applied to the capacitor, and, for any voltage under about 1,000,000 V, the electrons that have accumulated on the plate will have a greater mass than what the relativistic formula gives. You can quibble that I haven't accounted for the cations on the opposite plate, and, yet, even accounting for these, you *still* have an equality that depends on the voltage supplied and which is not true in general.   \n\n\nA capacitor, moving electrons from one terminal to another in a battery, or moving a weight up under the influence of gravity all increase the mass of the system under observation, and this was such a revolutionary idea that 100 years later people still resist it: Doing these things doesn't amount to adding more matter to the system-- in the sense of adding electrons or protons here or there-- but it amounts to increasing the inertia of the system and its resistance to having its motion altered. For low energies, we don't ever notice this and it clearly runs counter to our intuition, but this phenomenon is responsible at the end of the day for almost all of the mass in the universe.",

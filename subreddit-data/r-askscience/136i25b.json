            "comment": "The human body does not generate any energy de novo. The human body converts chemical energy stored in the food we eat into usable energy through a process called oxidative phosphorylation. \n\nEssentially, the food you eat is digested down to base components and eventually converted to the sugar glucose. Glucose goes through a process called the Krebs cycle and is slowly broken down. The energy stored in the chemical bonds of the glucose molecule is used to charge up specific transport molecules which are used by the mitochondria to convert electrical potential energy into a high-energy chemical bond in the form of ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate). The phosphate bond is the high energy bond that essentially all living things have evolved to use to power energetically expensive biochemical reactions. This occurs most efficiently in the presence of oxygen as a final electron acceptor. In the absence of oxygen anaerobic metabolism pushes you more toward pyruvate with lactate \n/lactic acid as a byproduct. \n\nOther molecules can be metabolized such as fatty acids but the breakdown byproducts can also result in acidosis. \n\nPlease note this is an extremely pared down explanation of the glycolysis process. There are many steps and regulatory signals involved. But the end result is glucose is broken down and the energy stored in the bonds of the glucose molecule are used to create ATP which the body uses as an energy currency.",

I watched a YouTube video about developing gravity energy storage and more than one comment claimed it does not work or it is not viable \"because you do not get more energy out than you put in\". Apparently they did not get why people kept telling them that perpetual motion does not exist either\n\nOther popular arguments included \"ton of water weights more than a ton of steel\", \"1m\u00b3(=1000kg) of water weights more than 1m\u00b3(\u22483000kg) of concrete\", and of course the ever-popular variations of \"just use the energy from dropping weight to power the motor that lifts the weight\", which again assumes perpetual motion.",

Further, glycolysis takes place in the cytosol, not the mitochondria.  Mitochondria is where Kreb's occurs, but as was just covered, only glycolytic products enter Kreb's, glucose does not. Further, not all glycolytic products enter the mitochondria, and pyruvate can be converted to lactate and used for gluconeogenesis in the Cori cycle, or enter the TCA cycle in highly oxidative tissue such as cardiac tissue.",

                    "comment": "&gt; The energy stored in the chemical bonds of the glucose molecule\n\nIt should be clarified that chemical bonds don't store energy; they **release** energy when they form, and an equal amount of energy is required to break them.\n\nThe more complete story is that our metabolism breaks the bonds in food to allow the constituent atoms to form **stronger bonds** in other molecules. This is how energy is made available.\n\nThis is sometimes summarized as molecules like glucose \"storing\" energy, but that expression can be confusing to new practitioners, [some of whom go on write somewhat confused textbooks and other learning resources](https://www.ck12.org/book/ck-12-chemistry---second-edition/r6/section/22.1/). Energy has no absolute reference point, so discussion of energy \"in a bond\" is meaningless\u2014only changes in energy can ever be measured, and molecules sit in negative-energy states relative to unbonded atoms.\n\nOne could instead say accurately that glucose is in a high-energy state relative to the corresponding stoichiometry of water and carbon dioxide, for example. This would avoid this particular point of confusion, as also discussed in Vogel's \"[Mythology in introductory biology.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1310672)\" and Storey's \"[Textbook Errors &amp; Misconceptions in Biology: Cell Energetics](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4449438).\"",

            "comment": "So there are three primary energy pathways in the human the body.\n\nBut before we go into that, let's talk about ATP (adenosine triphosphate).  These phosphate bonds store a bunch of energy, and when broken, release that energy which can be used for a variety of things.  You're then left with ADP (adenosine diphosphate) and inorganic phosphate.\n\nThe first energy pathways is the phospho-creatine system.  This energy system will slap a new phosphate onto ADP very quickly.  That new phosphate comes a phosphate bound to creatine (hence the name phospho-creatine system).  This system produces energy very rapidly, but can't produce a lot of energy because you can only store a small amount of phosphocreatine in your cells.\n\nThe next energy system is glycolysis.  This breaks down sugar (glucose, a 6-carbon molecule) into a 3-carbon molecule called Pyruvate.  This system is pretty fast (slower than the phospho-creatine system), and can generate a comparatively large amount of energy because you can hundreds of grams of sugar stored around your body.\n\nThe third energy system is usually referred to as the oxidative system.  This system uses oxygen to convert two carbon molecules into water and carbon dioxide, in the process generating protons that are used in what is called the \"electron transport chain\", which can produce a lot of energy.  However, this system has a lot of steps, so it produces energy pretty slowly.  However, it can produce relatively limitless energy because it can use fatty acids for fuel.  Through a process called beta oxidation, long chains of fatty acids are broken into 2-carbon molecules and enter a process called the TCA cycle (also known as Kreb's cycle).  You have pounds and pounds of fatty acids stored in your body, so you can generate tons of energy from this process.\n\nIt should also be noted that pyruvate, generated from glycolysis, can enter the TCA cycle and produce more energy that way, under certain circumstances.  Similarly, pyruvate that can't enter the TCA cycle gets converted to lactate, which can then be moved around the body and used by the rest of the body for fuel, or even be converted into new glucose by the liver in a process called the Cori cycle.",

            "comment": "There is a fixed amount of water available in the basin that varies only slowly over decade time scales. So if Ethiopia builds a dam close to the source of the water and stores it there this will have results downstream. A minor effect would be the evaporation from the lake which would be lost to the region (the recycling factor in the Ethiopian highlands is small). A major effect would be a quick fill which would temporarily cut off water supply to the downstream areas. A long term effect would be that in times of drought Ethiopia has control over the distribution and can keep more water for itself. All of these are negative effects for Egypt's water security. As for the claim that Egypt's waterflow is increased by reducing Lake Nasser evaporation, this is really a wry statement. It means that they might reduce the level of Lake Nasser by siphoning of more water upstream thereby decreasing the volume of the lake and the area from which it can evaporate. That might slightly reduce evaporation in Egypt which is what they could mean by \"increased water flow\" but I don't see how Egypt's total water budget would increase because of this.\n\nThat said, if Ethiopia's dam is properly managed it might increase the overall water security of the region, something that would also benefit Egypt. It all depends on the amount of irrigation Ethiopia is going to develop with this dam.",

So the dam should result in more total water being available to Egypt and Ethiopia combined, but it seems extremely unlikely that Ethiopia will only draw off the water saved by those efficiency gains.

Yeah i can appreciate that. I would imagine you could irrigate quite a bit of land with that kind of savings. \n\nOr if you would like another example, Lake Washington is a local lake near my home. It is the biggest lake in the state this side of the Cascades  (~782B gal) and I imagine it evaporating ~4 times a year would be pretty crazy. \n\nI see what your doing breaking it down in accounting terms but I am not sure what the argument or the objection to my comment is.\n\n(For the record: I do envy the simplicity of the metric system.)\n\n",

If that water flow was regularized further up the river, where it's cooler and there's less evaporation, then the Aswan dam needs to hold less water, and hence less overall evaporation.\n\nOf course, if Ethiopia uses the resulting lake storage to increase their irrigation, then there would be less water downstream. This is something the Western US states have been fighting over for years, with the Colorado river. It feels a bit condescending to accuse either Ethiopia or Egypt of being \"unable\" to manage the water when the history of the Colorado River Compact shows that we're perfectly willing to make up flow data and otherwise misrepresent the facts to steal water from each other.

Problem is those numbers seem to have been based on abnormally high levels of rain (long-term) which are lower now and places like California are being forced to deal with water shortages and shrinking reservoirs (Lake Mead particularly).  \n\nSo it's likely that Egypt would want such water security and not be dependant on decisions made upstream which could leave them vulnerable at any time.  Doesn't sound like Ethiopia wants joint management though.\n\nEgypt's veiled threat that they do not want war with its neighbours is noteworthy here, especially with repeated warnings from scientists that future wars will be for water, not oil.\n\nFinally, the damming of the Colorado had a large negative effect on its fertile floodplains, and they have recently resorted to creating artificial flash floods.  My understanding is the Nile's floodplains work in a similar way so there may be some damage being done as well which doesn't seem part of the conversation yet, but likely will someday.  In a desert country like Egypt, food security is also a concern here, or will be.",

Everyone wants more, for irrigation or cities, or  navigation, or fishing (even if you don't need it right now, you claim it so that you have the right to it when you DO need it.) So, the Colorado River Compact (headed up by former president Herbert Hoover, which is how his name got attached to the dam) assumed that the average annual flow is considerably higher than it actually was believed to be, so that the different states could be entitled to as much as they claimed to deserve.\n\nInterestingly, Hoover, a diehard conservative, believed that it wasn't the government's place to generate electricity, only the private sector should be allowed to do that. So he fought strongly against adding hydropower to the dam that became Hoover Dam. If it was up to him, Las Angeles wouldn't have had access to all that cheap electricity, and might well have grown much more slowly.\n\n\"Colossus\" by Michael Hiltzik is a fascinating book about the subject.",

However, the \"treaty\" was originally set up when Britain was the owner of much of the area and decided for the interested parties - with a preference for their protectorates, Egypt and Sudan. ",

An agreement like this was also made in 1902, a time when the Ethiopian public wasn't exactly aware of what was happening. Today, Ethiopians see Egypt and Sudan as two countries taking the Nile for themselves when Ethiopia is where the Blue Nile's source is. They don't like the idea of an old treaty dictating how they use the Nile, nor do they have an **outspoken** desire to deprive Egypt of the Nile. ",

I imagine the same argument of population ignorance could be used by any country, on any treaty, so long as it was done maybe more than 50 years ago. Not criticizing, just saying the world could become a very different place. I read some Chinese making different arguments about their northern borders with Russia, as well as the South China Sea. I suppose everyone in the world is refuting history.\n\nAnyways, curious to ask you - what sort of attitude do Ethiopians have towards Egypt and Sudan? Aside from the water issue, that is.",

Bear in mind that this is an issue between two friendly, relatively well-developed countries who are part of the same economic and military alliance, and who have both resolved to settle the issue in international courts. Yet despite all of those seemingly ideal circumstances for conflict resolution, the project is still a point of contention and inflexibility between the two countries.\n\nThe point is that its incredibly difficult for multiple sovereign countries with conflicting interests to successfully negotiate mutual obligations and management of projects on such important and geopolitically locked natural resources as water. There's a reason why experts have been saying for years now that future conflicts over resources will revolve around water more than anything else. Not only is it necessary for the obvious reasons of hydrating people and plants, control over water sources is critical for modern industry, environmental security, and *crucial* for both energy production and energy storage. Many people aren't aware that the single most important and widespread form of energy storage to date remains [pumped hydro-electric energy storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity), accounting for 96% of all active and tracked energy storage installations worldwide. Access alone doesn't cut it--more than ever, actual control over large sources/bodies of water is becoming critical to the national security and stability of nations. Technology can only help so much--resolving the inevitable water conflicts which are rapidly emerging will require tremendous, multilateral restructuring of economies, agriculture, industry, and even populations and borders on an international scale. The costs of doing so will be prohibitively expensive (in economic, social, and political terms) for many nations, which means it's virtually inevitable that instability and even some degree of warfare will emerge as a result. Pretending otherwise is like being back at the turn of the 20th century and ignoring the inevitability of international conflicts occurring over oil. It's not even the result of any inherent failure on the part of our governments, but rather a state of inevitability based on the realities of our existing political, economic, and social structures. The solutions will most likely not be able to emerge as quickly as the problems.\n\nBarring some amazing technological breakthrough, it's almost inevitable that the kinds of changes that would need to take place in order to prevent water-based conflicts won't occur until precipitated by the emergence and devastation of those conflicts themselves. It seems incredibly unrealistic that we'll be able to successfully preempt this future wave of conflict, and as a result we'll only see the appropriate measures taken *after* we've felt the consequences. The hope is that we can mobilize ourselves in pursuit of those solutions sooner rather than later, to minimize the cost of those consequences.",

The damn will change that to a steady flow as power is generated. \n\nAs this mean that the blue Nile will continuously fill lake Nasser, the amount of water needed after monsoon season to irrigate the fields for the next year is less. So lake nasser will evaporate less leaving more water for the Egyptians. At least until Sudan discover the steady blue Nile means that the surrounding fields can yields crops just as in Egypt. \n\nOverall there will be more water to share with everyone not only by less evaporation but also better control so less water will have to be let out into the Mediterranean sea.\n\nHow it will be shared is a political question, where currently Egypt is getting the best deal and Sudan stile have to deal with monsoon floods.",

This is a serious question about Ethiopia's statement. I recall reading the lake trapped huge amounts of silt that were previously carried down the to the delta (resulting in land subsidence there as well); but also that the silt had reduced the depth of the lake to such a degree that water losses from evaporation were huge. Is Ethiopia's statement one that is basically saying \"stop using that useless dam, it's wasting water\" . \n\n---EDIT---  \n\nFound this [education module](https://courseware.e-education.psu.edu/courses/earth105new/content/lesson06/04.html) on the adverse affects the Aswan High Dam had on agriculture, diseases, land subsidence and political tensions in the region. One of the interesting comments is that Egypt essentially allocated for its own use the majority of the water flow over Sudan. Ethiopia's use/claim wasn't even considered even though a full 59% of the total water flow in the river originates in the Ethiopian Blue Nile drainage basin. While the Egyptians may claim the right to prior use, their current usage doesn't forgive or negate their obligation to negotiate  good faith water sharing agreement with the Ethiopians. It's not good enough to say \"We took it first\" when the water comes from Ethiopia and their own needs/rights were never considered.  ",

And considering they are already dealing with rolling blackouts due to too little installed capacity, shutting down Lake Nasser would have massive consequences for Egypt's economy. This is simply not something that Egypt can accept without losing billions of dollars each year.\n\nWhile Lake Nasser is indeed silting up (all dams do) but it still has a maximum depth of 180 meters and an average depth of 25m. While that is not perfect for a dam in such a dry environment, it certainly is not an unusual shape. As far as I know the delta is not subsiding since sediment runoff is small. Sea level is rising however which does threaten the delta and is already causing coastal erosion which is costly to fix.",

When I first read the question concerning reduced evaporation from a downstream lake, I assumed this prediction was based on lower water temperatures (and that still may be the argument Ethiopia is trying to make). \n\nMost dams are built on existing creeks or rivers, and consequently the owner's of the dam are required to meet minimum release levels so that there isn't a dry creek/river bed immediately downstream, which would be devastating ecologically. Sometimes the minimum release requirements have temperature requirements. If you release water from the bottom of a relatively deep reservoir, the water temperature is colder. If you allow the minimum release to be maintained by a skimmer gate or some passive system like a weir, that surface water's temperature will be much higher. \n\nSo, if Ethiopia were to build a large reservoir that maintained a minimum release of water that was much colder than the current temperature of the river, it *could* lead to a reduction in evaporation from a downstream lake.

Because the intake for the aqueducts is on the western end of the central valley, there's a real risk that the *aqueduct intake* may be subject to saltwater intrusion if the amount of water available in the delta is sufficiently low.\n\nSaltwater intrusion would devastate the farms that get water from the aqueduct. It would be an economic catastrophe.\n\nThe general scheme for both projects is that water is trapped behind dams on tributaries of the Sacramento River, and then released into the Sacramento River, and thereby into the delta, for withdrawal by the aqueducts in the delta. \n\nThe idea behind the tunnels is that tunneling under the delta would allow this water to bypass the delta entirely, and go straight from the Sacramento river into the aqueduct --- thereby allowing saltwater intrusion to destroy the delta's ecosystem *without* damaging the aqueduct or the consumers of water provided by the aqueduct.",

The average amount of water that falls in the mountains of Ethiopia is fairly well set. It will not grow. It flows down the mountains to Egypt, and in the shallow Lake Nassir, much of it evaporates into the air. \n\nTo keep as much of the Ethiopian rain in storage as possible, it must be stored in a deep reservoir in the cool and moister high Ethiopian location, then flow it down to Egypt as needed. \n\nThe hot and dry-air Lake Nassir MUST be made smaller, and the reservoirs in the high, cool, and moist Ethiopian mountains MUST be made larger.\n\nEgypt hates this because it gives Ethiopia control over a vital resource, and they do not trust each other.

            "comment": "The proposal would reduce evaporation from Lake Nasser by decreasing its size. However, the upstream reservoir would have higher evaporation than as a river. So to validate the claim, you have to determine whether the decrease in evaporation at Lake Nasser would cancel out the increase in evaporation in the upstream reservoir.\n\nYou would use [The Penman Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penman_equation) for this.\n\nFirst thing to notice is that the evaporate rate is an area rate, expressed in either mass over area and time or depth over time, meaning that a deep water body with little surface area has less evaporation than a wide, shallow water body of the same volume. \n\nThe equation measures things like sunlight, wind speed, humidity, and temperature. Basically, as you would expect, a hot, sunny, dry, windy area is going to have more evaporation than a wet, cold, cloudy area.\n\nThe conclusion is therefore that storing the water in a reservoir in Ethiopia would therefore result in a smaller net irrigation loss storing it in Lake Nasser. \n\nEdit: posted before coffee, missed a major wording error. \n\nAlso source (besides equation): Have master's degree in civil engineering with emphasis in environmental and water resources engineering. Certified EIT in Colorado and Idaho. \n\n2nd edit: I really need to not try to post technical things before my brain wakes up. Fixed another major wording error. For the *same volume*, wide and shallow has more evaporation than deep and narrow. Hot and dry has *more* evaporation than cold and wet. \n\nAlthough you could argue that deep has less evaporation than shallow even with the same surface area as the deep water would act as a heat sink. But that conclusion would come from the equation, not from the unit analysis. ",

The dams location on the border of Sudan/Ethiopian border, limits it as a tool for irrigation within Ethiopia. \n\nHowever, the dam will ensure the blue Nile flow steadily, which will allow Sudan to use a greater part of the water. So the dams effect would be similar to that of the Aswan dam but for Sudan, but unlike the Egyptian Aswan dam, Sudan does not control the amount released, limiting its usefulness compared to the Aswan dam. \n\nDrought is not a consideration. The region have a reliable monsoon season where the Nile stile overflows in Sudan and fill lake Nasser, which is slowly emptied during the year though the Aswan dam. As the blue nile will flow steady, the artificial lake will not get (over) filled in the monsoon season, but the steady flow into lake nasser will make it drain slower. ~~Due to it being a very shallow lake, there will be less evaporation over all.~~ So due to Lake Nasser being shallow, storing part of the monsoon water in the new lake leads and continuously filling Lake Nasser from it will lead to less evaporation overall.\n\nThis makes the response from Ethiopia correct. Assuming that Sudan does not take this opportunity to better feed themselves. All the actions of Ethiopia technically benefit Egypt. Therefore, I read the response as: Not our problem, make a deal with Sudan or explain why Sudan must see the water overflow their fields to benefit yours.\n\nConsidering that Nile stile drains massive amounts of water (around 1/5 of what reaches the Aswan dam ) into the Mediterranean sea. I think Egypt should learn to share.  \n",

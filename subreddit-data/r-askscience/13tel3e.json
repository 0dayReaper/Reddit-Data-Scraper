And these facts were pretty much dispelled when the first robot probes were send to both in the 1960s.  \n\nWhen Mariner 4 made it to Mars in 1964 scientists were surprised to learn that it had almost no atmosphere compared to what was suspected.",

For the moon, that would be the early \n1900s. For Mars and Venus that would be the late 70s with the viking and venera missions respectively.\n\nThis is actually not a bad question. Up until the late 1800s, the moon was thought to have civilizations. The craters that we see today were actually considered to be cities, canyons considered to be canals, and small craters with radial canyons considered to be temples.\n\nTelescopes at the time did not have enough resolution to capture Mars' surface details (and Venus had an atmosphere too thick for light to penetrate), but this didn't stop imagination of people back in the day.",

We only realised Mars didn't have a breathable atmosphere when we sent things to the surface and started doing experiments. Similarly Venus was assumed to be habitable until we sent something close enough to analyse its atmosphere, so yes they were a bit surprised when the realised, which didn't happen until we started to learn more about them and their atmospheric compositions.",

These ideas were from a couple of decades before but had stuck around.\n\nThe first probes were shocking. Venus was a hothouse hell and Mars seemed more like the moon with its cratered landscape. But the moonlike view of Mars has has modified over the decades as evidence of ancient riverbeds and frozen water ice under the surface have given some hope to ideas that some primitive life might linger there.",

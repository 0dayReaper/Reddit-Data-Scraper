            "comment": "Part of the reason it's hard to find is that it isn't well understood, and also because it's an extremely complex process that can break down in many different ways. [Here's an interesting article studying this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941218/). What seems to be a major cause of this isn't the receptor binding itself, but several ways in which the signaling can be interrupted. For instance, free fatty acids can lead to an increase in certain kinases, which can prevent/reduce the phosphorylation of molecules involved in the signaling process. There are many other ways it can be interrupted as well.",

Right before an era of starvation this little bit of insulin resistance might help keep the fat to help them survive until the spring.\n\nNow, for us that never starve, it is a major liability\n\nThis is why a low, fat diet and losing weight will improve the picture.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2612735/",

It can convert them into fat for storage.\n\nBut for the body to store the fat that we eat is much quicker and easier.\n\nFat is usually the last thing to get burned because it is more involved Process then with carbohydrate.\n\nIt\u2019s funny that researchers can check the patient\u2019s accuracy on dietary questionnaires by taking a small sample of the fat on their body and then testing it to see where it came from.\n\nIf they fib while reporting their dietary habits, then they get busted by their own body. \n\nCarbohydrates can turn into fat it\u2019s true, but when we eat fat, it goes straight into storage.\n\nI tend to think that muscle building exercise is the best way to battle insulin resistance, and, of course, overall caloric balance is the key, but a highly effective shortcut is to limit dietary fat.",

            "comment": "If by \"older\" turkeys you mean modern wild turkeys, the answer is \"not even close\". Adult tom turkeys average between 10-20 pounds, with the current world (USA) record being 37 pounds. They are also much taller and wider wing span than any chicken, but neither of these attributes are valuable traits for domesticated chickens, and so weren't bred for.\n\nWild turkeys simply started out much, much larger than jungle fowl, the ancestors of domesticated chickens.",

The rest of North American terrestrial game birds are quite small, 3 lbs being massive for a Chukar.\n\nYou're looking at waterfowl to find a bird of comparable weight after strip to a broiler chicken. Ranging between a Blue Heron to a large Cormorant.",

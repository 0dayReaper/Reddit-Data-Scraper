    "postText": "One would expect the most polar part of Greenland to be the coldest, but the island's north coast has summers mostly above freezing, unlike most of it.\n\nWhy is this? Given the strong contrast between the coastal tundra and the inland ice sheet, it seems to have something to do with the ocean, but the sea nonetheless always remains frozen on Greenland's north shore.",

            "comment": "The Gulf Stream and polar days. The Gulf Stream moves a steady underwater current of warm water upwards, the thermal mass of which constantly releases heat into the local Greenland environment and raising the average temperature. The more inland you are from the ocean, the colder it gets.\n\nAs the sun does not set during the polar days of summer, the extra energy from the sun warms the Arctic (and Greenland), causing melt. It is possible to go as long as five months of constant sun in the northern most parts of Greenland. This melt has been accelerated due to climate change. The Arctic summer melt is normal but the melt has accelerated in recent years. The additional melt has resulted in significant habitat loss for polar bears as they can no longer range for as far or as long and must swim more than they used to.",

            "comment": "ocean currents have great impact on the climate of a region. A reason for this is that water is much better at retaining heat than air, so cools and warms slower, having enough time to travel in currents while doing so. Water coming from hot climates keeps warm enough to warm some cold costal regions, while water coming from cold regions to warm coasts would do the opposite. This is why some islands far north are warmer than their inland equivalents.",

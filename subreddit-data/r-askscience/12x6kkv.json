            "comment": "Your posture has nothing to do with your metabolism. \n\nIt slows down because our body's need for energy decreases. \n\nYour temperature slightly drops down during sleep, which results in your basal metabolic rate going down. Your metabolic rate then has an effect on hormone levels such as cortison and melatonin.   \nYour skeletal muscles relax for the most part as well. Those are the ones that require a lot of your daily energy. Your body then stimulates tissue repair and removal of waste products, which do not require as much energy.",

                            "comment": "It's usually the other way around for mammals - changes in metabolism cause temperature increases/decreases.  Warmer temperatures do ramp up metabolism, but mammals can't handle major changes in body temperature outside of hibernation; most of them die if you change core temp more than 3C. Chemicals that induce fever, pyrogens, prompt the body to ramp up the metabolism, resulting in more heat.\n\nThis distinction becomes much more meaningful in ectotherms, whose metabolism is far slower and doesn't usually run fast enough to generate substantial heat.  When infected with a bacteria that generates pyrogens, ectotherms will develop a \"behavioral fever\" by basking in the sun.",

            "comment": "When we sleep, our bodies take a bit of a break and switch gears into recovery mode. This is the reason behind the metabolic slowdown during sleep. It's less about the zzz's and more about the body conserving energy to repair and rejuvenate itself for the next day.\n\nRegarding the whole lying down or sitting up quandary - it's not really about the position. You could be hanging upside down like a bat, and your body would still take this opportunity to power down a bit.\n\nYou can check some articles on [metabolic boost](https://www.lumen.me/blog/lumen/7-proven-ways-to-help-boost-your-metabolism) and the science behind it. Spoiler alert: good nutrition and regular exercise trump sleep position any day!\n\nSo, your metabolism slowing during sleep is your body's natural way of saying, \"\"Hold up, let's fix things up and get ready for tomorrow.\"\" Rest easy knowing it's all part of the process.",

There's a lot of other changes, outlined by other posters, but at the end of the day (hehehe), it's about energy savings.\n\nHumans have a very modest drop in metabolism and temperature, but other species can have much bigger drops.  Hummingbirds basically become \"cold blooded\" over night to save energy.  Hibernation is the same, just longer - internal metabolism drops to save energy, and temperature drops as a result.",

            "comment": "The word metabolism is heavily abused by pop science and diet fads as some kind of ethereal magic dial that determines your fate.\n\nWhether naturally \"fast\" or \"slow\" metabolisms even exist is a matter of debate. There are metabolic disorders which can cause a deficit or excess in energy production, but these have predictable symptoms - sluggishness or insomnia, for example. \n\nWhat we do know is that \"metabolism\" is the rate at which your body produces energy (i.e. burns calories), and this varies constantly in response to the body's current energy needs. And for everyone without any specific kind of disorder, the primary determinant of their energy needs - their \"metabolism\" - is their weight and activity levels,\n\nOne might argue that a vertical body requires more calories in order to maintain the vertical, to pump blood against gravity, but you'd be talking single-digit percentages, at most. For the most part, your metabolism has slowed down during sleep because you're not doing anything and thus your energy requirements have dropped.",

            "comment": "Aside from lack of movement, lower body temp, slower respiration etc., another major component that is in effect is that digestion goes on a break and digestion also uses a lot of the calories of your BMR. when your body is not producing the acids/chemicals used in digestion it is saving a lot of calories that are then used for tissue repair etc. Also, the brain is a very expensive organ calorie wise and sleepy time is when your brain reorganizes itself from the day and compresses information deleting what is not necessary and filing away the beneficial information. Also due to decreased respiration and lower body temp heart rate slows all contributing to \u201clower metabolism\u201d. But I really think of it as just lower calorie usage because this rest period is a part of metabolism so I don\u2019t think your body is maki g new cells any slower, it\u2019s just that your body is burning less calories during rest due to some processes taking a break.",

            "comment": "During sleep your body's metabolic rate slows down because you need less energy to do basic functions like breathing and heart rate. Hormones like cortisol and adrenaline are also lower during sleep, which reduces metabolic rate. This slowdown allows the body to focus on repairing and restoring itself.",

            "comment": "It's about heart and respiratory rate. Heart rate does absolutely have to do with posture and respiratory rate has to do with heart rate. Your thinking is on the right track but your brain also sends signals lowering your body temp and slowing those manually when you sleep, regardless of your posture. \n\nYou can do the experiment while conscious yourself, measure your pulse over 5 minutes standing vs laying down. Your heart doesn't have to compensate for gravity when you are lying down.",

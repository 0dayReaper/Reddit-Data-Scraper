            "comment": "Milk sugar does not separate without a lot of processing.\n\nLactose is about 4-5% of the weight of whole milk.  If have ever used any sort of sugar in your life, you will have noticed that sugars of almost any type dissolve in water really easily.\n\nEvaporating about 2/3 of the water will cause the lactose to start to crystallize out.  Lactose can get up to about 18% by weight before any changes start to happen.\n\nYou can displace the lactose by adding in a metaphorical bucket of table sugar.  *Sucrose* is more soluble than lactose, so it displaces the lactose which solidifes out.  Analogy: a big strong fat man pushing into a crowded train and the little skinny person is forced out.\n\nHeating is a poor option because lactose will react with proteins in milk.  It irreversibly glues itself to the protein.",

In that little volume section you have a concentrated sugar+water mixture that is heavier than the coffee, so it sinks.  It's almost like you have a balloon of sugar coated in a thin layer of water.  You are mixing two different liquids into each other.\n\n5 seconds later and the sugar is starting to *diffuse* into the rest of the liquid.  \n\nIf you stir, the whole diffusion process is faster.  But without stirring, it takes enough time that you can in a clear glass watch the two liquids blending into each other.",

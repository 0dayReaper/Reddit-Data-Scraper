            "comment": "Antibodies by themselves are not capable of damaging or destroying things. They act as markers that 'paint' a target so that other immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes etc) can phagocytose/attack the offending target e.g. bacteria/fungi/parasites/viruses/virus infected cells. \n\nIn autoimmune conditions, the antibodies mark the host's own cells erroneously, and the other immune cells do the damage.\n\nImmunosuppressant drugs dampen the activity of these immune cells, so while you may still have antibodies marking the host cells, they won't get damaged by the immune system. \n\nUnfortunately as a side effect, there may not be an effective response mounted against a real invader e.g. microbes",

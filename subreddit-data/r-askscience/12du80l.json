    "postText": "We all have heard of the brain eating amoeba, Naegleria Fowleri which kills almost everyone infected with it. How does it defeat the immune system? I mean, it's a pretty strong system. So how does it do that? And why can it? Given that it is so rare, how did it evolve such amazing capacity to fight the immune system, when it presumably didn't have much human contact and doesn't normally even attack humans?",

            "comment": "Basically, [PAM](https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/freelivingamebic/index.html) needs physical penetration through the nasal mucosa (it does possess some enzymes to help facilitate entry) to reach the olfactory nerves. These nerves of course are open to the environment so anything that can gain access will be able to enter into an [immune privileged area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_privilege) and be shielded from the immune system. From there, it simply devastates the cribriform plate and then the brain itself. Typically, we don't even know what it is until the patient is already dead.\n\nLuckily, PAM is an extremely rare disease so our innate immune systems are quite robust. Just remember to not slam raw water into your nose on purpose, i.e. Neti pots.",

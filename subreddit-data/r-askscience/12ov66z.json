A comparison in the animal kingtom would be trying to cross a fish and a dolphin, since both swim.\n\nUseless because these organism live in seawater, where salt concentration is quite constant. If you \"water\" plant with seawater, the water will evaporate, but not the salt, and soon enouth you will have much, much more salt than in seawter, a concentration that would kill most seaweed.",

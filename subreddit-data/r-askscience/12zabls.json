There were a few hangers on, but it was mostly just the lystrosaurs that did well. They adapted to the lower oxygen world by developing big barrel chests. Meanwhile, the archosaurs, which are diapsids (\u201ctwo holes\u201d in their skull, vs the \u201cone hole\u201d synapsids like us) had a cleverer adaptation: they had a one-way lung passage which is much more efficient, and allowed first the group that gave rise to crocodilians, and later the group that gave rise to the dinosaurs, to have active high metabolisms in the low oxygen Triassic world. Birds and crocodiles still have these lungs, and they do birds quite well up in the sky where oxygen is lower.\n\nAn interesting early adaptation of our synapsid ancestors was specialized teeth. Most dinosaurs (with a few notable exceptions like heterodontosaurs) and all extant crocodilians have fairly undifferentiated teeth. The next time you see a dimetrodon skull in a museum, take a look at its varied teeth.",

Not only were there plenty of flying dinosaurs--like most extant birds--but the reason pterodactyls weren't dinosaurs has nothing to do with whether or not they flew and everything to do with ancestry.\n\nAt the time, I recognized it as bad reasoning, but *also* for the wrong reasons. I took it as an example of what I would later learn was called a No True Scotsman fallacy. If we say they aren't dinosaurs because they didn't fly, then if we say they *are* dinosaurs then it's no longer true that dinosaurs didn't fly and then the problem disappears. Of course, that isn't the actual reason they aren't dinosaurs anyway. But I was incensed then, and I'm incensed about it now for completely different reasons. It takes special talent for someone to be wrong no matter how you look at it, and that may have been the point that I started feeling rebellious towards school.",

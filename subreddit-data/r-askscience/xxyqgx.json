            "comment": "It means that it is impossible for our universe to be both local and real, one or both of those properties must be false. It means that either there are interactions at a distance in our universe or that the underlying foundations of our universe behave in a very exotic and strange way, taking actual form only when indeed interacting with anything.\n\n**Local** means here that all interactions take place in the direct spatial and temporal neighborhoods. While the temporal part is intuitive for us, the spatial one is not - we are used to perceiving and even manipulating things at a distance. But this is all an illusion (we see only photons that reach our eyes and we use electromagnetic radiation to transfer sound to our wireless headphones) and from what we know so far, our universe is entirely local as we know not a single action at a distance. Even famous quantum entanglement is an inherently local phenomenon because for the entanglement itself to happen, both particles must be in a direct neighborhood.\n\n**Real** means here that all quantum objects indeed have specific properties since the moment of their creation, just like we are used to perceiving the world. To simplify a lot, whether they are hard or soft in touch is defined at the very moment when they were created. If they were non-real instead, whether they are hard or soft would be determined only when you actually touch them, long after their creation. In other words, to answer if our universe is real is to answer if we perceive quantum world behavior in a probabilistic way because it is inherently probabilistic (non-real universe) or because we lack some kind of knowledge about the measured object (real universe).\n\nIt's important to note here that there is no such thing as \"passive observation/measurement\" in the quantum world. You can't just sit idly by and watch quantum objects behave. You have to actually \"touch\" them, to actually interact with them, altering their state.\n\nThat said, it's also important to state that we don't know which of those properties is actually false or even if both are false. We only know that they can't simultaneously be true.",

Fair warning, this might be entirely wrong. (Note I use the word \"properties\" probably incorrectly, but I think it helps get the point across for me):\n\n1. Local=True Real=False:\nInteractions must occur within spacial/temporal neighborhoods. Quantum objects *possibly* collapse, or do *something else*, according to prevailing theories only when interacted with, and such properties don't really exist before doing so.\n\n2. Local=False Real=True:\nInteractions can occur outside of direct spacial or even temporal neighborhoods. Quantum objects have a hidden variable that determines their properties before being interacted with.\n\n3. Local=False Real=False:\nInteractions can occur outside of direct spacial or even temporal neighborhoods. Quantum objects *possibly* collapse, or do *something else*, according to prevailing theories only when interacted with, and such properties don't really exist before doing so.\n\n4. **Local=True Real=True: Proven impossible by the Nobel prize winners.** It cannot be the case that interactions are local and quantum objects have a hidden variable that determines their properties before measurement.",

            "comment": "Hi /u/kabir9966!\n\nQuantum entanglement is a phenomenon, in which the measurement results of two entangled particles are correlated. I.e. if  I measure the spin of 100 pairwise entangled particles along the same axis, the results of the entangled pairs will always correlate. In other words, when one measurement gives spin up, measuring the other will always give spin down. This holds true, no matter how far the two particles are apart, or how short the time between the two measurements is. \n\nOne possible explanation of this phenomenon goes as follows: The measurement results follow a secret plan that is created together with the entangled pair. That is, the measurement results are deterministic. You can imagine this like hiding a small item in one of two identical boxes. Then you take one of the boxes to the moon and open it. If you find the item, you instantly know that the other box is empty. This would be a very neat solution, as no signal would have to be exchanged for you to gain this information, thereby side-stepping the problem of relativity.  Furthermore, this theory is [realist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_in_physics#Local_realism), in the sense that the state of each object is well-defined at all times. \n\nThis is called a [local hidden-variable theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_hidden_variable). Here, the term \"local\" signifies, that this theory holds on to the constraints of relativity, any object can only influence its immediate surroundings. This constraint is also called \"locality\". The idea of this theory is, that the measurement result of all quantum mechanical particles is pre-determined from the moment of their creation in such a way, that conservation-laws are respected. When we measure one particle of an entangled pair, we get the secretly pre-determined measurement result, and thereby instantly know the state of the other particle, without the need for  any signal to be exchanged between them. \n\nAs it turns out, we can test whether or not such local hidden variables exist using the  [Bell inequalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_inequalities): Veritasium has made a [pretty good explainer how this test works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuvK-od647c).\n\nThe bottom line is, that such a hidden-variable theory would lead to different outcomes that what we measure. \n\nConsequently, the local realist theory described above cannot be true. We have to let go of at least one of these constraints: The universe can respect realism, but not locality; or it could respect locality, but not realism; or it could respect neither. \n\n\nA theory that respects locality but gives up local realism would mean quantum states really remain in an undetermined state of superposition until they are measured, and in the moment of the measurement, the wave function of both particles instantaneously collapses (according to the Copenhagen Interpretation anyway). There are no hidden variables pre-determining the outcome of these measurements, and no signal is exchanged faster-than-light.\n\nThe Nobel price was given for experimental evidence that realism does not hold locally.",

My understanding is that when the spin of a particle is measured, it is either up or down, but it has no spin before being measured. Then, its entangled partner also has no spin until measured, but will always be the opposite of the first. What I'm getting hung up on is how do the entangled particles not have spin until they are measured? I don't understand how the two particles don't always have a spin of up or down, regardless of whether they've been measured or not. I don't know if that makes sense, but it's hard to explain with my limited knowledge.",

You should think it more as \"the particle has every possible achievable spins for its quantum state, all associated with different probabilities\". And the measurement will make the spin observable collapse onto one of the achievable states, and the states will be realized with their given probabilities.",

Like if the universe was an empty vacuum except for 1 particle, that particle wouldn't really have any defined \"speed\" because there's nothing to reference its motion against. Add a stationary/or differently accelerating particle to this universe and suddenly your first particle has a defined speed measurable in relation to the second particle. So if a particle with undefined spin interacts with a \"spin-detector\" then the spin of the particle is suddenly relevant &amp; needs a defined answer. Sort of like the information relating to certain quantum states only exists when you ask the universe for it. Or like if it was a video game and these quantum states are like the textures of an object - the game only renders higher &amp; higher resolution textures as you look closer &amp; closer at the model. The detail is there, but only if you're asking for it. Or for the universe, only if interactions demand a defined value",

It is weird and counterintuitive, as many things are in QM.\n\nOur expectation that particles have specific values for quantities like position, momentum, spin, etc. is a natural one, but one that is grounded in an intuition honed by evolution over millions of years responding to pressures on a scale much larger than the scale on which the weirdness of QM can be seen. Simply put, it is ok to accept that your intuition chafes at QM weirdness.\n\nPretty neat that our science has advanced beyond what our minds were evolutionarily prepared to imagine.\n\nAs for spin and other intrinsic properties of particles, the answer is to remember that particles are not \"super tiny bits of stuff\". That is a definition we foisted on them. It is better to think of them as \"these things which have the property of having indeterminate conjugate properties until measured\". It is a little hand-wavy but it is the only way I ever managed to re-calibrate my intuitions. Spin is just something we invented to quantify a property of quantum particles.

As the name suggests, the CI is only an *interpretation* of the quantum mechanical formalism, as the formalism itself unfortunately does not tell us *how* exactly the measurement influences the particles. This is known as the [measurement problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem).\n\nThe tragedy of quantum mechanics is, that while the formalism works spectacularly well to *predict* the outcome of experiments in a statistical manner, it does nothing to *explain* what is going on. General Relativity, for example, is a theory that both gives us tools to predict the outcome of experiments, *as well as a way to interoperate it*. Quantum mechanics is not as cooperative, unfortunately, which is why we have [a plethora of interpretations of the formalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics).  \n\nThat being said, the Copenhagen interpretation solves your question by noting that the collapse of the wave function does not transmit *information*. While Alice's measurement forces Bob's particle into a well-defined state, there is no way for Bob to *know* that. That is, there is no way for Bob to know if their measurement result was random or pre-determined. As relativity only forbids the faster-than-light transmission of information, and the collapse of the wave function does not transmit information, there is nothing preventing this collapse from occurring instantaneously.",

And they still found the same result.

When you observe a quantum object, the theory tells you the probability of obtaining a result, but there is always an element of randomness to it (e.g. the cat has a chance of being alive and a chance of being dead).\n\nThis has led some people to wonder if quantum mechanics is an incomplete theory, a statistical tool that fails to discover the \"real\" properties of objects. If it is, there has to be some hidden information that it just can\u2019t access. (Was the cat \"really\" alive or dead before I observed it? Or was it really neither and did it only gain a definite state due to the observation?)\n\nThe experiments showing Bell\u2019s inequalities to be true proved that there cannot be locally hidden information, meaning that there is no such thing as a \"true\" hidden property of the particle that you discover with a measurement. Reality is inherently random, and the measurement forces the particle to adopt a state that it did not have in any sense prior to the measurement. (Yes, the cat was in fact neither alive nor dead, it\u2019s not that we just couldn\u2019t know.)\n\nEdit: The cat is kind of a nonsense example because yes, the cat would know. It\u2019s not a quantum object, and it\u2019s properties have been defined through interaction with other things (the air around it, the box, etc.). But it\u2019s a good proxy to talk about particle spins, for instance.\n\nEdit 2: In this context, \"measurement\" really means any exchange in information, meaning anytime the measured object interacts with something else.",

That is, at large scale, things are essentially always measured in some way.   Perhaps you could explain what it quantum mechanics means by \"measurement\"?   Surely not necessarily observation by a human.   So what measurements count and what don't?   Genuinely asking.",

                            "comment": "Let me see if this analogy helps. I have two marbles, one white and one black. I shake them in my hands to confuse their identities. Then you take one without seeing it and I take the other without seeing it. Later, when you look at your marble and see it\u2019s white, you know that mine is black. No information passed between the marbles, we just know that if one is black the other is white. You could consider those properties \u2018entangled\u2019, revealing one also determines the other. Now, marbles are a macro scale object. Even if you didn\u2019t see it, your marble was white all along. Looking at it didn\u2019t matter. For a long time, that\u2019s what we thought of quantum particles as well. We might not know the property of a particle until we measure it, but it still had that property and measuring it just reveals it. Turns out, that isn\u2019t so. A quantum marble is neither black nor white until something \u2018measures\u2019 it, which means it interacts with something that needs to know if it\u2019s black or white. Only at that point, is it determined which it is and, even though we separated the marbles hours ago, for a quantum marble it can always be either until measured. It\u2019s not just a case of our not knowing, it really exists as a \u2018superposition\u2019 of both black and white up until it needs to be one or the other.\n\nLet\u2019s go a little further. I gave you a quantum marble and kept the other one. If one is black, the other must be white. They also have other properties, like both being round and smooth, etc, which are identical. These are quantum marbles, so they both exist as a superposition of black and white right now. You go down the street and come to a door that will let anyone with a marble through. You pass through because you have a marble, but that doesn\u2019t \u2018collapse\u2019 the marble into one color. You come to another door that will let anyone through with a square marble. You cannot go through, your marble is round. This does not measure if the marble is black or white, so it\u2019s still in a superposition. You come to a final door that let\u2019s through only people holding a black marble. You then have to reveal your marble and either it is black or white. There\u2019s a 50% chance it will be black and you can pass through. This is how an object is said to be observed or measured. When you reveal your marble like this, we also know what color my marble is, even though nobody looked at it and nothing measured it. How does my marble know when your marble collapses into being black or white? That\u2019s the question that\u2019s being answered. One idea was that your marble, when measured, sends a signal back to my marble. This has been shown to not be true.",

Or is it one of those things we just need to accept because it explains stuff at the quantum level?

What is it about observing something that locks in certain properties? \n\nOne other question, does this apply to things that have previously been 'observed'. For example, if the cat climbed into the box instead of somehow being magically created there.\n\nThanks",

The border between them is fuzzy because the distinction is entirely man-made.\n\nSchrodinger's cat is an analogy for what the world would be like if macroscopic objects behaved as if they were quantum.

That probability cloud might look in a certain way depending on its environment. An electron that is bound in an atom will remain bound there until it is kicked away, but its actual position around the atom is best described as a probability cloud that is denser in some places and less dense in others. According to the Copenhagen Interpretation, this probability cloud *is* the particle. It is not merely a descriptor of where the true particle is located, because there is no true particle beyond the probability cloud. If the probability cloud then interacts strongly with something else, it will 'collapse', meaning that it suddenly becomes sharp and well-defined at a single spot with a single momentum - the cloud becomes a point, which will then immediately start spreading out again as a cloud, until you measure it next time. The collapse is truly random, but obviously you have a much higher chance to measure the particle in a spot where the probability cloud is denser.\n\nThe Copenhagen Interpretation is not the only interpretation, and there are many scientists that dislike it. However, this proof that the universe is not locally real does strengthen the Copenhagen Interpretation somewhat, but I don't have enough expertise to say how much exactly. There's also also the possiblity of a superdeterministic universe, where everything is predetermined - this would be impossible to prove, but also impossible to disprove.\n\n&gt; So basically we cannot see a particle\u2019s spin change while we are looking at it, \n\nThere's really no such thing as constant observation. You cannot keep looking at a particle. You can only do intermittent observations.",

Essentially what you stated there was hidden variable theory - that when something is not in your field of view (i.e. you haven't measured it yet) the underlying information (hidden variable) of the object still exists. Quantum mechanics says that object exists in a \"superposition\" of all of the possible states until the moment that object is observed. \n\nTo tweak your analogy a bit, it would be like in the game when you turn around there is a 50% chance an enemy is there and kills you and 50% chance they show mercy and you survive. The code waits until you turn around (measure it's value) and then generates a random number between 1-100 where if it's less than 50 you die. Before you turned around, that enemy was considering both killing you and showing you mercy, but they didn't decide until you turned around.",

That could be human/animal visual observation, or it could be the ball touching the box. Since they're touching, they're interacting and the respective wave functions of every particle collapses into a determined state. \n\nMacro objects interact all the time in more ways than just touching. Heat radiation, photon reflections, gravitational interaction all come to mind. On the quantum particle level, those interactions need to be more intentional, aka a free floating electron does not interact until we shoot another one at it, or it collides naturally with something. The theories around what happens on a subatomic level is where the Nobel prize and other research is advancing and teaching us more about the world",

    "postText": "Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Physics, Astronomy, Earth and Planetary Science**\n\nDo you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: \"What would happen if...\", \"How will the future...\", \"If all the rules for 'X' were different...\", \"Why does my...\".\n\n**Asking Questions:**\n\nPlease post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.\n\n**Answering Questions:**\n\nPlease only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.\n\nIf you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).\n\nPast AskAnythingWednesday posts [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27meta%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).

These can be minimum, maximum, or saddle points (valleys, hilltops, or Pringle chips as visual aides). The 5 Lagrange points of the Sun-Earth system contain 3 saddle points and 2 maximums. The two most important saddle points are L1 (between the sun and earth) and L2 (on the opposite side of earth).\n\nIf you consider the z-value to represent gravitational potential energy, the slope represents how an object on the graph would move from areas of high energy to low energy. The L1 and L2 saddle points has zero slope so an object placed on it would stay there. However, a completely motionless satellite is impossible when the Lagrange points are moving as earth orbits the sun. Because the saddle points have areas of high energy in the path of earth\u2019s orbit, an object placed on L1 or L2 would follow earth in orbit.\n\nTo give a real world example imagine a truck towing a half pipe with its raised ends in parallel to the truck and a ball resting at the center. When the truck accelerates the ball will roll up one side and then return to the center as the truck stops accelerating. However if the truck were to somehow accelerate perpendicularly to the half pipe, the ball would roll of the half pipe and onto the road as nothing is there to stop it. For satellites using Lagrange points, there is less need for them to correct their orbits as they only need to correct deviations towards and away from earth.\n\nHopefully that helps.",

The dent represents the gravity well of the object. The more massive the object, the greater and deeper the dent. \n\nAnd anything at the center of a spherical object experiences zero gravity, because it's being pulled equally in all directions by the surrounding mass. \n\nSo in the rubber sheet analogy, would we expect to see a standard dent-shaped dent, or more of an annular depression with a peak in the middle, like a mountain with a moat around it? (The top of the mountain here would just rise to the level of the flat area of the sheet.)\n\nI'm guessing that it's just a denty dent because the area of zero gravity is still at the bottom of the gravity well, but I could be wrong. Or maybe the question is silly and doesn't make sense even in the overly-simplified and inaccurate rubber-sheet analogy. Either way, thanks for taking the time to read this.",

Everybody knows which way it goes around; it backs away from the outgoing water. Now the question is this: If you had a lake, or swimming pool -- a big supply of water -- and you put the sprinkler completely under water, and sucked the water in, instead of squirting it out, which way would it turn? Would it turn the same way as it does when you squirt water out into the air, or would it turn the other way?\n\nThe story in his book is hilarious they tried testing and blowing up the water container and making a mess in the lab. except they did in the room with the particle accelerator, and got smack on the wrist by being told to do it in the freshman labs.\n\nBut your instinct is right, but it is not the only interaction.

Could our solar system be in orbit around something near the center of the arm that could explain the evidence for planet nine? If no, then what causes that rotation in the arm? Or am I completely misunderstanding our solar system's movement? (Please clairify where I got lost)",

The Sagittarius arm is closer to the center (at least the nearby bits are) so its mass contributes to that, but we aren't orbiting it or any object in it specifically.\n\nThe evidence for planet nine is based on objects within the solar system, much closer to us than any other star and so basically unaffected by the sun's motion through the galaxy (so long as it doesn't take us close to another star, which it doesn't seem like it has for a while).",

Can you elaborate on how we know that, and how could we similarly make statements strictly from theory about the spins of other particles? How would the physics of an electron change if it had a spin of, say, 3/2 or 5/2 as opposed to 1/2?",

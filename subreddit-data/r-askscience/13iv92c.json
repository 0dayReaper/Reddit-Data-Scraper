            "comment": "I can't give you a complete answer, but one major contribution to the blurriness is from viewing the hologram with white light. The hologram was made using monochromatic (or nearly monochromatic) light. Since holograms like this one work on the principle of diffraction, and diffraction depends explicitly on the wavelength, you expect all features in the viewed hologram to be distorted when viewing it with polychromatic light. My intuition is that the scale of the holographic image is changing with wavelength, so you are effectively looking at many different images of different colors, each with a slightly different scaling, which smears edges and gives the edges a color gradient (this is clearly visible on the ropes).",

This turns it into a wavelength filter, which is why you see only one colour, despite looking at it with white light. The reflected colour is slightly off from that of the laser wavelength used to record it, as the film shrinks a bit during processing.",

            "comment": "My dissertation relied heavily on the mathematics underlying optical holography.  I'm afraid that I must say, the answers you've received so far I've found to be quite troubling (ranging from accurate but incomplete to wildly incorrect).  \n\nA hologram is made by measuring the superposition of a monochromatic scatter and reference wave from a coherent source.  The superposition measurement, be it on film or ccd, allows for capture of the phase information of the light on the boundary/surface where the measurement takes place such that, when the hologram is re-illumined (optically or with digital simulation), diffraction of the incident light field occurs and the original wave field on the opposite side of the boundary is recreated.  In essence, the hologram itself is a measurement of the \"boundary condition\" of the light field across that particular surface.  What is important is that the light field that you view from holographic reconstruction is, in theory, the field you would view as if you were viewing the scattered light during the original recording.  Hence, you might as well treat the two (viewing the hologram vs the original scattered light) as being the same.\n\nSo what is it that you\u2019re actually viewing when you see the object?  Here, the object is being bombarded with a planar light source (presumably for a laser).  At each point on the object\u2019s surface, light scatters.  That scattered light is what you view.  To first order (the only important order), the scattered light may be viewed as a superposition of spherical waves emanating from point sources at each point on the object\u2019s surface.  \n\nNow, to view a crisp image from this scattered light, you must focus it.  Even if it were just a single point that you wished to view sharply (as opposed to a whole object), the light must be focused.  The spherical wave form is analogous to applying a diverging lens on a plane wave source.  If you were viewing the hologram/scatter with your own eyes, the lenses in your eyes would do this automatically (or In the case of the photo above, a lens is used to capture the photograph from the hologram).  And transverse resolution will suffer based on the lens\u2019 focal length vs the axial distance of the points on the scatter object source.  \n\nAn object being viewed from a hologram will generally have axial extent.  If the object were coplanar with the hologram surface, you could view the entire hologram in focus together (though the light still needed to be focused to begin with).  With axial extent, there will be increasing focal blur with distance that differs from the length at which you are focused (as is shown in the image you linked).  What\u2019s important about the hologram though, and (among other things) which distinguishes it from a photograph, is that since the light field is recreated, you may refocus on different depths when viewing, as if the object was actually in front of you.  That is in contrast with a photograph which has a fixed focus and will capture any blur without the option to refocus.  \n\n[This paper](https://opg.optica.org/viewmedia.cfm?r=1&amp;rwjcode=josaa&amp;uri=josaa-25-7-1744&amp;html=true) can give you a derivation of the math underlying your question.  It can (probably still) be found on scihub but does require a mathematical / optics background of a more senior undergraduate physics student.",

                            "comment": "&gt;Is there some sort of mathematical design for a lens surface to reduce the axial distortion?\n\nIsh... There are fundamental limits to the resolution that can be obtained both in the transverse and axial directions for a given measurement apparatus and light wavelength.  You may have heard of these as Nyquist limits or systems that are diffraction limited (these are essentially the same thing).  That said, yes are specific optimal geometries that you want your lens to have for a given wavelength and distance.  \n\n&gt;Does it even use lenses when recording the hologram?\n\nThe answer is again, \"ish\"... lol.  Strictly speaking, no it is not necessary to transform the light in this way.  With that said, there may be practical reasons to do so in the physical design of the recording setup.  For example, [Gabor's original paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/161777a0) indicated the use of a focusing lens for the scatter source light prior to its scattering from the target object.\n\n&gt;Do differing mediums and laser intensities) frequencies affect the quality of the hologram resolution? \n\nYes\n\n&gt;Is this truly a capture of the object's surface state down to the molecule?\n\nNo, and for a number of reasons.  \n\n1) Optical holography is a \"classical\" theory and doesn't have the precision to speak at the quantum (molecular) level.  \n\n2) The spatial resolution of the measurement apparatus matters.  Analogue recording media are not truly analogue.  There is a limit to their spatial precision but it is far below our own resolution capacities.  Digital devices also have spatial limits (worse than those of analogue media). \n\n3)  This reason will probably be less satisfying as it is mathematically dependent and that is difficult to describe here with only words and in such short form.  With that said... there is an inherent asymmetry in resolution from holography.  This follows more easily (at least on paper) by transforming the light field from the hologram into the Fourier domain to analyze the the measured frequency bandwidth in each direction.  The axial bandwidth is far less than the transverse bandwidths which means that the axial resolution will always be worse than the transverse directions (If you want to know more about why, the notion of \"Ewald Spheres\" in scattering theory are explanatory).  \n\n&gt; Will degradation of the material affect the quality of the image over time?\n\nFor a hologram measured on a physical substrate?  Yes?  For a digital recording?  It's just numbers.\n\n&gt;\"infinite resolution\"\n\nThe resolution is not infinite.",

In the real world we deal with a massive field of incoherent light. There\u2019s simply too much to discern a coherent image so an aperture is required. An aperture and lens work to bring some space into focus, effectively concentrating the signal over the noise. (When using a lens and large aperture, anything out of the field of focus, with registrable intensity, comes through as the original noise - this is the source of the \u201cdepth of field\u201d)\n\nBut in these holograms there is a single source of coherent light. You are right that reflected light from the same source will cause it\u2019s own effects, but there is only one source of direct light and a fixed amount of light (over the duration of the recording)\n\n&gt;Also, bear in mind that you are looking at a photograph of a hologram, and a camera has its own lens.\n\nThis I had wondered about. Of all the pictures I\u2019ve seen the \u2018focus\u2019 effect seems to vary. I really want to get my hands on a real one again to see it with my own eyes :)\n\nEdit: formatting/wording",

That appears as a bit of a blur. Depth of field is an understandable way to describe it, but the two things are separated.",

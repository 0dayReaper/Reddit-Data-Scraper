A small bump or even the beginning of a wing that doesn\u2019t function properly wouldn\u2019t be selected for right?\n\nIt seems like the kinda appendage that would need to be mostly there and mostly functional but wouldn\u2019t be spontaneously selected for over the course of many generations.",

            "comment": "I will assume you are asking about feathered wings, since that is often the example used to argue against evolution. This is an example only of how they could have evolved which avoids the \"what use is half a wing\" argument.\n\n1. Feather evolve, probably from initially slightly uprated scales which trapped air near the skin for insulation and warmth. These may have initially been only in juveniles (due to their size) and then evolution caused them to be retained into adulthood when the insulating effect proved to be advantageous. You have a feathered dinosaur \n\n2. Some individuals/species start to use these feathers to signal/for display purposes. Think how a cat puffs itself up to look bigger when it's afraid. Longer feathers are an advantage because they make an individual look bigger so longer feathers are selected for and the length  gets longer. \n\n3. Some species with the longer feathers are arborial or semi arborial, longer feathers allow them to glide between trees or trees to the ground safer or further. There is therefore more selection pressure for longer  feathers.\n\n4. A some of these gliding feathered dinosaurs/proto-birds have slightly different muscle structure that allows a very limited form of flapping/powered flight, this gives them an advantage over simple gliding individual (they can go at at least somewhat against gravity), they are selected for and you start to get powered flight.\n\nThis would obviously occur over millions of years and many species would evolve and die out before you compete the transition from non-avian dinosaurs to birds.\n\nHowever the basic principle in this idea is that each step has an evolutionary advantage in and of itself, remember evolution does not have a plan or a final form it is aiming for. Each step must be able to survive and reproduce (be evolutionarily fit) in and of itself. It is also vital but often hard to grasp just what kind of time period we are thinking about for the evolution of significant features such as wings\n\n(The wings of bats would probably have evolved similarly, loose skin with another purpose gave an advantage to a gliding species so exaggeration of the feature was selected for, then active flight evolved from this gliding species)",

            "comment": "A lot of people immediately jumped to gliding as an answer but I don't think that's actually supported too well with fossil evidence. There have historically been two schools of thought: Ground-up (jumping to flying) and Top-down (gliding to flying). The closest fossil relative of pterosaurs seems to have been a cursorial insectivore with adaptations for jumping. This could provide a direct selection pressure for launching and powered flight, since more air time and control increases hunting effectiveness.\n \nBirds are more awkward because they were essentially pre-adapted for flight. Dromaeosaurs it seems already had pennaceous feathers on their arms and hands, which is often hypothesised to have allowed better stability and manoeuvrability when hunting and mounting prey, and probably played a role in sexual selection or signalling somewhere along the chain. Wings also developed independently several times in paraves, with many species being arboreal, because their high metabolism, integument and pneumaticized bones all double up as great adaptations for flight. \n \nWe don't have transitional fossils of bats AFAIK so they're anyone's guess. Interestingly, the lack of transitional fossils could indicate that powered flight arose pretty quickly once the selection pressures arose, which is consistent with flight evolving for predation. Gliding however has evolved dozens of times in modern animals alone, but mostly as a means of escape, and it works pretty well without the need for assisted lift. I would infer that gliding probably doesn't create a strong selection pressure for powered flight. But as always, the fossil record is pretty scarce so the correct answer is \"we don't really know\".",

The physics of flight for example only work one way, so no matter what your using to fly it has to work in that way, provide downward and back facing thrust to lift and go forward while reducing the drag to maintain speed, and specific forms to produce lift.\n\nThey also didn't just evolve wings out off nothing on a smooth patch of torso, that implies evolution has goals and endpoints, it does not.

As the slope gets higher, the chicken extends and flaps its wings to keep balance, as well as a way to gain speed upwards and jump more safely from a high place to a lower place, in the same way a cat or a monkey extend their arms while falling. Flapping its wings is also a way for roosters to have more freedom to use their claws when they fight for females, since they can jump higher and fall more slowly. \n\nEven small wings would have been enough to do tricks like those, so clearly birds had small advantages when they grew long feathers under their arms, long before those feathers were long enough to glide; but the most obvious reason to grow long feathers is for sexual display. Feathers are colorful without any pigments, and those colours are clearly used to impress the opposite sex, so birds probably evolved longer feathers to cover the female bird whole visual field and whole visual spectrum.",

            "comment": "It's something of a mystery.  \n\nFlying is really difficult to evolve.  So difficult, it seems to have happened only about four times in the history of life: insects, pterosaurs, bats, and birds.  The uncertainty in the number is because it may have evolved independently a few times in related therapod dinosaurs closely related to birds.  \n\nYou can contrast this with gliding, for example, which has shown up numerous times in animals (and even in plant seeds).  Or colonization of the land, which also happened many times.  \n\nExactly how it happened is...not well understood.  We have terrible fossil records for early bats and pterosaurs, and limited fossil records for early insects.  Birds are better known.  But even there, the origins of bird flight aren't exactly clear.\n\nContrary to a lot of what you see in this thread, gliding isn't necessarily a precursor to flight.  It might have been in insects, but in general the needs of a wing for flying are somewhat in conflict with the needs of a gliding membrane.  \n\nIn birds and other therapods, flying animals seem to have arisen from animals which were capable runners.  The basic \"wing\" structure of feathers on the front limbs goes back far before flight or any possibility of gliding, and seems to have been used for display and possibly for stabilization when running, clambering around, and attacking prey. \n\nPterosaurs and bat origins are very mysterious.  There's still a lot of debate about whether bats started as arboreal animals gliding with their proto-wings, or as ground (or perhaps branch) dwelling animals leaping up to catch insects with enlarged, perhaps webbed hands (and then developing the ability to control their descent).  \n\nPterosaurs are also mysterious.  As with bats, there's a lack of anything like transitional fossils, and differing clues pointing to terrestrial or arboreal lifestyles for their ancestors.  \n\nAnyway, here's some papers\n\nInsects:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982216314610\n\nBirds:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982220309994\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215009458\n\nhttps://web.p.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&amp;sid=52897b05-a12d-464f-a813-c9bb2207d408%40redis\nBats:\n\nhttps://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mam.12211\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rick-Adams-3/publication/278713398_Time's_Arrow_in_the_Evolutionary_Development_of_Bat_Flight/links/561fc0d208ae70315b551153/Times-Arrow-in-the-Evolutionary-Development-of-Bat-Flight.pdf\n\nPterosaurs:\n\nhttps://doc.rero.ch/record/329918/files/ser_edp.pdf\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08912969709386566",

For it to even work at all multiple organs and systems all had to develop simultaneously each of which individually seem to be counter-productive to gaining an edge in surviving to reproduce until they could work as a coordinated capability. Yet it does exist so something is at play we don't understand and it isn't simply 'survival of the fittest' in each generation.",

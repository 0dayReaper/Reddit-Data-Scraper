    "postText": "I read a comment recently that said:\n\n\u201c\u2026the clean air act in the 1960s which regulates sulfur dioxide emissions, the cause of acid rain, removed a lot of the particular matter from the air which reflected away from the surface or the earth\u2014it was partially responsible for the earth warming.\u2014We screwed with the atmosphere and in trying to do good, it did clean up the acid rain (somewhat) but came back and bit us in the a** with a warming effect as it let more of the sun\u2019s rays through\u201d\n\nIs this true to some extent? Did the clean air act, which I always thought was an amazing policy because of the wonders it did for our air quality, have the unintended effect of accelerating global warming by boosting the greenhouse effect?\n\nI know if I looked this up, I would only get a bunch of hard to understand research papers, so I am asking it here. Any answers are greatly appreciated.",

            "comment": "Sort of, but it's a bit more complicated. \n\nTo start, sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere does lead to reflection of some portions of incoming solar radiation, so elevated concentrations of it (and certain other particulates) in the atmosphere can lead to reduction in temperatures. This is actually also the main mechanism by which very large volcanic eruptions can lead to temporary global cooling episodes, i.e., sulfur dioxide injection into the upper atmosphere (e.g., [Robock, 2000](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/1998rg000054)), though in this case the details of volcanic eruptions matter *a lot* in terms of whether this leads to cooling (e.g., consider the discussion in this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/volcanic_eruption_climate_change/)).\n\nReturning to the question at hand, anthropogenic emissions of sulfur dioxide can cause these same cooling effects, where again, the magnitude and details of the emissions matter with respect to the outcomes. This property of sulfur dioxide was recognized at the time of implementation of things like the Clean Air Act and is actually also the origin of a persistent \"denier\" talking point, i.e., \"Scientists predicted we were heading into global cooling in the 1970s, why should we believe them now?\" As explained in this [other FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/ice_age_1970s/), this has a nugget of truth in that there were papers at the time projecting that if our SO2 emissions continued to increase as they were at the time, this could lead to global cooling (e.g., [Rasool &amp; Schneider, 1971](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.173.3992.138)), but as very clearly laid out by [Petersen, 2008](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/89/9/2008bams2370_1.xml), even at this point in time, the consensus was that increasing CO2 emissions would swamp this signal and lead to global warming.\n\nAnd there in lies the complication with respect to the question, i.e., we're pumping *a lot* of different things into the atmosphere all that have different impacts on the temperature (and other properties) of our atmosphere, and often on different timescales. The complications can be seen very clearly with respect to another frequently asked question over the last ~3 years, i.e., \"Did the covid lockdowns influence climate change?\" As discussed in [yet another FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/covid_lockdown_global_warming/), this is not a straightforward question to answer because we're not talking about just reducing CO2 emissions (which have a warming effect over a long time), but also emissions of things like NOx (warming over a short time) and SO2 (cooling over a short time), etc. When we're considering the net climate effect of our emissions, we have to factor in both the positive (in the sense of increasing temperature, not positive in a beneficial sense) and negative inputs to try to deduce the net result.\n\nAs highlighted in the lockdown example, SO2 and CO2 (specifically) are also operating on very different timescales. CO2 is (all things considered) a relatively weak greenhouse gas, but has effectively a long residence time so a given unit of CO2 produces warming for a long time. In contrast the cooling effect of SO2 is short lived since the residence time in the atmosphere is short. This means that us reducing our SO2 emissions had a relatively quick effect whereas the warming we're experiencing now effectively represents the impact of CO2 emissions from decades prior (and the CO2 we're emitting now, assures continued warming for decades to centuries into the future in the absence of active removal).\n\n**So in summary**, if we're pumping out CO2 and SO2 into the atmosphere, these are broadly working in opposite directions in terms of their influence on temperature, so whatever climate effect we see reflects the sum, e.g., if our CO2 emissions reflect a +1C / decade warming, but our SO2 emissions reflect a -0.5C / decade cooling, then the observed warming would be +0.5C / decade (in a *super* simplified sense). Thus, if we reduce our SO2 emissions, but don't reduce (or rather continue to increase, as we did) our CO2 emissions, then we would expect the rate of warming to increase because SO2 is no longer masking some portion of the warming driven by CO2, but we have to also consider the time lag between the rapidity of the impacts of these different compounds. While it's a bit of a semantic argument, that's probably the better way to frame the point, i.e., it's not that SO2 emissions reduction \"boosted\" the greenhouse effect so much, but rather it reduced some portion of a cooling effect that was superimposed on the warming effect (which had generally always been larger anyway). Arguably, the other negative externalities of large SO2 emissions (e.g., acid rain) outweighed the potential cooling benefit, but this gets into a lot of hypotheticals (e.g., how would SO2 emissions have scaled with CO2 emissions in the absence of the CAA and similar measures?) and value judgements (e.g., what's worse, acid rain or more warming? neither are good...).",

                    "comment": "I think the impact of acid rain on carbon sequesting plant life (particularly in the absence of the CAA) would likely counteract any cooling effects in the long term. So if you do a full mass balance (tricky I know for something like this), reduction of SO2 might even be a net benefit in terms of global warming.",

                    "comment": "One important point that Kurzgesagt mentioned in their geoengineering video was that if we relied on pumping SO2 into the atmosphere to counter CO2, we would be FORCED to keep pumping SO2 into the atmosphere in a future with a higher level of CO2. If we stopped it would result in extreme warming due to the higher levels of CO2 that people would have allowed themselves to pump into the air. \n\nConversely, reducing CO2 would have to become a long-term process as the SO2 now in the air could lead to global cooling if there is not enough CO2 to counteract this. And fossil fuels are a finite resource so CO2 levels will have to reduce at some point in the future. \n\nThe Kurzgesagt video on youtube is called 'Geoengineering: A Horrible Idea We Might Have to Do'  for anyone interested",

            "comment": "It's true in that sense, that SO2 loves to form particles in the atmosphere, which will lead to an increased amount of cloud droplets (or at least cloud condensation nuclei, i.e. particles that can form cloud droplets). SO2 is one of the crucial precursor vapors for new particle formatio, and therefore has a large global effec. But yeah, overall in the bigger picture the reduction of SO2 was definitely a good thing!\n\nInterestingly, there are climate engineering scenarios where the idea would be a controlled release of SO2 or other hygroscopic precursor vapors to the atmosphere in order to increase the clouds cover and therefore increase the cooling effect. What is interesting in this approach is the extremely short lifetime of SO2 in the atmosphere, which in the particle form is only a few weeks, as compared to the &gt;100 years of CO2. So it's actually one the climate engineering approaches which we can rapidly cancel if/when something unexpected happens!",

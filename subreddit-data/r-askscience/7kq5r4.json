            "comment": "Other responses have gone into what makes an individual long-lived. This post will address the question as OP phrased it: what determines the lifespan *of a species*? And what's the deal with human longevity?\n\nMany people have a concept of aging that could be described as the \"wear-and-tear\" model. Basically, the notion is that as you go through life, you accumulate nicks and dings from macroscopic scars and stretch marks to accumulating microscopic injury and DNA damage. Eventually it's just too much and you run down. *It turns out this concept is markedly untrue, at least at the species level*.\n\nDrosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, has been the workhorse of many experiments, including those studying longevity, life-history theory, and evolution. Many years ago, researchers working with flies did an evolution experiment. They selectively bred fruit flies for longevity, and in a remarkably short time they had flies with dramatically longer life-spans than is the norm. These flies weren't evolving novel genes in just a few generations, rather, they had recombined existing alleles in ways that lead to longevity. The important thing to note is what happened when these long-lived flies were re-introduced into a 'normal' population. Did these super-long-lived flies thrive? No, quite the contrary. Within a few short generations, any sign of longevity had disappeared. In competition with their 'normal' counterparts, they were immediately outcompeted. (I tried finding the original papers, here's a [modern replication](http://www.pnas.org/content/97/7/3309.full) of these sorts of studies, with more precision.)\n\nWhat these researchers discovered was that while longevity is perfectly possible, and within the realm of already-existing genes in most populations, this potential isn't realized *because of trade-offs*. Increased longevity is exchanged for decreased fitness in other areas. Perhaps these long-lived flies in nature would be less likely to evade predators, have more difficulty finding food, or are less likely to find a mate. Everything has a cost. Note that this is different than the 'programmed' idea of death, that your genes have predetermined a time of death for you. In the life-history model of aging, it's not that DNA 'wants' an organism to die, far from it - it's just that other traits (that hurt longevity) are more directly advantageous to the propagation of genes, and so combinations of genes with these traits out-survive and out-reproduce the combinations that lead to longevity.\n\nThe immune system gets interesting. Unless something else kills it first, it's all but inevitable that an animal will die of cancer. The ticking clock of mutations accumulate, eventually leading cells to proliferate out of control, breaking internal apoptosis mechanisms, evading the immune system, and eventually killing the host organism by hogging the lion's share of nutrients and energy.\n\nWhat exactly is a 'cancer resistance gene' or a 'cancer susceptibility gene'? Why would anything evolve a 'cancer susceptibility gene'? That doesn't make sense, and they don't. Rather, it's a gene that is perilously close to breaking something important, if it mutates. *Redundancy* is an important concept. If you have 3 copies of something important, you're more or less ok if 2 of them break. If you only have 1 copy, you will be in trouble quickly. Animals that tend to be long-lived, such as elephants and whales, tend to have many, multiply redundant copies of genes involved in important functions like apoptosis and immune regulation - the sorts of genes that when they break ~~tend to cause~~ are no longer able to stop cancer.\n\nHumans don't seem to have nearly enough multiply-redundant copies of these sorts of genes to explain all of our longevity, while it might contribute somewhat. We don't look like elephants or whales in this respect. This sort of evolution towards longevity would reasonably be expected to take a relatively long time to evolve, as many duplication events would have to happen, and then spread through the population. \n\nIt seems humans are probably like the flies that were selectively bred specifically for longevity. In humans, the [grandmother hypothesis](https://www.nature.com/articles/428128a)  conceives of human longevity as something that is directly advantageous to gene propagation ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_hypothesis) introduces the concept well). It's a sort of grandiose kin selection, where elderly humans in prehistoric times were still able to contribute to the survival and reproductive fitness of their children, grandchildren, and extended relatives. Unlike other species that experience a rapid deterioration after their own ability to reproduce goes into decline (such as salmon after spawning), humans *could* contribute into their later years, and so longevity was selected for. Maybe we're not so unlike our experimental flies after all.",

There have been experiments in which animals were put into an environment with none of their natural predators, and as their average lifespan extended they found the individuals were reproducing later and later. Not really an answer to your question but just an illustration how the two things could be linked in principle. ",

E.g. late sexual maturity means a longer potential life span.\n\nOn a very shallow level I can definitely see how achieving reproductive capabilities later than other individuals might be a disadvantage as you may die of external causes before you can reproduce. Longer generations would make a species adapt slower to environmental changes, which may also be a weakness.",

The ability reproduce quickly is the reason bacteria become resistant to so many things so quickly. \n\nIt's also the reason we don't rapidly adapt to bacteria.\n\nIt's partially because we already did. The development of the immune system was the adaption to bacteria. \n\nIt becomes interesting when you look at how fast bacteria reproduce in proportion to humans. \n\nE.Coli for example reproduce every ~20 minutes or so. If we give \"modern humans\" 100k years of existence then it only takes E.Coli a short time to go through the same amount of \"evolution\" to an environment as humans did in 100k years. \n\nEven if the numbers are off by quite a bit, a sludge puddle of E.Coli will \"evolve\" as much as humans have in 100,000 years in a few months. 1 HOUR for E.Coli is roughly 60 human years of \"evolution\" (assuming 20 year generations in humans). So by the time this post is a day old the E.Coli on your food will have had 1440 human equivalent years. \n\nIt gives an interesting perspective on the microbiological world that inhabits and surrounds us. \n\n",

While some properties are controlled by a single or a few genes (like colour blindness), many properties and conditions are caused by the interplay of hundreds or thousands of genes, and that is without taking into account epigenetics. Turning this around, one gene may also be responsible for hundreds of properties. Apparently, thousands of \"autism genes\" have been identified. Trying to repair those will inevitably lead to other problems.",

Even social behaviors are often directly influenced by a stark shift in life span. Humans are an actual field of study on this particular phenomenon. As we have only recently nearly doubled or lifespans. The results are already quite telling, if not troubling in determining future problems. We are starting to have fewer children rather than more, and also having them later in life. This seemingly minor thing is already effecting the biology of future generations as having children later in life creates all sorts of health issues that were rarer in previous generations. Something you have to consider, is that nature often takes the path of least resistance. The most efficient route, rather than the most advantageous one. It would seem obvious that living longer would allow for more opportunities for reproduction. But opportunity might not necessarily be the driving force. A shorter life span might actually be the most efficient course to promote high reproduction rates in a species. \"No time to dawdle. We gotta make babies.\" mentality. As to where with a long life might have a \"I'll get to it eventually. I got time.\" perception. \n\nEdit: there is a theory. That this effect has happened before. Where adults lived longer, thus had few children later in life. Therefore causing later generations to have increased risk for health problems. That would in turn shorten their lifespans. Thus creating an accordion type effect throughout history that slowly corrects for these shifts in lifespans. ",

From what I gather from his book it seems like it's one of those questions that hasn't necessarily got the same amount of attention as other topics in biology.\n\nThere's some interesting correlations that he explores including the average number of heartbeats per species, metabolic rates, vascular systems etc...\n\nIs there anyone out there with a background in biology who's read this book?

Not to mention that women can have kids (at reduced rates) through early 40's, and men considerably longer than that.  Not everyone lived.  Many died very early in life, but many lived into their 60's and longer.  \nAdditionally in sports like boxing, really tall people have reach etc, but in street fights or even sports like judo, there are advantages to having a lower center of gravity.  Which is another hypothesis.  Another still is running through heavily forested areas favors shorter people.  Another is (well supported by body type to climate correlations) that in hot regions tall skinny people radiate heat better, but in cold regions it's better to minimize the surface area/volume ratio.  I'm sure I'm missing some.  \n\nAt the end of the day I do think a range, as we do have, is optimal at a population level.

Some of the leading theories are longer term parental care or multi generational families.  Think about it this way: why should women ever go through menopause?  It's because having non reproductive women in the social group increases the fitness of her offspring. ",

A jellyfish doesn't need to do terribly much; they simply float from place to place, feeding on microscopic organisms that drift by. Thus, they don't have a whole lot of need for a complex brain.\n\nWorms are another good example--they don't have a centralized and complex brain, but they do have a nervous system that allows them to do simple things. A worm really only needs to do a few things consciously to survive: Burrow, avoid heat, and wiggle around if something tries to grab it. All tasks that can be completed without a brain.\n\nIn fact, even in the human body, a lot gets done without having to get the \"main\" part of the brain involved. A lot of automatic actions in our body are handled by our brain stem (heartbeat, unconscious breathing, contractions in your digestive tract), and even some dramatic body movements (like when you automatically pull your arm away from a hot stove) don't even need to involve the brain--just your spinal cord and brain stem.\n\nHumans and many complex creatures get a lot of benefit out of having complex brains--we use them for memories, processing of sights, sounds, complex thoughts, emotions, and more. But when you're a jellyfish whose lifestyle centers around floating from place to place, and you don't have eyes, ears, a nose, or any need for memories or complex emotions, it's fairly easy to get away without having a brain.",

Nice to not 'eat' and live of sunrays, but plants are basically fighting chemical wars every minute against attackers who want to profit from their stored energy. They can't walk away so they possess other, very complex, ways of warding off a plethora of different types of attackers. Some even include attracting animals which will hopefully kill the attacker. Think insects, large mammals, fungi, bacteria, viruses... And yet the land is green because plants have so many ways to defend themselves or simply grow faster then they are being eaten. \n\nSome organisms are mutualists with plants, but even then there is the rusk of a mutualist becoming a parasite, so there are many checks in place to make sure the mutualist stays beneficial. This is the case for root bacteria, mycorrhyzal fungi and pollinators. \n\nBesides that, plants also cannot move away to find a better spot for water availability and hide from harsh weather, so they also have ways to deal with that. And moreover, plants are constantly at war with each other, competing for sunlight and some even poisoning the soil so that other plants have trouble establishing there. \n\nMuch of plant life is at least as complex as animal life!",

The marginal cost of maintaining that shell for another breeding season is low relative to the potential turn around another cohort.\n\nThere are many evolutionary strategies in which long life is effective.  Think of it this way, MacDonalds won the burger race by being the low cost leader. Five guys also had a great strategy by offering a diffentiated product. They are both making burgers, but they are doing it in very different ways.\n\nA Tortoise is like five guys: Huge investment in shell, also, let's just get huge so almost nothing can swallow us whole or bite us. That way I can have cohort after cohort of babies.\n\n\nAnother long lived organism is cod. Since cod grow every year, their reproductive organs also grow. A 5 year old may produce 20,000 eggs but a 40-50 year old cod will produce millions of eggs each year. ",

Lets say you want to test if longer parental lifespans aid in the success of the offspring.  One way to test this hypothesis would be to find a model organism with a short life cycle which exhibits extended parental care, like a rodent.  You would then create an experiment where some parents were allowed to remain caring for the offspring for a longer period while others were removed earlier to simulate an early death.  You would then record how many offspring survived to adulthood from each treatment.  With sufficient replication you can perform a statistical analysis to determine if there was a difference in survival rate between the two treatments.  If you can demonstrate this is consistent in multiple model organisms then you can apply it to other species, although of course not with 100% certainty.",

Hydrogen peroxide is produced as a result of leaks accross complexes I and IV of the mitochondria. These molecules can damage lipids proteins and dna in the cell. As this damage accumulates in the DNA you get a break down of systems.  The smaller a species the more metabolically active they are per gram of tissue (full body metabolic rate scales roughly with size). So smaller animals are producing more things like hydrogen peroxide per gram of tissue which is accruing damage faster.  We have an antioxidant response which limits the damage done. While I don't know about parrots specifically birds have developed very capable antioxidant responses especially in birds that migrate. So it may be that if this theory of aging is true, parrots are retaining some antioxidant capacity or DNA repair mechanism from their past. But honestly I don't know. Personally I think the theory helps explain why we see an increase in lifespan generally with size but it's not the whole story.  It has been implicated in diseases but to attribute all of aging to it seems premature. But I haven't heard any other theory that explains the relationship between aging and body size any better. ",

If an animal is able to reproduce at a very young age, they are going to allocate all their resources to be able to reproduce as fast as a possible. For example, a mouse won't use the resources it gathers to offset cancer because it produces at a young age with relatively large litter sizes. All the food and energy it uptakes will be used  mainly in reproducing. For humans, we reproduce much later in life and have much smaller litters and less reproductive episodes so in order to ensure that we pass on our genes we must take preventive measures to try to resist and slowdown the aging process.

More likely, it would invest its energy in producing as many offspring as quickly as possible.\n\nAn animal that is not easily predated is more likely to invest energy in processes that lengthen lifespan, and focus on raising just a few offspring (quality vs. quantity).",

Smaller mammals are challenged during urination due to high viscous and surface tension forces that limit their urine to single drops.

This means that certain traits are inherently linked as they are derived from the same line of genetic code. \n\nSo for example: Labradors have webbed feet that make it easier to swim. The gene that codes for webbed feet however also codes for the trait for floppy ears. So as long as Labradors have webbed feet, they will have floppy ears despite there being no evolutionary advantage, it just comes with the territory.\n\nThe purpose of hox genes is that it sorta 'compresses' how much coding is required. Rather than code for every finger, there is one structural blueprint for 'digit' and regulatory genes that determine growth. It's these regulatory genes that are what make humans unique.\n\nSo if you recall your anthropology, Australopithecines were short, short lived, and had a more or less a chimp-sized brain. All these fearures are controlled by a regularory hox gene. When that hox gene mutated to exhibit increased growth it affected everything: We got taller, our brains got bigger, and our longevity was extended.\n\nThis is why we take an unusually long time to mature compared to other animals: our 'stretched' hox gene makes us have an extra long maturation phase which is why humans retain many childlike behavioral traits into adulthood and why we have a relatively early sexual maturation even though socially it is recognized that full brain development does not occur until later. \n\nSo the reason humans live so long and have big brains is kinda by accident. We just needed to be tall and the rest just got dragged along with it.",

This is the strategy a species takes to maximize its fitness and its contribution of genes to the next generation.\n\nR strategists, like rats or insects, are fast reproducing, create many offspring that are less expensive, and live short lives because their reproductive life span is short but this is how they maximize their fitness.\n\nK strategists, like humans, live longer and are more capable of a longer time-span for reproducing, (it's believed menopause exists in humans so that they can help family with THEIR offspring, maximizing that individual's overall fitness or passing on of their genes) so offspring is more \"expensive\" and typically live longer.\n\nSo maybe an extensive lifespan contributor is based on these strategies and that species' ability to maximize its fitness and overall genes present in the gene pool?",

(And life-span of said creature).\n\nInterestingly, lobster telomere don't get snipped off, and it's a little unclear if there is an associated hard limit to number of mitotic cell divisions for lobster. Some lobster have been found with surprising size and age..\n\nAnd I here is a link for fun: https://www.drjoedispenza.com/blog/general/telomeres-what-does-a-lobster-know-that-you-dont-know/",

                    "comment": "Telomeres are not a good way to determine lifespan. Maybe as a relative comparison between different humans, but even then, a healthy, 69 year old person may have longer telomeres than an unhealthy 10 year old. If telomeres were the determining factor, then mice would live much longer than humans. A mouse telomere is 5 times longer than a human's, but it's lifespan is 30 times shorter. Now, shorter telomeres are correlated with diseases and such because of DNA damage that can occur or mitotic errors. In vitro, cells senesce (stop replicating) after a certain number of replications which is known as the Hayflick limit. This is where the idea that telomeres are a sort of clock for our lifespan. But other problems come from oxidative stress that results in accumulating DNA damage over your lifespan separate from the problems associated with short telomeres. There are many different things going on that will ultimately determine our lifespan, and it cannot be conveniently attributed to one single factor. That reality is that we are much more complex and telomeres are not a good measure of our lifespan.",

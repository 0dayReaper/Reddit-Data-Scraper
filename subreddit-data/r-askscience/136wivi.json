You have to get the windmill up onto cleaner flowing air too.",

If you have hundreds or thousands of km of nothingness, there is so little surface friction that the wind will reach such a high speed that it changes the surface to be taller (dunes or waves) in a way that increases friction.\n\nSmooth ice sheet surfaces do the same, except that they are much less vulnerable to generating any sort of surface instability. Thus, winds in Antarctica or greenland even right at the surface can be a bit ridiculous. That, and the ice sheet itself actively cools air and this causes it to lose bouyancy and race down the sides of the glacier.",

            "comment": "It would generate less power, less consistently. That's a major reason why taller wind turbines have been developed.\n\nThis is because of the *wind gradient* - winds become faster, and more consistent, away from the surface. It's theoretically zero speed at the surface, and usually modelled as a polynomial function of height, with an exponent between 0 and 1 (for example an exponent of 1/3 is a cube root), up to the *gradient height* of a few hundred metres where the wind speed reaches its 'free space' speed.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_gradient",

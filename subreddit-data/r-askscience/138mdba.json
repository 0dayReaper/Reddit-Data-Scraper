It evolves and changed into many directions but there are 3 factors that are key:\n\n1.  How communicable it is - how easily and rapidly it can infect from one infected host to the next. \n\n2.  How virulent it is - how fast it spreads within the host. \n\n3.  How lethal it is - how much damage it causes to the host.  \n\nThere are some viruses that are deadly but don\u2019t spread easily.  HIV/aids virus is one.  You can\u2019t catch it from airborne particles. It\u2019s mainly a blood to blood contact. \n\nThere are viruses that are spread quickly and easily:  the common cold.  \n\nThere are viruses that are somewhere in the middle:  herpes - usually a mucus membranes to mucus membrane contact and then it can spread fast or retreat into dormant areas of the body and wait for opportune times to flare up in order to become communicable.  Not deadly but causes some debilitating conditions sometimes (shingles). \n\nSo any of these traits evolve and then the trait combination that makes it most successful survives.  \n\nIn the case of Covid, strains that are deadly and kill quickly will be less successful because killing your host limits your ability to spread.  Strains that spread quickly and remain virulent for a long time without incapacitating the host (ideally, minimal to few symptoms) is the best way to gain dominance in the competition against other strains.   \n\nIncapacitating your host limits your reach to infect others.",

I think this evolutionary direction depends on the type of virus and it's mechanism of spread. Some, it isn't necessarily an evolutionary advantage to make us less sick, especially if the disease is not spread primarily directly human to human (think the plague). But human respiratory viruses (such as in covid) I believe do tend to follow a pattern of becoming more mild, just because it means the host has more time to go around breathing and/or coughing on other people before they lay up in bed and/or die.",

The virus mutates randomly, and those that make themselves more virulent but less fatal end up infecting more people, so that strain gains dominance. Less virulent strains might come along and try to infect a new person, but if they've already had an infection, their immune system may already be competent and deal with the virus before it can spread. So more deadly strains not only run the risk of killing their host before they spread, they also run into the issue of potential hosts already being infected by a less dangerous strain and making it more difficult for the deadlier strain to spread.",

We have bulk which gives the immune system time for the right things to bump into the wrong things, but it's still mostly just chemical gradients creating new chemical gradients and cells in the environment blindly reacting not to an 'intruder', but to whatever stimuli it is presented with.\n\nThe thing with rabies is that in that large body, it is more or less harmless, it's actually the fact that for the most part it doesn't do anything at all to harm us that has prevented us from developing immune factors to deal with it, and that when it does kick in to harm us it kills us so effectively that there's nothing for the body  to really do...it is actively killing us while the immune system is just starting to react, and it's so overwhelming that the only thing the immune system 'could' do to kill the virus would effectively kill us as well.",

The placentae of different mammals varies considerably (which is in large contrast to most other systems which show considerable conservation), and so do the retroviral genes that are found in mammalian placental genes. It appears that the integration of syncytin-like genes has happened multiple times throughout evolutionary history in different species. So it is very likely that these different events have driven the divergence and diversity of mammalian placentae, but it was not necessarily a pre-requisite event for the first placenta. If it was, you'd expect all mammals to have the same gene from the same ancient retrovirus. Our placental retroviral genes are Syncytin-1 and 2, but these only entered our genome \\~25 million years ago, while the first mammals go back up to \\~180 million years.",

Immunology is amazing, but your immune system doesn\u2019t stand a chance against that rate if evolution just like you said, you completely hit the nail on the head. All of that evolution and incredible complexity is merely to make the human body look slightly less appealing as a place for them to set up camp.\n\nThe other factor that discourages pathogens from taking up residence in your body is the huge amount of bacteria that live on and within your body but generally reach a balance with one another so that no one species overgrows and causes problems. \n\nIn short: all the immune system does is make your body look like a horrible, hostile desert that already has a bunch of tough residents who don\u2019t want you there. In spite of that, there are still bacteria that have adapted to do it anyway, and we know those as pathogens. \n\nIt\u2019s bacteria\u2019s world and we\u2019re just living in it.

There's so many combinations we're basically guaranteed to have a match somewhere.\n\nThen, the cells get activated and multiply. \n\nAfter we beat the infection some cells remain as memory cells, so next time the army doesn't need to be trained again, sk to speak.\n\nPathogens evolve to survive us by a few ways.

Current estimates are about 50% survival rate, depending on the strain.\n\nEbola spreads through blood contact so it creates situations where the potential for blood contact are as high as possible. This generally means putting as much of our blood outside the body as possible, which is... less than ideal when it comes to human survival rates. We kinda need that blood to stay inside, ya know? But if you manage to survive through that long enough for your immune system to start making antibodies, you're probably gonna make it through.\n\nCompare to covid which spreads by infecting our lungs and forcing us to expel air to infect other lungs. Still somewhat lethal, but destroying your lungs and suffocating you is only really a side effect. The main purpose is to spread to new hosts and it does that quite easily even if the infection clears from your system via immunity.",

The name already answers your questions. Tons of slightly different antibody creating Plasma cells are created. Most of them are eliminated because they either attach to your own proteins(which would create an autoimmune disease) or they just don't bind that well to the pathogens receptors. The ones that are left pump out antibodies which are created for the specific purpose of fighting that particular pathogen. Your body will restart that process for as long as there are foreign pathogens in you.",

But probably the main reason a pathogen doesn\u2019t want to overwhelm it\u2019s host is because these pathogens need the host living in order to continue draining resources from it. A pathogen that kills it\u2019s host in a few days then has to go through the process of finding a new host. Pathogens expend various amounts of energy to do this, but they certainly aren\u2019t GAINING resources in the transition. So they have an insensitive to transition as little as possible, and keep their hosts relatively healthy. \n\nThere are a lot of other reasons too, but the one stated above is probably the most influential. In short, pathogens don\u2019t want to overwhelm a host. They want that host to go right on collecting energy and resources for the pathogen to use.",

Bacteria are organisms that survive entirely based on its surroundings, let's say in this case we only talk about harmful bacteria, ie ones that cause diseases in humans. They don't want to kill us because that kills them. So they can, but it's much more advantageous to them to let us survive.\n\nAs for viruses, they aren't organisms but they function similarly.

A dead organism is still made up of the same macro-nutrients as a live one, but the dead one doesn't fight back.  \n\n\nSo a demonstration of the lifecycle being important here: Bordatella pertussis for example, fits your description well, it requires humans to survive and to transmit. Clostridium botulinum in contrast can survive in soils as spores, and it produces a toxin that is exquisitely toxic to organisms with nervous systems. If an animal becomes affected by C.botulinum and its toxin, and subsequently dies, the bacteria now has a meal that wont fight back, and if another animal eats the carcass, it has a new host to infect and kill. If nothing else eats the carcass, it can sporulate in the soil until it incidentally contaminates something else.",

The general functions of our  immune system developed incrementally in very distant species that had much shorter life spans.  Our multiple \"immune cells' strategies likely developed as defensive systems in single cell or low complexity life forms that could compete more quickly. Animal immune systems also have a major advantage over bacteria and virus in that they can create entirely unique cells that mainly just serve to protect and are designed to be disposable. Bacteria have to use thier whole self for invasion and defense but it cannot go \"all out\" to be as disposable. Subspecialization is a huge advantage that keeps longer lived animals in the game. But that doesn't mean longer live animal could have developed a competent immune system against bacteria without evolving many of the main components before they were long living.",

Why? How does it infect new hosts? Well, it\u2019s an unusual strategy, but the host animal is quickly killed by the infection but the active bacteria form inactive spores that are very carefully coated so that they last for dozens of years in the soil around the corpse. On reaching a friendly environment (say, the lungs of a grassland herbivore) they become active again and kill their host, repeating the cycle.

The downside to this is that there is not much diversity among posterity so they are all very uniformed compared to organisms that reproduce sexually.\n\nAnyway I think you\u2019re underestimating the human immune system honestly. My take is that the human immune system gets constant \u201ctraining\u201d to deal with exterior pathogens. Every time you eat, walk outside, touch something etc you are exposed to a certain number of pathogens which your body makes adjustments to and form antibodies. Microbiologists recommend foods like yoghurt for this reason. Cheese is also another microbe infested food that we safely consume and I\u2019m pretty sure if you bring a neanderthal here they will die eating cheddar cheese.\n\nThose exterior pathogens however don\u2019t have much \u201ctraining\u201d under harsh conditions to adapt like we do. Also not being able to sexually reproduce is a big hindrance towards adaptation. Their style is strength in numbers anyhow so it doesn\u2019t matter",

            "comment": "As well as de novo (new) mutations there are other mechanisms that can result in the new appearance of a genetic disease.\n\nHuntington disease is caused by a trinucleotide repeat expansion. In this case, the appearance of multiple repeats of CAG bases (&gt;40 I think) within the relevant gene, which impairs its function.\n\nPeople can be carriers of a trinucleotide repeat expansion disorder may have a premutation whereby they have more than the normal number of repeats but not enough to have any or at least not full symptoms of the disorder.\n\nWhen someone with a premutation has a child, they may pass on a copy of the gene with more repeats than they have. This is not random as de novo mutations are and could be the first appearance of a genetic disorder in a family.\n\nThe other condition you mention, Parkinson\u2019s disease seems to have a genetic link but not in the same way as monogenic conditions i.e. caused by a change in one gene. It seems as though there are multiple gene changes which may increase risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s but other factors, such as environment, may affect whether a person develops the condition.",

However, there are factors that either increase likelihood of mutations occuring, or decrease the likelihood of the organism recognizing and repairing them. Both *can* lead to permanent DNA damage (e.g. mutations), which then *can* cause an illness like the ones you listed earlier. This is also the way most cancers are caused.",

If your parents' environment wasn't conducive to developing obesity (or PKU symptoms) due to diet, they can pass on the gene to you without themselves having the trait. Then if your diet is different from theirs, you can express the trait.",

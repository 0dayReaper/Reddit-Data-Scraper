            "comment": "My understanding is that all terrestrial plants most likely evolved from green algae, which also uses chlorophylls a and c for photosynthesis. All other marine photosynthetic multicellular primary producers use a host of brown, red, blue and blue-green pigments for photosynthesis (fucoxanthin, carotenoids, phycocyanin, phycobilins, etc). I think it would be more accurate to say that chlorophyll pigments evolved from other, more primitive pigments found in older multicellular primary producers (rhodophyta, phaeophyta, chlorophyta).\n\nEdit: words",

Via the process of endosymbiosis this engulfed bacteria eventually became the plant organelle we call the chloroplast. Hence all land plants using the same basic pigment, and the wider variety of pigments used in other branches of the evolutionary tree",

The energy is shuttled to the special pair of chlorophyll molecules by resonance energy transfer.",

            "comment": "This is less of an earth science question and more of an economics / consumer psychology question (which as an earth scientist, I'm not going to be particularly able to answer). From a very basic level though, there are a lot of assumptions baked into this as a line of reasoning, e.g. that consumers (or most people in general) understand risk assessments, etc. The faulty (ha, pun not intended) line of reasoning could equally be applied to the continued existence / expansion of population centers in earthquake prone regions, e.g. 'If earthquakes are real, why haven't we seen a plummeting of real estate prices in Los Angeles as the time since the last major earthquake increases?'.  That being said, some quick browsing does suggest that there are the early signs of what you're describing (though none of these could be construed as a crash in real-estate prices at this point, more that there does appear to be a measurable influence of sea level rise on home prices), e.g. [Bernstein et al 2018](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3073842) showing that houses more in danger of sea level rise sold for 7% less than equivalent less risky homes or [Keenan et al 2018](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aabb32) showing a price premium being placed on homes at higher elevation in south Florida.",

The article utilizes Miami-Dade County, Florida (MDC) as a case study to explore the market mechanisms that speak to the operations and processes inherent in the theory. This article tests the hypothesis that the rate of price appreciation of single-family properties in MDC is positively related to and correlated with incremental measures of higher elevation (the 'Elevation Hypothesis'). As a reflection of an increase in observed nuisance flooding and relative SLR, the second hypothesis is that the rates of price appreciation in lowest the elevation cohorts have not kept up with the rates of appreciation of higher elevation cohorts since approximately 2000 (the 'Nuisance Hypothesis'). The findings support a validation of both hypotheses and suggest the potential existence of consumer preferences that are based, in part, on perceptions of flood risk and/or observations of flooding.",

You don't care if it floods. It's an acceptable risk to you because you're wealthy enough that no single disaster could possibly take everything from you.",

Doesn't matter to a billionaire but there are plenty of beach houses owned by people who are rich but not *that* rich. \n\nAlso consider that we aren't just talking literal beachfront property. In places like south Florida there are huge areas that are vulnerable to flooding which can be miles inland.",

The flood zone of the property, and it's relative risk, is priced into the premium. If you have one of those policies, your claim will not be denied on the basis of the location being known to be prone to flooding. That was the whole premise of the insurance. There was an underwriting process based on the physical location of the insured location.\n\nEven with beach-front real estate.\n\nAll of that said, the National Flood Insurance Program has a lot of problems and is arguably underfunded. \n\nPersonally, I favor a legislative change that would allow the federal flood program to have the option of settling a claim by buying the property at it's pre-loss value, so that over time the flood program can avoid paying off repeated total losses at the same location while simultaneously protecting coastal wetlands.\n\nSource: I was a wholesale insurance broker specializing in high-end personal lines for years before transitioning into my career as a science journalist.",

Some things are irreplaceable: mementos, photo albums, grandma's ashes. If you're not there in time\u2014and I wasn't\u2014these things are lost forever. Time is also a factor. It's no mean feat to purchase a new home, to relocate whatever remains of your material possessions, buy all the new kitchen equipment you spent a lifetime acquiring, and on and on. Wealth doesn't save you from having to supervise all these, even if you can contract everything else out.\n\nIt's a real dickshow. I do not recommend. It was such an enormous interruption that I sort of mentally separate my life between the antediluvian and the postdiluvian. Eight years on, I *still* find myself searching for certain items, only to realize I must have lost them in the flood.",

And as soon as it came into play,  people began to see what it would do, and all of a sudden, all hell  broke loose. The property owners, the politicians, the mayors all began  to object that these rates were going to drive people away from the  coast. So then the politicians in Washington, including the backers of  the original legislation, withdraw, and we end up passing new  legislation that slowed down rate increases and even reversed some of  the rate increases. And that's where we stand today.\n\nAccording to the piece, there is $3 trillion worth of property built in coastal areas potentially at risk and a federal insurance program that is effectively running at a perpetual loss with $0 of reserves insuring a good deal of that $3 trillion worth of property.\n\nCrazy stuff.",

Due to this flood insurance was not priced accordingly. \n\nThe flood and mass storms over the last decade has had the fed reducing how much they subsidize. Insurance that use to be a few thousand/year is now 9k+ if not more per a year. People are either going without flood insurance or abandoning their property. This is starting to lead to pricing declines as the TCO for owning in flood locations is becoming not worth it.",

It is also expensive and the coverage is a bit more restrictive. Your basement will not get any coverage at all, so have fun paying to pump out all the muck that collected in there and then repairing the damage left behind.",

All of these are fantastic examples of pricing mechanisms collapsing across an entire market.\n\nIn the 70s the CEOs of Exxon and Shell were both handed reports by their lead scientists saying climate change was real, man-made, and devastating.While it may not have figured into their business models because they'd die before it destroyed the world, subsequent CEOs should have had the foresight to recognize that nobody is going to buy gas when consumers are all dead.\n\nInstead of shifting their business model to renewable power they sunken cost fallacied their way into the possible extinction of humanity.  As a general rule of thumb it's a terrible idea to assume that a market set price is accurate when that market includes major externalities or is an established product that suddenly is growing substantially faster than GDP.",

If the damage is less than 50 percent of the building\u2019s market value immediately prior to the damage, you may be able to repair it at its original location.\n\nHowever, if the building is more than 50 percent damaged, repairs must meet the latest setback requirements, floodplain regulations and other building code requirements. Permits are required, as if it were new construction. In addition, repair or replacement on the lot would be prohibited if erosion has left insufficient space to meet the setback at that time.\n\nPurchasers should determine if the lot and building presently meet the setback for new construction and eligible for a replacement building, keeping in mind the risk that erosion may make the lot unbuildable in the future.\n\nThe brochure can be downloaded from: www.ncseagrant.org/s/real-estate.",

It was high elevation but it was near, literally, a drainage ditch. No actual bodies of water for miles. \n\nLooked at the mandatory flood insurance...  it was something along the lines of $500/month ($6000/year or so) for a very modest amount of insurance.\n\nHalf the living space, 2 bedrooms and 1 bathroom, were in the (very nice) finished basement. \n\nWe discovered that this super-expensive flood insurance does not cover any belongings in the basement, and will not refinish the basement (literally half the living space of the house) if it gets flooded. \n\nWe terminated the contract based on the cost and terms of insurance. We realized that if we get a bad storm and the house floods, we lose half our house with no recourse. Just insane.\n\nYSK flood insurance premiums and terms are set in stone by FEMA. Do NOT buy a house with a finished basement in a flood zone. Your basement and any personal belongings in the basement (beds, clothes, kids' toys, TVs, furniture, etc.) will not be insured, despite the fact you'll be paying out your rear end for insurance.",

State and even city level governments are subsiding coastal homes in another way. \n\nBeach replenishment. As climate change moves forward and average temperatures rise we see an increase in the overall frequency and power of storms. Most beaches are not naturally sandy, most are rocky. Costal cities and towns all over the US bring in sand to make the beaches more tourist friendly. However these wide artificial beaches also make for pretty good erosion protection, allowing beach homes over the last 100 year or so to be built much closer than they were historically. \n\n Now with storms being more powerful and frequent they wash away the sand (not natural to the area) faster exposing the houses to erosion risk and the towns to decreased tourism revenue. The towns cities and states then bring in sand to replace the lost beach. The cycle will continue until the cost is to great to replenish the beach, at that point prices will start to tank.\n\n\nPeople are very bad at planning for the future and acting proactively. Usually things need to start falling apart before anyone actually reacts. We are seeing this with climate change now (we've known about it since the start of the industrial revolution) and we will see it with beach properties in the future.

For example, with regard to E coast flood zones (where property losses are influenced by interannual variability of sea level, as well as storm surge, vertical land motion, and global mean sea level rise), the insurance is heavily subsidized by the Fed's. He felt that the property and risk markets are so far out of equilibrium that it would be unwise to place bets on sea level rise impacts, yet. By simply extrapolating the mean sea level rise and predictable ocean tides, you could quite reliably predict \"sunny day\" flood events in Annapolis, Md, and you could probably make a reasonably accurate prediction of the added economic costs related to this kind of flooding, but to make money off of this you would be betting against an opponent with effectively infinite resources to mitigate short-term losses.\n\nInvestors with sufficient resources are likely placing long-term bets, but they probably won't pay off for another 20 to 50 yrs. The current rate of mean sea level rise is about 1.5 inches/decade. It is not much, but it has been leading to observable impacts especially in places where land subsidence is also occurring. Some effects, such as the intrusion of salt water into the local water table, are not visible and might not effect property values short term, but are certainly going to lead to major changes in land use.",

Eustatic sea level rise is just the physical \"more water equals higher seas\" way of looking at it. The continents behave like buoyant objects. This buoyancy - \"Isostacy\" - is the effect you will see when ice melts. It's when a part of earth's crust rises due to less of a load on it from, in this case, ice. So you'll see some areas that are still isostatically rebounding from the last ice age rising, while others are inundated with water from eustacy. This is just to explain part of the misconception of how sea level rises (tectonics and local effects also play a part).\n\nNow when it comes to why real-estate prices aren't drastically decreasing... I'm not sure that they aren't. We have systems of levees that keep some areas dry that shouldn't be. But there are places where a single storm event completely leveled a town and took real estate prices from *something* to non-existent (because there was no land to sell). Louisiana especially comes to mind here, as do properties on the Outer Banks, and even River properties on the lower Susquehanna.",

            "comment": "It boils down to this: humans are really bad at anticipating novel threats.  \n\n\nWe've been through enough hurricanes to know what a hurricane warning means, at least in Florida. But a friend of mine in Massachussets a year or two ago shrugged off theirs with \"dude, people are literally outside doing yardwork\".   \n\n\nFortunately for them, that storm went out to sea (I think it was Ivan) leaving them with just a little rain, but it could have been a disaster not unlike Sandy had been in New York/Jersey.  \n\n\nIn the Bible we have the parable of the man who built on stone compared to the man who built on sand-- the sand man was washed away when the floods came down.  \n\n\nTake a tourist who sees a cute (but dangerous) animal for the first time and tries to do a cuddle-selfie despite warnings from their native guide.  \n\n\nThere is a saying \"Once bitten, twice shy\" which is great when the thing biting you is only an annoyance; unfortunately, climate change won't be just an annoyance, it will result in fundamental change with a life-changing price tag. And unfortunately, price-tag is not a factor for these sort of novel threats like Mt. St. Helens blowing up (people refused to leave, for example) or rattlesnake bites (hold my beer) or climate change (my property is mine).  \n\n\nWe even see examples where I live in Colorado. We've had a rash of bear encounters this last year, and the victim's response is sometimes \"I built my house here, why are they on my property?\". Well, for one, bears mark property by scratching and peeing, not by drawing lines on a map with dollar signs. And two, you left your trash out and the bear found out-- what did you think was going to happen? And yet they insist that this is theirs and seem to be legitimately confused as to why the bear doesn't recognize that. (Some do recognize it, but a surprising number do not-- much to my amazement). Anyway, same thing with climate change. In their mind, the human went through all the right steps to earn money and purchase the property, and the weather will somehow (magically) understand and respect that.  \n\n\nAs a last example I am reminded of King Canut, yes, he is real. Apparently some of his supporters/advisers saw kings as all powerful, so he had them take him to the coast where he tried to stop the tide from changing. There is no record of whether or not his knuckleheaded followers got the message.",

            "comment": "Several reasons:\n\n1) A sea-level rise of 3-5cm per decade isn't significant to most property values. That can be mitigated by pretty-standard property maintenance. Generally speaking, anyone who buys coastal property as a long-term investment is prepared to maintain it to this level.\n\n2) Property-market prices are heavily influenced by units which turn over quickly. These tend to be higher-priced properties, since people are less inclined to sell properties whose prices are stagnant or falling. \n\n3) The primary risk from sea-level rise isn't the level of the sea, but storm surge. This risk is pretty unpredictable, but coastal areas are generally skilled at mitigating it \u2014 for instance, by spreading the risk among many people through property insurance.\n\n4) Most individuals' longest-term horizon for property-owning is a generation or two. Forty years would be a very long horizon. Climate effects just aren't strong enough to reliably affect prices in this term. \n\n5) The main influence on property prices is demand, since as is famously said about real estate: They ain't making any more of it. So as long as a region's population and wealth continue to rise, its property prices will rise. And they will probably rise faster than average at the coast, as long as people tend to value coastal property over inland property.\n\nCalling climate change \"a serious threat\" is kind of like calling an extinction-level asteroid impact or alien invasion \"a serious threat.\" The resulting impacts are devastating, but if you approach the problem rationally then you also have to estimate your likelihood of encountering those devastating impacts \u2014 and that usually comes down to your assumptions about the time frame involved. Over the course of a billion years, an extinction-level asteroid's *approach* toward Earth is pretty likely. But in your lifetime, the actual impacts you'll see are likely to be minimal.\n\nAnd the same is probably true for climate change. I doubt you'll see large numbers of people selling coastal property for cents on the dollar in your lifetime. I often tell people that if anyone feels climate-spooked enough to panic-sell at that level now, they should give me a call. But nobody ever does. I guess there is some climate panic out there, but the rationality of the property market remains basically undisturbed for now.\n\nEdit: typo",

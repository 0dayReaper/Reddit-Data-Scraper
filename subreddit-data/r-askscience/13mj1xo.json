    "postText": "Let's say you have food with a certain flavor like salty.\nThe salty flavour is what taste buds will pick up. Now let's say you add something to that food, something bitter. Does the bitter flavour take up some slots on the taste buds making the salty flavour less prominent? Is that how tasting works? I honestly have no idea",

            "comment": "There are different types of receptors within your taste buds that will react when they come into contact with different things. The exact details of which receptors are responsible for what, and how they get triggered seems to be an ongoing field of research, but on the level of perception, we are generally looking at 5 component flavors, sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and umami. These affect different receptors in the taste buds, which send different neural sensory information up to the brain. Spiciness is perceived through pain receptors that are largely separate from the standard flavor receptors. (I think, its been a while since I took the relevant class on this.\n\nSo in your example, if you have a salty flavor, the salty food is going to bind to the salt receptors. And if you have bitter flavor, the bitter component will bind to bitter receptors. And if you have both, each flavor gets picked up by it's relevant receptors. They aren't really competing with each other for receptors if the flavors are blended well. However, if you have a bitter leaf in salad that physically obstructs a number of your taste buds and therefor receptors, that would have a substantial influence on flavor, but it wouldn't be because bitter receptors are taking over the sweet, salty, sour, and umami receptors, its because the other parts of the food aren't physically reaching the taste buds.",

            "comment": "The way a food tastes, or its overall flavor, is a combination of taste and aroma. \n\nTaste is what your mouth and tongue can perceive, while aroma is perceived by the olfactory system (nose), either directly through smelling or through \"retronasal aroma\" meaning aroma of food that's in your mouth.\n\nYour tongue has distinct taste buds for different tastes - sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami - but they are distributed throughout the tongue, not in specific regions as is sometimes depicted.\n\nWhile they are sensed by different receptors, there are interactions between the different tastes in terms of how they are perceived. Sweetness decreases bitter perception, and sourness increases saltiness perception, for example.\n\nThere are also other sensations your mouth and tongue can sense that aren't considered \"tastes,\" such as spiciness, astringency, and cooling (like menthol).\n\nNot to mention texture and mouthfeel, which are more about how the food physically feels in your mouth and as you chew.\n\nSensory science is an entire field dedicated to the study of food perception.",

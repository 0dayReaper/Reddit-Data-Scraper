    "postText": "I understand that these comparisons are metaphorical since the brain and computers work very differently. However, I'm curious to know how much \"memory\" our brains would hold if we were to estimate it in terms understandable to us in the tech world (like GBs or TBs). Similarly, what would the equivalent \"RAM\" be, based on our ability to simultaneously process information?\n\nThank you!",

If we wanted to represent the connection network in a computer, maybe for each synapse we could use 32 bits to remember which neuron it's connecting too and another 32 bits for the connection strength, which would take 800 TB - 8000 TB in total?",

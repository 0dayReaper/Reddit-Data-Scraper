Nevertheless I have also read an article, which says that this statement is a myth (https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/brain-development-25-year-old-mature-myth.html). What\u2019s your opinion on that topic? And if it\u2019s true that the brain has not finished development until 25, how does a fully developed brain differ from a say 18 year old brain?",

That's when you have the biggest volume of gray and white matter combined in your cerebrum (not including cerebellum and brainstem, but those are a lot smaller too).\n\nWhite matter volume is maximum at 29 years. \n\nWhether the change from gray matter to white matter is always development and positive or sometime aging and negative is unknown yet. It's likely that as we age we lose some of our ability to learn by losing synapses but we are better at having more complex thoughts. \n\nThe change from gray matter to white matter happens due to synapses dying and being replaced by longer connexion. Since synapses are where the computation happens, it makes that the brain gets less powerful after 6 years old in a computer sense, however the system is more fine tuned since the synapses have been optimized and it allows for more complex thought since different parts of the brain are more connected.\n\nhttps://sharpbrains.com/blog/2022/04/26/collaborative-neuroimaging-initiative-brainchart-helps-chart-how-brains-change-across-the-lifespan\n\nFrom 18 to 25, your brain size slightly decreases, your white matter slightly increases, and your gray master slightly decreases. Gray matter decreases mostly by the lost of synapses, it's then partially replaced by longer axons (white matter) and partially replaced by holes filled by fluid (ventricules). The loss of synapses is likely due to your brain fine-tuning itself, but it can also be due to aging that causes the synapses to stop working even if they were useful.",

            "comment": "This is a classic case of some studies being simplified into pop science. It is true that our brains are changing during childhood and adolescence, and that this change *generally* slows as we progress through our 20's, but **there is nothing special about the age 25**. We continue 'maturing' throughout our life which is reflected by continued change in our brain architecture.\n\nFrom [Somerville et al](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(16)30809-1.pdf):\n\n\"\\[There is a\\] need to abandon the goal of identifying a single age-of-brain maturity. Rather, there would be a suite of maturity points that reflect different neural systems and differentassociated behaviors. For example, an individual could reach an age of \u2018\u2018baseline cognitive maturity\u2019\u2019\u2014the capacity to engage in goal-directed behavior under neutral, non-distractedcircumstances, substantially earlier than an age of \u2018\u2018cognitive emotional maturity\u2019\u2019\u2014the capacity to maintain goal-directed behavior in the face of competing emotional cues.\"\n\nThere is some truth that some development finishes in our 20's but that's not the whole story. We are continuously changing and developing as we acquire new experiences throughout our life. Importantly, we can make generalizations about what we observe from people from certain age groups (IE 18 vs 25 y/o) but these generalizations can't be applied to individuals. In fact, in one study found age was only responsible for 55% of differences in individuals' brain scans.\n\nPerspective on brain development and maturation - [https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(16)30809-1.pdf](https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(16)30809-1.pdf)\n\nPerformance on random item generation tasks peaks at 25 - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28406953/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28406953/)\n\nOpenness decreases as we age - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16435954/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16435954/)\n\nPredicting age by MRI - [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20829489/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20829489/)",

            "comment": "South east Virginia experience.\n\nPlenty of flow starting in Feb.  Kicks into high gear March through June-ish.  Harvest the supers the last week in June.  Dearth mid June through the end of August very little nectar to be found.  Watch out for robbing.  \n\nFall flow starts back in in Sept through Mid Nov.  I also tend to feed sugar water at that time so that they can build up winter stores.  Over the winter any day that it is above 50 they will go out and come back with pollen.  I also tend to feed sugar water in the winter if they will take it, stopping when the top of the maple trees start to get red buds and I put the supers back on.",

            "comment": "It seems like your question is focused on pollen but also asks about food levels generally.\n\nI can give some information relevant to N/S Calif and the desert SW (Sonoran desert specifically).\n\nPollen and nectar are both gathered by workers when available and to match the needs of the hive. When the queen is laying eggs, they hatch after ~3 days and the brood (looks like small white worms) are fed pollen and also nectar/honey. Pollen is usually stored around the edges of the brood nest and isn't needed in huge amounts - just enough to feed the brood. Nectar, however, is stored up in large amounts and dried into honey, then capped. This dried nectar (honey) is the main food larder for the hive.  These food reserves are used to get the bees through mid summer dearth and then through the winter.\n\nIn general, food levels are lower at the end of winter and high at the end of the spring flow.  This year SoCal is having a pretty unprecedented honey flow due to cooler temperatures and wetter conditions.",

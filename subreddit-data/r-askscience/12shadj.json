So it shouldn't be too surprising to find [some shared structure and function between the two groups](https://frontiersinzoology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1742-9994-6-11), even though both modern echidnoderms and modern chordates are quite derived relative to whatever ancestor they once shared \\~600 million years ago.",

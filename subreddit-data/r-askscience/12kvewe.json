Efficient as in money efficient.\n\nThe equipment it takes to produce grams right now cost in the range of several hundred Ks. We don't expect equipment prices to come down immediately, but perhaps in the next few years. The challenge is to produce kilograms in bigger equipment and then eventually tonnes.\n\nGrowing fat cells or muscle cells or stomach cells or intestine cells is just a matter of choosing which part of the original animal to biopsy from, and tweaking ingredients to suit what those cells like.\n\nI don't know if any of our competitors are using stem cells, but we certainly aren't. The complexity involved in differentiating them correctly is not worth the time, plus we can't say if the specimen is healthy by using stem cells.",

But i think one of our competitors will reach there by about 2028 (though our 'competitor' is not really a competitor as they are growing chicken and we're growing something else). Give or take +/-2 years, as you never know...\n\nPrice matching wise, maybe a few more years after 2030.\n\nThe first steps, which is already happening, involve tasting menus at like specialty events and such. If you get an opportunity to try alt meats these events, go for it, because whatever you eat there is million dollars worth of R&amp;D to produce only grams.\n\n\nAlso, we avoid calling them 'lab grown' meats, and refer to them as alternative meats or cell cultured meats. The eventual product will not be 'lab' grown but rather 'factory' grown.",

I'm sure that'll eventually lead to budget options that strip away the extras, or options that favor flavor over nutrition.

Kidney stones average every 4 to 8 months now depending on how much I end up drinking at work and a few dietary factors, but my diet didn't change dramatically other than the water change aside from mostly cutting out peanuts and reducing my already low intake of pop. \n\nBelieve me, a LOT of tap water has more in it than you would think.",

It relates to the nature of its production, but also lends it an air of prestige.\n\nAlso, one of the things I appreciate about cultured meat is that not only does it take the slaughter out of meat production, but it could potentially enable the production of meat products that are largely considered cruel. Stuff like veal, foie gras, maybe even ortolans if we wanna get spicy.\n\nWith foie gras specifically, I'm pretty sure there's a Parisian company that's been developing cultured foie gras without requiring a whole goose. I think their name is Gourmey? And as for veal, with how cultured meat is grown, one could probably grow cultured veal using samples from calves, thus reducing the cruelty of veal production by orders of magnitude, since in theory the cruellest part of the cultured process would be taking ultimately-harmless tissue samples.",

Or, on the more bizarre side, cultured human meat would almost certain have a market even if just for the sort of ghoulish novelty of it.\n\nWhen all you need is a tissue sample, it seems to open up a very wide range of options, so I was wondering why all the focus seems to be purely on replicating what we are already making now rather than offering something that is otherwise completely unavailable. \n\nIt seems like a reasonable way to get over that initial cost hurdle in ramping up production. A lot of people won't be interested in paying extra for cultured meat just on principle who would pay a premium if it offered them an experience they could not otherwise obtain.",

As the cultured meat market matures, there should be more production of these non animal versions that will bring down the price further.",

Even if some countries introduce regulations, others might not. Thus, some companies in highly regulated regions might be able to produce meat cultures safely, but worldwide damage can still be caused by those companies acting in regions with less regulation.",

Animal fats tend to be solid at room temp and plant fats tend to be liquid.  This means they have vastly different physical properties, and as such vastly different culinary properties.  You could probably make it taste like butter, but not really and it will have a weird after taste.  And it will never act like butter.  This is of course unless you modify the fats themselves, for example adding the extra hydrogen atoms that the unsaturated vegetable fats don't have, trying to turn them into saturated fats.  Which we have done.  They're called trans fats.  And they're very not good for you, but they turn vegetable fats into fats that taste like animal fats.",

Saturated fats have no double bonds in the molecule, being \u2018saturated\u2019 with hydrogens. The hydrogens repulse the chemicals that would normally break up the fatty chain (by reacting at a double bond). Unsaturated fats have double or triple bonds. Trans fats are a mostly man made fat, where you take something that had a triple bond and add hydrogen, and the hydrogens align as far from each other as they can get (trans position instead of cis). This has same effect of blocking body from being able to break it down AND preventing heat from breaking it down.\n\nMargarine typically has both saturated and trans fats, depending on how it\u2019s made. Animal based will usually have more saturated fats, plant based more trans fat. Neither are good for you.  Coconut oil has not been proven to have any health properties and is viewed negatively for heart health:  https://www.mayoclinic.org/dont-get-tricked-by-these-3-heart-health-myths/art-20390070",

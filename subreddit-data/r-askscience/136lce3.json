    "postText": "Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science**\n\nDo you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: \"What would happen if...\", \"How will the future...\", \"If all the rules for 'X' were different...\", \"Why does my...\".\n\n**Asking Questions:**\n\nPlease post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.\n\n**Answering Questions:**\n\nPlease only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.\n\nIf you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).\n\nPast AskAnythingWednesday posts [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27meta%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). Ask away!",

Like if you pump cold air upwards it should cool the air and sink, but isn't efficiency lost in the cold air heating up and just meeting in the middle? If you pump the warm air down with the assistance of gravity it should mix with the cold air at the bottom and cause positive pressure to push the cold air upwards, right?",

                    "comment": "Gasses like air expand when heated, which is why hot air rises: it is less dense than colder air.  For heating a house, adding the warm air at the floor level uses this buoyancy to help the air disburse throughout the space.  Adding cold air at the floor level for air conditioning is less efficient this way, but the temperatures within the space will still even out over time.  Either way, unless you are looking at a structure larger than an average 3-bed-2-bath home, the heating unit and the air compressor themselves will be the largest sources of inefficiency, while leaky or old windows are the largest sources of energy loss.",

There is also no other liquid that has a similarly low price and all the other nice features of water. Making a canal would be prohibitively expensive.",

            "comment": "So this is not my area of expertise and I hope other more qualified people chime in but I have found some informations (some of it even peer reviewed!). \n\n[This article [1]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00484-011-0515-5) talks about how four legged animals are more vulnerable to lightning strikes because ground current has high chances to go through vital organs. It also describes how large animals such as giraffes and elephants have higher chances of deadly strikes. There is the obvious thing about the fact that they are tall so even under a tree there is a non-negligeable chance that lighting could [jump directly to their head](http://i.imgur.com/iYzL85H.png). The other less obvious one is that even if they are not directly hit, the large distance their legs span increased the voltage (and potentially the current) going though them (as described in[ this figure](http://i.imgur.com/JkPWM1K.png)). Sadly the article lacks hard numbers on strike frequency depending on the species. \n\nThis [blog post](http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2009/07/15/mammal-deaths-by-lightning/) seems to suggest that giraffes getting killed by lightning is not that uncommon. \n\n&gt; Between 1996 and 1999 the Rhino and Lion Reserve near Krugersdorp, South Africa, had two of its three giraffes killed by lightning \u2013 the third animal (a juvenile) was also struck but survived. Betsy the giraffe was killed by lightning at Walt Disney World in Florida in 2003 (in front of lots of witnesses).\n\n...\n\n&gt;  A juvenile giraffe at Louisiana\u2019s Global Wildlife Center, named Dusty, was killed after lightning struck a nearby tree. \n\n[1] Gomes, Chandima. \"Lightning safety of animals.\" International journal of biometeorology 56.6 (2012): 1011-1023.",

Obviously rabbits are pretty small but I could see kangaroos being likely strike vectors. I doubt they are very active during a lightning storm though.",

Lack of trees and the relatively high chance of sudden severe weather at any given time  meant that we were drilled in elementary on things like tornado safety and lightning avoidance. How to detect when you were building a positive charge, ways to try to break the circuit if you can't get under shelter in time. How to recognize a dangerous day by the weather and humidity well before clouds began to form. Things like that. This was before convective prediction maps and Doppler technologies had gotten as good as they are now thanks to computers.\n\nI joke all the time with my east coast coworkers that people who grew up in the Great Plains should get a Bachelors in Meteorology just as a de facto thing.",

You generally have to prove that it was valuable experience, though.  If you only lived there a few years, I'm not sure you could get more than a vocational certificate.  The first 18 years of your life might be worth somewhere between an associate's and a bachelor's.  First 18 plus college would probably put you toward the bachelor's end of things.  A lifer in the plains that's around 40-50 is probably qualified to teach the more advanced meteorology graduate courses.  Particularly if you've spent that whole time working on a farm, or in some other outdoor activity that requires you to be intimately familiar with the weather.",

The effective population size for non-African humans has historically been ~1e4, but with recent rapid population growth has risen over the past ~100 generations to something like 1e7. This would suggest that at these rates lightning avoidance could not have been selected for in the past, isn't being selected for now, but could be in the near future.",

I live a few kilometers from the lion park mentioned and it has a very high strike rate because of the terrain layout and elevation. Johannesburg has one of the highest lightning strike rates in the world generally.",

The reason for this is that the earth has a very high resistance to electricity traveling through it, this causes an effect such that the further you are from the source of the electricity the lower the voltage will be. The danger associated with that is if you are in contact with a point of low voltage and a point of high voltage, your body will be a path of less resistance than compared to traveling through the ground. The result is if you were to stand near a source of electricity that was energizing the earth and your feet are spread apart, you increase your risk of the electricity flowing through your body. ",

The animal's body acts as a conductor for those last few feet. What actually makes getting struck by lightning more rare is that the geographic footprint of a giraffe is very tiny so the odds of being struck go from extremely low to a itty bitty tiny bit higher. However, if we know that lightning will likely strike the ground within 10 feet of each animal, the odds of the giraffe being affected are much higher than that of the zebra.",

Giraffes may actually seek shelter in forested areas during a thunderstorm, lessening their risk for a strike. \n\nI would theorize that either birds (shockwaves from strikes) or tree dwelling animals would actually be the highest risk of lightning fatalities.

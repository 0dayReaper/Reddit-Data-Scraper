            "comment": "If you have N identical particles described by a wavefunction and exchange two particles in it, what happens? The physics has to stay the same - they are identical, after all. And if you swap them again then you need to get the original wavefunction back. That leads to two options:\n\n* The wavefunction stays the same. We have bosons.\n* The wavefunction is multiplied by -1. We have fermions.\n\nIn the first case there is no problem with multiple particles in the same state. Swapping them doesn't change the wavefunction so you have the same system as before. But what happens if you swap two particles in identical states in the second case? You conclude that the wavefunction is identical to its inverse, which only works if it's zero overall: The state cannot exist. Extending that to thermodynamics we get the Bose-Einstein statistics for bosons and the Fermi-Dirac statistics for fermions.\n\nThe [spin-statistics theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin%E2%80%93statistics_theorem) tells us that bosons have an integer spin while fermions have a half-integer spin in our world but that's not as fundamental as the statistics we get.",

This rules out exactly identical states between pairs of particles. Yet there also is a pressure (quantum degeneracy pressure) that emerges as density of matter increases, and this pressure counteracts the compression due to gravity found in objects like neutron stars. Does this mean that similar, but non-identical, states between pairs of fermions are also not allowed (or are \"discouraged\")? Do we know *how* the exclusion principle becomes this pressure? \n\nAlso, once the density exceeds a certain level, the Pauli exclusion principle cannot compete against gravity and an object collapses to become a black hole. This, to me, seems like a violation of the non-exchangeability of fermions in the quantum wavefunction that you describe. Is this one of those \"black holes break what we know about physics\" moments? Do we have an idea how it is possible that this happens?",

A common example is an atom where you have two states for n=1, 8 for n=2 and so on. There is no state in between these energies for electrons. The gaps between energy levels tend to be larger if your system is smaller: Squeezing the matter means increasing the energy of all the electrons in the states that now get a higher energy.\n\nIf a neutron star has sufficient mass then gravity provides enough energy to squeeze it down further against this neutron degeneracy pressure - it collapses.\n\nOnce you have a black hole, electron or neutron energy levels don't matter at all because trying to escape (or trying to stay stationary) inside a black hole is like trying to reach last Friday. There isn't even a direction you could be pushed to in order to achieve that.",

On the one hand, there's no way for fermions to have the same state. On the other hand, there's no way backward in time. Why does the black hole logical impossibility have precedence over the Pauli-principle logical impossibility?",

This arises from the antisymmetry of the wave function representing fermions.  \n\\- Bosons have integer spins. They  do not adhere to the Pauli Exclusion Principle. The wave function that describes a system of identical bosons is symmetric, allowing them to occupy the same state in the same place.  This symmetry means that if you swapped two bosons in the system, the wave function would remain unchanged. This symmetry allows multiple bosons to occupy the same quantum state, even within the same space, leading to phenomena like Bose-Einstein condensates",

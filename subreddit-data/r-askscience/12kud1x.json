    "postText": "I couldnt find any specifics on environmental dangers of landfills other than methane emissions and leachate secretion, which, for the most part, are being sanitized with the majority of landfills. Do landfills contribute to the locations pollution? Do they effect the fauna and flora around them, and do they have any effects on water cycles?  \nAlso, why are people so opposed to Waste to Energy plants when they are not only an alternative solution to landfills, but also a means to produce energy?",

There have been cases where houses around landfills blow up due to methane accumulations in basements. \n\nLeachate can be a problem, especially with bioreactor type landfills that encourage organic waste decay. And leachate is a weird substance that has all kinds of constituents. And if leachate finds the right geology it can travel underground. \n\nTraffic in and around landfills can result in dust problems. Silica exposire and such. \n\nThere is also biological hazard. Landfills often take sewage treatment sludge and slaughter house or roadkill waste. They can be a disease vector. \n\nOne of the larger set of potential problems is in landfills that close (stop taking waste). Over time plastic liners break down, waste settles and compresses differentially. Slope failures, liner failures and cap failures can happen. Waste gets exposed to the surface and/or groundwater. And since nobody is making money from disposal, nobody is paying as much attention. \n\nPests are sometimes a problem. Seagulls, rats, racoons, insects.  Landfill engineers have to consider  airport locations because of bird strike issues for instance. \n\nOn a smaller scale, there are localized issues with climate and wind patterns and such. \n\nBlown debris is also a thing. Lighter stuff like paper, foam insulation, styrofoam packing material etc can get caught in the wind and go anywhere.",

So pretty much every landfill closure permit I've worked on has had a condition that tires are removed for off-site disposal when encountered. One regulator told me that the reason is they \"float to the top\" over time and end up pushing up on the cap. But no one I've asked (from regulators to my colleagues) has had any clue how that actually works. Like, there's an impermeable cap so it couldn't be frost heaving or some weird capillary action phenomenon, right? So what else would push tires up in the waste mass in the absence of water?",

The tires bounce up / dig up slowly as the tire is compressed, traps air to expand, fills the gap, gets compressed again, repeat.\n\nIt's like a digging machine that takes soil from in front and pushes it behind itself.\n\nMovement is roughly upwards at a rate of 1 m every 5 years.",

They can also conversely acting as a drain when established in sediments of lower hydraulic conductivity near the surface, but with more conductive sediments below, as the landfill 'punches a hole' through the overlying sediments.\n\nLandfills can also lead to land subsidence, which can affect the natural flow of groundwater and cause contamination. Not to mention landfills can also cause soil erosion, which can lead to sedimentation in nearby water bodies, affecting both water quality and quantity.\n\nLandfill site management is a huge issue in my industry as it can become very complex very quickly with things like subterranean structures etc. \n\nSource - Am a hydrogeologist",

I don\u2019t have a scientific answer for you if the cautious people are correct. The issue with CO2 emissions is that the landfill works as carbon storage so now you are putting that carbon into the atmosphere, but it is a much more complicated answer since some of the waste in the landfill naturally decomposes into methane and then CO2 which also pollute the atmosphere.",

Also, the plant would be using the power it generates to sustain itself, so not much of a sustaining cost there. But thats an interesting point you make on byproducts.",

I think they just flattened it then covered it with earth before the built the houses.  About ten or so years ago random bits of garbage started 'flowing' to the surface.  I don't know how this works- my best guess is material decomposes, masses shift and stuff gets pushed around.  I think some of the houses now have significant foundation problems.",

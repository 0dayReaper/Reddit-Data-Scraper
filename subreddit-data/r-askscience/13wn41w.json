    "postText": "Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science**\n\nDo you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: \"What would happen if...\", \"How will the future...\", \"If all the rules for 'X' were different...\", \"Why does my...\".\n\n**Asking Questions:**\n\nPlease post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.\n\n**Answering Questions:**\n\nPlease only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.\n\nIf you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).\n\nPast AskAnythingWednesday posts [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27meta%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all). Ask away!",

Would this have some sort of real-world impact? Would it vary based on how approximate the rounding off was?",

                    "comment": "It depends on your application.\n\nWhen you round pi to 3.14, you are (approx.) 0.5% off from the correct value. Therefore, if you are computing the circumference of an object of a known diameter, your calculation will be at least 0.5% inaccurate. If you are trying to compute the material needed to fence your giant circular dungeon, you may be millimeters off - the extra cost to purchase more material to accommodate that is probably somewhat acceptable to someone who already owns a giant circular dungeon.\n\nIf, instead, you are working on NASA's Station Guidance Navigation and Control or their Space Integrated Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation System, the calculations your code is performing [need 14 to 16 decimal digits](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/how-much-pi-do-you-need/). In cases like this, introducing inaccuracy means you can no longer navigate as accurately, or communicate with a remote system at all.\n\nIt can be envisaged you [may need more](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2016/3/16/how-many-decimals-of-pi-do-we-really-need).",

What if the relationship between a circle's circumference and its radius was exactly 3.14? Or any other irrational numbers. What if the continuous rate of growth was exactly 2.718 instead of an irrational number. Would such a change to fundamental relationships affect the universe in any way?",

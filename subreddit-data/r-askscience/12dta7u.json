If they are certain to have the right answer then no one else needs to work on that question, if they are unsure then send it to others. That way we have teams, they have more time per question, and we can give difficult problems to many people in the hope that someone finds the right answer.",

You may know 5 things that I don't, and I may know 5 things you don't, so if we combine the two, it would stack and outscore a single person who knows 8 things.\n\nSome of the exercises they won't be able to improve on as a group, e.g. speed based exercises. It doesn't really matter how many people are trying to do it, it's like running, the fastest one wins, you don't get faster because you run with a bigger group (ignoring drafting and such). So you can't increase the score as a group on those types of exercises, and the result will basically depend on the person in the group with the highest IQ.\n\nWhich depends on the size of the group. If you pick any size group, I would expect the average IQ of the group to be 100. Some individuals will be higher IQ, some lower. So the max IQ score will depend on the size of the group. If you pick 2 random people, chances are that their IQs will be close to 100. Statistically, a 130 IQ (SD15) occurs once in every 50 people. So if you have 50 random people in the group, statistically, one should have a 130 IQ. They should be able to achieve the same score on the 2nd type of exercises as the 130 individual against which you're comparing the group.\n\nSo I think it depends on the size of the group. If the group is of size 1 or 2, it would be unlikely that they will do as well as or better than a 130 IQ individual. But the bigger the group gets, the more the advantages on both types of exercises will add up. If you have a group of 30,000 people, you're bound to have a few individuals with much higher IQ than 130, and they would probably score higher than the 130 individual on most if not all exercises, and so the rest of the group doesn't even have to participate.\n\nIn a group of 20 people, I would expect there to be one person with an IQ of about 125. Would they, together with the other people, be able to outperform the 130? I don't know, but I expect that given all the above, they'd get close at least.\n\nIt would be interesting to have a statistician work out the odds for a given size group.",

You only get so much time to solve them. (E.g. solve a series of patterns that get progressively more difficult/complex, see how far you get before time runs out.) In those exercises, speed matters. You'd expect a high IQ person to be able to do it faster than a lower IQ person.\n\n&gt;There is no test where someone with a score of 130 would find all correct answers in the given time and someone with a score of 120 wouldn't find any.\n\nOf course not. But it's more likely that a 130 IQ person would get further/get more correct than a 120 IQ person before time runs out. \n\nNow, if your point is that if you put a 120 and a 130 together to solve, and sometimes the 120 may solve one of the single patterns faster than the 130 would, and so together they'd get further, then you may have a point.",

That way both have twice the time per problem. If they cannot find an answer in a reasonable time, maybe let the other person have a look at it later.\n\nWith a group of 20 you get even more time per problem.",

As you can probably tell by looking at politics, it often isn't really the best idea that wins out in a discussion. Normally whoever is most relatable, assertive, or confident about their idea will win out, which may have no correlation to how true the answer is. I actually had to discipline a guy at work recently for disseminating false information. The guy is young, charismatic, very (perhaps overly) confident, and frankly..pretty likable on a personal level. Rather than asking questions about things, he would just kind of assert the first thing that came to mind very confidently. He would often straight up give false information about our policy or about regulations, but the way in which he would do it was causing people to not question him too much. I had to give him a stern talking to about the importance of providing true information and being honest about when you don't know something. I do see that he's making an effort to improve it thankfully.",

            "comment": "The short answer is the end of the last glacial period is a bit unique within the Pleistocene (where the end of the last glacial period also represented the end of the Pleistocene) with respect to extinctions, i.e., most prior glacial-interglacial cycles (at either end, i.e., going from glacial to interglacial or interglacial to glacial) did not result in an extinction. It was in part this observation, i.e., that the extinction at the end of the Pleistocene killed off a variety of megafauna that had survived various glacial-interglacial cycles throughout the Pleistocene, led to the development of the \"overkill\" hypothesis, i.e., that since these megafauna had lived through prior glacial-interglacial cycles, a climatic trigger for the extinction was unlikely and that the coincidence of this with the spread of human populations might be related (e.g., [Steadman et al., 2005](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.0502777102)). \n\nHowever, there are a variety of issues with the overkill hypothesis and more broadly it wasn't just megafauna that went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene (e.g., [Jackson &amp; Weng, 1999](https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.96.24.13847)), no two glacial-interglacial cycles are exactly the same (e.g., [Meltzer, 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2015032117)), and relatedly the way individual species respond via range shift etc. to climatic triggers varies and can either go well or badly (e.g., [Lister &amp; Stuart, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1631071308000928)). Thus, generally while not a coherent consensus exists as yet, there is likely sort of a unique set of factors (both climatic and other) that led to the particular glacial-interglacial transition to become an extinction event.",

                    "comment": "This is mostly correct but want to add some nuance: The end of the last glacial is assumed to be unique, but that's largely because most research has focused on the last ice age. In part this is due to remains from earlier time points being more abundant, and in part this is because glacial-interglacial cycles also destroy a lot of remains as they rip through the geology.\n\nThere is good evidence this is not the case. There was a talk by someone I saw at INQUA 2019 that argued this was not necessarily true and there are species that go extinct (or begin the extinction process) in Europe ~75-50 kya, which corresponds to the onset of the last glacial. \n\nLikewise it's hard to say whether it was the glacial itself that was particularly unique or the combined glacial/interglacial transition and ecosystem restructuring with increasing human populations and subsequent predation/habitat modification. \n\nOP here's how I would think about:\n\nThe glacial/interglacial transition is a period of immense climatic and ecological upheveal. Many species are either expanding or contracting their ranges at this time depending on whether they're adapted to colder, drier temperatures (e.g. mammoths, bison), or warmer, wetter ones (e.g. mastodons, camels). If the process is unfavourable for the given species, it will lose diversity and population size. At that point any further pushes might send it over the edge.",

Is this specific to paleontological research (because I would say it's not true generally for the geological/stratigraphic side of things unless you specifically mean the record of glacial extents, etc.). In terms of the lack of record, this is the most problematic in actually glaciated areas, but plenty of our record of glacial-interglacial cycles comes from non-glaciated areas (including much of the megafuana paleontological record).",

There's a big focus on the late pleistocene for the reasons I mentioned above, and the inherent limits of radiocarbon dating. \n\nEven outside of the direct palaeontology, most quaternary research I'm aware of focuses primarily on the LGM, and even more specifically the end of the LGM to Holocene transition. A lot of the computational palaeoecological models still rely on many things like glacial limits, sea levels, and temperature models which are more accurate in near time AFAIK.",

            "comment": "Unfortunately the fossil record isn't the greatest at tracking certain kinds of extinction, and they can often only be inferred. Species with very small ranges are both very susceptible to large-scale changes and very unlikely to be fossilized, but you can reasonably assume that a major change would result in the loss of many of those species. \n\nThe onset of a glacial period should cause some of the following general changes: Global temperatures should decrease, and you would expect temperatures in any typical single location to also decrease. Sea levels will drop, increasing the amount of available land in tropical and temperate coastal areas but potentially decreasing the amount of available land in more polar areas that get covered by glacial advances and ice sheets.\n\nIsland endemic species may go extinct if their island becomes connected to other islands or continents with potential predators/competitors. Soil-specific endemic plants, species limited to certain mountain ranges, and similar endemics may find that the cooler climate exceeds their tolerances. Low-mobility habitat specialists are most at risk there, while high-mobility species may be able to shift their range fast enough to keep up with the temperature change.\n\nThat said, glacial advances that strand populations in unglaciated areas can also lead to the divergence of those populations into new species after enough time. Basically, any major change is likely to cause extinctions but also create new niches and opportunities for divergence.\n\nNo source cited, there are always exceptions, but these are points that are reasonably intuitive.",

While fossils can show up in a lot of places, there is at least one specific case where this could plausibly occur.\n\nIn the western US (where I am, so what I am familiar with), intermountain basins are full of dried lakebeds. During past glaciations and cooler, wetter periods in the west, these were actual major lakes. The lakebed sediments, formed during glacial periods, are frequently fossiliferous. Terrestrial species that could survive without a lake (deer would be a good example) could occasionally get preserved as fossils in lakebed sediments, but once the lakes dry at the end of the glacial period, the deer would continue to exist in the same general region while fossilization stops or at least slows dramatically.\n\nWhile many of these former lakes are much older, Arizona and Nevada have many that held water in the most recent glaciation \\~10,000 years ago, and still-living species certainly could have been fossilized.",

The Ice Age, which started around 2.6 million years ago and lasted until about 11,700 years ago, was marked by multiple glaciations and interglacial periods. These climatic changes had a significant impact on various species.\r  \n\r  \nDuring the Ice Age, glaciers advanced and retreated, causing drastic changes in ecosystems and altering habitats. Many species that were adapted to warmer climates struggled to survive in the harsh conditions of the expanding ice sheets. Large mammals, such as mammoths, mastodons, and saber-toothed cats, went extinct, likely due to a combination of habitat loss, competition, and climate change.\r  \n\r  \nThe extinction events during the Ice Age were not limited to large mammals. Many other plants and animals, including smaller mammals, birds, and marine life, also experienced significant population declines or extinctions. The exact causes of these extinctions are complex and can vary from region to region, but the overall climatic changes associated with the Ice Age played a crucial role in reshaping ecosystems and driving the disappearance of numerous species.",

And even today there are some trees that grow to be hundreds of feet tall.\n\nMore recently, in the age of the megafauna (giant sloth, mastodon, etc) the trees were similar to what we see today and had fruit specifically adapted to be eaten by those megafauna. That's why all around North America there are trees that bear large fruit that are inedible to humans. They used to be eaten by animals that don't exist.\n\nLook into the book \"Ghosts of Evolution\" for a really in-depth look into how plants evolved to species that no longer exist. Really fascinating read.",

I live rural and can say cows and horses will both eat Osage Orange but, and here is the catch, it\u2019s usually mid winter. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nOne factor in that is the fruit has been on the ground for awhile and seems to change a bit from fresh green sticky fruit. Less sticky, a bit softer. A second factor is they are tired of eating hay provided by farmers for months and seem to enjoy a different treat. \n\nSquirrels most certainly will eat hedge apples but not as a primary food source. I had a mast year with Black Walnut trees this year and it\u2019s clear squirrels vastly prefer this to acorns and hedge. They hardly touched a hedge Apple this year. I fed the hedge apples to neighbors horses on occasionally this winter. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n Disclaimer: not a biologist. Just a careful observer.",

Maybe the owner of the property cleans them up or local deer munch on em?  \n\nI've never paid much attention to when it fruits, but it's usually after the (gorgeous) wild Spider Lillies around here pop up seemingly over night; which happens around Halloween time; give and take a month. Aside from getting concussed by a falling one, I'm always worried I'll roll an ankle or slip on a rotten one on the sidewalk/street.  \n\nFunny thing is, after all these years, I'm *just now* learning what they are.",

For example, a 2015 study indicated that Osage orange seeds are not effectively spread by extant horse or elephant species,[30] while a 2018 study concludes that squirrels are ineffective, short-distance seed dispersers.[9] The claim has been criticised as a \"just-so story\" that lacks any empirical evidence.[10]\n\n(...) The edible seeds of the fruit are used by squirrels as food.[32] Large animals such as livestock, which typically would consume fruits and disperse seeds, mainly ignore the fruit\"",

It\u2019s a frustrating process really because absence of evidence isn\u2019t evidence of absence and you just hope that somewhere the environmental conditions were right to preserve a giant ground sloth that suddenly died while eating an Osage orange, and even then it would be way better if there lots of preserved ground sloths eating them.",

They were similar in SIZE, but the T-Rex weighed much, much less.  Dinosaurs around 20 tons existed but they were much larger in size. \n\nSize estimations tend to be pretty accurate, by the way. Weight estimations are harder, but if we know the general body plan of an animal and we find a femur or a particular size, it's not hard to estimate how large the animal was to within some order of magnitude.\n\nHere, have a list of big ones, you could google these yourself: [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Biggest-Dinosaurs-ver20-en.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/69/Biggest-Dinosaurs-ver20-en.svg)  \nAnd that's only a few of the species we know of.",

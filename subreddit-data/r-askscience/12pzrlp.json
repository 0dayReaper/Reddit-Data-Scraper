    "postText": "I was listening to an NPR piece on the radio about how engineers in Galveston, Texas have to upgrade Coastal infrastructure as a function of Antarctica's melting rate. The segment said that coastlines closer to Antarctica were impacted *less* than coastlines further away. They didn't explain the scientific reasoning behind it though!\n\nEdit - Found the piece for reference!\n https://www.npr.org/2023/04/17/1170371283/how-disappearing-ice-in-antarctica-threatens-the-u-s",

            "comment": "Without knowing the details of the story, I would guess that what they're alluding to is the influence of [post-glacial rebound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound). In short, the crust in areas that were formerly covered by ice sheets (or thicker ice sheets) during the [last glacial maximum (LGM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Glacial_Maximum) were depressed by those ice sheets. Since the ice sheets melted, the crust has been rebounding, resulting in local uplift (and this is mostly reflecting a response to past melting with the current melting of Antarctica, and Greenland, contributing to future continued rebound). This in turn influences *relative sea level* in those locations. Global changes in the ocean level measured relative to a fixed datum are *eustatic sea level* variations. For example, if eustastic sea level is going up by 3 mm/yr, but the rocks that underlie the coastline in a particular location are rising by 5 mm/yr, then relative sea level in that location is actually going down by 2 mm/yr. \n\nMore broadly, local effects can significantly vary how relative sea levels respond to eustatic sea level changes. If for example, an area is experiencing subsidence, this can exacerbate sea level rise (e.g., in some location instead there was a 3 mm/yr eustatic sea level rise, but with 2 mm/yr of subsidence, then the relative sea level change in that location would be a rise of 5 mm/yr). For example, subsidence along with eustatic sea level rise is generally exacerbating relative sea level rise in many places along the Gulf Coast of the US.",

                    "comment": "On my first read, I assumed that OP's story was referring to the decrease in the gravitational pull from the Antarctica ice sheet melting.\n\n[Sea levels within ~2000 km of Antarctica will *decrease* as the ice sheet melts](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/the-fingerprints-of-sea-level-rise) at least ignoring other influences on sea level, since within that distance the gravitational pull of the ice sheet has a greater influence on sea level than the ice-sheet's amount of water added to the oceans would have.\n\nSo for coastlines in the northern hemisphere (and opposite Greenland for that ice sheet), melting ice sheets will have a double-effect on coastlines. The added water itself increasing sea level, and also the redistribution of water that *had* been previously more pulled toward where the ice sheets are today. Not including the thermal expansion of water playing a role.\n\nIsostatic rebound is another factor, important locally but negligible in the impact on global coastlines I assume?\n\nDo you happen to know if the influence of isostatic rebound on Antarctica's coastline is a greater or smaller factor than the receding ocean level from lost gravitational pull? I remember learning about them all in school, but never heard how influential each is.",

Many places in the northern hemisphere thay were covered by kilometers of ice during the height of the last ice age are still rebounding, so much so that the rebound rate is faster than the sea level rise. Other places near the coast are sinking because of development (buildings are heavy) and channelization of rivers (sediment that drops out before the ocean is heavy). As Antarctic ice melts this will also cause isostatic rebound on that land mass. I don't think gravitational pull has too much to do with it, but thermal expansion could be a bigger factor.",

I don't think it is a small factor at all.\n\nI haven't listened to the OP's posted NPR piece, but OP's post itself doesn't say that Texas' coastlines will be impacted more than Antarctica's coastlines, but more than coastlines *near* Antarctica. Isostatic rebound would only influence Antarctica's coastlines alone (more than negligibly). So I don't get the impression they are talking about isostatic rebound either, unless it was mis-quoted by OP.\n\nIIRC thermal expansion has about the same total effect as the directly added water (on modern timescales) so that would make sense to me - but it would be weird to highlight that difference by comparing to coastlines *near* Antarctica. Still, maybe that's what they were getting at.\n\nBut the effect of the gravitational pull does fit the OP's description - from that alone, Texas' coastlines *will* be significantly more impacted than coastlines near Antarctica.",

That is a lot of land that is being forced down by a hell of a lot of ice that will displace a lot of ocean around the edges as the ice sheet melts and the land rebounds.",

Antarctic ice loss is adding to sea-level rise, and this is one area that will be among the worst affected.",

Sea level is rising all over the world but the land that it is rising against varies. The entire Texas Gulf Coast is very low lying. It is literally swamps 30-40 miles inland from the coast. Other factors in some areas mean the land is actually sinking while the sea is rising. Some areas like the Norfolk area in Virginia are sinking due to post glacial rebound. The Louisiana and Texas gulf coasts are also sinking because oil and gas production has removed so much material from underground that the entire crust is lowering as the layers with oil and gas removed compact. There is also a factor of thermal expansion of the water. Areas with warming seas will see higher sea level rise as ocean or gulf warms up from climate change.",

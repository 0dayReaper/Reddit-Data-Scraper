            "comment": "That classification is not about how much any type of exposure is likely to cause cancer. It tells you the quality of evidence for calling something carcinogenic. Which means that current evidence supporting hotdogs' carcinogenity is as strong as the evidence for carcinogenity of smoking.\n\nSmoking may increase risk of lung cancer by, say, 300%(making up numbers), and hotdogs may increase risk of colon cancer by 20%, risk ratios are beyond the scope of this classification.",

            "comment": "Like wwasdsaw said, groups are based not on \"potency\", but on certainty. The IARC has four groups:\n\n* Group 1: Carcinogenic to humans. We know for sure that these are carcinogenic. Smoking, solar radiation, and processed meats are in this category.\n* Group 2A: Probably carcinogenic to humans. We're *pretty* sure that these are carcinogenic, there's clearly some sort of link, but we aren't as confident as we are for the group 1 carcinogens. HPV, Roundup, red meat, and NDMA are in this category.\n* Group 2B: Possibly carcinogenic to humans. There's limited evidence in humans, and less-than-sufficient evidence in animals. These are things that *might* be carcinogenic, but that need more research before we can say that for certain. Gasoline, engine exhaust, and progestin are in this category.\n* Group 3: Not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity in humans. There's not enough evidence that it's a carcinogen in humans, and either insufficient or limited evidence in animals. Coffee, chlorinated drinking water, and printing inks are all in this group.\n\nAs for how processed meat actually causes cancer...\n\nMeat processing usually involves the formation of carcinogenic compounds. One way this happens is through smoking meats; another is through curing, adding nitrates or nitrites. Another risk is involved with high-temperature cooking, which produces heterocyclic amines and polycyclic amines. You'll note that red meat is a group 2A carcinogen; this is largely due to the presence of haem.\n\nWhen these compounds enter your body, through the digestive process, they can be turned into carcinogenic compounds. Some of the compounds aren't transformed in the body but are just consumed and can cause damage directly. Similarly to how we'd expect cigarettes to cause damage to- and thus lead to cancers of- the throat, mouth, and lungs, processed and red meats have been linked to cancers of the rectum, colon, and stomach.\n\nOne way to think about it is like spicy stuff. We're equally sure that a jalapeno pepper and a carolina reaper pepper have capsaicin in them. If you're reallllllllly spice sensitive- maybe you take a medication that makes you more sensitive to spice, or have a family history of spice sensitivity- you might want to avoid jalapenos. Some people might be comfortable eating a few jalapenos a week. Either way, it's generally a pretty good idea to avoid the carolina reapers, since even the most spice-insensitive people will experience a whole lot of spicy.",

            "comment": "Yes, due to very different climate conditions and thes species types. Life was very different before photosynthesis supported things they needed oxygen. Similarly, before terrestrial trees and grasses evolved, fungus would have ruled and there was not forest/jungle/grassland equivalents. Also before insects evolved to eat wood, there would have been trunks and branches forming a biome that might have been like a seaside marsh, or maybe even a reef.",

            "comment": "Hard to answer for largely semantic reasons. **Biome** is a somewhat ambiguous term that generally refers to a region containing similar communities of organisms due to similar physical conditions. There's not really any objective standard to distinguish them, it's a somewhat subjective process of cataloguing the distribution of modern organisms and dividing them up as best you can, with different schemes varying in how finely those divisions are made. So in the past, there were different physical conditions and communities of organisms, so you can argue there were different biomes, but there's just not any strict definition you could use to say when that happened or what the exact biomes were.\n\nBut your reference to tropical and tundra makes me think you may be referring to **climate zones**, which are often confused with biomes; i.e. the Koppen-Geiger or Holdridge schemes. These are more strictly defined based on parameters like temperature and precipitation, but are often defined in a way to try and replicate biomes; i.e. they look at a biome map and try to find the climate conditions particular to each biome. But the thing is, these are often defined in such a way that they encompass all possible parameters; e.g., in the Koppen-Geiger system, tropical zones and hot desert have minimum temperatures, but no maximum temperature, so even if you get surface temperatures as high as Venus, that still technically fits. If we had lived at a different time in Earth's history, we probably would have defined these differently to better reflect the conditions of that time, but again there's no objective standard for that because they were somewhat subjectively defined to reflect the conditions of modern Earth.\n\nStill, to try and answer the spirit of your question, you may want to look into the mammoth steppe of the Pleistocene, the dry Mediterranean basin of the Miocene, the polar rainforests of the Eocene and earlier, the glass sponge reefs and floating log communities of the Jurassic, the pangean megamonsoon of the Permian and Triassic, the fungal proto-forests of the Silurian and Devonian, and the cold Rodinian interior of the Cryogenian.",

            "comment": "On the Northern hemisphere at high lattitude in the Tundra, the plants receive few hours of sunlight and grow slow. During the ice ages however, this plantworld covered an area at lower latitudes that stretched over continents. There, from the UK to Vladivostok, it had a much bigger productivity, and supported large animals like wooly mammoth. I would argue that the tundra now and during the ice ages are not the same biome, since present tundra cannot support the same population of species. Similarly, during those Ice age times in the continental US, there were large herbivores too. And today some species still point back at that gone biome. Like the Californian condor that used to scavenge those big herbivores on the endless planes. Or the avocado plant that evolved to pass through the gut of those big herbivores.",

            "comment": "Tough to say. Id say there is a pretty big variety of climatic conditions still. Even in past ice ages, tropical forests existed and still do. Earth has always stayed pretty varied even with varied climate fluctuations. Maybe you could consider mammoth steppe a biome? But Kinda depends on the definitions. For example, is a landscape dominated by now extinct species a different biome than one now? Some ancient carboniferous forest or something different.",

Its a lava ball. Cellular organsims came through asteroid water and those initial species thht survived were \"extremophile\" that are still present in volcanos and space and deep  water and deep ice",

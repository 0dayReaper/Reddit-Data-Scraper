            "comment": "Breast tissue is not cancerous. It is more susceptible to cancer development.\n\nThere are several reasons for it that can have various degrees of impact, depending on individual biology, life style and genetic predisposition.\n\n1. Breast tissue can be very dense. Statistically, more cells means higher probability of cancer\n2. Breast tissue contains gland tissue, which is also prone to develop cancer\n3. Breast tissue is continuously exposed to hormonal changes. Especially exposure to certain sexual hormones can lead to higher likelihood of cancer development\n4. Breast tissue has a relatively high proliferation rate, meaning cells turn over a lot, causing oxidative stress that negatively impacts genomic stability\n\nIn case you want or need more information on breast cancer in a digestible format, the breast-cancer community is very active when it comes to education. Patient organizations, healthcare organizations as well as pharma-associated initiatives provide a lot of info on this subject. Good places to start your research are the American cancer society, breastcancer.org, the breast cancer research foundation as well as WHO.",

                    "comment": "I agree with most of your comment except a couple points. \n\nRe: oxidative stress - sure the breast tissue does encounter this but unlikely to be at a substantial enough difference to be clinically relevant. \n\nSame point goes for environmental toxins. The whole body is exposed to the vast majority of toxins. One could argue that toxin\u2019s which would preferentially go to breast tissue would also go to other adipose-rich tissues and other glandular tissues too. So with that, yes environmental factors play a role but not selectively higher in breast than other tissues. \n\nThe most common reason is breast tissue is rapidly proliferating, multiplying and changing. It is also hormonally mediated to drive that process hence the association with estrogen exposure. This is in keeping with many other cancers which most often occur in proliferative tissues (skin, blood, stomach, GI Tract).",

                            "comment": "Lifetime exposure to estrogen is related to breast cancer risk. The more time you spend pregnant and/or breastfeeding, the fewer menstrual cycles you will have over the course of your lifetime; hence, lower lifetime estrogen exposure. In addition, breastfeeding causes cells in the breast tissue to differentiate into mature milk-producing cells, and more differentiated cells are less proliferative and has less prone to becoming cancerous. In addition, some of the benefit of breastfeeding may be correlation rather than causation, since women are less likely to drink alcohol or smoke while they\u2019re breastfeeding.",

                            "comment": "You are correct. During pregnancy and breastfeeding, the breast tissue undergoes changes that make it less susceptible to cancer development. During lactation, the breast tissue undergoes a process called differentiation, which leads to the production of specialized cells that are less likely to become cancerous.\n\nStudies have found that women who have given birth and breastfed for a longer duration have a lower risk of developing breast cancer. In fact, breastfeeding for 1-2 years has been shown to reduce a woman's risk of breast cancer by as much as 25%, and the protective effect may last for several years after breastfeeding has ended.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that while pregnancy and breastfeeding can lower a woman's risk of breast cancer, they are not foolproof methods of prevention. Other aforementioned factors can still increase a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.",

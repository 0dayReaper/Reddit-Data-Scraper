    "postText": "If my question is confusing, it\u2019s like this:\n\nEvery substance has spectral emission and absorption lines. We can use those to identify substances in and around objects in space, for example. However, these absorption and emission lines don\u2019t correspond to the color of a substance if I were to look at it in a macroscopic amount. \n\nLike the spectral lines for indium make it appear indigo (hence the name) but in reality it is a silvery-white metal. Iodine (afaik) also has pretty weak violet lines in its spectra, but it appears that color in vapor form. This is odd to me because what a substance absorbs and reflects directly contributes to its color, and spectral lines (which describe that concept) seemingly don\u2019t match up.\n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m misunderstanding or misrepresenting something, so if someone could explain this to me I would appreciate it greatly.",

            "comment": "I think your confusion comes from lumping together a couple concepts in the single idea of \"spectral lines.\"  The color you see when you look at something is the wavelengths of light that get reflected, not emitted.  Unless you're talking about phosphorescence or fluorescence (the material was first excited by exposing it to light, and now it is giving that energy back as light with characteristic wavelengths), the color you see comes from the light you are illuminating the material with, less whatever wavelengths the material absorbed.  So absorption wavelengths do come into play, but they are the colors you **don't** see.\n\nThe reason you don't see colors from emission spectral lines, is that you are normally looking at materials in their ground state.  Emission takes place from electronic excited states:  when an electron drops back down from an excited state orbital to a ground state (or lower excited state) orbital.  So you do see this in a [flame test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flame_test), or [phosphorescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorescence), or [fluorescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence).  And astronomers do study emission lines to identify the chemicals in [protoplanetary disks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protoplanetary_disk), where newly formed stars are irradiating and exciting the gasses around them.  But these are not the typical conditions you are looking at a material with, in your day to day experience.\n\nAnd then there are metals.  They are a little different then the atoms themselves, in that the valence electrons are no longer in orbitals characteristic of a specific atom, like they would be in a flame test. The valence electrons in a bulk metal delocalize and form a sea of electrons in a more or less continuous [valence or conductance band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valence_and_conduction_bands).  These behave differently and metals typically look shiny, instead of colored.\n\nTLDR:  So you don't see colors from absorbance spectral lines **because**  they are absorbed.  And you don't see emission spectral line colors, except in special cases when something is exciting the material.",

            "comment": "Normal trichromats have three cone types which have different sensitivity ranges for wavelengths of light. There is also a lot of post-processing that combines information across cone types. \n\nA single wavelength of light can stimulate all three cone types. The relative activity of the three cone types can allow us to distinguish between different wavelengths. These are called [spectral colors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_color).\n\nHowever, there are some combinations of wavelengths that stimulate photoreceptors in a pattern that cannot be produced by a single wavelength. These are non-spectral or extra-spectral colors. That is, there are color experiences that we have (purple, pink, brown) that cannot be produced by any single wavelength of light. This is because of the particular properties of our visual systems and not because of the light itself. \n\nIn addition, it is possible to elicit the same color experience by different combinations of wavelengths: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamerism_(color)\nThis is a case where our photoreceptors fail to distinguish between these combinations and so produce identical responses which results in identical color experiences.\n\ntl;dr we can map a single wavelength to a color experience (called a spectral color). It is not as straightforward to connect combinations of multiple wavelengths at different intensities to a color experience. For, example mixing a wavelength that we see as green and one that we see as red will produce a yellow color experience (see [additive color mixing] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color))",

            "comment": "What we commonly refer to as \"spectral emission lines\" or \"absorption lines\" mostly apply to the element or substance in a gaseous or plasma state. The visible (or near-visible) emission or absorption is related to the quantised energy levels of the outer electrons of an atom (although the actual details of why you get what wavelengths gets very complicated for all but the simplest of atoms).\n\nFor example, the element sodium has two principal emission lines near 589nm. If you have the sodium as a low pressure gas, and make it a plasma, by electrical discharge e.g. in a (low-pressure) sodium lamp, then you do indeed get an orangey-coloured light matching the emission lines. (In a more modern \"high pressure\" sodium streetlamp the higher pressure broadens the emission lines and makes a more broadband pinky-coloured light).\n\nHowever, if you have a lump of sodium metal then (in the brief time before it oxidises) a freshly-cut surface looks silvery-metallic like many other metals. It's reflecting most visible wavelengths. I'm very rusty on the details, but I'm guessing that when its in a metallic state the reflection is largely an effect of the delocalised electrons, which don't then have quantised energy states in the same way as in gas/ions in a plasma.\n\nYou also have emission and absorption spectra in X-ray energies with wavelengths around 0.5 to 2 Angstroms (0.05 to 0.02 nanometres), and these arise from energy-transitions of inner-electrons, and still occur in metals. The inner electrons do not de-localise.",

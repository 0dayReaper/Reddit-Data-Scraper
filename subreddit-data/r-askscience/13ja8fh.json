    "postText": "If a cell becomes irreversibly injured in our body, calcium enters into the cell and activates the enzymes which breakdown all the structures of the cell including nucleus. After losing nucleus, the cell becomes dead and undergoes either necrosis or apoptosis (Ik there are a few other pathways). Then why don't mature RBCs like other dead cells go through the same fate given they both lack nucleus? How come it survives 120 days without nucleus but others don't?",

            "comment": "Loss of the nucleus in itself is not immediately lethal to the cell, especially if it has prepared for the loss. Apoptosis or other types of cell death involve many other pathways causing much more prompt damage, as well as recruiting phagocytes to finish the job. The calcium entry (and caspase activation) you mention notably does not occur in RBCs.\n\nAnother extreme situation is neutrophils literally expelling some or all of their chromatin (DNA + associated proteins) as sticky nets to trap bacteria. The neutrophils can sometimes survive that process.",

            "comment": "Well the cell doesn't really \"survive\". During its formation, it loses its nucleus, mitochondria, and many other organelles as well. It becomes essentially a membrane-bound bag of oxygen-binding hemoglobin that floats around the body. It can perform all its functions without needing all those other things. It's not really a cell like the rest of your cells anymore if it helps to think of it that way. When that sack of hemoglobin and its proteins and membrane degrade enough that they no longer function properly, it is destroyed predominantly by the spleen but the liver and other parts of the reticuloendothelial system will also play a part in turning over the remains.",

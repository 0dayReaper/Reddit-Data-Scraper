            "comment": "It's basically not true. It probably originated with people associating inclement whether with an increase in respiratory infections, however that risk is due to people spending more time in door with others who are sick and by that catching colds. However, if one becomes severely hypothermic, after, for instance, falling into a freezing pond, the immune system may be compromised to the point that an infection is more likely to occur.",

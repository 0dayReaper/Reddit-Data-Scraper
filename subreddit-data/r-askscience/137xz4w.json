            "comment": "You are mostly correct, but it depends on the human that hosts the immune system. They have different performance person to person, and some people may not be able to overcome the evolutions these species develop.\n\nWhat makes MRSA particularly dangerous is its ability to colonize in the human body without causing symptoms, making it difficult to detect and control. MRSA can spread easily in hospitals and other healthcare settings, and can also be transmitted in the community through close contact with infected individuals or contaminated objects. MRSA infections can also be difficult to treat due to the limited availability of effective antibiotics, which can lead to longer hospital stays and increased risk of complications.\n\nC Diff is often contracted in healthcare settings, such as hospitals and long-term care facilities. C. diff is particularly dangerous because it can produce spores that can survive in the environment for long periods of time, making it difficult to control its spread. Some strains of C. diff have become resistant to certain antibiotics, which can make it difficult to treat.\n\nProbably because of how susceptible these two species are to hospital transmission, is why we see so many people with pre-existing immune deficiencies contracting it and giving it a bolstered reputation. These two can be highly resistant to antibiotics, so if your immune system is already struggling, you're going to have a rough time.",

Some bacteria have evolved mechanisms to evade or even exploit the immune system, making it difficult for the body to clear the infection without intervention. Additionally, some bacterial infections can be particularly severe or life-threatening, and may require antibiotics to control or eliminate the infection.\r  \n\r  \nAntibiotics work by targeting specific aspects of bacterial biology, such as cell wall synthesis or protein synthesis, that are essential for bacterial survival. By disrupting these processes, antibiotics can selectively kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria while leaving human cells unharmed.",

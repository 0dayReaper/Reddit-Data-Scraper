I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t know much else and nothing of their social lives or communication. They are broadcast spawners and release eggs and sperm directly into the water so do not need to mate. \n\nThis video might be interesting to you - about 3:30 in you get to see an adult abalone moving around with its sensory tentacles out. \nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kVTe5wyoM6E\n\nThis video is of an abalone outrunning a hungry starfish \nhttps://youtu.be/TTslY9CaKbM",

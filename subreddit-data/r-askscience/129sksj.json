But what is the red liquid accompanying the RBC? does the red liquid come out of the RBC? is the red liquid ACTUALLY the RBC? or",

            "comment": "If you go to Google and search \"blood centrifugation\" then you should be able to find some images of what blood looks like when you spin it down. The red blood cells fall to the bottom of the tube and the yellow liquid near the top is the liquid component of blood. As an interesting aside, if blood is frozen then the blood cells will break open when it thaws. If you spin THAT down, you will mostly be left with pretty much a red liquid because the hemoglobin was freed when the red blood cells busted open. The same will happen if you let the blood sit for several days so that cells start dying.",

Blood also contains white blood cells, platelet cells, plasma (the liquid everything else floats in), and assorted metabolites/waste products/ electrolytes.",

            "comment": "The red colour of blood comes from it's iron composition specifically associated with red blood cells. The liquid medium surrounding these cells (called plasma or serum) is usually colourless or slightly yellow depending on animal species. If this serum becomes red somehow, this would indicate the rupture or destruction of red blood cells so that more iron molecules have been released into the medium.",

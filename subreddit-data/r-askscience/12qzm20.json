It has been theorized that this disease actually got a start because the feed for cows on factory farms included unused parts of slaughtered cows (such as brains).  So, cows don't normally eat cows, but humans have made them cannibals in our quest for the perfect steak at the lowest cost.",

These people supposedly published a warning in a veterinary journal, which of course, wasn't taken very seriously by the (human) medical community.~~\n\nThe article in question was  actually several articles predicting the transmissibility of BSE to humans before a documented case and were published in the late 80s and early 90s by Dr. Stephen Dealler. Prion diseases were well known in humans but vCJD wouldn't be documented until 1996. And his publications were largely ignored by both medical and government regulatory organizations. Sorry about misinforming, but still interesting info.",

Livestocks and ruminants are the main ones that get it (cervids in particular - in some regions in the states the prevalence is as high as 20% among mule deer).\n\nOnes that are less heard about but also get prion diseases include camels, cats (large and domestic ones), and minks.\n\nIt's not just cannibalism that increases the risk of one getting prion disease - consumption of cattle infected with BSE (cattle prion disease) directly led to some of these people or carnivorous animals (namely cats eating contaminated pet food) dying from prion disease. And there's even the argument that BSE itself may have been initially caused by cattle feed that's been tainted by sheep carcass infected with scrapie (ovine prion disease).",

Within species is more common but cannibalism is uncommon. Other than prions themselves other diseases and toxins can be transferred by the process so there is decent selection against the practice in most species",

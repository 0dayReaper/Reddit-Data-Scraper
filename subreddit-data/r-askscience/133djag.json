More cell divisions, more chances of mistakes. \n\nUV radiation or chemicals can damage cells. The longer you live, the more damage.\n\nMost times, your body can repair the damage or destroy errant cells. Sometimes, the mutation itself kills the cell.Other times, it results in cancer. Life's a casino: the longer you play, the more you lose.",

            "comment": "Cancers generally arise because of mutations.  That\u2019s **mutations**, plural, not one mutation. It\u2019s estimated that there are maybe 6 broad categories of mutation that are needed before a cell lineage goes from normal to outright cancerous.  \n\n&gt;\tThe hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis.\n\n\u2014 [Hallmarks of Cancer: The Next Generation](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674\\(11\\)00127-9) \n\nEach of those steps can be reached in various ways and in different orders, but each generally requires at least one mutation. \n\nSo it\u2019s a question of time. If it takes (random guess) 10 years for each mutation to arise, then you\u2019re 60 before the first cell reaches a fully cancerous state. \n\nThis is wildly oversimplified (for example, mutation frequency often increases greatly as cells progress along the cancerous path, while the immune system often eliminates partially cancerous cells) but the general principle is very simple. Mutations are rare, and getting the right six mutations all together is rare^6.",

Cells have mutations all of time, but we generally are protected from those cells turning into cancer because we have tumor suppressor genes that tell the cell to kill itself. From a probability perspective, you just have higher odds for having two mutations - one that drives cancer and the other that inactivates tumor suppression - in the same cell at the same exact time the longer one lives.",

            "comment": "One of the many possibilities that are being studied is that our immune system is getting worse at recognizing and subsequently whacking random cancer cells, thus increasing the likelihood of some cancer cells getting out of control.\n\nThe role of immunity in oncology used to be a bit ... underrated. By now we know that siccing the immune system on a tumor, if it can be done in a particular patient/cancer (a big if), is extremely efficient and can lead to a complete remission even in otherwise dangerous cancers.",

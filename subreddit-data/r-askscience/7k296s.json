But why set cruising altitude at 33,000 feet and not just 1000 feet?\n\nEdit oh fuck this post gained a lot of traction, thanks for all the replies this is now my highest upvoted post. Thanks guys and happy holidays \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a",

            "comment": "There are generally a few reasons.  One of the biggest being that higher altitude means thinner atmosphere and less resistance on the plane. \n\nThere's also the fact that terrain is marked by sea level and some terrains may be much higher above sea level than the takeoff strip and they need to be able to clear those with a lot of room left over.\n\nLastly, another good reason is simply because they need to be above things like insects and most types of birds.\n\nBecause of the lower resistance, at higher altitudes, the plane can almost come down to an idle and stay elevated and moving so it also helps a lot with efficiency. \n\nEdit:  Forgot to mention that weather plays its part as well since planes don't have to worry about getting caught up in the lower atmosphere where things like rain clouds and such form.",

However, when something goes wrong, falling from 30000 feet gives you a lot more time to fix things than falling from 5000. It's like how ships will often avoid land in a storm - the danger zone is where sky or water meet land, so stay away from that.",

The plane fell, turning over and over, for _5.7 miles_ straight down before the pilots managed to recover and land the heavily damaged aircraft in San Francisco. No one died, but had they been flying at a lower altitude, everyone on board would have been toast.",

One being wearing smoky glasses and putting your head down between your legs while the instructor moves the plane around like a crazy person until you are thoroughly confused as to which way is up. On command they will give you control of the airplane and tell you to get control of the plane. Could be straight down, sideways etc. Needless to say, it's not fun and a change of clothes is sometimes required. If you are going to get sick, this will be the time!",

Or flat gray.  You'd experience the same 1G as that drink does, and without some external reference, it's entirely possible to go through that roll without ever realizing you're upside-down.\n\nYou know the feeling when you corner a little too fast in a car, and you can feel you're being pulled to the side?  Now black out the windows - how do you distinguish between being pulled to the side in a corner, or the vehicle being on its side?\n\nThe only difference between being pull back into your seat because you're accelerating, and being pulled back into your seat because you're flying straight upwards, so the force of gravity is coming from your back - is your trust in which direction the ground is in.  In a car, you can trust that if the wheels weren't pointing at the ground, you'd know about it by now.  In an aircraft, this trust is broken.\n\nThis is what's happening when we talk about a manoeuvre being 1G, or 2G, etc.  That the manoeuvre creates a force on you equal to one, two, etc times the force of gravity.  If that force isn't in the same direction as the floor, your butt (okay, ears) starts lying about which way the floor is.  If your eyes can't add any more reliable data to the situation, instant disorientation.",

And without a visible horizon (be it a working artificial horizon in the aircraft, and they can fail, or the real horizon through the window) you wouldn't notice at all. This in turn would lead to your aircraft flying into the dirt when you try to keep 1G while upside down without the appropriate altitude. (talk about a looping ;)) \n\nThese upset recovery practices are so difficult because this is the problem. You close the eyes while your instructor puts your aircraft in an unusual attitude and you notice that something goes wrong and that your attitude changes, that's true. But in almost all cases you have a totally different idea of what's your attitude than what you finally see and what you need to recover out.\n\nThis is why Instrument rated pilots are trained to be able to ignore their feeling of gravity and just rely on visual cues like most importantly the instruments or, when feasible, outside cues.",

Imagine walking on a treadmill. Easy right? Now turn the lights off, take your hand off the railings, turn around in circles, then stop. Not the same, but gives you an idea how disorienting it can be.   \n\nEdit: Read about [The Leans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_leans). It explains what happens to your ears that causes spatial disorientation.",

Another is that if you're in free fall, you don't experience gravity. That means a plane that's not flying normally can go from generating 1g that's completely artificial in a direction away from the ground, to zero g, and everything in between, and the only way you can tell what's going on is via instruments or some external visual cue - if there is one.",

I didn\u2019t notice the left turn. Then he jerked the plane just a little to the right. When I put my head up, I expected to be in a sharp right bank. We were in a left dive. What he had done was to put us in so much of a left bank that a slight right jerk still kept us in the left bank. It was incredibly disorienting and one of the lessons I remember being very humbling.

They kept the plane on autopilot while diagnosing it, but the autopilot wasn't set up to control the plane's rudder, so with the asymmetric thrust the plane eventually rolled and stalled.  After that it began to fall and the pilots assumed the artificial horizon had also malfunctioned as they attempted to correct the plane's plunge - because it told them it was inverted and all that.\n\nThe captain brought the remaining three engines to idle to slow the plunge, but miscommunication happened and the flight engineer didn't see this, saw the engine performance roll back to idle and attempted to get the engines back to full throttle, but the aircraft was so far out of limits that they responded slowly so he thought they'd failed.\n\nEventually the plane began to break up and sustained damage to it's tail from aerodynamic stresses, *but* then it came out of the clouds and the pilots were finally able to correct the fall and land,despite the damage.

They'll bend the wings up and down to see at what point they snap. Then every plane after construction will go through stress tests, not to the point that the wings will snap(obviously) but there is a standard and the wings will be bent to that standard force, and if they break off at or before that point the plane isn't commissioned. There are many stress tests than just wing flexibility that prototypes are pushed to their limits on. \n\n[Here's a boeing 787 dreamliner going through a wing stress test](https://www.wired.com/images_blogs/autopia/2010/03/index.jpg)\n\n&gt; Also I'm wondering what the comment above yours said, and why it (along with many others) have been removed?\n\nProbably because they don't meet the commenting guidelines on the sidebar.

All of the signs that would need to be switched; the laws that would need to be updated; the measuring devices that would need to be re-issued or re-labeled; the textbooks that would need to be updated; and so on. And that's not even touching on how much effort it would take to re-educate people, many of whom aren't the least bit interested in re-learning a whole new system. The imperial system survives because of inertia.\n\nIf you think that's a poor argument, then tell me - why are you still using a QWERTY keyboard instead of using some other superior layout (Colemak, Dvorak, Workman, etc.)?",

Think of it like the wake of a boat. The more efficiently a boat can cut through the water, either by size or shape, the smaller the wake. \n\nSonic boom intensity decreases as it gets farther from the plane, so fighter jets might seem louder in that regard, since they generally operate at much lower altitudes.",

But worse yet,  when they recovered, after significantly placing the plane in an over-speed condition, a condition that actually resulted in some panels tearing off, they elected to continue to their destination in Washington instead of opting to request an emergency landing at the nearest airport. I believe that would have been Vancouver or Victoria. IIRC. Likely have some details wrong but it was quite an interesting story. Not sure I know of any other aircraft of that style that survived a complete un-commanded roll. ",

Thus, by flying at a high\naltitude, the pilot is able to operate at flight levels where\nfuel economy is best and with the most advantageous cruise speed.\nFor efficiency, jet aircraft are typically operated at high\naltitudes where cruise is usually very close to RPM or exhaust\ngas temperature limits.\n\nhttps://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/airplane_handbook/media/17_afh_ch15.pdf",

Modern airliners go in a straight line and need to be fuel efficient. They have fairly low drag coefficients. Fighter jets have enormous power plants and need enough control surfaces to turn on a dime as well as equipment / fuel pods / missiles hanging off their wings. So they tend to have higher drag coefficients. The new F-35, for example, has quite a bit of drag to it.",

Turboprops are more efficient at lower speeds, but as they begin to go over very roughly half the speed of sound, the propeller tips begin to approach the speed of sound, and they tend to become increasingly inefficient.\n\nOverall drag for a given aircraft at a given angle of attack increases  (at low mach numbers) roughly as the square of the speed, with the power required as the cube of the speed, but overall efficiency depends only weakly on the speed (at low mach numbers), because the glide ratio depends only weakly on speed.  A faster aircraft has much more drag, but it tends to gain lift roughly in proportion, and can carry much more, and these effects tend to cancel out in terms of overall efficiency, so long as we make the aircraft heavier.\n\nAbove around 500-600 mph, drag starts to increase sharply due to approaching the speed of sound, so this tends to be the designed cruising speed of larger aircraft, since in terms of efficiency you can  get this much speed almost for free, so long as you make the aircraft bigger.\n\nThe minimum weight to fly efficiently at this speed is significantly decreased by flying at altitude, but there is a limit to this as engine power/weight ratio also decreases at altitude.\n\nTheoretically it would be a bit more efficient to make larger planes which fly at low altitude in the same speed range, but there would be issues with mountains/obstructions and also with getting down to a landing speed which is possible with current runway lengths, so this is not currently done.\n\nActually, most planes are mainly designed to fly at about the same altitude because that's what the air traffic system is designed to handle, but the above arguments show why there isn't a major push to change this and fly at a different altitude.\n\n\n",

Jet engine thermal efficiency is a major part of the reason for the ideal cruise altitudes we see, it should be mentioned in the top comment. \n\nTo give you more info, the atmosphere (barring localised weather conditions) cools at a constant rate with increasing altitude up until you reach ~10,000m. See [this graph]\n (http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/images/atmslayers.gif) it's not a coincidence we fly at the corner of the first isotherm. \n\nThermal efficiency of a jet / turbo fan engine is proportional to the ratio between ambient temperature and max internal temperature.  Simplified, thermal efficiency = 1 -  (T_ambient)/(T_Internal). So all the time you're increasing altitude you're increasing your engines efficiency. But once you reach the isotherm at ~10,000 metres you no longer get any increased efficiency with increasing altitude.\n\nThrust, lift and skin friction drag all scale down with density but eventually with increasing altitude you need to travel at speeds where transonic effects dominate drag just to maintain the same lift which would ruin efficiency. \n",

Efficiency is primarily gained by the much much colder air temperatures at higher altitudes, which more than offsets the reduction in thrust due to less dense air. I can\u2019t recall exactly why this is but the lower temperature is the biggest reason turbine engines are best at high altitudes. \n\nAlso, because of the thinner air, for a given indicated airspeed, true airspeed (airspeed through an air mass) and subsequently groundspeed, increases as your altitude increases. In the end you go faster for less fuel as you get higher, up to a certain altitude. Then the temperature stops dropping and you run into increased costs to keep the cabin pressurized to below 10,000 feet. IIRC, this is somewhere in the 40,000 feet range. ",

Here are the reasons. \n\n1.\tAs mentioned, thrust required to cruise decreases with altitude due to reduced drag forces on the aircraft, which is a product of reduced air pressure/density.\n2.\tThe thinner air is easier to work for the compressor, resulting in reduced maximum temperature in the combustion chamber (or as someone else stated, one may trade reduced temperature for increased compression ratio leading to reduced fuel consumption). This reduces stress on components, and therefore maintenance costs. About 35,000 feet is the sweet spot- any higher and the compressor has to work harder to supply the desired pressure. \n3.\tFuel consumption is inversely related to airflow through the engine.  This doesn't sound quite right but I'm looking at the equation to justify this;  I'll check the theory and get back to this if possible. Note: *Thrust* is directly related to airflow. \n4.\tLess birds/air traffic. \n5.\tNoise. \n\nI don't know why there are comments referencing pressurization of the aircraft.  Pressurization relies on the engine for air and power, so it's the engine that matters. There is less pressure differential on the structure below 8,000 feet, as the pressure inside is the same as the outside air- so you're not reducing stress on the airframe or anything. \n\n",

I work for an airline and make the flight plan. I plan the route, fuel load, and... altitude.\n\n95% of the reason you fly at the altitude you do is due to efficiency. At higher altitudes the air is thinner and there's less drag (air resistance) on the fuselage of the plane. The engines are also at their maximum efficiency at higher altitudes. \n\nMost passenger jets are going to be cruising at 30,000-41,000ft. The reason you won't see airliners going above 41000ft very often is that the airplane isn't designed to go any higher. Air gets progressively thinner the higher you go. The difference between the high pressure air in the cabin and the thin air outside above 41000ft could cause structural damage to the fuselage. There's also an aerodynamic problem you run into at higher altitudes called the \"coffin corner\". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin_corner_(aerodynamics) Some private jets can go up to 50,000ft.\n\nSo all else being equal, I want to plan my flights as high as possible to save my company as much fuel as possible. Basically that means 41,000ft. But I very rarely do that for the following reasons...\n\n1. Weight. If the plane has a decent payload or lots of gas, it's probably not going to have enough power to climb up that high. So rather than 41,000ft we have to settle for a lower altitude. Being heavier also lowers the altitude at which the coffin corner becomes a problem. On very long flights they do what's called a \"step climb\" where climb a little higher throughout the flight as you burn off fuel and get lighter. So on a flight from New York to Tokyo, the airplane might level off at 30,000ft. By the time it reaches the halfway point it might be at 34,000ft. By the time it starts it's final descent into Tokyo it might be at 38,000ft. This is all to ensure that the aircraft is close to it's most efficient cruise altitude for it's weight the entire flight.\n\n2. Regulations. In the U.S. westbound flights are supposed to fly at even altitudes and eastbound flights fly at odd altitudes. \n\n3. Weather. Flying above weather isn't a concern since we're already trying to get as high as possible. If a flight can't get above it, I'll plan a route around it. The are cases where you might fly at a lower altitude to fly underneath some turbulence or strong headwinds. If there's lot's of turbulence along a route I'll either set the altitude beneath it or give the flight some extra gas so the pilots can hunt for better rides at less efficient altitudes. If the core of the jetstream is at 39,000ft it might make sense to duck down underneath it if you're flying into it. Or if the jetstream is lower it might be a good idea to fly lower and take advantage of the tailwind.\n\n4. Length of flight. There's no sense in climbing all the way up to 41,000ft just to start your final descent five minutes later. Climbing burns more gas than cruising. ",

            "comment": "Airplanes fly as high as they can because the air is thinner and jet aircraft become more efficient the higher they go.  \nAll problems of dense, turbulent air minimize as you head up.  A jet may fly 400 MPH at 10000 feet but can reach 600 MPH at 33000 with the same or less effort.   That saves fuel, which adds up per trip.   It reduces the strain placed on the airframe by random air currents as they are not as dense.   It also allows better progress against the curvature and rotation of the earth.   There are also extremely fast air currents at high altitudes that can be utilized for a \"tail wind\" effect that pushes the relative ground speed of an aircraft even higher.   There have been times our Global Expresses or 650s will report groundspeeds above Supersonic, even though at their altitude it's only Mach .98\n\n\nTL;DR\n-Saves fuel. \n-Reduces Turbulence. \n-Increases Speed. \n-Reduces air route crowding (our Gulfstreams fly way above commercial aircraft).  \n-Great Circle Routing",

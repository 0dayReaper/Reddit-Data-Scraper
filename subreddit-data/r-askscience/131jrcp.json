I wasn't able to find anything talking about it online, so decided to ask here. \n\nMy guess on it has to do with either the initial formation of a mountain being quite violent and hot enough to fuse the rising summits together, and/or simply erosion smoothing over the details over time.",

            "comment": "Yes, the term you're looking for is a [suture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suture_%28geology%29). It's worth discussing a few other points here though.\n\n&gt; If mountains are formed from the interaction of tectonic plates buckling together\n\nSo, a better way to think about this is that collisional mountain ranges (like the Himalaya) form because one plate is shoved/dragged under another, as opposed to them \"buckling\". Before a collisional mountain range starts to form, the two pieces of continental lithosphere that will eventually collide to form the mountains are separated by an ocean basin (floored by oceanic lithosphere), typically with a [subduction zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction) between them. As subduction continues, the ocean basin shrinks until eventually continental lithosphere enters the subduction zone and the mountain range starts to form slowly. The slab of subducted material that is still hanging out in the mantle (and attached to the continental portion of the plate that is \"going under\" the other) is typically an important driver for mountain range formation (for more on what makes the plates move in general and the role of subduction, check out [this FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/plate_motion_drivers/)). If you want an overview of mountain building (and the follow ups), reading up on the [Wilson Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson_Cycle) might be helpful. The Wilson Cycle is heavily idealized and all of the steps almost never happen in the exact order, but the general processes described in the Wilson Cycle do happen.\n\n&gt; My guess on it has to do with either the initial formation of a mountain being quite violent and hot enough to fuse the rising summits together\n\nThe formation of mountains isn't really any more violent than any other plate interaction. The movement of one plate under the other is accomplished by earthquakes, but the same was true for the subduction zone before the mountain range and virtually any other plate boundary. Collisional mountains form slowly, like most every other geologic process. Sutures can be marked by magmatism and things like plutons, etc., but not always.\n\n&gt; could there be a noticeable 'seam' between the two old plates somewhere along a mountain range?\n\nBack to this idea of a suture, the one tricky thing is that not all sutures are easily recognizable, but many are. Because mountain ranges are preceded by the existence of an ocean basin and subduction, some sutures are marked by [ophiolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiolite), basically bits of oceanic crust that have been scraped up and trapped between the two continental plates defining what we would call an *ophiolitic suture*. Ophiolitic sutures are relatively easy to notice because ophiolites are pretty unique and pretty much always indicate a suture. The formation of mountain ranges can also lead to a fair bit of melting within the crust, so sometimes older sutures in heavily eroded ranges can be recognized by zones of igneous intrusions. They also tend to represent zones of significant deformation, so can be recognizable that way. However, not all sutures have ophiolites or other clear outward signs that they are in fact a suture, especially in younger mountain ranges where there has not been as much exhumation and erosion of deeper rocks. These would be better described as *cryptic sutures*, which basically means in the field they kind of look like any other fault. Identifying cryptic sutures is a bit more challenging and usually requires doing a lot of work on the basic geology of the fault bounded blocks within a mountain range to try to identify where there is a major change in some aspect of the bedrock that might tell you the bits on either side used to be separated by a large basin. Here for example is a [paper](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/135981/tect20504.pdf?sequence=1) that attempts to look for and define the location of a cryptic suture in the Greater Caucasus mountains using where sediment was coming from in different parts of the mountain range and hypothesizing that a cryptic suture exists between where there is a major change in sediment source.",

Sometimes, in a short period, a volcano comes up and creates land and mountains. Othertimes, it's plates over thousands of years pushing up some dirt. Obviously this is super simplified, but there's so much nature that didn't exist at one point and now it's there. That's incredible.",

And on a human level - People in Europe had no idea about North America, or in a broader sense, the people of the world managed to get everywhere... What? If we all started in Africa, the people in North America to be natives when Europeans arrived had to get there somehow. Completely the opposite of other humans who ended up in Europe, Asia, etc. before so much technology. To imagine traveling the world as a species without anything we've made in the last 10k+ years. insane.\nAnd if we didn't all start in one location, for us to have evolved the same in different parts of the world is equally crazy.",

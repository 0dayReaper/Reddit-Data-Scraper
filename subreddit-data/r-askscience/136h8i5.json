[As I recently wrote in The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/el-nino-is-coming-and-ocean-temps-are-already-at-record-highs-that-can-spell-disaster-for-fish-and-corals-202424), it's flooding, droughts, heat waves and cold spells. Any and all of these climate extremes could be in your near future depending on where you live and whether or not you're a fish (welcome to the internet my underwater friends).\n\nMy name is [Dillon Amaya](https://psl.noaa.gov/people/dillon.amaya/) and I'm a climate scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)*. I use a combination of computer model simulations and observations to study climate variability and change, with a particular focus on how things like El Ni\u00f1o impact the world's oceans. Feel free to ask me anything about life, love, and happiness, but also (preferably) about climate change/variability/extremes, El Ni\u00f1o, and/or what it's like to study the ocean from land-locked Colorado.\n\n*Thoughts and opinions are my own. \n\nI'll be around starting at 12 ET (16 UT), AMA!\n\nUsername: /u/DrDJAmaya",

                    "comment": "Part of the reason for all of the hot water this year is because we are exiting three consecutive years of La Ni\u00f1a conditions. La Ni\u00f1a is the cold phase of the [El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation](https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/el-ni%C3%B1o-and-la-ni%C3%B1a-frequently-asked-questions). El Ni\u00f1o (where we are headed) is the warm phase. A general rule of thumb is the planet is naturally cooler during La Ni\u00f1a years and naturally warmer during El Ni\u00f1o years. Global warming doesn\u2019t stop during La Ni\u00f1a years, but its impacts are somewhat dampened when La Ni\u00f1a is around. Now that La Ni\u00f1a is over, we are realizing that heat again. El Ni\u00f1o could exacerbate the warming, accelerating global warming trends this year and possibly into next year.\n\nAs for how the Great Lakes region could be impacted, the unsatisfying answer is \u201cit depends\u201d. El Ni\u00f1o tends to shift the North Pacific jet stream further south during the wintertime, bringing rain to the southern part of the US. So perhaps you could expect drier, possibly colder conditions in the Great Lakes region this winter. That said, an important thing to realize is that all of the weather we experience is part of a probability distribution. Often El Ni\u00f1o shifts the distribution of \u201clikely\u201d weather outcomes preferentially in one direction, but does not guarantee any particular impact.",

To understand how you get to \u201cwarmer-than-normal\u201d, you need to understand what \u201cnormal\u201d means.\n\nNormally, in the eastern equatorial Pacific, winds are blowing from the east and pushing surface waters from west to east. But because we live on a rotating planet, something awesome happens\u2026that water bends to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere due to something called the Coriolis Force (Google it, lots of good YouTube videos describing Coriolis). What that amounts to is surface water is moved by the winds away from the equator, leaving cold, nutrient-rich water from below to rise up and take its place along the equator. We call the process of cold water coming to the surface like this \u201cupwelling\u201d. Upwelling makes the equatorial Pacific quite cold\u2026normally.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, that upwelling is weakened substantially. With less cold water coming to the surface, the water is warmed anomalously (often by 1-2\u02daC). Why does upwelling weaken during El Ni\u00f1o? It\u2019s complicated\u2026the trade winds that drive the upwelling in the first place can weaken. And/or ocean waves (not the kind you surf) generated by \u201cwind bursts\u201d in the far western equatorial Pacific can bring warm water to the east, which takes the place of the cold water that is normally upwelled. Importantly, though, once things start to warm up in the eastern equatorial Pacific, a series of feedbacks (called Bjerknes Feedback) can kick off, which reinforces the conditions that led to the warming.\n\nI realize that a lot of that was not safe for a 5-year old\u2026maybe a well-read 10-year old, but hopefully that helps understand. Here is a [quick video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVlfyhs64IY&amp;t=1s) that can also help explain things in a visual way.",

The latest [IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdf) (kind of a summary of our collective understanding of climate change and its impacts) says that it is very likely that major ocean currents like the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation will slow down over the 21st century, though there is some uncertainty in the magnitude of that weakening.

The location of the warming can have important implications for the kinds of impacts we might expect for other parts of the world. For example, EP El Ni\u00f1o events are typically associated with a warming of the tropical Atlantic Ocean in the following spring and decreased hurricane activity, but CP El Ni\u00f1o events may have a weakly opposite or no effect on the region (e.g., [Amaya et al. 2013](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2013JC009476); [Larson et al. 2013](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012GL052595)).\n\nIn short, it's too early to tell what flavor this upcoming El Ni\u00f1o event will take on.",

You're right that some fishes have the ability to move to their preferred habitat with things get hot, but other critters are stuck in place (e.g., corals) or have limited mobility (lobsters, crabs, etc). Marine heat waves triggered by El Ni\u00f1o can certainly stress these immobile species out and can lead to harmful impacts.\n\nThe most obvious example is coral bleaching, but another good example is the Pacific cod fishery along the US west coast, which declined by 70% after a 2015/2016 marine heat wave, which was partially related to an El Nino event. When the water gets too warm, Pacific cod increase their metabolism, which causes them to burn energy faster than they can eat, leading to death.",

They do have errors/biases, but climate scientists are highly trained to recognize and understand where and when climate models are performing well and how that can be useful.\n\nThe breakthroughs in climate modeling that I have experienced in my career are mainly related to the resolution at which we run these simulations. Older climate models would break the planet up into 200-500 km grid boxes, but now we have the computational power to run global simulations at 10 km resolution or better. Having higher resolution means that you can accurately represent many of the important \"small-scale\" processes that many older models either parametrized (i.e., represented with a statistical relationship that often looks a lot like y = mx +b) or just left out entirely.",

If we instead consider marine heatwaves *relative* to the warmer base climate, we actually don't see that dramatic of a change.\n\nI actually recently led an [article in Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-00924-2) discussing this topic.",

Back in 2015/16 I believe there was a large \u201cblob\u201d of warmer than normal water in the NE Pacific that I believe was linked to a serious drought that lasted through the winter, spring and contributed to a massive wildfire season in BC which included the first instances of extreme wildfire behaviour in a Coastal rainforest setting (near Squamish/Whistler). \n\nMy obvious concern with the return of El Ni\u00f1o conditions is that this may combine with another \u201cblob\u201d condition in the NE Pacfiic leading to new extremes. \n\nMy question: the waters in the NE PAC have been cool this winter. Have you seen any indications or precursors that a Blob\nmight re-emerge? Has there been study on what caused that extreme ocean condition?\n\nThank you.\nChris in Port Alberni, BC Canada",

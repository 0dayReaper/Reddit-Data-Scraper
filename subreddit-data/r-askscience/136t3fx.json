It is still circulating, but the effects are much less on individuals. Add to that many vaccinated persons, etc. and it had run its course.  It will continue to circulate far into the future, but will act like other coronaviruses that currently circulate.",

So I wouldn't say they are working.  \nHowever, it is still circulating, but it is not a virulent. Every time they announce a new variant (I think the latest in Arcturus) they talk about how it is X-times more transmissible than the last - but it causes a less severe disease state. Again, that is due to immunity, vaccine status, and the natural development of viruses.\n\nDid the public health measures make a difference - they saved lives at the time. We would likely be in the same place now in terms of how virulent the disease is regardless of the public health measures that were implemented previously.",

The purpose was to prevent the entire population experiencing a novel (something not previously been exposed to) infection in a short space of time. The fact that it was novel with little/no prior population immunity means the disease would be expected to be more severe (obviously with a lot of individual variation), and whole-population in short space of time would overload the heath services.\n\nThe vaccine, we (naively!) thought would provide immunity, but actually provides modest and waning immunity, but does significantly help the body's immune system  fight the virus, with much less-severe symptoms than had we not been vaccinated.\n\nHaving pushed the vaccine out, and relaxed the social controls gradually, plus ongoing infection cycles, individuals' personal immunity status are somewhat de-synchronised across the population, so while we have infection \"waves\" (that are likely loosely tied to seasons and school term-times) we don't expect to see more than perhaps 1-in-20 infected at any one time, whereas in spring 2020 the spectre of 1-in-5 or something being infected simultaneously was a mathematical possibility.",

Somewhere between 1-in-80 and 1-in-25 people in the population are expected to be infected at any one time in the UK in the past year.\n\nThat said, there's much less testing now, and the figures are harder to find and require more extrapolation from small sample-sizes.\n\nThe severity of disease is generally much lower than in 2020, owing to the vaccines and ongoing waves of infection and partial-immunity.\n\nPeople aren't wearing masks or social distancing in my experience, so that's not keeping numbers down. Many people are socialising a bit less than they used to, particularly the old or those who feel vulnerable. In white-collar jobs, there's still more work-from-home than there was pre-pandemic, so that will limit transmission to a small extent. (Potentially more in white-collar jobs than elsewhere) There's also a greater tendency for people to stay home (and maybe WFH) if they are feeling slightly unwell, rather than go into work and spread it around as would be the norm pre-2020.\n\nBut mostly the numbers probably aren't as low as you think, it's just not newsworthy anymore.",

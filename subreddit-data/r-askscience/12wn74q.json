There is loss in transmission to the wheels that you only want to have happen once, if you can help it.\n\nObviously, a scenario like braking is where you have to stop and eliminate the energy really fast, and that is why we can have regenerative breaking which does help recharge the battery a bit, but that's only useful because we need to do an inherently inefficient thing like braking rather than simply turning off the power and coasting to a stop.",

Transferring energy from a wheel to a hypothetical alternator in the wheel necessarily removes energy from the wheel... that you're already wanting to use to drive the wheel. This transfer is not 100% efficient, so you're bleeding energy away at a loss, to send back, again at a loss, when that energy is already being used to maximum effect in the designs we use now.\n\nYou can recover this energy to a degree when braking, since you want to slow down anyway, but bleeding energy away from an already more efficient transfer just to cycle it back in at a loss when you WANT to be accelerating is taking a loan out at interest, not buying anything with it, and paying it back using the same money from the loan, plus the interest you accrued.",

But you're already using most of this energy to move the car! If you steal some of the energy to recharge the batteries, then it will just make the car move slower. And since the conversion process is not 100% efficient, you would be losing energy on this. It would be easier to simply drive slower.\n\nImagine you have a wallet with money and you use it to pay for lunch. Your question now is \"why can't we at the same time pay for lunch and also save the money, so we can fill the wallet again\". When put like this it should be clear that you simply can't do that, because they money you spent on lunch are already \"used\".\n\nThis idea is used when cars are breaking - normally breaking just turns energy into heat and dissipates it, and instead we could save that.",

            "comment": "You can have then, but they don't do anything useful as you're driving. When braking, however, it's another story.\n\nIn simple terms:\n\nThe normal process is: Battery -&gt; electricity -&gt; motors -&gt; spin the wheels -&gt; motion of the car. So electricity is turned into motion. That's what moves the car.\n\nTo create electricity you'd do the opposite: spinning wheels -&gt; alternators -&gt; electricity -&gt; battery.  This process takes motion and turns it into electricity.\n\nNote that in order for this to work you have to first spin up the wheel, and then slow it down again. The spinning wheel is basically a sort of battery, that you charge by spinning it up, and discharge by slowing it down.\n\nThat's why using the slowing down of a car - the braking - is a great way to recover (some of) the electricity that you put in earlier. Electric vehicles do this.\n\nIn a perfect, lossless system, you'd be able to get as much electricity out as you put in. After all, X electricity used to create the motion, then the motion is used to recreate X electricity.  In reality, especially when talking about pushing cars around, things are not lossless. Energy gets lost in lots of ways. For example, there's friction of the tires on the road, friction of the car against the air,  friction of bearings in the wheels and axles, that all slow down the spinning wheel without recreating electricity. It's why, if you put a combustion engine car that's moving in neutral, it'll slow down and eventually stop. So it's like the wheel battery is leaking charge while you're driving.",

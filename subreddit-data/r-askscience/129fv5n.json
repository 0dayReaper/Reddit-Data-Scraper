            "comment": "During intense exercise you reach an anaerobic threshold, this is the point at which the demand for energy outstrips the ability of the body to supply energy using solely aerobic metabolism. At this point anaerobic metabolism doesn\u2019t become the sole mechanism, it supplements your maximal aerobic capacity, so you will still need a high respiratory rate to continue what aerobic metabolism you can. \n\nBoth aerobic and anaerobic metabolism produce CO2 as a waste product which is excreted by exhalation. Humans have a fairly low tolerance for increases in CO2 in the bloodstream as it decreases pH, as will the production of lactate from anaerobic respiration. The initial attempts to compensate for an acidaemia is by respiratory compensation- you \u2018blow off\u2019 your CO2 to bring the pH back to the normal range. A high production of CO2 is detected by specialised chemoreceptors in the bloodstream and will trigger a drive to increase respiratory rate in order to correct CO2 and keep blood biochemistry as stable as possible, so excess CO2 in itself will give you a high respiratory rate",

Once you get into aerobic activity, you use a more efficient system to create energy and your breathing is more steady. If you increase your workload enough to your anearobic threshold then you start breathing g really fast again. \n  \nThe anaerobic mechanism is best for quick access to energy, which is why it\u2019s what the body uses first. This explains why marathon runners will be out of breath after climbing a few flights of stairs. Stairs are anaerobic and unless you are climbing a ton of them you don\u2019t have time to flip over to aerobic.",

Slower runners it won\u2019t really matter because they can just warm up over the first mile or so. When you\u2019re a faster runner it is really good to do a ten or 15 minute jog warm up with a few strides(ten second fast intervals) mixed in. Some of the marathon paces people run are pretty damn fast and it\u2019s really good to get the muscles warmed up before you start running fast. Also, it decreases the heart rate spike that will happen early on.",

The goal behind the intensity of a warmup is more to prime the pump so to say. \n\nYou would always want to get everything warmed up but priming the anaerobic system is more important for an intense session, especially one that opens up hard. Additionally, I believe there is a neural element as well but thats a thought without any specific research. \n\nExample - long say a long ultra marathon vs a 5 or 10k.",

The grow room that held all the bags of algae were closely monitored.

I'm a pretty large man. Broad shoulders, barrel chested, spare tire, frequently described as intimidating even though I'm a big teddy bear. That may be relevant to the point because every time I walked into the grow room the operator had to go around and make adjustments on every system because I caused such a large spike in the CO2 in the room. The whole ass room. With 9' ceilings, and something like a 30'x40' floorplan. I always joked it was because I was such an efficient respirator, but I've wondered since then if maybe there is something going on,  or if it's just because I'm a big dude with big lungs making big breaths.",

These points are by no means exhaustive!!\n\nSo theoretically speaking to correct the drop in pH you might consider giving bicarbonate. The reason being it is one of the other main determinants of balancing a respiratory acidosis- a chronically raised CO2 (for example in a condition like COPD) will be chronically compensated for by a rise in bicarbonate levels in the blood, however in reality this compensation occurs over weeks/months compared to the rapid changes on CO2 with ventilation. \n\nOne issue you would run in to doing this is that bicarbonate (HCO3-) binds to hydrogen ions and can can be fairly rapidly metabolised to water and carbon dioxide, so an excess bicarbonate load would conversely push your CO2 levels up which in turn would push your respiratory drive up.\n\nYou have the chemoreceptors which respond to pH, so if your theoretical machine could maintain pH by adding the right amount of buffer/removing acidaemic compounds etc, then in theory these would not be activated. However you also have chemoreceptors which respond directly to the amount of CO2 dissolved in the blood (which would still be produced with your athlete surpassing normal limits), and a small shift in CO2 concentration produces a large change in ventilation. In experiments where the peripheral chemoceptors were removed, inhaling CO2 containing gas mixtures still triggers an increase in ventilation because the dissolved CO2 crosses the blood-brain barrier and activates central chemoreceptors which are much more sensitive as there is less buffer in the CSF so small changes in CO2 concentration cause large changes in pH in the CSF.\n\nIf you could somehow maintain blood pH and scrub your CO2 from the blood immediately then there wouldn\u2019t be an increase in respiratory drive from your CO2, however the hypoxic drive would still function (oxygen consumption is increased with exercise and this would trigger a ventilatory increase to supply the demand). This would increase with effort, and beyond your anaerobic threshold is your VO2 max, which is the point at which you reach the maximum possible oxygen consumption- this often would only really be reached by elite athletes.",

Aerobic metabolism can very much use glycogen as a fuel, while oxygen is used as the oxidizer. Anaerobic metabolism can also use glycogen as fuel, it just circumvents using oxygen as the oxidizer.\n\nIn aerobic metabolism, NADH and FADH2 from complete breakdown of fuels like glycogen feed electrons into the electron transport chain and ultimately reduces oxygen to water.\n\nAnaerobic metabolism harvests fewer electrons and instead feeds them into reducing pyruvate (from partial breakdown of glucose/glycogen) to lactate. The lactate accumulates until there's oxygen available to allow this to run backwards and feed the electrons into the electron transport chain.\n\nNot that this directly answers your question, but /u/dougal1084 and others have already done that.",

            "comment": "Glycogen is broken down to form glucose and glucose-1-phosphate (which gets converted into glucose-6-phosphate). These are used in glycolysis to make pyruvate. At this point, there's a crossroads: Anaerobic and Aerobic breakdown. Both pathways use glycolysis to make pyruvate from glucose, but when oxygen is present is sufficient quantities, pyruvate will be converted to Acetyl-CoA and go into the mitochondria to enter citric acid cycle. From there, it produces electron carriers to be used in the electron transport chain, which ultimately leads to the reduction of oxygen to water and production of a high amount of ATP. \n\nWhen not enough oxygen is present (anaerobic conditions), the body still needs energy fast, but it can't produce it fast enough through aerobic respiration. This causes a build up of pyruvate. But here is the issue - for glycolysis to continue to produce some ATP and NADH, it needs NAD+. If pyruvate is building up, then there is also a deficiency of NAD+. This means glycolysis will slow down or halt. To get around this, excess pyruvate and NADH will be used to reduce pyruvate to form lactate (lactic acid depending on the pH). Regeneration of NAD+ by making lactate allows glycolysis to continue again, and allows some formation of ATP. Increases of lactate leads to lactate acidosis, which is dangerous to the cells. \n\n\nOur breathing greatly increases during anaerobic respiration to try and meet the oxygen and by extension energy demands our cells have. There's a lot more to it and way more specific nuances, but this is the basic answer to your question. \n\nGood review: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7983055/",

Meaning, when the oxygen levels have returned to normal. This takes the pathway back to the end of glycolysis and because oxygen has returned, you are able to proceed into the mitochondria and to the Krebs cycle, thus reverting back to aerobic respiration, the more efficient pathway. \n\nYou have not shown me an answer where lactate enters directly into aerobic respiration without first being converted back to pyruvate or glucose first. Which again requires that there be free NAD+ from unloading it to oxygen at the end of the ETC. Because the electrons have to go somewhere. Which means aerobic respiration is happening and anaerobic is not. \n\nYou stated that saying anaerobic respiration is inefficient is misleading. It\u2019s not. You stated that lactate can be used as an input to aerobic respiration. It can\u2019t, unless its converted first into something else. It is inefficient because the pathways you describe above are when the body reverts back to aerobic respiration after oxygen levels have returned. Thus, this means you are no longer performing anaerobic respiration.\n\nEdited to add: in summary, unless cells are well oxygenated and thus able to proceed through aerobic respiration, you are stuck with glycolysis, which only produces 2 ATP and is more inefficient.",

The byproduct of that is CO2, so you're literally having to breathe the fat away.\n\nThat along with all the other processes with CO2 as a byproduct you need to remove as much as possible from your blood.",

            "comment": "Muscles need energy, which is glycogen, therefore it also needs oxygen. Because glycogen is transported through blood vessels from the stomach, which is digested from its raw form of starch by the salivatic amilase into maltose which is then digested in the duodenum part of the intestine into glucose, which is then transported through the intestine walls into blood vessels to be carried throughout the human body. This process requires oxygen. Because blood cells are energised with the existence of oxygen. Thank u bye",

Dirt, oil, weld slag, multiple layers of paint, whatever. If you're in an environment where you don't have to worry about that, a complex geometry is fine. But on a factory floor, Phillips or torx can get irreversibly fouled. Allen head screws can be relatively easily cleaned, but the master of this is the shittiest of all screw heads, the flat head. The *only* tool you need to clear the slot of a flat head screw is the screwdriver you're going to use to unscrew it. No other screw type has that ability.",

            "comment": "The reason for the different styles is cost and torque. The slotted head screws are cheap and easy to make. But they're completely useless for powered screwdrivers and you can't put much torque on the screw without it either slipping out or stripping the head (and maring the surface of whatever you're screwing). Phillips screws are self-centering, making powered screwdrivers possible. They're somewhat more expensive to produce than slotted-head. They tend to 'cam-out' easily under torque, making it hard to apply much torque. I've heard they were designed that way to prevent overtightning. However, it's not good for exposed fasteners to look stripped. Robertson-head and allen-head fasteners can handle more torque than phillips-head fasteners, but are more expensive. Because the bottom of the hole is flat (unlike the pointed end of the phillips), there's more contact area and so it's less likely to cam-out. The robertson-head is cheaper than the allen-head, but the allen-head has six points of contact rather than 4, making it less prone to rounding out the hole. The Torx-head fasteners solve the problem of rounding/stripping by having the flat bottom of the robertson/allen that reduces cam-out, but it has much better contact with the driving bit to prevent stripping the head. The points of the 'star' on the driving bit engage the recesses on the screw at nearly right angles, so it has a very positive contact. Torx is becoming more and more popular because of that, particularly in assembly-line work. Because they're less likely than a phillips to be damaged when tightening, the allen (internal hex) heads are often used for exposed ('decorative') fasteners on 'some assembly required' furniture. It's also very cheap to make the allen keys, so they usually include one with the fasteners.\n",

That's what I like about good torx head screws, is that whatever wood you sink them into will break, rot out, or outlive its usefulness before the screws rust.  On my jobs we usually get a few uses out of them before the heads start to strip, despite the fact that we're always over torquing and countersinking them with impact drivers.  Even if the heads get painted over or filled with dirt you can still get enough grip to zip them out, which is rarely the case with phillips.  I work in historic restoration/preservation so a lot of the screws we use are only temporary which means reusability is a big plus.  ",

They tend to 'cam-out' easily under torque, making it hard to apply much torque. I've heard they were designed that way to prevent overtightning.\n\nIf you look up the patent for the phillips head you will find that the inventor did talk about \"cam-out\" as a benefit, but he was talking about the ability of the drive bit to force debris out of the screw head. It had nothing to do with \"cam-out\" as currently understood. It's a very common misconception.\n\nSee Chapter 2:\n\nhttps://theses.lib.vt.edu/theses/available/etd-42698-205111/\n\n",

Because the bottom of the hole is flat (unlike the pointed end of the phillips), there's more contact area and so it's less likely to cam-out.\n\nWhile I thank you for bringing up Canada's contribution to the fastener world, a couple of things... Robertsons aren't Square-Drive.  While they're square in cross-section, the driver and the hole in the screw are slightly tapered, and the bottom rounded. This makes it much harder to strip a Robertson. \n\nIt also means that the screw can stick to the driver even when both are non-magnetic, which is really handy. ",

Phillips is still the most common for drywall screws or zinc coated wood screws, but things like decking screws and trim screws are almost 50% square/robertson and almost 50% torx. I'm making the numbers up, but it sure seems like that.\n\nI've been working as a carpenter for the past 8 years and torx has gotten more and more popular. Functionally they're only *slightly* better than robertson. I think both screw types have gotten more popular with the rise of the impact driver. Sticks to my driver bit, no worry about stripping. They're great.",

I've had to cut 12 of them off a flex disc on a transmission because they were used as torque-to-yield bolts (bolts designed to be torqued so much they stretch). They later went onto e-torx (external torx) and triple square bolts that allow for a low profile head without being likely to round out. ",

For instance on the products my company sells there are some screws we intend for the customer to undo, and we will use hex, slotted, or Phillips for these.  Other screws we don't want them messing with and may use Torx or something more rare.\n\nIn fact some companies specialize in making strange screw head shapes purely for security reasons, [as seen in this chart.](http://cdn.clm02.com/ezvivi.com/204050/6359362590222142198612765.jpg)",

Instead, it was ever so slightly out of round, and you drove it in with a special socket that was precisely sized to mate with the screw head. Unless you had the tool, the only way to get it out was to treat it like you would a stripped head screw.",

But you need a screw that will hold onto the bit well enough to not fall off.\n\nOthers have mentioned Phillips bits and cam-out. This is desirable. For example: Drywall installers use special screw guns (and you can get drywall bits for regular drills) that will detatch from the screw at the right install depth. Handy for that application.\n\nBy the way, Robertson screws are really friggin awesome. They are just so great to work with in most applications.

Also, so I look manlier when I'm standing around the grill with the other dads at a cookout our wives organized and we start talking about manly dad stuff and I lay down some serious screw knowledge like they're ESPN stats.\n\nThanks everyone!",

The guy who ran the shop was a 40 year tradesman and the best finishing carpenter I have ever met.\nWhen he came on board the first thing he did was replace all our variety of screws for Robertsons. He claimed they were the best screws in the world. I now use nothing else.",

                            "comment": "The reason they never caught on is that a) they are more expensive to manufacture (real Robertsons aren't just a square hole, there's more to it than that) and when they were first developed, the inventor was very protective of his patents and refused to license them. He had been screwed over (if you'll pardon the pun) on some previous inventions, so insisted on owning the sole manufacturer.\n\n",

From Wikipedia: \"Robertson had licensed the screw design to a maker in England, but the party that he was dealing with intentionally drove the licensee company into bankruptcy and purchased the rights at a reduced price from the trustee, thus circumventing the original agreement. Robertson spent a small fortune buying back the rights, and subsequently refused to allow anyone else to make the screws under license. When Henry Ford tried out the Robertson screws, he found that they saved considerable time in Model T production, but when Robertson refused to license the screw design, Ford realized that the supply of screws would not be guaranteed and chose to limit their use in production to Ford's Canadian division. Robertson's refusal to license his screws prevented their widespread adoption in the United States, where the more widely-licensed Phillips head gained wider acceptance.\"",

You may have noticed your screwdriver often pops out under torque - this was originally by design. The driver cams out when too much torque is applied - this was a safety measure to prevent over-torquing the screws.\nEvery design has a story. There's gotta be a book.\n",

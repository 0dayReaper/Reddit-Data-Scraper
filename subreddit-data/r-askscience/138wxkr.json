    "postText": "Was discussing evolution and birds with my kids and had some questions.  I know usually visual traits in other animals like strength, a longer neck, healthy appearance are tied to genetics that make that animal fitter/more likely to survive.  Is this true in birds, and if so, how are the two connected?  I would think there would need to be some advantage to have been selected for.  And why don't the brighter colors lead to being seen by predators more?  I always assumed birds relied on camouflage to survive.  Thanks!",

            "comment": "Well there's more going on there.\n\nSelection occurs both in surviving and attracting a mate to pass on the survival genes\n\nSome animals evolve bright colors indicating poison or at least distasteful to the predator. Think brightly colored caterpillars etc. And so, sometimes that means less predation\n\nAnd, then, bright colors, especially if concealable and shown for mating, make a male more attractive to the female. And, (speculating) if a brightly lit male can survive, it's more attractive to the female too. \n\nAnd the camouflage, hiding from predators while sitting a nest, while males may be more successful finding mates and risking predation \n\nSo trade offs, right? Brightly colored = more attractive, so mates more. And, maybe indicates distasteful = less predation, so mates more.\n\nhttps://www.audubon.org/news/these-amazing-images-show-how-good-bird-camouflage-can-be",

            "comment": "In the populations of wild Guppies (Poecilia reticulata), the females prefer to mate with the more colourful males. At the same time, predation reduces the most colourful of males. Richards Dawkins has a reproductive-success computer simulation on one of his first multimedia products about nature and evolution. It demonstrated how the colourfullness of the local population of  Guppy males went up when you turned the level of predation down, and vice versa. So the most colourfull male in the local environment must be the best specimen to mate with as it still manages to escape predation and gather enough energy to invest in colourful display. I think this is the same in bird populations.",

            "comment": "This isn't just in birds, there are brightly colored animals among many groups (most notably, fish and insects).  \n\nBroadly speaking, the benefit of brightly color coloration comes from several potential places:\n\n1) Bright coloration can make it easier for mates to find you in the first place.  Being seen by predators is bad, but being seen by potential mates is good.  \n\n2) Bright coloration can indicate good diet.  In particular, carotenoids (eat your carrots, kids) are usually variants on orange and red and are good for health.  Showing off bright colors can be a way to show off that you've been eating a good diet.\n\n3) Pre-existing preference: Birds often eat brightly colored fruit.  Sometimes males are brightly colored in the same way the fruit is.  It's thought that females may have a preexisting preference for that particular color and males with that color are therefore more attractive\n\n4) Handicap principal:  This is probably one of the more important reasons.  Being brightly colored shows off that you are generally healthy and also that you are fast and alert enough not to become a snack for a predator.  That means you probably have a lot of other good genes.  \n\nAnd here are a couple of ways bright colors can get more exaggerated:\n\n1) sexy sons:  If (for whatever reason) a particular colorful trait helps males get mates, then females will have an incentive to mate with males with that trait just because then their own sons are more likely to have the trait and get lots of mates.  \n\n2) runaway sexual selection: If females with a preference for a trait mate with males with a trait, their offspring are likely to carry both the genes that cause a preference for this trait _and_ the genes for the trait itself.  If these genes become linked in a population, this can cause a reinforcing spiral where a trait becomes more and more exaggerated beyond what you'd expect.   \n\n\nFinally a note on birds and predation:  Birds are actually less likely to fall prey to predation than a lot of animals, being able to fly really helps them avoid predators.  As a result, some birds may have a bit more room to be extra flashy without suffering crippling predation costs.  Contrast with, say, rodents (Although poor color vision and vision in general in rodents means they aren't likely to use colorful displays much anyway)",

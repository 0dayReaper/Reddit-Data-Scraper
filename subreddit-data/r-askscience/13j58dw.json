            "comment": "Which one you get depends on the rate of crystallization. Microcline is found in very slow cooling silicic to intermediate plutonic rocks and some metamorphic rocks. Sanidine is the common K-feldspar in fast cooling silicic volcanic rocks. The slower cooling magmas that generate microcline allow for the development of more order within the feldspar\u2019s crystal lattice.",

            "comment": "Usually, an ordered phase has *lower* symmetry than a disordered one, because the ordering breaks some symmetry.\n\nFor example, a liquid is disordered and has full translational symmetry. A crystal is ordered and is symmetric only under translation by an integer number of lattice vectors. Analogous arguments apply to most solid-solid phase transitions, both structural and magnetic ones.\n\nMicrocline and Sanidine both have the chemical formula KAlSi3O8 and derive from the same basic structure. In Sanidine, one Al and three Si atoms are randomly distributed across four crystallographic positions, whereas in Microcline, the Al atom occupies one site and Si atoms occupy the three others. \"Order-disorder\" refers to the (dis-)order of the occupation of those positions.",

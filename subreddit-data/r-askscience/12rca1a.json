    "postText": "I'm asking this question because I found the geography around Parker Ranch, the first cattle ranch in the Hawaiian archipelago, to be very peculiar. \n\nNorth of Parker Ranch is Mt. Kohala which sports a lush forest. The elevation shift could explain the arid region on the other side of the mountain, however, the edge of the forest on the north side of the island is very geometric, suggesting land management as the culprit. A third option could be a mix of a rain shadow + land management but I'm not sure. Further, there could be other factors I'm not thinking about.\n\nThoughts?",

            "comment": "Hi, I'm from a different island on Hawaii and I've driven this road many times. It's absolutely a rain shadow effect.  As you drive through Waimea town from east to west, the weather changes almost instantly from overcast and rainy to clear blue skies.  Here's a [rainfall map](http://rainfall.geography.hawaii.edu/interactivemap.html): five miles east of Waimea, it rains 90 inches a year.  Five miles west, it's 20 inches a year.  By the time you get to the Kohala coast, it's cactus country.  And the Waipio Valley, the extra-green bit north of Waimea, gets like 150 inches a year.\n\nThere's definitely some land management in the area, some of the area east of Waimea is green and rainy but *not* forested, which in Hawaii is a sure sign that somebody's chopping trees, but the dramatic green-to-brown contrast you see in satellite photos is one of the most spectacular demonstrations of the rain shadow effect you'll ever see.",

The rainfall map you linked is very helpful.\n\nZooming out, it seems to be a pattern among other islands that the eastern coasts are more humid than the western-facing ones. Is there a reason that Hawaiian rain shadows tend to be on the western rather than eastern sides of mountains? Is it related to the direction of wind in the region ([global wind map](https://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/surface/level/orthographic=-154.66,24.31,1150)) or is some other system at play?",

The southerly flow you saw yesterday was due to the abnormal frontal system(fronts almost never pass over oahu the way it did, they almost always barely get scraped by a tail during winter months) that was passing over. Today we are seeing westerly winds and will in \u201csea breeze\u201d conditions for the next week as high pressure to the NW dominates the region. Our typical tradewinds i mentioned earlier are typically supplied by a strong high pressure system to NNW  off of California. Hope this helps.",

Likewise the east coast and gulf of Mexico is pretty humid, but the Appalachian mountains will form a barrier. So the weather that reaches the Midwest and southwest will often be chaotic: whatever's leftover past the mountains like stuff that got pushed up to a high altitude and then came back down hundreds of miles later, whatever gets pushed up or down by polar or gulf storms, and whatever's generated by the simple fact of so much flat land being warmed by the sun.\n\nWhen I lived in the Midwest, the joke was if you don't like the weather just wait five minutes. Sometimes you could literally take a long equinox nap and completely miss spring or autumn, just going straight from a winter jacket to shorts in a day, just because a freak weather system comes in and messes with stuff. And living in California was nice and cool until weather had winds arriving from the Northern Nevada desert instead of the ocean, and then it's a dry windy barren hellscape where fires burst out.",

It can cause temperature-inversions, and you can see them with your own eyes.\n\nIn a flat city, the sun rises and warms up the ground &amp; air at the same time. The ground reflects some heat, and also absorbs some which it slowly radiates through the day. Hot air rises, so the warm, ground-level air circulates up. Then there is a steady cycle of rising and falling.\n\nIn a deep valley, there are times of the year when the sun is blocked by the mountains for most of the day. Depending on the angle,  it could be 11am and no sun/heat has reached the ground of the city yet. BUT the air much higher up DOES get sunlight - up by the peaks, everything above the line of that angle is getting warmed up. Now you have a cool air down on the ground, and warm air way up high. And they aren't going to mix or have that circulation cycle happen. That cool air down below isn't budging. \n\nAdd in a city with a lot of motor vehicles...and any smog created now gets trapped in the cool air bubble. Reno doesn't normally have bad smog (or didn't 2007-2013), but if you go up on a hill on a temperature inversion day and look down into the valley... it's like something from a dystopian movie. Just a solid brown haze hovering above it all. The line where the smog stops should be where the two air layers meet - so you get a direct visualization of the inversion!",

It's almost entirely driven by geography and topography. And because of the basin and range topography of the US Southwest, the shift in wind patterns produces really chaotic and localized storms when it reaches the mountains. A forecast calling for 20% chance of rain pretty much guarantees it's going to rain, just probably not your exact neighborhood block.\n\nEdit: You also have the [Sky Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_island) effect created by that topography. Abrupt, steep, tall mountains separated by vast basins and valleys create all sorts of isolated habitats. The mountains do a great job of capturing the low level moisture during the summer and also sit above the snow line for the polar jet stream in winter, so you get desert plains and nearly alpine tundra mountaintops all at once.",

True rainforest isn't good for either crops or cattle grazing, but it is important as watershed for the streams that are diverted over to the dry side.  So that abrupt forest edge (which you can also see in other areas, like Hamakua and Kau) typically marks the shift from wet forest to what was originally mesic forest, with an intermediate amount of rainfall that allows for rain-fed agriculture and grass growth.  \n\nThis is also why native mesic forest is so heavily impacted \u2013 there are a few protected areas, and some occurs in steep gulches, but a lot of it was cleared even before Europeans arrived.",

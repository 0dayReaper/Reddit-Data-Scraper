    "postText": "I've recently learned to scuba dive, and naturally I've been looking up all the places I might be able to dive in the future, and asking experienced divers I know their thoughts about where the most interesting spots to dive with aquatic life are.\n\nI've been surprised to find that freshwater lakes and rivers don't seem to have much in the way of macroscopic biological structures that create habitat, unlike oceans (which have corals, kelp forests, soft-bodied anemones, huge clam beds, seagrass meadows, etc). It also seems that freshwater animals stem from a severely restricted subset of overall aquatic life. Divers have been telling me that the only really interesting stuff to see in freshwater are wrecks. This is wild to me.\n\nI spent a while trying to find out whether there were structurally complex biological underwater environments in the Great Lakes, thinking that massive lakes must surely support lots of interesting variety, but I'm not finding much variety in environments beyond scenes of greyish fish swimming around over relatively flat sediment or rocky bottoms.\n\nI'm confused by this. I know that small ponds and bogs can be full of stuff like rushes and lily pads and duckweed and other things, so I'd expect to see that sort of environment grow larger and more varied with more space in lakes and rivers. With shallower waters (compared to the ocean) and a high ratio of edge-to-area where biomass from land can enter the water to provide nutrients or evolutionary access points, I'd have thought there would be an abundant variety of aquatic plant life, and that you'd see things like kelp forests or lily pad groves or lake-grass meadows; and I know freshwater hydras exist, so I'm surprised there aren't freshwater sessile cnidarians forming beds along lake bottoms. \n\nI've heard the mineral content of freshwater is too low for animals that form hard structures like corals, but there are plenty of soft-bodied structures in the ocean too that don't seem to have developed in freshwater. There are a few microbialites in places like Pavilion Lake, BC, but those seem to exist in lakes that are otherwise relatively low in biological activity.\n\nWhat are some of the factors that prevent these things from evolving in freshwater? Or do they exist plentifully elsewhere, maybe just not at temperate latitudes?",

Most lakes are only thousands of years in age, and rivers are constantly moving and have high rates of sedimentation or erosion. I suspect that in freshwater there's pressure for dispersal and colonization instead of building slow growing, long lasting structures.",

Freshwater habitats are actually super diverse, but yes a lot of this might be in small ponds and not necessarily stuff that\u2019s super engaging to dive with. Maybe it comes down to what people find interesting more than any meaningful ecological question. People want to see the slow turtles, dull colourful fish and boring corals not the super cool water insects. Just like people enjoy looking at lazy lions instead of awesome ants.

            "comment": "Several things come together in this question, so I'm just going to break it down and touch on some individual parts\n\n&gt;I've been surprised to find that freshwater lakes and rivers don't seem to have much in the way of macroscopic biological structures that create habitat, unlike oceans (which have corals, kelp forests, soft-bodied anemones, huge clam beds, seagrass meadows, etc).\n\n&gt;I've heard the mineral content of freshwater is too low for animals that form hard structures like corals, but there are plenty of soft-bodied structures in the ocean too that don't seem to have developed in freshwater. There are a few microbialites in places like Pavilion Lake, BC, but those seem to exist in lakes that are otherwise relatively low in biological activity.\n\nThis is correct, and the main reason for your first question.  Freshwater is significantly lower in dissolved minerals and lower in pH than ocean water, and this means that it's more difficult for animals to form hard shells, and that those hard shells tend to crumble apart after the animals die.  Hard microbialites tend to only form in places that have unusual water chemistry which is toxic to most non-microbial life.  \n\n  The flip side of the erosion I mentioned earlier is that lakes and slow rivers tend to _receive_ a lot of sediment.  As sediment falls to the bottom, it tends to cover up existing organisms.  That reduces communities of sessile bottom dwellers.  This is common in the ocean as well.  There's a whole lot of ocean bottom that's also flattish sediment with gray fish, without much biological structure. \n\nLakes also tend to be relatively short lived bodies, ecologically speaking.  That means lake life doesn't usually have millions of years to build up diversity and complexity (though there are some very notable exceptions).  But the great lakes in particular were all glaciers a few thousand years ago.   Most of the lakes people visit in the USA are human constructed reservoirs that didn't exist even 100 years ago.  \n\n&gt;What are some of the factors that prevent these things from evolving in freshwater? \n\nAnother thing to note is that freshwater taxa are fairly limited compared to saltwater taxa.  Life had to colonize freshwater from saltwater, and not everything made the jump.  \n\n&gt;Or do they exist plentifully elsewhere, maybe just not at temperate latitudes?\n\nFinally, there's more going on in lakes than you might think.  Freshwater fish diversity is sky high...nearly half of all fish species live in freshwater despite the vastly smaller volume of water.  And there are a ton of freshwater plants too.\n\n&gt; I'd have thought there would be an abundant variety of aquatic plant life, and that you'd see things like kelp forests or lily pad groves or lake-grass meadows\n\nThere's no kelp in freshwater, but there are absolutely underwater beds and meadows of plants of various sorts.  I remember one dive I did  in a spring that was absolutely amazing.  Meadows of short grasses, pillars of taller aquatic vegetation.  Not as big as a kelp forest, but then, a spring isn't as big as the ocean.",

As sediment falls to the bottom, it tends to cover up existing organisms.\n\nTo add to a little to this point, if we consider shallow marine environments where some of the more \"structured\" environments OP mentions form (e.g., corals), they specifically are able to thrive in areas with low to zero sediment input (i.e., typically siliciclastic) input. Specifically for corals, delivery of sediment in moderate volumes (like you would expect in your average river or lake) can be a large stressor (e.g., [Rogers &amp; Ramos-Scharr\u00f3n, 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2021.773968/full)), so things like corals would not survive in these environments.",

            "comment": "The vast majority of modern life forms originally evolved in alkali or salty water during the Cambrian explosion.\n\nThe Cambrian explosion happened after the Earth, which was almost completely frozen over, started melting again. We know the entire Earth was frozen due to a geological feature called \"the Great Unconformity\" which is basically about a billion years of missing fossil record that was caused by glaciers carving away the topsoil. So we know that the Earth was covered in a thick layer of ice at one point but we also know that it must have all melted since it's obviously not frozen anymore. Salty water melts faster than fresh water, which means at first the vast majority of liquid water when Earth started melting was extremely salty. The appearance of new biological niches in the form of pools of mineral-rich water that life could easily exploit, led to an explosion of evolution resulting in the appearance of the progenitors to most complex multicellular life including vertebrates and creatures like coral that were able to evolve bony skeletons thanks to the mineral-rich water.\n\nThese animals would have had to separately evolve tolerance for fresh water later on, which means that fresh water life would only represent a smaller subset of organisms than the rest of those original life forms that evolved in mineral-rich water. Fresh water is also considerably more rare than salt water is.\n\nIn my opinion that's why fresh water has less biological structure and diversity than oceans: oceans were the original cradle of life on Earth.\n\nETA: It's worth mentioning though that fresh water environments have more species of certain forms of life like fish. What I'm specifically referring to is a lack of greater biodiversity. For example, there are no species of freshwater coral.",

Headwaters of rivers are typically nutrient poor, but further downstream they become major sinks for nutrients and the interface between rivers and oceans are actually some of the most nutrient rich aquatic environments on the planet because of that transport.\n\nAs others have noted, both in the short term and on the geological timescales freshwater systems are much more dynamic which \"resets\" these environments more often, but sediment loading also tends to be less conductive to the growth of large sedentary structures in freshwater environments. Coral reefs have the advantage of millions more years to become established but also strong ocean currents flush the sediment and keep the corals (and associated microhabitats) from being buried.",

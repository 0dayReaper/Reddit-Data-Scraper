            "comment": "The short summer. Arctic mosquito species eggs can survive being frozen in the winter, then hatch in the spring meltwater pools and grow for a couple of weeks as larvae before becoming the flying adults. No mosquito species can be active in the cold, 15-25 C is a good air temperature zone for them.\n\nPresumably a late hatching mosquito would find little food to eat as a larva (ot already got scoffed by the earlier hatchlings) and few potential mates as an adult, and risk being killed if the cold returns early, so the selection pressure is for them to hatch and grow as early as the weather allows.\n\nIn the tropics there isn\u2019t that seasonality and mosquito activity is spread through the year instead of being concentrated in one or two months.\n\nhttps://research.uarctic.org/news/2015/10/featured-arthropod-aedes-nigripes-diptera-culicidae/\n\nhttps://www.esa.org/blog/2020/08/04/where-are-arctic-mosquitoes-most-abundant-in-greenland-and-why/",

            "comment": "Nesting/breeding grounds. Mosquitoes require shallow, still bodies of fresh water to breed. The further *from equator* you go, the less direct normal sunlight hits the surface, causing ground not to heat up too much and causing more shady spaces where water dries slower. Thus, resulting in lots of puddles, mini-ponds, swamps, bogs, and such.",

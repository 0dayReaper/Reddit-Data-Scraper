As such, the Salinity of the ocean water never actually changes.\n\nSalinity decreases from ice cap melting are where things get interesting,  and how that impacts the thermohaline conveyors which control ocean currents and related nutrient and weather processes.",

The total amount of salt removed from the body of water (if produced through artificial desalination) is so small that it doesn't change the salinity of the body of water.\n\nDesalination for the production of water is a much, much, bigger problem. There is more than just salt in that water, and the brine produced by mass desalination is nasty stuff because it's concentrated. This is going to be a huge problem moving forward if the world tries to use desalination",

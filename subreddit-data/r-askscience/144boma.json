            "comment": "The smoke from these wildfires isn't affecting a particularly large area compared to previous fires in western North America. There have been [much bigger areas of smoke in the recent past](https://wildfiretoday.com/2020/09/17/smoke-and-air-quality-maps-for-september-17-2020/); compare these maps of near-surface smoke for [today](https://i.imgur.com/kQrNc02.png) and for [September 2020](https://wildfiretoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Smoke-forecast-5-am-PDT-Sept-12-2020.jpg). There have been much worse examples in the past, but those plots are only available since 2018 for comparison purposes.\n\nIt's making news headlines due to several factors, including \n\n1. A lot of smoke is remaining near the ground due to the fires being relatively nearby and the weather pattern being relatively cool and stable\n2. it's affecting a very highly populated area, and\n3. that area doesn't typically experience such intense smoke outbreaks.",

            "comment": "California wildfire has to travel a long distance through quite a few mountain ranges before it would ever reach further east, each range with its own micro-climate. I don\u2019t think the northeastern areas have that vast of mountain ranges, giving more of a chance for it to travel through, plus it\u2019s on the coast where wind tends to be more active. \n\nI have a farm in southern Oregon with mountain ranges to the east and west, my area is a bit more flat with valleys. So I get smoke from fires in north California, north Oregon, Washington, etc. when the wind picks up and sends it between the mountains. When these fires are further east/west instead of north/south the smoke tends to dissipate before it reaches me.",

    "postText": "Mandarinfish and related species are the only vertebrates known to have blue pigment.\n\nWhat is the blue pigment in them? like the chemical formula and all that.\n\nOther blue pigments include the blue blood of mollusks and crustaceans due to copper instead of iron but vertebrates have red blood so that's not it.\n\nAnother way blue chemicals form is by combining a pigment of a different color and a protein like the blue lobster or the blue starfish but I didn't read anywhere that this fish does it like that.",

Someone needs to follow that study up!",

Based on these things the authors suggest it was a proper pigment, and based on that statement someone else wrote somewhere that they had blue pigment.\n\nHonestly I would like to see independent confirmation and characterization of the specific molecule, but the evidence they present is pretty suggestive of an actual blue pigment.\n\nThis is typical of scientific knowledge on the boundaries of what has been researched.  You have evidence, but not exhaustive documentation.",

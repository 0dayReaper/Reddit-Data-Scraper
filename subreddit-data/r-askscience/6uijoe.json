            "comment": "Ok, this will likely get buried, but I'll give an explanation.\n\nAfter you ingest (swallow) water, it goes to your stomach. There, it is slowly released to your small intestine to be absorbed and pass to your bloodstream.\nIt takes water between 10 and 40 minutes to pass to your small intestine and be absorbed. The speed of this depends on how much water, the temperature (cold water will be released slower), if there is something else in the stomach, etc.\nBut, in general, it doesn't matter whether you chug a bottle of water down in 10 seconds or slowly sip it in 10 minutes. It will all end up in your bloodstream in about the same time.\n\nThe only thing that can make a difference is whether you vomit the water that you are ingesting. You stomach vomits its contents in response to a series of things (whether it senses that something you ate may be rotten or dangerous, whether there is a bad smell, etc), and one of those things that the stomach takes into account is how full it is. So ingesting water in small sips can help avoid vomiting, and that is what's recommended when for example children have gastroenteritis. But if you don't vomit the water that you swallow, it doesn't matter whether you swallowed it in 10 seconds or 10 minutes.\n\nEdit: Wow, thanks for all the upvotes. Turns out it didn't get buried after all! This is 1/4 of my total karma right there! Glad you liked it!\n\nEdit2: it's actually not clear whether cold water will be released (and thus absorbed) slower. As someone pointed out below, studies on this seem to be contradictory.\n",

But it's not that simple once you add food and hunger to the equation.\nFirst, the food you are eating is likely warmer than your body, so when mixed with the cold water, both will countereffect each other.\nAnd, more importantly, how much you want to eat doesn't only depend on how fast you fill up your stomach. It depends partly on how your body interprets what it is eating/drinking. It is a very complex process that involves taste; your brain; the fat, protein, and starch content of what you eat; the spiciness of the food, what foods are available, etc. It's very hard to predict whether drinking cold or hot water is going to make you eat more or less without actually studying in different conditions.\n\nEdit: it turns out that it's not even clear that cold water takes longer to pass. Some studies show that cold water at 4C (close to ice temperature) can pass faster than water at 20C (at room temp).",

[...] TRPV1, which can also be stimulated with heat, protons and physical abrasion, permits cations to pass through the cell membrane when activated. The resulting depolarization of the neuron stimulates it to signal the brain. By binding to the TRPV1 receptor, the capsaicin molecule produces similar sensations to those of excessive heat or abrasive damage, explaining why the spiciness of capsaicin is described as a burning sensation.\n&gt;\n&gt; - Wikipedia\n\nSo as an extension of this, you can picture it having a similar effect in the stomach - one of the factors in how much Ghrelin your stomach secretes is based on stretch receptors, which I could hypothesize might be also activated by capsaicin. From what I can see, the entire lifecycle of ghrelin secretion, use, and destruction isn't well understood, so that's just a supposition, but certainly there is some clinical evidence that consuming foods that contain capsaicin reduces total meal size and calories vs non-spicy food.",

An excess of water is just passed through with electrolytes (because we effectively cannot store extra), which is the reason we need to drink at regular intervals whether we \"chug or sip\". You can't drink your whole 3 liters at once every day, but that's kind of an extreme anyway.",

Your body will work to keep a stable overall temperature and burns calories to do such. \n\nBut someone with more medical knowledge should be able to help with the actual retention of fluid in the stomach. I suspect it's just an increase in heat produced to compensate and the water flows the same no matter what temperature. \n\nEdit: I was incorrect on water retention. Check the rest of the comments for a good explanation.",

If we only look at the energy required to heat the water, and assume ice-cold water is 0 degrees, it'll take 37 calories to heat 1 litre to body temperature. A quick google search reveals that 1lb of body fat contains about 3500 calories of energy, which requires you to drink a little under 100 litre of ice-cold water to burn.",

Unless you're doing some sort of energy storage (chemical or potential), you can approximate everything as ending up as heat. Your laptop calculating pi --&gt; 150 watts in, 150 watts out as heat. A closer example might be your blender; you're warming up the liquid in the blender by running it. There's a split of some ratio between heat that is vented out by the fan, but a large portion of that is going directly into the liquid. Blendtec used to have an example of being able to make hot soup using their blender, which I thought was a very creative marketing turn-around of what I'd consider a weakness.",

In the same way, your body doesn't directly turn fat/sugar into heat just for kicks, it turns it into chemical energy that you use to sit and walk and talk and breathe and all the other things you do on a daily basis (remember something called ATP from high school?). Heat is, like in your car, a byproduct that comes of using this energy. \n\nThis also explains why you shiver when you're cold, your body has realized it needs to be warmer to maintain the optimal internal environment to keep you alive so it initiates a useless body motion in order to generate heat. But in no way can this energy conversion be 100% efficient since your body needs to use some of the input energy to do the shivering so you'll never get all of it out as heat. ",

If those waste products are are not fully oxidized then there is wasted energy.  In your wood cutting example (which is not related to the example in the OP), the chemical energy stored in your fat is converted to kinetic energy in the axe with [about a 20% efficiency](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/46788/how-efficient-is-the-human-body) [(give or take a lot)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_equivalent).  Some processes will be less efficient than others (more heat and less motion), and some processes will be just as efficient, but keep the majority of the kinetic energy internal where the motion will decay over time into heat.  But in the long run, no, not 100% efficient at turning fat into heat.",

If you sip two liters of water over two hours your body will lower production of vasopressin/ADH to allow excess water to clear as required. \n\nIf you chug that same quantity in one minute your body will shut down production of antidiuretic hormones all together as plasma concentration drops through the floor. You will then overshoot ideal osmolality and become slightly dehydrated, because your kidneys can make very dilute urine astoundingly fast.\n\nIt's the same concept as eating a lot of sugar, your body can create the hormones to bring you back to \"normal\" but resources are wasted in the process and extremes are not fully accounted for.",

While absorption time will always be the same, if you chug a 500ml water bottle, you will almost certainly have to urinate quickly after said drink. I always drink in small sips throughout the day, as if I just *slam* the water bottle, too for lack of a better term \"get it in me\" I know I will have to urinate several times in the next following few hours or so. Your much better off to take small sips through out the day, and of course depending ok your ambient temperature, physical exertion and humidity etc ",

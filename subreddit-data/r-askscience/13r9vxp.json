A substantial portion of fertilized eggs are not viable. In many cases that is due to small mutations in the cell. The difference is, you never hear about it -- you don't even realize an egg was fertilized because the vast majority of cases where a newly formed zygote had genetic damage fail immediately and never result in a pregnancy.",

It appears more male embryos die early on but more female embryos start dieing from week 1-15 which alters the sex ratio of live births. There is an interesting hypothesis that its related to skewed x inactivated making the female embryo seem more foreign to the moms body thus more likely to miscarry. Its also interesting that male embryos grow more quickly which could reduce their likelihood of implanting in the endometrium at the most ideal time. Female embryos growing more slowly may have some reduction in how many are kept in ivf.",

It was days of fist sized clots, gushing blood, and significant cramping. I am also a healthcare provider who treats pregnant women and I have treated many early miscarriages that were very similar. To be clear: *you are wrong.*\n\nFor most women, the changes are significant. Not only nausea and vomiting, but extreme fatigue, food aversions, and breast tenderness, starting at 4-5 weeks for most women. Quit talking out your ass and trying to mansplain something you know nothing about, and are completely wrong about.",

It just sounded so misogynistic and I honestly thought no one who had ever been even 6 weeks pregnant and miscarried could think that most women somehow \"missed\" the associated changes or think they were \"just sick.\" To me that's pretty insulting, like you're saying most women are idiots who just can't figure out what could be causing these significant changes in their bodies or put two and two together with a late period. \n\nQuestion - can you honestly say your miscarriages were *indistinguishable* from a regular period? Did you honestly not know you were pregnant before you missed *two periods* (10 weeks along)? \n\nAgain, a 7 week pregnancy is a golf ball sized tissue ball and a grapefruit size blood clot. None of my miscarriages, all before 7.5 weeks, were remotely like a period... and I've had very heavy periods due to my IUD. I've admitted women to the hospital for hemorrhage with 6 week miscarriages. It's certainly possible someone could miss it, and I'm sure occasionally people have. But I stand by my statement that it is absolutely not common to have no clue that your miscarriage is different than a normal period.",

How many eggs over the previous 7 years were never viable?",

Miscarriage is when an embryo is lost after implantation (not all are detected; if you\u2019re \u201clate\u201d that might actually be a very early miscarriage). Add those together and it\u2019s almost certainly more than half of all conceptions ending in spontaneous termination, maybe closer to 2/3rds. 90% is higher than estimates I\u2019ve seen but my information is quite old so maybe a higher number is more accurate.",

With that analogy, I\u2019d say it\u2019s like someone kept building that house out of control until it eventually starts causing problems for the neighbors, usually after the house has spawned mini copies of itself spread all throughout the neighborhood, all growing out of control.

In some cases there are other houses that need repairs and upkeep, but the houses growing out of control use up all the building materials so the neighbor\u2019s houses fall into disrepair. In some cases the houses can spawn toxic gas that starts killing off the neighbors.",

So it no longer does whatever job it was supposed to be doing, it just keeps make more and more of itself. And all it's offspring are born with this glitch of being stuck in the reproduction phase too. So then you wind up with a clump/ tumor of cells that are all just replicating themselves to create more broken cells that will only reproduce, instead of doing a useful job. \n\n...kinda like Tribbles, who are born pregnant, and before you know it have overrun an entire ship.",

(faulty in ways that cause it to mutate more)\n\nNot exactly.\n\n\"Cancer\" is our word for cells that reproduce in an uncontrolled fashion. There is no requirement that cancer cells have multiple mutations. But our bodies have multiple mechanisms to prevent out-of-control cell growth. A cell that mutates so the telomere- mediated cell death no longer occurs may start growing, then form a huge clump of cells without any blood supply. Then they may all die due to lack of oxygen. So maybe the tumor doesn't really get going until it acquires a second mutation allowing it to be perfused with blood vessels.\n\nThat isn't the only story, there are numerous ways in which a cell may need to change in order to become a \"successful\" cancer. And this is why most malignant cancers have numerous mutations. But it isn't part of the definition of \"cancer\".",

Someone correct me if wrong) and destroy the cell (too old, sick, whatever). If one of those notifications malfunctions, you're okay as long as the other one is still working. When both malfunction, you get cancer. The Prius's having a gas pedal that wouldn't stop is bad, but if your brake still works, then at least you won't crash.

Secondly, the change to white hairs (\"gray\" hair is normally just a mix of some white and some colored hairs) isn't normally a mutation. Instead, it is related to the same process of limited cell reproduction that protects against cancer. To a rough approximation, there are stem cells that create the melanocyte cells that give color to the hair and the melanocytes die off and keep needing to be replaced. After a certain number of re-creations, the stem cells stop dividing and stop creating new melanocytes. So it's anti-cancer limits on cell reproduction that produce gray hair, not a mutation. (The full story is more complex: environment, nutrition, and even stress can also play a role.)\n\nIt IS possible for parents to have a mutation which they pass on to their children and which is not severe enough to prevent the children from being born and growing to live normal lives. Usually these mutations are mildly harmful, but sometimes they are actually an advantage. This is the entire basis of evolution!",

Having gray hair requires that some of your cells producing hair have it and other don't have it, which you can't have if your initial cell has it. \n\nAlso, mutations that cause albinism also cause many other problems because the same enzyme that produces melanin are used for other things, so it reduces the probability that someone has children, so it's selected against by evolution.",

            "comment": "You're not wrong that an offspring's DNA is just a copy of a portion of each parents' DNA, but the *structure* of that DNA changes and has a huge impact on cell development.\n\nWhen an embryo is created, it is a combination of the egg and sperm, each of which are completely different cells from the others in the parents' body due to DNA recombination in meiosis. This is a very different process from typical cell division in the body, which goes through a replication process called mitosis.\n\nOnce the parents' DNA joins to form the embryo, cells start to replicate through a process called mitosis, which is essentially creating a copy of a copy. The difference in these early stages is that the cells do not have a particular role in the body yet. These are called pluripotent stem cells. During each division, pluripotent stem cells become more specialized for a role in the body. I don't know exactly how their mitosis differs from, say, a regular skin cell, but the gene expression in the new cells are controlled in such a way that the cell now might become a *neural* stem cell, or a *dental pulp* stem cell. Each of these cells still has the same DNA, but their gene expression is regulated by their **epigenome**, which basically refers to how the DNA is packed and what genes are available to express. \n\nEach new cell in the embryo has an epigenome that is more and more specific for the role it will play in the body, so they are not exact copies. Over time, new cells eventually reach their epigenome end goal, which may mean they are a very specialized cell, such as a dendritic cell, or one that produces the keratin for your fingernails. \n\nOnce fully specialized, their goal is to perfectly replicate periodically, but they don't. The process of mitosis is imperfect, so there may be an uncaught mutation, or the epigenome may roll a section of the DNA slightly differently. This causes future copies to favor an expression of different genes, leading to a decline in health as cells lose the ability to work together properly. \n\nHere's a video where Andrew Huberman and David Sinclair, a leading researcher on aging, discuss this process in more detail. The main discussion of epigenetics happens from 7:50-16:00\n\nhttps://youtu.be/n9IxomBusuw",

                    "comment": "This is the right answer. The difference is in the epigenome, which controls which genes get expressed. While your DNA is surprisingly stable (DNA mutations aren't as common as people suppose), the machinery that surrounds it such as methylation(which is what controls which part of the DNA is actually able to be opened up and read) breaks down. Eventually, the cell stops producing the correct proteins for its function and stops being useful. \n\nThey become senescent cells, which besides being useless and taking up resources while not contributing anything, produce compounds to keep themselves as inactive as possible that also leak into other cells, such as CD38, which causes NAD production to decline. NAD is the a primary electron transport molecule responsible for the basic metabolism of the cell, and whin it declines, everything else declines with it. \n\nDNA mutations do happen, and can lead to cancer, but this isn't what causes the general degradation of health that happens with age. \n\nTelomeres do shorten, and may impose something of a hard limit, but 99.99% of people get nowhere close to that.",

The little that does occur is why there is genetic drift over generations. \n\nTelomere length is only a part of aging, and it is possible to extend them again. The germ line cells can do this.

These things do play a role in cellular aging, but there\u2019s a lot of other stuff at play too, including \u201cepigenetic\u201d modifications to the DNA and overall changes to the cell outside of the DNA. These things are reversible and lots of scientists are working on ways of reversing them as medical treatments.\n\nThe Yamanaka factors are the prime example of how to reset cells to a younger state without touching the DNA sequence. They are dangerous, however, because if you supply the Yamanaka factors for too long, the aged cells revert all to early-stage stem cells. And early-stage stem cells in the adult body are very malleable and tend to become cancerous.\n\nInfo about Yamanaka factors here (google will yield more info about how \u201cpartial cellular reprogramming\u201d is being applied to aging):\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell",

After enough divisons, the cell and its descendants are unable to replicate. In humans, this is around 30-50 divisions. Telomeres, which exist at the ends of the DNA strand, are there to prevent the DNA shortening from cutting into genes important for the cell\u2019s survival. Of course, the telomeres don\u2019t last forever. If you compare a 50 year old person to their 3 year old counterpart, you\u2019ll find the average telomere length to be shorter in the former. Khan Academy has a great [article](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/dna-as-the-genetic-material/dna-replication/a/telomeres-telomerase) explaining this mechanism.\n\nTLDR: Your cells are programmed with a limited number of divisions.",

            "comment": "This is a very good question, and unfortunately every answer in the top ~25 comments is wrong. Citing mutations is completely incorrect, because the whole reason any of us exist in our current form is due to the accumulation of billions of mutations in our respective germlines, tracing all the way back to the abiogenesis of living cells. Germline mutations are not the source of aging, or else multicellular life would have never existed past. Every one of the trillions of multicellular organisms which have inherited mutations have done so at a biological age of zero, and it is well-established (and has been for decades) that one of the fundamental aspects that defines multicellular life is the separation of tissue lineages into an immortal germline and an aging (sometimes referred to as \u201cclock-bound\u201d) soma.\n\nThis is a concise overview of the conceptual framework of rejuvenation, from a study published in *Science* a year and a half ago. Pay close attention to the fact that we very much *do not* know what exactly is going on, and that alone disproves all the answers in here which claim to know the mechanistic source of germline rejuvenation.\n\n&gt;\tEarly embryogenesis, where we observed a rejuvenation period, is also accompanied by other molecular changes in preparation for organismal life, such as a gradual extension of telomeres (54), waves of global demethylation and methylation (55), transition from the use of maternal gene products to those of the embryo, inactivation of chromosome X, and development of monoallelic gene expression (56). Rejuvenation should also involve a decrease in molecular damage and other deleterious age-related changes that accumulate in the parental germ line (57, 58).\n\nhttps://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abg6082",

            "comment": "Telomeres, mutations, and methylation.  \n\nEvery copy can make minor errors.  This is where mutations come from.  Maybe benign, maybe not.\n\nTelomeres are tassles at the end of a strand if DNA.  Replication always truncates the last codon, so telomeres absorb that.  Eventually, you run out of telomeres, and start destroying the DNA at the end of the strand.\n\nBesides telomere depletion, there\u2019s also DNA methylation.  Basically, genes get turned off by cross-linking DNA.  Over time, this can accumulate into a cell being \u201csenescent\u201d.\n\nA senescent cell keeps doing what it can, but replication, repair, adaptation, etc all gets impaired.  Injuries take longer to recover from, which leads to more scar tissue instead of proper tissue, etc.\n\nIf you made telomeres always regenerate, you\u2019d be more prone to cancer.  If you made methylation never happen, then cells could not adapt to environmental changes, and also more prone to cancer.\n\nSome anti-aging research is about one-time resets of senescent cells, or even recycling senescent cells, and one-time repletion of telomeres.\n\nIt seems there\u2019s probably more to aging than these things, but these are some of the first, most obvious things to address before going further down the rabbit hole.",

Lets think about this in a fashion that ignores the biology texts, and think about it in terms of printing, or mould making. \n\n When a typeset or mould for a part is made new, it features crisp, clean edges, smooth, freshly machined and finished surfaces, all the little details are perfect in those letters, or those mould elements. \n\n However, over time, those edges wear and the details become less high definition. This means that the letters that typeset can print become fluffier at the edges, the parts made by the mould become less accurate to the original design. \n\n The biological version is no different in that regard, except the mechanisms of the wear and tear are different, of course. In cells, more specifically, DNA there is something called telomerase, and it forms on the ends of the DNA molecules, helping keep the strands of DNA from unravelling. In the young, these telomerase formations are large and do a great job of keeping the DNA information intact in its \"original\" format. Those telomerase formations found on older persons DNA are shorter though, and don't do as good of a job of keeping the DNA in good order, meaning cell copying becomes less high def as time goes on.",

They measure the wavelength of incoming photons reflected off of the surface of objects in the environment and expand/contract or change their internal chemical composition to force themselves to match the wavelengths they receive. \n\nAbsolutely amazing animal ability.",

They can match patterns pretty well. \n\nI once saw a group of cuttlefish in a tank at an aquarium playing what I can only assume to be the cephalopod version of peekaboo. \n\nOne of them would blend in with the background and slowly sneak up on another. When they got close, they would suddenly start flashing bright orange, startling the unsuspecting cuttlefish and sending it fleeing.",

In octopus, they have a distributed neuronal network throughout their body and photosensitive sensor cells that gather information to copy and display back.

I think that their eyes probably do play some role in the whole process, but they can't see in color, so the possibilities there are extremely limited necessarily.",

If they did use it for stealth as the primary driver of the adaptation, you'd expect to see a much stronger response, (edit) and their chromatophores cannot biomechanically produce the range of colors needed to match them to their environment. \n\nAdded that last line for accuracy and clarity.",

Even 'colorblind' people aren't really 'colorblind' (outside of a few very rare cases), it's that the colors they see compared to the 'normal' human vision are skewed in different ways.  They still see color, just not in the same way as everyone else, and some colors are merged together, or shifted.\n\nFor animals it's vastly more complicated as we can't ask them, and not all color perception has to do with the eyes.\n\nAnimals like octopus can 'see' with their skin, the chromatophores respond to their surroundings *without* brain input, so looking at what the eyes of an octopus see is potentially leading investigations down the wrong (or an incomplete) track.\n\n-\thttps://www.sciencenews.org/article/octopuses-can-see-their-skin  \n-\thttps://oceanbites.org/can-octopuses-see-with-their-skin/\n\n&gt;To test if octopods are capable of sensing light with their skin, the scientists examined the skin of the California two-spot octopus (*Octopus binaculoides*). When the scientists placed pieces of octopus skin under bright lights, the chromatophores expanded, proving that the chromatophores were capable of responding to light without any input from the brain or eyes. \n\n&gt;Next the scientists  looked for opsin activity in the skin, comparing the opsins found there to the opsins in the octopus\u2019s eyes to compare how they were functioning and to look for differences in their expression. They found the exact same types of opsins present in octopus eyes expressed in their skin, along with some other genes crucial to opsin-based light reception. This suggests that skin may be \u201cseeing\u201d in a similar way to eyes. \n\n&gt;Finally, the scientists examined what type of light octopus skin could sense. They found that the biggest chromatophore growth lined up perfectly with the wavelengths octopus opsins are most sensitive to. This shows how chromatophores and opsins work together to allow octopuses to sense light and change color with only their skin.\n\nThe main eyes may be 'colorblind' but their skin is not, and, in essence, they're covered in thousands of little eyes.\n\nTheir skin changes are autonomous, working without direct brain control, but, when necessary, the octopus can override the autonomous process and make decisions about that patterns/colors to display.\n\nThis general system is likely similar in other color changing animals.",

When you cannot see different colors but different wavelenghts do aberrate differently (or you can make your eye 'find' certain aberrations) then that means the the way you see objects changes depending on the color they have. Something red can have a different 'outline' or 'blurriness' around it depending how you look at it than something blue while BOTH will be perceived equally colorless. I used the term 'shapes' to simplify this effect a bit, if you want to know what chromatic aberration is then you best look at some example pictures (and just imagine them all to be greyscale).",

I understand chromatic aberration. \n\nI think you are misunderstanding how this works. The chromatic aberration separates the wavelengths (like a prism) which then fall on light receptors. Any given region of these receptors *only* every gets hit with certain wavelengths. One region receives red, another blue. In this way the octopus measures how much of any color is present and it\u2019s brain then decodes this information.\n\nThe parts and process are different than for us with our specialized color cells, but the octopus is seeing color. They aren\u2019t experiencing chromatic aberration like we do when we see it in a photo or video game.",

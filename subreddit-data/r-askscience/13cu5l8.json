In the room you will still feel a force pointing outwards and can clearly determine if the room is rotating. Why is the rotation reference frame special in that way? By pure definition it's not accelerated, shouldn't it be an inertial frame?\n\nThere is mach's theorem that says you can only detect relative rotation, i.e. rotation relatively to the rest of the universe. That would at least take away the absolute reference.",

Acceleration is described as a change in velocity, and rotating objects' velocity is changing (even if it's not speeding up, the direction is changing), so it is not an inertial frame.",

The idea that a rotating object in a stationary universe is indistinguishable from a stationary object in a rotating universe is known as Mach's principle, and it's not known whether this principle is something we should hold to be true or not. \n\nThere is some evidence of the principle in general relativity: if you have a rotating shell of matter, then spacetime inside the shell rotates along with the shell, which produces Coriolis and centrifugal forces like you'd expect to see for a rotating object. \n\nHowever, we can also create solutions for a rotating universe in general relativity that do *not* have Mach's principle, such as G\u00f6del's rotating universe. Mach's principle, then, isn't built into general relativity, and it might not hold for our universe. Conversely, we know G\u00f6del's rotating universe isn't physically realistic, so maybe for a physically realistic universe, the principle would hold. We just don't know.\n\nThere have been attempts to make alternatives to general relativity that always satisfy Mach's principle, but general relativity has so far passed every experimental test we've thrown at it, so proving any alternative theory would be extremely difficult.",

The idea is that if the universe is rotating around you, then some physical law should cause a centrifugal force to appear.\n\nWhy should we expect Mach's principle to apply? Well, maybe we shouldn't, it's certainly not an explicit requirement in our theories, but one reason is that relativity is, well, relative. Classical mechanics doesn't have absolute speed - the speed of an object may be measured differently by different observers. However, it does have absolute space and absolute time - every observer agrees about the distance between two points in space, and the duration between two points in time. Special relativity changes this, and we have only relative space and relative time, and different observers can measure different values for lengths and durations. Special relativity still has absolute acceleration, though, and it's always possible to tell when you're accelerating. However, general relativity makes even this relative to some extent, because on a local scale, being stationary in a curved spacetime feels the same as accelerating in a flat spacetime. Imagine being in a box, floating in space. You feel no acceleration. Then, suppose a massive object pops into existence directly underneath the box. You now feel a force pushing you towards the bottom of the box, as if the box were being accelerated upwards. Why should this be? Why the should the presence of a large mass outside the box affect the motion of objects inside the box? This is the core statement of Mach's principle: massive objects out there affect inertia over here.\n\nThe idea with rotation, then, is that perhaps it should follow the same principle. In the same way that the presence of large mass creates the feeling of acceleration, perhaps the motion of large masses could create the feeling of rotation. Then rotation would be placed on the same relative footing as speed, space, time, and acceleration.\n\nIt's more of a philosophical point than a physics argument, but there's a certain elegance to it, I think. That said, it's not a requirement, and it might turn out that Mach's principle is wrong, and there really is such a thing as absolute rotation.",

If an object is aligned perfectly on the axis of rotation of a (rotating) universe, it won't be obvious that external objects are rotating about the object. However unless that object is purely rigid and lacks means of sensing physical, it would be possible to detect acceleration of the parts of that object.\n\nAlso, one could attach a laser-based fiber optic ring gyroscope. A suite of three orthogonally-oriented detectors can determine rotation. That's because the frequency of the light emitted by each laser is the same. However, each loop experiencing rotation will have a Doppler shift to the laser frequency based on the rotation rate. There are more details I could get into, even including the use of oppositely oriented fiber optic loops, but that takes too much time.",

            "comment": "Not sure why other commenters are baffled that you have this question. It\u2019s a great question that was even posed by Newton (look up rotating bucket).\n\nYou are probably wondering how absolute rotation can be defined in an empty space if we can only ever define relative motion between objects. I will show now that there\u2019s an objective way to tell rotation even when there are no external objects to reference.\n\nSuppose you find yourself floating in total empty space. No stars, planets, anything around you. You are holding a number of balls which you can play with. You release the balls around you without pushing them. They just stay where they are, for example, the one in front of your nose stays in front of your nose without moving relative to the nose. In this case, we can say that you are in an \u201cinertial frame of reference\u201d.\n\nYou look in the distance and see a faint thing moving relative to you at constant velocity. Squinting, you see that it\u2019s another person holding a number of balls, doing the same experiment as you. From her perspective, her released balls also don\u2019t move relative to her. She is also in an \u201cinertial frame of reference\u201d.\n\nIt turns out that any observer travelling at constant velocity relative to an inertial frame (you, for example) is also in an inertial frame. It\u2019s just as good to say that she\u2019s stationary while you\u2019re moving, as it is to say that you\u2019re stationary and she\u2019s moving. It is in this sense that people say motion is relative.\n\nNow suppose it\u2019s a new day, and you again find yourself in empty space with some balls. You release them, and they all start moving away from you at an ever increasing speed. You conclude that there\u2019s a force in the universe that pulls all the balls away from you. That\u2019s a totally valid description from your perspective, a non-inertial frame of reference.\n\nYou again see a faint figure in the distance. This time she\u2019s encircling you, round and round. When she releases balls in front of her, they seem to stay with her, without moving away from her. From her perspective, she\u2019s in an inertial frame of reference, while you\u2019re the one rotating, and there\u2019s no mysterious cosmic force pulling balls away from you. That\u2019s also a totally valid description.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in a non-inertial frame, with some mysterious force pushing and tugging the balls, it\u2019s always possible to shift your perspective to one in which you\u2019re the one rotating/accelerating, and you don\u2019t need mysterious forces to explain the motion of the balls, i.e. an inertial frame. Although both descriptions of the balls\u2019 motion are equally valid, the latter is often much simpler, so physicists prefer using inertial frames by default.\n\nThe upshot is that the objective way to tell if you\u2019re in an inertial frame in total empty space is to release balls around you and see if they get pushed around mysteriously. If they are, either it\u2019s possible to shift perspective into an inertial frame (any other frame at constant velocity from this inertial frame will be just as good a choice), or there really are mysterious forces abound.",

            "comment": "Think of it differently. Your sense of motion arises from interactions of multiple body parts, down to the atoms. Each of these parts DOES have a different velocity when you are rotating. To begin with, each of them is experiencing curved motion around the room's axis of rotation. Curved motion, at least in a non-accelerated reference frame, requires acceleration towards the center of curvature. Furthermore, each atom has a different radius of curvature around the room's axis of rotation. This even produces differential accelerations. Between the body trying to maintain cohesion and forces acting upon its parts, including fluids in the ear and proprioreceptive nerves in your body detecting distorting forces. So, you have changes that can be detected and then interpreted as rotation.",

            "comment": "&gt; There is no external force acting.\n\nRotating objects have *internal forces*. \n\nImagine that you ball up a short length of heavy rope and release it in outer space. It will tend to stay balled up.\n\nNow imagine you ball up that rope, and give it a bit of a spin, and release it while it's rotating. At the moment of release, different parts of the rope will be moving in different directions, so the distance between the different parts of the rope will increase over time. Eventually, the distance between parts of the rope will equal the length of that section of the rope, creating a tension force that pulls the rope taut.\n\nIn order to remain in the same shape, an object in a rotating reference frame (or a rotating object in an inertial frame) must have internal forces to keep it in that shape. A ball of rope lacks those internal forces, so it changes shape. A straight, taut length of rope rotating around its midpoint has those forces, so it retains that shape.\n\n(If you prefer, instead of a length of heavy rope, you can instead to the above thought experiment using [two spheres attached by a string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_rotation#Rotating_spheres).)\n\nRotating reference frames are not inertial because every point except the pivot point in that reference frame is undergoing acceleration. The acceleration vector at each point is directed toward the pivot point.\n\n&gt; There is mach's theorem that says you can only detect relative rotation\n\nNo, that's roughly the opposite of what Mach's conjecture states. Mach's conjecture was not that you can only detect relative rotation, but that all *local* rotation-free reference frames will have the same rotational velocity vector as global, galactic, or universal rotation-free reference frames. If you stand still, your arms will tend to fall by your side (local non-rotation, as evidenced by zero centripetal force) and the stars in the sky won't spin (universal non-rotation). If you spin your body, your arms will tend to fly outward (local rotation) and the stars in the sky will spin (global rotation). Mach's conjecture is that this equality between coinciding local and universal rotation is necessary, and will occur anywhere in the universe. In other words, rotation is [absolute, not relative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_rotation).",

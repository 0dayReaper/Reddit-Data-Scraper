            "comment": "Normally, chromosomes have two sister chromatids, one original and one copy. However, in some rare cases, chromosomes may have three or more sister chromatids due to errors in DNA replication or recombination. These are called polytene chromosomes or polytene chromatids. Polytene chromosomes are usually found in certain tissues of some insects, such as the salivary glands of fruit flies. They are thought to be a way of increasing gene expression and protein synthesis in these cells.\n\nhttps://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Chromatid",

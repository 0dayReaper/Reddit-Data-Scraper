    "postText": "today we had a virology lecture and one of the symptoms of the infection was Arthralgia the professor explained that this joint pain is due to accumulation of immune complex or antibodies in the joints?  I need a further explanation but I didn't find articles or books that give more answers especially to WHY they accumulate in the joints and not another location \ndo you have any source suggestions ( english or french )\n**excuse my words if they aren't scientifically accurate as I do my studies in french",

            "comment": "It's because of the way the blood vessels turn. I learned about this in immunology and don't remember the correct terms for it but blood vessels in the kidneys and joints curve more which creates turbulence that makes it easier for immune complexes to collect on the sides of the vessels. Like the other commentor said, it can happen anywhere it is just more likely in regions with more turbulence particularly kidneys and joints. This is why in lupus, for instance, which is driven by immune complex formation, the major symptoms are arthritis and kidney disease.",

There is infection mediated lung capillary damage, kidney damage, skin damage, etc all from immune complex deposition which can lead to unchecked immune responses. Joints don\u2019t need much deposition though to cause pain which is why this is such a common area, while you really need a substantial accumulation for significant kidney damage for example.\n\nOne example is post strep/staph glomerulonephrits. \n\n Not all autoimmunity has anything to do with immune complexes though. Crohns and UC cause arthritis and other symptoms through direct cell mediated attack on tissues outside the GI tract .",

The joints have true complex inflammation just as the gut does with neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, etc. it\u2019s of course not fully understood why this happens but the joints and the gut have similar active immune attack from the same underlying disease process. There may be some molecular mimicry with gut bacteria going on as well in non gut tissues. \n\ni",

            "comment": "It\u2019s nothing specifically to do with the infection, and everything to do with your lymphatic system, which basically has the job of cleaning up all the trash and sending it back to your heart to get flushed out by liver/kidneys \n\nAs I recently learned (as a result of an unfortunate personal/medical experience), the high school health class \u201cheart-&gt;arteries-&gt;capillaries-&gt;veins\u201d model of blood flow is significantly flawed by omission. \n\nAbout 15% of the fluid that enters your capillaries does not make it to your veins, but rather disperses among your cells and sits there.  Your lymphatic system exists to provide an exit for that fluid, along with other byproducts of your body, including white blood cells, antibodies and the viral/bacterial/etc stuff. \n\nLymphatic capillaries collect the liquid and byproducts, which feed into lymph vessels and meet in junctions that are also collection areas which are your lymph nodes. The nodes and other bits of your lymphatic system (spleen, tonsils, thymus) are responsible for conveying some types of white blood cells from your marrow, as well as activating them against pathogens and storing. The \u201ccollection\u201d areas act to filter, and provide convenient areas for white blood cells and antibodies to \u201cgang up\u201d and beat the crap out of viruses, bacteria, etc.\n\nNodes happen to be mostly located near joints and major muscles. The reason for this is that for your lymphatic system, there\u2019s no \u201cheart\u201d to circulate things. Instead, your muscle action works to squeeze things along, and it turns out that the nodes being near your joints makes for convenient pumping action, which eventually pushes all that immune system gunk (aka lymph) back to your circulatory system via the big veins under your clavicle of all places. This allows the \u201ctrash\u201d to drain back to your heart, where it gets pumped back into your bloodstream and eventually filtered out by liver and kidneys. \n\nWhen you have an infection, and your immune system is highly active, there\u2019s a lot more lymphocytes and pathogens cruising around in your tissues and getting drawn into the lymphatic vessels, so your lymph nodes swell up with the excess, stuff gets inflamed and the swelling causes pain, which as we just saw happens to be most concentrated around your joint areas, because that\u2019s where it collects in the nodes. This is also why you can sometimes tell that you are sick, when your nodes are puffed up and the immune system is working hard.\n\nThe muscle pumping action is also one reason why moderate exercise is good for your immune system, and being totally sedentary when you\u2019re sick actually leaves you feeling worse. Although in some cases, you want things to collect where your immune system can fight them off, moving your body around a little bit can help move things along so your body can start filtering and cleaning things out.\n\nToo me it seems like a bit of a bizzare arrangement - a great example of how evolution often just favors getting the job done reliably and not necessarily things being well designed/elegant/efficient.",

            "comment": "It's deadly for a few reasons.\n\nFirstly,  the virus goes through muscle tissue and then travels through the central nervous system.  The CNS is called \"immune privileged\" in that it is essentially hidden from your own immune system.  This protects vital tissues, like the brain, from inflammation and cell damage that an immune response can cause.  So because of this, an infection in it does not always cause the same type of immune response for viruses or other pathogens that happen anywhere else.  The brain has its own version of our  immune system to combat foreign particles but less robust.\n\nSecondly, the symptoms of infection before it reaches the CNS vary wildly, from flu-like, or mild pain in the muscle, or fatigue, or even none at all.  So there is very few telltale signs of an early rabies specific infection.\n\nThirdly, the viral load before it reaches the brain is so low it is extremely difficult to test for unless the doctors know exactly where to be looking and with sensitive enough tests.  So even if it is being looked for it may easily evade testing for early infections.\n\nAnd lastly, by the time it becomes apparent the infection is rabies by the symptoms of the patient, the virus has already reached the brain, multiplied, and is virtually untreatable due to the aforementioned immune privileged status and the brain's immune system being ill equipped to fight the infection.\n\nAll of that is why it is so deadly.  It's extremely difficult to check for when it is treatable and almost impossible to treat when it's in the final stages.",

Is this because, by the time they're infected enough to go crazy, the viral load is so high that it's easy to detect? What about if their viral load is still low (e.g. perhaps you got bit by a bat but that bat wasn't actually exhibiting symptoms and was still very very early in the disease progression and had a very low viral load?)?\n\nOr, are you just saying you essentially need a very specific test (e.g. ELISA or something) in order to detect it, but so long as you have the right test, you'll probably be able to detect it?",

If the animal displays symptoms, it gets euthanized and its head is sent for necropsy/testing.  Cross sections of the cerebellum and brain stem are imprinted into microscope slides and exposed to fluorescent antibody tags.  If the animal is positive, it's usually pretty apparent on the microscope reads.  This whole procedure can be done in a few hours and is incredibly accurate so it's considered the gold standard of rabies testing in animals.  I used to run the test for a couple of years at a diagnostic lab and it was pretty interesting.",

Raccoons and foxes eventually succumb to the virus, but bats don't - their immune system is weird and they can live with a myriad of viruses that would kill most animals.   It has to do with the fact that they're in constant motion, yet have almost no inflammation - it's really interesting to read about.  But this is also why bats are a common vector for human infection - they don't show symptoms, but still carry it and their bites are so tiny that they're often missed.

They have a *wild* immune system which involves repair cells other mammals don't have, and during flight their body temperature gets to around 100F which is like how our bodies create a fever to kill viral infections. Bats can be absolutely crawling with infectious viruses (often well over 100) but their body can avoid getting sick from them, despite the infection persisting in the bat.

The immune system for a lot of people manages to basically wrap up the TB cells, containing them and making the person asymptomatic and non-contagious with a latent version of the virus.  If you have latent tb and your immune system goes to hell you can still have problems with it, but there are plenty of people out there infected with the biggest killer disease who dont even know it and are totally fine.",

Plus, with how effective post exposure prophylaxis is, there\u2019s no real drive to completely eradicate it. If you get bit, you get the vaccine, and you\u2019re fine. You vaccinate your dogs and the odds of you coming into contact with it are fairly slim.",

Number of reported animal infections (both wild and farm animals) in EU has dropped from just under 1000/year in 2010 to fewer than 5/year in the last several years. The goal is to reach 0 by 2030.\n\nEven those rare cases are pretty much only in countries that border countries outside EU that are  not part of that vaccination program.

As for the reason why, it's probably in large part because the brain is practically melting in the skull towards the later stages of the disease and the animal runs on pure instinct (which barely functions any better than the higher parts of the brain at that point). The animal loses all sense of danger and so will just wander up to anything that moves and thus might give off the impression of being aggressive.  Most mammals will bite as a self-defense mechanism, hence when the mammal has no other thoughts it reverts to just biting anything that it comes into contact with. Humans of course are a rare exception in that we don't really use our teeth as weapons. \n\nThis bit is a tad more speculative on my part, but in my opinion our instincts are perhaps a bit duller than many other animals in the sense that we don't tend to just randomly attack anything that moves when our higher brain functions shut off. This could be part of why humans don't really exhibit any aggression in the furious form of rabies, in the form of bites or otherwise.",

Named lyssa after the goddess of chaos , the lyssa virus enters the body from a bite of an infected animal . If this is a smaller animal with small teeth , like a bat, you may not even feel the bite . \n\nDepending on where the bite is , the virus will take some time to travel to the brain by hitching a ride on some nerve cells. During this time. Its still possible to get a vaccine and survive. This is why rabies is one of the few things you can get a vaccine for \u201cafter\u201d you have been exposed. The closer the original bit was to your brain. Generally the less time youll have . As soon as its made that journey and symptoms start , if your not vaccinated your doomed . Lyssa takes over neuron cells and then activates a special immune kill switch that prevents the immune system from tackling it in the brain. It turns out that having white blood cells in the brain is pretty sketch. If they start getting a bit over eager , the brain has a kill button to stop white blood cells from damaging sensitive neurons since brain damage is generally bad . \n\nSo once its in the brain it takes over the control centre of neuron cells and makes white blood cells think they have been too aggressive and they need to self terminate to protect the brain. So the immune system has no chance of stopping it . \n\nThen , through a not well understood process the virus moves out of the brain and into the saliva of the victim. Where a bite will transfer to a new host . \n\nAs more brain cells fall victim to the virus and are forced to produce more virus, normal brain function breaks down and the brain swells ,  killing you by a form of encephalitis.",

Risk factors for bat exposure included age less than or equal to 25 years and owning animals that had been bitten by bats. Rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (rVNAs) were detected in 11% (7 of 63) of human sera tested. Rabies virus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected in the sera of three individuals, two of whom were also seropositive for rVNA. Rabies virus RNP IgM antibodies were detected in one respondent with no evidence of rVNA or RNP IgG antibodies. Because one respondent with positive rVNA results reported prior vaccination and 86% (six of seven) of rVNA-positive respondents reported being bitten by bats, *these data suggest nonfatal exposure of persons to rabies virus*, which is likely associated with vampire bat depredation.\n\nThere do seem to be some communities in South America at least where there've been quite a few people who are exposed to rabies and survived.",

Less foreign material, less infected cells means the virus can move around for a while before it is eliminated.\n\nIt uses that time to travel into the nearest nerve, and then it moves up that nerve towards the spine and brain.  Nerves, particularly the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) have [immune privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_privilege).  The immune system is much more prone to ignore foreign material around nerves, because they're so important.  A bad cell in most organs is not a big deal; there are tons of other cells doing the exact same job.  There's no backup for a nerve.  There's one cell, and [if the immune system attacks it then you lose sense/movement in that area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillain%E2%80%93Barr%C3%A9_syndrome).\n\nThis is basically the same as how things like chicken pox stay with you for your entire life.  Once you're infected with chicken pox, Epstein-Barr, Cytomegalovirus, HSV-1/HSV-2 etc they all hide inside your nerve cells and reemerge throughout your life.  It's rare for those infections to travel to your brain, but when they do [its a medical emergency and often fatal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herpesviral_encephalitis).",

            "comment": "Millions of people survive rabies every year, but very few have ever survived once symptoms started showing, and no one (to my knowledge) had survived without medical intervention.\n\nWhen you are bitten by an animal infected with rabies, the virus is transferred to you, where it doesn't do much of anything for a while, including replicate. At this stage, the viral load is so low the immune system cannot see it to mount a response. A rabies shot will kick the immune system into gear and it can then very easily and rapidly destroy the virus before it does any harm. This is why it's so vital to get a rabies shot any time you a bitten by an animal that could possibly carry rabies, or been in close contact with a bat from an area with rabies.\n\nIf rabies is not treated at this point, the virus then travels through the nervous system into the brain, where, as others have correctly pointed out, it cannot easily be detected and fought by the immune system. This is the point where it starts to replicate in significant numbers, and symptoms begin to show. At this point it is generally too late to treat, and certainly too late to for the parson to ever make a full recovery. That is because the symptoms are caused by the damage done to the brain by the virus, and brain damage is almost always irreversible. The real kicker though, is that bit where the immune system can't effectively fight interventions inside the brain and nervous system. That's because the immune response would be too damaging to the brain.  Therefore, the vaccine is no longer relevant or effective.  The next line of defence is antivirals. Apart from being difficult to administer to a patient exhibiting the symptoms of an active rabies infection. My knowledge gets a bit thinner here, but I believe they simply take too long. Remember, most of the symptoms we're observing so far are a result of the damage done to the brain by the virus, so even if we killed the virus, the damage remains.  In the end, the virus has done too much damage too quickly.\n\nThe few people who have survived, have done so with pretty radical interventions that began very quickly once symptoms began. They also only survived with varying degrees of permanent brain damage",

It\u2019s typically 20 to 90 days before symptoms manifest, which is why there is time for treatment via immunoglobulin that is almost 100% effective.\n\nIt\u2019s still a roll of the dice if you want too long to seek treatment as incubation can be as low as 4 days, so seek medical treatment asap if bitten by a potential rabies carrier.\n\nWe don\u2019t have Rabies here in Oz, but we do have the closely related Lyssavirus. I was bitten rescuing a fruit bat while in holiday last year in North Queensland. They are known sources of Lyssavirus, which has killed a few people over the last decade or so in Oz. I was pretty nonchalant about it as the bat seemed stunned but fine, until I did a little research into Lyssavirus, which also has no cure if left untreated.\n\nI went to a small regional hospital where they had no human rabies immunoglobulin on hand. I had to wait until the following day for treatment to be shipped by air to another hospital 200km away. Bat bites are a bigger deal than I thought and the health system here pulls out all stops whenever one pops up.\n\nThe bite was on the side of my palm and I had a horse needle full of HRIG shoved an inch deep into the wound, which was fun. The follow-up treatment was 1000km away when I got back home a few days later. Hopefully it worked, I guess I\u2019ll know within the next 5 years or so.",

One of my coauthors, Dr. Willoughby helped pioneer the \"Milwaukee Protocol\" which helps saves lives from rabies.

It's more difficult for the virus to get people to infect other animals or people, than it is for say a canid or rodent. Viruses that infect other organisms than their target host either die themselves and/or kills the errant host quickly.",

Once it invades the CNS, it has access to all other areas of your body, and spreads rapidly. This level of CNS disruption / damage is simply not something one survives, it causes too many systemic failures throughout the body in a very short period of time. The body is overwhelmed and succumbs before the immune system even has a chance of mounting an adaptive defense.",

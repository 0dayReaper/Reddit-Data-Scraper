            "comment": "Neuroscience Prof checking in. That is a good question, and to my knowledge, does not have a good answer. This is partly because the term stress is not well defined, and is not a unitary thing. A brief stress, like someone jump scaring you, releases a good dose of adrenaline, norepinephrine, and other chemicals that heighten many senses briefly - for instance people are better at visual search in this state. But chronic stress is often associated with inflammation, which appears to dull senses. There are a myriad states of stress in between - from not sleeping for a couple days, being ill, anxiety of some upcoming event, etc. These can affect all sorts of hormones and other signaling molecules to affect the brain.",

There's no scientific consensus on how many senses humans have. 7 is a reasonable number, though I'd be curious how you got it.\n\n9 is probably the most common answer now, adding mechanoreception (proprioception, balance, etc), interoreception (feeling \"full\", the feeling of a deep breath), pain, and temperature to the traditional 5.\n\nIf you further subdivide every category (counting balance and proprioception as two different senses, for example), then the \"true\" answer is likely somewhere in the 30s or 40s.",

    "postText": "Seeing as people living in regions with less sun coverage and less frequent exposure tend to have lighter blue eyes, it seems this is the body\u2019s attempt to let more light in. With less melanin acting as sunglasses in the iris, it allows for better photon reception, thus letting more light in. This, of course, also means that people with lighter colored eyes are more sensitive to bright light/the sun. \n\nAnyways, if someone has blue eyes, and they moved up to Scandinavia in a darker region, would the melanin in their iris eventually lower and bring out a brighter shade of blue? \n\nThanks strangers, cheers to science! Keep being awesome!",

It turns brown in the sun but that skin flakes off and six months later you're cracker-white again. \n\nThe iris and things attached to it have very slow metabolism, and epithelial cells containing melanin don't usually slough off unless there's friction or a pigment dispersion syndrome. And then you can see little melanocytes floating up and down in the anterior chamber convection currents. They don't disappear. Loose melanocytes and any inflammatory cells eventually accumulate here and there and even clog up the drain causing glaucoma.\n\nEyes are sometimes born lighter and develop more melanin. But it rarely goes the other way.. when you see color change from brown to lighter colors in the human iris, it's usually a pathological process. The idea that iris color changes morning to evening or in any other cyclic fashion would be unsupported by evidence. *Apparent* color is influenced by illumination, background, and subjective naming.",

But afaik that doesn't affect the whole body, and there are situations where a person with a baseline layer of tan (non-white people) get zero sun exposure for months - they don't turn white, they just get a bit paler. They remain genetically predisposed to make a certain amount of melanin regardless of light exposure. That's the 'natural tone' that is being referred to.",

If there is no pigment, then the structure of your eye determines what intensity of blue it is.",

The most beneficial traits for that specific environment get passed on, the most detrimental get weeded out. Over a long time, traits like skin and eye colour would shift to suit your environment. As for people with blue eyes, they wouldn't change, but over generations their descendants would produce people with grey eyes (and photosensitivity) like me. The increased night vision would help the low light environment.\n\nThat said, it's unlikely to happen in the modern age, as we don't really adapt to our environment anymore, we adapt it to suit us.

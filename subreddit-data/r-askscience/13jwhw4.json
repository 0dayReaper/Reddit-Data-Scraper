If there is a separation of populations then you could see changes over time. \n\nBut from a practical view it seems likely there is exchange and interbreeding between all London mice so you might never see genetic evolution quite like the question asks.",

I have just read that wild mice have pretty limited foraging territory (like 3-6 meters from nest), but that can extend if there is no food, and London underground is often less deep than that.",

From https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14437 :\n\n&gt; We have shown that (i) related individuals often\n&gt; remain highly associated in space, leading to localized spatial genetic\n&gt; structure that is strong at short distances but detectable well beyond\n&gt; a single colony; (ii) rats in Manhattan experience sufficient citywide\n&gt; gene flow to prevent differentiation into multiple isolated popula-\n&gt; tions, but exhibit fine-scale structuring into Uptown and Downtown\n&gt; genetic clusters due to landscape effects that cause deviations from\n&gt; IBD\n\nUnfortunately, they did not specifically address any possible above/below-ground divide. And, of course, it's about NYC, not London. There could well be significant differences between the two cities.",

Rats, in climates that experience winter, need the presence of humans. \n\nIt was advantageous in my province, where up until the 1950s or so, human population density was so low(and winters long and cold) that rats couldn't ingress the area. If a farm was infested, the next farm over was further than baby rats could leap ~~frog~~ rat in a year. If they colonised out into a field or forest, for 6 months there was little food, and even if they dug deep dens, cold would be an issue. The ground can freeze to 2 meters (about 6.5 feet) deep over the winter. No viable year round dens, except under buildings. \n\nSo it was sufficient to deal with rats in the little islands of food and warmth that were each farm on the southern and eastern border. Alberta formed a Rat Patrol to deal with incursions and outbreaks, such as rats that might come in on trucks. The tide was held back until the invention of warfarin, an anticoagulant, which made killing rats much easier and cheaper, and today, we're the only (that I know of) region in the world that is officially rat free. We got very lucky, and timing was ideal. Continual diligence is everything, and ongoing.  \n\nIt wasn't a possibility for the northern US in the same way, as people settled closer together, and came before inexpensive and highly effective rat poison was invented. It is a bit warmer, but also, the snow is deeper generally, which cancels out, I figure. Once they're spread in a proper city, there's not much chance of getting them all out. But someone should try. \n\nIn effect, places like the Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut are rat free as well. There aren't many people and its too damn cold for rats. Or for most forms of farming, though animal husbandry does okay. Rats have no way of slowly spreading 400 km between communities.",

In both cases, I believe the TLDR is that once you have your database, you CAN determine the location your individual came from, but overall the level of variation still comfortably fits within the species as a whole and they\u2019re not actually that different. (Sort of analogous to how a DNA test might say your recent ancestors came from Eastern Europe or Northern Africa or etc but we\u2019re all still just humans and haven\u2019t evolved into separate species.)\n\nAlso, I think you overestimate how different life is for tube mice compared to regular city mice. They all eat human garbage\u2014 dropped fast food and etc. They all live in burrows and tunnels and inside walls and preferentially come out at night (though they\u2019re adaptable\u2014 I\u2019m a night shift worker and a mouse in my apartment learned to come out looking for dog food crumbs in the daytime!) and they all experience artificial lighting in stations and homes. They\u2019re all highly social and actually very clean so if they\u2019re not terminally sick/poisoned/etc they don\u2019t tolerate being \u201ccoated in pollutants\u201d, but above-ground mice need to deal with exhaust fumes and gasoline and toxic wall insulation and things just like those underground do. They probably are separate populations just because mouse colony home territories tend to be very small within dense cities\u2014 just a few meters per family group in most cases. But I think the reason they are so successful is that like humans and rats and dogs, they are very curious omnivores who are very very opportunistic. If there\u2019s a place to sleep and almost anything at all to eat, they\u2019re going to consider that habitat. I don\u2019t think from a mouse POV an underground station is all that different from a lot of big above ground buildings.",

For a species that reaches sexual maturity at 4\u20137 weeks of age and has a gestation period of 3\u20134 weeks (so let\u2019s be generous and assume a total of 8 weeks per generation), you\u2019d need a couple dozen millennia (a few hundred thousand generations) to get any significant evolution, and even then it would be incremental, like the difference between homo sapiens and homo australopithecus no (those two diverged some 2.5-ish million years ago, which is about 125,000 generations if we assume 20 years between generations). If there\u2019s no selective pressure (ie no advantage to becoming slightly stronger/faster/smarter/bigger/smaller/etc) because the city mouse is already well-adapted to an underground environment, it could take even longer. And that\u2019s assuming there\u2019s no crossover; as others already mentioned, the two populations you\u2019re considering are likely actually the same population and mice go up and down as needed. I doubt underground-dwelling mice and overground-dwelling mice, if they are at all different populations, are significantly different in terms of genetics.\n\nIt\u2019s a good question, though.

At first I thought they were rats but after trapping some to look closer amd get rid of them they were mice. No idea why they were different but caught them all in traps apart from the mother which was bigger and smarther than the rest. She'd never go near thr traps, in the end I used a big live catch trap with new bait and caught her. Odd looking thing I took pity on and let go in the woods. Never seen it or any mice since.

There's a relatively smaller amount of info to tell you how to put those building blocks together to make a horse...\n\n\"About a third of the genes in these amoebas are shared with humans. These \u201cconserved\u201d genes encode for proteins that form structures that are similar between humans and amoebas \u2014 this is one reason the single-celled creatures are excellent models to study.\"\n\nhttps://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/articles/amoebas-worms-and-flies-oh-my#:\\~:text=Humans%20have%2020%2C000%E2%80%9325%2C000%20genes,are%20excellent%20models%20to%20study.",

In general speech people would use 'a long time' or 'ages' to mean an excessive timeframe in comparison with their lifespan, but realistically speaking, times and dates are social constructs that don't really mean anything to a species on a reproductive level.\n\nSpeciation and evolution can happen at faster rates when under severe pressure which can make it appear as though it's the 'time' that is important but it's all ultimately down to those gametes and how quickly they can get their thing on.",

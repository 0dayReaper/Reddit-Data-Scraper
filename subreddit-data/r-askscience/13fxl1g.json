Depending on what the stone the quarry was mining, you could also be concerned about arsenic, or other common mineral toxins.\n\nIn general just don't go swimming in water pools near industrial areas.",

So you can be walking along through meter deep murky water, when suddenly you walk off the edge of a ten meter drop. \n\nThe water also tends to be very colds, as its usually seeping in from the water table. So people jump in quarries not knowing how deep they are. Then they land in freezing cold water. Their bodies freeze in shock. In shallow water, this is less of an issue, as you can just stand up. But if the water is deep, you can freeze up and just sink right to the bottom. \n\nThere's also submerged hazards. Natural ponds and lakes have formed over eons; their sides and slopes have been eroded smooth. But quarry pits are formed when huge chunks of rock are broken or blasted off a rock face, leaving jagged sharp edges behind. Slip on a the wrong submerged surface, and you might gash your leg open. Finally old quarries often have abandoned equipment , old bits of wire and steel wreckage, etc left on the bottom when they're abandoned. The murky water floods in covering everything up. \n\nhttps://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/dive-team-shows-hidden-dangers-of-quarry-swimming/88890/\n\nAlso there is often a temperature differential. The water near the surface will be warm. So you'll be walking along in shallow water at a comfortable temp. Suddenly you'll fall off a cliff into deep freezing cold water. \n\nFinally, sometimes people leap into a quarry without planning how they're going to get out of it. Imagine a swimming pool with vertical walls extending meters above the water level, and no ladder is there to let you out. People see an inviting pool and leap into it blindly, channeling their inner cliff diver. Then after swimming for a bit, they look around, and realize there's no way out.",

Quarries are often not as isolated as we like to think. \n\nHowever, a lot of fish end up in \"new\" water bodies by getting carried there by humans or other animals, whether on purpose or by accident.\n\nI think the main point is that fish do not start out full-grown, but instead start out as eggs, and the eggs or even the very tiny hatchlings, can survive modest transport in, on, or with mobile life forms.  Sometimes even with debris like leaves and sticks.  Depends.",

Then when they mature they come out of a pod to swim around and carry on the cycle. \nReally. Many are just stocked. To control the algal growth. You need a minimal ecosystem in a body of water to keep it healthy. The ecosystem has sort of two bistable endpoints. And depending on the species living there will go one of two ways. We as humans tend to find the clearer water endpoint more attractive. So a naturalist or someone can shift it to the opposite side as it were. It gets into some systems biology which is outside the scope here. You may even see a solar water agitator to oxygenate the water a bit a pill it from the low oxygen high plant growth state",

And the sturgeon no one has any clue how he got in there. there is a cave i there that connects to Mississippi river and could had a current come in with them. Or maybe a bird came in with a egg. There are a lot of ways it could have got in. And this goes for most other places with",

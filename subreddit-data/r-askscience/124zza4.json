    "postText": "So after taking about like 6 different online color blind tests I figured out that I might have tritanomaly color blindness. While I understand I should probably see an eye specialist for a real diagnosis, I\u2019m having a lot of questions popping up after reading about colorblindness. As long as I can remember I\u2019ve just had this weird thing with some shades of blue where it just blurs everything around it. I never really thought much of it or even that I could be colorblind until recently. I know for sure that I am pretty severely night blind and so is my mother and I\u2019m wondering if the two (night blindness and tritanomaly) are correlated or if it\u2019s just a coincidence and they aren\u2019t related at all. I\u2019m also curious because to my knowledge my dad isn\u2019t color blind (my born sex is female) and can see perfectly fine at night time as well.",

            "comment": "Tritanomaly is very rare and (I think) it's not very well understood, since cases are so rarely encountered. I think there's even still debate regarding whether tritanomaly is actually a thing like prot/deuteranomaly (where the pigment is present but misformed), or whether it's actually just incomplete tritanopia (where the pigment is *absent*, but maybe only in some cones).\n\nIt's also possible that tritanomaly cases are *acquired*, meaning that something happened to impair or damage the S-cones. I guess it's possible that, if that were the case, rod function (subserving \"night vision\") might also be impaired.\n\nBut that's all pretty hard to know from here. But the notion of *acquired* color deficiency brings to mind the possibility of *disease*.\n\nI would recommend that, if you haven't gone in a long while, you should see an optometrist or someone else who can have a look in there to make sure you don't have any kind of degenerative retinal disease going on. Lots of disorders can show up, early on, as distorted color vision, night blindness, blurriness, etc etc.",

I do regularly go to the eye doctor though because I wear glasses and they\u2019ve never noticed anything. I also don\u2019t want people to get the wrong idea that I\u2019m asking medical advice, just like you said there\u2019s just not a lot of information available. I do see an optometrist yearly and I\u2019ve had these symptoms my whole life. In my head it would make sense that if I can\u2019t see dark blues very well that would make sense that I\u2019m night blind but I\u2019m also not a scientist or a doctor and I don\u2019t know how the human eye works \ud83d\ude02",

But I can't find any! I think it's because such subjects are so rare, but I'd love to be corrected or to learn more about the topic...",

                    "comment": "My only argument with the blue lights is that it\u2019s not just those for me I can actually see those better. It\u2019s actually like neon light blue, or for instance like the petsmart sign at night time, I know that it says pet smart but I can\u2019t read it. Or neon open signs I can see the open in red but the blue around it could be a square or some bizarre shape and I would never know the difference. Another good example is like old tvs with no input, that color actually physically hurts me lol. \n\nMy other question is why am I so night blind, would that be a separate condition? Unless it\u2019s well lit and I know where I\u2019m going I don\u2019t drive at night time. I\u2019m more worried that I might have signs of cataracts but I go to the eye doctor regularly and they\u2019ve never noticed anything and I\u2019ve had these symptoms as long as I can remember",

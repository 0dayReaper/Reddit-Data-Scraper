    "postText": "I heard this claim a view years ago in a song by Big Word Club (https://youtu.be/hymyFliRNPI/?t=1m33s). I couldn't believe it, so I looked it up, but I didn't find any sources supporting the claim.\n\nIf I understand it correctly, blue-footed booby nests look nothing like the bowl-shaped stick nest shown in the animation but instead consist of a few little sticks lying on the ground and a scrape, surrounded by excrement. So there's not really anything to tear down, and it wouldn't make any sense to do so either.\n\nI even tried contacting Big Word Club, asking how that claim ended up in the video, but I haven't gotten an answer. I know, I don't have care this much, but I would like to be absolutely certain.",

            "comment": "I believe the blue-footed booby doesn't technically make a nest, it lays the egg on bare ground. They then defecate around the egg as they sit on it.\n\nIt appears that video may have misunderstood the mating ritual involving giving a stone or stick to a female.\n\nyou can watch it happen here:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcPHFQP9GN0",

            "comment": "Not something I've researched, but according to the naturalist guide in the Galapagos blue footed boobies just lay their eggs on the ground (dirt). He never mentioned creating and then destroying a nest, that I would have in my notes! All my photos just show eggs/chicks on the ground, no \"nests\" or debris from nests, just a giant poop circle. Sometimes they lay their eggs in the middle of the walking path and guides or park rangers have to create a new path for the season. \n\nThe red footed boobies have nests.",

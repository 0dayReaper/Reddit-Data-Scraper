            "comment": "**Ph.D. in Vaccine Development here.**   \nShort answer: Many many reasons   \nSlightly longer answer: \n\n* Combination of impact and design difficulty - Understandably, vaccines were developed for the most common/most impactful diseases (the need) + a combination of how easy/straightforward it was to design the vaccine, based on what we knew about the pathogen, its structure, the immunodominant antigen, and most importantly the correlate of protection. So you could think that a lot of the impactful diseases, that have the advantage of straightforward design - e.g. low mutation ability, limited immunodominant antigens, clear correlates of protection, e.g. antibodies have been addressed - Rotavirus, pneumococcal pneumonia, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, etc. etc. \n* Others are ones that have high impact but pose considerable scientific challenges - Flu, HIV etc. There's been lots of work and $ put into them but their high mutation rates mean they are scientifically hard to crack. That's why while we have \\*generally effective\\* flu vaccines, we still need to rely on strain coverage and annual seleciton. We've been making steady progress towards a universal flu vaccine, but it's still a while away. For e.g. for flu, we know the correlate of protection, but don't have a stable/conserved immunodominant antigen yet... for HIV - mix of both, some potential immunodominant antigens, but the high mutation rate is a fucking nightmare. RSV is similar - there has been a lot of interest due to the high impact, but the concern is scientific (antigen selection and immune response) than lack of resources \n* Then there is the need aspect, in the other direction - Vaccine development is expensive, and takes time. So you need resources, and in current society - conpanies investing in this need to recoup their costs - so this goes into the argument on funding. Someone else in this thread brought up chikungunya - Yep, decent example - mostly a disease affecting developing countries, but other than a few labs, and a few startups focuisng on emerging diseases, there wasn't that much effort in there - from the U.S. side - till recently. It has been in development in other countries, but like I said, this takes time.... and resources \n* mRNA vaccine tech - This tech has been in development for the last 18 years or so. It is not new! The problem is, as most of the \"easy\" targets were taken up by other vaccines as mentioned earlier - they had a higher bar to prove. For a new tech, they need to convince regulators, that their vaccine is as good/better than established ones, as opposed to just proving they work. Plus the cold chain concerns etc. are a factor. But the key advantage for them was always the speed of reactivity - Once a pathogen is identified/sequenced, it's much quicker to design an mRNA vaccine than a protein/live inactivated etc. so companies like Novavax, Moderna, Biontech have been working on mRNA vaccines for a while as the USP is ability to react quickly to novel antigens - as what happened here. \n* This is a litmus test for new vaccine tech, and it will be fascinating to see where we go from here. As this tech takes center stage, we can expect more investment in this tech for other diseases.",

I actually just submitted a paper on a vaccine we developed against another alphavirus and one reviewer shit all over the fact that with so few diagnosed cases (disregarding the fact that they typically occur in remote regions without access to modern medicine to properly diagnose) that the pursuit of further development was not realistic. Wanted me to put in the paper something like \"hey, we did this and it was very effective, but you shouldn't care about it because this will never make it to market\". \n\nOf course we submitted to a neglected tropical disease journal. Like, I get their point, but damn, unless you have points of scientific merit, having your major issues with the paper be feasibility in go-to-market is totally asinine in peer-review.",

It was just perplexing how they totally missed/misinterpreted the larger features of the study. They were really angry that we showed cross-protection against CHIKV and another co-circulating alpha since it would never be used off label and other CHIKV vaccines are being made. \n\nIt was like \"dude, we aren't claiming that. We're showing that vaccines against alpha's should be tested against those in the same antigenic complex because vaccination against the target virus could provide benefits against the other ones.\" Idk who they were, but someone shit in their cheerios the morning they reviewed it evidently.",

SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus (no population with previous immunity) that is also widespread (people are both willing to take it and the populations targeted in the clinical trials also have a high risk of transmission so that you can more rapidly test efficacy). The 2nd part is actually really important as you cannot ethically give someone an infectious disease just to test vaccine efficacy. Therefore, it takes much longer to get clinical trials complete for diseases that are less widespread.",

Always, every case for all our decades of history with modern vaccines. \n\nIf the side effect is *really rare*, it can take many years to collect enough data to prove the connection. It's not that the side effect had any kind of delayed onset, it's that the rarity makes it hard to spot. Narcolepsy from the European version of the pandemic swine flu vaccine is an example in this category.\n\nWith the long haulers post-viral fatigue, the heart risks to anyone else who is athletic, the fatality rate in the obese and elderly, the strain on our health care workers... it's hard to see an argument that the risk that a really rare side effect is unknown outweighs the risk of continued susceptibility to covid19.",

The time burden is typically regulatory, doing research, getting approval to do more testing, etc. The other barrier to other vaccines is having the underlying technology and understanding of how to create them.  \n\n\nIt's not that the science was sloppy or rushed. But instead of having to do one trial, completing it, publishing, then doing another and another a lot of steps occurred simultaneously and regulatory agencies accepted data as it came in rather than waiting for everything to be completed before moving onto the next phase.  \nJonas Salk, who had far less resources than today's pharmaceutical companies have devoted to COVID vaccines, developed his vaccine for polio in 1952. It wasn't licensed until 1955. It took many years before people developed the underlying know how to make this possible - how to isolate the virus, how to mass produce the vaccine, etc. We already know how to synthesize mRNA. We know plenty of things about coronaviruses. We sequenced the genome for COVID in days.",

This makes it a much more difficult task to come up with an effective vaccine for HIV.\n\nAs for the others, its more of an economic reason than a biological one. The scale of the COVID pandemic has caused governments and industry worldwide to pour money into the development of a vaccine -- and that level of demand just isn't there for RSV/EBV/etc. Would love for someone with more of a background in healthcare economics to chime in here.",

It's kind of like directions written on a napkin: cells use them and then toss them) nor did they know how to get cells to readily accept it. Pfizer and Moderna both figured it out independently using Covid funding.\n\nBasically, they have proven a general vaccine technique can work by demonstrating it works on Covid-19.\n\nu/smallaubergine\n\nEdit: correction: the mRNA technique already existed before Coronavirus, but it didn't work super well for other diseases it was tested on. The problem is that you need an mRNA sequence that produces a protein that presents to the immune system and is similar enough to the original virus' protein and does no harm and is absorbed by the right cells. These requirements made mRNA vaccines not work super well in the past, but with Coronavirus it works well. So while corona advanced mRNA it's almost more a case of a problem finding an existing solution.",

The problem both were having and will continue to have is the selectivity and targeting of the mRNA. Neither company has had an approval in Cancer medication yet because thy cant seem to deliver the mRNA to the tumor consistently. \n\n\nThe focus on a vaccination got over this problem because it doesn't matter as much which cells read the mRNA. All they want to do is have the body produce the protein.",

As a concept, it's most useful for rare diseases where the volunteer could disproportionately benefit, but there aren't enough patients to have a prompt clinical trial.\n\nIf you're interested in accelerating the hypothetical approval process for a covid-like vaccine, then I think the most relevant regulatory blocker would be challenge trials; those could demonstrate efficacy more quickly, at the cost of causing direct harm if the vaccine is not effective.\n\nHowever, I don't think either approach would have greatly accelerated the *deployment* of the covid vaccines.  As far as I am aware, the development process is so well-funded that the manufacturers were building their production lines _alongside_ the approval process, rather than after.  Even if the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines had approval in June, there would not be any more doses available today.",

For example, even adults who have lived in malarious areas all their lives can still get low levels of malaria infection and malaria immunity can drop off fast once you move to malaria free regions and are no longer exposed (as little as six months). \nSo we also have to figure out how to get a malaria vaccine to produce more effective immunity than repeated infections with the disease itself which is a big hurdle.",

            "comment": "[I found think link helpful when explaining this to someone else!](https://www.healthline.com/health/hiv-aids/vaccine-how-close-are-we)\n\nA brief summary of the key points:\n1) vaccines are made to mimic a person's immune response. Since no one has ever recovered from HIV, we can't mimic that. It's like if i asked you to mimic my great aunt's voice - you can't because you don't know what it sounds like (I don't even know what it sounds like).\n2) vaccines don't prevent infection, they just help protect against the disease. They're made to buy the body time to fight the infection and give the body the tools necessary to fight it. But HIV lays dormant in the body for a LONG time before it progresses to AIDS, and while it's dormant, it hides and reproduces in cells without anyone knowing. Then that means the body has to fight even harder to get rid of the infection completely, IF it can find all the copies.\n3) most viruses that have vaccines enter through the gastrointestinal or respiratory systems. HIV primarily enters through the genitals or blood, which we have MUCH less experience in fighting, let alone making something to fight it\n4) HIV mutates too quickly, it's constantly changing and evolving, and we have no way to track those changes or predict when the next change will happen or what it will be. What's effective as a vaccine now, by the time appropriate testing is done, it might be useless!\n5) most commonly, a killed or weakened strain of a virus is used to develop a vaccine so that the body can learn to fight it off. However, in initial trials, a killed or weakened form of HIV was not effective and didn't produce an immune response. The standard form of the virus is too dangerous to use for these purposes.\n\nAlso, there is the prEP pill is also available to help the body prevent HIV, but it's a regularly taken pill, NOT a one-time shot vaccine.\n\nEdited to add: HIV, while it's been around and harming humans for a long time, was largely ignored until the 1980's because of its association with the LGBTQ+ people.",

For example the seasonal flu vaccine is basically a best estimation every year of which [handfull of mutations/strains](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-selection.htm) are going to be the worst that year.  Some of the viruses that don't mutate quickly are the easy ones that you get vaccinated against once and are good for life.  The faster mutating ones are just hard as heck to lock down.\n\nOne example is Polio.  We were so dang close to eradication back in 2017 when we had [22](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/does-polio-still-exist-is-it-curable) reported cases globally.  ~~But then if i remember correctly it mutated and that spiked.~~(edit:  Sounds like I didn't remember correctly.

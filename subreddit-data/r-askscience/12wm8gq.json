Once you actually want to pee, you get inhibition of those neurons =&gt; the external urethral sphincter opens up =&gt; you pee\n\nOther factors also contribute to this, such as the bladder capacity, which increases until adulthood.",

This doesn't work for every child though.\n\nThe other is behavioural, sometimes people just sleep so deeply that their brain totally tunes out the messages from the body. In those cases usually some form of alarm that responds to the wetness is used to essentially reach the brain what the trigger is for peeing during sleep. \n\nThe third side is of course childhood trauma where it's not a physiological thing as wth the other two above.",

But suddenly in the dream I had to pee so bad, so the objective changed... forget the princess, the objective was to find a medieval bathroom... you know the ones that just overhand the stone walls and your stuff just plops into the moat below... so I'm battling through enemies fighting them off and finally I find a bathroom... I unhinge a few armor plates, loosen the trousers and taste sweet victory finally able to relieve myself.\n\nI woke up and I had wet the bed. lol.\n\nGood memory.",

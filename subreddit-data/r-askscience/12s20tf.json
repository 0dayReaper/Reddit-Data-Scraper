However, when utilized as a fuel, H\u2082O\u2082 doesn't \"oxidize itself\", but rather exothermically decomposes into water and Oxygen in the presence of a suitable catalyst, e.g. platinum.",

            "comment": "Generally, no.  Depends what everyone thinks particular words mean when having that discussion.\n\nAn example is nitroglycerin.  The molecule is both a fuel and an oxidizer.  It can be burned as a fuel by itself.  Some good, some bad properties.  It can be mixed with another fuel to act as an oxidizer.  Ratio of mixing is very important.\n\nChemically, we can write a formula for a material and what it turns into when it burns.  To really optimize it, we want both sides of that equation to be equal.  All the atoms in the starting material must turn into a another molecule at the end of the reaction.\n\n4 C3H5N3O9 -&gt; 12 CO2(g) + 10 H2O(g) + 6 N2(g) + O2(g)\n\nNitroglycern generates a small amount of extra oxygen it can give to other molecules.\n\nWe don't usually consider it oxidizing itself, since we ideally want to consume all of the container.\n\nPractically, a single molecule of nitroglycern does donate oxygen to neighbouring molecules.  That's how it is possible to optimize a blast wave, shock wave, propagation of an explosive.",

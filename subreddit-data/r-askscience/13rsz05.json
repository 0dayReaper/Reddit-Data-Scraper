    "postText": "I have seen studies from CDC where they say the transmission rate per act for unprotected receptive anal sex with a  positive partner is 1-1.3%.\n\nThe transmission rate for using a needle contaminated with HIV+ blood is 0.6%. \n\nI would have thought transmitting the HIV+ of blood directly into someone else's blood with a needle that contains live virus particles would be &gt;90% infection.",

I would probably have only used the 1992 Kaplan paper for needle sharing but even still there was some heavy extrapolation used in that estimate (0.67% per act).\n\nUltimately, the main takeaway is that HIV tainted blood supplies are excellent vectors for transmission. This is why we had a blanket ban on MSM donating blood that was only updated in the last couple weeks:\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/gay-bisexual-men-can-donate-blood-new-fda-rules-rcna83937](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/gay-bisexual-men-can-donate-blood-new-fda-rules-rcna83937)\n\nAs far as the other acts, those numbers are far from exact. Basically, there's obviously a non-zero risk per act so use condoms and clean needles.",

            "comment": "The needle isn't used for blood transfusion from a HIV+ person to a HIV- person. The needle is for drug injection. There are only traces of blood on the needle. \n\nIf you do a complete blood transfusion, the HIV+ person isn't taking antivirals, and the HIV- person isn't immune, the transmission would have a 100% rate. You would always transfuse enough HIV particles with the blood to infect someone. \n\nFor sharing needles that are used for drugs, the amount of HIV particles transferred is relatively small, so infection isn't guarantee. It's similar to the sexual acts.",

    "postText": "The textbook answer I seem to find everywhere is that they are a way to **represent** field strength and direction, they flow from north to south and the strength of the magnetic field is represented by the density of the lines in a given area. Sure, that makes sense.\n\nHowever, my question arises when I physically see lines of flux when I scatter iron filings around a magnet. Surely these are not just a representation but a physical reality. In other words, if they were \\*just\\* a representation, we wouldn't observe them in the exact same way in physical reality, just as you would never be able to \"see\" the sine wave representing pressure changes moving through the air when describing sound, because that is not what is physically happening.\n\nI'm curious why everything I can find says that they are merely a representation, and yet we can physically see lines forming from iron filings. What's going on there?\n\nEdit: thank you for the excellent answers everyone! All these answers have collectively helped a lot. \n\nr/askscience rocks!",

The hills don't suddenly stair step up at each line, but where the lines are densest is where the contour changes the fastest, aka the steepest parts. \n\n'Flux' is 'change' so 'flux density' is how fast the field changes from point to point, aka how 'steep' the field is. \n\nWhen you see lines in iron filings, it's because the field itself likes pushing through iron more than it likes pushing through air or vacuum. So the flux lines 'bunch up' and pull the filings along with them as they seek the minimum energy configuration between moving through the easier path or the shorter path.",

Rivers always flow perpendicular to contour lines, in other words, along the flux of the gravity field. Similarly, filings orient along flux lines, as though flowing down a magnetic slope.\n\nIt\u2019s still not a perfect comparison because of the way 3D fields are projected onto 2D models for human convenience, but I think it should still be a helpful visual.\n\n* this is for OP\u2019s benefit, not disagreeing with you in any way.",

Watercourses bunch up because they carve a little channel and the more they carve the more water flows down it.\n\nFWIW, there is a (largely abandoned) map rendering technique of showing slope/aspect by hachures, where the lines do go along the maximum gradient instead of the zero gradient (so at right angles to how a contour line would be drawn). [example](https://etc.usf.edu/clipart/76800/76892/76892_shrlinshdng.htm) and [example](https://www.meubliz.com/definition/hachure/)",

The second thing that needs to be taken into account is that the filings have their own domains and affect eachother and the field around them.\n\nThe problem op noticed was the **distinct** lines you get when you expose ferro/ferrimagnetic dust to a magnetic field. Why are there such distinct lines in a fairly continuous gradient? The answer doesn't intuitively follow...  The added info that the filings not only take the shape of the field but, slightly confine the part of the field that passes through them is what leads to the conclusion that even though the field (without other objects inside) would have a continuous gradient, the filings themselves don't (and shouldn't) represent that properly.",

Rather the magnetic field is just a vector field, and the reason the iron particles align themselves with isn't because they're interacting with a field line.

If you look up in the sky there are no large arrows floating about (obviously).  Why?  Because its a representation.  What do the arrows represent?  They represent the vector of wind velocity.  Hence a wind map is essentially a vector field.\n\nNow an important distinction.  Which comes first?  The measurement of the wind velocities to \"make the map\" or the map then leads to the wind velocities?  Obviously the former.  You measure the wind velocities and then put them on a map.  You dont create the map and then say \"oh look but if I measure it I can *see* the wind velocities, surely the arrows are real\".\n\nThe same is true with the magnet.  You measure the flux density around it, and then you put that as a representation, and that's what the \"field lines\" are.  The cause and effect is wrong in that experiment that you're describing: the iron filings one.  People normally think of it as \"because there are field lines, the iron filings align themselves along these lines\".  In reality its the complete opposite: \"the strength of the magnet varies in an non-uniform, and unusual way.  We can map it by dropping lots of little magnets nearby.  Oh look there's a shape to the field.  Now we can sketch a diagram which will represent the shape which we observe.\"  Then we act surprised when we do the iron filings experiment and the result is *exactly what we already knew would happen.*\n\nThere are no physical lines.  The iron filings fall into \"lines\" because by putting a magnetically permeable material in a magnetic field, they turn into mini magnets.  And what you are seeing is the same effect as if you put 2 magnet near each other they will exert forces on each other, which, if greater than friction will cause the magnets to quickly \"snap together\".  You're just seeing this effect on a large macro scale with many iron filings.  They will \"snap to\" the nearest magnet - which in many cases is another little iron filing which has snapped to the magnet itself and so on.  This is why you get the \"line effect\".",

            "comment": "I think the biggest problem here is how to understand the word *representation*.\n\n\nIt simply means that this is not how the field can be accuratly described. As you already noticed visulizing the field lines offers an immediate understanding of the direction and strength of the field. If you would more accuratley, mathematically want to sketch your field strength you would need to calculate a kind of intensity map or a quiverplot with infinitesimaly small arrows. But even that wouldn't be enough and also not offer the understanding of the concept that is supposed to be tougth. Additionaly we as humans can not perceive *continuous* values accuratly as we are inherently limited by the perception of our eyes, so we search for representations of concepts that we can understand intuitivly, which is doubly important in the case of teaching. \n\n\nEven the experiment you describe only measures your field at discrete points, which is why it is close to the representation.\n\n\nIn short terms *representation* in this case should mean it is a simplification and represents part of the field in an intuitiv manner.",

            "comment": "I believe the reason is that the field is continuous strongest close to the magnet and weaker as you move away from the magnet.  Would be more accurately represented by a color (say Red) bright near the magnet and fading as you move away from them magnet.\n\nHence the statement that discrete lines are a \"representation\"",

            "comment": "The book is correct. Fields are space filling. Directionalities are assigned by forces they give rise to but I don\u2019t think it makes sense to think of the lines as being real. B(r,t) is real and under very few scenarios if any will that be finite number of grouped field lines. It just fills a region of space. We represent the density as lines when we do it on paper. Computers as I know would rather go with gradient plots.",

            "comment": "You got a lot of good comments, so I'll only say this, you've correctly noticed something *wrong* that many textbooks say. Another example of a wrong thing is when you see those photos of ball-like planets sitting on a 'rubber sheet' and the explanation says this is how gravity bends space.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIf we turn to gravitational fields for simplicity, the gravitational field strength at a point p of space, in units of m^2 / s^2  is merely the force (=acceleratoin) that would be experienced by a 1 kg object if you put it at that point. Physically you can make that force vector by letting the object go for an instant to measure its speed, and then keeping its speed constant for  1 second to see where it ends up, and you can make an arrow whose beginning point is p and whose ending point is where the object ended up after moving it for 1 second at that initial velocity.  \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo it is possible to make a physical thing that corresponds to the graviational field, but the gravitational field is simply the acceleration (=force) that WOULD BE experienced if you DID put a 1kg mass there.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe 'lines' of any vector field can be made by using a mathematical notion that vector-fields correspond precisely to 'flows.'  That is, you can make all points of space move such that their velocity is dictated by whatever vector field you like, and you can draw the path of each point.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThis is another thing that could be replicated by a physical experiment. For lines  of gravitational filed, just immerse everything in a viscous medium so that velocity is proportional to force. Then put a 1kg object at each point of space, and as these objects drift down they will draw 'lines of the graviatiional field.'\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSince the advent of relativity, with no intrinsic 'dot product' that allows us to identify forms with their duals, it is usually done to make a distinction between differential forms and vector-fields. Then it no longer makes sense to say that forms have 'lines'. So, if you look at the differential form xdy in three space, the integral along any closed path if that path is the boundary of a surface, is teh signed area of the projection of that surface to the x,y plane. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nYou are used to integrating something looking like ydx in calculus, to get the area between a curve and the x axis. But ydx is an example of a differential form on 3 space, it can be integrated around any closed loop, and if that loop surrounds the 'area under a curve' in the plane, you already know it is telilng you the area. (the integral of ydx versus xdy around a closed loop are negatives of each other since the sum xdy+ydx=d(xy) is exact).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIt is tempting to identify the form ydx with the vector-field whose directional derivative operator is y \\partial/\\partial x, but that identification depends on believing in a notion that it makes sense universally to say \"the x,y,z axes are perpendicular\".\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nThe vector field y\\partial/\\partial x can be integrated so there is a curve through each point of 3 space, it is a parametrized curve and just goes in the x direction with speed y.   \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBUt the differential form ydx cannot be 'integrated' into 'lines' like that unless we believe that there is a pairing under which dx paired with \\partial/\\partial x is 1, and dx paired with \\partial\\partial y is 0, etcetera etceter, whic is linear with respect to function multiplication.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nWell, I've rambled too much, but your observation that it is severely lacking for someone to say that the behaviour of particles into what look like lines just self-evidently describes field lines of a magnetic field, shows a high degree of insight and integrity and inspired me to write a bit about differential forms and vector-fields.",

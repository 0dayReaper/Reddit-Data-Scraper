DVA continues to evolve and drift but the species have reached a point where the morphology is just works well and evolution away from the current \"design\" is maladaptive.   \n\nYou could say that they are at an endpoint of convergent evolution.  The many species of lobster and crayfish are another example.  Many freshwater species have evolved separately for very long periods in disconnected in river basins but have converged on remarkably similar morphological features.  At the dna level and in some not-critical features species can be quite different.",

Like adding a random piece of of a bed to the Mars rover is probably going to interfere with it's operation, adding a dolphin gene to a shark's biochemistry is very likely to cause problem.  Individual genes aren't morphological attributes, they are one cog in huge complex interactive system that ends up producing those attributes.    One of the big unsung results of gene splicing technologies is that it is rare to get something that works at all, let alone better.  (These odysseys of failure don't make captivating science news articles.)\n\nMutations are occurring all the time anyway.  Statistically, it's going to be more effective to test them en masse, in situ, as they happen, rather than sit around waiting for a highly unlikely bit of actually useful DNA to arrive by a tenuous process.  This can occur, but there's a hell of a survivor bias.",

                            "comment": "You ask, \"It is really counter intuitive, that the genes would keep evolving but without changing its morphology :S\"\n\nIt isn't really.  Imagine for example a cycle over months or years (depending on the life-span of the organism).  Imagine, for example, that it gets hotter, then colder, then hotter again.  During hot times some traits will be selected and during cold times other ones will be selected.  But the cycle repeats and doesn't last long, so though there are genetic changes, they do not end up adding up to a big change.\n\nYou can imagine the same thing in terms of cycles of food availability or oxygen levels or predation.   During one part of the cycle X is selected for.  During another Y is selected for---and if this repeats over and over quickly enough so that genes are not drastically diminished in the gene pool, you will not end up with large changes.\n\nBut it isn't that evolution stopped--it is that the selective forces are small and swinging back and forth like a pendulum.\n\nTo illustrate:\n\nA way of illustrating natural selection for grade schoolers is to do something like take a rug (say an orange shag rug) and spray paint a bunch of dried beans in various colors.  Then have the kids pick up as many beans as they can find.  Then shake out those not found, and duplicate all those colors.  Then repeat.  What you find, of course, is that the colors begin to match the rug in just a generation or two.\n\nWe can modify this to illustrate the point I was making above. Imagine changing the color of the rug from Red to Orange, and just keep going back and forth.  If your sample is large enough, you will not run out of either color of bean.  When the rug is red, the red beans survive more.  When it is orange the orange ones survive more often.  And so your average over many trials is not going to change much.  \n\n\nOf course, color isn't generally preserved in the fossil record, but I only used color because it is easy to visualize.  The same is true of morphological structures (for example, imagine blindfolded kids on the carpet trying to find spiky vs soother balls on various textures of carpet or on a carpet with various spiky or smooth distracting-objects).",

            "comment": "The animals you talk about have not been unchanged (in the sense you're talking about) for longer than most other animals (and you definitely don't mean just millions of years, even elephants have remained relatively \"unchanged\" for [millions of years morphologically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeoloxodon_recki)). \n\n\n###Aligators and Crocodiles (neosuchia)\n\nAligators actually only came onto the scene[ 37 million years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator), and the common ancestor between the aligator and caiman split after the cretaceous mass extinction event, 50+ million years ago. \n\nThe common ancestor between aligators and crocodiles appeared [80+ million years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodilia#Evolution) ago, which, in terms of what you're talking about, is a very recent period of time, as typically when people talk about these groups of animals being \"unchanged\" they are talking about *hundreds* of millions of years.  By the same metric, birds have roughly been unchanged for the same amount of time (80+ million years) though we certainly see a wide diversity of them, and we don't talk about birds being \"stuck in time\". \n\nIf we look at [crocodilamorpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodylomorpha), it existed well into the Triassic period, over 200 million years ago.  At the same time, the group used to be much more diverse.  Land crocodiles, which [*convergentley re-evolved* multiple times, including after the KT extinction prior to mammals taking over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planocraniidae)\n\n[Fully aquatic crocodilamorphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalattosuchia), originally taking much of the niche of today's dolphins and mosasaurs, again, [re-evolving even more recently past KT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyrosauridae) extinction (but not as derived).   \n\nAdditionally one of, if not the largest *neosuchian* crocodiliamorph to ever exist lived *after* the KT extinction, [Purrasaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purussaurus)(20-&gt;5 million years ago) , and two other large ones, [Ramphosuchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhamphosuchus) (5 -&gt; 2 million years ago) and [Gryposuchus]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gryposuchus) also lived later (though not as big) (20-&gt;5 million years ago).  Purrasaurus in particular was a caiman, and defintely did not start out as large as it was. Indeed none of these neosuchians did. \n\nThen you have the fish eating neosuchians, [like the Gharials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gharial), which certainly do not look like the rest of the neosuchians (other aligators and crocodiles), and fill a different niche despite still being  semi-aquatic.  Additionally these species *also* evolved after the KT extinction event. In fact, a *lot* of lineages evolved after the KT extinction event.  They didn't remain unchanged, they [*changed back into forms that previously existed, and into new forms for new niches*\n]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodilia#Relationships).  They were not stagnant, and *still* aren't stagnant.  We may yet see another marine crocodile from a lineage of saltwater crocodiles.  With out [river dolphins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_dolphin), we may see a new type of gharial like caiman.  \n\n### Cockaroaches\n\nCockroaches similarly have not just been sitting around doing nothing for the last 300 million years.  Roaches [have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaptica_dubia) a [high](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar_hissing_cockroach) amount of [modern diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therea_petiveriana) eg  and aren't just all brown insects of the same coloration and shape.  Infact, despite claims that they have been unchanged since before the dinosaurs, cockroaches first evolved in the early Jurassic some &lt;200 million years ago, and devloped internal ovipositors (things they lay eggs with) around 100+ million years ago.  Additionally cockroaches gave rise to termiites ([potentially 150 million years ago but this is debated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockroach)), and termites, like ants, have a wide variety of body plans and organizational structures.  Most of the species you see today have evolved recently, even if body plans are similar to those from tens of millions of years before.  \n\n### Sharks\n\nSharks have also not been idle.  Hammer head sharks, for example, evolved [20+ million years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerhead_shark), megalodon was the largest carnivorous shark [*ever*, and it existed 23 to 3.6 million years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalodon).  And like crocodiles, shark like ancestors, that weren't sharks, first evolved 450 million years ago, and \"modern sharks\" evolved during the jurassic ~200 million years ago (actually there's a theme here with the jurassic, there are other animal lineages that also come from after the triassic, jurassic mass extinction event).  Sharks themselves occupy a variety of niches and fit a variety of body plans, in addition to the sharks I mentioned there's also the [whale shark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark),[ horn shark \n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_shark) and [spotted wobbegong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotted_wobbegong) which do not fit the typical \"unchanged shark shape\".  In addition, much of our ideas of \"unchanged sharks\" could come from a mysterious diversity reducing event that wiped out [90% of shark species nearly 20 million years ago](https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/shark-blog/2021/06/sharks-were-almost-wiped-out-in-a-mysterious-event-19-million-years-ago-could-it-happen-again/). \n\n### Conclusion\n\nSuffice it to say, **none** of the modern animals in these groups we see today are \"close enough\" to be the same species as animals from hundreds of millions of years ago, and are not \"unchanged\" in the slightest.  There's a wide diversity in each of these groups. \n\nThat isn't to say there aren't *some* outliers in the animal world where this *might* apply, for example, the [sturgeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_sturgeon) and the [paddle fish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_paddlefish) were not thought to be all that close, being separated [by 184 million years](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/15/science/hybrid-sturgeon-paddlefish.html), especially not close enough to hybridize, and were kept together on the assumption they wouldn't breed (they were trying to see if they could get sturgeons to asexually reproduce), surprising scientists when [they, in fact, could hybridize](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7397225/).  But as you can see, the two animals aren't particularly morphological similar, though I believe the hybrids are still thought to be sterile.",

However, it's often more successful to pass along most of the genes instead of all of them. The loss of fidelity is made up for in improvements in volume. This is why sexual reproduction is a thing. You could see sexual reproduction as an evolved trait to boost the long term 'fitness' of a 'set' of genes. \n\n\nHowever, most mutations are not beneficial, and so, especially in long-lived creatures, this would be counter productive. Short-lived creatures like cockroaches don't need to worry about this so much, and so you could have what you propose in these types of creatures. However, ultimately, if genes are not good at replicating themselves, then these genes won't last very long. It's the type of question that can only be answered by research",

There are species concepts requiring the same genetic profile, the same morphological traits, etc. \nSo the question definitely does not boil down to could they produce viable offspring. \n1) This is not what is being asked because OP is asking about morphology vs. genetic similarity when it comes to defining a species. For example, morphologically they would look relatively the same according to their skeletal structure (which is what is left in the fossil record), so they would be considered the same species according to the morphological species concept. Biological species concept only applies to species that we have DNA of and thus can see shared DNA and/or observe shared traits in the fossil record. \n2) they could definitely still mate and have an offspring, just like a lion and tiger could mate and produce a liger. However, their offspring would likely not be viable (meaning they could not produce offspring themselves) as we see with all ligers being sterile. Barriers to mating occur when the species physically unable to mate due to incompatible morphological differences between genitalia and/or genetically do not produce offspring when they do mate. This is when the biological species concept comes into play.\nDepending on what species concept that you use, they would or would not be considered the same species. Because we do not have DNA for the fossils of these species we cannot test the biological species concept, thus we tend to only consider their morphology (usually skeletal) and geological time to create species.",

After megaladons died (something made them not able to able to produce enough offspring to survive anymore, no longer apex), whales including orcas could grow into what they are today. \n\nHumans are top of orcas too. Once an apex predator, not always an apex predator. \n\nRegarding the question on humans being prey or predators. They pretty much always have been both, but now you are only prey if you live or walk where large predatory animals live - bears, lions, etc. \n\n\nFor any evolution regarding humans or absolutely anything else, there has to first be a mutation in a baby/new life. If that mutation is bad, then it leads to a lot of genetic disorders we see, but most bad mutations cause the foetus to die well before birth. \n\n\nIf there is a \u201cgood\u201d mutation though, and this gets into a bit of the population, these creatures may find it easier to survive before producing their own children. If this means this sub population now has better survivability and more kids than the larger population, then over time that sub population will replace everyone else - through competing for the same resources, fighting, cannibalism, etc. Evolutionary pressures drive these adaptations - so unless a mutation changes survivability or \u201cfitness\u201d (how many kids you have), that mutation might get passed on but won\u2019t hit the population meaningfully. It might result in segments of the population being more resistant to certain diseases though - thats a big reason why with a big enough population even the most destructive diseases don\u2019t kill everyone. \n\n\nExamples of where other forces have been strongon evolution has are where you might have Species 1, and they are geologically isolated.  Everyone happy. \n\n\nOne day, through erosion of the mountains, sea levels rising, flying to a random unpopulated island, or another reason that allows the species to interact with other species or other environments, this species may be less survivable in Location 2, as new nuts may require a better shaped beak, or in Location 1, as  new spices introduced now compete with Species 1.\n\n\nThat better beak or brainier brains don\u2019t just magically appear - they are simply random mutations happening, and only the ones that change fitness will succeed and pass on this mutation. And whilst some mutations might make the bird brainier, it\u2019s the better beak they need to be more fit. And for humans in an ever changing pre modern world, only the brainier were successful as this allowed things like language and tool making. We will have had some mutations for a jaw better at eating nuts too, but after a while these benefits would not have led to those people being more fit, and others would out-compete them.\n\n\nThat\u2019s just high level non-specific stuff but the gist is right.",

But that pressure can come from many different sources, it doesn't necessarily have to be something in the outside environment changing, it can be a series of random mutations that makes some members of the species more effective at something than others over time.\n\nFor example, the peacock. Peacocks have evolved to have the males grow larger and larger display feathers due to sexual selection. Males with more impressive displays were able to mate more than males with less impressive displays, so as the generations go by, the display structures keep getting bigger and bigger. This actually makes them less able to navigate their environments, escape predators, etc., and takes more energy to grow and maintain, but apparently those downsides are outweighed by being a more desirable mate by having larger feathers, up to a certain point. No one had to make any conscious decisions for this to happen.\n\nSo similarly, maybe some trait in australopithecus made some individuals more intelligent / able to gather more food than other australopithecus, and over thousands of generations the ones that were able to get more food become more and more heavily represented in the gene pool, and the population keeps trending in that direction even if no outside factors changed.\n\nI'm sure the first hominids to create stone tools quickly outcompeted all the other hominids around because they were able to get at tougher foods and begin to kill larger prey more easily, again could happen without a specific new outside pressure.",

Fossils are not going to pick up on small behavioral changes, for example.  It is basically saying, \"If we went back millions of years, you would recognize a shark and it would look to you just like sharks today.\"    \n\n\nAs far as why this happens, when an animal is very well suited for its niche there is little evolutionary pressure.  Given the current body plan, such a well-suited organism isn't going to change much.  No doubt some evolution is still occurring (it is unlikely that gene frequences remain the same from generation to generation) but there is not significant enough evolutionary pressure for big changes.    \n\n\nThe oldest DNA fragments found are like 2 million years old, but finding such DNA is very rare and takes very special conditions.",

            "comment": "While it is often stated that animals like cockroaches, sharks, and   \nalligators have remained unchanged for millions of years, it is an   \noversimplification. While they may exhibit morphological traits   \nreminiscent of their ancient ancestors, these animals have undergone   \ngenetic changes and diversification over time, just like any other   \nliving organism. They share common characteristics with their ancestors,  \n but they have also accumulated genetic variations and adaptations.   \nAdditionally, it's important to note that when we talk about their   \nunchanged status, we refer to broader taxonomic categories rather than   \nindividual species. While the overall groups of these animals have   \npersisted for millions of years, individual species have evolved and   \ndifferentiated. So, while they have similarities to their ancient   \ncounterparts, they are not exactly the same genetically or   \nmorphologically.",

All the cell phones stop working (they go extinct) and the old guy with the landline still can call people.\n\nThe alligator is the 1923 Ford Tractor out in the barn.

That would be like hot springs bacteria. Crocodiles and the like are probably changing a bit, but that they haven\u2019t gone extinct altogether is remarkable.",

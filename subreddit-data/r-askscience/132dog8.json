    "postText": "I'm trying to write a paper on duck reproduction and most of the research I can find is from over 10 years ago. Although many articles write about the shape and evolutionary strategies of the corkscrew shape of duck genitalia, I can only find one study that even comes close to addressing how effective this strategy actually is?\n\nThat study being Explosive eversion and functional morphology of the duck penis supports sexual conflict in waterfowl genitalia. by Brennan PL, Clark CJ, Prum RO. *DOI:*\u00a0[***10.1098/rspb.2009.2139***](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2009.2139)\n\nIn addition, the New York Times wrote: *To support her argument, Dr. Brennan notes studies on some species that have found that forced matings make up about a third of all matings. Yet only 3 percent of the offspring are the result of forced matings. \u201cTo me, it means these females are successful with this strategy,\u201d she said.* \"In Ducks, War of the Sexes Plays Out in the Evolution of Genitalia\" in 2007, but I can't find where she got this statistic from or any research that supports it.",

            "comment": "It sounds like you're confusing [sidereal time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidereal_time) with [solar time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_time).  A sidereal day is the amount of time it takes for the Earth to rotate by 360\u00b0, and is indeed 23h56m4s.  A solar day is the interval between two successive instances of the Sun crossing the [local meridian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_\\(astronomy\\)).  Since the Earth moves by roughly 1\u00b0 around the Sun each day, the Earth has to rotate by roughly 361\u00b0 for the Sun to cross the local meridian.  In [this image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sidereal_day_\\(prograde\\).png), sidereal time is the difference between the blue circles labelled \"1\" and \"2\", where solar time is the difference between the blue circles labelled \"1\" and \"3\".",

In the course of a year, all the little furthers add up to one more orbit, so it takes about 13/12 times longer between full moons compared to going 360\u00b0 around earth.",

They got the 360\u00b14 days number, which is relatively close to 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 = 360\n- and they already considered the 3 x 4 x 5 = 60 a pretty magic number (roughly how we consider 100 a significant number today) so surely that cannot be a coincidence, it must mean something! \n\nSo the sumerians picked a 360 days year, and decreed that the remaining 5 days are outside of the year, so why work then if nobody counted interest on loans during those  days (by religious decree), let's spent 5 days partying, drinking, and celebrating the new year! \n\nAnd this is why we have 360 degrees around the circle - one degree is the distance covered by the Earth around the sun during one day.

It's mostly due to the force of the sun's gravity decreasing as the sun burns its mass into light and radiates it into space. This is the only source I've read on the topic, to give you an accurate sense of how little I actually know about it personally:\n\nhttp://curious.astro.cornell.edu/about-us/41-our-solar-system/the-earth/orbit/83-is-the-distance-from-the-earth-to-the-sun-changing-advanced\n\n&gt;The Sun is powered by nuclear fusion, which means the Sun is continuously transforming a small part of its mass into energy. As the mass of the Sun goes down, our orbit gets proportionally bigger. However, over the entire main sequence lifetime of the Sun (about 10 billion years), the Sun will only lose about 0.1% of its mass, which means that the Earth should move out by just ~150,000 km (small compared to the total Earth-Sun distance of ~150,000,000 km). If we assume that the Sun's rate of nuclear fusion today is the same as the average rate over those 10 billion years (a bold assumption, but it should give us a rough idea of the answer), then we're moving away from the Sun at the rate of ~1.5 cm (less than an inch) per year. I probably don't even need to mention that this is so small that we don't have to worry about freezing.",

This adjustment also takes into account the fact that the earth is significantly tilted relative to it's orbit.\n\nBy construction, sundials measure \"apparent solar time\" i.e. the time according to the position of the sun, with solar noon (12 on a sundial) always being the time when the sun is exactly on the meridian of the sundial (i.e. directly on the line from North to South). \n\nThe difference between the actual length of each solar day and the average solar day (24 hours) varies quite a lot by season, and has to be added or subtracted to the time on a sundial (the apparent solar time) to get the measured time that humans use, where each day is defined to be 24 hours long. It can vary by around -14 to +16 minutes. The way this is calculated is called [the equation of time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time).",

It's like that.  Try it with differently sized coins. Imagine the coin you're rotating is earth and that the top of it is where you live. It's noon when the top of the coin faces the sun and midnight at the bottom. \n\nAbout half a year from now, the sun will be on the other side of the earth. At that point, if we have done an whole number of full rotations (these are the 23h56m periods mentioned in the post), it will be night where it used to be day. The extra 4 minutes is the time it takes earth's rotation to catch up to the sun's new position in the sky. ",

Over the course of its orbit, while we track the rotation of midday (by keeping it the same throughout - it doesn't swap over to night half way through the year, because we have factored that into our timing), you end up having spun less than you expect because you've been spinning in the opposite direction to keep track.\n\nThe end result is that one affects the other, and that the Sun does not look like a fried egg when drawn in such a way.",

So, after one trip around the sun, Earth has rotated about its axis 1 time, but you subtract 1 to get the number of \"days\" you experience, which is 0.\n\nThe same principle holds true if the Earth rotated 2 times while orbiting the sun once.  Now, if you picture Earth after a half orbit about the sun, the opposite side of Earth will be facing the sun (so half a day had passed), and after a full orbit a whole day has passed.  You have done 2 rotations, but experienced 1 day.\n\nThe same holds true for any number of rotations during one orbit, and in Earth's case it's about 366.25.",

That means that 1 day now lasts 1 YEAR as the earth orbits around the sun.  The sun now also moves from west to east, but VERY slowly!  So at the end of the year you're \"losing\" 1 day as the sun has traveled backward in relation to what we currently experience with East-to-West sun movement.  So the earth has actually rotated approximately 366 times during a year, but we only experience 365 cycles of the Sun rising and setting.\n\nIf you want more information, look up Solar days vs Sidereal days.",

A solar day (the time it takes for the sun to reach the same angle in the sky) is about 24 hours (give or take a few seconds on certain days, considering the earth moves at different speeds at different parts of its ellipse).\n\nLeap years are a different kettle of fish. You see, the speed at which the earth rotates, and the speed at which it revolves around the sun are not connected, and the solar year is 365d5h48m46s (which is 11m14s less than 365.25 days) so we accumulate nearly a quarter of a day (to be specific, 24.219907407407407407407407407407%) per year, which would mean over time, our calendar would slip and we'd end up with summer in the northern hemisphere for christmas! over the course of 100 years, autumn would begin to creep into august, and spring into January, as the seasons shifted over by 24 days. So, we could add an extra day ever 4 years to fix it right? However, since the solar year is 11m14s shorter than that .25, we're now shifting 11m14s a year in the other direction. in 128 years, we'd be one day off. So we do better by NOT including an extra day on years divisible by 100. But we also knew we could do better, so we made an exception to that rule: If the year was divisible by 400 it WOULD be a Leap Year. Now it will take 3300 years to diverge for the calendar year and solar year to converge by a single day!",

We actually had to change it a while back to account for the fact that its slightly less the 365 1/4 \n\nHeres a better explanation...\n\nThe exact length of a solar year is actually 11 minutes and 14 seconds less than 365 \u00bc days. That means that even if you add a leap day every four years, the calendar would still overshoot the solar year by a little bit\u201411 minutes and 14 seconds per year. These minutes and seconds really start to add up: after 128 years, the calendar would gain an entire extra day. So, the leap year rule, \"add a leap year every four years\" was a good rule, but not good enough!\n\nCalendar Correction, Part II\n\nTo rectify the situation, the creators of our calendar (the Gregorian calendar, introduced in 1582) decided to omit leap years three times every four hundred years. This would shorten the calendar every so often and rid it of the annual excess of 11 minutes and 14 seconds. So in addition to the rule that a leap year occurs every four years, a new rule was added: a century year is not a leap year unless it is evenly divisible by 400. This rule manages to eliminate three leap years every few hundred years.\n\nhttps://www.infoplease.com/leap-year-101-next-when-list-days-calendar-years-calculation-last-rules",

People were aware of the seasonal drift literally since the invention of calendars, because the solstices and equinoxes didn't fall on the same day every year. You can pretty easily calculate solstices and equinoxes with primitive equipment - for example, if you simply erect a big pole and then mark where its shadow falls on a direct north-south line every day, the extremes of that shadow will be on the winter and summer solstices. Many ancient temples, such as Chichen Itza, were built in alignment to the sun rising on the equinoxes.\n\nWhen your civilization advances enough to create a yearly calendar, you'll note that over time, the summer and winter solstices no longer fall on the same day. So you add some days to make them match up again. Then you'll figure out that you seem to be losing about one day per four years, so you'll add a day per four years. That'll work for longer, then you'll realize that you're gaining about a day per hundred years. You'll fix that, and then about a thousand years later you'll realize you're losing a day per four hundred years. That's where things stand as of today. :)",

            "comment": "A lot of people are pointing out the difference between sidereal days and solar days, but there's an important piece to a proper answer that's (mostly) being neglected: leap days are to fix the disparity between how long it takes for the Earth to *revolve* around the sun once (8766.15 hours (+/-, depending on which definition you're using)) and how many hours are in 365 solar days (8760). That 6.15 hour disparity is what's corrected with leap days. Without Feb. 29, seasons would slowly (but noticeably) shift. Across a single lifetime, the winter solstice (in the north) could work its way to November. Leap days do *not* address anything related to how the Earth *rotates* on its axis (aside from the fact that that's how we count days).\n\nIf there really was a ~4 minute disparity between a 24 hour \"day\" and a 23h56m4s *solar* day, then you'd notice that the sun would rise/set earlier and earlier. In three months, you'd get sunrise at midnight and sunset at noon. Three more months, sunrise at 6pm and sunset at 6am.  \nThis clearly doesn't happen, and it's because a solar day really is (on average) almost exactly 24 hours. (See all the other answers about sidereal days vs solar days to explain where 23h56m4s comes from).\n\nOn a parting note, I want to actually answer \"where does that extra [time] go?\" Each year, it goes into the changing night sky. The constellations shift with the seasons *exactly* the way the sun would in my hypothetical scenario above. If you could see Orion even during the day, and you kept careful track, you'd notice that it rises and sets 36**6** times while the sun only rises and sets 365 times.",

The earth takes slightly shorter than 24 hours for one revolution. \n\nHowever, after one rotation, it also has progressed on its orbit around the sun.  So after one full rotation, the sun is not in the same position. If you wait a bit longer (for a total of almost exactly24h), the sun is in the same position again.\n\nThe leap day has nothing to do with earth's rotation, it has to do with the time it takes to orbit the sun. The earth needs 365 and 1/4 (rounded) days to orbit the sun. The leap day keeps the year aligned with the orbit around the sun. Without the leap day, the seasons would slowly shift (at a rate of roughly 1 month every 120 years).",

That is, the time taken for the Earth to rotate once with respect to the background stars. But the calendar works by *solar* days, which are actually 24 hours (at least on average).\n\nNotice how the difference (3 minutes and 56 seconds every day) is almost exactly enough to add up to one extra day each year. That's because the Earth goes around the Sun once per year, so the rate at which its solar days 'fall behind' has to come to one full day each year. (To illustrate, imagine if the Earth didn't rotate at all relative to the background stars. We would still get exactly 1 solar day each year.)\n\nLeap day has nothing to do with the 3-minute-56-second discrepancy. It's due entirely to the fact that we insist on having the new calendar year start at midnight, and the discrepancy between the (non-integer) number of solar days in a year and the (integer) number of days on our calendar.",

If the day weren't 24 hours then after a period of months the Sun would be in the sky at midnight, or it would be dark at noon.\n\nThe year is not a full integer multiple number of days in length, however. And that would cause the seasons to shift their timing in the year over time. Which was what happened when the Julian calendar was in use. The Gregorian calendar adds or skips leap days in such a way that it takes about 3000 years for the timing of the seasons to be off by a day (which can be fixed with ad hoc leap days or skipping leap days, should civilization continue that long).\n\nThe difference you're talking about is the difference between the solar day and the sidereal day, or when the sun appears at the same place in the sky versus when the stars appear at the same place in the sky. What you'll find is that it is roughly 1/365th of a day shorter than a solar day.

For that we have one of two options, we can use the object it's orbiting, or we can use far away stars. \n\nIn the first case you get synodic time, and since the earth is orbiting the sun, synodic time for our little rock is usually referred to as solar time. \n\nIn the second case you get sidereal time. \n\nFor the purposes of calendars and tracking seasons and blah blah all that every day use, we use solar time, not sidereal time. The mean solar day is defined exactly as 24 hours (or rather 86 400 SI seconds but whatever). However since a year is given by earth's rotation around the sun, we end up with a small time shortage on the calendar day since it takes about 365.24 solar days for the earth to complete one orbit. Since the calendar date is supposed to represent earth's position in it's orbit and thus the change of seasons caused by distance to the sun and blah blah etc  that .24 would cause the calendar to drift. Thus leap years. \n\nnow sidereal time is mostly of use to astronomers and other folks who like looking at stars. It also gives us a \"better\" true day because the earths motion around the sun slightly extends the solar day by a little under 4 minutes in comparison to the sidereal period of motion. However this does not affect the calendar because our calendar isn't based off sidereal time. ",

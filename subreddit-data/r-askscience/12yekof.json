So the Moon can affect the Earth's rotation, and the Earth can affect the Moon's orbit, on a much shorter timescale than any significant changes to the Earth-Sun system would occur on.",

If earth and moon were pointlike particles, then as long as the moon's total energy is not too high, it would always stay in a stable orbit. \n\nThe fact that the moon's orbit changes hinges on it having a volume. Different parts of the moon would have different orbits around earth, in particular with different orbital periods, but they are all forced into the same orbit by the gravitational pull of all the neighboring moon particles. It's this interaction which changes the orbit over time. Though even here, the changing orbit tends towards a stable one which will be achieved at some point far in the future. And this does not depend on where exactly in the gravity well the moon starts (though every suitable starting configuration has its own stable orbit in the end).",

There are dozens of other solar systems we have found where the planets have pulled on each other until they fell into an orbital resonance. \n\nAssuming no disruptions and the star lives long enough, this is the eventual state that every solar system will fall into. Our solar system is taking a long time because of how far apart the planets are compared to most other solar systems, although be aware there is a measurement bias making exoplanets close to their star easier to detect.\n\nExample:\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gliese_876",

However, in our solar system's case it helps that so much of the entire mass of the solar system is concentrated in the Sun (about [99.8% in fact](https://mobile.arc.nasa.gov/public/iexplore/missions/pages/solarsystem/sun.html).) Because the planets are also relatively far apart we can, to a reasonable first approximation, treat the orbit of each planet as a two-body problem of just that planet + the Sun, which does have a closed form and will be very stable over long periods of time.",

The part of each body facing the other is pulled more strongly by gravity than the past facing away because it is closer. As the bodies rotate, this bulge moves to the side a bit, but is still pulled by gravity toward the other body because it bulges out a little closer. This produces a torque against rotation and slows down the rotation. It also acts like a gravitational slingshot, speeding up the orbits around each other (energy transfers from axial rotation to orbital speed). However a lot of this energy is lost rather than transferred, used instead to mush the body around to cause the bulge and usually converted to heat. So it isn't a straight conservation of momentum equation.\n\nThe Moon has slowed its rotation so much it has stopped relative to the Earth. It is tidally locked. The Earth isn't tidally locked so it will continue having its rotation slowed by the Moon. It will also keep speeding up the Moon's orbit, causing the orbit to expand. \n\nTidal Locking can fail if the gravity is too small to make a tidal bulge of significance. It can fail if the rotational speed of the body is so fast, the bulge can't form or the rear bulge rotates around to reverse the torque (no molten core can cause these non-moving tides). Multi-body systems can also mess things up by making other bulges with reverse torques which is a big reason why the Earth-Moon system is less affected by the Sun while Mercury and Venus have had their rotation heavily slowed by the Sun.",

The length of time it takes the earth to complete an orbit around the sun is not directly tied to the number of rotations the earth itself makes. \n\nThe earth could be spinning twice as fast and it wouldn't necessarily take a different amount of time to orbit the sun. \n\nIt's a bit confusing because we tie the two things together (365.25 days in a year), but they really aren't that tightly related.  \n\nSo, having said that the days were shorter back in Jurassic times, doesn't mean that earth took \"more days\" to go around the sun. At least not by our current definition of a day/year.\n\nThe relationship  between a Jurrasic day and a Jurrasic year would have different definitions compared to today. The year would be very close to the same as today, but as noted earlier the days would have been a bit shorter.  \n\nSo, yes, the math would show that a Jurrasic Year had more Jurrasic Days than a modern year has modern days, but empirically the year would have been the same duration as it is today.",

For example, we believe the Earth dynamo is in a subcritical state which means it can sustain its large scale field but it could not restart it if it was stopped. If it is sub critical now it must have always been sub critical and so must have existed at the time of impact. Any impact scenario that can not reproduce this must then be wrong. \n\nWe can play this same game with various other properties of the Earth-Moon system to apply more constraints on the nature of the impact.",

So here goes, for the day length at least.\n\nDuring the Jurassic Era, roughly 200 million to 145 million years ago, a \u201cday\u201d as in one complet rotation of the Earth around its axis, would have been a bit shorter at around 23 hours, compared to the current average of 24 hours or 86,400 seconds (give or take a few milliseconds). The basic reason for the difference would be the moon\u2019s orbit creating an *extremely* gradual braking force on the Earth\u2019s rotation. This means we gain a tiny tiny fraction of a second to the length of the day each year, averaged out over *millennia.*\n\nAs for the year, well how are we counting? We just changed the length of a \u201cday\u201d so we need an unchanged unit for a reference point.\n\nWe established the day was shorter, which means subjectively the year, as in one complete orbit around the Sun, was more of those shorter days. That would make the Jurassic Year about 381 Jurassic Days.\n\nBut objectively, it probably took about the same number of *hours* to orbit the Sun, assuming all the other factors affecting the Earth\u2019s orbit were roughly the same. But that\u2019s getting beyond what I can say.",

Neglecting all other effects such as tides and just considering the Solar mass loss, the Earth will migrate from 1 AU to about 5AU between now to the end of the red giant phase. This would put us where Jupiter is.\n\nTides will counteract this and cause Earth to migrate inwards at a rate faster than the mass loss though. This was tenuously determined in the 90s when tides were accounted for. However, recent work suggests those estimates underestimated the rate of tidal migration.",

The Moon becomes dynamically unstable at twice the Hill radius which is significantly closer than how far the Moon would have to migrate for the Earth to become tidally locked to it. There is no 3-body tidal equilibrium state for the Sun-Earth-Moon system.\n\nI would also note a subtlety here. When a system is tidally locked, or lets be even more strict and say in tidal equilibrium, tides still exist! It is simply that there is no longer a phase lag between the tidal forcing and the tidal response. As such no migration can occur as there is a symmetry in the tidal potential of the perturbed bodies which results in no net torque on either the spins or the orbits of either. But the tide still is there!",

The remaining tidal effects will be in the water vapor rich atmosphere and have minimal ongoing effects on the rotation of the planet and the orbit of the moon.\n\nBut since this event will also likely mean the end of the entire carbon cycle on earth, nobody will be around to care.",

Given enough time, the Earth will become tidally locked to the Moon so only one side of the Earth will face the Moon, but still the Earth will continue to rotate.\n\nEdit: As some people have pointed out, this is not entirely accurate. I have ignored/assumed certain things for simplicity. For example, the aging Sun may disrupt the Earth/Moon long before the Earth can become tidally locked to the Moon. And if that doesn't happen, as the Moon drifts further away from Earth its orbit will eventually be disrupted by the gravitational influence of the Sun. And once that happens, the Earth will eventually become tidally locked to the remnants of the Sun. Even then, the Earth will still \"rotate\" at least in the sense that its rotation will synchronize with its orbit around the Sun.",

They were going to use it to show the earth doesn't rotate on it's axis. Except it showed that it was changing position by 15 degrees each hour, which it would do if it was on a rotating, round earth.\n\nThen they devised some kind of test with two walls with holes in them and placed them far enough apart that the curvature of the earth would change the angle you needed to aim the light to shine through both holes. And that's what happened.\n\nThey dismissed both results as erroneous because they didn't match the desired results.",

Space is, radiologically, a pretty noisy place, and even on earth those radio waves were hardly perfect fidelity.\n\nI\u2019ve also read that the first significant television broadcast was of the 1936 Olympics, and specifically Hitler opening the games. It\u2019s an interesting thought experiment, imagining a spaceship a few light-decades away catching the grand diesel punk opera that is the 20th century. Imagine the first season of a show being World War 2. On the other hand, without our proximity to it, would it even be interesting to watch?\n\nOn any kind of significant timeline, I\u2019m increasingly having trouble believing we\u2019ll still be around. The Anthropocene, to the extent it is ever known by intelligent life after us, will likely be thought of primarily as the weird layer of the geologic record where radioactivity jumps a bit, right at that thin smear of micro plastics that nearly uniformly covered the planet for the blink of a geologic eye.",

Of that, as a planet, we\u2019ve only been broadcasting on our presence for about 120 years. Maybe a little more if you include noise from thinks like power lines and transformers.

So it would result in one rotation of the earth for each revolution around the sun.\n\nTidal locking involves one side of an object constantly facing the body it orbits. So for the earth to cease rotating, the sun-facing side of the earth would need to change slowly through the year.\n\nBut honestly, its imposible for an object in the universe to completely stop rotating, since there's always a larger body to orbit and it is all just frames of reference anyways.",

If you neglect the evolution of the bodies in question and just consider the 3 body problem including tides then what happens is the Moon migrates outwards until about twice the Hill radius where the influence of the Sun becomes important. At this point the Moons orbit becomes dynamically unstable and would eventually be stripped from the Earth. After this point the dominant influence on the Earth would be the Sun and hence it would tidally lock to the Sun. Keep running time forward and eventually the Sun would also tidally lock to the Earth and you would have a complete tidal equilibrium. Where did the Moon go? Either into the Sun, into the Earth, or out of the system.",

The earth's axis isn't straight up and down, it's actually off at an angle of 23 degrees. \n\nWhen we're on one side of the sun, that tilt points the bottom of the earth more directly at the sun (24hrs daylight in Antarctica), but if you move the earth to the other side of the sun and leave the tilt the same, now the top is pointing more directly at the sun (24hrs daylight in the arctic).  \n\nSo days get longer and shorter in an annual cycle as the tilted earth moves around the sun. It's the same reason the sun doesn't go directly above you when it moves from east to west each day, it follows an arc that changes depending on the time of year and your location because really you're standing on a tilted ball. \ud83d\ude09 \n\nLonger days caused by the moon slowing the Earth down aren't changing the tilt (as far as I know), and so days and nights will get longer by the same amount on average.... like normal, you'll just see more of them summer than in winter.",

            "comment": "It depends on how you count a day and how you count a year. Also the earth accelerates and decelerates around a middle area where sometimes the sun exists and sometimes the point the earth is moving around actually is just an empty point in space. It is very complicated. If you want a direct comparison like as if you instantly transported 200 million years into the past you'd find an Earth that had an orbit of 385 days around the sun and 23 hours of day/night cycle from rotation on our own planetary axis. Also the moon would be a lot closer to earth. The moon at its formation was 15,000\u201320,000 miles away, as opposed to the current average distance of 238,000 miles. Anyways, this all leaves a very complicated sticky mess that can simply be explained by an equation by someone smarter than myself instead of actually using unchangeable/static numbers. Since it's not as simple as day/night and orbital angular momentum.",

            "comment": "From what I understand after reading some comments is the time it took the earth to complete its orbit around the sun is roughly the same as it is now. The details of the terra-lunar system were different but its relationship to the sun has not changed, unless there were some interloping bodies whose evidence and effects are lost to the dirt.",

            "comment": "&gt;Was the year and day duration the same back in the Jurassic Era?\n\nYes, and no.\n\nBy definition, a day is 86400 seconds and the second is fixed at 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation produced by the transition between two levels of the cesium-133 atom.  Similarly, a year is 31.56 megaseconds.  So, yes.  These durations were the same in the Jurassic as they are now.\n\nHowever, if you're defining a day as the duration of the rotation of the Earth, and a year as the duration of the Earth's orbit, then no, they were different back in the Jurassic era.  Both the day and the year were probably shorter.  Tidal effects slowly bleed off energy by converting movements in the oceans and crust into friction and heat, which would radiate away into space.\n\nOh, and let's not forget a certain impact with a rather sizable chunk of interplanetary debris.  That would have thrown a bit of sand into the orbital mechanics.",

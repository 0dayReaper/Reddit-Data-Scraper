            "comment": "So much misunderstanding here it\u2019s difficult to know where to start. Not all dinosaurs went extinct some evolved and survived. But when that event did happen life itself continued in a multitude of ways , the comet didn\u2019t kill off \u2018life\u2019. We don\u2019t have the same dinosaurs now but we do have dinosaurs in as much as we have birds. In the same we we have the descendants  of other creatures that lived at that time and don\u2019t have descendants of those that dies out completely. This creators that were already well adapted to survive the changing environment they found themselves in or whose environment didn\u2019t change so much will have had less pressure to change.",

The dinosaurs were not the only organisms pre and post KT boundary. To give a few examples ..we have evolutionary descendents of avian dinosaurs,  the birds. We have crocodilians who lived before, during and after the dinos. Then we have us, the mammals who evolved in the jurassic, but we did take advantage of the ecological niches left when the large dinos were wiped out. Palaeontology ftw.",

            "comment": "So, as far as we know, there has *never* been a point where all life on Earth went extinct.  What's more, there's always lots of different kinds of life around, from mammals and reptiles and fish, to all the different kinds of plants and fungus and bacteria and so on.\n\nMass extinctions, like what killed most of the dinosaurs, kill off huge proportions of life on earth, but there have always been survivors.  Those survivors then evolve and diverge into new species to fill the ecological niches left behind (compare, for example, triceratops to bison.  Both are big, heavy herbivores with horns on their head for fighting over mates or self defense.  When animals like tirceratops died off, it left room for other animals to grow big and live the same way.)\n\nMammals already existed when most of the dinosaurs died off, and were mostly smaller nocturnal animals. \n Those mammals are our ancestors.  Similarly, the few species of dinosaurs that survived that extinction event are the ancestors of birds.  Other broad categories of animal, like sharks and crocodiles for example, survived the event without changing that much.\n\nAnd of course, life is more than just mammals.  Lots of kinds of plants went extinct at that time as well, and then the surviving plants evolved into what we know of today.  The same is true for lots of kinds of fungus, bacteria, sea life, etc.",

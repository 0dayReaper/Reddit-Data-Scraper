    "postText": "Could someone provide a detailed explanation of how the \"DishBrain\" described in Kagan et al. (2022) [1] communicates with cells, beyond a simple schematic overview?\nI'm more interested in the communication aspect than the growing of cells.\nAdditionally, are there any replications or similar experiments conducted?\n\nI'm a layman on the topic, but I'm willing to read up to understand in-depth answers.\n\nThank you!\n\n[1] B.

A red wriggler can live 5 years, and they reach maturity in under 60 days. That's 30 ish generations if all goes well.",

This means that species which are typically \"prey\" (or at least where their young are easily predated) will have a higher reproductive rate through a combination of more frequent breeding, larger pools of offspring, shorter gestational periods, and earlier maturation.\n\nFor example - elephants have an expected lifespan of 50-80 years, depending on species. Sea turtles have a typical life span of 50-100 years. Both will generally reach sexual maturity somewhere between 10-16 years old.\n\nElephants will be able to calf once every 2.5-7 years, and gestation takes almost 2 years (20-22 months). On the other hand, sea turtles will produce maybe 2000 eggs in their reproductive span... But a lot of the eggs won't make it to hatchlings because of predators, and the eggs that _do_ hatch... A lot of them won't survive the year, let alone the 16 or so years until maturity. Elephants don't really suffer from predation in the same way that sea turtles do, and the rates of reproduction largely reflect that.",

That's 42 generations.  Truly a precedent for Mickey's eternal copyright. \n\nPeople elsewhere in this thread mentioning rabbits are also on the money, European rabbits are also 4th highest on the list with 40 generations.\n\nMost of the high rankers are rodents, the highest larger animal is Cuvier's gazelle (36 generations).  There's also an elephant shrew pretty high up.  \n\nLong tailed shrews and marsupials dominate the bottom of the list, with generational overlap of less than 2.\n\nMost of the range seems to be between about 2 and 17 generations, looking at a real quick and dirty graph.  Variation in generation time decreases as lifespan increases.\n\nReader beware this is just mammals, and not even all mammals.",

All organisms (not just animals) I know of have some mechanism to increase genetic diversity in their population. With animals it's pretty much always genetic recombination, usually through sex, sometimes doing it themselves. A lot of single cell organisms just rely on the simpler mechanism of high mutation rates, though a fair number of them also have some parallel to sex too (even bacteria, even viruses).",

The species experienced a bottleneck during the last ice-age and is unusually genetically homogenous. \n\nAn impressive consequence of this is that cheetah can receive skin grafts from other cheetah without the need for immuno-suppressants as the hosts immune system will recognise the donor graft as self.\n\nModern research is starting to downplay the significance of the the ice-age bottle neck on the cheetah gene-pool with the selective pressure of the cheetahs extreme specialisation being thought to have a larger role in maintaining the homogeneity.

While you can certainly increase the frequency of harmful traits within a family line with incest, the opposite can also be true: you can increase the frequency of certain desired traits. For example, practically all the plants and animals that you eat are the results of massive amounts of inbreeding. They were inbred over and over again to manifest certain traits stronger and stronger.\n\n\nThe actual reason why incest is bad in humans has less to do with incest being inherently bad, but more because of human values. Inbreeding is only positive when those with harmful traits are removed from the system. For artificial breeding, it's accomplished by sterilizing and/or otherwise denying certain specimens from breeding. For inbreeding in nature, it's accomplished when natural selection happens and those with deleterious traits die before they can breed.\n\n\nFor obvious reasons, applying this rationale to humans would be met with horror and remembrance of *what happened during WWII in Nazi Germany.*",

Having said that it looks like they reach sexual maturity somewhere near 150 years of age and have a gestation period probably in the 8-18 YEAR range, which means even if they can hit 500 you are probably looking at only 4 generations around at any given moment.",

This does not seem to reduce the life expectancy or predatory ability of Greenland sharks, due to their strong reliance on smell and hearing.[",

It is in a basal group of multicellular animals, possible relatives of Cnidaria.\n\n&gt; Due to the possibility of its cloning itself by asexual propagation without limit, the life span of Placozoa is infinite; in the laboratory, several lines descended from a single organism have been maintained in culture for an average of 20 years without the occurrence of sexual processes.\n\nIf the lifespan is infinite, the generations in parallel is also potentially infinite, depending on the reproduction and lifestyle characteristics of the organism.\n\nThey generally reproduce asexually, by dividing or budding, but can also reproduce sexually. Asexually reproduced organisms can often be regarded as exact copies (\"clones\") of the parent, though whether this means they represent the same animal or a different animal is a matter of debate. It's unclear whether multicellular animals with undifferentiated cells are still considered a single animal, as opposed to one with cells specialised for specific functions. And that rule would apply regardless of whether the animal has an extracellular matrix which holds it together, or if the cells are allowed to float free, and so been a single 'diffuse' lifeform with identical DNA.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichoplax",

It has specialised cells but no organs. Offspring can only be identified separate from the parent by being physically separated from each other. As a collective they're able to live a long time, but so far as I know it doesn't have DNA repair to improve longevity.

    "postText": "Does [Neurofibromatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurofibromatosis) actually cause nerves to grow into the tumors it forms, or are the nerves stretched/pulled/moved/etc. from healthy flesh? Neurofibromas are apparently [nerve-sheath tumors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerve_sheath_tumor) which have \"Schwann cell differentiation and neoplastic proliferations\", but I don't know what exactly that terminology means.\r\n\nAlso, can actively growing nerves merge or graft to other nerves they touch? Does it form collagen scaffolding between the separated parts like cut muscle, or can it connect in some other way?",

            "comment": "Schwann cells are the cells that are responsible for supporting your nerves in the peripheral nervous system. They're best known for insulating nerves by wrapping them in myelin, a combination of proteins and lipids; however, some Schwann cells just provide support and do not insulate nerves. These are called non-myelinating Schwann cells or Remak Schwann cells (named after the guy who discovered them). These are the cells that overgrow in Neurofibromatosis and form the tumors you can see on the skin. Since these cells normally support the nerves by secreting a variety of factors, when they overgrow they secrete even more of these factors which cause the surrounding cells to also proliferate including skin cells, blood vessel cells, immune cells etc. As these tumors grow, nerve endings will also tend to grow with them like in regular skin. \n\nGrowing nerves will generally not merge into each other. Different nerves detect different signals (eg light touch, pressure, pain, temperature, etc) so merging nerves would eliminate our ability to discriminate between different stimuli. However, we have been able to graft damaged nerves together. This is one way people are looking to help people with spinal cord injuries regain feeling and control over their limbs. \n\nNeurofibromatosis - https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/fulltext/S1535-6108(08)00005-6\n\nNerve grafts - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-011-0024-6",

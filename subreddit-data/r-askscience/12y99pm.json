This does mean that we\u2019re currently in an ice age. There have also been many ice ages throughout the history of earth, including a time called the \u201csnowball earth\u201d when there were no oceans, just glaciers. \nHowever, to refer to the period that you\u2019re likely thinking of, when mammoths and giant ground sloths and saber tooth tigers walked the earth, scientists use the term \u201clast glacial maximum\u201d.\nAs you can see from [this visualization](https://i.redd.it/i731448edv071.png) there were more or less the same oceans we have now, except at the poles.\nHope this helps!",

Unfortunately for this idea, because cycles are predictable and regular, we know that we actually should be entering a period of global cooling, so it seems like we are indeed responsible for the global temperature rise. In fact if we weren\u2019t in the point in the cycle we are in, we likely would be seeing far more catastrophic results from climate change already.",

The approximate time of deglaciation (i.e., what we'd consider to be the transition to from glacial to interglacial conditions) occurred ~14 kyr ago. So, if you were assuming a cyclic process with a single period, it wouldn't be unreasonable to think that we should be heading back into a glacial period soon. The tricky bit is that (ignoring anthropogenic influence), while glacial-interglacial shifts are definitely cyclic, they're pretty complicated patterns that do not tend to have truly constant periods between glacial and interglacial conditions. This is because they reflect superposition of [several periodic inputs with different periods and non-constant amplitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles#/media/File:MilankovitchCyclesOrbitandCores.png).",

This is in contrast to \"greenhouse\" states (i.e. [icehouse vs greenhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_and_icehouse_Earth)). Within an icehouse state, there will be glacial-interglacial cycles where the extent of polar (and mountain glacier, etc) ice expands and contracts, respectively. Glacial-interglacial cycles and transitions from icehouse to greenhouse (and vice versa) do imply differences in average global temperatures, but being in an icehouse state simply means that average global temperatures are such that temperatures at the poles are sufficient to allow persistent ice sheets.",

The former changes are less periodic and occur on 10^(6) to 10^(8) year timescales. The latter changes are closer to truly periodic (though not strictly with a single period as they reflect superposition of a variety of orbital cycles - e.g., obliquity, eccentricity, etc. - with different periods and relative amplitudes)and occur on 10^(5) to 10^(3) year timescales.",

With the tectonic/geodynamic changes that cause the state shifts from greenhouse to icehouse or icehouse to greenhouse, these typically occur at geologic rates, i.e., *very* slow on even millennial timescales, let alone human timescales. So along with there being no demonstrable evidence that the rapid rise in greenhouse gases, increase in global atmospheric temperature, increase in average sea surface temperatures, ocean acidification, etc., are linked to natural phenomena (and this has been discussed, at length, and demonstrated effectively for decades), the rates of these changes are not what we'd expect (i.e., they're way to fast by several orders of magnitude) from changes in deep carbon cycling from something like increased rates of sea floor spreading.",

Apparently even the \"snowball earth\" had some oceans around the equator. https://www.science.org/content/article/life-may-have-survived-far-north-equator-during-snowball-earth",

            "comment": "We are in an ice age now. Any period of geologic time where there is ice at the poles is an ice age.\n\nEarth has undergone multiple ice ages, or glaciations, each of which consists of multiple pulses of cold climate and glacial advance known as glacial periods. Periods where glaciers are receding / in decline are known as interglacial periods. We are currently living in an interglacial period of what is known as the Quaternary Glaciation.\n\nSo, yes, there is liquid water during an ice age. Even during the hypothesized Snowball Earth there was liquid water beneath the ice. If all water on and in Earth were to freeze, life would be eradicated, as life depends on liquid water.",

Temperature is kinda of the average of velocities of gas molecules, but individual gas molecules can have higher or lower velocities. So when a heavier molecules like co2 bumps into something light like hydrogen and transfers all of its force, the hydrogen would move very fast and can reach escape velocity. the lighter the molecules, the easier it is for them to reach that velocity.",

            "comment": "The answer is yes, but there is *a lot* of nuance and a fair bit of semantics buried in there, especially with respect to when you want to start calling Earth, *Earth*. If we start from the formation of the solar system and consider the entire history of the planet, by the very nature of [planetary accretion and formation processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formation_and_evolution_of_the_Solar_System#Formation_of_the_planets), in the earliest history of what would eventually be Earth it was definitely increasing in size through accretion and conglomeration of smaller bits. However, from a semantic standpoint, it's a bit tricky to say is this actually Earth? If we move forward in time a bit (but not that far) to the moon forming impact, it's generally considered that the proto-Earth (i.e., Earth before it got hit by Theia) was probably ~90% of the mass (the exact proportion varies, but for our purposes it really only matters that most consider that proto-Earth was smaller than Earth) of what we think of as Earth (e.g., [O'Neill, 1991](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0016703791901696)), so, especially if we're considering size in terms of mass and not volume/radius, then unquestionably the Earth \"grew\" after the impact with Theia. But this gets into semantics again, i.e., there's a reason the literature usually calls Earth before the moon forming impact the \"proto-Earth\", i.e., it wasn't really Earth in the sense that we think of it. If you want a deeper dive on the moon forming impact and this question, there are a few threads here on it (e.g., [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/qdbx6r/did_theia_actually_smash_into_the_earth_or_is)).Now, if we instead consider the bulk of Earth history and when Earth was for sure *Earth* in a traditional sense, the answer gets a bit more murky. For sure, Earth's mass is [not constant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_mass#Variation), there are losses through atmospheric escape and additions through deposition of dust and occasional large impators (among other details), but broadly these are relatively small variations on the scale of the entire planet. If we instead focus less on mass and instead turn our attention to volume and radius, this is where things go off the rails a bit.Before plate tectonics was accepted (or really even thought of), there were a variety of ideas centered on the idea of major changes in Earth's volume/radius to explain features that we now relate to plate tectonics (e.g., mountain ranges, etc). There was definitely a period of time where the idea of an *expanding Earth*, i.e., a persistent increase in the radius of the planet, was proposed (this is touched on a bit in an old [thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1lrref/does_the_expanding_earth_hypothesis_have_any_merit/)). If you go into older literature even as recently as the 1980s you can find some discussions of either potential mechanisms or evidence for expansion of Earth (e.g., [Cox &amp; Doell, 1961](https://www.nature.com/articles/189045a0), [Birch, 1968](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0031920168900010), [Canuto, 1981](https://www.nature.com/articles/290739a0)). That being said, broadly, the idea of an expanding Earth largely transitioned from a sort of reasonable but always problematic hypothesis to explain observations based on what we knew at the time to a collection of mostly pseudoscientific proposals pretty firmly drifting into conspiracy theory (e.g., [Sudiro, 2014](https://hgss.copernicus.org/articles/5/135/2014/)). That would seem to be the end of it, but there's one more weird bit of literature to consider.With the advent and proliferation of very high resolution geodetic techniques (e.g., GPS), it's become possible to very precisely measure the radius/volume of the Earth and look for changes in these properties. Depending on how you process this data, you can find what appears to be an indication that the radius of the Earth is currently increasing at a rate of ~0.2 mm/yr (e.g., [Shen et al., 2011](https://www.annalsofgeophysics.eu/index.php/annals/article/view/4951), [Shen et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674984715000518)). The trick is that if you go through the analysis and look at the uncertainties (which are not faithfully reported in the abstracts mind you) you'll find that the uncertainties on these measurements tend to be larger than the measurements, i.e., despite what is stated in their abstracts, the final conclusion from the most recent set of these papers puts the rate of expansion at 0.35 +/- 0.47 mm/yr. That basically means that these rates are also indistinguishable from zero change in the radius (or even a slight decrease in radius). Also of relevance is that different groups have used the same data to argue that the radius is not changing (e.g., [Wu et al., 2011](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011GL047450)) (and more broadly, those Shen papers are *weird* to say the least, e.g., [this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ftsyq7/is_there_zero_merit_to_the_idea_of_an_expanding)). Despite the somewhat dubious nature of the claim, there has been some discussion of viable mechanisms for explaining an apparent expansion, *if* it was real. Most of these focus on an imbalance between the mass of material subducted vs the mass of material reaching the surface in plumes and related changes in density in these materials that could in turn change total volume and radius (e.g., [Edwards, 2016](https://hgss.copernicus.org/articles/7/125/2016/), [Edwards, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674984718301678#bib2)). It's not clear how this mechanism could actually function in a long term sense, i.e., you can't invoke this to explain *persistent* expansion, so the best you could do is say that as the balance between subduction vs plume upwellings changes, you might expect small amounts of expansion and contraction. I.e., conservation of mass is a cruel mistress.\n\n**TL;DR** - Without a doubt, the size of what would eventually become Earth changed in the earliest history of the planet as it grew through accretion and with a big jump in mass with the moon forming impact. Since then, broadly there have been relatively small mass fluctuations from atmospheric escape and impacts/dust deposition. There is kind of a fringe argument that the radius of the planet might be slowly increasing (and an older, effectively pseudoscientific argument about a large-scale persistent *expanding Earth*), but the data supporting this is pretty sketchy at best and the invoked mechanisms are problematic.",

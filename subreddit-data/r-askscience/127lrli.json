    "postText": " The way I understand the causes for the Flynn effect are as follows:\n\n1. Malnutrition and illness can stunt the IQ of a growing child. These have been on the decline in most of the world for the last century.\n2. Education raises IQ. Public education is more ubiquitous than ever, hence the higher IQs today.\n3. Reduction in use of harmful substances such as lead pipes.\n\nHas this effect petered out in the developed world, or is it still going strong? Is it really an increase in everyone's IQ's or are there just less malnourished, illiterate people in the world (in other words are the rich today smarter than the rich of yesterday)?",

At least in some places. Studies from several western countries have demonstrated the \"reverse Flynn effect\" which has begun sometime in the 1990s. More recently, it was also confirmed that the cause seems to be primarily [environmental factors](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1718793115) instead of migration or other social changes, which were brought up as possible explanation. However, it is still not clear what exactly those factors really are. What *is* clear however, is that while basic nutrition and formal education have certainly plateaued in western society, pollution is actually on the rise. It's not as bad as it was with leaded gasoline in the 70s, but low air quality definitely impacts the brain (and every other organ) negatively, even at limits that were officially deemed safe. [See here for more info](https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692\\(18\\)32723-5/fulltext). Particularly fine dust (PM 2.5 and below - mostly stemming from Diesel engines) has been shown to cross the blood brain barrier and prolonged exposure directly correlates with Alzheimer incidences as well as other neurodegenerative diseases ([see here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34561961/)). This issue will also continue until we finally get all combustion engine cars out of cities.",

By 'environmental factors' they mean: \"changes in educational exposure or quality, changing media exposure, worsening nutrition or health, and social spillovers from increased immigration.\" And these are all total hypotheses, to be clear.\n\nPM2.5 has gotten mostly better since 1990, not worse, so that wouldn't make much sense as the explanation anyay.\n\n(But all that aside, air pollution is still incredibly serious and we should still get combustion engine cars out of cities.)",

It is helpful to think about the difference, but on some level we do it more for the benefit of regulation and law than science. For example, water is regulated quite differently if it is groundwater vs surface water. They are both water and they are extremely connected. Some pollution is called point source (gas stations) and others are called non-point source (like nitrate from farms or cattle feed lots) but they both spread in similar ways.\n\nIndoor and outdoor air are regulated differently because of the amount of time you spend in each space. But of you love next to a freeway, like I do, I would be concerned about both of them.\n\nTo answer your question, micro plastics are everywhere.

Don\u2019t go cheap, and make sure you look at the recommended size then upsize, but it can work very well\n\nBatteries are the most expensive part but are generally interchangeable across a product line, so you don\u2019t have to buy as many. I now have: lawn mower, string trimmer, blower, hedge trimmer, and snow blower but fewer batteries.  The only issue is the blower goes through batteries quickly \n\nAnd you don\u2019t just save on gas: no oil, no spark plugs, no annual maintenance!

Broadly speaking, it states that microplastics bioaccumulate, and reproductive health deteriorates with age. (They also take a weird detour to mention that THC harms male reproduction, which I found odd.) Which is fine, it\u2019s good to sort of catalogue all these things in one place. \n\nTheir main evidence for harm is a study on mice, where mice were given exclusively water that had very high levels of polystyrene microplastics. Not unrealistically high if we\u2019re talking about acute exposure, but a bit excessive if the goal is to simulate chronic environmental exposure. They talk a lot about bio accumulation of micro-plastics but they didn\u2019t demonstrate if the levels they detected in tissues was constant after the first day, or if it increased over time. They also didn\u2019t test to see if bioaccumulation decreases if mice are given pure water after a period of exposure. \n\nThese things don\u2019t take away from the actual purpose of their research, which is to look at the biochemical mechanism by which microplastics affect male reproduction, but they make it hard to reasonably extrapolate the findings to a macroscopic public health level. \n\nYou\u2019ll find similar experimental setups (continuous, high levels of exposure) in most of the studies reviewed in the 23rd source of that paper. In that review, they mention that they\u2019ve only included papers which show significant effects of micro plastic ingestion. That\u2019s because these studies aren\u2019t meant to show that the current environmental levels of microplastics pose a harm to wildlife or humans, they\u2019re meant to be mechanistic studies to evaluate *potential* ways in which microplastics cause harm. \n\nMy point isn\u2019t that microplastics are definitely harmless, in fact I think that we\u2019ll probably find some sort of definitive evidence linking them to *something* eventually. But the evidence we currently have is so tenuous that it\u2019s impossible to say with any degree of certainty that they are responsible for *anything*. \n\nI\u2019d say they\u2019re currently at the same level as the random chemicals which are affected by Prop 65 warnings in California. That is, we know that they have the *potential* to cause harm, but as far as we can tell, the risk associated with normal human environmental exposure is virtually nothing.",

If the company doesn't like your results then they ban you from publishing, its in the contract. CocaCola for instance has done this. \n\nWhile that doesn't stop someone who was able to get the money for the research a different way, companies do have direct influence over what gets published. It could be that right now there is no money to research microplastics, so what little work that has been done its not enough.

Meaning, you take a concept and can apply it to different situations. This has likely increased because our society has changed from labor where the focus may have been on a few repetitive tasks, to jobs, education and real world experience requiring more and more abstract reasoning. We may be reaching the plateau of abstract reasoning, either due to ability, or because the need for this hasn\u2019t continued to grow at such a rate. There may be other abilities that will be more valuable but that IQ tests don\u2019t currently sufficiently test for.",

Take some black kids eventually adopted by white parents. Observe that their IQ scores go up. But also observe that their scores are still below white kids. The supporters of the genetic difference hypothesis conclude this proves IQ is mostly genetic. Supporters of the environmental hypothesis conclude this proves IQ is mostly environmental. Actual scientists conclude these kinds of studies can't actually control for the environmental factor, because of course there's more to a black kid's environment than the color of their adoptive parents.\n\nConfounding this problem is\n\n1. Historically, whenever a study shows an IQ test to support an environmental hypothesis, the response is to consider the IQ test flawed and come up with a new IQ test. This process repeats until the IQ test supports the genetic difference hypothesis, at which point the IQ test is deemed correctly made.\n2. [IQ shows the most utility on the low end of the spectrum and the least utility on the high end of the spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)#Spearman's_law_of_diminishing_returns). An IQ test is very useful for separating developmentally disabled children from developmentally healthy children. An IQ test is not useful for identifying which children will grow up to be \"the most intelligent\" in real life, because intelligence in real life is not a scalar value. On the contrary, [cognitive diversity is more effective in creative problem solving domain](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1046496415602558?journalCode=sgrd)s, distorting the framing of the question itself.\n3. We can scientifically demonstrate bias towards underestimating the impact of environmental factors. For example, [Robert Rosenthal demonstrated that rats will score objectively better or worse on IQ tests simply by being randomly labeled \"smart\" or \"dumb\" before the test is conducted](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bs.3830080302). Eliminating environmental factors in intelligence testing becomes increasingly impossible (without eliminating all utility of the test) leading scientists to hesitancy of drawing any concrete conclusion.",

It's been used by literal white supremacists to claim black people are inherently less than and literally designed to be manual workers in long discredited books like \"the bell curve\"...But if we ignore those problems...\n\nIntelligence doesn't have a whole lot to do with genetics outside of severe genetic disorders. Yes, some twin studies indicate there is a possibility of some genetic indication. \n\nNearly all intelligence is due to environment and the reason it *seems* genetic is because wealth tends to be generational.\n\nEdit: it's kind of appalling how's many people out so much stock in genetic intelligence. It's a deeply racist notion that has been the foundation of modern white supremacy. \"The bell curve\" has been widely debunked as garbage science.",

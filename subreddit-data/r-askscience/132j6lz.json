In time (within 120 days), I know my RBCs will die in the receiving patient, replaced by their own bone marrow generated RBCs. But my wife had an interesting question:\n\n\u201cWill any part of you remain in the baby (patient) forever?\u201d\n\nI think she was referring to literally anything on the microbiological level. Would my blood donation to an infant ever leave an imprint, even if incredibly insignificant?",

            "comment": "\"Studies have shown that donor DNA in blood transfusion recipients persists for a number of days, sometimes longer, but its presence is unlikely to alter genetic tests significantly. Red blood cells, the primary component in transfusions, have no nucleus and no DNA. Transfused blood does, however, host a significant amount of DNA-containing white blood cells, or leukocytes\u2014around a billion cells per unit (roughly one pint) of blood. Even blood components that have been filtered to remove donor white cells can have millions of leukocytes per unit.\"\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/donor-blood-transfustion/\n\n\"change your DNA?\u00a0No, receiving a donation does not alter the patient's DNA. Interestingly, though, in most people, it is possible to detect a very small amount of the donor's DNA in the recipient's blood for a few days after the transfusion.\"\n\nhttps://stanfordbloodcenter.org/most-commonly-googled-questions-about-blood-donation-answered-by-the-experts-part-5",

    "postText": "I am professor Ilan Marek, (https://ilanmarek.technion.ac.il), one of the best synthetic organic chemists in the world today. I have received accolades every single year from different organizations and different countries (the last one being the Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award from the American Chemical Society, prize which is not frequently awarded to non-American citizens), and have been elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 2017 and to the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities in 2019. I am an editorial board member of a long list of important journals in organic chemistry from different countries and societies. I have educated 44 MSc and PhD students and 43 post-doctoral fellows in my career, 26 are now faculty members in different countries and the rest are occupying important positions in various chemical or pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe world population is rapidly expanding.\u00a02.5 new inhabitants\u00a0(on average) are born\u00a0every second.\u00a0By 2050, our planet is going to be\u00a0inhabited by 10+ billion people.\u00a0To\u00a0maintain and improve the global quality of life while meeting the needs of an expanding world population, the production of food, medicine,\u00a0consumer,\u00a0and new technology\u00a0products must be increased to meet this growing demand.\u00a0Can the world sustain its growing population\u00a0in the same way we did up to now,\u00a0without causing additional ecological damage and further depleting natural resources?\n\nTo give just one example of the increasing environmental impact of modern life, in the last 70 years, the production of plastic increased from 1.5 million tons per year in 1950 to 450 million tons per year in 2022. That would be fine if one knew how to handle plastics after usage. Unfortunately, that is not the case. Only 9% of plastic is recycled. In 2020 alone, more than 20 million tons of plastics ended up in the sea, creating a floating mass twice the size of Texas in the Pacific Ocean. If we keep on like this, by 2050 there will be more plastic in the sea than fish. If that's not enough, recent studies found micro particles of plastic in people's blood and lungs.\n\nWe are in a situation where drastic changes are needed. To support the needs of the growing population, to maintain and improve the life expectancy and life quality we're taking for granted, we cannot just produce more. We need to produce better.\n\nThe answer, I believe, lies in catalysis.\n\nA catalyst is any substance that triggers or speeds up a chemical reaction. Catalysts are crucial for life itself: they control our cells, perform our digestion, form part of our immune systems. Catalysts also make modern life possible: they play key roles in food production, drug and materials manufacturing, energy production and many other fields. It is hard to imagine the world today, or indeed civilized society in general, without the impact of catalysis on all fundamental aspects required for life.\n\nCatalysis stands at the nexus of many disciplines, enabling discoveries that impact areas as diverse as health (e.g., medicine, imaging), food (agrichemicals), energy (efficiency, storage, sustainable manufacturing) and more, and as such, forms an important part of the global economy. It is generally associated with underpinning approximately 30% of global GDP, representing roughly 3 trillion USD, and is involved at some point in the processing of 90% of all manufactured products.\n\nTo answer these crucial problems, The Technion has created the Resnick Sustainability Center for\nCatalysis - the first of its kind in Israel and one of only a handful of similar projects\nworldwide - embodies a compelling vision: Innovation in catalysis is key to solving many of the great challenges facing us today. The goal of the Center is to discover and develop new catalysts touching many different fields. This will be achieved by harnessing the Technion's stellar resources in chemistry, biotechnology, physics, biology, computer science, chemical engineering, materials engineering and food engineering - all within a single facility. The Center will serve as an incubator for talent, ideas and solutions, not only strengthening the Technion's reputation as a world leader in this area but also potentially ensuring that the Israeli economy benefits from the improved industrial processes and a lucrative set of exportable technologies that will result from their implementation.\n\nIn contrast to the traditional laboratory setup - in which researchers work in isolation from each other - The Resnick Sustainability Center for Catalysis will feature an innovative open space research laboratory model, providing lab space for new faculty members and their teams. There are several reasons for this approach: to enhance multidisciplinary collaboration in a field that is evolving ever more rapidly, to pool the use of advanced pieces of equipment among multiple researchers, and to encourage researchers from two or more academic disciplines to combine their expertise to solve major problems in the field. The Technion believes that the pace of innovation and discovery made possible by this open-space laboratory setup is likely to exceed the pace expected from a conventional lab arrangement.\n\nI will be here to answer your questions at **9am PT (12 PM ET, 16 UT)**, ask me anything!\n\nUsername: /u/israelinsf",

Ideally, one could make the same type of products with CO2 (source of carbon), water and the sun (Energy). However, it looks more like science fiction but should be a goal. We need to fix goals that are yet unattainable to be sure we are changing paradigms! So, to have a different source of feedstock to produce 400 millions tons of plastic every year\u2026. I doubt that we will see it in the next few decades. \r  \nFor the filtration aspect, that is an excellent idea but I am not aware of any catalyst that is able to do it. A catalyst is a component that helps a chemical reaction to proceed at lower energy, faster rate. To make your proposal valid, we need to find a catalyst that would be stable to oxidation, to water etc\u2026. This catalyst should then react with these microparticules and react with something else to produce a benign product. Pretty complex! The only solution I see now would be to use microorganism that could digest these microparticules but how to keep them alive in such drastic conditions.\r  \nAs for the cement, currently no but we absolutely need to find one.",

I have so many questions, but I'll keep it to just two for now. Thank you for taking the time.\n\n1) We've had many discussions around the plastics issue. In our opinion, plastics for consumables (bottles, food packaging, etc) are a significant problem. Is there a method to produce a plastic (or similar material) that achieves much of the goals of food packaging (sterile, durable, waterproof, see-through) that can also decompose or otherwise be readily broken down/recycled after use? What would it take to implement this material and displace current plastic use in consumables?\n\n2) As a technology startup, we stand on the shoulders of academic research. However, we believe that targeted commercial research can be faster and more readily acquire funding (via venture capital) compared with academic research. Thoughts on this? Sitting at the crossroads of academic research vs commercial research is the question of who owns the intellectual property. How does the Resnick Sustainability Center tackle this issue?",

As for the first question: I am not aware of it but the real point is not only to develop new types of polymers but rather to understand how to break C-C bond efficiently to reach back the monomer. Up to now, we are very good at creating C-C bonds but pretty bad at breaking them!\r  \nAs for the second question, we need to find a decent (creative!) solution and agreement that will satisfy both the University and the startup. The issue of IP is complex and one needs to think deeper and change his policy for the benefit of all. We are working on it!",

I would avoid judging the impact of the current research but if life expectancy increased of 15 years in the last 50 years, clearly catalysis had a major role in it under very different aspects. I can easily predict that the next change of paradigms will be the use of machine learning in the design of new catalyst and catalytic processes.",

For one do you believe this theory to have any merit? Secondly, assuming this theory has any merit what would the impact on global trade be during an ice age caused after massive droughts and huge amounts of sea levels being risen? How would the ports and infrastructure be able to handle it and what can humans do to mitigate the damages?",

These are gigantesque structures using special chemical elements. One should think ahead and be sure that all solutions will be truly sustainable.

I am afraid that this solution will bring problems to the future generations and I would prefer not to create additional problems. It would require careful monitoring, regulations and adherence to sustainability practices. I would prefer to avoid adding an additional problem to our children and grand-children and rather find proper scientific solutions.

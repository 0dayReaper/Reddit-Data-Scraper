            "comment": "&gt; Don\u2019t these presuppose a perfect globe\n\nNo, they do not. For horizontal coordinates, modern coordinate systems approximate the shape of the Earth as an [oblate spheroid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spheroid), which we refer to as a [reference ellipsoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_ellipsoid#Reference_ellipsoid). A given reference ellipsoid can be defined with a length of the semi-major axis (i.e., the equatorial radius), the semi-minor axis (i.e., the polar radius), and the flattening, though in practice you only need two of these quantities to define the ellipsoid shape and the most common to report are the semi-major axis and the flattening (or its inverse).\n\n&gt; how do they deal with the major irregularities in the shape of Earth?\n\nLet's consider a [geographic coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_coordinate_system) (as opposed to a [projected coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projected_coordinate_system)), and specifically [WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System#WGS_84), which is the most recent version of the \"World Geodetic System\" and one of the more common sets of geographic coordinate systems you'd be likely to encounter. WGS84 is one version of a [geodetic datum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum), basically the shape of the oblate spheroid that is used to approximate the shape of the Earth. Chances are if coordinates are reported in latitude and longitude, these are given in WGS84, though not always, for example if you're using a topographic map in the US, it might be in NAD83 (a different geodetic datum)  though these two should give relatively similar coordinates, but other geodetic datums can be quite different depending on the values they use for the properties of the ellipsoid, i.e., semi-major axis, flattening. The differences in these parameters can reflect more accurate measurements of the shape of the Earth (e.g., the differences between WGS84 and the earlier versions like WGS60, etc), or if we are considering a \"local datum\", it may use a semi-major axis and flattening that better approximates the shape of the Earth for the region for which the datum is defined, but is worse if you were to use it for the entire planet.\n\nThus, while we think of latitude and longitude as angular measurements on the surface of a sphere (e.g., [this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#/media/File:Latitude_and_longitude_graticule_on_a_sphere.svg)), in reality (at least for modern uses of these), they are angular measurements on the surface of an ellipsoid / oblate spheroid. This is why the meridian distance (in km, but you could do it miles, etc) between degrees of latitude actually change as a function of latitude (e.g., the [table and/or formula for WGS84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latitude#Meridian_distance_on_the_ellipsoid) here). If we approximated the Earth as sphere for these coordinates (as we did before we had accurate measurements of the \"figure of the Earth\"), the meridian distance for latitude would be constant (but it would still change for longitude, going from a maximum at the equator to zero at the poles). \n\nFinally, all of the above has been concerned with the horizontal datum (i.e., latitude and longitude), but to uniquely define a coordinate, we also need to consider the vertical position, and thus the vertical datum that is used. Here, most modern coordinate systems do not use the ellipsoid to reference the elevation of a point, but instead use the vertical position relative to the [geoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid), i.e., what the surface of a global ocean would be accounting for mass differences and rotation, but ignoring winds, currents, and tides, etc. In some very specific circumstances, an ellipsoidal vertical datum might be used (i.e., referencing elevations with respect to the surface of the ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth), but generally, if you are given a latitude, longitude, and elevation for a point, the latitude and longitude will be with reference to a specific ellipsoid (i.e., the horizontal datum) and the elevation will be with reference to a specific geoid (i.e., the vertical datum).",

                            "comment": "In addition to the great answer above, and beyond the question you asked, there is continental drift to consider... Fun :-)\n\nContinents move and in order to keep Lat/Long somewhat constant, the reference model changes over time, But the lat/long of say the mailbox of your home still changes a bit over time, because every place on Earth moves at different speed in different directions.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd it gets more fun. There is more than one reference model (as the answer above hints at)\n\nWGS84 is trying to keep lat/long changes over time minimal on average across the world. That is awesome for G(lobal)PS\n\nHowever, you could imagine a reference frame that minimizes for example changes in the US to be useful for American purposes. If you live in America you would prefer something that moves with the American continent (as a whole) and minimizes Lat/Long changes in the US. You don't worry if the lat/long of the Eiffel tower changes a lot. NAD83 gives you that reference frame. Many countries have their own systems.\n\nSo if you get lat/long from a US map that is in NAD83, it can be a meter or more away from what GPS tells you. This is something you need to consider e.g. if you import recent NAD83 based data into a high definition map system for driving a car.\n\nSwitzerland (until 1995) declared the world a Bessel ellipsoid from 1841, use a Mercator projection, and centered their coordinates in the old observatory in the capital of Bern. Because the world is now (Mercator) flat, they don't need lat/long, but can use cartesian coordinates (x,y). They didn't want negative numbers, so the \"origin\" in Bern is at (600km/400km) with East/West before North/South, i.e. putting the origin in France :-) It also makes sure that the E/W coordinate is always bigger than the N/W, so they cannot really be confused. Brilliant, and sufficient for a small country. In 1995 they moved to something WGS84 based. To make sure there is no confusion between old and new, they added 2000km and 1000km to E/W and N/S respectively. Took some 20 years to switch over.\n\nSwitzerland is landlocked, so doesn't have \"sea\" access for their own \"sea level\" So for height, they use a [tide gauge in Marseille](https://www.boatsnews.com/story/34507/discovering-the-tide-gauge-of-marseille), France, instead of a globally optimized geoid like WGS84.\n\nBasically there are hundreds of reference frames and they all change over time and the technology that gave us GPS also gave us computers to compute back and forth between them all as needed. We just have to remember to do that.",

For example, the US uses a state plane coordinate system to make local maps in the states.  They similarly use xy coordinates fitted to the specific locality, although some states use lambert conformal maps rather than mercator.  \n\nFor small areas, you can minimize distortion on your maps by fitting them specifically to your specific area.",

This translates to about 6 feet per century. I know there are some tectonic plates that move significantly faster, but the change over time is still minor. It would take several centuries for even 1 longitudinal second of change. This isn't to say these changes shouldn't be tracked.

After all the terror attacks around the world, many countries passed laws restricting the accuracy of GPS devices to help curb the severity of the damage (if your goal is to bring down a building being off even a foot can lead to failure of that plan). Since many of these countries are some of highest consumer markets for technology the companies put in limiters in both the hardware and software of the devices to minimize accuracy. 10-15 meters off is actually the most accurate you will ever get. We, the consumer, just don't notice it because when using it for navigation being that far off is unnoticeable, but precision is the key then that variance leads to a catastrophic failure.",

            "comment": "First to understand how navigation tools it's good to know how the earth is modeled. We use many different approaches to model the earth from an ellipsoid to transform it a 2D plane. The model of the earth starts with an ellipsoid (some more oblong than others) and then gets translated to a 2D Cartesian plane. \n\nFor 2D projection, some models wrap a cone around (conical) the earth and project onto the cone before flattening, others wrap a cylinder (cylindrical), others do more fancier shapes. Each approach to transformation has places or areas of greater accuracy in terms of distances than others, with less relevant areas distorted. \n\nOne you get that, then you can understand how navigation tools pinpoint a location.\n\n- Navigational tools pinpoint where the user is with respect to at least four sattelites that orbit as a constellation (total 24). \n\n\n- GPS transceivers \"trilaterate\" the current users location based on simultaneous receipt of 4 or more satellite broadcasts. Signals travel at the speed of light, and the signal contains the unique identifier of the sattelite along with its internal atomic clock time.\n\n\n- The simultaneous signal recepit of the satellites during the time of signal broadcast accounts for time relativity involved, as a satellite is positioned father from the earth's surface and therefore is in a different space and time than the receiver on the ground. The time broadcasted by the sattelite is already tuned to account for the differences here.\n\n\n- Since each sattelites current location is known for any given broadcast time (typically in a earth centric coordinate system) the time differences between signals received simultaneously is then used to determine the current position with respect to a geodedic coordinate system, then transformed into a projected map location. \n\nThis is why sometimes GPS signals can be skewed in downtown areas. The signal broadcast coming from the satellites can be interrupted by tall buildings leading to fewer satelites available, or signals may bounce off adding time to the signal receipt and leading to inaccurate measurements.\n\n[Edit] as movieguy pointed out, there are precision irregularities that are negligible. The choice of ellipsoid does assume a oblong earth shape, not a perfect sphere. There are tradeoffs, but when mean sea level estimates are taken into account those variations be accounted for. The following article explains more about it. \n\nhttps://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0703/geoid1of3.html",

And it turns out these are very small. \n\nThe flattening which causes earth to be called an oblate spheroid is very minor. The circumference difference between the equator and the poles is only 41 miles. One place I looked described it as 1 part in 300. \n\nWhile the Earth's surface may seem rough, the variation of the surface is so minor that the planet would be smoother than a cue ball if shrunk down to the same size. The difference between the deepest point in the ocean and the highest peak is only 12.5 miles. \n\nThere is some variation in sea level around the globe due to a variety of factors.

Mars with its thinner atmosphere and lower gravity has allowed the variation to range from -10km to +10km from the global mean radius of 3369km. Mars is gritty! \n\nhttps://mars.nasa.gov/mgs/sci/mola/dec10-99rel/global_paper.html",

            "comment": "They pretty much didn't.  Until the modern era, navigation was something of a guess.   You headed off in the right general direction based on the compass and the captain and navigator's job was to finetune that guess as you went along using navigation aids such as the stars and known landmarks, as well as tools like the sextant and compass, to correct your aim on the move.\n\nThe captain might carry the course in his head but he'd also use his tools to ensure he was on course, and the mastery of those tools was half the reason for the captain's existence and was often a carefully guarded secret, especially for the early Portuguese and Dutch navigators who could sell their services for a small fortune in the early days of deep sea sailing.\n\nAnd that, of course, presupposes that you have such tools.  The Vikings didn't.  They basically threw themselves into the sea aiming for a particular landmass and praying to whichever of the gods rulled over navigation to wind up in the right general area, then crept up and down the coast until they found their specific destination -- if they ever did.  Greenland was discovered by a Viking aiming for Iceland and missing completely..\n\nThere were plenty of examples of poor navigators getting way off track.  When Marquis de Lafayette first came to the New World his ship, which was shooting for New York, wound up I believe off the coast of South Carolina.  Someone made a bad guess and didn't know the stars as well as they thought they did. These things just happened, pretty much right up until the invention of the wireless radio.\n\nThe discovery of the magnetic North Pole helped a lot too of course, but it wasn't really until the wireless stations allowed a ship to correct its trajectory based on the position of other ships and landmasses from hundreds of miles away that we began to really master navigation of the sea.\n\nWith wireless we could begin to triangulate the exact position of a ship and give it several other sets of eyes to make sure its captain is not asleep at the switch and keep it going along established sea lanes.  That allowed sea lanes to be way more predictable, and basically shaped modern deep sea navigation as it is today.\n\nBTW  it's the fact that the Titanic sinking happened in the dawn of this era that made it so poignant, because other people could warn Titanic about the berg, because of *Californian* so closeby but with no night watch on their radio, because of *Carpathian* steaming hopessly at its best possible speed towards the stricken ship despite no hope of getting there before it's too late but still being in time to save hundreds of passengers in the boats, and because people could talk to Titanic right up until the moment the power failed which they'd never really been able to do with a deep sea wreck before.",

            "comment": "Others gave good answers but I need to point out that GPS gives you a 3D position in the world (along with the current time). As such it doesn\u2019t care about the Earth\u2019s shape and this is why satellites and missiles all use GPS just fine. It\u2019s the GPS mapping software that maps 3D position to a map that needs to take the irregularities into account.",

We all know any 3D program you can just plop down a sphere in seconds, what math does Google use to create their projection of the \"oblate spheroid\" and how was the topographical data even sampled and interpreted.",

Depending on what part of the world you\u2019re in, a second is only accurate to about 80-100 feet. For precision purposes, you will need to work with decimal degrees of a second. Something like 42 15 07.123, for example.",

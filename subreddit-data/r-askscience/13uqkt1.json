            "comment": "As far as size goes it's a little more complicated than molecule vs molecule. Essentially the salt must be in solution for your situation. Salt will dissolve into the water as ions, which in turn attract water molecules since they are slightly polar. \n\nThis is known as the hydration sphere for the water solvent in this case, or solvation shell more generally. The hydration sphere comprising the ion plus a number of water molecules will be larger than a single water molecule to answer your question.",

            "comment": "Since you indicated reverse-osmosis, I'm assuming you're interested in how semi-permeable membranes work for water desalination/purification.\n\nSimply put, reverse-osmosis works by artificially controlling the concentration gradient. A semi-permeable membrane will certain molecules through a channel but block other molecules from passing through. Imagine a tank of water separated by a barrier (the semi-permeable membrane). On the left-hand side, you have your untreated water. On the right-hand side, you have your treated water. By applying pressure selectively on the left-hand side, you can push the water molecules through the barrier as the individual molecules can pass through the semi-permeable membrane's channel while the salt ions remain trapped as they cannot pass through due to their size (hence why the membrane is semi-permeable, as it is selective). Salt ions dissolved in water have something called a hydration sphere, which is what happens when the ion (the solute) draws water molecules (the solvent) around it due to electrostatic charge. The number of water molecules drawn to surround the molecule of solute is called the hydration number. As the ion is surrounded by water molecules, it becomes too large to pass through the channels of the semi-permeable membrane (but water molecules can pass through just fine). As a result, this results in a saltier water concentrate on the left-hand side of the barrier (brine) and pure water on the right-hand side.",

The individual celeb might be a diminutive figure but with the entire entourage they're huge",

                            "comment": "Biological ion channels use the same phenomenon to selectively allow large salt ions through but not small ones.\n\nSodium is smaller than potassium, so sodium channels exclude potassium by being only narrow enough for sodium to fit through. But how do potassium channels exclude sodium? They have two constrictions: first a wider one, then a more narrow one. The wider one is the perfect size to strip the hydration sphere off a potassium ion, while the hydration sphere of smaller sodium ions is unaffected on account of not coming into close contact with the edges. The dehyrated potassium can then pass through the second, smaller constriction, while the still-hydrated sodium ion cannot.",

Most common anions, however, are larger than water (Cl-, Br-, HCO3-, CO3(2-), HSO4-; F-, OH-, and H3O+ are comparable to H2O). F- has a strong hydration sphere, while hydration of most monovalent ions is weaker. See Marcus, Ions in Solution, Table 2.8.\n\nYou can't push just the cations through.\n\nThis in no way contradicts the hydration explanation given by other posters.",

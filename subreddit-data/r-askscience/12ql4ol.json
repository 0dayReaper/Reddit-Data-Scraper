            "comment": "To add to what others have said, hopping requires very large forces - the longer you're airborne relative to your time on the ground, the bigger the forces.  The strength of your bones and muscles is proportional to surface area (length squared), while the loads increase with animal weight / volume (length cubed), so even with the same jumping pattern, a big animal is subject to disproportionately greater loads than a small one.",

            "comment": "Claws aren't good for hopping :( \n\nBunnies and kangaroos have thick pads to absorb landings and tendons/muscles that redistribute momentum. It's just a totally different anatomical structure that we would expect if the animal needed to leap very far or travel long distances. Everything about the T-rex was built to be an apex predator, meaning strong and hungry. It didnt need to move very quickly or change directions the same way prey would.",

Birds have two legs, but they don\u2019t have long tails. Crocodiles and other reptiles have long tails, but are four-legged. And so, to those early paleontologists, [the kangaroo seemed like a good model to base dinosaur poses off of](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Examples-of-dinosaurs-from-the-kangaroo-era-A-Tyrannosaurus-and-Triceratops-by-Charles_fig3_323200849)\u2026it was a relatively large two-legged animal with a long tail!\n\nNow we better understand dinosaur posture\u2026*Tyrannosaurus* held its body horizontally to the ground, and didn\u2019t drag its tail. But like I said\u2026looking at the old drawings of \u201ckangaroo-pose dinosaurs\u201d, you can see how the modern kangaroo inspired those artists.",

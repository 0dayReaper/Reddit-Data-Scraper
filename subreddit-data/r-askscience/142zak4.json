            "comment": "A **multi-vortex tornado** is a type of tornado in which two or more columns of spinning air rotate about their own axes and at the same time revolve around a common center. A multi-vortex structure can occur in almost any circulation, but is very often observed in intense tornadoes. These are often encompassed within the parent circulation of a tornado, and aren\u2019t visible.\n\nA **tornado family** is a series of tornadoes produced by the same storm cell. These tornadoes may occur at the same time or in succession. A tornado family is different from a cyclically tornadic supercell, which is a storm that produces multiple tornadoes over a longer period of time with breaks in between.\n\nSo a multi-vortex tornado is one tornado with multiple spinning columns inside it, while a tornado family is multiple tornadoes from the same storm.",

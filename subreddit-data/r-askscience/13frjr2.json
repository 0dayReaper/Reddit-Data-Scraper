            "comment": "Some things that may come into play in this question:\n\n&gt;[On average, we found that cells accumulate 1.14 mutations per cell division in healthy haematopoiesis and 1.37 mutations per division in brain development. In both tissues, cell survival was maximal during early development. Analysis of 131 biopsies from 16 tumours showed 4 to 100 times increased mutation rates compared to healthy development and substantial inter-patient variation of cell survival/death rates.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7042311/)\n\nIf we were to wildly assume 1 cell division per day, for 6000 years, that would be 2,190,000 divisions. \n\nIf we multiply 1.2 average mutations per cell division X 4-100 times the mutation rate in some cancer cells, X 2,190,000 divisions we would get somewhere from 10,512,000 - 262,800,000 mutations that have occurred since the original source dog. \n\nDogs have about 20,000 genes made of about 3 billion base pairs. \n\nAgain, this uses some pretty non-generalizable and wild assumptions, but it\u2019s probably pretty safe to say that a big chunk of the original dog\u2019s genome is just lost forever.",

More than 10,000 genes carry nonsynonymous variants, and 646 genes have been lost. \n\n\u2014[Transmissible Dog Cancer Genome Reveals the Origin and History of an Ancient Cell Lineage](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1247167)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine that a viable animal could be cloned from something with hundreds of missing genes and millions of mutations. \n\nIf the genome wasn\u2019t so damaged, could a dog be cloned from it?  Dogs can be cloned, under highly specific conditions animals have been cloned from cell lines ([Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8598906/)), and mice have been cloned from a melanoma ([Reprogramming of a melanoma genome by nuclear transplantation](http://m.genesdev.cshlp.org/content/18/15/1875.short)) so many of the pieces are in place, but it\u2019s far from off-the-shelf technology. \n\nSomeone will ask about cloning by CRISPR-based mutations on a different background, and that too remains theoretically but not practically possible.",

            "comment": "The genetic makeup of tumor cells tends to not resemble the organism they stem from. Chromosomal abberations of every possible kind are regularly found in tumors, getting worse with more passages (meaning culturing and splitting in cell culture or even propagation in vivo). Cell lines like HeLa (stemming from Henrietta Lacks) aren't considered human anymore by some scientists owing to their hypertriploid nature and chromosomal count of anything between 60-80.\n\nSo the chance that an intact diploid karyotype can be retrieved from those cells (not taking into account the mutations that led to the malignant transformation in the first place) is extremely unlikely.",

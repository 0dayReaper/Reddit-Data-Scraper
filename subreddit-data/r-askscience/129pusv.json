            "comment": "There are a couple distinctions to make in answering this question:  \n\n1) There are different crudes with different compositions.  So if you are talking about changing crudes, the answer is, \"Yes.\"  Not all crudes have the same proportions of components to begin with, so you will get a different mix of products when you fractionate a different barrel of oil from a different crude source.\n\n[Rainbow crude](https://www.crudemonitor.ca/crudes/crude.php?acr=RA), for instance, is a light crude (as in low density, low viscosity), and has 8.6% of its composition in the C5-C6 hydrocarbon/light naphtha range and 18.9% in the C7-C9 hydrocarbon/heavy naphtha range.\n\n[Western Canadian Select](https://www.crudemonitor.ca/crudes/crude.php?acr=WCS) crude, on the other hand, is considered a benchmark heavy crude, and also has about 8.5% of its composition in the C5-C6 hydrocarbon/light naphtha range, but only 6.6% in the C7-C9 hydrocarbon/heavy naphtha range.  And half the benzene/toluene/xylenes content, 0.7% vs. 1.5%.\n\n2) But I don't think you are asking about changing crudes, I think you are asking about the separation of a given crude into different petroleum fractions.  Here, the answer is, \"No.\"\n\nPetroleum is fractionated by distillation, which simply separates the components of a mixture based on their boiling points at a given temperature.  So given a source of crude, you can only fractionate it into the components that are already there.  That being said, you can cut the fractions a little differently.  For instance some consider *heavy* naphtha to be the C7-C9 fraction, but others may include C6-C12.  So in a sense you could change how much \"heavy\" naphtha you get, but this is really a matter of labeling.\n\n3)  However, Fractionation is only one of the processes that take place in refining crude oil.  [Other processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_refinery#Chemical_processes) in a refinery do modify the composition of various streams, and use them as feedstocks for an array of petrochemicals.\n\nIn particular, [Catalytic Reforming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalytic_reforming#The_reaction_chemistry) modifies the composition of a naphtha stream by isomerizing alkanes and dehydrogenating naphthenes to make more aromatics.  This increases the octane of the reformate, but comes at a cost.  You give up about 1% yield from a barrel of oil, for each unit increase in octane rating. (See for example, the second page of this [Colorado School of Mines', class handout](http://inside.mines.edu/~jjechura/Refining/09_Reforming_Example.pdf).)\n\nAnd refineries have Alkylation units (that alkylate benzene to form higher aromatics), and may have a [Coker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coker_unit) (to pyrolyze the very heavy residue from distillation to squeeze out a little more naphtha, and make coke), or a Steam Cracker (to make olefins from ethane, propane and butane), etc.\n\nSo fractionation itself won't change the end products of a given crude, but there are a host of other processes used in refining petroleum, that can and do shift the product slate that ultimately comes from a given crude.",

                            "comment": "New generation refineries and the large massive integrated refineries can tweak the output a little.\n\nHistorically, output is usually fixed at time of construction.\n\nRoughly, you can use a FCC to get to 40% petrochemicals, or use a mix of conventional technology such as selective crude choice and multiple conversion units to get up to about 60% petrochemicals.  It's very difficult to connect multiple conversion units in a chain and selectively turn some on or off on demand.  \n\nExample: Hengli Petrochemical in China can shift it's petrochemical output from 10-40% from the same feedstock, remainder as gasoline or fuels.  It's kind of insane how they can tweak the levers to change their factory so much.  It's worth mentioning they can only do this because the site is so incredibly massive it can cover the cost of the additional equipment to do that.\n\nSaudi Aramco have some processes that can produce 70-80% petrochemicals from crude oil.  It's unknown have efficient that process is or really how it works.  It's cutting edge stuff and probably that high because they control their raw materials and plants so tightly (vertical integration, yo).\n\nCrude-to-chemicals processes do exist, which result in close to 100% petrochemicals.  Sacrifice is yield, since you need to use fuel to run the additional process steps.\n\nProbably worth mentioning a single new plant modification is costing $50MM-$100MM.  A new refinery is several billion dollars, you're looking at decades to recover that cost.  Hence, nobody does it unless their primary oil field collapses and they need to reconfigure for a new crude source, but even then, it can be cheaper to simply import similar crude from further away.\n\nIf you spend enough time on Reddit, you have read about the US based Koch brothers (and their election interfering).  They got rich by building/owning large integrated refineries that can take multiple crude oil sources and shift production as demand changes.  If gasoline market is down, they shift to more lucrative petrochemicals/plastics or vice-versa.  It makes their factories less boom/bust and a stronger stabler long-term growth option.  It allowed them to outcompete their smaller competitors who would frequently rake in cash for a decade then go bust in a downturn.",

            "comment": "I think the bones would include an epipubic bone.\n\n'Epipubic bones are often called marsupial bones because they support the mother's pouch in modern marsupials (\"marsupium\" is Latin for \"pouch\").\"\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epipubic_bone\n\n\"Despite the well-established anatomy nomenclature for the marsupial skeleton, there are no names for the epipubic bone structures. Epipubic bones are paired bones articulating with the pubis and projecting cranially in the ventral body wall, present on the pelvic girdle of cynodonts, monotremes and marsupials.\"\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34195985/",

            "comment": "Well they found diprotodontid remains in excellent condition, so that's about self explanatory. As the text says, diprotodons were directly linked to wombats (marsupial) as well as macropods ( roos, also marsupials). Because they know roughly where this creature sits in the evolutionary tree, they can confirm it is a marsupial. All its relatives in the past and future were marsupials for a very long time.\n\nLet's make an analogy, say you find some vertebrae and a   skull, complete with teeth, and these remains resemble a lot those of a dolphin. They just aren't exactly like any other type of known dolphin species. Perhaps we can't know in detail how it lived, but we can publish and say we found a new cetacean species, period. We are not going to speculate this dolphin was too different in its lifestyle and reproduction to any other dolphins we know, unless we find some kind of bizarre new evidence (ie., Eggs with fossilized embryos).",

            "comment": "The enzyme maintaining its an active conformation is only one component required for successful DNA polymerization. The other is the presence of double-stranded DNA with a recessed, free 3\u2019 end. (like a primer bound to a single-stranded template). At those temperatures, at least under PCR conditions, the DNA isn\u2019t in the proper configuration.\n\nIt should also be noted that every cycle up above 90C, some of the Taq in the reaction does irreversibly denature, with both the temperature and hold time contributing to the extent to which this occurs. Each cycle, less and less will be active when the temperature drops again.",

Plankton that thrives at the surface does sink very slowly when it dies so there is a constant shower of microscopic creatures alive and dead throughout the water column.\n\nThere is stuff that floats to the surface when it is pulled up by the tides like some seaweeds that are naturally buoyant so they can stand upright from the seabed.  Much of this floats on the surface and even reaches the beaches some of that floating debris may have creatures attached to it.  It then rots on the beaches and gets dragged back into the sea and sinks. \n\nHowever when boats discharge \u201cbycatch\u201d some of it may float on the surface but that\u2019s mainly because the cavities inside the creature that are normally squeezed closed by the ocean pressures have filled up with air by being brought to the surface. Again as it decomposes what isn\u2019t picked of the surface by scavengers will sink to the bottom.",

            "comment": "Most sea creatures are not positively buoyant (positively buoyant=will float, rise), and those uncommon creatures are forced to swim down or they will rise to surface (there are some, mostly sharks, that must swim constantly to stay underwater, below surface).  Most life is near neutral and slightly negatively buoyant, and will slowly sink if it stops swimming or stops forcing its flotation bladder (if they have one) to be expanded.\n\nFor dead body to rise, it has to produce and contain enough gas to become buoyant (to float).  The gas comes from decay of the flesh and organs (the gas is mostly carbon dioxide).  Deep sea creatures do not often gain and keep that buoyancy long enough to make it to surface.  Either explode while rising and the bubble expands, or get chomped on by scavengers, letting the gas escape.  Without a gas bubble, they sink.\n\nSome aquatic life, such as many bony fishes, have a gas bladder that they use to maintain buoyancy (to keep at the same level without either rising or sinking).  The bladder collapses to a relaxed state when the fish dies, so whether it floats or sinks depends on how \"full\" the bladder would be at death and whether pressure is high enough to force it to collapse or low enough to let it expand. Many shallow water, or fresh water, fish with a gas bladder will float when they die, at least at first.\n\nMost things sink without floating, and things deep in the sea that might, don't generally make it to surface without being torn apart.  Humans (and other land animals) that die by drowning will sink, until a few days of decay makes a gas bubble inside, when they may sometimes float.  Land animals that die in water but do not drown still have air in the lungs and generally float until the air escapes and/or is replaced by water.",

There's the saying that Lake Superior doesn't give up her dead because it's so cold that bacteria can't decay the body so no gases bloat the body. I'm assuming the ocean is similarly cold, especially at the bottom, so the deep sea creatures may never have a chance to bloat at all?",

From 10m it doubles in volume, creating these bloated bodies you've probably seen in newspapers or TV. From 2000m it expands to 200x the starting volume - so if there is enough gas to move this body, it will explode long before it reaches the surface and then sink again.\n\nLake Superior is 147m deep on average, 406m maximum. That might already be too deep for floating up to the surface, not sure.",

Look up \"whalefall\".\n\nThe short of it is, if it doesn't wash up on a beach, it will eventually fall to the ocean floor and become devoured by an entire ecosystem of detritus eaters.\n\nNow if you look at the number of giant squid that have washed up on shore, it's frightenly few.  Maybe one every 20 years.  So if they aren't washing up on shore then they're falling to the ocean floor.\n\nRapid decay will form gasses that will float the dead sea creature to the surface.  But the deep ocean is cold and decay is slowed.  So deep sea creatures rarely float to the surface.",

One interesting thing that happens with fishing nets that are discarded in the ocean is that they repeatedly float and sink due to the dying animals caught in them. As the animals caught in the net die, they sink down with the net. As the net falls, it catches more live marine animals. As they die and bloat, the net goes back up, catching more animals. As they die and release their gasses, the net sinks back down. The nets keep buoying, killing animals endlessly.",

I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s true, but taking in to account that the Appalachian Mountains are the oldest on earth (and the erosion they\u2019ve faced in the billions of years since they\u2019ve existed,) I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s possible that all land may one day be eroded by various causes to a levers where the Earth might one day become entirely covered in ocean?\n\nThank you for your input!",

Liquid to gas is called evaporation.\n\nMore generally speaking, the phase (solid, liquid, gas, plasma) of matter is dependent on the ambient temperature and pressure. What rules this process is the phase diagram of the given matter. If you want to know more look up the phase diagram (and more specifically the triple point) on Wikipedia.

The lack of a magnetic field is the cause of the atmosphere being stripped away.\n\nThis is an outdated view and in the scientific field actually researching this, the consensus on this has really disappeared over the last 15 to 20 years. Most researcher are actually questioning this and the paradigm is sort of shifting to the opposite. Note, this does not mean that solar wind was not important, more that a magnetic field does not necessarily protect against the solar wind.\n\n&gt;Besides if insufficient gravity was the issue, it would not have formed a notable atmosphere in the first place.\n\nThis is incorrect. The atmosphere of a planet is constantly being heated by solar irradiation. This causes the atmospheric particles to gain energy, and thus there will always be a small fraction with energy high enough to overcome gravity and escape. This is a very slow process, certainly much slower than all the possible process of how the atmosphere may have been formed.\n\nAdditionally, the magnitude of all the possible effects of erosion by the solar wind is also highly dependent on the mass (gravity) of the planet. If the solar wind increases the energy of a particle just above escape velocity, it may escape.\n\n&gt;Mars still has sizable gravity, being larger than every moon in the solar system many of which have their own atmospheres.\n\nMars' gravity is an order of magnitude smaller than Earth's or Venus'. The only solar system moon with a dense atmosphere is Titan, all the others have an \"atmosphere\" much smaller than Mars' atmosphere. Titan's atmosphere is sort of a scientific enigma. But Titan's mass is actually closer to Mars' mass, than Mars' mass to Earth's and Venus'. Titan is also much further from the Sun than Mars, and thus receives much less solar radiation and solar wind. As well it is thought that Titan started out with a much bigger atmospheric budget.",

That\u2019s assuming the current albedo, which will increase (and reflect more energy = less energy to warm the planet up = becomes even colder) when ice sheets grow. If Earth can freeze over in the past, it can definitely still freeze over at the current luminosity. [In fact, due to carbon-silicate cycle reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere over time, it becomes *more* vulnerable to slight changes in CO2 level and becoming a snowball Earth than when the Sun was dimmer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06216).\n\nMore note on the carbon-silicate cycle: the cycle is a balance between CO2 outgassing and CO2 capture via erosion of volcanic rock. The rate of erosion depends on the temperature of the planet, and thus as the solar flux gets higher, so does the erosion rate and the CO2 drawdown rate. The result is a decreasing trend of atmospheric CO2 over geological timescales.",

A magnetic field only protects against sputtering escape. Jeans escape is a thermal escape mechanism which depends on the amount of heat provided by the parent star, the escape velocity at the upper atmosphere, and the mass of the molecules. Additionally, when the Sun gets hotter, there will be more UV light hitting the upper atmosphere causing photodissociation of water molecules, and Hydrogen escapes much easier than water molecules.",

The present mountains are cenozoic in age, rejuvenation of a mature landscape after the erosion of the original mountains. Even the original Appalachians were less than half a billion years old.\n\nAs to the substance of your question - technically possible, but so highly unlikely it's effectively a no. It would require all uplift mechanisms to cease - no collisions between continents, no volcanic uplift by subsurface magma chambers. There's active uplift in a bunch of places - the Himalayas for one. You'd basically need to wait for that uplift to stop and hope no more started, which isn't likely. \n\nIn the distant future when the Earth's core cools to solid and stops driving plate tectonics, it's possible. But when that happens, we'll have bigger problems. Not that it should worry anyone alive, that's billions of years in the future.",

            "comment": "Short answer: no. Land is always being created.\n\nLong answer: tectonic plate movements result in new land always being created through vulcanic eruptions. If this occurs in the ocean it forms island chains or archipelagos like Hawaii (small) or Japan (very large). If that oceanic plate subducts below a continental plate (which it eventually will) the island chain doesn't subduct with it, instead that rock and land is scraped off the subducting plate and squished onto the continental plate and in the process builds up that continental plate and is called accretion with the new land added called terranes. The west coast of North America has grown from Idaho to its current coast mostly through continous accretion of island chains and archepellegos.\n\nPlates subducting under continents also melt and release lava as they sink into the mantle resulting in volcanoes inland from subducting plates. The Cascadia range (including mount St. Helens) on the west coast of North America is a good example of volcanoes resulting from subduction melt. This also creates new land.\n\nSome vulcanic eruptions release just an astronomical amount of material. These come in two forms. The explosive and effusive forms. Explosive forms do release huge amounts of rock and ash but this is spread around and will deposit that rock and ash over larger areas. This can be substantial, even laying as much as several hundreds of meters deep of rock and ash, but most of the time it's just another layer of sediment a few centimeters to a few meters thick. Effusive eruptions though can build land. These are lava flows, you can see small ones like the Mt Kilauea in Hawaii which is a result of the mantle Hotspot below that area. That Hotspot has built the entire hawaiia island chain and its a small Hotspot. The truly massive effusive eruptions are called traps and the resulting rock after the magma has cooled is called a large igneous province. Some famous traps are the Siberia traps that once covered land from Europe to China in basalt rock to a depth of 3.5 km at its thickest. The Deccan traps once covered most of Southern india in lava. And the mascerene platou, an underwater igneous province with only a few islands above water like Mauritous Island, is longer than the neighboring Madagascar.\n\nIf igneous provinces form on land they directly add to the continental mass. If they form in water they form new island chains and plateaus that will eventually be accreted onto continents.\n\nFinally there is mountain building, called orogeny by geologists. When tectonic plates collide there will be some level of compression of the continental plate and that will result in buckling and shearing of rock. Some of that pressure will result in rocks being pushed upwards against gravity forming massive mountain ranges. This happens during any subduction but the more mass and resistance there is the more force and the higher the mountains. So ocean to continental subduction results in coastal ranges like the west coast of South America. Ocean to continental subduction with terrane accretion results in large and layered ranges like the north west coast of the US and Canada. And when you have a continental plate subducting under another continental plate then you get truly absurd uplift and orogeny like the Himalayas where the Indian subcontinent is subducting under the Asian continent.\n\nAnd this brings us back to the Appalachians. Before the appalachians formed North America was mostly covered in shallow seas as the previous iceball earth Era had eroded everything down to sea level and then sea level had risen as the glaciers melted. The Atlantic didn't exist at that time, instead in its place was the iapetus ocean that was closing as the oceanic plate subducted under north America (called Laurentia). As it subducted it accreted on a small island chain forming a small mountain range. And then it accretted on a very big island archipelago, a subcontinental called baltica that is what is now today's scandinavia, forming a rather large mountain range probably similar to the California with its coastal range and Sierra Nevada range. And then it collided with Africa and south america (called gondwana). This was a very large orogeny, similar or even bigger than the formation of the Himalayas. Which is fair since this wasn't a subcontinent but a continent larger than north America. It formed an absolutely gigantic mountain range with probably the highest mountains in the world. And while subduction isn't easy to stop, the pressure and resistance of two continents shoving into each other can do it and so the mountains eventually stopped growing and the subduction stopped. Several million years later this contact point would form the weak point for the continents to split apart into the modern north America, south America, and Africa and the formation of the Atlantic Ocean. But before that we have a lot of erosion.\n\nRemember that shallow sea that north America was? Well by the time that gondwana collided with Laurentia that had mostly filled in thanks to all of the eroded material carried by rivers all the way from the eastern mountain ranges. Land as far away as Arizona was made up of sediment from mountains in Georgia. So yeah, a large amount of erosion is constantly occurring. But lots of that erosion is actually building new land by filling in bays and shallow oceans. The mississippi river delta, the ganges River delta, and the pearl River delta are all massive river deltas that have created new land from their sediment and in many cases stretching far into the ocean. Florida is pretty much the result of sediment filling into shallow seas. And while some of this is washed away, much of it forms new bedrock that slowly builds up the continental shelf, expanding it further.\n\nSo to sum it all up, no, as long as tectonic plates keep moving then new land will always be created. For the longest time land was created much faster than it was eroded or subducted and the continents grew very quickly. Of course the more continents mean more erosion so eventually that slowed down but even today the continents are growing. New land is created through vulcanism either directly onto continents or in the ocean and then stuck onto the continents. Mountains are constantly created as continents collide and plates subduct and those then erode down and fill in oceans and expand continental shelfs. And while the appalachians have eroded down to some lovely hills and small mountains, there are new Himalayas and new coastal mountain ranges and so on growing elsewhere.",

This movement can create new land through processes such as volcanic activity and the uplift of rock formations.\r  \n\r  \nWhile it is possible that some areas of the Earth could experience extensive erosion and lose a significant amount of land, it is highly unlikely that this process would be widespread enough to leave the Earth with only oceans.",

By this metric, Earth presently has a surface roughness of 0.00031223 (a pool ball is about 80x smoother than Earth by this metric. That \"shrink the Earth down to the size of a pool ball and it would be smoother than it\" myth is bunk. Earths got humps).\n\nIf Earth was a perfect sphere, the spherical shell of water would need to be 2700m deep. For a mountain to erupt from this shell anywhere on earth, the maximum surface roughness of Earth would need to be 3.7 times less than it is currently. \n\nIts impossible to know how this value changes over time as we are no longer able to measure the height of the tallest mountain on Pangaea or before, but I would think the maximum and minimum elevations would remain somewhat consistent, though their location might change. So the last time the earth was that smooth was probably during its formation when much of the surface was molten (and therefor not covered with liquid water).\n\nIt may have been possible that Earth was once completely covered with liquid water after the surface cooled, when most surface roughness was the result of meteor impact and not yet techninics, but it is not likely to ever return to this state. It would help us if there was more water on Earth, but most of it likely came from ice bearing meteor impacts during Earths formation and we are not due for many more of those. We already hit most everything there was to hit. Fingers crossed...",

            "comment": "Obviously there are other posts that answer this with a lot more understanding, but I've always been curious about this since High School. We were taught about how the mountains formed and pretty basic plate tectonics. I remember being told about the three boundaries, divergent, convergent, and transform. From this, one would assume convergence and divergence would have to happen at the same rate in order for more crust to form to keep the continents. However, I remember our textbooks saying that more crust goes into the mantle than is produced, leading to the logical conclusion that we are at a net negative in crust production.\n\nThe illustrations we were given would seem to back this up as convergence always has one half going into the mantle and the other seeming to cover it. Emphasis on the \"covering\" part because a couple of my less intelligent classmates figured that was the only way it happened, as if one plate covered another plate instead of being pushed upwards. Not to mention the fact that divergence happens which seemed to just pull plates apart, only forming crust at a very low altitude in the ocean, or volcanoes which are only capable of making small islands when the conditions are right. Hell, even the Magic School Bus episode on plate tectonics only showed loss of crust. So it's amazing to me that somehow in all of this the Earth isn't entirely flat.\n\nMaybe someone can explain this? Could it just be the case that we are in the middle of a natural \"land cycle\" on Earth, and that it will eventually become all oceans again for several million years until new land is produced in another cycle?",

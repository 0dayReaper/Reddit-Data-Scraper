            "comment": "Another subtle thing here -- elements aren't radioactive, isotopes (combinations of specific numbers of protons and neutrons) are radioactive.\n\nSo we would call any atom with six protons a carbon atom. But this can have many different numbers of neutrons, and we can number all these different isotopes with the total number of protons and neutrons which make up the nucleus. So carbon-12, which has six neutrons in addition to the six protons, is the most common form of carbon on Earth, and this happens to be stable. Carbon-13, which has seven neutrons and six protons, is also stable, but carbon-14, with eight neutrons and six protons, is radioactive. If you've heard of carbon dating, it's the radioactive carbon-14 which is key to this process!\n\nSo why do isotopes decay? Any time you have a nucleus, very short-ranged attractive forces between nucleons (a general term for both protons and neutrons) is holding the nucleus together. If you put enough energy into the nucleus, it will break apart into smaller pieces -- like if you stick a strong magnet to a piece of metal, you need to use a lot of force to separate them again. And for each nucleus, the amount of energy this takes is different.\n\nRadioactive decay happens when an isotope can transform itself in some way that releases energy, so that the end result needs more energy to break up the resulting nucleus (or nuclei, for certain types of decay) into individual protons and neutrons.\n\nThe patterns we see in this interaction are:\n\n- Nuclei like to have the same number of protons as they have neutrons.\n\n- Nuclei prefer the number of protons and number of neutrons to both be even, so that each nucleon can pair up with another of the same type.\n\n- Certain 'magic' numbers of protons or neutrons are more strongly preferred: 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126\n\n- Nuclei like to have fewer protons, since protons have positive charge, and they repel each other.\n\n- Individual nuclei are most stable around 56 total nucleons.\n\nSo carbon-12, with its 6 protons and 6 neutrons, is pretty stable. Carbon-14, even though it has that magic number of neutrons, tends to decay into Nitrogen-14, with 7 protons and 7 neutrons, since the preference to match proton and neutron numbers is stronger than the other preferences.\n\nYou've also asked about hydrogen, and uranium, so let's chat a bit about those.\n\nHydrogen has only three isotopes -- hydrogen-1 is just a proton, hydrogen-2 (also called deuterium) has one proton and one neutron, and hydrogen-3 (also called tritium) has one proton and two neutrons. Only hydrogen-3 is radioactive, decaying into helium-3, with two protons and one neutron.\n\nAll of the many uranium isotopes are radioactive -- uranium has so many protons (92), that it wants to separate them out in any way it can. For the most common uranium isotopes on Earth, they emit a helium-4 nucleus (2 protons, 2 neutrons), which we also call an alpha particle. Helium-4 is special, since it needs a lot of energy to break apart for being such a small nucleus (take a look at the rules above and see if you can see why!), and so this is often the preferred way to get rid of protons.\n\n\nFor an even more complete answer, we could talk about how nuclei are produced in stars and supernovae, and how these processes build heavier nuclei out of lighter ones in ways that predict the abundance of different elements and their isotopes on Earth. But I've already talked your ear off, so I'll defer on that for now.\n\n\nPlease feel free to ask questions if anything is still unclear!\n\n\nMost significant source:\nIntroductory Nuclear Physics (K.S.

Along these lines, mass isn't a \"thing\" by itself, but more like energy in a place creating a stickiness in the Higgs field.  Similarly, there is energy binding the quarks together into the nucleon (proton or neutron), and this energy is kind of like rubber bands holding the quarks relatively close to each other.\n\nA neutron is 1 up and 2 down quarks, while a proton is 2 up and 1 down quark.  So, to go from a neutron to a proton, one of the down quarks must decay and yield an up quark.  So when the decay happens, the down quark becomes an up quark and a W boson (which is unstable).  This leaves us with a proton (yay, this is the end result nucleon we wanted) and W boson, which because it is unstable turns into an electron and neutrino.\n\nA neutron is actually slightly heavier than a proton, and the mass/energy difference between the two sums to make up the electron and neutrino.",

                            "comment": "The other commenter is spot on about beta decay, where the neutron essentially turns into a proton. An electron is needed to balance the charge, since we can't create that positive charge on the proton out of nothing. We also need a very small and difficult to measure particle called an anti-neutrino (as in antimatter), to balance out the 'regular' matter we created when adding that electron.\n\nThis is specifically the case of 'beta-minus' decay, since the electron has a negative charge, and the electron is the easiest way to see that this decay has happened.\n\nThere's also the very similar case of 'beta-plus' decay, where a proton turns into a neutron, and emits an anti-electron ('positron'), along with a regular neutrino. This type of decay occurs when a nucleus has too many protons, rather than too many neutrons. For example, carbon-11, with 6 protons and 5 neutrons, decays into boron-11 with 5 protons and 6 neutrons.\n\nThese particles created during beta decay don't just show up for free, we do need to account for the energy needed to create them (the famous E=mc^2 equation). Electrons and positrons don't interact through the strong nuclear force that holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus, so it's easier to get to an overall lower energy state by producing one of these in the course of transforming a nucleon, and letting the electron or positron escape the nucleus, rather than trying to just kick out the extra proton or neutron directly.",

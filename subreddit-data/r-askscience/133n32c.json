    "postText": "I live in Ireland and usually when it's warmer during the summer we get a lot of lion's mane jellyfish and barrel jellyfish which are relatively harmless. It's possible that you could get what feels like a nettle sting from certain species but generally they're fine. \n\nWhat I'm wondering is, if these jellyfish and box jellyfish share a similar diet of small fish, why have large Chironex Fleckeri box jellyfish evolved to have the ability to kill multiple people within minutes while also being almost completely transparent? \n\nI can understand with snakes and spiders as they need to defend themselves and kill relatively large animals. But jellyfish face similar threats everywhere like turtles, whales, seabirds etc and they eat similar food like small fish and crustaceans while having massive differences in their ability to harm humans.",

            "comment": "I don't know about jellyfish specifically, but venomous is not a linear scale, it depends both on the venom and the victim. So while \"most venomous to humans\" is a fairly solid concept, \"most venomous\" without that \"to humans\" caveat is not really a thing.\n\nIt's quite possible that the jellyfish's natural prey are relatively resistant to whatever is in it's venom and it just kinda by fluke happens to be really bad news for humans.\n\nFunnel web spiders are arguably the most venomous spiders to humans but relatively harmless to cats, dogs and birds.\n\nBut killing people is not what their venom is evolved for, that's just an accident, they are actually after insects and small lizards.",

They get more immune to the venom so they get stronger venom. 50,000,000 years later you have snakes that could take down an elephant and tiny little prey that can withstand it.",

We're awake 16+ hours per day/night.  We can run for days if we have to. In the wild, we're like Jason Voorhees. No matter how far they run, we seem to be behind every blade of grass, giving them no respite, calmly following their trail.   \n\nNevermind  how resilient we are to poisoning. sure box jellyfish can kill us, but most venomous things can't.  Our livers regenerate, we have two kidneys, 5 lung sacs. We drink poison for the fun of it, and use it to mark our special occasions. We like the buzz we get from smoking nightshade (specifically Tobacco) so much we can get addicted to it easily. one of Natures best insecticides gives us a small addictive boost.   \n\nOur muscles slowly breakdown for digestion when we are in caloric deficit, which makes us live through famine much easier than other apes that don't share that mutation. \n\nThere's a reason why wild animals are naturally afraid of us. We aren't the strongest or the toughest, but as Archimedes once said, \"give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum, and I can move the world\".",

Jellyfish washed up on the beach are consumed by foxes, other terrestrial mammals and birds.

It's a *total* fluke.\n\nThere's quite a bit about the evolution of venom that's mysterious. It's thought that the ancestral snake was venomous, and that venom is fairly cheap to produce biologically, yet non-venomous snakes have evolved. Why? Last I checked nobody knows. \n\nAnother thing to remember is that evolution doesn't design things. A creature accidentally gets better, and then it propagates. The answer to why one critter is the best can absolutely be \"dumb luck\". I personally suspect that's the case for why humans became technological first.\n\nEdit: Reminder that evolutionary change is not always adaptive, sometimes it's a side effect and sometimes it's just random.

I would think professional biologists (and related fields) understand evolution quite well, yet these are exactly the kinds of questions that they often ask; moreover, [they still speak and investigate with teleological language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology_in_biology) -- and arguably this is part of the field's paradigm, not just some casual quirk. It's not technically correct, but there a lot of behaviors of scientists that are not technically proper in themselves.\n\nFor example, u/PHealthy agrees that the \"why\" of evolution is always fitness of reproduction (and, more or less, yes) and links Bentlage etal 2009. But that paper is, I'd argue at a glance, directly asking and giving several answers to *why* the box jellyfish evolved as is that goes beyond a one-sentence catch-all. \n\nTo take maybe a related field as an example, economics: why does an actor behave a certain way in a market, e.g. why does WalMart set the price of a pillow at $2? To maximize profit (as with everything). Case closed? No further questions? What if there's actual complexity under the surface? Maybe the pillow has subsidies or unaccounted externalities that pervert the price, or perhaps the pillow price is set lower or higher than expected in offset of other products or a general store pricing strategy.",

But you can generalize the idea since most models of economics, social science, and psychology have actors behaving according to some [psychological egoism](https://www.qcc.cuny.edu/socialsciences/ppecorino/ethics_text/Chapter_5_Teleological_Theories_Egoism/Psychological_Egoism.htm) (such as rational self-interest). \n\nSo maybe a human Mom-and-Pop store manager pricing the pillow at $2 wasn't optimal for profit, but \"they felt like it\" reflects the fact that at the time they changed the price, it was the optimal decision for their self-interest, say to maximize short-term pleasure vs effort. (This is of course unfalsifiable and circular logic, which is the key criticism of these models, as the linked page notes.)",

The variation in offspring is random, yes, but natural selection isn't, not on the evolutionary scale.\n\nSince mutations keep happening, there is basically a \"wear and tear\" on the genome that tends to turn in into gibberish over time. Also, building any protein expends energy and resources (amino-acids). For these two reasons, when a living thing keeps a gene, it's because there is some pressure to keep it, there'll be a reason it was an advantage. Otherwise it'll quietly get erased, like a sandcastle moat you stop reinforcing.\n\nTo note, 1, genetics are complex and sometimes a gene has two different effects, one of which is incidental or even bad, but it doesn't get erased because that bit of gene is just too important. Like Sickle Cell Anaemia harms your circulation but protects from malaria. And 2, yeah *between* multiple species, weird random coincidences can happen. The banana didn't evolve to be curved so people can hold it better, and the box jellifish might just be coincidentially dreadful to humans.",

Venom is expensive to produce. That's why so many venomous animals dry bite so frequently; they don't want to waste it if they can help it. Venom also doesn't just drip out of your mouth, you need an entire mechanism to deliver it, which also costs energy, and to store it, which also costs energy.\n\nVenom is very complicated. It isn't just some saliva by-product.",

As far as I can tell there\u2019s no information about the latter and the former still seems unlikely.\n\nDo you mean \u201cstructural change\u201d? \u201cStructuralist\u201d generally refers to structuralism, which is a pseudoscientific alternative to the Darwinian foundation of evolution, in which physical changes to body plan are somehow inherited. I\u2019m guessing you mean change in the phenotype, but in that case you need to remove the conceptual barrier between drift and change because they aren\u2019t separate categories of the same domain. Drift is simply the trend of changes accumulating in a population because they have neutral effect on fitness, in which heterozygosity among multiple neutral alleles at a given locus decays to zero. This can result in changes to the phenotype which are neutral, or (more often) in non-coding regions of the genome. Since those mutations in non-coding base pairs occur at a regular rate, we can use them to establish the displacement in time between two individuals and their LCA. Note than drift does not produce directional changes in physiology, so you can\u2019t really attribute these long trends in evolution of specific physiology to drift. If a mutation perturbs the phenotype and alters fitness, and then selection begins acting on that alteration relative to the population, then that is natural selection and not drift.\n\nFirst, non-venomous snakes still produce venom, and the 100 million year-old LCA of all living snakes itself produced many kinds of venom, and venom itself (as a broader reptilian trait) is about 100 million years older than that. You map this out in the same way you would make the phylogenetic history of any other protein, because that\u2019s what venom is: a protein. Serpentes (snakes), Helodermatidae, Anguidae, Varanidae, and Iguania all share morphologically related venom proteins, and share the same venom-producing LCA as snakes. As those lineages started differentiating from each other, they refined the protein structures of their venom and its anatomical location. Snakes produce venom only from their maxillary gland, and as a group added more than 10 other unique proteins to the pool, so this realm of physiology is not really a candidate to be attributed to drift.\n\nBryan Fry would be the person to read up on the evolution of venom as a broader trait, as he did much of the work here (including establishing this \u201cvenom clade\u201d). He runs the Venomics Lab at\u2014naturally\u2014UQueensland in Australia.",

Bipedalism, flight, succulence, spines, parental care of offspring, and colour vision to name just a few.\n\nNew traits appear randomly. To take off in a species, the new trait needs to be better for the current environment than the traits that species *already has.* So, for example, thick fur is a big advantage in cold climates but humans are unlikely to evolve fur coats, because we already have highly effective adaptations for cold climates (we make clothes!).\n\nEarly stages of venom producing traits are likely to be weak toxins and have undesirable side effects on the host. For example, venom production might have a metabolic cost, or might interfere with other functions, or might unintentionally poison mates/offspring\u2026 etc. If an organism is struggling to survive, the small edge venom gives may offset the drawbacks. But if it has already evolved effective survival traits by the time it gets that first venom mutation, evolutionary pressures may go the opposite way.",

                                    "comment": "This may be accurate in some cases of venom specificity, the overall analogy to allergies is misleading. \n\nWhile allergies are indeed a reaction to foreign proteins (for the most part), they are an immune hypersensitivity reaction, which typically requires a primary exposure to \"prime\" the immune system for that antigen (or a colossal dosing in some cases, if memory serves). Similarly, though by a different mechanism, Dengue fever has an immunopathology whereby infections after the first are substantially more dangerous due to immune hyperreactivity.\n\nMany toxins include both enzymes and other functional molecules, as they are often co-delivered with the dual purpose of subduing and digesting prey. While these are indeed typically proteins, their toxicity arises by direct action of the protein upon the host's cells, frequently targeting neural function (to paralyze or incapacitate) or tissue (to aid in digestion). When deployed against a larger, non-prey animal, they tend only to interact with chemical structures similar to those in the prey animal to which they are adapted - in the case of funnel web spiders, to a portion of a sodium channel protein, causing overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system and cardiovascular collapse. While humans and (one of the prey animals) appear to share a similar structures in the protein, those of cats and dogs must have diverged enough that the structure of the toxin no longer produces a similar interaction, rendering it harmless. \n\nThe important distinction is that this process does not involve the immune system and, in fact, the immune system would protect the victim had they been previously exposed - which is essentially how antivenin works - immune components of another previously exposed animal are isolated and transferred to a victim to \"borrow\" the immunity they've developed.\n\nIn the case of garlic and onions, these plants produce enzymes that break down chemicals in their own cells that interfere with the function of essential enzymes in dogs and cats (and hurt our eyes), causing liver (maybe kidney?) failure due to the buildup of toxic metabolic byproducts that they no longer have a way to break down without those enzymes. We have similar enzymes in our bodies, but inversely to the case of the toxins, ours are not shaped in a way those chemicals can interact destructively with them.\n\nSo while you're correct to connect these phenomena at a deep level, as they all arise from dysfunctional protein behavior caused by external agents, there are an awful lot of protein interactions that can go wrong, and how and where they do is important to understand, especially in the contexts of evolution and medicine.",

I agree that a lot of qualities that animals have evolved are different but I don't agree that a jellyfish with less potent venom have an objective advantage over one with stronger venom. \n\nIf the only disadvantage between strong and weak venom is a few millions of years of evolution that an individual jellyfish will never experience as a disadvantage, then it is objectively better. \n\nIf you can provide a sizeable disadvantage to stronger venom in this case, I will agree that they are \"different\" and not \"better\".",

One animal can be faster stronger and more agile than other, and still not be better (even in reality, those abilities might come at the cost of a higher metabolism, and higher diet requirements for example). Maybe creating a stronger toxin requires more energy to produce, or a specific diet, or certain conditions. And if any of those are the case there's arguments that it's not better or worse than other similar adaptations in similar species",

Before you were saying \"they are different and not better\" you're saying \"you have to admit a difference exists before saying they are better\" which conveniently fits your argument by forcing me to agree that their is a difference. \n\nThe reality is of course there is a different but one is better. If I was a jellyfish, I'd prefer to be able to kill a fully grown human in 2 minutes than give him a nettle sting because there is no down side. I don't need to eat more food or stay in fresh water, I just get more powerful venom which means it's objectively better.",

Namely sewers, ground drains, good old evaporation, lay of the land, local ground geology, tidal differences to name a few.  Once the hurricane has passed though then levels will drop fairly quickly.\n\nThe biggest problem will be both the environmental (mobilised sewage etc...) and physical property damage that has occured.\n\nLots of standing water means mozzies and vermin.  Contaminated waters means polluted ground water sources, damaged agriculture infrastructure, dead livestock, crops wiped out and quarantined/destroyed  (certain crops absorb harmful nasties). \n\nInfrastructure wise lots of work gutting out the drainage system and clearing hurricane damage will take place. Damaged electricity/phone/gas infrastructure will need checking too.  \n\nNow let's talk about the houses that are damaged. \n\nThere are typical damage assessments that can be done but there are 2 typical factors that ultimately determine damage costs and severity - the depth of water and the time water stays around (ok and type of building materials used)\n\nAnything typically above 400mm for a day or 2 means that the lower floor needs gutting and requires a complete rework.\n\nNow think of this in terms of demands locally.  Every homeless person will  need rehousing, every house will require skilled trades to repair them(and they WILL be in  demand). It will take years for all affected properties to be repaired by all trades.\n\nBut as a starter for then why not google what happened during hurricane katrina or the 2005 flooding carlisle in the UK.  Some of the stats are just mindblowing and heartbreaking.\n\nPs also google the lake levels rises during hurricane Katrina due to the low air pressure alone.  It makes for amazing reading.\n\nSource : i am really a flood engineer \ud83d\ude0a\n\nEdit: Thank you for my first ever gold(s!!!) and all your messages.",

The section labeled [The Storm Surge and Flooding of New Orleans](https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/katrina/understanding.html) is an example of what mitchanium mentioned. \n\nReading that section says not all that height is air pressure alone, some of it is water pushed by wind and the result of water pushed into enclosed spaces, but the [model](https://serc.carleton.edu/research_education/katrina/understanding.html) shows something like 10-12 feet of water on the southern shore of the lake. Whether it was just air pressure of a combination of that and wind, that is still a wall of water created by nothing more than the movement of air. \n",

Water is often considered incompressible because no naturally occuring pressure differentiall will cause water to expand to a significant degree. What will change is the actual mass of water in the lake.\nThe pressure will draw more water to the low pressure area if the lake is connected to another body of water, the ocean in the case of katrina or from the other side of the lake of it is big enough. This is like sucking water through a straw. The water moves up the straw but drains it from another source.\nAlso, regardless of whether not the lake is attached to another source, the water will go up simply because the low air pressure means there can be less water vapor pressure (dryer air).\nSo the air outside of the eye is very wet (obviously) but the air in the eye is not. The decreased pressure means thinner air and thinner air cannot store as much gaseous water. So the air that was previously very humid in the higher pressure areas can no longer hold all of its water resulting in the water vapor condensing back into a liquid. This isn't on the scale of rain, but enough to contribute towards the amount of water in a lake.",

When air pressure is equal on both sides, the water level will be equal on both sides. If air pressure is greater on one side than the other, it will push down the fluid on the side with greater pressure.\n\nNow imagine if one side is free to open atmosphere, and one side has a vacuum. What you now have is a  [Barometer.](https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MercuryBarometer.svg#mw-jump-to-license)  A U shape still works, but this design is effectively the same. \n\nAssuming we made a decent vacuum, the only gas on the vacuum side is vapor pressure at a low enough pressure we assume it to be zero.\n\nSo in situations where the ambient pressure decreases, more fluid is pulled towards away from the vacuum - i.e. The apparent vacuum grows larger, the column of fluid hung from the vacuum shrinks and the fluid in the new lower pressure environment raises slightly.\n\nA barometer is useful for measuring absolute pressure, but the effect of barometric effect of atmospheric pressure changing the height of a fluid can be observed without requiring the side with a vacuum.\n\nThe lowest observed pressure in hurricane katrina was 920 mb, roughly 9% below standard day sea level pressure.\n\nI'm on mobile and need sleep, but I'm determined to do an example problem and show my work tomorrow if you want me to.",

The local environmental justice org TEJAS and Sierra Club have an early rundown:\nhttp://content.sierraclub.org/press-releases/2017/08/least-10-houston-area-chemical-facilities-and-oil-and-gas-refineries-have\n\nCorpus Christi has experienced several chemical leaks, some on purpose. Flaring off large amounts of gases is part of shutting down refinery operations, but it's not pretty. The Valero refinery had a flare so large that nearby residents called the fire department.\nhttps://patch.com/us/across-america/huge-flaring-corpus-christi-refinery-sparked-power-outage\n\nAnd Koch Industries (Flint Hills Resources) refinery in Corpus Christi was flaring benzene last Friday, as it shut down:\nhttps://www.eenews.net/stories/1060059445\n\nFarther north, the greater Houston region is having several serious problems at various petrochemical facilities, where flooding was/is much worse. Companies have disclosed 2 million lbs of chemical releases to TX government:\nhttp://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/29/hurricane-harvey-chemical-danger-242142\n\nThe Arkima industrial chemical facility in Crosby TX is in danger of a serious fire or explosion. The manufacturing process involves keeping certain chemicals at very low temperatures, just below freezing, but the plant has been without power for days and at the moment is still inundated with water:\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/arkema-warns-it-cant-prevent-potential-chemical-explosion-in-texas-1504124326\n\nExxon and Valero both reported releases of carcinogens, specifically benzene and toluene. Lightning struck a Dow Chemical plant and set off a benzene leak. And Flint Hills flared benzene, see above.\n\nDays ago, people in the Houston area reported acrid smells in the air. Keeping in mind that not all dangerous gases have a scent, but what is described here isn't a good thing:\nhttps://newrepublic.com/minutes/144487/unbearable-petrochemical-smells-reportedly-drifting-houston\n\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality shut off all air quality monitors before Harvey hit, and Houston Press says it best:\n\"...TCEQ has shut down all of its air quality monitors in the Houston area to avoid water and wind damage related to the storm. In other words, plants and refineries are being left on the honor system. They can report whatever is emitted, but if they don't do so, there are not any state air quality monitors running to catch them.\"\nhttp://www.houstonpress.com/news/houston-ship-channel-communities-deal-with-weird-smell-during-harvey-9741373\n\nRegarding the other person's comment here about chemicals releases being permitted by the EPA:\nEven when EPA gives a permit, pollution is still pollution. Flaring can be very dangerous, and this crisis is demonstrating how much (extra) pollution is created when refineries shut down in a \"controlled\" situation:\nhttps://qz.com/1066097/hurricane-harvey-oil-refineries-are-polluting-latino-and-low-income-neighborhoods/\n\nAs Quartz notes, and community advocates on the ground have stressed, all of this pollution, on top of the rain, floods and storm, tends to hit low income refinery communities the hardest. Many of those communities are majority people of color. And while the storm doesn't discriminate, some aspects of the petrochemical and real estate economies clearly do. \n\nThe Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst has a helpful annual ranking of air, water &amp; climate pollution, down to the individual facilities and community demographics:\nhttps://www.peri.umass.edu/top-100-polluter-indexes\n\nFor all of these reasons and more, I appreciate the organizations listed here that are all working on rescue and recovery operations in Texas right now. Please consider donating. (I am not affiliated).\nhttps://anothergulf.com/a-just-harvey-recovery/",

Any flammable compounds are completely incinerated and rendered inert under regular operating conditions. I know there was a very intensely reported issue with HF found in refinery flare gas in the US, but you will like the alternatives even less.\n\nSource: process engineer  \n\nEdit: that plant with the power failure is what I am worried about. It produces peroxides, which are notoriously powerful oxidizing agents. Hence the general warning about explosions. ",

The system helps divert water away from homes and instead floods the streets (since it is safer there). Those incredible pictures from Houston interstates are at least partly a result of that flood control system. It is also a reason why they did not issue an evacuation order, because people would be sitting in traffic while the water rose, resulting in unnecessary deaths.",

The reason that \"Global Warming\" fell out of favour as a term was that it creates the false impression that everywhere just gets warmer. An unusually cold, snowy winter IS the result of climate change, because precipitation always comes from somewhere. More heat=more evaporation=more snow. The point regarding weather was just that one area being cold does not mean that the rest of the area isn't hotter than it used to be. \n\nHurricanes relate more directly to actual warming because hurricane seasons and strength depend heavily on ocean temperature. A warmer ocean means a longer hurricane season and more powerful storms. ",

Houston has a very, VERY high amount of impervious cover (as many cities do) and is very flat so it is very difficult for water to infiltrate the soil or even drain properly unless the storm sewer is capable of doing so\n\n2. After doing some analysis of current events, the consensus is that the lack of zoning regulations (I.e. building houses in obvious flood plains)/sheer amount of people living in the city and its rapid expansion have contributed to the city not being able to handle this type of storm. Most consulting firms will design the storm sewer/drainage systems to be able to route an 100 year storm, which apparently the storm sewer network in Houston is not capable of doing at all whatsoever ",

When soil is flooded to the point that water can no longer infiltrate, it begins transporting the top 2 layers of soil. This is the organic layer (such as leaf litter) and the surface layer (topsoil). These are the two most nutrient rich layers of soil, and often the most polluted (by pesticides, foreign chemicals, or trash). This is not good for a few reasons:\n\n1. The main source of nutrients have now been stripped from the plants.\n\n2. The sub-surface layers are exposed, and from what I understand about Texan soil, this is mostly clay.\n\n3. Pollutants are now being transported and dumped into waterways or varying soil environments. \n\nSome of the nutrients will be returned to soil elsewhere, but most of these nutrients will flow to waterways and into the ocean. This will not be good for the Gulf, as it is already hypoxic (lack of dissolved oxygen due to nutrient runoff. Essentially, the large amount of nutrients results in algae blooms which deprives the water of oxygen). The reduction of plant matter will also reduce the stability of the soil, meaning it will be more likely to erode in the future. \n\nThe second portion of this is that clay now becomes the surface layer. Because clay is so small, it takes water significantly longer to move through the soil profile, thus lowering the hydraulic conductivity. This means water runoff will now become a large problem in the affected areas for months or years to come.\n\nThe third portion is pollutants. Chemicals and trash are now being transported to different soils and waterways. Not good.\n\nAs for the smaller scope impacts, soil horizons will become disrupted. Soil stability will be negatively impacted. Nutrients will be forced through the horizons quicker, leaving a deprived soil. Many soil microbes (the most important indicator of soil health, depending on who you ask) will be killed off.\n\nSo, yeah. It's disastrous for soil and the overall environmental health of the area.\n\nEDIT: Also, as for plants, many can survive being submerged for up to a weekish. Many cannot. The flooding will inhibit root nutrient uptake, which will result in decay. Water-logged roots are also more susceptible to organisms that specialize in root-rot.      \n\nEDIT2: /u/BadBadger42 asked a question about highly expansive clays. These are what we call shrink-swell soils. The clay fraction is expanded in area when water-logged, which causes extra stress on infrastructure. This is the leading cause of flooding basements, and why many buildings in Texas do not have basements. Taking a look at [this soil map of Texas](https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/nrcs144p2_000979.jpg), most of the area effected is Vertisol. I'm sure you've all noticed a vertisol before, when it dries it looks like [this](http://geotechfoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cracked-soil-texas.jpg). The \"swell\" of the soil is caused by the micropores between the clay particles becoming over-saturated - and when it dries (\"shrinks\") those cracks are left behind. Vertisol is the shrink-swell classification of soil. I would imagine that the effects of shrink-swell on infrastructure will be exacerbated by the flooding.  ",

I loved looking at all the critters scramble about when I dug them up. I liked the different colors I found in the ground when I was on family vacations.\n\nBut I never took it as a serious desire until college. I was going to be a civil engineer until I took an intro to soil science course. I quickly realized I loved how all of the sciences are incorporated into it - soil physics, soil chemistry, and soil biology are all equally important. \n\nI guess it's hard to explain why I enjoy it so much. If you like lab work, you can do lab work with soil. If you enjoy being in the field, you can do field work with soil. It reaches into more areas of study than I previously imagined. Agriculture, hydrology, landscape management, engineering, and urban design just to name a few. ",

During the summer, it has been observed that disruptive storms (i.e., hurricanes) do a pretty good job at mixing the water column and breaking up stratification (a principle component for the development of the dead zone); this mixing appears to have lingering effects by drastically reducing the size of the dead zone even after stratification re-emerges. Conversely, these winds may enhance upwelling- and downwelling-favorable conditions that simply shift the location and shape of the dead zone and not help to alleviate it at all. \n\nAnother interesting component in all of this is the probable shift in species distribution of phytoplankton; the silica-rich freshwater inflow would replenish a Si-limited system and allow silicifying algae (e.g., diatoms) to bloom again (as opposed to dinoflagellates and other phytoplankton that are commonly associated with harmful blooms). What is interesting (and somewhat cool if not for the hypoxia) is that this has pretty substantial biological, chemical, and geological consequences in both short- (intra-year) and long-term (decadal or more) time-scales.\n\nAlso (pre-)congrats on finishing!

I had one research plot on a Mid-Atlantic barrier island that, after Hurricane Sandy, was buried under 3 feet of sand brought laid down by the storm surge. Made for quite an amazing soil profile. Houston is a bit inland to experience this directly, but I would imagine the coast would experience a similar effect.\n\nAs far as hydraulic conductivity goes, I don't think there will be much in the way of a change. The soil in southeastern Texas is dominated by Vertisols, a type of soil that contains a subsurface layer rich in shrink-swell clays. This layer (when wet) is the most limiting factor for the transmission of water through the soil profile. If, as OP posited, the entirety of the topsoil was removed by the hurricane the hydraulic conductivity would remained unchanged. OP was correct in stating this soil loss would exacerbate runoff issues, the recovery timeframe of \"months to years\" was a bit optimistic. \"Lifetimes to millenia\" is a much more realistic scale.\n\nSoils might be a bit of a moot issue, however. The Houston area has been blessed by a near total lack of any regulation on impermeable surfaces and floodwater management. Bit difficult for soil to do its job in the hydrologic cycle in such an environment. The amount of stormwater making its way to sea through groundwater flow is going to pale to insignificance compared to what is going to flow directly into the gulf through overland flow. Combine that with the presence of major chemical industries in the area and we have the potential for widespread contamination.",

This means micro-organisms that can grow in anoxic conditions will continue the nutrient cycle, and micro-organisms that require oxygen will use other sources. This results in an overall reduction of nutrient availability (only certain forms of nutrients can be absorbed by roots).\n\nPlant growth is determined by the \"Law of Minimums\". This means that the least available nutrient will control plant growth. So, let's say you have 200 lbs of lumber but only 20 nails to build a treehouse. The quality and size of that treehouse will be restricted by those 20 nails. In a water-logged system, one of the macronutrients will be massively reduced. \n\nI say \"one of\" because soil science is a young profession. We still aren't entirely sure exactly which nutrients will be deprived. There's still much to be discovered, but this is the leading hypothesis.",

In an urban setting like Houston, it will flow into storm drains along the curb, into small pipes like 18\u201d diameter, then those feed into larger pipes like 48\u201d or even concrete box culverts which might be 15\u2019 wide by 4\u2019 high (the possible dimensions are endless). Those large pipes/culverts drain into the streams and rivers. Everything eventually keeps draining downhill to the ocean, bay, bayou, etc. \n\nQ2: In general, this probably won\u2019t change much regarding the landscape. It will look like the same place as it did before, except structures around main drainage channels may have washed away.\n\nQ3: No permanent lakes or rivers will be made. Everything will drain naturally in a matter of days. If there is a low spot that doesn\u2019t drain by gravity to a storm sewer, channel, stream, etc., that depression could hold water longer but it will eventually infiltrate into the soil and/or evaporate.\n\nUp here in Pennsylvania, we design pipes/culverts to carry up to the 100-year storm which would be like 8\u201d of rain in 24 hours. Not sure what they design for down south, but their 100-year storm is probably like 12\u201d+ of rain in 24 hours. This hurricane is dumping 4+ feet in some areas so there\u2019s no way to drain that much water very quickly. Just have to wait.",

Or there is precipitation so strong, water cannot infiltrate into the soil in time. But, in time, all that water flows away, because groundwater is basically connected system of water bodies, so excess water is distributed to other areas via basic runoff and via basic runoff, especially surface runoff, it flows back to terrain depression, rivers and other areas with low altitude. In this area it's the gulf of Mexico for most of this excess water.",

But even where I'm at, in southwest Louisiana, we nearly flooded because everything is backed up. Our rivers, gullies, buyous, and lakes are at capacity and -can't- move due to storm surge keeping the amount they can drain down.\n\nRainstorms that normally would flood nothing more than a street are now backing into people's homes.\n\nIt certainly is a laundry list of problems, not just one or two things.

It seems crazy that people would build houses (and an airport) at the back end of the Addicks reservoir.

Is it required when you buy the house?",

There's a big debate going on right now about what areas the national flood insurance program should cover and how it should be structured. A lot of the expenditures have gone to people that have been flooded out multiple times - a sign that maybe they shouldn't be there in the first place. Then again, what do you do if someone buys a house in that area and they don't have money to move?\n\nI agree, building at the edge of the reservoir is asking for trouble. Deciding what to do is very political. Texas is a very pro-development environment. You might have heard some people repeating the words, \"Growth! Jobs!\" while simultaneously ignoring the externalities of those choices. This is one of those cases.\n\nIt's not an easy question either way. How much land do you really want to leave undeveloped? There's 40 sq miles in both reservoirs. Should it have been 60? 80? ",

Definitely.\n\nThe worst thing about decisions that prioritize preserving existing property values in bad locations at taxpayer expense is that you're signing up for endless and possibly worsening costs over time.  It might be far smarter to offer people buyouts to move elsewhere and bulldoze the house at any location that has received payouts numerous times.  Something like \"We'll buy your house from you at a slight premium, and you can move elsewhere with the money, but if you decide to stay you and any subsequent owners will be on your own next time.\"\n\nI don't understand the attitude that people should unconditionally be subsidized at taxpayer expense to live in dangerous areas.  People should have the freedom to choose, but also to shoulder the costs of that choice.  You have to allow leeway for mistaken risk assessments and genuinely unforeseeable catastrophes, but once it's clear that there is a problem the support should wind down over time.\n\nIf they can afford to rebuild every decade or two, fine, but why should everyone else be on the hook for that choice?",

Hot In SoCal, deserted trailers from the 50's halfway buried in sand. A law chair, somehow, still planted where its long dead owner once placed it. The Dunes don't deserve a second blink, untill your get close enough to get it in between your toes. Its not sand, but rather decades of stocking fish in a toxic lake caused the entire sediment layer to be a mass grave. \n\ncool shit. ",

It will just take longer since there's more water.\n\nIf you dump water slowly into your tub with the drain open, the tub will not collect any water. If you dump it in fast enough, the tub will fill/flood/overflow. But it will still drain, and once you stop adding water it will eventually empty. Until it finishes draining though, the flood will remain standing.\n\n&gt; Will permanent rivers or lakes be made?\n\nNo matter how much water you add, or how fast, you won't ever permanently fill the tub, unless of course the water being added is so forceful that it changes the landscape, i.e. it collapses your tub and causes broken rubble to fill in the drain hole.\n\nLikewise, if there is some closed container where water collects after the hurricane, then it also would have collected there after a normal rain. Because it's a closed container. Not because of how much water fell.",

Doesn't help, we depend on the water flow to filter South, where flooding is now occuring (which can cause a wave of water to flow up...think of waves coming and going) Harvey's passing through now has left standing water now that is not fully draining, but not really flooding.  Most homes (estimated at 60%) are not fully finished due to lack of qualified contractors and lack of building supplies.  Of those 60%, only 30% are living in their not fully finished homes, leaving the rest displaced and looking for housing in a market with low inventory.  Hurricane season is no joke and more serious than taken.",

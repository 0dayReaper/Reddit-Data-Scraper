As a result, twilight on Mars lasts up to two hours, *longer than* is typical for low-mid latitudes on Earth (i.e., polar twilight notwithstanding, but Mars has that, too). Volcanic ash can occasionally produce similar effects on Earth.\n\nhttps://mars.nasa.gov/mer/spotlight/20060807.html\n\nhttps://mars.nasa.gov/MPF/science/clouds.html\n\nEdit: \\* as well as noctilucent clouds that form because water vapor nucleates on the dust particles",

            "comment": "Well it does have that effect on places like the Moon, but on Mars the 'atmospheric lens' effect is not only replaced but pales into insignifigance by 'particulate glow'. On Earth places like deserts get this effect when a significant amount if dust is in the atmosphere. The 'below horizon' at ground level Sun hits the duat particles and they reflect the light causing a 'false dawn' or an 'extended sundown'. Check out some of the photography it is etherally beautiful.",

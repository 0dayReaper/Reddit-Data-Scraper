            "comment": "&gt; Has any research been done on the impact of atmospheric pressure on seismic activity?\n\nYes, this is a question that geologists/seismologists have considered for a long time (e.g., [Landsberg, 1940](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/TR021i002p00227)).\n\n&gt; My reasoning is that if the earth's surface/crust experiences less pressure due to changes in atmospheric pressure, then maybe seismic movement can occur easier than usual.\n\nSo broadly, the underlying logic is sound, i.e., anything that can change the stress state in the crust can *potentially* change some details of the statistics of earthquakes making a given event that is near failure either more or less likely to occur depending on the nature of the change in stress state. In terms of surface influences, the most common consideration is that some processes that reduces mass above a fault (e.g., less surface water) effectively reduces the normal stress on the fault and means that the shear stress required for the fault to slip is less (i.e., it's an easier for an earthquake to occur), but there are other mechanisms by which these surface changes can potentially influence fault and earthquake behavior. In detail, a variety of surface details, mostly related to hydrologic changes (e.g., changes in groundwater, changes in snow mass, changes in precipitation, etc) have been suggested to modulate the detailed statistics of earthquakes (e.g., consider the discussions and linked papers in these two FAQs, [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/earthquake_seasons/) and [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/climate_change_earthquakes/)). \n\nNow, the trick with barometric pressure changes potentially working in this way is that these tend to be *very small* compared to things like changes in water mass. Per the Landsberg reference, they've been considered, but even in that review, it was generally assumed that they were not of sufficient magnitude to actually do much. There have been occasional suggestions that barometric pressure changes could influence subtle statistics of earthquake sequences, like those observed in the sequence following the 1992 Landers earthquake in California (e.g., [Gao et al., 2000](https://www.nature.com/articles/35020045)), but subsequent work has shown that these are likely better explained by seasonal variation in hydrology (e.g., [Johnson et al., 2017](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aak9547)). Similarly, there was a lot of buzz around the result from [Liu et al., 2009](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08042), which suggested that the low pressure from systems like typhoons might be sufficient to trigger so-called [slow earthquakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_earthquake) at subduction zones (like Taiwan), but again, subsequent work has suggested that the triggering attributed originally to barometric pressure changes are probably better explained by (larger) changes in water masses (e.g., [Hsu et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JB011807)).\n\n**TL;DR** It's been researched and occasionally there's been results that are suggestive of barometric pressure changes being able to influence the exact timing of earthquakes or earthquake like processes, but few of them have held up to scrutiny and most seem better explained with changes in water mass instead.",

Regarding which variables to control for in an experiment - One should be thorough but you can't include everything. You have to assign a plausibility of each input having an effect. In the case of atmospheric pressure, I would (perhaps wrongly) attribute air pressure changing to the category of 'likely insignificant'. It has an effect but well below the noise.  Rationale: Quick search shows barometric pressure varying from 99.0 to 103.1; a variance of \\~4-5%...and pressure is a function of force on area...the earth's surface has a LOT of area, so there may be some astronomical forces at play. \n\n5kpa works out to 500kg/square meter...about the average force of 1.5 heavy cars stacked vertically, bumper to bumper, everywhere. (tesla model 3 is 2400kg on 8 square meters, averaged).  That in human terms is a lot. In geological terms is ...almost literally nothing. A cubic meter of gravel weighs 1700kg...so atmospheric 5kpa pressure maximum deviation is like adding or removing a 30cm layer of gravel everywhere. Not nothing...but 30cm on 30-100kilometers of crust works out to between 100,000 to 1,000,000 less material than is already there. The equivalent ratio of dusting some smaller-than-average viri on your skin. (assuming dermis 1-4mm, divide by 1/1,000,000 is 4-40 nanometers. There isn't a good size references for stuff that small)",

With reference to the specific question here, the extent to which barometric pressure changes matter critically depends on whether we're asking whether they might be able to induce an earthquake that was not already nearly about to happen versus whether there able to modulate the exact timing of an earthquake that was already about to happen (e.g., could they influence whether a given earthquake happens today or tomorrow). The magnitude of these changes are such that unquestionably they are not relevant for considerations of the former, but for the latter, we potentially need to consider the effect of *very small changes*, so it's not really valid to simply discount them off hand because they have a small magnitude when asking this specific question. This is why this potential has been investigated (e.g., the references in the original response). As it turns out though, it's hard to isolate the potential influence of barometric pressure changes compared to water storage / mass changes that often occur in concert with them.",

When I arrived at work at 4:30 AM, the sky was clear and crisp, full of stars. I unloaded a truck full of parcel post sacks, then wheeled them in to unload them onto a conveyer belt to be sorted. Nothing unusual.\n\nWhen the lights started falling from the ceiling, we ran outside, jumping off the loading dock, into the thickest fog ever. Walk ten steps and the building behind us turned into a faint glow. \n\nLater that day in geology class, we hypothesized that the rapid movement of the earth caused a drop in local air pressure, causing the moisture in the air to precipitate out into that fog.\n\nDoes that hypothesis seem viable now, or were we grasping for straws in a freshman geology class? For some perspective, in 1971, everyone was excited about this 'new' discovery called continental drift.",

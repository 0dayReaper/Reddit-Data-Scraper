Environmentalism usually feels like a bunch of looming catastrophes that never end up really being anything.  The fact that the reason they don't end up being catastrophes is that we take action to stop them is completely lost on the average person like myself, so that the original hype ends up looking like some chicken-little sky-is-falling shit, and we aren't even told that the sky WAS falling and we legislated against that.",

An administratively determined cap would be an enormous target for political lobbying, with annual battles pitting utilities against environmental NGOs.  Can you imagine the wangling when a cold December causes utilities to hit the cap prior to the end of the year?\n\nA much better option for unavoidable but undesirable emissions is a \"Pigovian\" tax, in this case a tax per ton of emitted CO2.  It applies leverage against emitters but without the wild market gyrations caused by a hard cap.",

Combine wafer thin margins with a 10-40% cut in efficiency and tack on long term radioactive material storage (due to concentrating uranium naturally found in coal)... CCS will happen when regulators force it down coal provider's throats and not a moment sooner.",

After that he reorganized them to work together with the formation of the EPA. He accomplished all that in his first 2 years in office.\n\nHe only vetoed the Clean Water Act because the price tag was considerably higher than what he had requested, and because a recession brought deficits to the forefront. But the Clean Water Act is still credited to him because he initiated the drafting of strong water protections and demanded that Congress to send him the legislation. \n\nAfter that he declared existing animal conservation acts to be insufficient and called upon Congress to bolster protections for wildlife, the result of which he signed into law the as Endangered Species Act.\n\nShit on Nixon for being a dirty, cheating sonovabitch, but the man's record on protecting the environment was impeccable.",

Even within the US the EPA designated specified sub-regions within the trading system to prevent a concentration of emissions (e.g.; all the Texas and East Coast coal plants remediate and sell their allowances to Ohio and Western PA, leaving those communities with the brunt of the pollution).",

I've had a few coal facilities shut down for which I was the state engineer and it's such a great feeling! This trend shows no signs of stopping- the world should celebrate with me!",

            "comment": "The reduction in the prevalence of acid rain in the US is largely been attributed to the success of the EPAs Acid Rain Program.\n\nAll rain is somewhat acidic from rainwater forming carbonic acid from rainwater reacting with carbon dioxide, but acid rain is particularly lower in pH. This is due to the reaction of rainwater with nitrogen and sulfur oxides to form the much stronger nitric and sulfuric acids, respectively. The primary source of these nitrogen and sulfur oxides is power plant emissions, particularly those burning coal. The Ohio River Valley contains a large concentration of these power plants, and acid rain issues in the US were largely concentrated around this region and points downwind (the Atlantic Coast).\n\nThe Acid Rain Program was begun in 1990 based under the Clean Air Act. It established a market-based (cap and trade) system of regulation upon which emitters of sulfur and nitrogen oxides were granted pollution allowances. Polluters were incentivized to voluntary undertake measures to reduce the volume of their emissions as they could sell unused allowances for profit.\n\nBy most estimates, the Acid Rain Program has been largely successful. The Pacific Research Institute has estimated that this program has reduced total acid rain levels by 65% from 1976 levels while the EPA estimates the program cost businesses only a quarter of what was originally estimated. Savings in property damage and human health costs, such as lowered incidences of heart and lung problems exacerbated by acid rain, most likely have resulted in the Acid Rain Program actually saving money, overall.",

            "comment": "It is still there, albeit most data shows a decline in the prevalence due to consistent progress in reducing emissions.  The pH ~~acidity~~ of rain is decreased (made more acidic) primarily through the action of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.  One of the biggest changes has been the result of a significant decrease in sulfur dioxide generation by China.  Parts of the US has seen some change, however other regions showed almost no improvement, if any at all regarding the pH of its rainwater in this timeframe.\n\nThe other aspect of this is that acid rain isn't nearly as harmful as people thought it was in the 90's, at least in terms of the public perception.  Acid rain is typically in the 5.0-5.5 pH range, with parts of the US seeing as low as 4.5 pH.  On one hand, when compared to something like a can of Coca-Cola which has a pH of ~2.3 this seems like it is nothing, but on the other hand, the effects of acid rain cover such a large surface area that it is not appropriate to compare it simply in terms of acidity.  There is a little bit of controversy as to just how harmful acid rain actually is, but most experts agree the most affected part of the environment are the various bodies of water, which are more susceptible to pH changes.  The amount and acidity of acid rain isn't enough to kill off wildlife outright in most cases, however it does cause the water to leech aluminum from the soil. \n\nMost of this information is pop science that is easily searchable.  I do not mean this in a pedantic tone, but rather as encouragement for others to search for themselves because it is a topic that has a lot of data but also quite a bit of emotions and opinions that are not based on facts.\n\nEdit: pH not acidity in the second sentence.  Very few things increase when it also decreases :D",

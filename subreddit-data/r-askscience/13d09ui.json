In contrast, a multicellular organism is composed of specialized cells that work together to carry out the functions of the organism.\n\nIn a colonial organism, the individual cells are often identical or nearly identical in structure and function. Each cell in the colony carries out its own basic life functions, such as metabolism and reproduction, but the colony as a whole does not have any specialized tissues or organs.\n\nIn a multicellular organism, the individual cells are specialized to perform specific functions, such as digestion, respiration, or movement. These cells are organized into tissues, which are in turn organized into organs, and these organs work together to carry out the overall functions of the organism.\n\nExamples of colonial organisms include certain types of algae and bacteria, while examples of multicellular organisms include plants, animals, and fungi.",

How can a stinger cell survive on its own?  A gas-producing floatdome cell?  Don't jellyfish have 2 stages to their lifespan?",

To make these things align with our human minds, we've drawn a line, but that's just what it is - a line we've drawn.

However, different parts of the DNA are \"activated\" in the muscle cell than in the neuron, resulting in different RNA and protein molecules being created in different amounts.  This leads to an immense diversity of cell shapes, sizes, and functions, even if all have the same DNA.  How the different parts of the DNA are activated / suppressed in different cells or individuals is the subject of the field of Epigenetics (and, in the case of multicellular organisms, Developmental Biology), but it's generally done by putting temporary chemical \"marks\" on different parts of the DNA or the proteins associated with the DNA.",

A lot of DNA encodes for \u201cif this, do this 3x, else not at all\u201d type scenarios. The fact that we are broadly symmetrical with arms, legs, fingers the same approximate length is a marvel of biology. DNA is also not static, and can be affected by changes in our environment. This is probably most obviously seen in cancers, where DNA is damaged and allows cells to reproduce unchecked.

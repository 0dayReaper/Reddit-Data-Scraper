            "comment": "It is pretty much impossible to melt wood. The reason is that as you start heading the wood up, its constituent building blocks tend to break up before the material can melt. This behavior is due to the fact that wood is made up of a strong network of cellulose fibers connected by a lignin mesh. You would need to add *a lot* of energy to allow the cellulose fibers to be able to easily slide past each other in order to create a molten state. On the other hand, there are plenty of other reactions that can kick in first as you transfer heat to the material.\n\nIf you have oxygen around you one key reactions is of course combustion. But even in the absence of oxygen there are plenty of reactions that will break up the material at the molecular level. The umbrella term for all of these messy reactions driven by heat is called [pyrolysis.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis)\n\n**Reference:**\n\n1. Schroeter, J., et al.

Intensity of the shade is determined by hardness. The amount of gum or wax **binders** used during the production process affects the hardness, softer producing intensely black markings while firmer leaves light markings.[4] ... There are wide variations in artists' charcoal, depending on the proportion of ingredients: compressed charcoal from burned birch, **clay, lamp black pigment, and a small quantity of ultramarine**. The longer this mixture is heated, the softer it becomes.[6]  \n  \nMost lamp black is oil soot, not wood charcoal. Wood charcoal is comparatively expensive and time consuming to make.\n\n\n  \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charcoal_(art)\n\n\n",

When the summer comes around we would make charcoal for barbecues from logs that would otherwise be used as firewood. \n\nWe had a giant iron kiln about 8ft wide which you would neatly stack full of wood. Then you put the lid on and seal it all with clay/soil. Then you just dig half a dozen vents under the sides and light a fire in them. You just control the burn by covering or opening the holes. You want white smoke billowing out the vents, if it starts the turn black then it\u2019s burning the carbon so you suffocate it. \n\nIt eventually just burns through and you have to wait for it to completely cool. Takes about 72hrs. It was cool because me and my boss would have camp out underneath this giant military parachute which we would suspend up in the trees. That was a chill job. ",

Left smoldering for days, what was left was charcoal, they bagged up and sold on the side of the road.\n\nI imagine the point about burning a lot of wood to make charcoal was to later have a fuel that could burn much hotter than straight wood.\n\nAlso, the type of wood and temperature the charcoal was made at can affect it's grade.  It would make sense to burn a bunch of scrap wood to make high grade charcoal, because you could sell.that for a good profit, or use it to smelt steel.",

What's happening is that the visible flame is the area where all the oxygen is gone.   The heat pyrolyses the fuel,  vaporizing it. But with no oxygen it can't burn. The fuel floats up through the flame to the edge where there is oxygen available.   Once at the edge it can burn,  and does so, releasing heat.  This heats up the vapor still in the flame making it hot enough to visibly glow in the visible spectrum.   Hence, visible flames.\n\nIe campfire flames aren't showing you combustion.   They're areas of glowing fuel vapor stuck in an oxygen-less bubble.  When they reach the edge of that bubble they burn, vaporizing and heating more fuel, and eating up oxygen so the inner bubble stays O2-free.  The combustion is on the tips of the flames. The flames are just fuel lines. ",

The borders of the flame is where the combustion occurs, and where the most energy should be released.  That's why the edges are actually reasonably sharp for a gaseous construct.\n\nIt's full of hot, glowing fuel vapor well past its flash point just *begging* to ignite.  It just can't until it reaches oxygen.\n\nThe reason flame sizes stay so stable, is because there's negative feedback involved based on the rate the fuel is getting vaporized.  If you suddenly reduced how much fuel was being vaporized, it's quickly start consuming less oxygen, so the oxygen-free bubble would shrink until the surface area matches the rate of oxygen demand.  The bubble being closer to the fuel source means the fuel source gets hotter.  More particles start to vaporize, and suddenly more oxygen is being consumed, so the dead zone expands and the flame grows back to its natural size.\n\nIncidentally, a lot of this is driven by convection, and thus gravity.  Hot fuel particles rise, they suck up oxygen from the bottom of the flame and move to a tip.  In space, if you ignited some fuel, a fireball would grown outward uniformly as a sphere until all the fuel had consumed enough oxygen (or it got too cool to burn).  ",

You're missing the fact that the walls of the hollow cylinder still have volume, and smoke/flame isn't 100% opaque. Since the wall has volume, the angle light takes changes how much light is blocked by the wall. This means along the edges, more light is blocked, because it passes through more of the wall.",

The first is black body radiation from the relatively dense, hot, oxygen-deprived fuel vapors.\n\nThe second is emission spectra.  This is more prevalent in liquid, 'clean-burning' flames.  In addition to blackbody radiation, matter can emit light when it undergoes particular chemical reactions.  You may recall a chemistry class where you put salts over a flame and got really distinct colors.  Reds, yellows, blues, greens, etc.  Copper for instance, burns green.  Whereas black-body radiation is a broad spectrum (think bell-curve), these emission spectra are very sharp, distinct wavelengths (colors) of light.\n\nC2 and CO (and a few other compounds) emit blue light when they combust.  This is why your stove flames are blue.  They're not blue because they're hot - to get something to blackbody radiate blue would require it be hotter than the Sun.  The sun is *white* because while its temperature puts the center of its emissions in the greenish area, there's tons of red, yellow, green, and blue light all created.  To make the sun glow blue would require you move the center of the spectrum up far into the ultra-violet so that only a bit of blue, and no green, yellow, or red get emitted anymore.\n\nSo why does emission spectra dominate in one type of flame and blackbody radiation in another?  Because of complete or incomplete combustion.  Campfires incompletely combust their material.  The smoke that comes off a campfire is pretty much just un-burnt fuel, as well as other crap that doesn't really burn to start with.  This is why a chimney covered in soot could explode. And also why you can relight a recently-extinguished candle from its smoke trail (fun party trick). Incomplete combustion means you're getting a lot of carbon-monoxide, among other things.  And without high temperatures and lots of oxygen, you won't burn CO into CO2 very easily. \n\nWith a stove flame, you're mixing a spray of fuel with oxygen very thoroughly, and there's no extra crap inside - it's typically burn methane or propane or butane etc. Notice that you don't get much of any smoke. This lets you get more oxygen to all your fuel, and burn hotter.  So you get more complete combustion. And thus you get more blue emission spectra.  You also don't have as much solid fuel particles floating around, so you get less visible blackbody radiation.  That's why the flame burns more blue than white - white indicates reds and yellows mixed in.  It's also why you have to monitor for carbon-monoxide in your house - if your furnace is operating poorly, you may not be completely combusting your fuel, resulting in CO escaping before being turned into CO2. Which makes you dead.\n\nCharcoal is worth mentioning as a middle-ground.  It burns hotter than wood, and has fewer impurities, which is why if it's not in direct sunlight, you can see little wisps of blue flame smoldering on lit charcoal.  Though you can still get it to glow distinctly red if you put it in an oxygen-deprived environment.  Like coals deep in the heart of a campfire.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nSolid, unrefined fuel -&gt; Less oxygen and lower temperatures -&gt; Less complete combustion -&gt; less emission spectra and more glowing fuel particles -&gt; blackbody emissions more visible.  \n\nLiquid, purified fuel -&gt; More oxygen and higher temperatures -&gt; More complete combustion -&gt; more emissions spectra and fewer glowing fuel particles -&gt; emission spectra more visible.\n\n\n\n\n",

So hot that the gas, and the particle suspended in it, glow red and even yellow.  The edges of the flame is where the combustion is occurring, yes - that's where the heat is mostly being generated. But the gases inside the flame are absorbing that heat.\n\nCombustion in your car only occurs inside the piston chambers.  But the whole engine still gets really hot.\n\nRunning your hand painlessly through a flame is just due to the brief contact and the good insulation.  There's not enough time for the heat to transfer to anything but the dead cells on the surface of your skin. (If you're quick enough.  If you're not... well, you learn quickly.)\n\nGood question.",

In my plastic materials engineering course we were told that the bottle body is made of PET while the cap is PE, which makes sense as being thermoplastic means the processing by injection molding is much easier. The difference in materials is justifiable by the more complex shape of the cap and its inner thread, hard to achieve by molding PET. I think the reason why it is advised to separate the caps is because they are made of a particularly high molecular weight, 'precious' PE, not sure though.",

Well what happens when you leave dry ice out on a table? It doesn't \"melt\" (as in turn into a liquid)- it simply becomes a gas. That's because CO2 doesn't melt at atmospheric pressure- it undergoes sublimation instead.\n\nDoes that mean we can't have liquid CO2? Of course we can- anyone who has worked in a restaurant and lugged a new 20lb CO2 tank into position has worked with liquid CO2. The difference is- the CO2 in the tank is under high pressure so it ends up in liquid form rather than gas. When you open the valve- the liquid immediately becomes a gas due to the lower pressure. (Same idea with propane).\n\nIf we wanted liquid carbon- we would need a LOT of pressure and a high temperature. Temperature alone isn't enough.\n",

To make it into a liquid you have to put it under pressure.  We see something similar with a standard butane lighter.  Butane is a gas at room temperature and pressure, but if you put it under a little pressure like you find in a bic lighter it will be a liquid.",

However, they are also sucking up minerals and metal oxides from the ground, namely silica, sodium, and others. These oxides comprise some of the main ingredients in glass/glaze, and they stay in the wood after we chop the tree down. When we burn the wood, the carbon burns off, leaving wood ash, which is all the stuff that doesn't burn, i.e. the aforementioned metal oxides. At high enough temperatures (cone 10-12 or so/approximately 2300 degrees F) those metal oxides melt. During this stage of firing, the atmosphere inside the kiln is very volatile, and the melted wood ash is drawn around and through the kiln, and ultimately settles onto the pots, sometimes quite thickly. You'll see when you fire that the placement of the pots will determine how much ash they get. Wood kilns are a great way to learn about the technical aspects of firing, and it's super cool to be able to participate in a kind of firing that people have been doing for thousands of years. I hope your firing goes well!",

            "comment": "There are many chemicals or compounds for which the melting point is listed as \"decomposes.\" This is to say, that some chemicals do not pass through a liquid phase before becoming gas, or in other cases, the process of heating them enough triggers other chemical changes: the molecules are broken apart into smaller bits which are naturally gas at a given temperature.\n\nDry ice is a good example of this: at standard pressure, applying heat to it causes it to turn straight to a gas. Some of the amino acids do something similar: they simply vaporize when heated to a certain temperature.\n\nWhen you heat something to melting, you're causing bonds or crystal structures to weaken to the point that the molecules are capable of sliding around on each other. This holds true for most of the things we're used to: simple chemicals like water, salt, metals. But, if there are bonds inside the molecule that are even weaker than the forces keeping it a solid, then adding vibration (heat) is going to break those apart before the substance can get hot enough to liquify.\n\nWood is complicated, because it's got a ton of different substances inside it. When we make charcoal, wood is heated in an oxygen free environment. As the temperature is increased, a bunch of gases are released as water and oils evaporate, and sections of proteins decompose. Some of these gases can be condensed back into liquids, but I wouldn't call these \"melted\" wood: more that the wood released these chemicals as it was heated.\n\nHeat the wood even more, and you'll get charcoal, basically pure carbon. You could continue heating this for quite a while, up to 4000K, before it starts to change state. Unfortunately, carbon at atmospheric pressure does much the same as dry ice: it sublimates straight into a gas instead of melting. To get liquid carbon, we have to add one more factor: pressure.\n\nAccording to the diagram here:\nhttps://chemistry.stackexchange.com/questions/6068/what-is-known-about-liquid-carbon\n\nThere is a combination of temperatures and pressures capable of creating liquid carbon. This occurs above approx. 5000K, and 3 kBar (about 43000 PSI). As a comparison, tungsten melts at very near this combination, so you'd be long in search of an appropriate container for this reaction.\n\nTl;dr: Yes, heating wood in an oxygen free environment to ~5000K, 3kBar pressure will lead to liquid carbon.",

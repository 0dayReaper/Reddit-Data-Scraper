    "postText": "I've seen a lot of sources claim that all life on earth is descended from a single common ancestor, but others claim that the genesis of life is a simple chemical reaction that can occur easily, and that it had happened many times. Is there any evidence one way or the other, or are there factors that would make subsequent life less likely to compete, such as chirality or choice of base pairs? Is it possible that life has emerged more than once and then interbred to the point we can no longer distinguish, or is that hypothesis implausible?",

            "comment": "There is no reason to think that life didn't emerge multiple times on early Earth, but there is also no reason to think that it did. There's no evidence either way. One thing that is for sure is that all life on Earth *today* arose from a single lineage or organism (called LUCA, the Last Universal Common Ancestor), because of the unity of, yes, the universal chirality of biomolecules but also the shared genetic code and probably a few other things I can't think of off the top of my head. Since all modern life originated from a single ancestor, you can say that there's a veil of sorts that obscures history further back than LUCA. The database for the study of ancient life is the genomes we have at hand, and all of them are descendants of LUCA. But that doesn't mean there weren't other life forms before (or even after, I suppose) LUCA, but if there were they died out and left no evidence of their existence. There is simply no way to know what forms of life existed without genetic evidence that they existed.\n\nTo the best of my knowledge there is no particular advantage to D- versus L-chirality or the arrangement of genetic coding we have today. It is simply the way things formed -- evolution does not optimize that way.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind about origin of life research is that no one really knows that much. Researchers have pet hypotheses but they always reflect their own personal experiences and interests. For example, it's not that surprising that the inventor of the RNA World hypothesis -- a popular idea that suggests that RNA, a more chemically active cousin of DNA, was the first \"living\" biomolecule -- was Alex Rich, a lifelong RNA researcher. Its current biggest proponent is Jack Szostak, a guy who also spent most of his life studying RNA (and in part won a Nobel Prize for it). My experience is more in protein research and so I find hypotheses that incorporate proteins in the origin of life more compelling.",

When we make statements like \"life on earth is three billion years old\" is that because we've done statistics on the tree of life to figure out how far back it diverged, or could LUCA have lived much later, like one billion years ago?",

The first signs of life date back about 3.95 billion years and as far as I understand it are signs of *cellular* life, which I would expect to be a complex enough structure that it's on the LUCA lineage. But truthfully I don't really know. I guess it's possible that these other hypothetical lineages could have gotten as far as building cells before dying out, but there's no evidence of that and if someone found evidence of it, it would be the craziest scientific discovery maybe ever.\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, looking at some papers on the subject it seems like people expect LUCA to have lived in a ~200 million year window around that 3.95 billion year period. \n\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1007518",

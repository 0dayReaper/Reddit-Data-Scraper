But, that's for specific experiences, not general concepts so doing something again won't erase when you did it  before.",

With that said, your new memories won't overwrite the old ones - our storage doesn't appear to be that limited as we have with solid state circuits, tape and such.   However, your concern that your new memories might color the old ones - sure, that's likely.   But how do you know you are recalling the old memories accurately?",

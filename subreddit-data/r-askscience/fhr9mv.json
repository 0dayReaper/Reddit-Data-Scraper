The 2019-2020 season (which is when COVID-19 appeared) was tiny, maxing out at around 24 cases per reporting site ('sentinel') in around November/December 2019. The big peak was the *previous* season (2018-2019), a year before the coronavirus, during which it reached 65 people/site in early January 2019.\n\nThe end-of-the-year dip is at New Years, but I'm not positive why that is. My personal *guess* is that it's simply a matter of there being far, far fewer doctor's offices open over the New Years holidays, causing a dip from only people with really bad cases going in for testing, followed by a spike once all the doctor's offices open again and people who had milder symptoms and go in for testing. I went in to get a flu test on December 31st (what a way to ring in the new year!), and it was a pain in the butt finding an open doctor's office.",

They didn't test him for anything when he came in with fever, coughing, and shortness of breath,  just said it is the flu. The doctor claimed his shortness of breath is from him having mild asthma. Now that may be true, but without testing how could he know? I'm waiting to hear back if they can fit me in for testing tomorrow or Sunday.",

If you do not have symptoms, it is possible you might test and get a false-negative because the virus has not yet spread to the blood stream.

            "comment": "The common cold is actually a collection of over 200 different viruses that cause similar and typically minor symptoms. It's a pretty significant undertaking to try to develop vaccinations against all of them, and their eventual genetic divergences.\n\nIt's not that difficult to cherry-pick a specific virus out of the pile and develop a vaccine against that one, unless the virus mutates rapidly.\n\nIf you'd like to read more about the common cold, [here](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/understanding-common-cold-virus) is some further reading.\n\nEdit:\n\nI'm getting a lot of similar questions. Instead of answering them individually, I'll answer the more common ones here.\n\n**Q: 200? I thought there were only 3 or 4 viruses that cause colds?** A: Rhinoviruses, Coronaviruses, Paramyxoviruses are the families of viruses that make up the vast majority of colds, about 70%-80%. It's key to understand that these are families of viruses, not individual viruses. [Around 160](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinovirus) of those 200 are Rhinoviruses.\n\n**Q: Does influenza cause colds?** A: No, we call that *the flu*.\n\n**Q: Can bacteria cause a cold?** A: No, not really. [Rarely](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC104573/), a bacterial infection will be called a cold from the symptoms produced.\n\n**Q: Does this mean I can only catch 200 colds?** No. Not all immunizations last forever. See [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27158/) paper on the subject if you'd like to know more. /u/PM_THAT_EMPATHY outlined some details that my generalization didn't cover in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fq1rkq/if_the_common_cold_is_a_type_of_coronavirus_and/flqfiue) comment.\n\n**Q: Does SARS-COV-2 mutate rapidly?** A: It mutates relatively slowly. See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fq1rkq/if_the_common_cold_is_a_type_of_coronavirus_and/flqpxr3) comment by /u/cappnplanet for more information.\n\n**Q: Will social distancing eliminate this or other viruses?** A: Social distancing is about slowing the spread so that the medical systems are not overwhelmed. It will not eliminate viruses, but it does seem to be [slowing other diseases](https://qz.com/1824020/social-distancing-slowing-not-only-covid-19-but-other-diseases-too/) as well.\n\n/u/Bbrhuft pointed out an interesting caveat that may provide a challenge in developing a vaccination. Their [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/fq1rkq/if_the_common_cold_is_a_type_of_coronavirus_and/flu016h) is worth reviewing.",

There's no real advantage over getting a normal DTaP + Hib + polio shot combo, it's just that it only takes one shot instead of 2-3. And you still need boosters. \n\nYou got the same vaccines as people who had a Pentacel shot and you got them done at the same time, you just had them done in a different arrangement.",

My son got his boosters last year (he's 6) and got some version of Pentacel (they didn't call it that but that may have been what it was) so he only got two shots instead of the normal 3 or 4. He did have slight swelling and redness but he normally reacts that way to those vaccines seperately so it was doubly nice that we only had one spot to watch last time. It did swell more than usual though!",

You probably got Quadracel or Kinrix at 4 which have just the DTaP + Polio since you don\u2019t need the extra HIb or HepBs.  The combos are really nice for decreasing the sticks we have to do to kids though for sure",

My understanding is they pick like 4 strands that they think may be prevalent, but its not always effective. Surely if they pick 10 strands our odds of immunization would be higher than with 4 strands, maybe there are diminishing returns?.",

You can only put so much antigen in a delivery vehicle before it cannot hold anymore and the protein crashes out. On top of this, the dosing of each antigen must be high enough to actually have an effect.\n\nAs to a universal flu vaccine, there are actually many different projects ongoing to address this and they all go about it in slightly different ways. For some of these, there is actually quite a bit of evidence backing them up, so I wouldn't say they are entirely hypothetical at all. Many of these universal vaccines work to target a different section of the surface of flu particles which are far less likely to mutate, so they are better targets than the ones we traditionally use.\n\nThink of it as a lollipop: the head of a lollipop changes flavors frequently, but there is always a stick at the bottom and not much variation there. If the flu particle were covered in lollipops, we currently target the candy portion, but since they mutate frequently, it's hard to always pick the right antigen. If we target the stick, it will be harder to hit, but it's less likely to change.",

There is a principal called \"Original Antigenic Sin\" where an initial infection creates memory B cells that make antibodies to the original virus.  When a similar virus comes along that the memory B cells from the first infection can recognize, even if just barely, it inhibits the production of new B cells that are a better match for the new virus and response to the second virus isn't as good.  If you flood the body with dozens of new antigens at the same time, the subsequent responses will be weaker as a result.",

You have a good start to understanding the approach, so I'd like to add a little bit more background to what is generally being tried without diving into the jargon.\n\nYou can think of the surface of a flu particle as being covered in lollipops with the sticks stuck in the surface and the candy part presented on the outside. Our vaccines have traditionally targeted these candy heads because they are on the surface and thus, easier to target.\n\nThe problem with targeting the candy part is that candy manufacturers (viruses) create so many different flavors as time goes on, that it's hard to specifically target one flavor...they're always changing. Influenza replicates an ASTOUNDING amount per cell it infects and this results in an EPIC CRAP-TON of mutations just from the replication process having errors (Bob accidentally poured raspberry flavor into the blue dyed candy instead of blueberry.) In addition to this, there are \"mystery flavors\" where two viruses meet in a cell, do the virus-with-two-backs, swap notes, and recombine to form new, novel flavors. This is also how viruses gain the ability to infect new animal species.\n\nSo even though the candy flavor (surface composition of the virus) changes frequently, one common factor all lollipops have is the stick. It can vary, but they are all basically the same and haven't changed much over the years. The same is true with influenza because there is no evolutionary pressure to help drive massive changes to the stick, while there is a ton of pressure for the candy part, because people (immune systems) pay attention to the candy, not the stick.\n\nResearchers are trying to target the stick portion in a vaccine because there are more similarities between strains and far less mutations occuring in these regions. There are a bunch of different approaches being used right now, but that's the main, general idea for a universal flu vaccine.",

If virus A can infect 2 people before the host gets better, and virus B can infect 4 people before killing the host, B has the advantage there.\n\nThe other thing is that this is still a new virus.  As it's thought that Covid19 is a virus crossed over to us from animals, this virus has not yet been optimized for humans, and it's possible that a less deadly version will emerge and then out-compete the more deadly version for the reasons you said.  This is one theory for what happened to swine flu 10 years ago.",

Since it was an Innate Response, people's immunity wained after a few months to a year. One of the candidate vaccines for SARS-COV-1 that attempted to train Adaptive Immune System to identify the virus, caused a lethal Th2 response, most of the lab animals died from severe lung damage. There is no vaccine for SARS-CoV-1 after nearly 20 years of research (though interest also wained).\n\nAs for SARS-CoV-2, we are not certain if it stimulates long term immunity via the Adaptive Immune System (there's recent animal experiments in monkeys that indicates it provokes the Adaptive Immune System, that's encouraging). \n\nPeople who recovered from MERS-CoV appear to have long term immunity from it. \n\nSo creating a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 will be challenging, specifically if the virus only stimulates the Innate Immune system, where our immune system quickly forgets the antigen.\n\nRef.:\n\nhttp://www.biology.arizona.edu/immunology/tutorials/immunology/page3.html\n\nDr. Gregory Poland of the Mayo Clinic:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/oOgFYh7Ywo4",

So this means the virus mutates on an average of ~1 nucleotide/week (multiply substitution rate by genome size and divide by 52 weeks in a year). There is an average of 4-10 nucleotide dissimilarity when comparing viral genomes from Wuhan, China to NYC. Based on this, for COVID19 to mutate sufficiently to change mutagenicity of major surface proteins is exceedingly unlikely in the time frame of a few years.\n\nThis means that developing a vaccine is technically feasible with our currently technology (the methodology to rapidly develop a vaccination entails making mRNA vaccine). This does not preclude a \"second wave\" occurring from infection of people not previously infected and who are currently in areas that have not been hard hit yet by the virus before herd immunity is reached either by recovery from infection or sufficient vaccination.\n\nEdit: Should also add, based on the mutation rate, it's unlikely for someone previously infected to become re-infected with the COVID19 again within the timeframe of a few years. Serology (blood antibody) tests are being developed to identify patients who have been infected and recovered to the point we can definitely say they are immune.\"",

The word \"successful\" isn't really a word that viruses understand because they're not living and they don't have motivations we can ascribe to them. But viruses like HSV-1/2 (Herpes) are two of the most \"successful\" viruses to humans because they really don't kill the person, rarely tell you they're there, spread really easily, and they stay around for a while. \n\nViruses like Ebola are not super great* because they burn through their hosts way too fast. \n\nAll that being said, this virus is pretty effective at keeping itself replicating. It spares 80%+ of people from anything but mild symptoms and spares another 5+% from death. It has a long, silent incubation time, and apparently, stays around in the body for a good long time post-recovery.\n\n\\*as u/arand0md00d mentioned, not super great *in humans*. Really important point of clarity that I should have made clear.",

Virulence is an adaptive characteristic. In some circumstances, it's more advantageous to be highly virulent and deadly, in others it's a disadvantage. \n\nTo quote from Claude Combes' \"Parasitism\" (which, while not directly dealing with viruses, is a fantastic read on the coevolution of a disease and its host), \n\n\"In short, it is recognized today that certain parasite-host associations may evolve towards a more peaceful coexistence whereas others may evolve towards stronger virulence or even pass through high and low virulence phases\".",

Imagine two polar opposite scenarios, let's say a super dense concentration camp and a tribal society where small villages live several miles apart. In the concentration camp scenario, an incredibly virulent plague that incapacitates and kills rapidly might have an evolutionary advantage, if it also spreads more effectively.  The victims are all in close proximity. Better spreading doesn't help that much in the tribal villages scenario, in contrast. There you want to optimize for mild symptoms and a long period of contagiousness, so you have time and ability to spread to neighboring villages. A virulent plague won't jump to adjacent villages well because people will be too sick to make the trip.\n\nSo if human society exceeds certain density thresholds, a super lethal virus can spread very effectively. HIV is one example. It's a poor spreader, but has an extremely long latency that gives it time to spread. Smallpox is incredibly lethal, but also highly contagious and was quite successful in human populations before vaccination was invented. Measles had very high historical mortality, but spreads great in humans. It's a bit of a fallacy that spread and mortality are mutually exclusive.",

That may be a result of failing to keep track of everyone who has it. I also believe they've had a couple of outbreaks at nursing homes; such outbreaks can very easily push up the death rate in countries where the virus has had less of an impact.\n\nThe cultural differences you point to would lead theoretically lead to lower contagiousness, but not a lower fatality rate. Although in practice, they might make it easier to keep track of cases (leading to a lower *apparent* fatality rate) and also reduce strain on the health system (which can obviously lead to more deaths, both from the virus itself and from other things).",

            "comment": "From a public health perspective, there are certain principles that are critical to justifying an immunisation program, which are roughly these:\n\n\n\n- the germ needs to be common, easily spread;\n\n- the germ needs to pose significant public threat;\n\n- the vaccine needs to be sufficiently efficacious; \n\n- And overall: the benefits of the vaccine need to outweigh the costs, to the individual AND the community (monetary, side effects etc).\n\n\n\nA justifiable vaccination program doesn't have to meet ALL of these criteria perfectly, but it does have to meet them to some degree. \n\n\n\nRabies for example: relatively rare, but a huge threat to anyone who contracts it. Very efficacious vaccine if used correctly. The vaccine has side effects and may be costly, but it is of great benefit to the individual to avoid contracting the disease, and to the community to limit the incidence, and healthcare costs associated with managing the condition. \n\n\n\nInfluenza: common, very easily spread. Causes significant mortality in certain vulnerable groups. The vaccine is typically not as efficacious as most others due to seasonal mutations and strains, but even if it does not prevent the flu it may reduce the severity. The vaccine is relatively cheap, and is well tolerated with few side effects.\n\n\n\nNow, the common cold (which as others have said is not just one bug): very common, very easily spread. Mortality and morbidity? Most measured in productive time lost at a cost to individuals and society. Not a significant threat, rarely causes death even in vulnerable populations. Would a vaccine be efficacious? Well, there's so many bugs causing the cold and they change so often, it's very unlikely we could develop an effective vaccine. Risk vs Benefit? You might have noticed some people get a few cold-like symptoms after the flu vaccine - if the equivalent vaccine were to cause these or other side effects, the risk equals the benefit. Not to mention the cost associated with developing a vaccine each year to keep up with changing cold bugs.\n\n\n\nCOVID-19: Increasingly common. Very easily spread. Significant mortality in older people, and significant morbidity in other groups as well. This virus also has a huge cost to society - healthcare costs are astronomical, people are losing their jobs, the economy is going to be significantly affected. The efficacy, side effects and cost of any vaccine are yet to be determined. \n\n\n\nIn summary, as much as everyone would like not to experience colds 3-4 times a year, a vaccine against the common cold is not justifiable. A vaccine against COVID-19 is justifiable.\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the silver!",

This is also why a cure for the herpes virus is not a top priority, even though everyone who carries herpes in any form would be very happy to be rid of it.\n\nThe economics of the problem are a huge factor, not the least consideration of which is how many products would disappear from the economy if certain things were eliminated. Vaccination research is prioritized, in terms of funding allocation, by their profit:loss ratio.\n\nCancer is very, very costly. So is heart disease. Not only is it expensive to treat, it almost randomly pulls workers out of businesses and, therefore, profitable production. People work throughout the common cold, and with herpes, and the cost of allowing it to survive is not only negligible, but profitable in all the remedies created. Homeopathic \u201cremedies\u201d are probably the most profitable in existence, since they literally do nothing and are literally just water. But it\u2019s a profitable market, so it exists, and thrives. Placebos are a huge profit industry in countries with universal healthcare for this reason. \n\nThe coronavirus has ground the economy to a virtual standstill.

Some we can treat very well and others we can\u2019t. But we call it all cancer in lay language. \n\nThe common cold is the same. It\u2019s just the constellation of symptomatic manifestation that many different and unique viruses have. Rhinovirus for example is one of the most common causes of what manifests to us as the common cold. Vaccination is impossible because of so much antigenic variability and very high rate of mutation, so if we can treat one, the treatment is obsolete immediately because of mutation. \n\nCoronavirus is one other manifestation of the common cold that doesn\u2019t mutate much at all. So it can be targeted effectively. There just hasn\u2019t been much need to prior to this strain mutating to jump into humans. Imagine a manifestation of a virus like Ebola but with the mutation rate of rhinovirus? Scary shit. \n\nSo, covid19 is a coronavirus that mutated to become unique, it was unexpected entirely and spread around the world. Thus we call it a pandemic. There\u2019s a big difference in words like epidemic and pandemic, so it\u2019s important to use them correctly. But that\u2019s a tangent. Treatment is for covid19 is a matter of time because it\u2019s a relatively stable virus. The US strain is different than the European strain, but it\u2019s not a meaningful difference for a targeted medicine perspective.",

The reason there is no vaccine is because there are just too many different cold viruses out there and they are constantly mutating to create new ones. Also they aren't very hazardous, I don't know the figures but the common cold has a very low death rate. These three aspects combined juts mean it's not worth trying. Probably would be too expensive also.",

However, due to the high risk of mutation one year to another it's hard to predict what will be the epidemic strain. Guesses and data analysis from regions that are impacted before us help to determined the best selection of viral strains. Sometimes, the estimations and guesses are wrong, that's why the vaccine of a year doesn't work that much. \n\n\nAs implied, it's not a cure. It is cause by the frequent mutations. You can get immunized to a certain strain for a certain period but it won't protect you for the next year. Moreover, your build immunity is not going to last that long. Hence the necessity to have multiple shots for certain diseases that are always the same strains.\n\n\nAbout SARS - COV2, I didn't search why infectiologist have high hopes to find a vaccine. I think It's highly likely due to the unique strain responsible for the disease (cov19)",

It's actually an assortment of 200+ endemic rhino viruses, and influenzas, some of which mutate enough each year to become re-infectious among the general population. It's not like the vaccine for the flu season cures an illness anyways, it's just supposed to prevent you from getting sick with the real disease later if you encounter it",

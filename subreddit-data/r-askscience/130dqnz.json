    "postText": "I was reading on GR receptor, if the receptor becomes downregulated and the negative feedback loop becomes less efficient, more cortisol would be secreted and the person would have high levels of cortisol but less binding to GR receptor.\n\nIn this case, would the person experience more stress or less stress? Does cortisol need to bind to GR receptor to mediate its stress response?",

            "comment": "The cortisol response is not stress itself and it is misleading to think of cortisol purely as a stress hormone. \n\nCortisol is a feed-forward metabolic hormone (useful to increase blood sugar levels in the morning for example), and there is a clear daily cycle. But cortisol is important and will still be expressed regardless of perceived psychological stress. Cortisol levels are influenced by daily activity patterns and can be increased by psychological stress, since this leads to increased anticipation of activity levels. \n\nSome cells may downregulate GR expression to maintain normal homeostasis if exposed to chronically elevated cortisol levels, but this will go back to normal in time if cortisol levels go back to normal.\n\nAs you might have guessed, from cortisol being a metabolic hormone, other factors such as changes in body fat levels or aging, use of drugs such as caffeine or nicotine can also influence levels over time due to feedback loops.",

They will try to maintain a degree of homeostasis. But there are limits to which they adapt to alterations in endocrine signalling (both extracellular receptors and the downstream signalling cascades).",

    "postText": "I believe there is a quality benefit in that I'm told that cooking many foods makes them easier to digest (how much easier?) and I'm aware that it is safer, meat in particular, to subject foods to enough heat to kill harmful bacteria. \n\nWhat I'm interested in is whether there is a nutritional benefit. It seems plausible that cooking could actually harm nutrients, but is there a nutritional benefit that makes up for this?\n\nFollow-up if nutrtion profile does not change: If I have the nutritional data for a food by weight, and I cook the food, it will have less weight. Will the resulting food have the same nutrition as the uncooked food I start with (is the weight loss only water?)\n\nI started thinking about this while being pitched a raw food diet for my dog. The premise doesn't make sense to me for the same reason that dog owners who feed their dogs raw meet likely aren't eating raw meat themselves, but the claim is that it has a health benefit for the dog and I have no knowledge of that but am thinking that if it does, surely it would apply to humans as well.\n\nApologies if I have the wrong flair or have asked in the wrong forum. Seems like a biology question fundamentally.",

Frontal lobe development in our early human ancestors matches up nicely with evidence of our beginning to wield flame for cooking. \n\nCooking increases the nutrient concentration of food by dehydration, or rehydration with the broth and liquids of other foods as they cook. It breaks down proteins in ways chewing and acidic stomachs couldn\u2019t as efficiently, allowing our GI tracts to shorten over time as we gave them less hard work to do. Vegetable fibers are either solubilized or broken down into smaller more manageable molecular pieces, many of which are the very favorite food of any healthy gut flora. Some raw (and common!) foods are toxic in the raw state, yet perfectly edible when cooked. It offers sterilization of food, too, which is a massive survival advantage.\n\nThere are, of course, some heat sensitive nutrients which are impacted by cooking, which shouldn\u2019t discourage us from cooking; rather, we should simply enjoy some foods raw and some cooked!\n\nOn dogs: about 750,000 thousand years separate the advent of human cooking and the domestication of dogs. Dogs have spent, evolutionarily speaking, much less time with altered diets including cooked food, so they capacity to handle food in its raw state remains greater than ours. Their bodies are more recently equipped to handle raw food, and haven\u2019t for as long had selective pressures to adjust to/benefit from/change in response to cooking.",

My engineer brain wants to come away with a formula I could apply to cooking a steak in order to quantify the benefit of cooking in a perfect scenario.",

It may very well be that you could with the right equipment and to a useful extent, develop some math around this. I\u2019m sure others have!\n\nFor me, I\u2019ve noticed the higher the volume of raw fruits and veggies I eat, the fitter I am, regardless of calories consumed.

It takes more energy from the body to process most raw meats than cooked meat.  And our teeth aren't adapted for raw meat.\n\nSo I think it would be a net negative to try to go back to this.",

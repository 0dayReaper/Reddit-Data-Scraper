            "comment": "Some urinary crystals/stones can be dissolved but some can\u2019t, so even in cats there are occasionally individuals who require surgery to remove them instead of relying on changes to diet. However, as someone with multiple human family members who have kidney stones, you CAN prevent some types with healthy diet and with adequate water intake to keep everything diluted. But it\u2019s a lot easier to control what an indoor pet eats (especially since most people just give them one thing for all meals) than it is to get adult human beings to change the way they eat, how much soda they drink, etc. If we just ate nothing but bowl after bowl of the same kibble every day, it would be pretty easy to prevent the most common types of stones in humans as well!\n\nSome laypersons articles from reliable sources:\n\nhttps://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2017/07/dietary-treatment-of-bladder-stones/\n\nhttps://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355759 (scroll down to the prevention/lifestyle changes section\u2014 this is basically what we are doing for pets, and like them the exact plan will depend on which kind of stones are involved) \n\nAs for ultrasonic lithotripsy, it can be challenging and expensive to adapt human medical equipment for companion animals, but the vet world is working on it! https://profiles-vetmed.umn.edu/article/sonic-substitute-surgery",

            "comment": "If I was correctly paying attention to the vet. Our cays don't have kidney stones. They have basically salt crystals (probably not actually salt) that grow big enough they clog and damage the urethra, which then swells and takes more damage and can eventually fully block the urethra. The size of the tube is relative to the size of the animal, so it takes much smaller crystals to hurt a cat than a human.\n\nThe food for our cats is specifically formulated to help prevent the formation of these crystals in the first place. We combine that will watering down their food so they have to empty their bladder more often. So far so good.",

            "comment": "My understanding is that the disease some cats get is characterized by stony-looking crystals (uroliths or crystoliths or something else I can't remember right now) forming in their bladders. Some treatments involve stone-dissolving diets that typically lower the pH (acidify) the cat's urine, which dissolves some stones but not others, e.g., struvite stones can be dissolved by diets that lower urine pH, but calcium oxalate stones cannot. \n\nNote these form in the bladder, not the kidneys. \n\nHuman kidney stones tend to be, IIRC, more often calcium oxalate or phosphate. \n\nI have never heard of lithotripsy being used in a veterinary setting, but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. \n\nCheers!",

    "postText": "I've run into \"the Great Gulf\" in various sci-fi novels that take place on Orion-Cygnus Arm. From context, I believe it to be a section of the arm that is extremely low on stars, effectively dividing the arm into separate sections that have normal or high density of stars and other matter.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs the Great Gulf real? What is its proper name? What is the Great Gulf? If I correctly understood the context and the Great Gulf is indeed a region that is significantly lacking in stars and matter, how does the Orion-Cygnus Arm not \"fall apart\" at this structural \"weak point\"?",

            "comment": "Given the context, I think you may be conflating a couple of different things.  One is the \"Great Rift\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Rift_(astronomy)). This isn't actually a region of low density, but it appears to be because there are clouds of interstellar dust between us and the stars beyond the dust cloud that obscure them in the visible wavelengths. They're there, we just can't visually see them as well. These are stars within our galaxy. The other are the so-called [great] voids (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Void_(astronomy)). These are, indeed, regions where there genuinely is a much lower density of stars and other celestial objects, but they're much larger than galaxies or arms of galaxies.\n\nIn general, though, gravitationally bound systems like galaxies aren't rigid structures. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to talk about structural weakness because of gaps.",

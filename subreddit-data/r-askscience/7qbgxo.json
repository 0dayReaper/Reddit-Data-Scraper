The term for this is infantile \u201camnesia\u201d, but this is not actually a form of amnesia \u2014 that would require forgetting. As infants grow into toddlers, their brains grow fantastically quickly. So much so, that any pathways that are deemed unimportant/weak are \u201cpruned\u201d. Pruning is the technical term actually. By age three, pruning calms down to the point where toddlers can start forming the memories they\u2019ll remember for possibly the rest of their lives. However, usually the very earliest memories are traumatic or notable in some way. Pruning continues for some time into childhood. Maybe age 4. \n\nEdit: this has gotten more traction than I anticipated, and I have to clarify: when I say \u201cwe don\u2019t form memories in the first place\u201d what I\u2019m saying is that we form memories that we will NOT be able to RECALL after our brains grow and pruning occurs. Toddlers can remember things, but, as we\u2019ve all experienced, they forget an exceptional amount of their day-to-day experiences. As another user pointed out, toddlers actually are learning a metric ton of stuff (motor, language, etc.). \n\nEdit 2: another user pointed out that it is the delayed development of the hippocampus (learning/memory/encoding center) that contributes to infantile amnesia.

The level of science words we can use just depends on the previous knowledge of the person we're talking to. We should be able to explain a topic, then add labels if necessary afterwards. For example, the process of harvesting insulin from E. coli means we took the instructions for insulin production and put it into a bacteria, so now we just collect the product that is made. A layperson doesn't need to know that we cut DNA with restriction enzymes to isolate the gene for insulin, used a hybridization probe, PCR'd to amplify the gene, analyzed it, and inserted it into a plasmid for culture.\n\nSo try explaining a topic, then afterwards saying \"and that's called such and such\". \n\nAlso, an interesting phrasing term of mine. When trying to find out someone's familiarity with a topic, don't ask \"Do you know how nucleophilic reactions work?\" Instead try, \"Are you familiar with nucleophilic reactions?\" It's a softer approach that allows people to say yes, they're familiar with a topic but they don't have to know all of the details in order to feel like they belong in the conversation.",

As much as I still love the idea of counseling kids or teens, it would leave me too geographically locked, and being able to travel and move around is something I value way too much right now.

I also love the idea of working in/with multinational companies, and I hope to be living outside of the US by 2022. One career goal that gives me heart eyes is the idea of helping a company transition into becoming multinational.",

If you want some history on where the research started you could look at comparing the work of Jean Piaget and Erik Erikson and their ideas on stage development (development happens like a staircase), or Vygotsky, though I'm guessing you have seen those already if you are currently in a psych degree. A lot of the research overlaps with other theories in psychology since they are fairly similar.",

To add to this, episodic memories (the kind that recall events in one's life) are not usually far less important than procedural memories (e.g. knowing how to walk or talk) and semantic memories (e.g. remembering the faces of your parent(s)), so these are usually the first to be pruned (which happens mostly during sleep, one factor as to why babies sleep so much). However, pieces of these memory \"traces\" are hypothesized to sometimes remain intact (usually when high levels of emotion are involved), possibly explaining certain fears or biases that have no root in a person's memories. \n\nSorry for rambling; I have a degree in this stuff and I get excited talking about it.",

During the early growth phase, the brain goes into overdrive on the expansion aspect of Hebbian learning (synaptogenesis) - very little is required for a connection between neurons to form. This is one very strong area of research related to synesthesia and there's the possibility that synesthesia is very common at an early age. \n\nWhen synaptogenesis stops, all of these connections which aren't frequently used die off (pruning). It's a passive mechanism, and because synaptogenesis has created some crazy connections that generally aren't reinforced (hearing colors, seeing music), these connections aren't kept.\n\nWhile my degree is in cognitive neuroscience from one of the top schools in the field (West coast CogSci wooh!), the biggest point that was always made to students is that the majority of our current knowledge is closer to being hypotheses than theory. We will learn a lot more in the next few years and decades and this information will likely throw some of what we do know out the window.\n\nAs to the link to symbolic skills, as far as I'm aware, this is not a prerequisite to memory - I would imagine memory in animals is a good starting point on a contradiction argument.\n\nEdit: I was lazy and careless in writing this. /u/Dagl1 does an excellent job explaining what I was aiming at.",

I think he means to say that the neurons prune those synapses that aren't used a lot (there are multiple models of pruning and several types, take this into account). There are whole cellular \"programs\" for axon retraction; the synapses don't just degrade because of no more maintenace, but the selection of synapses to be pruned seems to be primarily bases on the lack of activation.

I think the closest we can say to that is that we don\u2019t have enough evidence to reach a conclusion. In the past decade there has been plenty of evidence that synapses are tagged for removal by microglial cells, and that synapses with appropriate activity that should be maintained (here\u2019s where the Hebbian \u201ccells that fire together, wire together\u201d concept comes in) are similarly tagged with \u201cdon\u2019t eat me\u201d signals. I personally would not consider complement-mediated synaptic pruning to be a passive process, I think that the idea of pruning or synapse elimination to be passive is outdated. I\u2019m open to hearing explanations to the contrary though! Certainly different methods for synapse elimination may exist. Also not quite sure where you\u2019re going with axon retraction; most of the synaptic pruning research I\u2019ve read refers to dendritic spines. ",

Infants easily form other types of memories, including procedural memory (eg learning to walk), and semantic memory (learning what things are).  Infantile amnesia is limited to autobiographical memories.  There are lots of ideas as to why this is.  One is a lack of self awareness - the child hasn't yet learned that they are an individual and that there are other individuals.  The second is language development.  Autobiographical memory is often descriptive, eg. \"I went to the store \".  Encoding this memory may rely on language skills that have not yet developed.  These are all related to the underlying neurophysiological development.",

The article has no definitive answer but covers what appear to be reasonable theories such as the brain isn't \"recording\" episodic memories or *can't* record them yet due to a still-growing hippocampus.\nhttp://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160726-the-mystery-of-why-you-cant-remember-being-a-baby\n\nThis article is more focused on the explanation being proposed that the brain is still developing neurons in the region where memories are formed. \nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-can-t-you-remember-being-a-baby/\n\nI am absolutely not an expert in this field but I've read enough to know that memories are the connections between neurons in specific parts of the brain. There is also an element of flexibility, called [plasticity](https://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/brain-plasticity/what-is-brain-plasticityhttps://www.brainhq.com/brain-resources/brain-plasticity/what-is-brain-plasticity), in the brain that defines how easily connections are made or broken. \n\nWhen we are very young the brain is very flexible, we have a lot to learn. Connections are made and broken quickly. \n\nIt would seem plausible that driving force for not being able to recall specific memories while the brain is still adding neurons to the memory-related parts of the brain(the bbc article mentions this) and while the brain is still extraordinarily flexible, those connections that make memories may not last very long. New neurons would disrupt those networks of connections and new memories could be making use of connections involved in other memories until there isn't enough left of a given episode's network to recall the memory. \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if culture played into that as well, if you try to hold onto a memory your attempt to access it can strengthen the connections to the episode over time and make it harder to forget(no idea if that affects accuracy of the memory). If no one in your culture gives a shit about a specific type of memory why bother trying to recall it? \n\nI know just enough about this stuff to get myself into trouble so check the sources and don't quote me on jack shit.",

Memories are being recorded again at very early ages, but the issue with this system is that the catalogue and recall system hasn't developed until around 3 years, so there isn't a way to recall memories beyond that point.\n\nThe difference in these 2 systems can be very distinctly seen when memories of a traumatic event fade or are blocked from the mind, but the pattern recognition still causes anxiety when faced with a similar situation\n\nSubconscious pattern recognition is also much faster than cognitive thought, consisting of learned knowledge and truths, such as being able to recall that fire is hot and not to touch it or phobias, the event where we learned it doesn't need to be recalled for the situation to be assessed very quickly by instinct built over our lifetime",

In early childhood, pruning happens when specialized immune cells in the brain actively go around \"eating up\" tons of connections, which results in massive cell death.

You're born with far more total neurons and connections than you have as an adult, or even an adolescent. Forgetting something as an adult is different- it usually doesn't mean cells are dying (except in diseases), but rather that the relative strength of the connections that form that memory has declined.",

As you've pointed out in your question, some people seem to recall very early childhood memories, for example how their infant mobiles looked like. As many different studies have shown (i.e. Julia Shaw's book \"the memory illusion\" is a good read on this) people may actually belief to remember things that other people have told them. When, for example, their parents told them stories about them as a toddler and they think about these multiple times when telling others, it might happen that they actually think they remember these facts from them being a baby and not from their parent's stories.     \nOur memories are sometimes way more fallible than most of us think.",

I think the development of language and formation of hippocampal structures and white matter tracts play a role.   \n\nIn addition, there's a cognitive reason that people only remember things after a certain age. Another way to look at it is the development of the sense of self.  If you understand memory formation (explicit memories that is), it is tied to various things like emotional valence, personal relevance, etc.  This helps form autobiographical memories. One theory is that there's a shift in memory when a child develops a sense of self where there is a personalization of memories.  \n\nsome references: \nhttps://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4615-9364-5_7\n\nhttps://books.google.com/books?id=w1YrFypvmn8C&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=Development+of+Higher+Brain+Functions:+Birth+Through+Adolescence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J0mUh1YEFR&amp;sig=R27kae-gbp0g_QEKSfOH13Ve34E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimye78pNjYAhVfHGMKHYB9CF4Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Development%20of%20Higher%20Brain%20Functions%3A%20Birth%20Through%20Adolescence&amp;f=false\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mary_Courage/publication/278857485_The_emergence_and_early_development_of_autobiographical_memory/links/55c9dda008aebc967dfa3c74.pdf\n\n\ndisclaimer; clinical neuropsychologist here.",

Being a psychology minor I took Psychology of childhood and infancy last semester and was fascinated when I learned the answer to this question. This is commonly referred to as childhood amnesia and the reason this occurs has everything to do with both language and memory. In short children need to form memories to remember correct? But how do we form memories? By language! If you cannot understand the language fully yet than it is very difficult to develop long term memories. Children between the ages of 1-3 can form short term memories of course but not long term. For most people the language skills don't fully develop until ages 4-5 which is when you begin creating long term memories and why you can remember events from when you were 4 or 5 but not necessarily when you were 3 or younger.

In fact, newborn's sensory cortex isn't fully developed, so all of their senses blur together - music has color and a taste, for example - called synesthesia.

Unlike now, we learn a language with translations and synonyms. I wouldn't say that the storage space is less but I'd say a developing brain wouldn't multitask. ( read and store at the same time )\n\nIt doesn't mean we don't remember anything from that age, emotional memories like pain can be recalled often.\n\nMemory is not actually you remembering an event. It's the recalling act in which you recall the \"last time\" you recalled that memory. ",

However, the part of the brain that keeps track of where those memories are stored isn't fully developed before age 4.  The memories are there, but you just can't access them.  It's like having a library that has lots of books but hasn't catalogued them so it's impossible for the librarians to find any particular book.",

The hypothesis is that memories are formed during neurogenesis, and that the rate of neurogenesis governs the rate of forgetting - and thus produces infant amnesia.  \n  \nHe published a paper on this in Science a few years ago.  \nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/344/6184/598  \n",

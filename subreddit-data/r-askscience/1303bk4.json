    "postText": "Hello,\n\nI was curious about Antiviral medications.  For instance, there is an antiviral available for HIV now,  ART.  There are also Antivirals for things like Herpes Simplex 1; Acyclovir and others.\n\nAntibiotics, to my understanding, are essentially a nuke.  They kill everything in the infected region.  We don't have that technique available to us for Viruses, though.  \n\nSo, I was curious - what are the traits of these Antivirals and what mechanisms do they have that result in successful treatment?  \n\nAre Antivirals creating an environment that is prohibitive towards the Host's virus in their system, causing them to not duplicate or fail to do so?\n\nAnd one more on the same topic - Are they basically the same medication, but just used in different quantities?  For instance, would ART also treat Herpes Simplex 1, Simplex 2, etc?  \n\nOr are they entirely different in their form and function to treat other viruses?\n\nThank you for your time",

            "comment": "HIV medications are quite unique! They are called anti-retrovirus medications and combinations of multiple are used in anti-retro viral therapy (ART) in the prevention and treatment of HIV. HIV attacks your cells by changing its RNA into DNA then inserting it into your cells. Anti-retrovirals inhibit key pieces of the process of the reverse transcription from RNA to DNA as well as integration into the DNA. By targeting enzymes that are unique to the virus lifecycle, you kill the virus without harming your own cells. These medications are so good that, if taken regularly, reduce the viral load of HIV to zero and prevent transmission as well. While ART can\u2019t cure HIV, it\u2019s possible to eradicate it by preventing the spread. Access to these medications is a very important public health issue around the world.",

            "comment": "Antibiotics don't \"nuke everything\", but you are correct in that they are much more indiscriminate in what they \"kill\" than antivirals are.  One reason for this is the relative complexity of bacteria compared to viruses. Bacterial genomes are far larger, and code for far more proteins than viruses do.  Add to this the fact that bacteria are alive and able to replicate on their own, while viruses rely in large part on the machinery of the infected cells to make more viruses.\n\nFor example, tetracycline in a broad spectrum (meaning effective against many different types of bacteria) which stops bacterial protein production by irreversibly binding to bacterial ribosomes (the part of any cell responsible for making new protein).  However, bacterial ribosomes are different enough from human ribosomes that your cells happily keep making protein, while the bacteria can't and die.   Nearly all bacteria have the same ribosomal structure so it works well against a lot of different bacterial species.\n\nHowever, viruses don't have ribosomes.  They infect your cells and use your ribosomes to make their protein.  An antiviral which stops viral protein synthesis in the same way as tetracycline stops bacterial protein synthesis (by binding to and blocking the means of production) would assuredly kill the virus, but you would be dead also as your body would be unable to make new proteins.\n\nInstead, many antivirals are designed to target a specific virus.  I'll use your herpes/acyclovir example above.  Acyclovir acts by inhibiting DNA synthesis and is a type of molecule known as a nucleoside analog.  That means it looks sort of like a molecule which is used in DNA synthesis, but has important parts missing.  The enzymes humans use to synthesize DNA are sophisticated enough to realize that acyclovir is a \"fake\" and doesn't use it in DNA synthesis.  However, herpesviruses have their own version of this enzyme that doesn't realize acyclovir is a fake and happily utilize it to make new DNA.  However, acyclovir is missing a part of the molecule that is required to add the next base in the chain, and therefore DNA synthesis stops.  Yes, this can affect the infected cell also, but it is infected with a virus and is doomed anyway.\n\nFun fact-there are 8 distinct human herpesviruses, and as far as I know acyclovir works against most if not all of them.\n\nBUT-because viruses evolved much differently than bacteria, other viruses use much different strategies than herpesvirues do to make new DNA, and therefore acyclovir (or any drug in \"cyclovir\" family) do not work on viruses outside of herpesviruses.\n\nThere are antivirals, such as interferon, which work by targeting your immune system rather than the virus directly.  These types of drugs serve to \"supercharge\" your immune system.  An increase in interferon is like an alarm on a military base.  It tells your immune cells there is a problem (infection) somewhere and they by God better muster up, make more immune cells, and spread out around the body and figure out what the problem is.",

It states that while, yes, tetracyclines bind to the 80s mammalian subunit, it does so with a much lower affinity, and the binding site in the 80s subunit is a little different so its impact on tRNA binding to ribosomes is less significant than with bacterial ribosomes.

                            "comment": "Acyclovir doesn't inhibit the polymerase enzyme.  The target enzyme here is thymidine kinase. Kinase enzymes are a broad class of enzymes which generally work by adding phosphate groups to other molecules.  There are A LOT of different kinase enzymes responsible for different processes within the body.\n\nThymidine kinase (TK) is responsible for taking thymidine (which is the \"T\" DNA base when you see DNA sequences represented as ATGC) and adds a phosphate group to it to make thymidine monophosphate. The monophosphate form is what is used by DNA polymerase when making new DNA.\n\nSo, your (human, mammal, probably any eukaryote) does not recognize acyclovir as a proper thymidine as acycoliver's chemical structure is similar but different from thymidine.  Herepesviruses have thier own TK gene which does recognize acyclovir (in addition to actual thymidine) and produces \"acyclovir monophosphate\" which is then recognized by DNA polymerase as thymidine monophosphate.  When acyclovir monophosphate gets incorporated into the DNA strand, it ends the strand as acyclovir is missing the part of the molecule where the next DNA base is attached.\n\nApologies for the misstatements on tetracycline.  This antibiotic binds to both prokaryotic (bacteria) ribosomal subunits 30s (small) and 50s (large) and also the 40s (small) subunit in eukaryotes (humans, animals, fungi, etc), but apparently not the 60s (large) subunit in eukaryotes.  In each case one small and one large subunits come together to act as a single ribosome.  The concentration issue was not something we learned about.  It is entirely possible that this is a newer finding considering I was learning about this in the late 1990s when I was in undergrad.  Tetracycline drugs have been around since the 1950s.  They had no idea how it worked back then probably, only that it did!\n\nEdit for typos",

But by that logic, why doesn't acyclovir inhibit lots of viral DNA polymerases the same way that tetracycline inhibits lots of bacterial ribosomes.\n\nBecause ribosomes are at least somewhat homologous between bacterial species. It's difficult to mutate &amp; change the binding site for tetracycline on the 30S subunit without affecting the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA. I'm sure that these mutations still happen in some resistant bacteria, but the main mechanisms of resistance to tetracyclines is through the production of efflux pumps, proteins that bind to the ribosomes &amp; enzymes that break down the drug. It is fair to call tetracyclines broad-spectrum. They're a quintessential example.\n\nThe reason why acyclovir doesn't inhibit DNA polymerase in other viruses is because herpes viruses have the unique ability to metabolise acyclovir into acyclovir-triphosphate (A-TP) at a rate that allows for it to bind DNA polymerase appreciably. Without the A-TP, acyclovir is as good as useless.",

            "comment": "Antibiotics don't nuke everything. Some can kill many types of bacteria, others are more specific to particular types. The antibiotic when taken internally is not localized to the infection site but goes everywhere (with the possible exception of the brain and certain other regions of the body). The concentration of the antibiotic in the body as a whole has to be high enough that at that local infection it is high enough to kill the bacteria. It does not zoom in on the spot of infection. The exception to this would be something like a topical antibiotic put on a cut, there it is localized to the site of the infection for example. Not that not all medicines used to treat bacterial kill the bacteria, some may just stop the growth while the body finishes the job. These would be bacteriostatic where antibiotics that kills are bactericidal. There are many different kinds of antibiotics that work in different ways. Some interfere with bacterial cell wall synthesis, some block bacterial protein production, some disrupt membranes and there are others. At the end of the day a bacteria is a living cell that has its own cellular components that allow it to grow. Many of those components have a similar function to a human counterpart, yet are still different. Humans have ribosomes that are different than bacterial ribosomes. This allows us to target the unique aspects of bacteria, while not affecting the human cellular counterpart. Some things like a bacterial cell well have no counterpart in the human body. So in principle having a substance that interferes with cell wall construction won't affect human cells as we do not have cell walls. \n\nViruses are different, they don't have their own living cell, they have to rely on the human cellular components to grow. How much it relies on human components varies a bit from completely relying on the human cell to some viruses like herpes which have some of their own proteins they make that serve in function of reproducing its DNA. But even then, without a human cell to infect, viruses can do nothing without infecting.\n\nThis creates a problem, if we target the human components involved in helping the virus grow, we hurt our own cells by doing so. So we have fewer things to target that are \"different\" compared to bacteria. What we can target will depend on the virus. HIV for example makes an enzyme called reverse transcriptase (RT) that turns its RNA genome into DNA as part of its lifecycle. If you block RT function you interfere with the virus life cycle such that the virus cannot establish a productive infection. Some of the first antivirals were RT inhibitors for HIV. So what were these? These were chemicals that looked a lot like a nucleotide (nucleoside analogs) that is necessary to make DNA except they had certain chemical differences that does not allow DNA synthesis to proceed thus blocking the process. The human enzymes that synthesize DNA are \"better\" at discriminating. The human enzymes \"look\" at that analogue and \"determines\" that that is not a nucleotide thus does not use it in DNA synthesis. RT in contrast is not as good at this. RT will take that analogue and incorporate it into the growing HIV genome. But I mentioned these analogues have special chemical properties. Should that analogue get incorporated into the growing HIV DNA genome, you cannot continue to make more DNA. Certain chemical parts are missing so DNA synthesis stops in the virus and cannot go further. Thus by interfering in HIV's lifecycle in such a way you have slowed (or ideally stopped) the virus ability to grow more, infect more cells, spread, and ultimately cause disease. Unfortunately these analogues don't work 100%, meaning some virus still grow but at a much lower level, so they slow down virus infection and disease onset, but don't stop it. HIV also develops resistance but that is another issue. Some other antivirals do a similar thing to other viruses in a roughly similar way, except you need to make an analogue to work specifically for the virus at hand. That also slows down antiviral development. For the most part antivirals are specific to the virus and can't be used as a broad spectrum antiviral like antibiotics do. There are other steps in the HIV life cycle we target. For example at the very end of the HIV lifecycle a viral particle is released from the infected cell but there is one more step. The is an enzyme called a \"protease\" that will clip some proteins in the virus particle to make it a functional virus. Without this step the virus cannot continue to infect other cells. So we developed \"protease inhibitors\". This chemical will bind to the HIV protease enzyme in such a way that the enzyme cannot function. By doing so you have blocked HIV at that last step of its lifecycle before it goes to infect more cells. That is another example. There are more but these two alone give you a good idea how a lot, but not all antivirals work. As mentioned though, we generally have to make these specific to the virus in most cases.\n\nNote that only some antivirals kill of an infection. HIV drugs block the virus but it is still in the patient. If you stop treating the virus will grow back. Other antivirals like those against Hepatitis C actually kill off the infection. The reasons for the difference has to do with the differences between different types of viruses which is a whole 'nother topic.",

            "comment": "Viruses use a lot of the host cell\u2019s machinery to reproduce. This makes targeting them difficult as you cant target any of your cell\u2019s functions. This is part why we don\u2019t have as many antivirals as we have antibiotics, there are just less targets. However viruses will still have some differences that make them targetable. ART therapies target the HIV reverse transcriptase and protease which are essential proteins unique to HIV not found in your healthy cells. Meanwhile bacteria have cellular machinery distinct from human cells allowing for lots of targets specific to the bacteria for antibiotics to act on. It also helps that other bacteria and fungi produce antibiotics to outcompete each other.\n\nAntivirals are usually specific to the type of virus. Antiretrovirals should not work on a herpesvirus because the herpesvirus does not have the proteins they target. However some antiretroviral drugs do work on other viruses, for example Ritonavir (found in Paxlovid) is an HIV drug that also works on the coronavirus protease. \n\nAlso, HIV is somewhat unique in that it mutates very rapidly. HIV started to become resistant to the first antiretroviral drugs within months. Today we get around this by using 3 separate classes of effective antiretroviral drugs simultaneously. That way if HIV gains resistance to one of them it will still be affected by the other two preventing that mutation from spreading/being selected for. However, if people stop taking their HIV meds those mutations can become widespread and then a second or third mutation can lead to resistance to all 3. Multi-drug resistant HIV is starting to become a problem, particularly in developing countries where people might have gaps in their access to the medication (allowing for mutations to take hold).",

Just amazed we can do anything about these viruses at all.\n\nJust as a question on the side, this may or may not be your field\u2026 if viruses aren\u2019t considered \u201clife\u201d; like bacteria is, what do we consider them to be?  Are they just geometric structures that interact with our cells?  \n\nThanks again",

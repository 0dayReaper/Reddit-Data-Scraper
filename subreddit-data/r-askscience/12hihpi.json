Instead of having lots of good working air sacs and a rubbery lung that expels air well, you get fewer big air sacs and a flabby lung that doesn't breathe out well.\n\nAsthma is an issue of reversible airway constriction, which is to say if someone has asthma, their lungs look healthy when they're not having an attack, unlike COPD. Normally it's just a different problem that you don't need to worry about, though some people do have conditions where features of asthma and COPD overlap.",

            "comment": "There are a few common ways you can lose lung function. The lung is composed largely of elastic tissue, and a combination of muscle and elasticity is responsible for the lung deflating correctly after inhalation. Failure to deflate is termed \"obstruction\" which is the O in COPD. COPD is chronic (the C), and asthma is typically thought of as reversible although these definitions have significant wiggle room.\n\nLung deflation depends on elasticity of the tissue and patency of the airways leading to the alveoli. So there's two major pieces going on here, which you can think of like a balloon. If the balloon becomes floppy, it's not going to have air come out. If the neck of the balloon collapses, like a whoopee cushion, or becomes blocked, the air won't come out. There are lots of downstream consequences to both of these phenomena -- for instance destruction of the alveolar gas exchange tissue and decreased lung compliance with overinflation -- but needless to say, the gist of it is that your lungs work worse if they can't deflate.\n\nAsthma and COPD are fundamentally two different paths to obstruction. Asthma is an allergic-type inflammation that causes cellular changes, leading to mucus hypersecretion and more crud in the airways, as well as muscle hyperreactivity that leads to narrower airways. The mainstay to asthma therapy is first treating inflammation and then the bronchoconstriction. First line therapy typically is inhaled steroid with added bronchodilators next (although in practice a lot of people get both).\n\nCOPD is typically non-allergic inflammation, typically as a response to cigarette smoke. However COPD is a rather broad umbrella with several diseases that could be classified as variants of COPD: emphysema (where the balloon becomes floppy due to destruction of lung elastic tissue and alveolar surface area), chronic bronchitis (like asthma but typically non-allergic in nature leading to increased crud in the airway), and bronchiectasis (chronic inflammation leading to floppiness of the airways). Since these are chronic changes of long-lasting inflammation, opening up airways is first priority, with treating inflammation and infection a secondary goal. First line therapy is bronchodilator with added steroid next (although in practice most people get both).",

For COPD ICS is decidedly second/third line. I'd nitpick slightly that while formoterol is a LABA, it has SABA activity and therefore preferred treatment is SABA/ICS (second GINA pathway) or formoterol/ICS (first GINA pathway); the LABA is pretty much second line and the reason to use formoterol is you get the LABA activity for free, essentially...",

Most of my normal spiros become abnormal on methacholine or cough incessantly, which is essentially a positive.\n\nNormal is also relative. A ratio of 71% in a D1 athlete is probably wildly abnormal, even though it's above the LLN. Context is everything.",

While orals can be lenient (though I'd say I did pretty well - even with mesothelioma, which I hate!), I had to pass a test where I had that question :-P and I did actually get a point there ;-) \n\nYet gina sticks to 12% and gold to 0,7 - gold cites not enough clinical trials, even though they have that big study lol",

This can have counterproductive ends as the increased pressures cause thickening of the vessel walls which increases the resistance and decreases gas exchange further which leads to more hypertension.\n\nLung disease is probably the most common cause of right sided heart failure, and right sided heart failure is one of the most common causes of left sided heart failure.",

Asthma is a triad of mucous plugging, bronchospasm, and inflammation, which are all obstructive of the air path to the alveoli. Smoking causes the airways to have early dynamic airway collapse, it basically causes the airways in the lungs to lose their rigidity. Emphysema and Chronic bronchitis are the two major issues that come along with chronic smoke inhalation. So COPD is the term used to describe all these issues.",

            "comment": "COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the hallmark of the disease is expiratory airflow limitation. The pathophysiology is complicated and multi factorial but the end result is air trapping in the lungs and decreased respiratory efficiency. \n\nThe number one cause of COPD is smoking. The damage from smoking is cumulative over a lifetime, and the metric we look at is total pack-years. That is number of years smoked times number of packs per day (at maximum use). Typically we won\u2019t see COPD with less that 30 pack-years, but it can happen sooner. 90-95% of COPD patients are smokers, but only about 20-25% of smokers will develop COPD, indicating there may be some sort of phenotype or some sort of genetic predisposition to developing the disease. \n\nThe thing about COPD is that is it irreversible airway disease. Contrasted with asthma, which is more of a bronchospastic disease, we see that asthma is more often reversible in terms of airflow limitation. Asthma does still have air trapping during an exacerbation, and under- or untreated asthmatics will often present with a COPD-like syndrome. However, once appropriately treated, symptoms typically resolve. The caveat to that is that chronic asthma that is poorly treated does lead to an atomic changes in the airways that mimic the changes seen in COPD, leading to some degree of irreversible airflow limitation. \n\nThere is also an entity called ACOS, or asthma-COPD overlap syndrome. This is when asthmatics smoke chronically and go from having reversible disease to having parenchymal destruction leading to irreversible disease. This is different from the airway remodeling that occurs in poorly treated asthma, as the pathophysiology is more in line with classic COPD. \n\nAny form of smoking leads to lung damage. The lungs don\u2019t like anything in them that isn\u2019t air. The reason we don\u2019t see it as much in cannabis users is the total cumulative dose is much lower. Someone with 30 pack-years of cigarette smoking would have smoked a pack a day (20 cigs) for 30 years. The equivalent cannabis use would be 15-17 joints per day for 30 years also. This degree of use is not common. \n\nVaping has special considerations, as there is no good long term data yet on what sort of lung damage may be occurring. We have seen acute lung injuries from vapes as well, with patients presenting with and ARDS-like syndrome. \n\nHookah is really bad for your lungs (it\u2019s mostly the flavorings), and one hour of smoking hookah is equivalent to about 5 packs of cigarettes. \n\nOther causes of COPD include biomass fuel (ie wood burning stoves in enclosed settings), chronic infections, anatomical abnormalities (musculoskeletal disease etc), or post-surgical or -trauma. \n\nTo summarize: COPD is a disease caused by a limitation in getting air out of the lungs. The most common cause is smoking. Untreated asthma can lead to a form of COPD, but it is uncommon.",

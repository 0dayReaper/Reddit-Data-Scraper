    "postText": "What kinds of compounds cause mushrooms, specifically mycelium, to smell the way it does? Specifically I'm referring to the wonderful aroma of a freshly broken up block of mushroom mycelium, but applies to the smell you pick up when you're in the woods and there is a lot of mushrooms nearby, or when you overturn a well-colonized clod of duff from the forest floor. It is a very particular odor that is definitely pleasant, almost sweet, earthy, and very rich or thick- if you've ever cultivated mushrooms of any sort, you know that powerful and aromatic smell I'm talking about.",

            "comment": "Fungal colonies do their digestion primarily outside of their own cell walls. So their hyphae(cells) are constantly secreting enzymes into their surrounding environment- which break down biomass into all kinds of useful other stuff just like your stomach does.\n\nSo the substrate is saturated in glucose, proteins, alkaloids, ketones, terpenes,- many of which are actively undergoing some chemical reaction or decomposition- and can be quite volatile when exposed to open air. \n\nTldr; their stomach contents are on the outside and you would smell similarly if yours was too.",

Some secret acetalehyde and other toxins. Some form symbiotic relationships with tree roots and share resources. Some are straight up parasites.",

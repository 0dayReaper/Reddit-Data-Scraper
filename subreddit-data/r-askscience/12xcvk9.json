At some point in the past these viruses became permanently incorporated into our genetic material. It's also theorized that these fragments pay an important part in evolution.\n\nWe realized these existed from studying our genetic sequence and noticing patterns in it that were almost identical to those found in viruses. And since these don't actively make new virus molecules they are as asymptomatic as it gets.",

Random chance on top of random chance over the course of billions of years.\n\n A similar case can be found with Eukaryotic life in-general (all life more complex than a single cell) also relied on the similarly improbable event of endosymbiosis. Where-in a proto-eukaryotic cell absorbed an oxygen-metabolism bacteria into itself  and instead of eating it hosted it, taking its excess energy for its own. Eventually, the bacteria became mitochondria. Hence why mitochondria have their own DNA and ribosomes, as they were originally separate organisms entirely.",

It would fuse together surrounding cells, creating a wall of fused cells that the white blood cells couldn't penetrate.  Nutrients could still pass through, but the host's immune system couldn't reach the virus.\n\nThat virus got incorporated into it's host's DNA.  With a few tweaks it soon started coding for the placenta, which is fused cells that mammals use to stop a mother's blood from mixing with the baby's, and protects the fetus from attack from the mom's immune system.\n\nSo without this virus, humans wouldn't exist.

However, let me present the [Anellovirus](https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/44/3/305/5809966) (open access paper)! Anelloviruses are present in &gt;95% of the human population, no matter which continent they live, and might probably even reach 100% of the world population. They are detected in children and adults of all ages, present in most body fluids, and do not seem to cause any harm or disease even when immunocompromised. It is thought that basically all newborns get infected the moment they come in contact with the vaginal fluids when born, and while unlikely, it's not ruled out that transmission already occurs as early as in the placenta. It's probable that most humans are either chronically infected or continuously re-infected, which reduces the likelihood that anelloviruses are truly causing any disease.\n\nWhile it's impossible to say if anelloviruses are truly commensal (or even beneficial), I'd like to make the case that there are actually quite a lot of these kind of viruses. Research is not overtly interested in them, as they do no cause any harm and thus are overlooked. It's hard to study viruses as is, let alone those that are present everywhere, so there is no reference of uninfected vs infected people to compare.",

I think there's a good chance we have some antibodies that react to antigens on bacteriophage, though they don't tend to stimulate a strong immune response and sustained high titres (so more like a food antigen then a viral antigen)",

I've been reading an interesting review article, [Interactions between bacteriophage, bacteria, and the mammalian immune system](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6356784/). They make two points that are relevant to this:\n\n1. We have known the immune cells in the intestines are constantly sampling antigens present in the lumen from both commensal and pathogenic bacteria, and maintain microbial homeostasis. Turns out, the virome also constantly simulates low-level immune response. This continuous inflammatory state protects against pathogenic viral infections. \n2. Phages induce production of neutralizing antibodies against them, which was observed in people who received phage therapy. An interesting fact: immunizing with bacteriophage phix174 has been used since the 1970s to diagnose immunodeficiencies.",

So an antigen can be part of a defunct virus that has already been neutralized by the immune system, or on an intact viable virus particle that hasn't infected anyone yet (called a virion).\n\nThere are methods for detecting the amounts of a virus within a body, which is performed on patients with chronic virus diseases (such as HIV and hepatitis). These tests are a special kind of PCR test called digital PCR, which can actually quantify the amount of genetic material present. This is generally considered the best method for measuring the level of virus activity in an infected patient, as the level of virus genetetic material is directly related to the amount of virus reproduction taking place.",

The same goes for antigen based tests, because an antigen is a known thing that an antibody recognizes. This means we wouldn't know the body is making antibodies that recognize a specific antigen unless we have already identified that antigen. Your body may very well be making antibodies that recognize something but we can't tell unless we expose those antibodies to that specific antigen (the something).\n\nNow, as per my knowledge, there is theoretically a mass based way to detect this. Essentially we would need to have a before infection, and an after infection blood sample of the patient. Then using MALDI or some other form of mass spec we'd have to measure the mass of the antibodies in the blood sample. If there were an asymptomatic virus in the patient, we would expect a large amount of a novel antibody with a mass that is not in the before sample.",

Say you have sequenced the genes of a sick person with an unknown illness. If you go through and sequence and count the new things (blue hats) and compare that to other (healthy) samples where there are no people with blue hats, then you can suspect the blue hats to be the new disease. Then you can find another sick person and instead of sequencing just ask 'do they have sequences with blue hats'?

    "postText": "Perhaps an obvious question, since I believe relativity states that you couldn't know your own velocity, but im not sure if there's a more interesting answer.\n\nIf you were placed in a sealed box moving at close to the speed of light through empty space, is there any kind of experiment you could run that would tell you anything about your velocity? Perhaps you could notice the wavelength of light shifting in your box.",

            "comment": "You are in that box right now.  The point is, you have to measure speed relative to something else and nobody is special.  That means you can decide you are stationary and some piece of a star tossed aside by the black hole in the center of the milky way is going near the speed of light.  OR the other way around: it's stationary and YOU are moving really fast relative to it.  If you start \\*comparing\\* things in your \"reference frame\" and that of the star stuff (like the length of rulers or light waves) then you can tell that you are moving relative to each other.  All this neglects acceleration, which makes things more complicated (general vs. special relativity).  Hope that helps.",

(by its hard cap on speed capacity to reach the observer.... Right?)\n\nEdit: I guess if the light is being seen it is ultimately being reflected or otherwise emitted towards the observer...also sorry to anyone who read this pre-edit...lol\n\nEdit2: in pondering it more, what does the entity in the box see of the beam once it reaches the wall of the box?... I need to sleep...but.. There is an intuition of doubling, which I am assuming in reality just doesn't exist as it's a matter of containment and perception and physical limits but...

They'll see the lamp come on and light move away at c in all directions, but the back of the train car is moving towards the light while the front is moving away, so they see light hit the back wall first. \n\nRelativity is full of these seeming contradictions, and we find that things like time dilation and length contraction pop up to sorta \"solve\" them. Our observations suggest that c is the absolute, and things we normally think of as immutable, like time and size, will warp based on your reference frame.\n\nThe big weird takeaway in the above example is that even the concept of two events being simultaneous is dependent on your reference frame.  The two observers don't just see things happen at different times - for them those things literally do happen at different times in their reference frame.",

When you start moving at relativistic speeds compared to another object, *time for you slows down* to the point where no other object in the universe will ever appear to be going faster than the speed of light.",

No matter how fast you move, then produce light, the light you see will still be going the speed of light to your perspective. Or another way to put it is you can't throw light. Red shifting occurs because space is bigger now than when the light started so the physical space is bigger. I could be messing up your question and some concepts. I may be a bit wrong on red shifting only being due to spaces physical expansion and not the actual movement itself, but I'm pretty sure.",

This would either mean 1) the CMB really is just warmer in one direction or 2) a lot of the visible matter in the local universe is moving in one direction relative to the CMB for some reason. Both of those options are challenging to standard cosmology:\n\n&gt; If it is established that the distribution of distant matter in the large-scale universe does not share the same reference frame as the CMB, then it will become imperative to ask whether the differential expansion of space produced by nearby nonlinear structures of voids and walls and filaments can indeed be reduced to just a local boost[]. Alternatively, the CMB dipole may need to be interpreted in terms of new physics, e.g., as a remnant of the preinflationary universe...  a serious disagreement between the standards of rest defined by distant quasars and the CMB may require abandoning the standard FLRW cosmology itself\n\n[An article from one of the authors exploring this idea in general](https://inference-review.com/article/heart-of-darkness):\n\n&gt; It showed that while the summed effects of the known superclusters of galaxies could account for much of the observed bulk flow, there was still no convergence to the cosmic rest frame. Infrared and X-ray surveys have brought further evidence that the flow continues out to the Shapley Supercluster at ~180/h Mpc. We confirmed this using the Union 2 catalog of Type Ia supernovae to obtain distances to their host galaxies in order to perform tomography of the local velocity field. Using the same technique, the Nearby Supernova Factory collaboration has shown that the bulk flow continues even beyond Shapley, out to ~300 Mpc, thus requiring an even bigger inhomogeneity to drive it. A detailed map of local structures by Brent Tully and collaborators uses direct distance measurements to determine these peculiar velocities. It shows that this motion is in fact coherent across the Laniakea Supercluster, in which we live.\n\n&gt; So far as the universe has been mapped in detail, there is no convergence to the cosmic microwave background frame.\n\n&gt; In a review of these puzzling observations, the astronomer James Gunn expressed a radical thought: \u201cMost of the problem, it seems to me, would disappear if the [cosmic microwave background] did not, in fact, provide a rest frame.\u201d",

So, how do you \"see\" (ie measure) the bullet moving at different speeds? Well, speed is generally measured as a function of time! Miles/hour, Meters/second, etc. \n\nSo, to reconcile this, you have to grasp that _your_ second on the spaceship is much shorter than the second of a stationary observer on earth! For both of you, the bullet is moving at, say 3k kilometers/hour, but your hour is much shorter than the observer's, so in your frame, the bullet seems to be moving away from you more quickly.",

Faster you move through space, slower you move through time. Both those speeds combined are always equal to speed of light, and every atom in the universe is always moving at speed of light. \n\nYou for instance, are moving at speed of light already. But mostly through time. \n\nPhysicists often forget to tell us that it is only impossible to move at speed of light\u2026. through space ONLY. That\u2019s why it is confusing.",

Two events at different locations that seem to appear simultaneously to one observer do not happen simultaneously for another observer who is moving relative to the first one (meaning that one event happens before another). This helps to see how light can travel at the fixed speed of light to all observers even though it would seemingly break the sequence of events otherwise.\n\nThis (if you follow the logic and trace through different possibilities) is also why if you can travel faster than speed of light you can eventually time travel by sending messages back to the past if you play around with it.",

If you are going 99% of the speed of light relative to the sun, the light from the sun will still reach you at the speed of light, as measured by you, and as measured by the sun.\n\nWhat does change is distance and time. Distance and time will bend and stretch based on how fast you are going. The speed of light (in vacuum) is absolute in all directions, even relative to all velocities. \n\nThat's why many thought Einstein was off his rocker, until he was proven correct.",

Once the speeds get high, these equations don't work anymore. See \"special relativity\" section - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_velocity.  Check out the parallel velocities, and notice that for small values of v, it's basically a simple subtraction, as their product over c^2 is basically 0.  As they approach c, the difference approaches c - one will have a negative sign, which turns the denominator into ~2.",

The speed of light isn't an arbitrary speed limit light travels at, it's determined by basic properties of the Universe that determine the laws of physics. Those laws require any object with mass to expend an infinite amount of energy to accelerate to the speed of light. It's simply impossible for any mass bearing object to travel at or above the speed of light because laws governing spacetime do not allow it.",

Part of the equation, the full equation is the pythagorean addition of the mass energy to and the momentum energy,\n\nE=sqrt(m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2)\n\nThis coupled with some other relativity implies:\n\nv = pc/E\n\nAs your momentum increases, the energy gets closer and closer to the momentum times the speed of light, but it never *quite* reaches that as long as you have some mass, which is why objects with mass can never reach the speed of light. Only in the limit does E = pc, which you can never reach (You'd need infinite energy)",

Different reference systems will provide different relative speeds, and they are all equally correct.",

From the point of view of the person on the spaceship, people on Earth *also* age slowly.\n\nThe \"paradox\" comes in when you *bring them back together again* - which requires the person on the spaceship to turn around and come back. As they do the U-turn, all the information that they've been \"running away from\" (due to time dilation) suddenly catches up to them in a rush, and from that point on they'll see the person on Earth as having aged more than they have.

In this case in the box light moves just like youd normally expect, but to an outside observer a combination of length contraction, time dilation, and the relativity of simultaneity all combine to create a picture where light in the box still goes c in both directions and still manages to agree with the in box measurement. This is quite difficult to express in text form, video might help. Minutephysics has a pretty nice series on this.

Many of them will just say that one twin is older and leave it at that, which is NOT the twin paradox. Your question here is.\n\nThe resolution is quite complicated, but in short the symmetry is broken by the fact that only one twin (the twin on the rocket) experiences a change in reference frames, which is absolutely not relative and is even easily measurable. The crux is that the reference frame of a rocket returning to earth that passes through the turn around point in the moment in time it happens is a reference frame where the twin on the rocket and everything else in it will be older than something originally synchronized with it on earth when both were at rest relative to each other (the other twin, for example)\n\nThe rocket twin must experience either an acceleration to change reference frames or must experience gravity, like a gravitational slingshot. For the latter you need general relativity but for acceleration you can describe it purely in special relativity. Both will result in the same answer because fundamentally it's not the acceleration that really matters, it's the change in reference frame.\n\nThe best write-up, in my opinion, that I've seen of this is here from Virginia Tech, but it is quite dense: https://www1.phys.vt.edu/\\~jhs/faq/twins.html",

Of course, the beam travels in a straight line at the speed of light.\n\nFor you (train going down):\n\n| \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014|\n\nNow I\u2019m looking at you, from outside the train. To me, the light doesn\u2019t go in a straight line, but diagonally. Since the train is moving \u201cdown\u201d and the laser is moving right. \n\nFor me (train going down):\n\n| \u2014\u2014\n\n|.        \u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n|.                     \u2014\u2014-|\n\nSo far so good. Just notice that for me the beam travels a longer distance. \n\nBut now let\u2019s ask \u201cwhen\u201d does the laser hit the wall?\n\nFor you, it covers the distance in time t1. \n\nIf, for me, it also covered the distance in time t1, that would mean it travels faster than the speed of light (since for me it travels diagonally, and so travels a longer distance in the same amount of time). \n\nBut that would mean the speed of light is not constant!\n\nSo what else can change in the equation?\n\nSpeed = distance / time\n\nIf the speed of the laser is the same, but the distance is different, that means the **time** (duration of travel) must be different. \n\nSo for me, the laser hits the mirror at t2 which is not equal to t1!\n\nHuh? How can the same event (laser hitting wall), happen at different times?\n\n**Because time passes differently for each different frame of reference**. \n\nSo to answer your question:\n\nYou couldn\u2019t tell, because for you time (and so the wavelength which depends on frequency which depends on time), is the same as it would be in any other situation. And any experiment you do from your frame of reference, without something external to it, will come out the same as if you did it in any other frame of reference. \n\nAnother question could be \u201chow do we know the speed of light is constant in all reference frames?\u201d. They probably did an experiment idk this comment is already super long. \n\nHere\u2019s a more in depth video about this:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AInCqm5nCzw",

So you can\u2019t even say that your traveling at near the speed of light, only that another observer would measure your speed as close to the speed of light -in their reference frame-",

Moving faster through space means you're moving slower through time and vice versa. Once you're at the maximum speed through space (light speed), you no longer experience time.

A larger gravity well means more space is being \"sucked\" past you, so you're moving faster through space, thus more time dilation.",

For you, you accelerate at the same rate always, for everyone else, you approach C at ever decreasing rates of acceleration.\n\n  \n\n\nThis is also basically what happens to photons. They accelerate to infinitely fast in their own frame of reference and travel from their source to destination instantly, but for everyone else's frame of reference they sit ar the speed of light (aka the speed of time).",

Because in this analogy you aren't walking through space, you're walking through time. Everything in front of you is the future and everything behind you is the past.\n\nIf you both walk parallel to each other, you both stay side by side - and since your twin is exactly off to your side, you exist in the same time.\n\nImagine you turn 45 degrees to your right and start walking. Your twin is now somewhat behind you, so he is in your \"past\". But since you're going off at an angle, you are also now behind him, so you are in his past - this feels wrong but is possible because there is no universal clock to measure against - time can exist differently depending on reference frames and thus two people can both say the other is an hour behind them and both be right.\n\nNow, you turn left 90 degrees and start walking back towards your twin. They're ahead of you and thus in \"your\" future, though you're behind them and thus in their past. It's not the walking that creates the disagreement over whether one of you is further \"ahead\" than the other, it's the turning.",

Because the laws of physics are constant in every reference frame, that means other things must be variable such as time. The implication of this fact is that you experience less subjective time the faster you go.   \n\nLet's say Twin 1 is on a planet orbitting Alpha Centauri, located 4 light years away. He wants to return to Earth where his brother Twin 2 lives. He boards a spaceship which travels back to Earth at a velocity very close to the speed of light. Twin 1 only experiences a few days of travel time. However, four years have passed for Twin 2. Because Twin 1 was on the spaceship, he experienced less time passing and is now four years younger than his brother.   \n\nIn order for physics to be a constant in every reference frame, it requires time to be variable. The faster you move, the less time you'll experience relative to someone standing still on Earth. Time will always appear to pass at the same rate for you no matter how fast you're moving. But if you compare your watch with someone in a difference reference frame, you'll find a different amount of time has passed for you. This can lead to situations where someone in a spaceship only travels a few days, but someone on Earth experiences years. The closer you get to the speed of light, the more dramatic the effect becomes.",

So your time will adjust accordingly.\n\nSimilarly, if you are moving 90% of c, light only has 10% of c to spend moving in any direction not along your vector, so time again adjusts accordingly.\n\nI think how I really wrap my head around it is simplifying life/consciousness down to the movement of electrons.\n\nElectrons can only move at some finite speed.\n\nWhatever speed+direction you\u2019re going will then impact the speed at which they can move other directions.\n\nThis is why within a reference frame, we do not perceive the time shift, because our perception of reality is in fact distorted by our vector of travel.\n\nBut someone outside of your reference frame, in a slower reference frame, would have a different speed of electrons rattling around in their head, and would be able to perceive things at THEIR perception speed, which would be \u201cfaster\u201d than that of yours - as they would be capable of more non-vector movement of electrons within the same amount of \u201cobjective time\u201d than you would be.\n\nDid this help at all, or is it still clear as mud? \ud83d\ude05",

But when they did the experiment, it turns out that you can't. \n\nRelativity basically says that you can observe accelerations but not speeds without reference to something else you can see moving. This shouldn't be that surprising if you've ever been in something fast like an airplane. \n\nEven if you had a window and could see the stars whizzing by in one direction, you still can't tell the difference between your motion and theirs. And light is always observed to travel at the same speed, no matter how fast you're going. Those are, technically, the only two assumptions of special relativity.

            "comment": "I've seen a lot of pretty complicated answers, here. I think there's a much simpler answer to the question that obviates a lot of the nonsense. As humans, our bodies detect *acceleration*, not velocity. If my understanding is correct, this is because one of the main sensory organs for the perception of motion in the human body ([the Otolith](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolith)) relies on the movement of a fluid over a bed of sensory nerves in your inner ear.\n\nEssentially, your brain is computing your linear acceleration by measuring the **relative velocity** (basically, the difference between the velocities of two objects in a given reference frame) between the fluid and the bed of nerves. *[NB this is a gross oversimplification and the sensory system is doing something much more interesting, but much more complicated]* For there to be a difference in velocity between the fluid and the structure of the inner ear, acceleration must be occurring. You must be speeding up, slowing down, or changing directions. In the case of a sealed compartment moving at a constant speed in a straight line (i.e., constant velocity), none of those are happening, and your entire body and everything in it will be moving at the same velocity.\n\nWithout visual cues to indicate motion, you would have no idea you were even moving. As far as I'm aware, proximity to lightspeed should not affect this reality. A good example of this is flying in a passenger jet: on a smooth flight, you can get up and walk to the bathroom as if you were on solid ground, despite being thousands of feet off the ground, moving at 300+ miles an hour. It's a sealed compartment with limited visual indicators of relative motion. You aren't accelerating, so to your brain, it's as if you aren't moving at all.\n\n**EDIT: NOTE TO SELF: Learn to read, man.**",

            "comment": "If the box is sealed you couldn\u2019t make observations of electromagentic radiation from outside, but what about gravitational waves? Perhaps a gravitational wave observatory could observe red shift and blue shift being more prevalent in different directions and use that to determine a sense of forward and backward, as well as a speed?",

            "comment": "According to the theory of relativity, if you were in a sealed box moving at close to the speed of light through empty space, you would not be able to tell that you were in motion, as there is no preferred frame of reference in the universe. In other words, you would experience the same physical laws and phenomena as if you were at rest.\n\nThis concept is known as \"relativity of motion.\" The laws of physics, including those governing light, electromagnetism, and other phenomena, are the same for all observers in uniform motion relative to each other. This means that any experiment you could perform inside the sealed box would give the same results regardless of whether the box was at rest or moving at constant velocity.\n\nBut there is one effect that you might observe if you were in a sealed box moving at close to the speed of light: time dilation. According to the theory of relativity, time appears to pass more slowly for objects in motion relative to an observer at rest. This means that if you had a clock inside the sealed box, it would appear to run slower than a clock at rest relative to the observer.\n\nAlso, if you had a way to observe the outside world, you might notice that objects outside the box appeared to be contracted in the direction of motion. This effect is known as \"length contraction\" and is a consequence of the relativity of motion.\n\nSo while you wouldn't be able to tell that you were in motion inside a sealed box moving at close to the speed of light, you might observe some unusual effects such as time dilation and length contraction if you had a way to observe the outside world or perform experiments inside the box.",

The galaxy is moving around space at 1.3M mi/hr. The speed of light is 671M mi/hr. So do you feel anything?  Everything on earth is the Same no matter what. Until you can see distant stars or galaxies to compare to which you are looking outside the box then you know your relative movement.",

            "comment": "People have answered your question pretty well, but I just want to underscore an important point that can get lost in all the explanations. The key to Relativity is that saying you are moving at close to the speed of light is a meaningless statement. There *is* no movement without something to compare that movement to. In your box in space, simply put, *you are not moving*. \n\nIf you allow information to enter your box from outside (i.e. a window), you can see that other objects are moving relative to you at various speeds, but you are always in your own reference frame, which is always at rest. If you accelerate,  your reference frame changes relative to those other objects, and because you accelerated, you will experience relativistic effects, but you will still be in your own personal reference frame, which is still, as far as you are concerned, not moving.\n\nBecause we spend most of our lives right next to a huge hunk of rock (i.e. the Earth), we tend to think of motion as absolute. But really, we're just using the Earth's reference frame as a default and when we say we're moving, what we mean is, we're moving according to an observer in Earth's reference frame. When we don't have an Earth around, we don't have that obvious reference frame to defer to. In deep space, you could float from one end of your box to the other and say you're \"moving\" by deferring to the box's reference frame, but that's the same situation as when you're on Earth, just with a smaller object that you're referencing from.\n\nThe bottom line is, the only reference frame you actually inhabit, is *your* reference frame. How could it be any other way? And you are never moving relative to your own reference frame. In that sense, you are *always* at rest and the universe moves around you.",

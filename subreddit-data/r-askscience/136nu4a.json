            "comment": "To the extent that \"nebula\" means a cloud of diffuse material, there are dark matter nebulae. We call them \"[halos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter_halo)\", because they are known to surround galaxies. However, halos are also expected to exist that are smaller than galaxies and do not contain any visible matter. Small halos can also exist inside larger ones. [Here's a classic picture](https://wwwmpa.mpa-garching.mpg.de/aquarius/Aq-A-1-114_6144x4608.jpg) of what a dark matter halo would look like that's comparable to the halo of our own galaxy, if dark matter were luminous. The host halo occupies basically the whole picture, and each of the points are smaller halos inside it.\n\nThere are several important differences between a dark matter halo and a gaseous cloud, though. Gases have frequent short-range particle-particle interactions, which enable phenomena like pressure, sound, and heat transfer. Dark matter does not have nongravitational interactions -- or if it does, they are very weak. Consequently, dark matter halos are not supported against gravity by any pressure. Instead, they are supported against collapse by the orbits of the constituent particles, which are generally oriented in random directions.\n\nAlso, gases of ordinary matter can shed orbital energy by converting it into light. This allows gas clouds to condense into galaxies, stars, and such. Dark matter cannot efficiently shed its orbital energy, so it remains in diffuse halos.",

Well, they are still very popular even - they just don't dominate the discourse anymore.\n\nThe main reason is that we didn't find evidence for supersymmetry in the LHC, and the simplest WIMP candidate would have been the lightest supersymmetric partner. Even then, it is only *supersymmetry at energy scales necessary to solve the electroweak hierarchy problem* that is becoming disfavored due to LHC nondetection, not supersymmetry in general.",

We don't know what dark matter is, but we do know how it behaves: we know how much of it there is, how it's distributed, and how it interacts with itself and with ordinary matter. Also, other than the fact that their names both contain the word \"dark\", there's no relation between dark matter and dark energy.\n\nThe aether was hypothesised to solve a philosophical problem: it was believed that a wave could not propagate without a medium. There was never any experimental evidence that supported its existence, and as soon as an experiment to test it was devised, the hypothesis was refuted. \n\nDark matter has already cleared that hurdle: there is unambiguous observational evidence for it, independent of the actual identity of the dark matter particle.",

    "postText": "There has been tremendous progress in recent years of human genetics research that illuminates our understanding of the ancestral and genealogical connections between people around the world. This is due in part to advancements in genome sequencing, increased participation in research from diverse populations, and greater collaboration among researchers. This strengthens our ability to drive discovery and new applications in research, medicine, and society for all. \u00a0\n\nWe are human genetics researchers who are part of the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG), the world's largest professional community driving the field of human genetics and genomics research and translation. ASHG is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year with the theme, \"One Humanity, Many Genomes\". While each genome - and therefore each of us - is unique, we all make up a greater humanity that we are all part of. As humans, we are more alike than different.\n\nWe're here to answer your questions and celebrate with you! Our panel includes:\n\n+ **Arvind Kothandaraman** (/u/No-Bar3356) is a biotech-business hybrid. His professional work has revolved around equipping laboratories with the tools needed to meet vital technical and operational goals. Kothandaraman is passionate about bridging the gap between credible, actionable information and public awareness particularly in multifaceted areas like medical science. He considers every interaction to be a learning opportunity, greatly enjoys knowledge exchange and considers it to be an extremely effective method to invigorate the mind.\n+ **[Lord Jephthah Joojo Gowans, PhD](https://webapps.knust.edu.gh/staff/dirsearch/profile/summary/c6e95924e672.html)**, (/u/U_DNA_LjjGowans) Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi, Ghana. I research Mendelian and complex congenital anomalies or birth defects, and human population genetics, and promote the implementation of precision genetic and genomic medicine in low-resource settings. Ask me about the causes and global distribution of birth defects and available treatment interventions.\n+ **Sureni V Mullegama, PhD**, (/u/BriteLite-DNAWestie3) Gene DX in Gaithersburg Maryland, and College of Osteopathic Medicine (COM) in Woodlands, Texas. She is an Assistant Director of Clinical Genetics at\nGene Dx and an Assistant Professor of Genetics at COM and her primary interest is in the diagnosis of genetic conditions, new disease discovery, and neurogenetics. Ask me about clinical molecular genetics or neurogenetics.\n+ **Nancy Sey, PhD**, (/u/Leading_Strand) Education Fellow at American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG)/National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). I am the Education Fellow at ASHG working to broaden community engagement in genetics and genomics. I studied how genetics\ncontributes to susceptibility of drug use during my graduate training.\n+ **Christina Vallianatos, PhD**, (/u/ChristinaVPhD\u00a0&amp; [Twitter@ChristinaVPhD](https://twitter.com/ChristinaVPhD) ) The Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine in Farmington, Connecticut. In my role as a Genomics Education &amp; Outreach Program Manager, I combine my content expertise in human genetics with my passion for outreach and engagement and work to build bridges into communities to improve access to and understanding of a variety of genetics topics. Ask me all your genetics questions, from genetics basics, genome diversity, ethics and equity in genetics research and medicine, to genetics careers, and more!\n\nDNA Day commemorates the completion of the Human Genome Project in April 2003 and the discovery of the double helix of DNA in 1953. ASHG celebrates through the\u00a0[DNA Day Essay Contest](https://www.ashg.org/dna-day/), which is open to high school students around the world and asks them to write an essay about a topic in human genetics.\n\nThe American Society of Human Genetics was a partner in organizing today's AMA.

ACE2 expression is a major determinant of COVID-19 susceptibility, but is also under strong epigenetic influence so the role of typical Mendelian inheritance in this scenario (and other instances of genetic predisposition to infectious disease) is not straightforward. There is also the confounder that predisposition to infection is not necessarily coincident with predisposition to disease severity, such as the case with the sensationalized headlines about smokers (who have suppressed ACE2 expression) being \u201cresistant to COVID-19\u201d. They had slightly lower infection rates (since the entry route is restricted) but faced much more severe disease and mortality.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34258966/\n\nA hypothetical example is that predisposition to infection but resistance to disease severity (rendered by some unspecified number of pleiotropic genes) might actually convey a strong selective advantage, particularly in the case of our awfully altricial species, since having a healthy mom chock-full of antibodies is a huge bonus from the perspective of the lineage.",

Thanks for sharing your story and for the Q.A simple answer is that brain development is so complex, and even the smallest changes to that process can have big and lasting effects on brain function. Effects of personal DNA changes and/or environmental differences can accumulate over time and lead to big trait differences. There are many researchers around the world trying to understand brain development and function, and also investigating autism and all its forms.It\u2019s important to note that, for the most part, all humans share the same genes\\*. It's not so much about having or not having important genes, it's more about the variation within these genes, within our individual DNA, that can have wide influences in our traits.Brain development is a very complex process, so many genes are involved throughout your life, especially early on in development, and environmental factors can also contribute. Large or small differences in our genomes can influence our traits. It can be an accumulation of many small changes (a little too much gene expressed at the wrong time, not enough gene expressed when it\u2019s needed, a gene staying on too long, etc.)Also, autism itself has a wide spectrum of traits associated with it, that we know have associations with many many genetic differences. Here\u2019s something that helps explain the autism-genetics link: [https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/autism-genetics-explained/](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/autism-genetics-explained/)\n\n*\\*Of course there are what we call \u201cstructural variations\u201d like deletions in your DNA resulting in missing parts of DNA, or duplications resulting in additional copies of parts of DNA. These can be small (few bases) or large (big chunks of a chromosome) or very large (entire chromosome).*",

Interestingly, there are ethnic variations in the incidence of this disease. Populations of Asian ancestry have the highest incidence (about 1 in 500 live births), followed by populations of European ancestry (about 1 in 1000 live births), with populations of African ancestry having the lowest incidence of 1 in 1200 live births. Just like all structural birth defects, the management of this condition requires a multidisciplinary approach, requiring surgeons, nutritionists, speech therapists, psychologists, social workers, and geneticists. A cleft lip is usually repaired by surgery at 3 months whereas a cleft palate is usually repaired after 9 months. Other treatments may be required afterward.",

There are two things I\u2019d like the mention: (1) the DNA we have in our bodies is not representative of ALL of our ancestors, some is lost over time based on how DNA is inherited over the generations; and (2) DNA ancestry tests are limited in what they can tell you and rely heavily on the population reference databases used.\n\n  \n(1) We know that DNA is inherited across generations - we get our DNA from our biological parents, they got their DNA from their parents, etc. But DNA is also lost in each generation. Each biological parent only contributes half of their DNA to the next generation, so you\u2019ll never get all of the DNA from all your ancestors. Your DNA is a snapshot, just a glimpse of what parts of DNA happen to be passed on to you. Not having certain variations does not mean your ancestors did not come from those populations.  \n(2) DNA ancestry tests currently work by analyzing single nucleotide variations across the genome. Depending on the company, they will examine hundreds or thousands of DNA sites. They are not looking at the entire genome, it is not complete genome sequencing! A lot of information is missed. You\u2019re also right to question the databases these companies are using to draw their conclusions - do they have 50 individuals or 500 individuals? What do they define as \u201cNative American\u201d or \u201cAsian\u201d or \u201cEuropean\u201d because often these are broad!   \nFinally I\u2019ll say, regarding accuracy, that everything has limitations. With DNA ancestry tests, you\u2019re not really looking at anyone\u2019s ancestry. You\u2019re looking at one snapshot of genomes at this moment. You\u2019re really comparing the people you have and asking how similar are these groups of people are to each other.   \nHere are some resources you might enjoy:\n\n* [https://www.genome.gov/dna-day/15-ways/human-origins-ancestry](https://www.genome.gov/dna-day/15-ways/human-origins-ancestry) \n* [https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/dtcgenetictesting/ancestrytesting/](https://medlineplus.gov/genetics/understanding/dtcgenetictesting/ancestrytesting/) \n* [https://elsihub.org/video/exploring-difference-biology-classroom-what-genetic-ancestry-tests-mean-and-what-they-dont](https://elsihub.org/video/exploring-difference-biology-classroom-what-genetic-ancestry-tests-mean-and-what-they-dont)\n* InThoseGenes podcast [http://player.audiostaq.com/inthosegenes/intronic\\_season](http://player.audiostaq.com/inthosegenes/intronic_season)",

            "comment": "The genotype tissue expression project (GTEx) has revolutionized the way we interpret genetic variants that are associated with disease risk. For people unfamiliar, DNA can be thought of as the recipe, and different people may have the same recipe or their recipes may differ. RNA can be thought of as the batter- people with the same recipe might make different amounts of batter, and people with different recipes may have slightly different kinds of batter. Further, even though your liver and your lung contain the same recipes, they might make different amounts of batter, which is part of what gives different tissues in your body different functions. Proteins are like the muffins- even if you start out with lots of batter, you might then produce different kinds of muffins- bigger or smaller, or fewer of them if you spill some batter, you might burn them, etc. The GTEx project allowed geneticists to link DNA (recipes) to RNA (batter) in  hundreds of people in \\~50 different tissues. So now, when a geneticist finds a DNA variant that is associated with a disease or trait, they can look that variant up in the GTEx database to learn about it's tissue-specific association with RNA levels- in short enabling researchers to link a genetic variant associated with disease to its *function*. BUT, and this is a pretty big BUT, the GTEx project was done in a group of people that represent primarily European ancestries. Could the panel weigh in on what the impact of this is on interpreting genetic findings across populations? And if they got the chance to design a new GTEx project today, what would they do the same or differently?",

Differences in numbers come from whether you're talking about ALL of our DNA genomes, or only the protein-coding parts of our genomes (for example, we're about 98% similar to gorillas when comparing the protein-coding parts of our genome, but that drops to about 89% when you look at the whole genomes). That's because the protein-coding parts of our genomes usually do the big functions (and therefore are more sensitive to changes, so an important function is likely to be preserved over time), and the rest of our genomes generally help regulate (so are less sensitive to changes, so some DNA sequence differences can evolve over time and/or become species-specific). A lot of numbers and \u201cfacts\u201d get thrown out without the proper references, and it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re wrong it\u2019s just hard to know precisely what people are comparing if they\u2019re not citing specifics.\n\nFrom mice, to fish, to yeast, and bacteria, we share a good number of genetics and gene/protein function, which is why we use model organisms in research!\n\n[Comparative genomics](https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Comparative-Genomics-Fact-Sheet) is an exciting field!

The differences between individual humans are due to genetic variations that occur within the human population. These variations are responsible for the differences we see in our physical traits such as heigh, eye color, hair texture, and also susceptibility to certain illnesses. It is important to note that the differences between individuals are quite small (\\~1%) and that we do share 99% of DNA with each other.",

However, within genes and \"non-gene\" portions of our DNA, there could be changes in the building blocks of DNA that occur at a particular place. There are four building blocks that make up our DNA; i.e. A, C, T, and G. For example, at position 10 in a particular gene, an individual may have C but another individual of a different ancestry may have T at this position. This is an example of genetic variation - there are more such variations. Over time, we are trying to build reference databases that capture these variations in various human populations. These databases serve as the basis for estimating the ancestry of any individual. However, we are yet to capture the entire variation in human populations across the world - this may limit the accuracy of ancestry estimation since some populations are not represented in the reference databases.

Thus, sexual reproduction cannot be an avenue to produce a hybrid between humans and other species. However, through recombinant DNA technology and other genetic engineering techniques, we can pick up DNA from humans and send it to other organisms and vice versa. Note that not the entire DNA is moved around, but a  bit of it (such as a particular gene) that directs a particular trait of interest.\n2. Generally, a gene is recessive when both copies of the gene (one from Dad and one from Mom) must be mutated before the trait shows up; e.g. sickle cell disease. In dominant conditions, just one mutant copy of the gene (whether maternal or paternal) will cause disease - e.g., cancer-causing genes called oncogenes. Thus, genes have unique \"behaviors\" toward traits; some will require mutant two copies to change the original trait to a different one, and other genes will require just one mutant copy to show the disease. These observations may not permit changing a recessive gene to a dominant one!\n3. If the genetic factor is due to a single gene, it could be varied by gene editing techniques. We are currently limited to gene editing of complex traits that may be controlled by a number of genes.\n4. The scientific community agrees with the fact that we must tread cautiously when it comes to gene editing in humans. Of course, the current gene editing tools are not 100% efficient -  not all cells may be edited, and off-target effects may occur. This is why science continues to improve gene editing tools. For example, the CRISPR you mentioned has been modified for use in base editing, prime editing, and PASTE. Many agree that the \"CRISPR twins\" you are referring to is a case of genetic enhancement, but not treatment of a disease - this is what triggered the widespread condemnation and incarceration of the scientist involved. For now, somatic gene editing to treat diseases such as sickle cell is being experimented on -  and that should be it!",

    "postText": "Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Engineering, Mathematics, Computer Science**\n\nDo you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: \"What would happen if...\", \"How will the future...\", \"If all the rules for 'X' were different...\", \"Why does my...\".\n\n**Asking Questions:**\n\nPlease post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.\n\n**Answering Questions:**\n\nPlease only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.\n\nIf you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).\n\nPast AskAnythingWednesday posts [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27meta%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).

If you look at the top and bottom of this fraction, as x goes to infinity, both the top and bottom go to infinity. But, since e^(x) gets larger so much faster than x^(2) does, you say f(x) -&gt; infinity. So here you can say e^(x) is a *larger* infinity than x^(2). \n\nBut if instead you switched it and did something like\n\nf(x) = log(x)/x^(3) here both log(x) and x^(3) go to infinity, but since x^(3) grows so much faster than log(x), in this case f(x) -&gt; 0. So here, log(x) is a *smaller* infinity than x^(3). \n\nAnd finally, if you said\n\nf(x) = 2x^(2)/x^(2), well now the limit as x-&gt; infinity is 2, since of course both the top and bottom go to infinity, but the top one is always exactly 2 times larger than the bottom. Since there is a limit, then 2x^(2) is the *same size* of infinity as x^(2).",

Importantly, there's a proper class of Alephs - the number of Alephs is greater than any Aleph (i.e. there isn't really a 'number' of Alephs, there are necessarily *too many to count*). \n\nThe idea of infinities being equivalence classes of the relation (f ~ g) iff lim(f/g) exists is kind of interesting, I can't say I ever saw it before. In that sense, I would question its usefulness when discussing 'types of infinity' since it doesn't map neatly onto common notions (extended reals, ordinals, cardinals). Note also that for this notion of 'infinity' there are (at least) continuum many 'sizes', since when r &lt; r', then lim_{x -&gt; \u221e}(e^(rx)/e^(r'x)) = +\u221e. So you get a different size for every real number, and famously there are more real numbers than Aleph_0.",

For an infinite set 'S' that is countable, there exists a bijection between the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ...) and S.  Examples of other countably infinite sets include integers (..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...), and rational numbers (any number that can be expressed as a fraction with integers in the numerator and denominator).  Uncountably infinite sets are so zany we lose the axiom of choice when discussing them, meaning we lose the ability to differentiate one object in the set from others (though certain distinctions can still be made).  A classic example of an uncountably infinite set is the Cantor set (worth a quick check on Wikipedia), or the set of all real numbers (rational numbers plus everything in between, so including square roots, pi, e, and an uncountably infinite set of others).  \n\n\nSo, two.

You can't generally combine plastic types for the process, so you'd have to sort out all the types when plastic is recycled. This works (manually) if the plastic is labeled as to what type it is, if it's scraps and unlabeled it's much more difficult. Then you'd have to sort by color and then you could recycle it. \n\nRealistically it's much more expensive to do it that way and you lose an element of quality control. Unless it's recycled in the factory it's made / used in.\n\nIt's much more useful to recycle plastic in a general sense for a product that can be an indeterminate type of plastic (a compressed block for a foundation for instance).\n\nIf / when oil gets very expensive you may see new technologies develop that make it easier to recycle. Or it may be made from something besides oil.",

But most engineering around CPUs is not really thinking specifically about transistors either, but higher level structures. A nand gate is basically just a couple transistors, so at that point you're basically at the silicon anyway.\n\nSome engineers are of course working in the silicon fab on the actual packing on the silicon, like how to pack more things onto the wafer (disc of silicon that is the standard unit of silicon labs use), but still, mostly they're thinking either about packing the circuits on the wafer, or shrinking the circuit, not shrinking the transistor. The transistor size is fundamentally determined by the equipment they have access to.\n\nBut anyway, fundamentally, the CPU is comprised of a bunch of smaller but not completely trivial integrated circuits (ICs) that define the most basic things the computer can do. They are things that add numbers, or write a value to a block of memory, or shift some bits over. \n\nThose instructions are themselves made of simpler logic gates, and those logic gates are made of transistors. The course starts with nand, because you can build every other logic gate with nand.\n\nIf you have certain kinds of collections of those ICs, you can write a set of instructions that each use those ICs, and then you can expose an interface to the rest of the computer for using those instructions. A CPU is fundamentally an implementation of an instruction set that the rest of the computer can then integrate with.\n\nYou probably heard about the big fuss with the MacBook M1 CPU a couple years ago, because it benchmarked so well.\n\nThe key innovation there was not packing transistors differently, but that they used a different and much smaller instruction set than was normally used in a mass produced laptop, referred to as RISC, or reduced instruction set computing.",

Any physical means of doing this requires *at least* as much energy as the magnets have already lost.",

However, that means the magnets lose that much mechanical energy (the sum of their potential and kinetic energies). They will have less kinetic energy available to continue the cycle.\n\n&gt;Like theoretically could you not set up a system where a magnet is always pulling or pushing another magnet and have that in something like a rotational track?\n\nIn theory, you can technically do exactly this, but *only* this. That is to say, you can theoretically set up some arrangement of magnets that will continue in, yes, perpetual motion. However, it's impossible to extract any energy from the system without affecting its state. The First Law of Thermodynamics guarantees it.\n\nThe *Second* Law of Thermodynamics implies the energy of the system will be less useful over time; it will degrade into heat or noise, the magnets slowly demagnetize, etc.\n\nOf course, these aren't especially satisfying answers. They rarely are, but they hold true in all cases and are a good way to check whether what you're looking at is feasible.\n\nAs far as the nuts and bolts of *why*, the more detailed answer is that you've set up a theoretical four-step process.\n\n1. The magnets accelerate toward each other and convert potential energy to kinetic energy.\n\n2. The magnets are reoriented to repel each other.\n\n3. The magnets repulse, converting the potential of the opposing magnetic force into kinetic energy.\n\n4. The magnets are reoriented to attract once again.\n\nStep 2 is the crucial step, and the one where the exercise unfortunately breaks down.\n\nIf you bring two magnets close together, you'll notice not only do they attract (or repel), they exert a torque on each other. Each magnet will attempt to rotate to align with the other's field, and will strongly resist attempts to turn them any other way.\n\nIn step 2, the stage where the two magnets are closest (and the forces are at their strongest), your setup will need to rotate the magnets against this torque. This requires either inputting energy, or using their existing kinetic energy. I can guarantee that the kinetic energy created by steps 1 and 3 cannot exceed the amount you need to reinvest in step 2.",

Instead, the magnetic field gets weaker and goes multipolar...multiple north and south regions appear across the globe.

We can watch the stars and tell that the north pole has not stopped pointing at the north star)\n\nThirdly, we can check climate during past reversals.

Many hotspots are fed by plumes of hot rock from the mantle, as attested to by their apparent \"motion\" across the surface which is, in fact, due to the motion of the crust as these hotspots remain static. Given how distinct hotspot trails often are, you would think there'd be some trace of them effectively swapping over to their antipodes every ~65,000 years\n\n2. The crust flipping north-south would effectively swap the direction of earth's rotation relative to geographical features on the surface. Some presumably bored climatologists have [modelled earth's climate with rotation flipped](https://esd.copernicus.org/articles/9/1191/2018/) and the result is rather distinct from the current one. We have various geological and paleontological indicators for past climates and they don't indicate any such dramatic rearrangement of the global climate on a regular cycle like this.\n\n3. More fundamentally, I think you vastly overestimate how distinct the crust and mantle are. The mantle isn't just a sea of magma, it's mostly solid itself, just under enough heat and pressure to very gradually flow; you would expect immense friction if you tried to move the whole crust so rapidly, especially given how variable the crust-mantle boundary is; the ocean crust is often under 10 km deep, but the continents can get to 200 km deep, and we have detected some sections of subducting crust descending to over 600 km deep (given the rates at which crust subducts, the lowermost portions of these subducting \"slabs\" must have subducted something like 100 million years ago, so we can be pretty sure they haven't snapped off or something recently).",

So you take the set of numbers, introduce a new concept and see what you get.\n\nSo in a purely mathematical sense complex numbers are no less \"natural\" than others. In fact, since complex numbers are algebraically complete you could look at them as the most \"natural\" set of numbers.\n\nAlso complex numbers have actual meanings in quantum mechanics, as the states of objects can be complex.

It's even more uncertain when the small-scale concept hasn't been proven yet. We don't know whether fusion can be stabilized into a continuous process, with the potential to replace gas, coal, and fission power. We don't know what it will take for fusion to produce enough power to actually replace gas/coal/fission.\n\nBut, for scale-up, there are usually a few things to consider. First, the cost of materials, construction, and a place to put the thing. Second, the cost of adapting the existing power transport infrastructure to handle a new input. Third, the cost of actually operating a fusion plant compared to a gas/coal/fission plant. Fourth, the legal and regulatory context surrounding the new technology and the old technology. Some examples of legal and regulatory issues could include public safety, environmental concerns, and national security. It's hard to predict how the issues with this hypothetical fusion process would compare against the issues with existing gas/coal/fission plants. I'm sure there are more things to consider that I haven't listed.\n\nIssues like those would slow down adoption. But, incentives could overcome some of those issues. For example, public policy aimed at installing fusion plants. In any case, it's hard to predict how quickly fusion would be adopted.",

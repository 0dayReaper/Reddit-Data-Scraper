    "postText": "Nitrogen is converted from a free elemental gaseous form to usable forms such as ammonia in a process called \"fixation\". This process is mostly performed by soil bacteria, and to a lesser degree also happens in a few other places including lightning.\n\nAre there any natural processes that go the other direction, converting bound nitrogen back to free nitrogen? I assume fire probably does this, but I'm wondering if there are any other processes.",

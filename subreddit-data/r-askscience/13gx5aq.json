Chimpanzees make just as much milk as we do, but their chests are flat except when they're nursing, and even then only swell slightly. Boobs are mostly fat, which doesn't seem to do anything but look nice to potential mates.\n\nAnd from the masculine side of things, women can survive just fine in the wilderness alone, with their natural levels of strength and size. So why exactly do males need to be, on average, 7% taller and 61% more muscular? All that mass costs more energy to maintain, and is unnecessary for our survival. It appears that the reason we have it is mostly to show off. To compete with other males for female attention. Our voices are also lower, arbitrarily. There's no reason, survival-wise, that men and women couldn't have the same average pitch. But a deep loud voice makes us seem tough to girls.\n\nBasically, boobs and being buff are the human equivalents of peacocking.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, there's also some evidence that human intelligence may be a result of sexual selection.\n\nAt some point, we became intelligent enough to be free of basically all other selection pressures. We were able to easily outsmart prey and predator, make tools to rapidly adapt to new situations and endure basically all environmental conditions. In our native habitat, and with our newfound intellect, food was plentiful and serious threats were few.\n\nBut then we kept going.\n\nWe don't need to be able to do mathematics or write books or perform brain surgery to survive as a species. Heck, we don't even really need to use language. We would be doing just fine without those things, and a brain that is capable of those things is expensive.\n\nWe have since discovered all these capabilities are useful to a certain way of life that we now live, quite recently in the grand scheme of things. But we had the mental capacity to do them two million years ago, before we ever needed or wanted to, or even knew they were possible. It's possible that the reason we got so smart was, again, to show off.",

That animals use it to show off is to prevent unnecessary fights with all the risks involved. \n\nWithout language we would be on the same level as the great apes and maybe have decimated them like we did now, but we would never have been this successful.

Given that hominid brains evolve quite slowly, given their complexity, I don't think it's a stretch to assume humans of the era were approximately as intelligent as humans now. \n\"Successful\" gets hard to define once you get to a certain level. Yes, it's true, we dominate the planet now, but no other species in history has ever done so to this degree. Does that mean no other species in history has ever succeeded, evolutionarily? \nMy point is not that language is not useful, it certainly is. My point is that we didn't need language to thrive as much as or even more than any species before us. There was no survival pressure to evolve language because, by the time we did, we already lived in abundance. Given that, it's likely the motivation for language was mostly sexual.\n\nWhile it's true muscle can be used for defense, the truth is in humans it rarely is. Interspecies combat is trivialized by tools. And using our strength to fight other humans doesn't actually improve the fitness of our species. It has no survival advantage, only a sexual one, which is precisely the same as a peacocks tale. Where large size and strength is useful for survival, in mammals, it's almost universally the case that both sexes take advantage of that size. In animals that are highly dimorphic in that regard, like humans, size typically provides only a sexual advantage.\nPicture, for example, lions. Male lions are bigger and stronger than females, but females don't need to be that size to successfully hunt down prey. And in fact, the males rarely participate in such hunts, when part of a pride. Their size is for sex and sex only.\n\nAnd regarding voices, while male voices would be deeper as a virtue of our larger size, yes, they would not be as deep as they are now. During puberty, male voices \"drop\" as the larynx expands dramatically, and disproportionately to the rest of the body. There's no mechanical reason for it to be so large as it is, or our voices so deep. Evolution selected for deeper voices without any survival advantage. Which means again, the selection most have been sexual.\n\nThe distinction is important here, because that was the original question. Why do peacocks have big tails when it doesn't help them survive? And the follow up comment, do humans have similar features? Sexual selection is the name of the game, and it operates by very different rules than survival of the fittest.",

There weren\u2019t many options to determine fitness to lead, so that\u2019s what was used. If you could trounce the local males, then you could maybe kill a coyote that threatened the babies.

And I am speculating mind you. \n\nBut if there is a correlation between volume and the number or size of milk ducts, even a little bit, I could see a larger visible volume being a signal of fitness. This could go even beyond postnatal or prenatal periods and it might have had a stronger correlation in previous Homo species than it does in the current extant one.. So therefore could have been a target of selective pressure for mate selection. So like a peacocks feathers, it wouldn\u2019t make a lot of sense in the way it has eventually become, but had roots in some actual fitness measurement at some point. Sort of an arms race thing that gets ridiculous after a few iterations. Even if in many species of mammal the size of mammary glands doesn\u2019t really matter when it comes down to it\u2026",

There's no way for a woman to know if she will produce adequate quantities of milk until it comes down to the baby is here and now wants to be fed.  Some women can never make an adequate supply, some women make enough for multiples even when they only have one, etc.",

As a species we've more or less evolved past the need for physical strength. Obviously it's still a very very useful quality and its far more beneficial to have it than not and it allows us to get MORE done faster, but if everyone's muscle mass suddenly halved overnight society wouldn't collapse and we wouldn't starve cause we have technology and infrastructure to make up the difference.\n\nAnd then of course there's all the parallels between physical fitness and sperm count / overall fertility.\n\nThough I think its more the fact that those traits were entirely necessary to our survival at one point and evolution just doesnt work that fast. Realistically most of our technological advancements in regard to 'artificial strength' have come about in the last 200 years. The human race of 3000 may look very different to how it does now.\n\nCome to think of it, this is lileky why 'advanced future humans' in sci fi are always depicted as mostly slender.

But even then, even millions of years ago, I don't think our massive size difference was that helpful to survival.\n\nIn species that do \"need\" to be a certain size to survive, males and females are usually similar in size, such as in wolves.\nMeanwhile, in highly dimorphic species, like humans, size difference typically provides a sexual advantage, not a survival one.\n\nTake lions, for example. Female lions are smaller than males, but are perfectly able to hunt prey. They didn't need to be as big as the males to do so. Which means the males don't need to be so big to do so. In fact, male lions rarely hunt prey at all, in prides, meaning their mass is not even a little helpful to the survival of the group. A male lion's size is used entirely to fight other males. Not to protect the group and help his females survive, but to protect his access to the females. A purely sexual motivation.",

The handicap hypotheses\nTo grow the tail every year requires resources (nutrient etc), by doing so the male is advertising to the female how evolutionarily fit he is, that he has the resources to spare to grow such a detrimental feature. Therefore if the female mates with him, her offspring will have a better chance of survival because of the genes they inherit from him. Its considered to be an \"honest signal\" because it cannot be faked (an unhealthy male cannot grow so long a tail with so many eyes since he doesn't have the spare nutrients, they are needed for basic metabolic mantinance).\n\n2. The sexy-son hypothesis \nThe female chooses the male who appeals most to her, he will pass this trait onto at least some of her sons, which the next generation of females will also find super appealing and therefor male with him, giving thr first female more grandchildren.\n\nThe thing to remember is that reproduction in this context such as this is all about getting the maximum number of offspring who survive to have the maximum number of offspring of their own. Thus a male who survives only one breeding season but mates with 10 females will have done better from an evolutionary point of view than a male who survives five breeding seasons but mates with only one female per season. The female wants thr healthiest offspring possible so they are more likely to survive to breed themselves, this then factors into female choice in systems where that is the method of mate choice (rather than male combat as in lions or deer).\n\nIn reality it is probably a combination of reasons why the system has evolved and it is also worth noting it is the cost to the male that presents the peacocks tail becoming any longer. It would become too much of a handicap and cause him to die before he could breed, therefore preventing this extra-long tail gene variants from been passed on.",

            "comment": "As others have said the bright feathers are a sign of fitness in that individual making it more likely he will mate. At the same time those bright feathers make him more susceptible to predators so what is going on? In the case of Peacocks the male is needed for mating and making babies basically. So the males have a tradeoff, brighter colors to attract a mate and have offspring vs. living a potentially longer life as a bland brown male and not producing offspring. But here is the thing, you don't need one male for every female. One or a small group of males can do a lot of mating. So imagine 50% of the males got eaten due to their colors. Well that leaves the other 50% of males who can do all the mating that is needed. Basically you can lose a bunch of males to predators and still have the females producing offspring just like before. For males the chance to mate and reproduce is evolutionarily more important for the species than some fraction of the males becoming prey due to colors. The males are sort of more disposable if you will, but only up to a point of course. Enough manage to survive so that mating occurs and that is all that is needed. Note this is not the case in all species as things like Bald Eagles for example the male and female work together to raise and provide for the young. One of the eagles will sit on the eggs while the other hunts and brings back food. If the male was lost in that scenario then the chances of those eggs hatching and all becoming adults is lower. Not too surprisingly the male and female Bald Eagles look like each other with mainly a difference in size.\n\nAs to why this is just how they evolved. Many species have ways of displaying maturity and fitness in males. The females need to be able to identify some signal from a male that signifies they are off good genetic stock and are physically healthy. This can be done in different ways such as bright colors, a mating dance, or males just physically fighting to see who is the strongest among others. As long as the females get impregnated the species continues on in this evolutionary arms race. However if the Peacock male's colors became such a survival burden that so many are preyed on females could not find a mate, something would change or they would go extinct (in an extreme case). And sometimes that can happen. Species go extinct when some other species comes along that, say, eats all their food, kills all their males or whatever. Or if there is time they may adapt and change. Maybe the males in that case would become brown like the females over time but now the males would do a dance to show fitness. It can happen if there is enough time, but sometimes there isn't and species disappear. So far the Peacocks seem to be surviving and doing fine with the way things are now so there is no evolutionary push for them to change.",

Typically it is the female as they are the one that invests more of their energy into the reproductive process and raising the young (though there are many exceptions).\n\nThe choosy sex decides on which specimen to mate with based on how good their genes are.  How do they figure that out?  First, the bare minimum standard is they are still alive at the age of maturity.  This may seem trivial but it is a foundation for all logical leaps going forward.  It indicates their parentage (both genetically and in their nurturing) was at least adequate.  Second, how apparently good are they at surviving in the hostile environment that is Nature?  Well fed, strong, healthy specimens with good behaviours are free from parasites, larger than average, symmetrically featured and excel in their base abilities.\n\nMost mammals demonstrate their fitness through physical exertion.  Being bigger, stronger, tougher.  Fighting and the size of fighting tools decide who is the better mate.  Birds don't have this luxury.  Physics demands they be lightweight in order to fly so they have hollow bones and their maximum size is limited.  Fighting is not an option when a simple peck easily breaks something which is almost 100% lethal.  Displays become the deciding factor in the bird kingdom (for the most part).\n\nMale birds will have bright plummage.  Strong Colouration is a result of good nutrition and lack of parasites/disease.  Not only that but it is an obvious disadvantage as they are more visible.  **They are so good at surviving they are still alive despite the handicap**.\n\nTaking all this in, whoever has the brightest, largest display wins.  They get to mate, and have their genes passed on to the next generation.  The puny ones don't (again as always, there are exceptions like trickery and deception, rape, etc...).  Continue this trend for hundreds of generations and you can get ridiculous results like birds with tails that weigh as much as the rest of the body.  Doesn't matter because they survived until reproductive age.\n\nThis has been demonstrated in birds with much less elaborate tail displays.  Scientists take the male, strap on a giant tail so large the poor thing can't fly and all the females come running and choose him every time.",

And although the gene pool is benefiting from the positive change, neither the gene, or the peacock know or care about the gene pool. All they are doing is trying to ensure that their gene gets passed down. \n\nI haven\u2019t studied peacocks specifically but my suspicion is that the gene pool is benefitted by the mutation of magnificent plumage by having more babies than the loss to the pool by being easier to hunt. They obviously haven\u2019t been hunted to extinction and they do look rather fetching. \n\nThough I still prefer [Argus the all seeing](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argus_Panoptes) as an explanation.",

            "comment": "It's a conspicuous consumption thing.\n\nBasically, the peacocks are so successful that just surviving isn't impressive anymore. So the peacocks evolved the giant, bad for flight, conspicuous feathers as a way to show off how good they are at survival.\n\nThe feathers are big enough to make flight a serious problem, and the peacocks spend a lot of time and effort on the feathers. That's time and energy basically wasted in nothing (that is directly good for survival). So the feathers are a way for the peacocks to tell the females that they are so good at growing / finding food / evading predators that they can afford to have giant impractical feathers, and can afford to spend the time and effort required to keep those feathers shiny and new.",

It\u2019s  like they get attracted by the fact they underestimate that risk\u2026 And this is why females prefer these big and pompous males.",

            "comment": "Ronald Fisher, the English biologist, developed a number of ideas concerning secondary characteristics in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, including the concept of Fisherian runaway which postulates that the desire for a characteristic in females combined with that characteristic in males can create a positive feedback loop or runaway where the feature becomes hugely amplified. The 1975 handicap principle extends this idea, stating that a peacock's tail, for instance, displays fitness by being a useless impediment that is very hard to fake.  \n.  \nSource: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary\\_sex\\_characteristic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_sex_characteristic)  \n\n\nBUT...\n\n  \nThese two explanations\u2014the \"good genes\u201d and the \"bright beacons\u201d-have in common the view that ornate displays have evolved because they're useful\u2014they signify quality or draw attention to a courting male.   \nBut there's another perspective, says Stoddard, more controversial but deeply intriguing. The hummingbird's flamboyant dive may have evolved for a more capricious reason: \u201cSimply because it's beautiful!\u201d she exclaims. \u201cAnd females love it, and that's enough to create selection pressure for aesthetically pleasing things.\"   \nMaybe, as Emerson said, beauty is its own excuse for being.   \nThe notion that complex displays have evolved for purely aesthetic reasons-not because they're objectively informative but because they're subjectively pleasing to the chooser-is an old one, dating back to Darwin and developed by geneticist Ronald Fisher a century ago. Over generations, said Fisher, extreme traits and the desire for them could coevolve, leading to \u201cFisherian runaway selection.\u201d Two scientists have recently revived these ideas, Michael Ryan, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Texas at Austin, and Richard Prum, an ornithologist at Yale. In his book The Evolution of Beauty, Prum revisits Darwin's idea and rebrands it the \"beauty happens\u201d hypothesis. Females develop an arbitrary fondness for certain aesthetic male traits, even if they aren't informative-an acrobatic dive, a set of flamboyant feathers, a fluorescent bill, a buzzing tail feather. Their offspring inherit the traits they consider beautiful and sexy, as well as the penchant for them, and then these traits spread through a population through runaway selection.   \nIn other words, male broad-tailed hummingbirds dive, flash, and buzz not to show off their genetic quality, but because females like what they see.   \n\"When Ben and I discussed the broad-tail's diving display with Rick,\" says Stoddard, \"he said he believed that the stunning dive\u2013with its tight synchrony and mash-up of multiple sensory features-could certainly have evolved simply because females found it beautiful and sexy.

    "postText": "Long story short, I'm trying to win an argument with my partner. I firmly believe that wearing clothes every night to bed is causing more acne and skin effects than sleeping with less clothing would otherwise cause.  \n\nI'm trying to see if I can find a research paper focusing on dermalogical effects of sleeping with clothing but have had no luck so far. Everything I'm finding relates to temperature regulation and sleep quality.",

            "comment": "tl;dr I think you will find it difficult to (a) link any textile or clothing to acne and (b) somehow further link night time effects on long-term skin conditions to that clothing or textile.\n\n*Pruritus* is a common and significant symptom of acne.  It's fancy words for \"itchy\".\n\nAbout half of all people with acne report they [experience itching and they scratch their acne lesions](https://www.medicaljournals.se/acta/content/html/10.2340/00015555-0355).\n\n*Nocturnal pruritus* is itchy skin that worsens at night due to hormonal changes, dehydration and natural fluctuations in body temperature.  Not usually linked to clothing or textiles, however, really incredibly simply easy to link \"hormone changes\" to acne.\n\nOverall: some people are primed to worsen their skin conditions overnight.\n\nMoving on to clothes and bedding.\n\n*Contact dermititis* is linked to clothing and textiles.  Any fibre can cause some people to worsen a skin condition.  It's the itchy skin you get from itchy wool, tight-fitting polyester clothing that gives you a sweat rash, unexpected skin conditions when you change laundry detergent.\n\n*irritant dermatitis* is most often linked to tight-fitting fabric and sweat.\n\n*Textile related dermatitis* (and other skin effects) are most often related to synthetic clothing that doesn't breathe as well as cotton or breathable fibres, but it can be literally any fibre you can think of that affects some people.\n\nSkin microbiome (e.g. bacteria on your outsides).\n\nEveryone has dust mites in their bedding.  Everyone.  However, [at low concentrations dust mites in bedding appear to be beneficial to human health](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-020-00895-w). \n\n[Clothing and skin microbiome are related.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8226598/)",

Some less breathable type of pillows eg latex might have some effect? Some effects would be about temperature regulation &amp; how easy it is for your body to maintain a comfortable temp without undue sweeting (being sweaty would likely encourage bacteria).",

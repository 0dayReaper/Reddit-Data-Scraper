I'm just curious.  \n\nSay a person is severely drunk on alcohol, or say something more intense such as heroin.  Would it harm/kill the mosquito?  How much would a person have to consume to achieve mosquito lethality?",

            "comment": "Even at 0.5% BAC, the alcohol would likely be too dilute to affect the mosquito. Biologically, mosquitoes also process the fluid in a gut pouch before it interacts with other body systems so there's potential the alcohol would be broken down beforehand. Insect neurology is very far from my field so this is conjecture, but I would wonder if mosquitoes even have GABA receptors for ethanol.\n\nUltimately though everything is a poison at the right concentration. Alcohol vapor can definitely kill mosquitoes.\n\nInterestingly enough, I found a [paper on ivermectin mass drug administrations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22493855/) killing mosquitoes that bite humans which makes sense given we [similarly poison our pets to prevent disease/infestations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milbemycin_oxime).",

            "comment": "Only female mosquitoes drink blood, and only when they're growing eggs. The rest of the time, one thing they like to feed on is fruit juice. Now, most fruits, and especially their juices, naturally contain a bit of alcohol. An alcohol content of 0.5% is not unusual. So just from that fact alone, we can surmise that mosquitoes can safely consume liquids with an alcohol concentration of around 0.5%.\n\nNow, consider that a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.4% is potentially fatal to humans. For comparison, the legal driving limit is around 0.05% in most countries, and the average person drinking one standard drink will see their BAC go up to about 0.02-0.03%. So that tells you that even someone drinking dangerous amounts will struggle to hit a BAC that exceeds the alcohol content of fruit juice. \n\nSo in short: no, a mosquito is very unlikely to experience any harmful effects from the tiny concentrations of alcohol that can be found in the blood of an intoxicated person.",

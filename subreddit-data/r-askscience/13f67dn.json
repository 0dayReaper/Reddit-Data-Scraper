            "comment": "First, whales do get the bends.  During tests of high powered military sonar, whales have raced for the surface too quickly to get away from painfully loud sounds, later beached themselves and died, and autopsies have been consistent with decompression sickness or the bends.\n\nIt\u2019s very difficult to get the bends from breath hold diving.  If you take a lungful of air at the surface and descend 100 feet, the pressure on your chest will compress your lungs to a fourth the size they were at the surface.  Even though the air in your lungs is pressurized and four times as much nitrogen could theoretically dissolve into your blood, there\u2019s just not that much nitrogen available compared to the volume of your blood, so you never saturate nitrogen into your blood.  You\u2019ll get more nitrogen into your blood than on the surface, but you\u2019ll run out of nitrogen before your blood runs out of the ability to absorb nitrogen.  You have to ascend very, very quickly before that small amount of nitrogen comes out of solution quickly enough to cause the bends.  Unfortunately, some whales can swim upwards fast enough to count as \u201cvery, very quickly\u201d and get the bends.\n\nIf you breathe pressurized air from a SCUBA tank while 100 feet down, each breath has four times as much nitrogen as a breath at the surface, and you can take multiple breaths.  The amount of nitrogen is no longer the limit. With every breath more and more nitrogen is added until you get to saturation after thousands of breaths.  With thousands of times more nitrogen dissolved in your blood, SCUBA divers have to ascend far more slowly than breath hold divers.",

                    "comment": "You are (almost entirely) correct. For the vast majority of people who are just diving while holding their breath and then returning to the surface, it's impossible for them to suffer from the bends because there isn't time for pressurized air (which exists in the lungs even when breath holding) to drive nitrogen into the body.\n\nIt is technically possible for (human) divers, breathing only at the surface, to suffer from the bends, but they have to be elite free divers who dive deep, remain there for a bit, come back up and spend no time at the surface other than taking another breath. This is because they're actually spending enough time at substantial depth for the capacity of their lungs to be enough compressed air to drive nitrogen into the body.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8446421/\n\nIt is worth noting, though, that there is at least some suggestion in the literature that animals might occasionally suffer from decompression sickness.\n\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/40454497_Decompression_sickness_in_breath-hold_divers_A_review",

            "comment": "They mitigate it by storing a lot of oxygen in the blood for dives, not in the lungs. \n\nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/why-do-whales-get-bends\n\n&gt;Researchers have suspected a link between sonar testing and whale deaths for nearly 20 years. In 2000, the U.S. Navy said its sonar exercises led six beaked whales to fatally beach themselves in the Bahamas, and stranded whales have died near sonar-testing sites in at least five other cases since then. It hasn't been clear how the sonar disorients the animals and causes such strandings, but some marine biologists suspect that the intense sound waves force whales to shoot to the surface, and they've found evidence that tiny nitrogen bubbles expand in the whales' tissues and damage vital organs (ScienceNOW, 9 October 2003). The same thing happens when scuba divers surface too quickly--a condition known as the bends. But a whale holds its breath when diving, preventing nitrogen buildup, so the theory didn't seem to hold water. A group led by marine biologist Peter Tyack of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts suspected that whales alter their diving behavior in some other way.\n\n&gt;Whales make repeated shallow dives when trying to evade predators. The team wondered whether such behavior could be risky, especially because naval sonar--which is similar in frequency to the calls of the beaked whale's most feared adversary, the killer whale--could be forcing the whales to adopt a similar diving pattern. So the researchers mathematically analyzed dive behavior in Cuvier's beaked whales and in dolphins to test whether nitrogen bubbles could expand in whale tissue during repeated shallow dives. The team incorporated known physiological data into a model that charts how the bubble size might increase in the circulatory system, brain, muscles, and fat tissues when a whale dives repeatedly to between 30 and 80 meters for as long as 3 hours.\n\n&gt;During normal diving behavior, scientists believe, the lungs of marine mammals collapse when they plunge past 72 meters in depth. That \"clever mechanism,\" Tyack says, prevents nitrogen from infiltrating the bloodstream. The team's model predicts that if the whales' lungs do not collapse during a long series of shallow dives, the increased pressure can cause nitrogen bubbles to diffuse into tissues, increasing the risk of bubble formation on ascent. Limiting the duration of sonar testing may prevent the animals from diving in these harmful patterns, the team concludes in the current issue of Marine Mammal Science.\n\n&gt;Noting that diving behavior is extraordinarily difficult to study in live animals, marine biologist Terrie Williams of the University of California, Santa Cruz, calls the model \"extremely useful.\" As new research shores up gaps in the model's assumptions--with actual observations to corroborate the avoidance behavior, for example--scientists can try to home in on a safe length and level of sonar exercises, clarifying the murky waters surrounding this debate. \"Now it's a question of how quickly [decompression sickness] happens,\" she says.\n\nSo, they have mechanisms to prevent the bends like lungs collapsing, but if they are forced to surface quickly they can fail.\n\nhttps://baleinesendirect.org/en/can-whales-experience-the-bends-like-divers-do/\n\nTheir fat reserves also somewhat mitigate the issue. \n\n&gt;Researchers from the University of North Carolina Wilmington investigated how marine mammals\u2019 tissues\u2014specifically, fat deposits in the jaws of toothed whales that are used in echolocation\u2014absorb nitrogen gas, one of the gases that contributes to the bends. They found that the makeup of the fat affected how much nitrogen gas dissolves in it\u2014and that different species had different fat compositions.\n\n&gt;Once, scientists thought that diving sea creatures like the elusive, deep-diving Cuvier\u2019s beaked whale were resistant to the bends, but mounting evidence suggests that this may not be entirely true.\n\n&gt;In 2002, international navy sonar exercises were linked to a mass stranding of 14 whales in the Canary islands. The whales had gas bubbles in their tissues, a sign of decompression sickness.\n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2014.00013/full\n\nDeep sea diving has its own issues. \n\n&gt;In summary we have identified three main risk factors that potentially explain why deep divers have an elevated risk of developing gas bubble embolism compared to shallow divers:\n\n&gt;(1) The longer duration dives combined with exercise during dives will increase the tissue CO2-levels, and this could initiate bubble growth in a supersaturated body.\n\n&gt;(2) Deep divers may spend more time in the intermediate (compression) zone where N2 is absorbed during descent and ascent.\n\n&gt;(3) The longer duration of deep dives allows for transfer of N2 from fast to slow tissues (e.g., fat), which leads to N2 accumulation.\n\nAnd this leads to behaviour like them surfacing even when food is plentiful. \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15618509/\n\n&gt;Diving mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and humans develop dysbaric osteonecrosis from end-artery nitrogen embolism (\"the bends\") in certain bones. Sixteen sperm whales from calves to large adults showed a size-related development of osteonecrosis in chevron and rib bone articulations, deltoid crests, and nasal bones. Occurrence in animals from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans over 111 years made a pathophysiological diagnosis of dysbarism most likely.\n\nAnd if you examine normal whales you can see damage from the bends in their bones, indicating that it's something that is ongoing but not a fatal thing generally.",

They have a huge amount of hemoglobin and myoglobin to store the need oxygen in their blood. They don\u2019t keep the nitrogen that can go gaseous giving you the bends and don\u2019t suffer from pure oxygen toxicity at depth unlike humans.",

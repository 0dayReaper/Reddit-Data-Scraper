Even in forward motion there is gravity so why is it that all items in the plane aren\u2019t being thrown backwards into the tail? Even the water bottle next to me on a flat counter does not go back with the forward motion? And if this phenomenon is imperceptible, in the training scenarios for pilots, when they test high G-forces in a lab, do the people even feel the speed or is it the physiological effects only (i.e. hypotension, blood shifts, facial changes, etc)?",

            "comment": "One thing to always keep in mind- accelerations are perceived, velocities are not. G's is a measure of acceleration (aka, 1 G is the same acceleration that you feel standing on the surface of the Earth, 2Gs is twice that amount). So, going back to your airplane, you feel the accelerations- when the plane is taking off, you're pushed back into your seat, and when it's landing, you are pushed forward. That's because when you take off and land, you're accelerating (going from standstill to 435 mph/going from 435 mph to stand still). Pilots in high-G training do feel it all- they are undergoing high acceleration, not just high speed. \n\nThe reason a lot of people think they feel speed is because normally when you're going fast, you're moving fast compared to your surroundings, and so you are feeling a lot of resistance. For instance, if you're driving in a car, you don't \"feel\" the speed. But if you were to keep driving and open the sunroof and stand up, you would suddenly feel that speed. What's happening? In the car, you're moving at the same speed as your surroundings, so you don't notice. When you stand up out of the sunroof, now you're moving in relation to your surroundings, so you feel all the air (and bugs) hitting you.",

It's all relative, if you have an object in space moving at half the speed of light past you, then you could also perceive it as you moving at half the speed of light and that object is stationary.

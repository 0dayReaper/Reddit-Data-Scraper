            "comment": "Hmm, lots of incomplete answers here.\n\nTake a look at [this graph](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth103/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.earth103/files/module03/fig8sol.png) of solar intensity vs latitude.  As you can see, the summer pole receives about as much sunlight as the equator (actually, slightly more because of the 24-hour days in the arctic circle!).  On the other hand, there's a huge difference in energy provided to the equator vs the completely dark winter pole.   As a result, there's a huge difference in temperature between the winter pole and the equator, and not so much between the summer pole and equator.\n\nBut that just explains changes in temperature vs *latitude*, not changes over time, so let's think about weather systems.  Storms are created by the north-south temperature gradient: as heat moves from equator to pole, a small amount of it is converted into kinetic energy.  Heat flow causes motion, just like a very inefficient steam or gasoline engine.  When the temperature difference is large, the \"engine\" runs faster and more efficiently, creating more kinetic energy -- which is to say the storm winds blow stronger when the pole-equator temperature difference is large.\n\nSo.  In the wintertime, the difference in solar heating creates a much larger equator-pole temperature difference than in the summer.  This creates much stronger wind patterns.  So you've got stronger winds, blowing a bigger temperature gradient around across the surface of the Earth ... so you see much bigger temperature shifts from day to day.\n\nEdited to add some examples.  Here are views of temperatures and winds at the 500 mbar level [in northern hemisphere summer](https://earth.nullschool.net/#2017/08/19/1800Z/wind/isobaric/500hPa/overlay=temp/orthographic=-66.65,42.29,316) (last August 19) and [northern hemisphere winter](https://earth.nullschool.net/#2018/02/19/1800Z/wind/isobaric/500hPa/overlay=temp/orthographic=-66.65,42.29,316) (yesterday).  Colors indicate temperature contrast (purple is colder), streaks indicate wind direction and speed.",

Instead, national and world weather maps were faxed every 4 hours to thousands of sites around the US by the National Weather Service. Receiving sites had to have a fax machine printing operating 24/7.\n\nA guy in our department had the primary job of pulling the faxes out -- 30 or 40 with each cycle -- and mounting them up on a big board in our main lobby. He even had to mount the ones received overnight, because in order to see weather trends you had to flip through the last 24 or 48 hours of maps. That's how we produced an \"animated\" weather map.",

Even if the Earth had no Coriolis force, the wind patterns and heat transport would look very different, but temperature advection would still be greater in winter than summer.",

On a cool night, the temperature will often drop to the dew point or a little below, and dew will drop out of the air.  A phase change from water vapor to liquid water entails removing a larger amount of energy than just changing the temperature, and so the temperature tends to stop dropping fast when it hits the dew point.  \n\nIf the temperature had been able to drop lower overnight, the next day wouldn't get nearly as warm and could be like a winter day.\n\nDeserts typically get colder at night than similarly warm humid places.  Part of that is the lack of cloud cover but part of of it also the lack of this dew point clamping effect.",

Arctic winters don't have warm winter days like in the Midwest. In the tropics it is pretty much always summer. It is hot year-round.\n\nDuring a Midwest winter sometimes the air will blow down from the north and be very cold, but sometimes it will blow from the south and be warmer. There might be a 100F difference or more between northern Canada and the equator. Cold northern winter air and warm tropical air meet in the middle and we experience some of that large temperature difference.\n\nDuring a Midwest summer, the same thing happens except that the arctic is now also experiencing summer. Northern Canada is now warmer so there might only be a 40F difference between northern Canada and the equator. The midwest still experiences some cooler air traveling down from the north, but it isn't nearly as cool, so we don't experience nearly as large a difference in temperature.\n\nThe other factor involved is exactly where the cold arctic air and the warm tropical air meet. In the winter, they meet much further south while in the summer they meet farther north. This boundary is basically the polar front jet stream, which you can see from this [diagram](https://climate.ncsu.edu/images/edu/polar_front_summer_winter.jpg) is located further south in the winter. You can view the current jet stream maps [here](http://squall.sfsu.edu/gif/jetstream_init_00.gif). You can compare that to this [map](http://www.intellicast.com/National/Temperature/Current.aspx) which shows generally warmer temperatures south of the jet stream and colder temperatures north of the jet stream.

But I'll put some basic points below:\n\nFirs, it's hard to quantify something that is kind of abstract like the phenomenon you describe, but it does have a basis in truth. [Using Chicago as an example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Chicago#Data): In January, the average temperature (not the average high or low, the average overall temperature) is 20.8F (-6.2C). The record high in January is 67F (19C) and the record low is -33F (-36C). That's a departure of +46F and -54F between the average temperature and the record highs and lows. In contrast: in July the average temperature is 71.7F (22.1C). The record July high is 111F (44C) and the record low is 40F (4C). That's a similar departure for the record high (+39F) but a much lower departure for the record low (-32F).\n\nSo what is the cause of this discrepancy? This is due to many factors, most of which are hard to explain at anything less than a college level, but I will aim for high-school level and see how I do.\n\n\n**1. Thermal radiation**\n\nThe major contributing cause has to do with the different phenomena that cause air to cool down vs warm up. Ignoring small effects, air cools down almost solely due to [thermal radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation) escaping into space. Thermal radiation is a very important phenomenon that is sadly misunderstood by many (because it is often poorly explained, even by physics teachers!), but in a nutshell, all matter, everywhere in the universe, emits [electromagnetic radiation](https://www.livescience.com/38169-electromagnetism.html), and the amount of energy it releases via this radiation goes up as the temperature goes up, and down as the temperature goes down. The earth and air are no exception, they are both constantly releasing thermal radiation, and without external sources of heat they would be constantly cooling off.\n\nIgnoring effects from clouds and the atmosphere absorbing and re-emitting the thermal radiation (these effects are not negligible, but not important to this explanation) it gets cooler at night because the ground and air are emitting thermal radiation out to space. This is a slow process, that is made even slower by the fact that as it cools down, it emits less energetic thermal radiation, so the rate of cooling slows down as the temperature drops.\n\nThis is all in contrast to the way the earth heats up: via light from the sun. Sunlight is (roughly) constant and [very energetic compared to the weak infrared radiation released by the earth and its air](http://faculty.icc.edu/easc111lab/labs/labi/waveradi.jpg). Even a very small amount of sun is enough to offset the cooling by earth's thermal radiation, so in the summer, with long sunny days and short nights, there just isn't much time for the temperatures to drop significantly.\n\n**2. Polar day vs. polar night (summer vs. winter)**\n\n*Note that the following explanation is specific to the [mid-latitudes](http://isen.northwestern.edu/sites/default/files/images/articles/2016/oct/Horton_globe_widgetLARGE2.png), which are areas which are not in the tropics and not near the north or south pole. It is also northern-hemisphere-specific, you need to flip the directions if you're in the southern hemisphere.*\n\nGoing along with the above point, it's worth pointing out that, when it's very cold out, the air that you're feeling didn't get that way just because of nighttime cooling: it's almost always because that air came from a much colder region. Cool/cold snaps, both in winter and summer, result from winds blowing from the north. Likewise, heat waves are usually due to air which originated further south, just because areas further south have the sun closer to overhead, and so the [solar heating is stronger](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/irradiance1.jpg).\n\nIn the winter, the polar regions are in a constant night, meaning that unless warmer air is pushed up from the south, the air will just continually get colder, and colder. So even though radiational cooling as explained above gets slower and slower as you get colder, this can result in **very** cold temperatures over the course of weeks and months of constant night! \n\nOn the other hand, in the summer, the northern arctic is in constant daylight. The sun is at a low angle for sure, but even this feeble heating influence is enough to counteract most of the cooling due to thermal radiation, and it means that any air pushing south to create a cold snap will start at a much higher temperature, and even if it doesn't warm up at all as it moves south (in reality it will be warming up at least a little) it just won't be the extreme, below-zero cold that is possible in the winter.\n\n**3. Humidity's restriction on cooling air**\n\nThe existence of water vapor means that heating-vs-cooling is not an even process: for all intents and purposes, you can heat air indefinitely without hitting any barriers, but if you cool off air that has some water vapor in it, eventually you will reach the dew point: the temperature at which the humidity is 100%. When you cool down to that temperature, water vapor will start to condense into a liquid (or solid), which is an exothermic (heat-releasing) process. This means that any further cooling will be much slower, because of this extra energy that is constantly being released by the condensing water.\n\nBecause average temperatures are higher in the summer, average humidities are also higher (outside of desert areas that have very little liquid water available to evaporate). This means that it is very hard to get the right circumstances in the summer to get very cold temperatures.\n\n**tl;dr: Unfortunately I really don't have one. It's a complicated subject with complicated causes. I tried to keep the above as simple as possible, go ahead and give it a try!**\n\nWell, this answer got way longer than I thought it would, and it doesn't even really come close to the full explanation I wish I could type up. But let me know if you have any follow-up questions, and I'll try to clarify things as much as possible!",

In particular, the limit on water vapor abundance increases *exponentially* with temperature, and evaporating water absorbs a large amount of latent heat.  This means when you heat and cool cold air, most of the energy just goes into changing the temperature (sensible heat), humidity is a negligible factor.   But when you heat and cool *hot* air, more of your energy goes into driving evaporation and condensation (latent heat), so changes in actual temperature will be proportionately smaller.",

Artic air is colder in the winter than it is in the summer so you don't get real cold swings in summer, Tropical air masses are basically the same temperature in winter and summer, so if it does make it to the Midwest in winter it will still be warm leading to a larger temperature swing.\n2.  The Jetstream is stronger and closer to the Midwest in the winter.\n\n\n1.  The area around the north pole goes through temperature changes.  In the winter it is really cold(about -30F), so when that cold air gets pulled down into the Midwest it is really cold and we get to deal with all the wonderful things that cold weather brings.  In the summer that artic air is much warmer(37-54F).  So even if you get air coming south from the artic in summer it is not as cold to begin with and with much more energy being added along the way by the sun in summer it will not be nearly as cold as it is in the winter when it arrives.  Now for the opposite.  The temperature in the tropics is almost constant.  So no matter what time of year it is the same temperature air will be coming up.  So in winter, that tropical air is the same temperature as it is in summer and we notice a spring like warmup in the Midwest.\n2.  The jet stream position is such that it is just south of the Midwest in winter but still close enough that a small shift can bring up warm air.  In the summer the jet stream is much farther North meaning a large shift, much larger than in winter would need to occur to pull artic air down to the Midwest.  Add to this that it is weaker in the summer and stronger in the winter and you are more likely to get large temperature swings in winter than you are in the summer.",

The sun, even on a cloudy day, is constantly adding heat to every lighted surface.\n\nThere are no mechanisms other than convection (heating gas) conduction (heating solids or liquids) or radiation (pure energy via infrared) to move heat.

During the winter time this jet moves south and becomes move wavey and when it becomes wavey it brings with it frontal systems. In the frot of these waved is warm air and behind are cold air. In the summer time weather changed tend to be gradual.",

The sun makes its appearance felt when conditions make it possible during the winter months. On the other hand in the summer when the sun is  in its closest position for higher heat.  It ( the heat source) does not disappear or move further from the earth. And when it\u2019s real cloudy or a storm arises it is not enough of a shield to stop the heat sources impact on the environment. ",

They are universal blood donors, and with few exceptions, blood from any greyhound can be given to any other breed of dog. They are also lean with big neck veins, thin skin, and very insensitive to pain. This combination is simply perfect for blood donation.",

When they said \"sleep for days\" they meant sleep forever. Certain barbituates can kill them. Instead of just inducing with propofol and keeping under with sevo, they require additional meds like acepromazole and atropine. My doc would pop em with ace and telazole, atropine,then keep them under with sevoflourane gas... you get the picture. Extra work and meds indeed, a few breeds required this protocol",

Many diseases are underlying, I.e they show no clinical signs. Pre-op blood work helps to identify contusions which would make anaesthesia life threatening. In young, apparently healthy dogs and cats, there are congenital conditions such as a hole in the heart, kidney dysplasia, liver shunts etc that wouldn't show up until the body is put under stress, such as anaesthesia.\n\nFor instance an apparently healthy dog might have a vein left over from when it was in the womb that bypasses the liver (a shunt), reducing oxygen supply to the organ. When anaesthetic drugs are given this puts an extra strain in the liver to break down the chemicals and it fails to compensate. This means the drugs stay in the system much longer than they should, or build to life-threatening levels. A simple test pre-anaesthesia will show the liver under strain, and more investigations can be performed to determine whether the dog is safe to undergo the procedure.",

It is usually they older heavy sedatives (i.e. acepromazine in fact! And domitor, and yes barbiturates) that they are more sensitive to and are more risky. The typical protocols recommended by most anesthesiologists, such as an opiate + benzodiazepine + propofol induction and maintenance on sevoflurane, is most ideal. It's the heavy sedation with minimal monitoring and attention to ventilation that is an issue for them.",

Can anyone comment?  \n\nI did have a scare when we gave one a single dose of acepromazine to our borzoi/greyhound mix after he lost his leg (1950's human antipsychotic no longer used much for that, \"now almost exclusively used on animals as a sedative and antiemetic\" [wp]).  He was totally unresponsive for 20+ hours, scared the hell out of me but the vet insisted he was ok, just lower the dose. 1/8 of a standard weight based dose was enough. Heard it was occasionally an issue with sighthounds.\n\nAnd I would call them stoic, not less sensitive to pain. \n",

If they use sevoflurane should be appropriate and maybe a little more expensive if they were using other kinds previously - I think they use it in human pediatrics too. Greyhounds do tend to be sensitive to anesthetics and wake up rough. Sevo is more expensive than some other gas anesthesia, but it's not exactly bred dependent. ",

Thiopental is broken down in the fat so any lean dogs will stay asleep much longer than weightier breeds. \n\nHowever this is an old drug in terms of anaesthesia and is now (at least in the Uk) only used by charity clinics who can't afford better, or by those wishing to save money. Much more reliable medications - such as propofol and isoflourane/sevoflourane - have taken its place, which are broken down a lot faster by the body and therefore allow for faster recovery. My guess is your vet used this instead in your dog's case, so in fact he was getting a higher standard of anaesthetic than other breeds at that clinic!\n\nA vet I once worked for tried to save money on a charity greyhound by using Thio instead of our usual drugs, but it ended up costing more as we had to kennel it for 2 days until it woke up!\n\n",

I currently run my hospital's in house blood donor program. \n\nYou should look for a veterinary blood bank to have your pupper donate blood. Lots of hospitals order their blood products from a blood bank and they have standards in place to not bleed your pupper dry. Also, very few general practices are equipped to do blood transfusions ( it takes about 4 hours, the cost is too high to constantly have blood products on hand, you need to do blood \"checks\" and observe closely for several hours after, etc) let alone be equipped to have a dog donate blood. \n\nMy hospital uses blood products from a blood bank, generally. But there are times when we get a large breed that needs several units of blood, we have expired products, or there is a back order on blood (because shortage) and in those times, when we have a patient that needs blood ASAP but no blood. That's when I call in my employees that have dogs that have been screened and vetted to bring in their dog to save a life. \n\nThe good news is that while greyhounds have universal blood, it never hurts to have your pupper to get screened to be a donor. Each donor needs to be of a good temperment (not aggressive, easy going), healthy body weight (at least 20#, without being overweight in dogs), up to date on vaccines, screened for blood parasites and disorders, be *at least* DEA 1.1 negative, between 1-7 years of age, and has not donated in the past 3 months. \n\nSo, short answer, yes. Long answer, yes but not just any hospital. ",

If it's your first needle, try to get one that was fostered, namely if you have stairs (more than 3 steps) that they need to go in and out of the home. We had 5 steps and it wasn't too bad. and there was bit of a learning curve for a non fostered dog.  She later learned a full flight, but wouldn't go up if you can see through the stairs. They all have different personalities and we saw between 4-6 before picking Allie (Emerald Spyder).",

They just have to be the same blood type and in general there aren't types specific to breeds (though the Dal antigen is present in most breeds at a high frequency but not commonly in Dalmations). The canine blood types that are commonly discussed are DEA 1.1, 1.2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and Dal. A canine universal donor would be negative for all DEAs except DEA 4 and about 60% of Greyhounds meet that criteria (compared to 28% of non-Greyhounds in one study). \n\nTLDR: You still have to blood type Greyhounds but they make great blood donors because many are universal donors and they have a higher percentage of red blood cells naturally.",

                            "comment": "We rank the importance of blood types by a few criteria:\n\n- the likelihood of a transfusion reaction (recipient rejecting donor blood)\n\n- the likelihood of the donor and recipient having different antigens in any given blood group system\n\n- the likelihood of the recipient receiving many transfusions from different donors\n\nFor most transfusions, ABO and RhD are the most important types to consider because they're highly variable in the population and highly likely to produce a reaction. The next strata of blood types (such as RhCE, Kell, Duffy, Kidd, MNS) are capable of producing a serious transfusion reaction but are less variable in the population. This means the donor is less likely to be mismatched against the recipient and the recipient isn't likely to have a serious reaction *if they've never been transfused before.* \n\nOnce someone has received multiple transfusions, however, their immune system will start to recognize the so-called \"minor\" blood groups as foreign, so blood bankers will start to test donor units for more antigens before they transfuse them to the patient. \n\nThe least-tested blood group antigens are the ones that are either very rarely variable in the population or don't produce an especially serious reaction, or both. \n\nFor example, in my lab we're helping genotype a patient with [McLeod syndrome](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/mcleod-neuroacanthocytosis-syndrome), a genetic disorder that eliminates (or seriously alters) a blood group antigen (Kx) that is highly conserved in the population. This means that a patient with a total absence of Kx can only receive blood transfusions from McLeod donors. Kx is considered a rare or minor antigen, not because it's unimportant in the event of a mismatch, but because it is so unlikely to be different between any two people. ",

If they now receive type B blood it is those antibodies in their blood stream that will cause the immune reaction that leads to problems. This is especially severe in the case of the ABO groups because their antibodies are IgM antibodies one of the major group of antibodies produced by the body, and their \"sticking\" to the blood cells is what causes the agglutination.\n\nWhat follows is that for the sake of blood transfusion you only have to pay attention to those blood types that have a corresponding antibody in the recipient's bloodstream, that might cause a reaction when transferred, and which levels are high enough to cause a reaction.\n\nThis is why you don't have to match all known types of antigens found on the membrane.\n\nOn the upper limit question. I'm not sure, logically at some point, the membrane must simply run out of space to host another strain of sugars or proteins on its membrane that can function as an antigen, but I haven't read anything on a practical limitation on this.",

Most of them haven't been studied as heavily, because they seen too have less of an effect on a transfusion patient than the DEA types.\n\nThe vast majority of dogs seem to be positive for DEA 4, so it's largely ignored. The most significant one is DEA 1, which more than half of dogs are positive for. The reason it's more significant, is because if you give blood that is DEA 1 positive to a patient with DEA 1 negative blood naturally, that patient could have a pretty severe reaction.  The other, more widely studied antigens are DEA 7 and DEA 5.  These four are the main ones that are tested for in potential donors. A \" universal\" donor is a dog who is negative for DEA 1, 5, and 7 at least.",

Also many New-World monkeys have prehensile tails - a trait that does not exist in Old-World Monkeys - and most of them are colorblind, unlike Old-World Monkeys which have trichromatic vision. \n\n\n*Yes, apes are monkeys regardless of what your English teacher is trying to tell you.",

A quick Google search is telling me its pH is from 4.5 - 5.5. So no, pH isn't a good indicator here.\n\nBut I did find an [article in The American Journal of Emergency Medicine](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735675700900627?via%3Dihub) that describes a case where a coconut was used as an emergency source of IV fluid. Here's the conclusion for those behind a paywall:\n\n&gt;In conclusion, we report a case in which coconut water\nwas administered intravenously in a Solomon Island patient\nwithout adverse effects. Coconut fluid has been shown to be\nan effective form of intravenous hydration solution in small\nvolumes over short periods of time, and can be considered a\ntemporizing alternative to standard intravenous fluids in\nremote areas where supplies are scarce and coconuts,\nabundant and inexpensive. Additionally, it is a good source\nof potassium, chloride, and calcium and its use could be\nfurther indicated in situations in which these specific electrolytes\nneed to be urgently increased. However, further studies\nneed to be conducted to substantiate the emergency use.",

Even then, that was mostly luck. In the early 1900s scientists discovered the ABO blood group by mixing red blood cells and serum from different people and seeing agglutination. This discovery is generally credited to Karl Landsteiner, but others hit on the same discovery around the same time. \n\nThe discovery of ABO and serocompatibility opened the door to safe transfusions and the invention of anticoagulant storage solutions led to blood banking. \n\nIf the scientific community had ever thought transfusions were outright impossible we wouldn't have ever figured out how to make them safe, because we would have stopped trying.

The quickest and dirtiest way would be to replicate the early experiments that Landsteiner et al did back in the early 1900s: prick your finger, squeeze out a drop of blood onto a non-porous surface, like a piece of glass. Prick someone else's finger, squeeze out a drop of blood next to the first drop, then mix them together. If the blood starts to clump up (agglutinate), there's a blood group incompatibility, likely in ABO. \n\nIf you have access to a safe method of venipuncture and a centrifuge, you can draw blood into an anticoagulant, spin the sample down to separate the red blood cells from the plasma, then combine red cells from person A with plasma from person B and vice versa and look for agglutination.\n\n[Here's a graphic I made for a talk](http://imgur.com/a/WUwA3) illustrating the outcomes of different ABO cells and plasma combinations. \n\nBriefly: People will make the antibody to the ABO antigen they don't have. People who are type A make anti-B antibodies. People who are type B make anti-A antibodies. People who are type O make both anti-A and anti-B. People who are AB make neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies. If you mix the plasma from a person who is type O with the cells of a person who is A or B, they will clump. If you mix cells from the O person with plasma from an A or a B, they *won't* clump, because the O cell has neither A nor B antigens. ",

            "comment": "The short answer is yes, as you can see. \nI want to address the broader question here that many commenters are sort of missing. How is blood in itself different between species. \nMost of the issues when you think about \"typing\" is a consequence of learning about the antibodies present on red blood cells. About every cell in your body has two little towers, MHC complexes. These function to let your immune system function, part of their job though involves with the cell nucleus, which rbc do not have. Blood does NOT have these complexes either! Instead there are a variety of very complex \"factors\" and other functional proteins, carbohydrates and such. This is really important because it is those factors that lead to coagulation upon transmission into a new individual. They clump to other blood cells and clog our veins/arteries interestingly enough for dogs and cats (maybe others I am not sure), most can get a transfusion the first time and be fine. Now this is certainly not best practice but it goes to show the difference in the coagulation cascade between mammals.  \nOther animals have an incredible amount of diversity for example:\n\n1. Bovines have 80 blood factors and 11 groups\n2. Porcines have 16 groups\n3. Sheep have 22 factors and 7 groups\n4. Equines have 34 factors and 7 groups\n\nIn humans you really would not have a scenario were say an individual mates with another one and their baby dies, but in some animals this can happen and it is called neonatal isoerythrolysis and probably a result of domestication and inbreeding. It is more complicated than simple \"typing\" and has alot to do with the antigens present such as Mik antigen in cats, and unfortunately the prevalence for this is unknown. This is why vets should ALWAYS CROSSMATCH, because typing alone does not really tell the whole story. Unfortunately, most clinicians have limited experience or technical capabilities to do this and opt to type or Ive seen many times no typing be done and infusions given if that is the animals first one.   \n\nFurther than that it is important to remember we are talking about mammals. Avian and reptile species have nucleated blood cells which is another whole game. Mammals decided a long time ago to shoot out our nucleus and have increased oxygen carrying as a benefit. bird and reptile haematology is incredibly complicated and honestly I am not sure I have really heard of transfusions being common. Ejection of the nucleus is the rate limiting step for pre rbcs to become erythrocytes (rbcs) and this is not needed in reptiles and birds. So to an extent they have a faster maturation time for blood. Therefore, it has been less common to try transfusions and little research has been done.  We really do not know a lot about other (exotic) species in general and hematology is a complex field to study. Most of the work is going to happen in a zoo, university, or the field. Whereas the common pet/livestock species are more likely candidates  for this research. For every 100 research project at a school I'd say maybe 10 are exotic focused, but this depends upon the school. \n\n\n\nEdit: I shouldn't talk about humans I suppose, it is possible for humans to have a similar condition with their offspring but different mechanisms are involved.

For a rare blood type, it would certainly expire before being used. Pretty much everyone at a vet clinic has pets, so it's just a matter of knowing which pets have what blood type and asking that staff member if the pet is able to donate. I was also told by a vet at the emergency clinic that dogs won't react to the wrong blood type on a first transfusion. That still makes no biologic sense to me though, it's not like an allergy.",

This is very important information for breeders as blood type B cats produce anti A antibodies in colostrum. This means that a blood type B queen (female) bred to a blood type A stud can result in roughly a 50 / 50 split in A and B blood types in the litter. If allowed to suckle in the first 18 to 25 hours of birth the blood type A kittens can lose toes, tips of the tail and eventually die. While some breeds such as the oriental are almost always A, other breeds like the British Shorthair have a very high number of B blood type cats. So testing all breeding cats for blood type is essential. Occasionally breeders may decide the mating of an A stud to B girl is worthwhile, however the breeder must hand rear the kittens for the first 24 hours to prevent ingestion of the high antibody colostrum. A type A queen can nurse both A and B kittens. Blood type AB is separate from the other groups entirely and can nurse either however it is the rarest blood group. ",

ABO antigens are extremely common in the environment, so we're well-acquainted with them from early on. Most anti-ABO antibodies are IgM, however it's not uncommon for people to seroconvert and also make IgG antibodies to ABO. This is most common in people who are blood type O. \n\nIgM vs IgG isn't super-important when it comes to transfusion reactions, though. Blood banks care less about the serotype of an antibody and more about whether it exists at all. ",

            "comment": "Fun fact, when you say A+ or A-, we're (unknowingly) referring to the presence or absence of something called the ['Rhesus Factor' or 'Rh Factor'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rh_blood_group_system#Rh_factor) on our Red Blood Cells. \n\n&gt;An individual either has, or does not have, the \"Rh factor\" on the surface of their red blood cells. This term strictly refers only to the most immunogenic D antigen of the Rh blood group system, or the Rh\u2212 blood group system. The status is usually indicated by Rh positive (Rh+ does have the D antigen) or Rh negative (Rh\u2212 does not have the D antigen) suffix to the ABO blood type. However, other antigens of this blood group system are also clinically relevant. These antigens are listed separately (see below: Rh nomenclature). In contrast to the ABO blood group, immunization against Rh can generally only occur through blood transfusion or placental exposure during pregnancy in women.\n\nNow to the cool part, if you haven't guessed already, the Rh factor was first observed in the blood of the Rhesus Monkey!\n\n&gt;The rhesus blood type named after the rhesus monkey was first discovered in 1937 by Karl Landsteiner and Alexander S. Wiener. The significance of the discovery was not immediately apparent and was only realized in 1940, after subsequent findings by Philip Levine and Rufus Stetson.[1] This serum that led to the discovery was produced by immunizing rabbits with red blood cells from a rhesus macaque. The antigen that induced this immunization was designated by them as Rh factor to indicate that rhesus blood had been used for the production of the serum.[2]\n\n&gt;In 1939, Phillip Levine and Rufus Stetson published in a first case report the clinical consequences of non-recognized Rh factor, hemolytic transfusion reaction and hemolytic disease of the newborn in its most severe form.[3] It was recognized that the serum of the reported woman agglutinated with red blood cells of about 80% of the people although the then known blood groups, in particular ABO were matched. No name was given to this agglutinin when described. In 1940, Karl Landsteiner and Alexander S. Wiener made the connection to their earlier discovery, reporting a serum that also reacted with about 85% of different human red blood cells.[4]\n\n&gt;Based on the serologic similarities Rh factor was later also used for antigens, and anti-Rh for antibodies, found in humans such as the previously described by Levine and Stetson. Although differences between these two sera were shown already in 1942 and clearly demonstrated in 1963, the already widely used term \"Rh\" was kept for the clinically described human antibodies which are different from the ones related to the rhesus monkey. This real factor found in rhesus macaque was classified in the Landsteiner-Wiener antigen system (antigen LW, antibody anti-LW) in honor of the discoverers. [5][6] It was recognized that the Rh factor was just one in a system of various antigens. Based on different models of genetic inheritance, two different terminologies were developed; both of them are still in use.\n\nJust as others said, yes, primates do have the same blood types as us humans. A lot of research hinges on this, I believe. Just ask Mr. Rhesus over there!",

Humans *are* animals, so already we know that some animals have blood types because we are an example of that. And like with blood types, the closer related we are to other animals the more similar our traits will be (on average). The exception to this is traits that aren't directly a result of DNA. So a question like \"Do other animals walk on two feet\" is more difficult to answer because that isn't directly determined by DNA, rather it is a result of our unique bone structure (which *is* determined by DNA and is similar to other animals).",

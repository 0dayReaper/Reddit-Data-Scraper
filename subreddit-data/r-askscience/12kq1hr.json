When you're focused on maximum depth of field, you're focusing on the farthest object possible for that lens/sensor combo.

A wide aperture/shutter (low f-stop) causes shallow depth of field, so you only have foreground OR background in focus at once.  Wider DOF (higher f-stop, narrower shutter iris) can make both foreground and background in focus.\n\nThe thing is, usually when you are focused \"at infinity\", you are unnecessarily missing out on some focus potential on nearer objects because your depth of field is a range and when you focus to infinity you are wasting about half that range on objects \"further than infinity\".   Being at hyperfocal, you are maximizing your DOF by putting infinity at the far edge of your DOF range rather than the middle.\n\nedit:  putting it more simply, you are at hyperfocal when **effective** DOF matches the **potential maximum** DOF that the optical system could allow.",

They cannot be perfectly sharp, but the sharpness is limited by other aspects of the optical system, not by focus. What /u/Cute_Consideration38 is getting at is that it's not the case that this range extends, say, from the actual focal distance to, say, twice that distance: instead, if the system is focused beyond a certain distance away, called the **hyperfocal distance**, then *everything* beyond that distance will be in focus. (And some distance nearer than that, too). \"Infinity\" comes into play that because, if you consider some feature that is theoretically infinite distance away, then light rays coming from a point on that feature are all parallel. This puts a lower bound on the amount of focusing power required to resolve a feature (things further away require *less* focusing power - that is less *change to the angles of light rays*). In contrast there is no analogous upper bound for things very close. (However there are other practical lower bounds: if the front of your lens is in focus, it is not useful to focus any closer, for example)",

First some definitions:  The total light power emitted by an object is called *intensity*, while that total power divided by the area over which the light is observed is *luminance*. \n\nAn example: You observe (or take a photo) of a light bulb at 1 meter and you sense a level of 'brightness'. This is the energy of the light bulb over the area of your sensor (eye or camera) during the period you observed. If you do the same at 2 meters, the inverse square law says the energy you gather through your sensor drops off as 2^2 or 1/4 the amount of energy. At the same time the image has gotten half the size on your sensor, which means its area has gone down 2^2, or it is 1/4 the size, therefore it is the *same energy per unit area* on the sensor. This means the apparent brightness of something is independent of distance, since the received power goes down at the same rate as the image size. \n\nThe more light you let in, and the longer you wait, the more energy you accumulate to make the image - that's one reason telescopes have large diameters and exposure times are long.\n\nThus, a galaxy farther away will have the same apparent brightness as if you were closer, but it will be smaller. Size is dependent on distance, but luminosity is not.",

This means that the universe was quite a bit smaller back when light was originally emitted from ancient galaxies.  This expansion not only causes the redshift that we often hear about, but also causes these distant galaxies to appear wider than they would if we lived in a universe that wasn't expanding. \n\nWe are accustomed to the apparent size of an object decreasing as the distance increases.  But this is only true if the space between you and the distant object is relatively static.  In a rapidly expanding universe, a distant galaxy will take up more of our visual field than you would otherwise expect, since the smaller universe of the past is being visually mapped onto the edge of our now much-larger universe.\n\nThis is why when looking at the deep field image, extremely distant galaxies are the same apparent size as much closer ones -- the expansion of the universe is actually magnifying the image of these ancient galaxies for us!",

If you took a galaxy and moved it farther and farther way from us, but keeping it otherwise exactly the same, it would look smaller and smaller for a while. Eventually, however, it no longer gets any smaller; the size it appears in the sky stays relatively constant.

And that distortion only gets less if a galaxy is tilted with respect to our viewing angle, and most are. Also, if we're talking about seeing the shape and structure, we're talking about galaxies tilted to the point where the whole disc is roughly equidistant from our viewing angle and the light from all of it is very close (relatively speaking) to being all the same age.",

            "comment": "Our immune mechanisms are unbelievably efficacious when it comes to killing cancerous cells. We are very, very good at fighting cancer. What kills us is simple statistics.\n\nThe average human body has about 37 trillion cells. It takes about 80 days for your body to kill and regrow an amount of cells equal to this number. That means that each day a human body kills and replenishes about 400 billion cells. \n\nEven if one in a hundred million of these was a mutant capable of turning to cancer (which is a number I just plucked from thin air for purpose.of visualization, rather than for scientific accuracy), that would mean your body kills 4000 potential cancer progenitors a day. That would be almost 1.5 million a year.\n\nThe sheer scale of what the immune system is capable of is immense. And for that reason, even with an almost perfect system, an error is bound to happen at some point.\n\nThe issue we have at our hands once one slips through though is a vicious one: your immune cells are trained to not overly attack your own cells to prevent autoimmunity. The issue is, that cancer cells are still your cells. And once a cancer cell acquires enough mutations to hide, stay alive, disregard death signals and multiply without regard for tissue integrity, you have an issue. Your body is doing what it can but cancer evades the processes your body has for control of damage and intrusion-control\n\nEdit: according to NIH [link](https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/age) the average age of a cancer diagnosis is 66. If I make it an even 60 to compensate for smaller cell counts in early development, your body will have gone through a grand total of about 11.680.000.000.000.000 cells until one eventually will have become aberrant and developed cancer. This error rate is unfathomably low and visualizes a shred of the immense capability of an organism to defend itself against potentially threatening cells and it's ability to regenerate.",

                    "comment": "Moreover, if the errors pop up at age 58 or later, the selective pressure against them is low.  Yes, humans are designed to need some old people as a store of experience and expertise.  But they have already reproduced, passing on their genes.  Cancer rates in people of reproductive age are quite low. \n\nOur bodies are evolved to fight against infectious diseases as well--typhoid, small pox, influenza, measles, etc.  People, including young adults, still died from them in much higher numbers than from cancer. Evolution isn't perfect.   You don't notice how badly we are adapted to fighting infectious disease because our technology is better at fighting infectious disease, at least for now.",

As long as a high enough percentage of individuals don't die of cancer _before they can reproduce,_ evolution \"does not care\" what happens after.\n\nAnd nowadays we have way longer life expectancies than most of human history, so the evolutive pressure to overcome cancer at 60 or older was not very high.\n\nAnimals that have very high rates of cancer simply reproduce younger so they have time to do it before dying of cancer.",

An individual could produce offspring then die, and that death could lead to the death of the offspring, in which case their reproduction was ultimately not a success. Or they could survive, and their children could survive, but all of their grandchildren could die from lack of support, in which case they didn't successfully reproduce.\n\nThere is no bar for successful reproduction. No finish line. An individual's reproductive success only exists so long as their progeny exists. That can change at any time.",

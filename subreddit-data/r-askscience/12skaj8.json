Because the study is double blind, all phenomena are recorded, and it would only be after unblinding that you could actually do the statistical correlation to determine whether this is a side-effect (that is, attributable to the use of the subject under study vs. a placebo) or just noise in the data.",

I\u2019d they\u2019re expecting to become nauseous from it, they might become nauseous despite the placebo drug not having that effect. Also, side effects are somewhat unique to the person, and some people might not experience side effects that others do.",

The point was made that the placebo effect was very high, and the point was made that the only reason the actual drug was incrementally better than the already effective placebo was because the actual drug had side effects, so the placebo effect was even stronger because the patients knew they were taking a drug.",

The placebo effect can be very strong : people tried to commit suicide using placebos and ended up at the hospital in critical condition until he got the info, that it was merely a placebo.\nPlacebos can cure IBS and solve problems with knees (basically a fake surgery).",

For instance, say that nausea was reported for 40% of patients who received an active drug and in 25% of patients who received placebo. During the trial, it's not clear what the increased risk of nausea is, but in the analysis we learn that there's an \"increased risk\" of nausea.",

            "comment": "The whole purpose of a double blind, placebo-controlled study is to determine if such affects ARE the result of the medication or not.  As the researcher observing the patient you don't know whether your patient is getting the real drug or not, so you can't know if the side effect is caused by the medication or not.  Its only once all the data is gathered and you reveal who was on the placebo that you can determine if there is enough evidence to say the drug was responsible.  \n\nKeep in mind most side effects are something that can be caused by multiple sources.  So you have a patient who starts experiencing acute nausea.  Maybe its the drug.  Maybe its a food intolerance or allergy they recently developed and weren't aware of.  Maybe they became pregnant (and if they are a man, you have a whole new side effect to worry about for your drug!).  Maybe they had food poisoning recently.  Maybe its psychosomatic.  Its sometimes hard to narrow down all the possible sources for a side effect thats why you need to test enough people AND do a double blind study with a placebo (if at all possible) so you can gather enough evidence to make those conclusions.",

You expect to see changes following introduction of the treatment(A),a reversal of these effects after the treatment is stopped (B), and a resumption of the changes after the treatment (A) is applied again.",

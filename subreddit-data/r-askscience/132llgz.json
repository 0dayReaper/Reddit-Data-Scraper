    "postText": "Seeing as driving tired can easily get to the point where it's as dangerous as driving drunk, is there any way to test for it, like there is with alcohol? Or would you have to rely on other tests, like reaction or co-ordination, to determine safety to drive?\n\nI've never heard of it, and I can't think of how it could possibly be done, but I might be missing something.\n\nThanks.",

Bonus points for using sterile technique.  Stents or PICC implant-type for CSF sampling.\n\nOr -- if you are looking for something a little less invasive, fMRI with the software upgrade in a simulator may do the trick.",

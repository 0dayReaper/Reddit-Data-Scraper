    "postText": "My knowledge of cancer is minimal so apologies in advance but from my basic understanding, cell division is constantly happening and when uncontrolled\ngrowth happens it causes cancer. I also understand whenever you touch or do anything you are shedding loads of cells. If your body is replacing these cells, are ultra marathon runners or people who put their body under enormous stress for long periods where their body has to replace larger amounts of cells more susceptible then to cancer? Or is my understanding of cell division wrong?",

            "comment": "I'm not sure that elite endurance athletes have a substantially higher rate of cell turnover than others. They do put themselves under greater stress which increases some cellular turnover (like red blood cells) but I would imagine that infections, autoimmune diseases (like lupus), or other stressors like regular alcohol usage would also induce higher cellular turnover. I couldn't find a good way to compare these and I'm not even sure that the studies exist. If they do, I'd love for someone to post more information about it!\n\nWhat we do know is that more physical exercise results in less cancer. This has been shown in quite a few studies and is well accepted. Generally aerobic exercise is considered the best for cancer reduction though resistance training (IE weight lifting) also provides a benefit. \n\nThere is some concern for elite athletes having a higher risk for cancer. Not because of increased cell turnover, but rather increased reactive oxygen species from increased oxygen consumption. There have been quite a few studies looking at elite triathletes and DNA damage and they found no lasting DNA damage, potentially due to increased antioxidant production.\n\nPhysical activity reduces cancer risk (reivew) - [https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc2325](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrc2325)\n\nTriathletes and DNA damage (1) - [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300483X09004685?via%3Dihub](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300483X09004685?via%3Dihub)\n\nTriathletes and DNA damage (2) - [https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/17/8/1913/162489/No-Acute-and-Persistent-DNA-Damage-after-an](https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/17/8/1913/162489/No-Acute-and-Persistent-DNA-Damage-after-an)\n\nEndurance athletes and DNA damage (review) - [https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06106.x](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06106.x)\n\nBlood antioxidants levels in triathletes - [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/antioxidant-responses-to-an-acute-ultraendurance-exercise-impact-on-dna-stability-and-indications-for-an-increased-need-for-nutritive-antioxidants-in-the-early-recovery-phase/248BD3D5621005821C048692D207C160](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-journal-of-nutrition/article/antioxidant-responses-to-an-acute-ultraendurance-exercise-impact-on-dna-stability-and-indications-for-an-increased-need-for-nutritive-antioxidants-in-the-early-recovery-phase/248BD3D5621005821C048692D207C160)",

I had the understanding that overall more exercise is mostly beneficial but this particular question hit my brain and I didn\u2019t know how to even search for the correct answer. Interesting that increased oxygen causes concern for cancer growth. I\u2019ll do some more reading!",

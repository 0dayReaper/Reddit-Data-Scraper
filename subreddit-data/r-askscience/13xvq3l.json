However, regular orgasms might slightly contribute to better cardiac health alongside more specific measures like regular exercise.",

And during regular cardio your heart rate rises more.\n\nYou can get up, do 10 jumping jacks, sit down and call it a day. That's about the same benefit. No way comparable to an even 5 minute cardio.",

Can you clarify something then?\n\nSo I've read somewhere that exercise reduces stress, in part, because it induces stress on the body, and therefore, the body becomes more adept at dealing with all kinds of stress, because it can't differentiate between exercise-induced stress and other stress, such as stress induces from work.\n\nSo, is this inaccurate, and if so, which parts?",

The \"stress\" that exercise induces is not equivalent to release of \"stress hormones\" by being \"stressed\". The word \"stress\" is different in these different contexts, so I would just recommend not getting too caught up on the semantics. \n\nIt sounds like what you heard was more of a simplified description that was provided at the expense of specific accuracy\n\nThis is a reason why scientists can be very particular about language used (and why news about science can misrepresent it sometimes)",

    "postText": "Examples such as the recent Ukrainian dam breach or other areas where dams are being methodicaly removed are leaving behind large areas that have been submerged for decades. How is this land transformed by the muck I expect has accumulated and what happens (aside from it drying out) over time? Is it more fertile? Sterile due to buildup?",

            "comment": "There's been a fair bit of research on this topic in the last decade or so as dam removal, especially in the US, has been en vogue during this time period. What we've observed in these scenarios suggest that the river system typically removes (via erosion) most of the impounded sediment relatively quickly, i.e., in a few months to years (e.g., [Foley et al., 2017](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017WR020457), [Tsutsumi &amp; Laronne, 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118971437.ch13)). As discussed in these reviews, the response speed depends on a few factors though, like the size (in the sense of discharge) of the river, the \"head\" of the dam (i.e., what's the height difference between the top of the reservoir and the height of the water downstream of the dam), the sediment caliber (i.e., grain size), and the rapidity of dam removal itself. If dams are removed more gradually, the response tends to be more gradual (e.g., [Burroughs et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169555X09001275)) and similarly, if dams are removed on relatively small or low flow rivers and/or a dam with low head, the response is slow (e.g., [Cheng &amp; Granata, 2007](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2005WR004271)). The removal of the Ukranian dam happened on a relatively large river, on a relatively large dam, and happened quickly, so barring significant barriers to rapid response from the type of sediment in the river or other factors, if the process was allowed to complete, we'd generally expect for the upstream sediment deposited behind the reservoir to be evacuated in the coming months to years and the landscape upstream to return to something broadly similar to the pre-dam state.\n\nOne relevant bit about dam removal (planned or unplanned), is that beyond the obvious flood risks downstream that come from the unplanned variety, there have long been concerns about the distribution of the formerly impounded sediments downstream. This is because very often these end up having a relatively high concentration of various contaminants, reflecting sequestration and concentration over time behind the dam of varieties of compounds and elements that are transported in low concentration within the sediment load or water column, but accumulated over time behind the dam. For example, this paper from [Evans &amp; Gottgens, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0380133007701363) considers the \"contaminant stratigraphy\" of the deposit behind a particular dam that was being considered for removal. In detail, many studies of contaminants after dam removal don't find huge fluxes of these contaminants following removal (e.g., [Ashley et al., 2006](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-006-4781-3), [Cantwell et al., 2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-014-3742-5)), but a lot depends on the nature of dam removal and the exact contaminant load within the sequestered sediments.",

There are many factors that will determine how far up in the atmosphere ash particles will travel, but the primary thing to remember here is that these particles are solids, not gases. They are light enough to temporarily get kicked around and suspended in the gases that make up our atmosphere and will eventually fall to the ground. \n\nDepending on how close you are to the fires however, even a high mountain might not be safe. \n\nI'm in Kentucky and have roughly 1000ft elevation difference between my home and relative's home where the higher up home has less visible particulate in the air when the ground difference between the 2 is roughly 30 miles. We are very far away from the fires so if you are closer, it could be a different story.",

And \"less of it\" simply means lower pressure. In other words, the *partial pressure* of oxygen is lower because the total air pressure is lower. \n\nDown below sea level, the inverse occurs. The deeper you go, the higher the pressure, because there is more atmosphere above pressing down on you. So the partial pressure of oxygen would be higher, as would the partial pressure of every other gas in the air. And that higher partial pressure will have effects on anyone who breathes it. \n\nWhat we now call [decompression sickness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_sickness), or \"the bends,\" was discovered in the late 19th century, long before SCUBA diving was invented.  During the construction of the hollow, watertight footings of the Brooklyn Bridge (called caissons), workers would sometimes get inexplicably ill when coming up from the bottoms of the structures too rapidly. Hence, the bends were originally called \"caisson disease.\"",

But at lower pressures, the gasses can\u2019t be exchanged in lung tissue. Your lungs need a certain amount of atmospheric pressure to be able to pass o2 into and co2 out of their tissues.\n\nYou can breathe 100% oxygen via a mask at very high altitude, but you\u2019ll still pass out and eventually die if the oxygen in the mask isn\u2019t being pumped in under enough pressure for efficient gas exchange to happen in the lungs-  so yeah, those little cups that fall from the ceiling of an airplane, don\u2019t form a perfect seal on your face, and that don\u2019t push O2 under pressure into your lungs aren\u2019t going to do much for you above a certain cabin altitude; they\u2019re just there to give you a fighting chance while the crew does an emergency decent to a lower altitude where there\u2019s enough pressure to allow your lungs to work properly.",

The partial pressure of oxygen is 21% of the total pressure.  The partial pressure of any gas in a mixture is the percentage of total gas that the gas in question comprises, times the total pressure.  So, to answer your question, the oxygen content at a lower-than-sea-level elevation would be the same, 21%.  The total pressure and therefore the O2 partial pressure would be higher.",

            "comment": "Your lungs do two important things when you are breathing. Getting oxygen into your blood is one that everyone knows about, and it's certainly important. Equally as important is getting carbon dioxide out of your blood. If you're under a blanket or something and start to get the uncomfortable feeling that you aren't getting enough air, it's usually due to difficulty getting rid of carbon dioxide, not difficulty getting oxygen.\n\nThe air at the bottom of your crater is about 50% denser and thus has more oxygen, but it also has more carbon dioxide. Assuming this is on today's Earth, with about 420 ppm CO2, the air outside is going to be equivalent to 630 ppm. This is comparable to what people experience in a reasonably well ventilated room, and shouldn't cause any trouble. People usually start having mild symptoms of CO2 toxicity around 1000 ppm, with fatigue and poor cognitive function kicking in around 2000 ppm.\n\nBut not everyone in your crater will necessarily be outside. If you build a structure in the crater, ventilation will be even more important than it is at sea level. Because the baseline CO2 is much higher, it will be the case that there's much less room for poor ventilation before people start to suffer.",

Just like water pressure, its about the amount of stuff above you that give you pressure. That said, orographic lifting requires an action moment like wind to occur, so the \"bowl\" of air would likely be ore homogenous and likely different that air outside the mountain bowl. It would likely be more humid and slghtly cooler.",

The bigger the difference in pressure then the more oxygen absorbed until a certain point. So people at high altitude have a lower difference in pressure between the atmospheric pressure and the alveoli pressure in their lungs and absorb less of the 21% oxygen into the blood.\nThere may be limits to the altitude before the 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen mix changes. However at the top of Mt Everest its still the 78/21 mix.",

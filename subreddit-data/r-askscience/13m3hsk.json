Humans averaged 47.*\r \n\n*One of the researchers, Dr Alex Cagan, said the pattern was \"striking\" and it was \"really surprising and exciting\" that all the animals in the study converged on \"about 3,200\" mutations across their lifetime.*\r  \n*If people's DNA mutated at the same rate as that of mice, we would die with more than 50,000 genetic alterations.*\r  \n*\"Despite having different lifespans, at the end of life the mammals had the same number of mutations,\" Dr Cagan told the BBC.*  \n*\"This is the number, but what does it mean?

Additionally, the vast majority of the human genome doesn't code for proteins, and some mutations simply cause a cell to die. Additionally, the amount of energy used in regulating mutations is miniscule compared to nerve signaling and muscle actions, so it wont be as important. In short, there are reasons that longer living animals have less frequent mutations, and there are a vast number of variables affecting it.",

They have their own generic code and they accumulate mutations, as well.\n\n**Epigenetics.** Epigenetics are tags your cells put on your DNA to remind itself what kind of cell it is. Eventually the cell has too many tags and confuses itself.\n\n**Junk Proteins.** Cells occasionally misfold proteins and they keep them around to recycle later when it needs the resources. Cells may also stick glucoses onto proteins to store energy like tucking a $20 under a sofa cushion. Sticking glucoses onto proteins may make them stop working. To clear this junk out you need to trigger a cellular process called autophagy, which is a fancy word for fasting. You fast (or take a drug or supplement which triggers autophagy) to make your cells clean their recycle bins.",

Cancer/tumors are essentially uncontrolled and runaway cell division, so by shutting down old cells you likely reduce cancer prevalence. \n\nIf we \"solved\" aging, I think we would end up just dying from cancer more.

Telomeres are a tradeoff, making them longer costs some resources and (probably much more importantly) increases your cancer risk.  When a cell turns cancerous, it only has so many divisions before its telomeres run out.  If it mutates in a way that re-enables telomerase before then, it can keep going.  So the shorter your telomeres, the less runway all of your cancer cells have.  \n\nSort of like running your giant anime robots off batteries to limit the damage they do when they inevitably go berserk.",

Cancer frequency and survivability in 25 year olds is astronomically better than 85 year olds.\n\nFor cancer to become the most common form of death if we solved aging it would imply lifespans beyond 200 (if not much higher) excluding the 100+ years of cancer treatments developed in that time (plus the time between now and a cure for aging)",

First off older people are closer to death anyways so saying cancer got you at 85 could just be writing down the last reason you were at the hospital. Second, i believe in younger people cancer hits harder due to the body still growing. This increases the rate cancer spreads but i haven't fact checked that yet to be sure.",

If you have a look at the 2 hit hypothesis, basically for a somatic mutation adults will have to have 2 insults (mutations) that will then develop into cancer. Children born with a mutation have the first insult so to speak, and cancer develops at the second insult (mutation). \n\nI am far oversimplifying this because I'm lazy, so forgive me. There are multiple factors and yes because children are still growing their cells are actively dividing rapidly which can contribute to cancer development, but if it was the knly factor everyone would have cancer as a child. The genetic mutation in the Germline plus random mutation during development is the cancer risk.\n\nSorry for the waffle, I haven't even washed my face yet today.",

If the answer is yes, then yes mutations affect aging. If you mean the process of becoming elderly and infirm, there is a lot more to it than mutations. We acquire mutations throughout our lives, and this is the reason you see more cancer in the old than the young, more mutations mean mroe chances for that mutation to hit a gene involved in cancer. But there are other processes that are happening that don't appear mutation related that play a role in some theories.

When your cells divide, a little bit of the telomere gets snipped off.  Eventually, the telomere is gone, and your genes start getting snipped off.  \n\nStress plays a factor in aging.  Your body's fight-or-flight system basically kicks your body into overdrive, on the assumption that what's happening *right now* is bad enough to sacrifice some longevity in order to get away from it.  Afterwards, you can relax and your body recovers and resets from the stress.  Unfortunately, a lot of modern life is so stressful that your body never gets to destress and recover. Being poor/stressed literally shortens your life.  \n\nThe random genetic mutations?  There are a lot of diseases that are caused by those mutations, like (many of the hundreds of varieties of) cancer.",

Unfortunately, when telomeres run out, either cell division slows to a stop, or coding dna begins to be eroded from the fastest cycling, longest lineage genomes.  I doubt the erosion vulnerable genes are random. Darwin has sorted telomere proximity by their probability-ratio of curing vs causing cancer.  However, when enough genes become eroded from the genome, cancer probability becomes a similar to the probability of functional failure of the cell. Death either way at a certain age. \n\nThis evolutionary choice of telomere-limited mitotic cell division limits coincides with the strong selection for genome evolution via sexual crossing.   \n\nAsexual evolution involved neither linear dna and concomitant division limits, nor exon shuffling, which was a boon for eukaryotic evolution .",

There's another issue with simply lengthening telomeres indefinitely as well.\n\nThere's a particular type of cell that does not inhibit the production of telomerase, the enzyme responsible for lengthening telomeres. Cancerous cells. Most cells will only divide a certain number of times before death, but cancerous cells circumvent this via telomerase. By promoting telomerase production you unfortunately greatly increase the potency of cancer, last I read.\n\nIt's not hopeless though, and in the long run this factor can be dealt with through telomerase, there's just a thorny issue first, we need to be able to beat the resultant cancers. This has been done in mice using several tumour suppressive genes and results [in an increase in lifespan](https://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(08)01191-4). Given though that one of the major benefits of tackling ageing is a greatly reduced cancer risk, it would be ideal not to rely on having to beat cancer before we can tackle telomere length as a factor.

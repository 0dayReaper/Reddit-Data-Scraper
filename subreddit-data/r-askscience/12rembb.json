Since 1850 [we have released an estimated 2,500 Gt CO\u2082e in total, heavily weighted towards the present.](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-are-historically-responsible-for-climate-change/)\n\nSo we\u2019ve released 5-6% of the PETM CO\u2082e, in 0.3% of the time\u2026and we\u2019re currently pumping it into the air (and land and seas) about 60 times faster than the PETM annual average rate.",

But hopefully we will stop burning fossil fuels soon. I'm hoping we stop polluting before something bad happens. Unfortunately I don't think voters care that much unless they are affected directly by it.\n\nI've been wanting to move to New Mexico but I'm worried about rising temperatures and mega droughts\n\nAre you scared for the Earth's future?",

            "comment": "Yes. NPR yesterday Science Friday. Brain scan plus AI analysis could tell which image of a B/W video that mice were looking at. Meaning they did AI analysis of B/W vid. Then they plugged wires into mice and showed them the vid, and picked up brain signals which they gave to the AI. AI could tell which frame in the vid they were looking at.\n\nGoogle found it! Text in page says this, with link to show. 'reconstructing a short movie clip based on brain signals recorded in mice.' https://www.npr.org/podcasts/583350334/science-friday",

They used the first 9 times to train their algorithm and the 10th time as the test. It's really impressive that they were able to decode the movie nearly frame-by-frame but it is quite far from decoding someone's natural thoughts.\n\nThere was another study that came out recently that was able to get the gist of what people were listening to by decoding fMRI scans. This required \\~16 hours of training material for their algorithm and was individual specific.\n\nWe're getting closer to being able to match brain patterns to thoughts but we still have a lot to figure out before we can just take a scan of someone's brain and determine what they're thinking or feeling.\n\nShowing mice movies - [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06031-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06031-6)\n\nDecoding fMRI scans in humans - [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01304-9.epdf](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-023-01304-9.epdf)",

            "comment": "Not necessarily. As advances in functional brain imaging develop, it may become possible to narrow down the exact cortical area that gets activated when having a specific thought. But that will be different for every person and it would not be possible to \"decode\" what that thought was, for example. So you might have some specific pattern of activation when you're thinking about your home but it would not be possible for someone without any knowledge of your previous thoughts to determine that you were thinking about home just based on some functional imaging result.",

When the computer read his mind, it also picked up the memory that he came home drunk to his dorm that night.",

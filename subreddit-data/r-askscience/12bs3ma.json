    "postText": "Filariasis or Elephantiasis is a human disease caused by the nematode parasite Wuchereria bancrofti. The adult parasite gives birth to a microfilaria from the lymphatic system. The worm then goes into the human's circulatory system, gets sucked by a mosquito, develops until it is reintroduced to another human host and develop into adults in the lymphatic system. Thus its cycle. I have heard that the mosquito is a necessary step in the cycle, but I don't see why other than it being the transmission vector. Is there another reason the parasite has to go through the mosquito in order for it to develop? Do mosquitoes contribute to the nematode's development? What are the differences between the filaria larvae before it has been ingested by the mosquito and after it has been injected into the human host?",

            "comment": "Parasitologist here,\n\nFilarial nematode parasites, like many vector borne diseases, undergo several stages of development in their insect hosts. The microfilariae that are produced from adults have a protective sheath which is sloughed off in the mosquito / fly (for loa loa, onchocerciasis, etc)  midgut after taking a blood meal. These L1 stage worms, as far as we know, do not autoreinfect hosts probably because a) bad for the gene pool, and b) could overwhelm and kill the definitive host. Instead larvae (for lymphatic filariasis) migrate to the mosquito wing muscle, invade cells, and develop twice more to become infectious L3 stage worms which exit the muscle and migrate out onto the skin of the next host the mosquito feeds on. This L3 stage is primed to infect humans.\n\nThis kind of parasitism is common since it allows for horizontal transmission between definitive hosts. And if you are a parasite that needs to get to the bloodstream, what better way to get passed around than through a blood sucking insect?",

They had a mottled outside that had irregular patches of shiny black and jewel tones in yellow, red or orange and well proportioned translucent black wings. Absolutely evil creatures.  Before they bite you, they secrete a numbing agent which wears off just before they take the fangs (or whatever) out of your skin.  Then you notice them just before they fly away.  If you don't know what they are, the experience is\n\n1. Oh, pretty\n2. Hey, it landed on me\n3. Wow it's sitting there a while\n4. OH &amp;%#$&amp;\\^! that hurt!\n5. Bye\n6. I guess that explains why I take that pill every week\n\nAs someone who consumes a lot of science communication, I would say that your question is somewhat reversed.  You asked why THAT parasite HAS TO follow that vector.  The answer of course is that it doesn't have to.  It IS that parasite only because it happened upon this vector. It evolved then, in ways that further take advantage of the options available to it.  Any mutated ancestors who were not able to take advantage of their environment (human-&gt;mosquito/fly-&gt;human) didn't flourish.  If it had evolved a different vector or lifecycle, it would be a different creature.",

And they are quite nasty like horse flies in the way they bite. They have this sawblade kind of mouth.\n\nThere\u2019s also some pretty black flies that transmit river blindness filarial worms but they are pretty small and their bites are pretty nasty too.\n\nHope you are in good health! Ivermectin tends to do the trick to keep infections from developing and there\u2019s new treatments that might work to cure patent infections (see emodepside) though they aren\u2019t marketed yet.",

Or do they need to take a daily preventative like the old Filaribits? (Though that was diethylcarbamazine, not ivermectin, and less safe as well as less convenient, in dogs.) Are there topicals like selamectin (Revolution) that can be used instead of orals? Do infections with adult worms need to be treated with melarsomine injections? I just wonder how similar the whole situation is! (And I am very grateful to live in an area that has no known human-hosted filariasis, and where even the canine version is limited somewhat by a cold season that interrupts mosquito populations every year.)",

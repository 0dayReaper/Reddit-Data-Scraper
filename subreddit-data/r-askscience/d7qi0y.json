            "comment": "No, I don't think any telescope could come close.\n\nFor instance, Hubble has an angular resolution of about 1/10 of an arcsecond. It is approximately 384,000km from the moon. 1/10 arcsecond is 1/36000 of a degree, and a circle is 360 degrees. \n\n1/10 arcsecond on a circle with radius 384000 km is:\n\n2 * 384000 * pi / 360 / 36000 = 0.18617\n\nSo the resolution of Hubble would be 186m, much too large to make out a single human. To achieve the sub-1m resolution needed to discern a person on the moon, a telescope would need a resolution over 100 times better, which does not exist.",

                            "comment": "Due to the wave nature of light, there is an absolute lower limit on the angular resolution of imaging optics that is imposed by the aperture of the instrument, not the \"pixels\" in the detector. It's an issue caused by diffraction patterns in the image that obscure the source information. For a circular aperture, the formula is\n\n\u0398 = 1.22 x \u03bb/D\n\nWhere \u0398 is the angular resolution of the instrument, \u03bb is the wavelength of light that you are focusing, and D is the diameter of the aperture.\n\nThis means that there is a lower limit on the angular distance between two points of light that can be resolved (distinguished) by an instrument. This is called the resolving power of the instrument, and it has nothing to do with the detector (pixels) that record the image. It's all dependant on the wavelength of incident light and the diameter of the aperture.\n\nAs an example, you are unable to notice with the naked eye that the north star is, in fact, two stars because the diameter of your pupil is too small to resolve the double. You can easily resolve them with a pair of binoculars, though. It happens that Polaris is a triple, a fact not discovered until 1929 by analyzing the spectrum of light from the system.\n\n[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_resolution) is the skinny on optical resolution.",

Even if those other things are absolutely perfect, so perfect that a physicist would blush at assuming such ideal materials in a model, a telescope of a certain size absolutely cannot do better than its theoretical maximum angular resolution.\n\nNow, you can \"cheat\" that a little bit by using several telescopes in different locations and then using a computer to pretend that the several telescopes are actually just one big giant telescope. If you do that, you can get an effective telescope size of miles or even hundreds of miles. However, the downside is that you aren't collecting any light in the areas between the telescopes and so you can only see extremely bright objects.\n\nThat's how radio telescope networks work. You can get crazy big effective telescope size (and therefore crazy small angular resolution) by hooking up a dozen radio telescopes all across the world, but can only see very \"bright\" objects that emit lots and lots of radio waves. Fortunately, because there do exist extremely bright radio sources, that's a thing that astronomers actually do do.",

Dots per inch is a measurement of how dense you can _print_ images, not a representation of the image itself.\n\nConsider a picture you take on your phone. It has a single field of view, so 1 pixel in the resulting image represents the light observed in that tiny angular sliver of the field of view from your phones camera. When you take a picture of your friend 5 feet away, that angular sliver of light might represent a tiny freckle on their cheek, but the exact same angle over their shoulder could widen out to a mountain top on the horizon. Both end up being 1 pixel in the image.",

Push you face against a wall and it looks infinitely big because the edges are perpendicular to the direction of your vision. Back away and it gets smaller as the relative angle between the center of your view and the edges of the wall shrinks. Eventually that angle gets so small that the object effectively disappears.",

At the distance to the Moon, that translates to a resolution of 1.22 feet.\n\nTl;dr: Yes, we can do it, but there's only one facility on Earth with the capability. The cool thing is that anyone can apply for time on this telescope, so you could go on their website and actually ask them to do this experiment.",

Wasn't Hubble a gift to NASA from the NRO or at least based on a design that was technically, for it's time, a previous gen keyhole satellite?  I remember from somewhere [that Hubble is almost 1:1 a KH-11 keyhole satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KH-11_Kennen) that is pointed at the stars rather than Earth.  In addition to this, aren't the replacements for Hubble supposed to be built around handy down keyhole sats given to NASA by the NRO.  It's impossible to get information on the current gen of keyhole sats, or even that they exist other than rumors, but 100 times more powerful than 1970s technology doesn't seem that extreme.\n\nFrom seeing a few of the imaging sensors developed for current/next gen NRO assets and with all the optical lens breakthroughs over the past decade and a half that get announced then acquired for exclusive use for US defense... it doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility that the tech exists but just isn't available for use outside the intelligence community.\n\n^(edit: added link)",

Spy satellites that can get sub-meter resolution imagery are usually in an orbit that is only a few hundred miles above the earth, while the moon is several hundred thousand miles away. If we put one in orbit of the moon we could absolutely see astronauts walking around, but that's not really what the question is about.",

You measure the angle to the object from point A, the angle from point B, and the distance between A and B to draw a triangle. The longer your baseline from A to B the more accurate you can get. We currently do this by using the orbit of the earth as a baseline - measuring once in midsummer and once in midwinter for example.",

To resolve something to that level of detail would require an imaging system that was 10+m in diameter. No rocket can launch something that large, and if they did manage to unfold it in orbit, it would stick out to earth based observers like a sore thumb. A much more reasonable expectation is about what we saw leaked in the tweet by president dum dum. About 30cm resolution, which jives with the size that is practically launchable and the known orbits of the intelligence satellites.",

The total amount of light that hits the walls of that balloon is the same, no matter how much you inflate the balloon. But, as you inflate the balloon, the amount of surface area is increasing. So the amount of light per unit area is decreasing, even as the total stays the same. \n\nIf you imagine light as rays being emitted from the candle, these rays are diverging. That is, the distance between the rays gets further apart.\n\nWhen you set up a telescope lense, what you're doing is bending Ray's back together. Depending on how far away the telescope is, you need a bigger lens to force the same number of rays to converge onto your camera. \n\nSo, yes, the light doesn't diminish, but it does diverge. If you don't collect enough rays from different angles, your image ends up all blurry even with a long exposure.",

Lots of light leaks through the holes, but what doesn't leak gets reflected to the eyepiece just the same as a whole mirror. However, because there are so many holes in the mirror, there is less light in the eyepiece and therefore the picture is dimmer.\n\nThe holes in the mirror represent the gaps between the various telescopes that are being networked together.",

They were the VC behind Intrinsic Graphics and later Keyhole Inc. They used to be called Peleus, are one of the biggest players in the silicon valley VC game, and are actually [a front for the American CIA.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-Q-Tel)\n\nThey hold major stakes in a long list of non-publicly traded (no SEC disclosures to public required) American tech companies.  The list of their holdings is far from complete but there is a sizeable list of companies known to the public at this point.  Due to acquisitions by Google of various In-Q-Tel companies and the fact that they have been major investors in every search engine startup since the beginning of the dot com boom, it is safe to assume that some of Google's board seats are owned by In-Q-Tel shell companies.  This is why the recent resignations and protests by Google employees over Google openly working on projects for the US military and intelligence community were so entertaining and more than a little ironic.\n\nThe list of imaging sensor, image processing, video processing, and adaptive optics technology companies that they have ownership in is the reason I have a strong suspicion that the NRO has found a workaround for the physical limitations holding back orbital telescopes from achieving sub 100m resolution in a compact package.  From the tech some of those companies made public before they were acquired... the claims by former US military analysts of being able to read newspaper headlines or lips from geostationary orbit, ie sub 1m resolution, don't feel too crazy in 2019.\n\nIntrinsic Graphics and Keyhole Inc weren't the first game company that In-Q-Tel was behind.  In-Q-Tel being the VC behind Niantic Games, the creator of Pokemon Go, is the reason most countries (other than the US) banned citizens from playing the game near goverment and military installations.  All around I found the whole concept of a popular Pokemon game released by the CIA instructing kids to record various geographical locations with their smartphone camera to be extra clever.\n\nIn-Q-Tel is also a major investor in Docker Inc, the company behind the wildly popular software container platform.",

The angle/distance at which this happens is the resolution of the system.  \n\n\n186m resolution here means that at the distance of the moon, the telescope could only tell objects apart on a scale larger than 186 meters.

There isn't that many telescopes attached to this system, and so the data we receive isn't really complete, requiring maths to reconstruct certain sections of the image.  possible to do this with a gravitational object, not so much with a face/space suit.\n\nSecond, the amount of time you'd need to track one spot would be inordinately impractical.  You'd have to track the object on several telescopes (that have other tasks as well) for at least a day if not days.  This means your little man would have to not move, for the whole day/days.",

            "comment": "I'm an astrophysicist, and I believe the answer is: ~~yes~~ maybe.\n\nFirst we need to calculate the angular size of a \\~2 meter astronaut on the moon. We can do this easily on [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%282+meters%29+%2F+%28distance+to+the+moon%29%29+radians+to+milliarcseconds): we find that the astronaut is about 1.04 milliarcseconds.\n\nAs other users have pointed out, no single telescope is large enough to have this kind of angular resolution. Hubble is about a 100x too small. Typically, to resolve an object, you need the resolution to be at most half of the object's size. So you'd need a resolution of &lt; 0.5 milliarcseconds.\n\nBut you don't need a telescope 100x bigger than Hubble to have 100x Hubble's resolution. An interferometer is an array of telescopes that have the light-gathering power of their total mirror areas, but the effective angular resolution is determined by their most-separated elements.\n\nThe most powerful optical interferometer in the world is the [CHARA array](http://www.chara.gsu.edu/public/instrumentation/31-the-chara-array), located on Mt. Wilson. It's a series of six, 1-meter telescopes that are about 330 meters apart (at longest separation). This means it has the resolution of a 330 meter telescope! CHARA has an angular resolution of 0.2 milliarcseconds, which should be plenty to detect our astronauts.\n\nUPDATE (7 hours later): Someone asked a question that led me to think of an obvious concern: while the astronaut be bright enough to be visible by a small telescope array like CHARA?\n\nThe moon reflects [\\~12% of the light](https://www.universetoday.com/19981/moon-albedo/) that hits it. Let's assume an astronaut is wearing a classic white spacesuit. That reflects [\\~80% of the light](https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/29901/why-were-eva-suits-never-silver) that hits it. Let's say then, that for equal angular sizes, astronauts are 6x brighter than the moon's surface. The moon has a surface brightness of [\\~4](https://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~phiscock/astronomy/light-pollution/moon-brightness.pdf) [mag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude)/arcsecond^(2). If an astronaut has an angular size of \\~1 mas, then let's say they have a solid angle of \\~1 mas^(2). Then they are [6 x 1 mas^(2) / 1 arcsecond^(2) = 6E-6](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=6+*+%281+square+milliarcsecond+%2F+1+square+arcsecond%29+) times fainter than a square arcsecond of the moon. Which means their apparent magnitude is \\~[13](https://www.vcalc.com/wiki/sspickle/Difference+in+magnitudes+from+Flux+Ratio)\\+4 = 17.\n\nWhat sort of exposure time is needed to see a 17th mag object? Well, on the [Kitt Peak National Observatory 0.9 m telescope](https://www.noao.edu/gateway/ccdtime/), it looks like to get a signal-to-noise ratio of 10, we need a an exposure time of 0.7 seconds. But CHARA has 6 telescopes that are a bit bigger at 1.0 meters, so lets call this (0.7/6) \\* (1.0/0.9)\\^2 = \\~0.1 seconds. But I'm going to assume that optical interferometry is more lossy than a simple imager, like in the KPNO example. So let's just arbitrarily bump this up to 0.2 seconds.\n\nI'm not certain what sort of exposure time is necessary for a ground-based telescope like CHARA to work well is. But their [user's manual has an example](http://chara.gsu.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=chara:pavo_user_manual&amp;s[]=exposure) where they use an exposure time of 8 ms. Now, is this fast exposure time needed in order to be smaller than the timescale of atmospheric variations? If so, then it's hopeless for our astronaut project.\n\nBut, if it's instead the case that CHARA had a rapid exposure time in this example because their target is very bright, then we may still be in business. CHARA might be observing bright targets because they are **big** (because they are close, which is also why they are bright), rather than because they can only see bright things. In this case, CHARA could afford to take slightly longer exposure times of \\~0.2 seconds for our astronaut, even if that's a bit slower than the atmospheric coherence timescale (which is usually taken to be 0.01 to 0.1 seconds or so, depending on lots of stuff).\n\nSo, because I don't know CHARA's upper limit for exposure time (if there is one), I must offer an unsatisfying conclusion of \"Maybe.\"\n\nEDIT: had the wrong link for CHARA initially. Fixed now.",

Since the EHT uses radio wavelengths, they are able to measure and record the phases and amplitudes of the radio photons received (as well as their arrival time). They save this to a bunch of hard drives, and ship them to a computing center which looks at the data and combines it all after the fact. By contrast, we don't have the ability to measure optical photons in this much detail. Therefore, to do optical interferometry, you need to look at the actual interference pattern from the photons. This means you need a special dedicated facility that combines the optical photons from each telescope.",

The event horizon telescope is able to get the angular resolution required as it had a resolution of 25 microarcseconds, but it was in radio frequencies.  You could do it in optical domain too, but it's a lot harder and they are just starting to implement this technique in optical regimes instead of radio. \n\nIt is also not exactly a traditional image, but an interferogram, but still produces a image. The moon may be bright enough as well in the daytime to have short enough exposures to support a movie too.\n\nBut this is very very hard!

So, using very established science, we've devised other ways.\n\nRight now, there's a series of retroreflectors on the surface of the Moon. We know their exact positions; and you can shine a well-focused laser on them, and it will bounce back to you. If you're off, say, 1m away from the retroreflector, the signal doesn't come back. Not only is this absolute proof we've been to the Moon, it provides a rather accurate way to measure the 'wobble' of the Moon, and how far away it is.\n\nWhen we return to the Moon with Artemis, it would be trivial to set up a simple microwave antenna to broadcast what's going on. Maybe a solar array and battery, with a small camera, and have a 'live feed' 24/7 till it gets hit by something, or fries because of the solar radiation. You'd only be able to tune-in when it's facing you. And, because it's so simple, anyone could tune in provided they have a 3m satellite dish.",

Kitt Peak has seen the descent stages of Apollo 15 and Apollo 16.\n\nHowever, we have the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has imaged Apollo landing sites at 0.5 metre resolution. That's enough to see a human in a space suit!\n\nThere are also ways to increase visibility.

That's the diffraction limit of a 39m telescope anyway. Hubble doesn't have to worry about an atmosphere, but it's only 2.4m across, and even LUVOIR, one of the proposed next generation space telescope for the 2030s, is \"only\" 15m across (even that's only at the most ambitious level). The largest telescopes we can build will always be on the ground, because the ground is cheaper and big telescopes are more expensive. That matters because the atmosphere has turbulence that smears out images, called the \"seeing\", which even at the best sites in the world is around 1-arcsecond of angular size - human 20/20 vision can resolve about 60 arcseconds, for reference. That can be corrected for to a degree, but not enough to really get to the diffraction limit, and not over anything remotely resembling a wide field of view.\n\nSo no, there are no telescopes on Earth strong enough today or in our lifetimes that will be strong enough to watch astronauts walking around on the moon from Earth or Earth orbit.",

Currently, the largest telescope is the Keck Telescope in Hawaii, with a lens diameter of 10 meters. \n\nIn order to calculate the size of the smallest object that we can see we first have to calculate the resolution:\n\nResolution \\[radians\\] = (wavelength)/(telescope diameter)\n\nIn our case we can assume wavelength is 600 nm because the range of visible light is 400-700 nm. Resolution = (600E-9)/(10)=6E-8 radians.\n\nTo put this into a contest we can understand, we can use trig to draw a triangle with two points on the moon and the point on earth. The length of the distance between the two points on the moon (x) is the length of an object that the telescope will be able to see. \n\nx=tan(Resolution)(distance to moon \\[km\\]) \n\nx=tan(6E-8)(384,400)=0.023064 km. \n\nConvert this to meters and we are given 23.064 meters (75 feet) as the smallest object we can see on the moon from the strongest telescope on earth.

    "postText": "Gravity attracts particles which increases the locality of particles which seems to decrease entropy. But according to the second law, entropy of the universe always increases. For example as star dust coagulates into a macroscopic object. Why?\n\nSimilarly for other forces like the electric attraction between an electron and proton seems to reduce the phase-space of their joint spatial configurations which seems to reduce entropy?\n\nHow do we reconcile the fundamental forces with the second law that entropy always increases?",

            "comment": "The state of a system is specified by the positions and velocities (or momenta) of its particles, not the positions alone. Accordingly, a system's entropy -- which counts the number of particle configurations -- involves an integral over the system's volume *in 6-dimensional position-velocity space*, not just 3-dimensional position space. Gravitational collapse compresses a system in position space, but the infalling particles gain velocity. This is why the entropy does not decrease.\n\nEdit: I should add that the above is true in situations where the system's energy is conserved, like the collapse of primordial regions of excess density into dark matter halos. In many situations, like galaxy, star, and planet formation, energy is not conserved because some is radiated away during the process. In that scenario the system can lose entropy, but if you also include the entropy of the radiation, total entropy still does not decrease.",

In Open system entropy MAY decrease.\n\nThen, you should consider not only mass but also energy.\nGravity does not increase or decrease entropy - gravity just exists.\nDue to the existing of gravity there appears a potential energy. An when matter collapses entropy increases by decreasing potential energy by irradiating it as a heat.\n\nIf I'm wrong I'll gladly hear the correct version.",

Like gravity will increase a system's velocity until it reaches a singularity, in which case it's velocity then reaches zero. However then a black hole forms and begins to evaporate into Hawkins radiation, which continues to raise the entropy. Is this anywhere near accurate?",

            "comment": "I think our understanding of abiogenesis and early biochemistry/early Earth chemistry is too speculative to know this in any detail.  We only know what \u201csteps\u201d must have occurred in the broadest possible sense, with a lot of the historical details unknown and perhaps unknowable, given the fact that any evidence (except that surviving in modern genomes) would be very unlikely to survive the past few billion years.\n\nHowever, what I\u2019ve imagined is that the \u201ceasy\u201d steps - like forming amino acids, nucleobases, and so forth - would have happened all over the Earth simultaneously, or at least everywhere that conditions were conducive to it.  The \u201chard\u201d steps like forming the first self-replicating polymer or forming the first ribosome-like system might have happened in a single location (e.g. a tide pool somewhere), after millions of years of \u201cattempts\u201d in many similar locations.  Then, that \u201csuccess\u201d would spread to other locations, and another span of millions of years might pass before the next \u201chard\u201d step happened somewhere.",

It seems likely to me that there were many, many precursors to the ribosome, and likely other lineages of ribosome-like systems that went \"extinct\" early in Earth's history because they were less efficient.  Even a small difference in efficiency for something so fundamental would result in being out-competed for resources by more efficient systems.\n\nThe ribosome seems incredibly complex in an irreducible way, but that's likely because the simpler, more crude versions didn't survive to modern times for us to be aware of them.\n\nEdit: It's still a cool idea to contemplate finding some pocket of lithotrophic organisms deep in the Earth's crust that has been isolated from other life for billions of years and might have some very different biochemistry than any extant species.  But so far, no evidence that such life forms exist at all.",

Maybe also minerals to serve as matrix for synthesis. \n\nFor where would all of that could be present at once - perhaps a very shallow sea. With the absence of such thing as soil there are no rivers and rains quickly erode seashore into a wast knee deep swamp-like landscape that is neither land nor sea like how we usually see them now. Such landscapes could be common on primordial Earth, just not all of it. Deep sea doesn't contain much organics or any sunlight even now.",

Possibly many succeeded, but died out very early. Of those that survived, meeting another form would typically result in the elimination of one. The fact that all living organisms share so many features suggest that either one ancestral group gave rise to all current life forms, or that the specific features like DNA and proteins carry such a massive advantage that they arose multiple times.",

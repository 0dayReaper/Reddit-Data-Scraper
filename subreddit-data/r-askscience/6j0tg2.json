Let's hope your knowledge helps prevent horrible incidents like these in future.\n\nEdit2: Quite a lot of responses here also about the legitimacy of the field of fire investigation.

For instance, some polymer flooring materials can melt during a fire and form burning pools of molten plastic that leave pretty much identical marks to what you expect to find if someone poured gasoline on the floor.\n\nWe always take samples to be chemically analyzed (i think by gas spectroscopy?) in order to verify or disprove any theories of accelerant use. Control samples must be taken from spots where you don't suspect anything, and of course there may be benign reasons for an accelerant to be present (like a bottle of lamp oil or booze or whatever stored somewhere near where the fire started).\n\nMost importantly fire investigation must always be done as a process of elimination, trying to disprove all possible causes until you're hopefully only left with one. Starting with a theory and trying to prove it is a recipe for miscarriage of justice.\n\nOh, and people do sometimes set stuff on fire for the insurance money. Oftentimes they get away with it too- but greed often gets them eventually. Statiastically few people suffer more than one fire in their lifetime, so when a guy files his sixth fire insurance someone is going to ask pointed questions (real world example there; one man claimed to have lost multiple boats and buildings in mysterious fires over a couple of decades. The fires would always start when some renovation project ground to a standstill or expensive repairs were needed).",

The samples are placed in new, unused paint cans for storage. Samples are then taken from these and the headspace gases collected and run through a gas chromatograph in order to separate them. These compounds come off the column at different times based on their affinity for the type of column that is used. That's separation.\n\nAfter that comes detection. One method (flame ionization detector) simply burns it in a hydrogen flame. Organic compounds cause that flame to become conductive, and that conductivity is proportional to the amount of organic material in the flow stream (for certain concentrations- too high or too low, this is no longer true).\n\nHowever, GC/FID only says *something* is coming off the column, and while it's pretty decent science, it's not *court-valid* science in that it could be *anything* coming off the column at that time. For orthogonal detection (time *and* mass fragments) you need mass spectrum detection. The compounds coming off the column are smacked around with a stream of electrons (usually- there are other techniques), and that turns the compounds into ions. These ions are then sorted by mass (mass to charge ratio, actually), and the pattern formed by these compounds is unique- or nearly so- to the compound(s) in question. From this, some arson residue might have specific compounds found in gasoline, and unless the presence of gasoline could be explained some other way (refilling the lawnmower in the living room?), that would be consistent with the presence of an accelerant.\n\n[John DeHaan](http://fire-exforensics.com/) got his doctorate in how the ratio of hydrocarbons change in fire debris based on time and temperature, IIRC.

The questions to be answered here are engineering ones - why a cladding material that would have been designed and tested as safe proved to be so unsafe in practice.\n\nBut even in less obvious cases, the source of the ignition is often obvious. When ignition happens, there is lots of oxygen there, so things burn completely. When the fire gets going, there's less oxygen available, so things burn partially. Fire generally burns up - so the source of a fire is often the only thing on the floor that is badly burned.\n\nEdit: Lots of good replies to my comment - including some fire investigators that state that the source of the fire is usually less combusted than the surroundings, as they burn cooler before the fire gets going.",

Fire investigation used to be considered an \"art\" ... it is now science based, using the scientific method to form and test hypotheses of how fires start. It is extremely unfortunate and sad that criminal proceedings have been based on investigation methods that were nothing more than wives' tales. It is fortunate, however, that the fire investigation community has developed into the science/fact based investigation community that it is today.\n\nEdit: I need to add some info here about the legitimacy of the fire investigation field - Being that fire investigation is based on the scientific method, I have to conclude that fire investigation is not in fact a junk science. I do agree with the many people, however, that there are plenty of junk fire investigators who base their decisions on junk science (hypotheses that are not tested properly, experiments that are not done properly, wives tales and lore). But this is not to say that all fire investigators are wizards with a magic water stick pointing their way to the origin of a fire. \n\nThere are a large number of fire investigators who are dedicated to true fire investigation and the scientific method, and to furthering the field with experimentation. I think that saying all fire investigation is junk and illegitimate is doing those men and women a disservice. ",

This is why certification and accreditation is so important. \n\nEdit: I must add that any of these \"investigators\" who have a part in any potential criminal proceedings like charging someone with arson, will not be accepted into the court of law as an expert witness. They will most definitely fail any Daubert challenge or Frye hearing. There is much case law about fire investigation.",

Also burn patterns tend to radiate outwards so you can track them back sometimes. Need to be a trained eye for it though since fire will burn quicker through certain materials and you have to account for the fire getting to an area faster by a non-direct route.",

Imagine coating the exterior of the building in solidified form of gasoline.\n\nDuring this era, there was a hubris about fire protection.  \"Hey, the building is fully protected with fire sprinklers.  What could go wrong?\"\n\nWell, as it turns out, sprinklers don't do jack shit on the exterior of the building.  Once the facade ignites, the results are often catastrophic.\n\n[Here's a facade fire in Beijing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hSPFL2Zlpg)\n[Here's another in Dubai.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-L3TUzZU7Ys)\n\nI don't know much about European or Asian building codes.  But here in the US, we have adopted a new test standard known as NFPA 285.  The idea is to specifically prevent facade fires.\n\nThere have been many changes implemented.  For example, we never use expanded polystyrene insulation... Always use Mineral wool insulation.\n\nNever use EIFS on buildings over a certain height.  Stuff like that.\n\nSource.. Architect\n\n\n",

The other sections of the building, having adequate fire protection (determined by code) from the section with the alarm activation, will not activate. ",

Once on scene we pay attention to where most of the smoke and fire production is coming from, and after extinguishing the fire we look for stuff like \"V\" patterns on the wall, alligatoring (aka charring) on wood, melted plastic etc which is usually pretty good indicator of what direction the fire spread from and work almost like arrows pointing in the direction of the original source, after that we can narrow it down, we let the investigator know and then they probe deeper with looking/testing for signs of accelerants, looking at wiring, etc",

Fire patterns - the observable or measurable shapes or patterns left by fire effects. \n2. Fire dynamics - the behavior of fire in terms of fuel, ventilation, compartment size etc. \n3. Witness statements\n4. Arc mapping - the locating and mapping of electrical faults on circuits that were energized at the time of the fire. \n\nObviously, you need to find the origin before you can find the cause. Typically if you can identify the origin to an accurate degree, the cause will be identifiable to specialists of that potential cause (e.g. Electrical or mechanical engineers). ",

A lot of buildings now have what are called truss roofs.  One beam is stretched from wall to wall and smaller beams are fanned out from the center of the beam to support the roof.  To attach the supports most of the time, an aluminum plate is attached and get this, staples or rivets are used, not nails.  \n\nWhen a fire is hot enough, it will make the plate expand, causing the staples/rivets to \"pop out\", making this metallic pinging noise.  If you hear that noise, you need to get out NOW because the roof is coming down.  Construction doesn't include the attic vent sometimes.  This vent is designed to allow the flow of superheated gases to escape the top of the house, preventing a flashover.  Everything is made of plastic nowadays, some which burns at 1200 F, while your turnout gear is good to 800 F.  So many dangers to be aware of in fires nowadays.  I love it when people ask me if I have a fear of being immolated.  I always tell them that I'm too busy thinking of other things, to be worried about that.",

Only when his team came out did they realise the fire had already spread to the upper floors. They had all supposed the materials used in the building would have contained the fire to a fairly small compartment. This was the main reason the insulation and cladding was very quickly questioned and found to be at fault.\n",

            "comment": "Fire investigation is an art and detective case all in one. \nIn a nutshell during fire operations in the back of every firefighters mind is preserving evidence and limiting water damage to the scene to ensure fire investigators can do their job. After the fire has been extinguished we start what is called salvage and overhaul. Overhaul is searching for hidden fires and hot spots. I won't go too in depth on overhaul because it's not pertinent. Keep in mind like I said before salvage is taking place the entirety of the operation. Now in this instance where a structure is so fully involved it makes it more difficult to find the source of the fire but the same principles and steps are still carried out. Fire investigators will start from the outside of the structure and move in and towards the source. Some things they may be looking out for is darkened roofing, fire trails, etc. for example lighting fixtures and furniture will point you to the source. If a piece of furniture is burnt up the most destroyed blackened area acts like an arrow to the origin of the fire. You follow what you can see until you typically find the most destroyed burnt area of a structure and you can usually call that the point of origin. Firefighters and investigators are always on the lookout for arson. Some ways to identify arson include, fire trails, empty gas canisters, fuel lines, accelerants, civilians near the scene who consistently appear at fires and tend to appear sketchy. People who set structures or anything really on fire tend to like to admire their work which can often be their downfall. Some other signs could be all important documents, expensive jewelry, electronics etc all missing from the structure which could be a sign of insurance fraud, especially if weeks prior the owner for some reason invested in fire coverage and took out a large insurance policy on their home etc. There are 4 different types of fire cause, natural, accidentally, arson, and undetermined.  In this case when it was determined it was an electrical source I can only assume some signs they noticed were, a v shape near the outlet of the fridge which indicates a short in the appliance, they may notices signs of arcing and beading around wiring. I could go on and on for days but if you want to know more I can always send you messages. \nAlso note I've only been in the fire service for just around 3 years now. \n2 years Fire explorer in California and 1 year DOD firefighter in Anchorage Alaska. So if anyone would care to share more informations I would be happy to learn\nHere's a glossary of a couple of words you may not be familiar with (not to insult intelligence)\nAccelerants: a substance used to aid the spread of fire\nArcing: luminous discharge of current that is formed when a strong current jumps a gap in a circuit or between two electrodes.",

            "comment": "When wires get overloaded to the point that they start a fire they will often show signs of arcing. That is the electricity in the wire leaping from the wire to another conductive object will leave traces of that occurring because copper has a low melting point. Cut wires have a clean edge and arced ones have bulbus ends from where the wire has partially melted.",

            "comment": "There are lots of indicators at a fire.\n\nFor instance, heat rises and radiates, so damage from a fire will be in a cone shape, back to the area of origin.\n\nAlso, different metals melt at different temperatures.  so if here you have aluminum and brass melted, and there you have just brass melted, it was hotter here.\n\nAlso, glass and plastic containers will be melted more on the side facing the fire, causing them to \"point\" to the area of origin.\n\nSo yes, there is quite a lot you can learn from investigating the scene of a fire.",

                    "comment": "Alas, some of those indicators will point to where the  fire was hottest rather than to where it started. If one area has more flammable materials and/or more oxygen, the fire will flare up and burn hotter there. \n\nDamned easy to be fooled by this sort of thing. \nI recently examined a room where all the classic signs pointed to one area where the occupant had stored a large amount of candles. Fire didn't start there at all, but all those candles added fire energy equivalent to a gallon of gasoline in a small area. Of course the fire burned hotter there! Oh, and the candles had all been totally consumed by the fire; get wax hot enough and it evaporatea completely without leaving any molten wax behind.\n\nAs for the cone shape, yeah that is sometimes reliable though you have to check for falling or dripping material spreading fire downwards to cause secondary cones/fans. Often the fire started at the lowest spot burnt, but molten stuff can confuse that picture. I once followed a seemingly classic telltale V shape downwards inside a wall, only to find lumps of molten aluminium. Some alu facade panels had melted and dripped downwards, hot enough to ignite secondary fires.",

            "comment": "Two of the most common techniques are calcination depth measurements using a constant force to determine the area of highest temperature exposure using gypsum wallboard and arc mapping if they suspect an electrical fire.\n\n\"The dehydration reaction, also known as calcination, is an endothermic decomposition reaction which occurs between 100 C and 120 C. When gypsum is heated in a fire, the dehydration follows the reaction in Equation 1.1 as solid gypsum starts to degrade, loses its strength and is eventually transformed back to the powdery material of calcium sulphate hemihydrate.\" http://www.civil.canterbury.ac.nz/fire/pdfreports/Chu04.pdf\n\nArc mapping can be found on wikipedia, but it's simply a technique to identify the first location two energized wires melted and arced.",

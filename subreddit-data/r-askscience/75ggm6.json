            "comment": "This is called bioregenerative life support, and in falls in the broader category of Environmental Control and Life Support Systems (ECLSS). Short answer is yes, but not infinite and not without disadvantages.\n\nNote that plants aren't the only way to recycle oxygen. Currently they use water electrolysis to inject oxygen into their atmosphere, and use the resulting hydrogen to apply the Sabatier reaction with CO2. This yields methane as a waste product, and captures oxygen from CO2 in the form of water, so they can later apply electrolysis again and recycle oxygen.\n\nA clear advantage of using plants would be trapping carbon into edible forms, so you'd be recycling not only oxygen but also food. However, not all plants have a 100% edible mass, and those who do usually offer very few calories if not negligible (e.g. lettuce).\n\nA problem with plants is that they could die under some conditions, so this system isn't 100% reliable. And in any case, whether bioregenerative or artificially regenerative, you can never achieve a 100% reuse of ECLSS resources. But it's ok, you can get close enough and have them for a long time relying on very little supplies.\n\nThey are actively researching on this topic. Recently they've been able to grow lettuce in the ISS.\n",

Most likely that it depends a lot on what you're planning to plant, and everyone has a different concept for that. How many plants is even harder to answer because they range a lot in size (i.e. you can have many small plants or few big ones).\n\nWhat they all agree is that each person needs around 2500 kcal/day of food and 0.5-0.8 kg/day of oxygen.",

So at some point you would either have an abundance of oxygen (when fires would easily start) or a deficit. If the plants are just meant as a supplement that's all well and fine, but if you're planning to switch them out completely that becomes another issue to plan around.",

The biggest problem you actually have is watering plants, as well as the gravitropic response (roots down, plant up).  With no gravity, you tend to have some unusual effects.  We actually have a small centrifuge on many of our tests to generate artificial gravity, but large scale is obviously difficult.  I don't think there's enough space for this to be feasible on the ISS or deep space missions.\n",

Every time you add mass you are increasing the cost of building and moving the space ship or station.  Ships have to accelerate at least twice per trip, and stations need to periodically adjust their orbits. This is besides the cost of the extra materials themselves. You are also adding complexity, which has its own problems. Simpler is always better, all other things being equal. As you add literal layers of complexity you are adding potential points of failure and cost of maintenance. Not to say you shouldn't do it, but it's not simply better to do this. ",

Plants still have to digest those sugars and they do it the same way you and I do: aerobic respiration. Of course, plants produce far more sugars than they digest (because their \"flesh\" is made of sugar), and so produce more oxygen than they consume, but only when the sun is out.",

Constant daylight may produce some wonky plants, but I imagine this would vary a lot by species.\n\nHowever, this is all a bit moot, since not all plants consume net O2 at night anyway. The solution is to plant a number of [CAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crassulacean_acid_metabolism) plants, which absorb CO2 at night instead of during the day. With the right ratios I'm sure you can keep atmospheric gases mostly constant. You need a pretty obsessed gardener to keep on top of things, though.",

The main problem is that it's quite dense, and you need a lot of it to do anything particularly valuable. A ton of water is only ~265 gallons, which really isn't that much when you think about it. \n\nIf you're trying to mine water from a near Earth asteroid to build your space station algae farm, you'd need around 3.26km/s delta-V each way (assuming your station and your mining vessel both start in LEO). Let's say you want to move 40 tons of water (roughly 1 tanker truck), and you're using a LH2/LOx engine with a vac ISP of roughly 450 for propulsion. Empty, your vehicle weighs an incredibly optimistic 10 tons (including the tanks, mining equipment, life support, etc). A round trip would burn roughly 100 tons of fuel. \n\nWhile that's a *lot* cheaper than the 650 or so tons of fuel you'd need to launch that water from the surface, it's still pretty significant. The logical thing to do would be to use electrolysis to generate H2 and O2 from water in orbit, but then you'd need to haul even *more* water and equipment around. Never mind the fact that you'd still have to figure out how to store the resulting fuels, since cryogenic fuels aren't really storable without getting really creative. \n\nMining water (and other materials) in orbit will open up tons of new possibilities, but mass is still mass. Moving enough water to create a radiation shield and/or algae farm will be a hugely expensive undertaking regardless of where you get the water from.",

Already outside of it.\n\nHow much thrust can we get out of separating some of the water into hydrogen and oxygen with electricity from solar cells and using that as fuel? How much thrust can we get by simply heating some of it up and using the steam as propellant? That also might be a good way to get rid of some of the methane, ammonia and other stuff we're going to get that we don't need.\n\nIf we schedule and plan everything properly we really don't need our cargo to move very fast.\n\nAlso, I didn't imagine this thing would need a human crew. A drone with some independent decision-making ability could do the job. At least after we had a few years experience and knew the likely problems it was going to run into.\n\nOf course I'm just writing science fiction at this point.

Someone like me though, 6'1 and works out eats literally triple that. Even if I don't I still need double them. My oxygen consumption would also be triple theirs then, wouldn't it?\n\nHmm although in theory someone with like 50 extra pounds on them that only needs 1200/cal a day if they weren't overweight could go on like 700/cal a day for about a year. Hmm but at the same time you could just take that extra 50lbs on board as lard or fat outside of the person that they just mix in with their food and achieve the same thing but they aren't lugging around that extra 50lbs and will use less energy/oxygen/food. So I think using very short very skinny women would be most efficient. Even midgets, too. You could have guys then.",

The new fertilizer being tested had a slower and more even release rate, which had helped lower the plants' accumulation of salts during ground studies. Investigators expected to see higher salt accumulation in the space modules, but the opposite occurred.  https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/10-074.html\n",

In fact, you kind of have to decide if you'd like the plants to focus on growing leaves for oxygen production or fruits for food production. Either way, there are a lot of challenges in feeding those plants. We proposed using composters to recycle human waste to make the system fully sustainable, as plants \"breathe\" pure water out which could then be utilized as drinking water as well. I don't know all the details about that part of it, as that wasn't my section. We also intended to use Fresnel lenses with fiber optic cables to deliver sunlight directly to the plants, with blue and red LEDs as a backup (it'd be placed underground because the moon lacks an atmosphere to burn up space debris).\n\nUnfortunately, hydroponics would have difficulty in a low gravity environment like the ISS without some real specialized design, which the plants may not like. The moon would give us an environment that is a little more familiar to us and the plants. \n\nEdit: the guys in charge of it did an AMA a couple years ago if anyone wants to look around for more info without leaving Reddit: [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3npxoj/move_over_hollywood_we_are_roberto_furfaro_and/?st=J8LQQOVW&amp;sh=91652fb3) ",

Gravity effects the plants development over time because its important when establishing the architecture of a growing plant, which becomes more out of whack as it grows. Genetic modification could overcome these problems, maybe even traditional space breeding too, but the largest hurdles to plants in micro gravity is cultivation practices. How will nutrients be delivered, how will the atmosphere be maintained etc.  Some very creative genetic modification can be employed to potentially grow plants in situations that dont work well currently",

Obviously, down means soil. Without gravity, plants become lost and will have more difficulty growing, resulting in limp produce.\n\nWhile there has been some success, growing plants in space is still unreliable, but will improve in the near future.",

                            "comment": "Spin gravity straight up eliminates *many* problems associated with long duration spaceflight, notably the muscular and skeletal degradation caused by prolonged weightlessness. Similarly, problems among plants caused by lack of apparent gravity would be solved in much the same way.\n\nThe difficulties mostly come from the fact that many of the historical reasons why we send things to space are to study how they behave in the absence of gravity. So most concepts for a rotating space station prefer to leave at least a portion of the structure *not* rotate.\n\nSealing a constantly rotating section like that to prevent air from escaping is tricky. And depending on the mass of the rotating portion, objects moving around inside of it can throw off the center of rotation, making the rotating and stationary segments shake as it spins. You can solve *that* problem by building movable counterweights into the structure of the spinning section, and the larger you build the segment the less small movements matter anyways.\n\nSpinning produces some interesting effects for people moving about in such a section, however. If the diameter is too small, there would be a significant difference in acceleration from your head to your toes. Additionally, the spin rate must be much higher to generate the same amount of force as a with a longer centrifuge.\n\nTurning your head while standing in such an environment can also cause some disorientation. One side of your head will be turning into the spin, increasing its speed and thus sensation of gravity, while the other would feel *less* gravity as its motion decreased the combined speed. As your inner-ear controls your sense of \"up\" and \"down\" the effect is something that needs to be considered. Higher tangential velocity reduces this effect, meaning for comfort you would want a high RPM or a large radius/diameter.\n\nHigher spin rates create bigger problems with Coriolis effects, however, so in general, larger centrifuges are better. If you want to properly simulate 1G while keeping to a rotation of under 2RPM to reduce Coriolis effects below what people would generally have problems with, then you're looking at a diameter of around 450m, 4 times the length of the ISS.\n\nIf you don't need a full 1g, or are willing to accept more disorientation, then you can build it smaller or spin it slower. Which direction you face can also greatly reduce these effects, so if its just being used as a sleeping compartment to reduce the harmful effects of microgravity or for growing plants, then it can be *much* smaller. That 450m figure is really just what you'd want for comfortable earth-like habitation in space.\n\nThis doesn't need to be a continuous ring, either. You could tether two objects together with cables at that distance and spin them against each other just fine. Indeed, if you've been following along with SpaceX's BFR announcements, tethering two such spacecraft together and spinning them could produce a comfortable gravity for the passengers during a trip to mars. I'm sure someone at SpaceX is looking into it, and I'd expect them to give it a try eventually.\n\nIn the meanwhile, if you've read this far you should check out Isaac Arthur's [video on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86JAU3w9mB8).",

This is a surface area problem, as those things like hovering around the surface. \n\nIt may be possible to create some kind of ecosystem to sustain photoplanktim growth with bio waste from the astronauts, but this would probably require lining the entire hull with a water layer to have enough surface area.",

Apparently pumpkins are among the most efficient plants in terms of converting CO2 into oxygen. Whether or not such a space station was viable is debatable. \n\nThe primary source is [behind a paywall](http://content.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,852344,00.html), but I wrote at length about the concept [here](https://www.damninteresting.com/the-third-reichs-diabolical-orbiting-superweapon/).

            "comment": "The Biosphere 2 experiment was created to postulate this question.  What came to light was that Oxygen gets absorbed by everything(Soil, metals, clothing, water, other biomass) and was not sustainable even by the most oxygen generating plants.  Even worse, there wasn't enough biomass available to feed the plants the CO2 it needed to create enough oxygen.  Adding more biomass would have just used up more oxygen.  Ultimately, it was seen as impossible to create an environment organically without human intervention(pumps, filters, computer regulators).  \n\nIf you could create the perfect system for 1 person, it would need 7-9 full grown trees just for the oxygen, or your typical backyard swimming pool sized algae farm.\n\nhttps://space.stackexchange.com/questions/2218/oxygen-self-supply-by-plants\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yAcD3wuY2Q\n\n",

Basically you would need a proper balance of energy (sun) with a practical balance of different life forms and nutrients and everything in a mini Earth. On the ISS significant modifications would be required to allow it to be 100% self sustainable and not required people to replace solar panels or light bulbs or whatever other artificial systems are in place (heat being a big one).",

            "comment": "Others have detailed the feasibility/reliability of this process, but a major issue (at least in long term applications) is the lack of nitrogen produced. Most of the air we breathe is nitrogen, without the correct proportions the over represented oxygen becomes a fire hazard. Humans don't do well with too much of anything, oxygen included. A simple solution is to bring nitrogen (I imagine it can be synthesized in some way or another, not too sure about that side of things) but then you can't really say you have \"unlimited\" breathable air. Obviously producing oxygen is better than bringing it with you, but there are still major downsides to consider. ",

            "comment": "Well I\u2019m not exactly qualified in environmental control, biology or deep space exploration theory. But having a rudimentary understanding of energy, chemistry, and biology; absolutely plants would provide oxygen. However. Plants need to consume (outside various minerals) Carbon and nitrogen. Well soil won\u2019t have an infinite supply of nitrogen. Okay what about hydroponics? Sadly no. Even nitrogen in water can be exhausted. So the first problem comes from limited nitrogen. Secondly, so plants are supplying you with oxygen. They don\u2019t live forever, when plants die they will return a portion of their energy and nutrients back into the soil. However. It is impossible to have a perfect transfer of energy. Between being in the soil, absorbed by the plant, constructed into the mass of said plants, finally being broken back down into the soil. They over all density and quantity of essential nutrients would decrease over time. Plants also have the habit of producing, methane along with oxygen. Specifically when they decompose. Obviously this best demonstrates the loss of matter. Humans can\u2019t breathe methane. (Not in abnormal quantities).  It\u2019s an interesting though experiment. With research and conjunction with people who\u2019s job this actually would be interesting. \n\nWhat about plants growing in zero gravity? There\u2019s an easy solution in my mind. Centripetal Force. At a rate that simulates the rate of gravity on earth. But how to power such a system? Carbon fuels wouldn\u2019t do the job for long. Solar? Potentially. But very costly and not yet ultra efficient. Nuclear? Maybe. Could a nuclear reactor even be created in space? It\u2019d be a daunting, impressive challenge to overcome. Considering the limitations of modern reactor design. Limiting it to the dependency of water. ",

Scientists already tried this with the Biosphere 2 experiment in Arizona and while it started off well, it failed rapidly. By the end, plants began to die, and based on what little I know from reading about the project, it's theorized that it was due to a lack of biodiversity of microorganisms, insects, algae, funguses, and other small life forms. All of these factors are detrimental to the long term survival of an enclosed system, and it would require lots of work to maintain....Work that wouldn't necessarily *guarantee* long term success of a system like this. \n\nEconomically speaking, it is much more efficient to use a rebreather or chemical oxygen system. Oxygen is the same regardless of how it was made as far as our bodies are concerned, ",

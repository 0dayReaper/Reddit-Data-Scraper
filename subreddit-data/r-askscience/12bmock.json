As a matter of fact, we have been working on CCR5 antagonists for a number of years (see Maraviroc, Aplaviroc, Vicriviroc, Leronlimab, etc). \n\nJust know the role of ccr5 is not limited to HIV receptor entry, as it participates in a number of GPCR signaling pathways related to granulocyte proliferation and differentiation, as well as a healthy pro inflammatory process in general terms. If you simply remove it completely the systemic effects may be without value to those with or without HIV.",

It is expressed in monocytes and NK cells, and even shows a role in neurodegeneration with alzhimers haplotypes. Ccr5 is different in that its expression is more broad (i.e. spleen, thymus, intestine, myeloid and leukocytes, etc.). Often times even in a family (i.e. CCR), the isoforms have very specific and sometimes unaffiliated roles in the body.\n\nAs for a ccr2 mutation, variations in CCR2 are associated with relative resistance to immunodeficiency virus type 1, which is a good thing. However other polymorphisms and genetic changes with ccr2 have been affiliated with cancer incidence and impacts on the MHC1 in regard to diabetes mellitus type 1.\n\nSo you can see, nothing is ever as straight as \"let's target this mutation and save cancer patients\", because in 20 years we find out all these other systemic changes this causes to a much more complicated biological system like that of immune regulators.",

Eliminating CCR5 would seriously disrupt tissue immunology and affect immunity against many more diseases.\n\nThis is the main issue with new therapeutics against difficult diseases like Cancer and HIV. It has to be incredibly accurate, such as CAR T, without creating it's own impaired immune system.",

Just because something is known to be a main coreceptor for this process does not mean it would remain exclusive if ccr5 is removed or that there are other chemokine receptors that assist. That is a big family of proteins (i.e. CXCR and CCR).",

For one, unless done at the embryonic level, CCR5 is already expressed on many cells, so you need to get rid of those cells (for example, irradiation, which carries risks) and engineer cells that don\u2019t have ccr5 to replace them.",

            "comment": "Yes, targeting the CCR5 receptor to inactivate or destroy it has been shown to provide protection against HIV infection. The CCR5 receptor is one of the co-receptors that HIV uses to gain entry into CD4+ T cells, which are a type of immune cell. Individuals who lack functional CCR5 receptors due to genetic mutations are highly resistant to HIV infection. Therefore, drugs that target CCR5 have been developed to block HIV entry into CD4+ T cells and have been shown to be effective in preventing and treating HIV infection.\n\nOne such drug is Maraviroc, which is a CCR5 antagonist that inhibits HIV entry into CD4+ T cells by binding to the CCR5 receptor and blocking the interaction between the receptor and the virus. Another approach is gene therapy, which involves using CRISPR/Cas9 to edit the genes of CD4+ T cells to disable the CCR5 receptor. This approach has shown promise in clinical trials and could potentially provide a cure for HIV.",

HIV has been successfully eliminated in several human patients who required bone marrow transplants for other reasons and for whom a donor with a natural homozygous deletion of CCR5 could be found. This mutation occurs relatively often in people with Finnish or Northern European heritage, and the patients have been shown to have zero viral load even several years after transplant, being effectively \u201ccured\u201d of HIV. The people with the CCR5 deletion mutation tend to be relatively normal in their immune function, but are naturally resistant to most types of HIV-1, which is the most common form of HIV outside of Africa, though another form of HIV, HIV-2 does exist and uses a different receptor for cellular entry, so they are not technically immune to all HIV.",

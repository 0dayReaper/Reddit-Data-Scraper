            "comment": "Dont know about spiders but there seems to be a hard coded fear respons to snakes in primates and humans. It works like this. The brain recieves an image and starts processing it  BEFORE you become concious of what you see!. The image first passes through a few 'departments' of neurons. Those first departments decide things like 'shape round or strait?', is it symmetrical? Where in space and moving where? What is it? Finally it enters your consiousnes with lots of stuff decided/labeled. BUT. When a snakeshape is seen by those departments, they fire immediately to the amygdala (regulates fear and disgust), prompting an immediate respons. The fear of snakes looks to go very far back in our evolution.\n\nSo this snake thing is a good example of the slow and fast thinking pathways in our brains.\n\nIt would be nice if science would do the same research on spider fear that they did on snake fear. My hypothesis would be that not the shape of a spider is the trigger. But the fast jerky movements spiders can make inside your personal 3 foot safe zone bubble.",

Lived on the east coast all my life and I don't think I've ever seen one thank god lol. \n\nEveryone I know loooooves their house huntsmen and tends to have the general attitude towards spiders of \"leave em alone, they're doing important work keeping other bugs away. Just shake out your boots and don't put your fingers where you can't see them\". But again, that's adults not 4 year olds in Aus learning about spiders from a British cartoon.",

When you have any initial disdain upon first sight, that is completely natural, and I think indicative to basic human nature but it\u2019s the excess amount of fear where it becomes mostly irrational and or  to the situation that it becomes more of a phobia. Like, for example, if I take a one two story elevator and I begin panicking at the height, that might be a little bit irrational because it\u2019s not necessarily that high up. However, when I start taking an elevator to the top of the Empire State Building, and the lookout upon the city it\u2019s pretty reasonable to feel very nervous. Same way if I see a little spider I\u2019m going to jump a little bit for a second but feel better. It\u2019s not the same as suddenly having a tarantula on you",

Telling kids that every spider is cool is doing them a disservice.\n\nAnd the Funnel Web is...pretty common...",

But having some fear of spiders is normal, and partially instinctive as others have said. Phobia in the psychological sense isn't merely being afraid, but an extreme level of fear, often leading to avoidance behaviours which can be more damaging in a person's life than actually seeing the thing they have the phobia of.",

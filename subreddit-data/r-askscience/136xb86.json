    "postText": "So, I know that inside the chamber of the engine, fuel is mixed with air and thus combusted to create an explosion. \n\nPreviously, this was my understanding:\n\nSince the explosion expands equally in all directions, it provides force equally in all directions. The \"back\" of the engine passes through the opening at the back of the nacelle, providing no  force.\n\nThe \"front\" of the engine pushes against the inside of the nacelle, pushing it forward. \n\nHowever, recently I have read that its actually the gas *exciting* the nacelle which provides the thrust. How does that work?\n\nEdit: Everyone keeps describing the rest of the turbojet, and I appreciate it but I have a (decent) understanding of the rest of the system. It's specifically how air escaping out the back moves the jet forward without pushing on it that's throwing me",

            "comment": "That's a great couple of questions. First, though, I need to clear something up: there is no \"explosion\" in the burner can of a jet engine. \n\nThink of a jet as a tube shaped a little like an hourglass turned on its side, but open at both ends. In the front of the engine is a set of fans, called compressors, that push intake air down into the narrowing tube (toward the middle of the hourglass). As this air moves toward the narrow middle of the engine, it is forced into a smaller and smaller space. This does several things: increases its pressure, velocity, and its temperature. \n\nWhen it reaches the narrow midsection of the engine, fuel (kerosene, usually) is sprayed into the moving air. If the engine is just starting up, a type of spark plug is used to ignite the fuel mixture. (If the engine is already running, there is fire in the burner can, so the igniter plugs are not needed.)\n\nAs the fuel mixture burns, its temperature increases. As it does, it expands. It is now moving through an ever-widening tube, and the expansion keeps it moving (even helping push it along faster). \n\nAt the end of the tube is a turbine that looks very much like a fan. Instead of pushing the air, though, the turbine is pushed BY the air (exhaust gasses). \n\nThe turbine is connected by a shaft to the compressor fan in the front, and it keeps the compressor spinning, so the combustion process is continuous. \n\nThat's how the burning process works. To answer your question about \"What provides the thrust?\", it depends on the engine. In a pure turbojet, the thrust comes from the pressure of the exhaust gasses as they leave the burner can and, later, the engine. \n\nIn a turbofan (which is what you asked about), the compressor blades are MUCH larger than the burner can, and push far more air into the engine housing than is needed for combustion. The extra air is simply directed (or \"bypassed\") around the burner can, blending with the exhaust on the way out the back. BUT this \"bypass air\" is being pushed by the compressor fan, just like what the propeller on a prop plane does, so it provides substantial thrust, too. \n\nYou can tell by looking at jet engines what kind they are. Pure turbojets are very narrow, kind of like a big metal cigar. Early turbofans are larger, the clue being that the fan in the front of the housing is much larger than the exhaust tube in the back. \n\nThere are also so-called high-bypass turbofans, like on newer Boeing and Airbus planes that direct 75-80% of their intake air around the burner. Propellers are very efficient at moving aircraft, so these high-bypass engines produce most of their thrust from the bypass air, and are much more efficient than pure turbojets.\n\nI hope this helps! Cheers!",

I had it in my head that the sigificant bypass element of a turbo fan had something to do with smoother airflow post combustion increasing the overall efficiency of the engine. \n\nThat's honestly fascinating that the fans are actually providing significant thrust vs just compressing air for the combustion chamber. \n\nThanks again!",

                            "comment": "Actually the smoother airflow with turbofans is part of their increase efficiency as you stated. From Wikipedia  \u201cIn a turbojet energy is wasted as the propelling jet is going much faster rearwards than the aircraft is going forwards, leaving a very fast wake. This wake contains kinetic energy that reflects the fuel used to produce it, rather than the fuel used to move the aircraft forwards. A turbofan harvests that wasted velocity and uses it to power a ducted fan that blows air in bypass channels around the rest of the turbine. This reduces the speed of the propelling jet while pushing more air, and thus more mass.\u201d\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbofan",

(The turbines can do like 10k rpm easy)",

In the analogy of the hourglass on its side, the expansion is happening in the rear half of the hourglass, and pushing on all the internal surfaces of that half (except the back, where it can escape). Most of those internal surfaces are curved or angled so that pushing on them has at least some thrust component pushing the hourglass-half forward.\n\nOn top of that, the expansion is being used via the turbofan shaft to drive the forward fan, which is sucking air into the front of the hourglass at high speed. That's additional effective thrust-via-suck, in the same way that helicopters/multicopters and ducted flight fans work.",

The answer is twofold:\n\n1. The shape of the walls push air toward the back. In any [turbofan](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ep3sN.jpg) the angle will be widening towards the back where the combustion is occurring, so even with wrenches (molecules) combusting in all directions, they will bounce toward the back based on the shape of the walls.\n\n2. The high-pressure air in front of the combustion chamber also acts as a wall, but on startup and at low speed the system is legitimately not as efficient. All engines have an ideal cruising speed for maximum fuel efficiency. When a plane is moving slow and still needs to generate a ton of lift (takeoff) the engines are quite inefficient. At cruising speed the natural air intake will do a lot of the work creating that high pressure system in front of the combustion chamber.",

Are you wondering why the combustion doesn't push forward back into the compressor blades as equally as it pushes backwards during combustion? \n\nBecause if so, the cause of this is that after combustion, the space for the new expanding gasses to move forward towards the compresser blades is very very small, but the exhaust gas moving backwards is passing into an ever-widening volume which drives it backwards incredibly forcefully at ever-increasing speed, more than enough to overcome the expansion force of the air-fuel combustion at the front of the combustion chamber. So due to the shape and volume of the exhaust portion of the engine, the \"sucking\" power of that force (for lack of a better term but just to illustrate my point in pressure differences) pushing backwards after combustion is wildly more forceful than the small amount of resistance the combustion itself is sending forward towards the compressor blades. Add to that the fact that the downstream fans are gaining force from the combustion which helps drive the upstream fans even harder, even further overcoming the combustion at the front of the combustion chamber.\n\nWith the force pushing harder backwards than forward because of the volume, think of how an impeller drives a fluid. When a certain volume of fluid is moving at a certain speed and the volume through which it is passing expands, the pressure decreases *as the speed increases*. So that's why the geometry of the combustion and exhaust chambers are able to overcome that force you are thinking should be pushing against the incoming compressed air just as equally.",

When they turn, they create some of the compression that pushes the intake blades on the backside. Additional compression is caused by the burning of the fuel. Obviously, the pressure cannot escape out the front of the engine, so it is all forced out the back of the engine. There are other parts of the engine that contribute to the forward thrust, but a large portion of thrust is pushing forward on the back of the intake blades.\n\nAt least, this is my understanding from the diagrams I've look at seem to indicate that being able to create more compression in the engine means the the intake blades can maximise the mechanical force of spinning to translate to forward motion. This is in contrast with standard prop planes that can only create thrust using the high-pressure solely created by the blades. I'm sure someone else can chime in on other ways the turbine engine produces more thrust, but I wanted to provide some insight into where some of the force is coming from.",

As already pointed out newtons 3rd law means that the aircraft experiences and equal but opposite reaction driving it forward with a different velocity but the same magnitude of momentum. \n\nSo if the air has a mass of m1 and a velocity of v1 and the aircraft has a mass of m2 and a velocity of v2 then m1v1=m2v2.",

The compressor stage is designed so that the air basically can't exit out the front. Basically, the expanding gasses are pushing on the new air coming into the engine, which in turn is pushing on the compressor blades. Take a closer look at compressor stages and you will notice that they are pretty complicated with multiple sets of blades oriented in specific ways.\n\nModern turbofan engines look VERY different from the jet engines that existed toward the end of WWII. They are quite literally giant fans with a jet engine at its core. The jet engine is there mostly to power the fans that generate most of the thrust. You can rely on just the combustion to provide thrust like you would with afterburners. But there's a reason why jets don't always have their afterburners on, it's incredibly inefficient and it chugs fuel.\n\nThe M1 Abrams basically has a jet engine in it. That jet engine is there to turn a bunch of turbines that in turn moves and powers the tank.",

The force of speeding up the air drives the fan forward, which in turn pushes on the aircraft to move forward. But also there are many other components to the force as in any airfoil; the reaction of the faster moving air joining a slower stream once leaving the duct, the slight pressure drop at the front of the fan, the pressure component on the back of the fan. Airfoils are friggin magic and they don't work on a single principle. You'd think it would be like a lever applied against a fluid but you'd be wrong because of the various components at motion involved.\n\nEdit: The burner cans themselves do not supply much momentum; that would be equivalent to the force of an open flame supplied with driven air. The force of expanding gas, which impinge on the turbine blades drive the turbofan, which participates in the above. The high bypass means the fast moving air gets to expand in an air stream and also participates in thrust after the turbine has extracted a lot of energy.",

                            "comment": "I used to do gas turbine maintenance (jet engine bolted to the ground and optimized very differently). It's literally just the pressure difference between the inlet and exhaust gasses. Imagine the inlet and exhaust are the same size. The face of the inlet has atmospheric pressure against it (roughly, there's some ram pressure that we can neglect for this purpose). The exhaust gasses might be at 2x atmospheric pressure. So if the exhaust is 2 feet in diameter then the engine would provide 6,300lbs of thrust (450sq in of surface area x 14 psi pressure difference from the inlet). \n\nIn power generation this would be very wasteful so they stick more rows of turbine blades back there instead and use that extra torque to turn a generator. Where a similar sized jet engine might have 2 stages a gas turbine would have 3 or 4.",

It ultimately is what pushes on the air to make it go out the back, the energy to do so being provided by the combustion in the engine. \n\nMuch like a propellor simply pushes air backwards, the compressor does a very similar thing, only pushing the air into a housing first before expelling it. It adds momentum to the air by pushing it backwards and pulls itself along at the same time.",

The air cannot go back.\n\nI think you're imagining a turbofan as a tube or a hollow cylinder while a better analogy for this specific question would be a rubber birthday balloon. However, the balloon is rigid and gases are compressed inside instead of inflating the structure and there's a special device instead that causes the air to increase pressure through combustion. The combustion process is not an explosion, but a controlled expansion of the gases inside the engine.\n\nA gas turbine (usually) needs an external engine to start and force the initial compression. Without it, the hot gases from the combustion chamber could potentially backfire inside the compression stages and damage it. Modern engine design have several failsafe against this.",

Therefore pressure drops at each stage. Don't think of the power turbines as 'plugs' or 'caps' in the gas path. Once past the last stage the exhaust is accelerated by the nozzle which has the effect of reducing any left over pressure to  ambient. \nThis rushing out an open end is what drives an inflated balloon forward: if the open end was highly restrictive the balloon wouldn't deflate and would just sit there.\nDon't worry about there being nothing to 'push against'.

Think of a hydropower dam - the water only wants to flow one way through the turbine due to the pressure differential. In this case the pressure is from the compressor, so it's more like having a pump upstream rather than a reservoir.\n\nIf the pressure differential is not high enough (for example, the compressor slows down, or not enough air is entering the inlet) then the combustion products will flow forward, this is called a surge.",

            "comment": "Those two explanations are essentially equivalent.\n\nFirst, you're getting some confusing answers because you mentioned a turbofan, where much of the energy is used to drive a giant fan (essentially a propeller inside a tube), but your real question is about how a pure jet works.\n\nBack to your question ... the \"extra force\" pushing on the front of the engine is equivalent to the force that accelerates combustion products out the back. You can increase thrust by increasing the mass flow-rate out the back while keeping exit velocity the same, or by increasing the velocity by keeping the mass rate the same, or any combination of these factors. Such changes mean it takes more force to push this stuff out the back, and hence more unbalanced force pushing on the front.\n\nFun fact: since the thrust is proportional to dM\\*V, but the energy needed is proportional to dM\\*V^2, increasing the exit velocity makes the energy needed grow faster than the resulting thrust. So the most energy-efficient way to increase thrust is by increasing the mass flow-rate, even if that makes the velocity drop a bit. That's why the most efficient modern jet engines are these giant turbofans like on A321-NEO and 737-MAX. They get to push out lots of air, not just combustion products.\n\nRockets follow the same equations, but have a different challenge. Since they start out carrying all the mass they'll ever push out the back, they're concerned with maximizing thrust per mass expended, so they try to maximize the exit velocity. This means they typically use much more energy for a given amount of thrust than a jet. And for things like electric ion thrusters, this goes to an extreme. They have minuscule thrust, but expend only tiny amounts of propellant to get it, and are limited by how much electrical power they can put to the thruster.",

When you inflate a balloon, you create pressure inside of the balloon - that pressure is evenly distributed all around the balloon, the outside air and the elasticity of the rubber push inwards.\n\nWhen you let the balloon lose, that doesn't change. The outside air and rubber still pushes inwards, from all sides equally front to back. Because of this, air is expelled out through the nozzle and the force of expelling that air by the pressure from everywhere in the balloon is what's causing the equal and opposite reaction, making the balloon fly forward.\n\nMaybe this helps?",

            "comment": "You've got a leading question in there, that the expanding gas could go forward or backward thus neutralizing the thrust, which is not true while the engine is running. At rest it's true.\n\nAt rest, burning fuel in the combustion chamber would send exhaust gas out the back and front of the engine, doing nothing.\n\nWhen running, which is kinda *given* in this scenario (and takes a lot of energy to get the engine in this state) the compressor stage on the front of the engine is exerting enormous force on the 'intake' side of the combustion chamber. The expanding gas of the combustion pushes equally in all directions, but it meets the high pressure air on the intake and is 'defeated' on balance...so it ends up going out the exhaust side. (Analogy: Your bike tire has pressure in it. Air pressure is pushing in all directions, but if you hook up a powered-on air compressor to the tube the pressure in the hose is higher and forces more air in the valve despite the back pressure in the tube). Behind the combustion chamber there is ostensibly a big hole, the exhaust. You have a combustion chamber being fed air and fuel which expands rapidly, and exits the only way it can, because the pressure out the exhaust is lower. In a turbojet, this escaping gas powers the turbine which in turn powers the compressor (allowing the feedback loop to happen)...and the escaping gas DOES have pressure and momentum, forcing the engine forward. In a turbofan, as much of the (power) thrust in the exhaust gas as possible is converted by the turbine to torque in the drive shaft, and that torque runs the turbofan and compressor. The more energy into the fan, the more efficient the thrust.",

            "comment": "As a mechanical engineer who works in aviation, the answer is simple and can be summed up in one word: momentum. \n\nThe air exiting the jet engine is going at a higher velocity than it was when it entered the engine. Since the engine has imparted momentum to the air particles, essentially flinging them backwards at great speeds, the engine must necessarily experience an equal and opposite reaction - which manifests as a net thrust propelling the engine forwards.\n\nThe description you provided in your original post is almost there, but isn't focusing on the right thing. You're just thinking of pressure (i.e. a tube open at both ends, with an explosion in the middle). Instead you should be thinking of velocity. The big fan in the front works like a propeller, literally pushing air backwards to generate forward thrust. You no doubt have no trouble understanding that. \n\nAs for the core, it starts with the compressor section which compresses the air, increasing its pressure (in other words, it pushes the air molecules closer together). The combustion section follows, it adds fuel and burns it, increasing the temperature of the air. Since the air is allowed to freely expand backwards, its pressure remains approximately constant in the combustor but its velocity greatly increases. Finally in the turbine section the hot, high-pressure, high-speed air is allowed to expand, losing temperature and pressure in the process. The air passes through turbine blades on the way, which extract some kinetic energy from the air to power the rest of the engine (fan, compressor and accessories). The very last stage is the exhaust nozzle, where the air expands all the way down to ambient pressure, gaining even more velocity in the process and imparting more thrust. Then it's out of the engine.\n\nThat's the high-level overview in a nutshell. If you want a more complex explanation of any particular aspect of it just ask.",

It's specifically how air escaping out the back moves the jet forward without pushing on it that's throwing me\n\nDunno if you\u2019ve got a satisfactory answer yet, but I\u2019d like to start by asking a different question: why is the air escaping out the back of the engine? It\u2019s because the engine *has* pushed it. Either because the air was compressed, heated, and expanded through turbines, or because it was blown out the back by the giant fan driven by those turbines. You can imagine that as the engine spins, it takes a slice of air and moves it backward, just like how you move yourself forward when swimming by moving water backwards with your hands and feet. \n\nTo take that stationary air and make it move requires a force, and Newton\u2019s third law says every action has an equal and opposite reaction, which means the force moving the air backwards also pushes forward on the fan blades. So why doesn\u2019t the fan fly out the front of the engine? Because the fan blades are connected to a shaft, which spins on bearings, which mount to the engine case, which is bolted to the wing. \n\nThat\u2019s how moving air out of a jet engine pushes the plane forward: the fan pushes on the air, which pushes on the fan, which connects to the engine, which connects to the wing.",

This core is basically a turbojet engine. Other components are added to the engine to make it a turbofan, turboprop or shaft. \n\nFor a turbojet, the turbine extracts energy only power the compressor. All the energy remaining in the exhaust is expanded in the nozzle to produce thrust. In essence, the pressurized air that is then combusted can be simplified into a balloon that releases air to generate that thrust\n\nFor a turbofan, the turbine extracts almost all the energy out of the combusted air to power the compressor and the fan. It turns out it is much more efficient to move a lot of air (relatively) slowly than a small amount of air very fast. So by adding the fan, you can have the same core, but it is much more efficient.",

            "comment": "Selecting a turbofan for this question has, I believe, hidden your real question behind all of the complexities of a turbofan.  Even a turbojet is simpler, but I would propose an even simpler engine:  a cold gas thruster.  This consists of a pressurized tank, a valve, and a nozzle.  They're mostly used in spacecraft and the smallest hobbyist rockets, the former because they're the smallest and lightest way to get just a bit of thrust and the latter because they're the only rocket engine you can trust a kindergartener to build (e.g. soda bottle and bike pump).\n\nIn this style of engine we can ask the same question:  what provides the thrust?  Looking at the gas exiting the nozzle it's no longer in contact with the engine, so we figure it shouldn't be the thrust source.  The gas inside the tank or nozzle would seem to be what has to push the engine forward since it's in contact.\n\nThat's a fair view of the engine and if we were to take the pressure of the gas on every surface and add it up (integrate it, remembering that it's a vector) then we'd arrive at a thrust value.  However, this is a really cumbersome way of working out the thrust value.  Just being physically sound doesn't make an approach practical to carry out.\n\nInstead what's typical to do is to look at the gas that has left the engine.  From here we can do a momentum balance, recognizing that any momentum imparted on that gas must have an equal and opposite impulse on the engine and whatever it's attached to.  This is much easier since we can just look at the speed of the exhaust and the the mass flow rate.  Increasing the exhaust speed and mass flow rate will increase the thrust of the engine because in order to do that you have to make the gas inside the engine push harder on the pressure vessel and nozzle.\n\nThis style of one-step-removed analysis is pretty common in physics and engineering, to the point where it's common to see statements like \"cold jet thrusters provide thrust by causing gas to exit the nozzle at high speed.\"  You can't have one without the other, so it's a fair statement, but if you really want to trace the forces involved it's the gas still in contact with the tank and nozzle that do the pushing.  The gas downstream of that point just has the effect of keeping the pressure up in the gas that's directly doing the pushing.\n\nYou run into a similar scenario when looking for explanations of how a wing generates lift.  One approach would be to look at the pressure on every surface of the wing and add those up.  There's higher pressure on the bottom, either due to the wing being angled up or cambered (but *not* due to any requirement for air passing over and under the wing to take the same time), so you could compute lift in this way.  Alternatively, you could look at the effect the wing has on the body of air after the wing has passed and compute how much air has been pushed down, reasoning that the wing must be pushed up the same amount.  These aren't competing explanations.  They're complementary.\n\nNote that with both this explanation and the previous one I've taken a simplified view of how a gas interacts with a surface, neglecting any shear forces; for more accurate results a more accurate fluid model is needed.  This further tilts the scale in favor of looking at the downstream gas properties instead of reasoning about surface interactions.",

Imagine holding a jetwasher. The force of the water exiting the nozzle provides an equal and opposite force that you can feel in your hand as a push in the opposite direction to that of the water jet. It\u2019s the same principle in the jet engine. All of the force is happening at the aperture, right at the point where the gases leave the engine. So essentially the gasses are pushing the engine from the rear. This isn\u2019t perfectly true, but hopefully good enough for intuition.\n\nNow, in the case of modern engines, most of the thrust actually comes from the great big fan at the front. Some of the air gets compressed and forced into the combustion chamber (hence turbo) but most of the air bypasses the engine and passes out the back. Here, the thrust is provided by the fan blades, not the expansion of hot gasses. So the force is happening just behind the fan blades. Air goes back, fan goes forward, taking the engine with it.

How does that work?\n\nGetting away from the question of turbofans: Thrust is, at its core, a question of shoving mass around. It is *not* about an explosion pushing forwards on the front of the combustion chamber while zero force pushes on the back of the chamber (the open hole). I mean it kind of is, but that's more a description of what's physically happening and not a description of the physics of it.\n\nThrust is not about explosions at all. It's about Newton's third law. If you were sitting motionless in space (zero gravity) with a barrel full of shoes, you could create thrust by grabbing shoes out of the barrel and throwing them in a particular direction. Thrust is calculated as how much mass you are moving multiplied by how fast you are moving it. So if you throw a 1 kg shoe every second, at a speed of 1 m/s, then you are creating 1 N of thrust. \n\nIt's because you are imparting 1 N of force on each shoe, thus each shoe is imparting 1 N of force onto you. Which is thrust. In the case of jets, it's just a matter of shoving mass out through a nozzle, and using combustion to help you do it. When you talk turbofans, then you're also using propellers to help you shove more mass through that nozzle.",

Why doesn't the exhaust (and thrust) go out the front of the engine\n\n2. How is the thrust actually moving the airplane?\n\nAs far as the internals of the engine goes, fuel is being injected into hot pressurized gas, where it causes that gas to heat up and expand even more. It wants to expand in every direction, but can't because it's blocked by the walls and fought against by the incoming air from the intake. Nature always choses the path of least resistance, so it goes out the back, pushing a fan that drives the compressor on its way out, so the cycle repeats.\n\nAs far as how it's providing thrust, keep in mind that although it's a lot less, the air has weight too. The engine is effectively throwing airplanes worth of air out the back at such a quantity and speed that it's able to push something as heavy as an airplane. You just need to get A LOT of that lightweight air moving really really fast.\n\nThat's actually the trick they use with a turbofan. You can have an old-school straight jet engine that pushes a little bit of air really really fast, or a turbofan that pushes a lot of air not quite as fast. The latter is more fuel efficient.",

First of all, there are two.\n\nThe majority of thrust in a turboFAN comes from the fan (i.e. bypass), not the core. This thrust is transferred to the fan blades themselves as they push the air (imagine kicking flippers through water, it\u2019s the same). The blades are connected to a hub, which is connected to a shaft, which is held in place by bearings. At least one set of bearings needs to be ball bearings, and these ones transfer the thrust load onto, typically, a second shaft, which carries the core turbomachinery. That shaft also has ball bearings, which are mounted, typically, onto a non-rotating structure in the engine which will probably also be directly connected to the engine mounts, which don\u2019t touch the nacelle, but go directly to the core structure of the aircraft wing. All these shafts, bearings structures &amp; mounts will be heavy components because they form part of this thrust load path, essentially lifting the entire plane.\n\nSome more thrust comes from the core, but that\u2019s really just the residual left over after enough power has been extracted to drive the fan. This thrust is transferred onto the compressor blades, which are connected to the aforementioned shafts &amp; bearings.\n\nYou\u2019ve mentioned the nacelle a few times and that is a comparatively lightweight structure that really just helps direct the gas flow &amp; alter its volume &amp; pressure.",

            "comment": "If you want to use the formula-based explanation,  you can use the equation for forces on a moving fluid in an enclosed volume. This is the approach in the book on aircraft engines by Farokhi. The easiest start is to only study a turbojet, not a turbofan.\n\nIf you take the engine with its pylon, and encapsulate it in a cylindrical volume, cutting the pylon, with the engine along the axis, and the exhaust at one end of the volume, you have created an enclosed volume of air.\n\nThe equation states that the (vector) sum of forces on the volume is equal to the product outgoing mass flow and outgoing velocity vector minus that product of the entering mass flow.\n\nThe acting forces are of course the thrust, which is absorbed via the pylon, but also the pressures acting on the walls of the volume. But since we're only interested in the result along the thrust axis, only the pressures at the front end, back end and exhaust are important.\nThe pressure at the front and back end (minus exhaust area) is the atmospheric pressure, and cancel each other.\nThere may be pressure left in the exhaust, so that may result in thrust.\n\nMass flows that exit the volume are the flow of exhaust gasses. These are mainly the intake gasses. Since they have been heated by combustion, and have been brought to pressure by the intake and compressor, they have high energy. They are not dense due to their high temperature,  but still contain a high temperature. This means that they can be expanded in the exhaust nozzle to high velocities. How exactly is based on the nozzle design and energy level. But the velocity is much higher than that of the aircraft. \nThere is also a little bit of extra exhaust mass flow added as fuel.\nThis means that the exhaust product of mass flow rate and velocity is very high.\n\nAt the entry face of the volume, there is gas going into the engine and around the engine. The latter is compensated at the exit face.  The former is a part of the mass flow rate into the engine. There may also be some air entering via the sides of the volume into the engine. But that also has the same axial velocity. These two combined are the engine mass flow rate, which enter the engine at the aircraft speed. \n\nCombining these partial results gives the thrust of the engine it is the sum of:\nThe sum of the  air mass flow rate and fuel mass flow rate , times the exhaust velocity. \nThe exhaust area of the engine times exhaust pressure\nMinus the air mass flow times the aircraft velocity. \n\nIf you add a turbofan or propeller, you add a second air stream with a second mass flow rate and (usually) different exhaust velocity and no fuel. The fan adds energy to its gas stream, which the fan exhaust nozzle turns into added velocity.\n\nIf you add an afterburner,  you add extra heat and mass to the exhaust gasses, allowing higher exhaust velocity and thrust. But only if the pressure in the gas stream is sufficiently high to achieve that velocity, and the exhaust nozzle has the right geometry. That is why fighter jets have varying exhaust nozzle geometries.\n\nHope my answer helps!\nI think Nasa also has some publicly available slides about this thrust formula.\nIf you want to read more in depth about engine design, I would advice the books by Farokhi, and Sforza.",

It's basically all there is to it. \n\nOnce the air leaves the engine, there's really no way for it to 'act' on the engine (not exactly true, but good enough for this), so all the force is delivered to the physical hardware of the engine--either the primary fan blades or the core nozzle--by pressure, and this is the thrust of the engine.",

            "comment": "It might help to look at how automotive turbo chargers work. It isn't about explosions, just heating and increasing volume of gasses that have been compressed. The intake blades push air into the combustion zone, where it burns fuel, the resulting additional gasses (steam and co2) are also hotter which increases volume even more. The larger volume of gas pushes past the blades on the exhaust side delivering more energy to the compression side. Put a bigger set of blades on the primary stage that can interact with with air without wasting as much energy in compressing it into the engine and you have a more efficient means of propulsion. Since this doesn't work so well at very high speeds or thin air, uses are limited",

The reason you want a higher temperature is that it will also increase the pressure. This creates a large pressure difference between the inside and ouside, which makes the air escape through the back (this works exactly like when you release an inflated ballon without tying it off). Additionally there is a turbine in the way of the escaping air which starts to rotate by the air preassure, this is also what drives the turbofan.",

The knocking sound is the result of multiple flame wavefronts colliding within the cylinder, resulting in explosions rather than a fire (which is pretty rough on crankshaft, connecting-rod, and wrist-pin bearings, too.)\n\nCheers!",

This is why in space if you throw a rock, you will move in the opposite direction of the rock with the same momentum, even though the rock did not \"push\" you. On the earth when you throw the rock you stay \"still\", but only because your muscles can exert expend energy to exert force against the ground to transfer that momentum into the earth and air.\n\nThe turbofan works on the same principle as throwing the rock, except it's countless numbers of gaseous molecules instead of rocks.",

            "comment": "At the end of the day, a jet engine works similarly to a propeller engine: a spinning fan blade pushes air backwards, which pushes the plane forwards.\n\nIn a propeller plane, the fan blade is spun by an internal combustion engine which works like a bigger version of a car engine: pistons and cylinders spinning a crankshaft attached to the propeller.\n\nIn a turbojet, the fan blade is at the front of a metal tube, and is spun by a small fan inside which is being spun by a jet of burning exhaust. The fan blade sucks air into the tube, some of it goes towards keeping the combustion going, and the rest just gets blown out the back of the tube.\n\nIn both cases, pushing air backwards pushes the plane forwards, as per Newton's second law of motion.\n\nBut a turbojet can spin that propeller fan much faster than an internal combustion engine can, because the internal combustion engine has a lot of parts that have to work together, but a turbojet is just a shaft with a big fan at the front end and a small fan in the back that catches a stream of air.\n\nThink of how fast you can spin a fidget spinner by hand, vs how fast you can spin it with a can of compressed air. Same kind of idea.\n\nAlso, the rear end of the turbojet is narrower than the front intake end, which compresses the air and increases its force even further.\n\nWhich is why a turbojet engine can provide much more thrust than a propeller engine.",

            "comment": "So i think may what you are missing is the fact that the force of anything is the sum (or integral) of the pressures on all surfaces of that. This means that when a fan or compressor blade increases pressure there is a pressure difference between the front and the back. This inherently means generating thrust. \n\nThe combustion itself does not provide any thrust, in fact usually there is a slight drop of pressure over the combustor but it increases temperature allowing the turbines to extract more energy than the compressors put in and therefore also drive the fan.\n\nThe reason we have the fan is that the force is related to the momentum imparted on the flow (mass*velocity) but the energy is related to the velocity squared (1/2*mass*velocity^2) so speeding up a large amount of mass a small amount is more effecient than speeding up a small mass a large amount.",

            "comment": "Basically, the fundamental equation for thrust can be simplified down to: Thrust = Mass flow rate * difference between inlet and outlet velocity.\n\nSo, to generate thrust, you need to pump airflow through an engine and have a difference between the inlet and outlet speeds. \n\nA turbofan essentially has 2 regions for airflow, the main engine core, where the combustion happens, and the bypass region. This bypass region has no combustion occuring within it.\n\nIn the core, the combustion and the energy it generates turns a series of turbine blades, which are connected to compressor blades and/or the inlet fan blades too (the big blades you see on engines when looking at them). Turning the inlet fans speeds up the airflow that flows through it, which includes both the bypass flow and the flow through the core.\n\nTherefore, a large part of a turbofans' thrust comes from the bypass, where a large amount of flow rate is accelerated by a slight amount, as opposed to the core, where minimal flow rate of air is accelerated substantially. So both the bypass and core produce thrust, but each do it by maximising 1 part of the thrust equation, while minimising the other term.\n\nHopefully this explanation is somewhat useful",

            "comment": "&gt; Since the explosion expands equally in all directions, it provides force equally in all directions. The \"back\" of the engine passes through the opening at the back of the nacelle, providing no force.\n\nInstead of thinking of this as 'force' think of it as high pressure gas first. You have your explosion that creates this (hot) gas. This high pressure gas is formed in the middle of a tube of spinning fans pretty much resulting in a massive internal on-way-valve as far as any actual overall flow is concerned. So the only direction the high pressure gas can expand to is with the direction of this one-way-system. On its way out the expanding gas moves and pushes against some fans (large diameter, easy to rotate for moving gas) that are connected to the fans in front of the combustion chamber (smal diameter, more difficult to rotate for moving gas) so its self supporting in maintaining this on-direction-flow. This on its own will create thrust, after all the amount of gas and its speed coming out the back greatly beat whats going in at the front resulting in a net positive thrust. And not only that, with a big and good enough explosion you will have power left over after this whole sustainability one-way-flow thing, so you can hook an even larger fan to the front that has nothing to do any of the combustion stuff but just pushes some other air around to give you even more overall thrust.",

    "postText": "While I am aware that some studies have suggested a potential link between mRNA vaccines and an increased risk of cardiac side effects like myocarditis, I am curious to find out how traditional vaccines, such as inactivated vaccines like CoronaVac, and Sinopharm, compare in terms of their association with heart disease. Are there any studies or research that shed light on this topic?",

            "comment": "According to some studies and reports, myocarditis and pericarditis have been more frequently observed after mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) than after inactivated vaccines (CoronaVac or Sinopharm). \n\nMost cases have occurred in adolescent and young adult males within a week after the second dose of mRNA vaccine. \n\nMost patients have recovered well with medicine and rest.\n\nHowever, there is not enough evidence to compare the risk of heart disease between different types of COVID-19 vaccines. \n\nMore research is needed to understand the causes, mechanisms, and long-term effects of these rare complications. \n\nThe benefits of COVID-19 vaccination still outweigh the potential risks for most people.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/myocarditis.html\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34921468/",

[Here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SgmFa0r04) is an excellent map showing accurately modeled atmospheric levels of CO2 from satellite and ground measurements taken during a year, for example.  You can easily see humans emitting it, and then forested regions sucking it up.  Unless it\u2019s winter in that hemisphere, in which case it just swirls around until spring.  Other gas levels show similar seasonal patterns.\n\n(Edit: changed to specify that it is a model based on continuous samples.  They obviously can\u2019t sample the entire atmosphere at once every day.  And CO2 isn\u2019t bright red.  Among other points people apparently felt necessary to clarify.)\n\n(Edit again:  wow, I was not really expecting so much karma and a double-gold for this.  The question just reminded me of this cool map I once saw.  I bet it's even a repost!)",

Although some types of oceanic carbon usage return the carbon to the atmosphere at a closer rate to that of plants, a significant portion becomes \"locked in\" long-term via decaying matter, ending up deep at the ocean floor. It could take decades or even millenia for such carbon to return to the atmosphere.",

Dissolved carbon dioxide in the water (as carbonate ions) is absolutely involved in ocean acidification, but carbonate in the ocean is also the primary source of carbon for the entire marine food web (just like carbon dioxide in the terrestrial food web). Phytoplankton use carbonate to make sugars and zooplankton eat them etc. Just like rotting trees in a forest, dead animals in the ocean often leave behind carbon that lasts for a long time. The mean age of particulate organic matter in the ocean is &gt;1000 years. This is why the ocean is called a carbon sink, there is a lot of carbon in the ocean that is not getting turned over and released back into the atmosphere. Like with any sink, there is a point when it gets too full and bad things (like acidification) start to happen. ",

OP talked about how it looks surprising but when you look at the scale it's really not that big a change. That being said it can be very easy to mislead people with data by adjustor the scales so I don't think it's wrong in this case to suggest caution when dealing with scientific data. If you're reading it make sure to pay attention to the scale used to determine if the changes are properly representative of the data being discussed. If you're the one publishing the data make sure your scale is large enough to represent all the changes in your observations and experimentation, but don't make it too big or too small so as to indicate a lesser or larger change than what is actually observed, remember most people aren't going to pay attention to the scale so your data may easily be misunderstood.",

Science tells us that this, along with other emissions from humans, are contributing in some way towards 'global warming'. However, upon examination of the soil, you can fairly judge both the average temperature and the oxygen content during that time period. There's periods of time in the history of the earth where 10C changes in average temperature happen within a year or two. Most of these can be contributed towards cataclysmic events, or the 'natural cycle' of temperature change due to changes in plant/animal distribution, or more or less the circle of life. \n\nThis current trend is on pace with cataclysmic events of past, only we are the sole reason for these events to be happening.\n\nWe are affecting the modern climate on our own in a drastic manner that, as far as we know, has only been matched by adteroidal impacts in the past, in similar time periods that single impact events have made happen. \n\nGlobal warming by humans is a thing, and if we don't change what we are doing, we are doomed to a very new, very different earth than has been seen before.

My fault.\n\nSo because the climate changes naturally, there can't be an additional effect due to human emissions? That's the dichotomy you're implying, and it's entirely wrong. Yes, the climate has been changing constantly. Yes, humans are also making it change a lot more and a lot faster than that. It's not either-or. And I also vehemently disagree that that graph shows that we are not producing a \"striking departure from historical cycles\". Look at that spike, it's so fast it might as well be vertical, and it's to higher values than anywhere else on that graph! If not like this, what else would a striking departure from historical cycles look like?\n\nYou know what happens with every time the climate shifts? Extinction events. Geographical changes like, dunno, ice ages. But hey, a mile of ice in Europe is totally fine when it happens naturally. Look at [this](http://www.deepeningwoods.net/tempChange.gif) image. All of human civilisation happened in a period of remarkably constant temperatures. We would like to keep the climate unchanged because changing it so suddenly means animals and plants are mis-adapted and our cities are suddenly in bad places.",

But if so,  yes there is a connection to mood and winter,  though as far as I've seen not because of CO2 levels but rather light levels.  Look into SAD, seasonal affective disorder, it's a type of depression due to not getting enough light during the winter months. Both because it is light out for shorter,  and because it's typically cold out so people stay inside more.  There are lights you can get to help counteract it. ",

This land would have to be roughly the size of Eurasia. For this reason when people started exploring the last  bits of explorable southern hemisphere they were expecting to quickly run into land, instead they nearly ran out of resources before finding Australia and New Zeeland. \n\nThis also caused them to discover New Zeeland when Abel Tasman and his crew were trying to explore the southern parts of Australia, because they thought it would be massive they explored way down south (against struggling with supplies) and completely missing it before hitting new Zeeland.

Remember that wind (in the northern hemisphere) is going primarily west to east, so you're going to expect the eastern side of emitting things to be greater than the western side.  When the wind is good, you can see specific emissions in California, but they're not too bright as they get swept away.  It looks like there's a bunch of emissions from the gulf coast (not particularly surprising), and by the time we make it across to the Easter Seaboard, it's pretty hard to even see anything due to how much is already there.  There's definitely a pretty big contribution as well though.\n\nE: [Here's what the emission profile looks like](https://youtu.be/eJpj8UUMTaI?t=62)",

But it would displace oxygen since metabolic processes convert oxygen and fuel into carbon dioxide and water. The exact ratio of O2 consumed to CO2 generated is called the respiratory quotient and can indicate the kind of fuel burned: fats, proteins or carbohydrates. Photosynthesis is one of the ways to convert it back. ",

Then dense, icier layers melt more slowly throughout the year, giving us more stable stream flows. It's actually a pretty big problem right now: heavy snow falls in the American Rockies have been shifting later in the year, meaning that they have less time to compress into dense layers that melt slowly. This means that a lot of the snow pack melts quickly in the spring, leaving less to full the rivers in mid to late summer. Just these last two weeks the Rockies got their first heavy snow of the season, and winter is almost over.",

Still, our water levels this year are lower than average. The falls of 2015 and 2016 were flood and/or hurricanes where the water went up to 10' (average maximum is 6') but our last two summers the swamps were hard cracked mud except for a few lakes which isn't good either (1.5-2' under the average minimum of 3'). It's like we're getting two extremes and little time in the middle, and it's as if our wet season (typically winter) has shifted back to fall instead so we're running on low by the end of spring instead of end of summer.\n\nNot to mention this January and the last I had alligators out...

            "comment": "Most posters have focused on carbon dioxide levels, but air quality does change seasonally as well.\n\nThe two most important pollutants that contribute to smog in the US are ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM).  Ozone concentrations are highest in the summer, as the production of ozone is faster when there is more sunlight and higher temperatures.  Trees contribute to ozone formation by emitting isoprene and terpenes; when those compounds are photo-oxidized in the atmosphere ozone can be created.\n\nSimilarly, particulate matter also has seasonal variability.  Oxidation of monoterpenes can contribute to a biogenic component of PM and is important in the southeastern US.   \n\nHowever, most of the seasonal variability in air quality is a result of changes in meteorological conditions (temperature, wind speed, humidity) and not based on changes in biogenic emissions from vegetation.  Human emissions are the root cause of most regional and urban-scale air quality issues, and our emissions tend to not vary much seasonally.",

            "comment": "Stick it in water until it cools down a bit.\n\nThen stick it inside a steel can.\n\nThen bury the can in a big hole and fill the hole with cement.\n\nThe idea behind doing this is to create a \"low Eh, high pH\" environment (when cement dissolves the solution is alkaline). The iron corrodes to form Fe3+ ions and, since iron is more reactive than the radioactive isotopes, such as plutonium, they remain as metals rather than becoming more mobile ions. Most metal hydroxides are also insoluble so the alkaline conditions help keep any ions that do form solid and less mobile.\n\nThe plan (and certainly the requirement in the UK, at least a few years ago) was that the radioactives had to stay put for a million years. Quite how anybody can guarantee the waste remains safely in a repository for way longer than any country on earth has existed isn't something anybody wants to talk about.",

            "comment": "Nuclear waste is a bit of a misnomer because in most places besides the US, what the US calls nuclear waste is what they call nuclear fuel. In countries where radioactive fuel is scarce (ex. France, Japan, etc.), the spent fuel is recycled and as a result, around 90-96% of the fuel can be recycled, vastly reducing both radioactive waste volume and also it's radiotoxicity. The reason why it's not always done is due to economics (cheaper to use new fuel).\n\nAs for the waste that can't be recycled, the waste is dried, mixed with glass-forming materials, melted, and then poured into a specialized container where it cools into glass. The container is then moved into a in a specialized storage facility.\n\nAt current levels, the US has enough spent nuclear fuel stored to power the USA entirely for the next 100 years.",

                            "comment": "It has been Japan's national policy to maximize the utility of nuclear fuel sources since 1956. In the past, Japan has relied on contracts with the UK or France to reprocess its fuel but it established Japan Nuclear Fuel Limited in 1992 to build nuclear fuel cycle infrastructure domestically. To my knowledge, Japan does not currently reprocess any nuclear fuel domestically as the Tokai plant shut down in 2007 and the Rokkasho plant has been set back through numerous delays. It does however operate several MOX reactors (4 currently, with 8 more planned by 2030) with the intention of converting a third of all their reactors to utilize MOX. You do not need to recycle domestically in order to recycle. Most of the west for example, recycled hard-to-recycle plastic waste by shipping it to China until China stropped importing waste in 2017. Recycling is recycling no matter where it's done and Japan most certainly recycled their spent nuclear fuel.\n\nhttps://world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/transport-of-nuclear-materials/japanese-waste-and-mox-shipments-from-europe.aspx\n\nAs for France, the amount of fuel to be recycled is going up and France is running out of storage space (expected to be reached by 2030). France is planning on building at least 6 more reactors by 2050 to help reprocess more fuel. EDF is currently building another refrigerated cooling pool at La Hague but it won't be ready until 2034 at earliest. There's also a currently unapproved plan to store high-level radioactive waste below ground in eastern France.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/environment/france-seeks-strategy-nuclear-waste-site-risks-saturation-point-2023-02-03/",

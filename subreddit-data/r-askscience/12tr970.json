These creatures are all animals because they are more closely related to other animals than to fungi or other species.\n\nIf you look up close at living coral, btw, you'll see that they look like [tons of mini-anemones](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/2018-01/image_1.jpg?itok=pEA5Pc1P)",

Carnivorous plants, like the Venus Fly Trap, actually get their energy from photosynthesis. The animals they eat are to supplement other nutritional needs that most plants get through their roots, because in the wild they evolved in areas with very poor soil with little of the minerals, etc, a plant needs to live. \n\nThere's actually five different kingdoms, plants and animals are just two of them. No need to try to shoehorn the others into those two.",

They close by rapidly expanding the cell wall on the outside to force a bend and then expanding it on the inside to open back up. Unlike water pressure movement like you see in legumes this system is not elegant or reusable which is why flytraps can only close three to four times each.",

This clade is a monophylum and has a pretty well defined set of apomorphies that differentiate them from other clades, the ones that set them apart from fungi is a multicellular organisation that lacks cell walls as a structural element and having gastrulation as a part of embryonic development.\n\nBut that doesn't even matter, we know Metazoa and Fungi aren't really related because we have sequence data to back this up.",

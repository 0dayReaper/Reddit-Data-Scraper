            "comment": "Adequate restful sleep reduces blood pressure by allowing the clearing of stress hormones such as cortisol from the body - blood pressure drops as much as 17% during sleep. Sleep deprivation causes elevated levels of cortisol, which continue to rise the longer one is denied sleep. Increased cortisol leads to increased blood pressure and systemic inflammation, and thus headaches.\n\nSleep is also responsible for clearing adenosine (a byproduct of energy consumption in the body, the adenosine in ATP) from the brain. Elevated levels of adenosine in the brain trigger sleepiness and increased pressure to sleep, which may be felt as headaches.",

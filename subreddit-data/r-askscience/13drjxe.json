    "postText": "Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology**\n\nDo you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: \"What would happen if...\", \"How will the future...\", \"If all the rules for 'X' were different...\", \"Why does my...\".\n\n**Asking Questions:**\n\nPlease post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.\n\n**Answering Questions:**\n\nPlease only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.\n\nIf you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).\n\nPast AskAnythingWednesday posts [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27meta%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).

Some unusual tests require reservation (e.g. abdominal ecography), and when you call (or reserve online) you receive the instructions of how to get ready for it.\n\nBut since blood glucose is a routine test that is checked nearly every time, in 99% of cases they tell me not to eat. They take the blood sample early in the morning for convenience: it's just a delayed breakfast, not any significant deviation from your daily routine. Right in front of the lab there's a caf\u00e9 with a long queue of people willing to have a coffee and brioches right after the blood sample was taken.",

While different areas might have some morphological differences, they're generally pretty adaptable. \n\nTo clarify what I mean, back in '98 or '99 there was an experiment done with a newborn cat where the optic nerve was disconnected from the optic nerve was disconnected from the visual cortex and to some degree (I'm certain it was only a small percentage of the neurons) connected to the audio cortex. The cat was able to \"see\" (probably with limited acuity and resolution) despite this drastic change in input. \n\nThis sort of thing suggests that the cortex is very adaptable. I would think that would lend itself well to being able to taking different kinds of inputs and with feedback, be able to perform useful calculations.\n\nAnyway, just curious if there's any substantial research in this area. I've always felt there's a great deal of potential in creating biological computers.",

And depending on which combination of keyholes you fit with their respective keys, different mechanical processes are put in motion. And differently shaped keys might fit different subsets of said keyholes, giving you a restricted set of action you could set in motion with a specifically shaped key.\n\nCells work similarly. They express a vast set of receptors (e.g. keyholes), that can be similar to each other or vastly different in shape. All of them trigger different pathways (e.g. machinations) inside the cell that lead to a specific set of cell responses when activated. In addition to the ability to turn on and off the expression of those receptors under certain conditions, different cell types will express vastly different subsets of receptors in general.\n\nNeurotransmitters (or other agonists, to be more general), just like the keys in the analogy, can fit a specific subset of receptors to bind and activate them, due to their chemical structure. \n\nThat means, what happens in response to an agonist being present is not only dependent on the agonist itself, but also on the availability of receptors on said cell, which in term is dependent on the cell's own biology and genetic make up and regulation.",

Although we can deduct the brain performs functions like memory, processing power, etc. we don't know whether this translates into brain parts that could be considered storage, CPU, a kernel, software etc. It's tempting to assume that there is \"software\", but we haven't found it yet, and it might just not work that way, but only look similar to computers on a surface level.\n\n\\-You  cannot \"localise\" a lot of functions in the brain. Although we did find some functions that are clearly localized to some brain area's - like the speech centers - once you go to higher order processes like semantics, reasoning, motivation, aka, all that is really interesting, you cannot pinpoint certain regions and synapses as being responsible for them. People have been trying to localise these for more than half a century, and we consistently run into some kind of barrier. It seems that for a lot of these higher order function a lot of distribution is going on, where activity is spread over larger parts of the brain.\n\n\\-There is strong evidence the brain works like what is known as a complex system in systems theory, where processes like emergence play a role. That is: complex processes emerging which cannot be explained by analysing it's constituent parts.  This is absolutely essential: complex phenomena seem to \"appear out of nowhere\" as the constituent parts don't suggest they can add up into complex processes. This is a rather big problem in science, as the latter is based on pulling things apart, understanding the parts, and then adding them all up together. This cannot be done with these complex systems, and we are only at the beginning of understanding how we could research such complex systems. But this would imply that it will be very hard to 'decode' the brain by understanding the function of individual neurons or brain regions, which is consistent with the observation in my previous point.\n\nIf you want to know more, I strongly suggest watching the \"Chaos\" and \"Emergence\"  lecture series of Robert Sapolsky on Youtube. Also, you could read up on complex systems and emergence",

Perhaps it does not simplify to a massive boolean algebra equation, and the brain also may not be a generalized Turing machine... but catching a ball requires computing a second order differential equation (as a very simplified model, taking in to account the angular momentum of each joint from the feet to the hand is incredibly complex) to match the accelerations of the arm and the ball so that their trajectories intersect at the right time. We do all sorts of these calculations all the time, and they seem to develop similar to how neural networks develop. We learn language by faking it until it is developed enough to not require feedback and guidance from the trainers. The same with walking, eating, riding a bike, etc.\n\nI will definitely check out those lectures, I am fascinated by emergent phenomena, especially in engineered systems.",

Protein, carbohydrates, sugars, etc.  Sometimes cooking actually makes those more available.\n\nMicro-nutrients are a mixed bag and we need to examine specific examples.\n\nMinerals are usually not affected by heat, however, they can dissolve in cooking water.  For instance, iodine is an important trace nutrient which you are mostly getting from seafood or salt that is fortified with iodine, but it is very soluble in water so you can easily wash it out, but you can also add a teaspoon of iodized salt to pasta water and you are now getting more iodine in your diet that you normally would.  Iron usually becomes more available after cooking because heat breaks down connective tissue and cells, making the iron more \"bioavailable\".\n\nVitamin C is easily destroyed by heat, even 5 minutes of cooking can remove all of that vitamin from a food.  However, almost every person alive eats enough variety of fresh and cooked food to be sufficient.  You actually have to work really hard to eliminate it from your diet.",

It depends, if the binary stars orbits are huge, the planets could exist around one or the other, and it would seem similar to our system now, the other star would be the second brightest thing in the sky, but it would probably just look like a really bright point. If the orbits are tighter, the only stable planet orbit would be well outside both orbiting stars.",

However, for example, the most common type is CMT1A which is caused by having three copies of a gene called PMP22. You need one copy of PMP22 to live, but having multiple copies makes too much of it and deforms neurons. Currently there are basically three types of gene therapies that are developed enough to be used in people; 1) gene editing that puts a new gene in the cells (for example in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the patients don't produce any functional dystrophin at all, so the gene therapy adds a gene for dystrophin which fixes the problem), 2) turns a defective gene off completely by destroying the genetic sequence, or 3) removes some cells from the body, makes specific \"rewrites\" to a gene, and then puts them back in (this is almost always the cells that make new blood cells, like in the sickle cell anemia trial). In the case of CMT, 1 doesn't work because the functional gene is already there, there is just too much of it, 2 doesn't work because if you get rid of all of the gene it is lethal, and 3 doesn't work because you can't remove all the neurons to engineer them. Huntington's disease is a similar case in that you have to get rid of a lot of the defective gene but not all of it, and there are human clinical trials using antisense oligonucleotides, but they have not been successful yet. This isn't to say that it is impossible for an effective gene therapy to be made eventually, just that it is beyond our abilities right now. There do seem to be good animal models of CMT developed in the last 10 years, which is a start.",

That kind of statement got replicated into a lot of other countries too.\n\nIn the US, Congress is blocking human trials of gene therapy because of something called \"three-parent baby\" or mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT).  Lawmakers have done this by including a rider in laws that fund the FDA each year.  These budget bills say that the FDA cannot use any of its funding to review an application to start clinical trials on \u201ca drug or biological product \u2026 in research in which a human embryo is intentionally created or modified to include a heritable genetic modification.\u201d\n\nThat leaves us with a lot of blood, cancer and eye targets, but very few hereditary genetic conditions being studied.",

Same idea with internal implants such as heart stents or artificial hips.\n\nIt is next to impossible to do this with things like catheters or any material that interfaces with the outside world.\n\nWe can get a few months from a permanent venus port because we coat the material in antibiotics, like a layer of paint.  The recipient then also has a huge amount of lifestyle restrictions, and usually they are in extreme care for things like stage 4 cancer.\n\nA problem is called biofilms.  You can make a surface sterile but bacteria have a trick.  They slam millions of their own dead bodies into the gap to for a new surface coating.  They build their house on the dead bodies of their ancestors.  Plaque that form on your teeth are one example of a biofilm.\n\nWe have no known materials that stop biofilms \"forever\".  Even very shiny hard plastics or metals eventually get fouled.  We can coat a material in preventative chemicals but they don't last long enough for contact with the outside world.\n\nOne method we have now is to make a scaffold that your tissue will grow into.  It's done with bones mostly, and somewhat with skin grafts.  But those are eventually completely buried and not interfacing with the outside world.\n\nA potential future method is to engineer *something* that excretes enzymes onto materials of the port.  Could be a \"living\" biomaterial or a really clever new material and catalyst that takes feedstock from your body to renew it's own protection.  Better than a fence covered in spikes, this is an electric fence that requires some input (e.g. electricity) to constantly renew the protection.",

The faster you want to alter the particle's path, the stronger the field has to be, so rather than sticking these fields directly on top of your buildings (which will also create all sorts of headaches in terms of using metal or electrical equipment) you would want to place it as far away as you can while still being an effective shield (which might also make it easier to shield a larger area). You also have to be wary of the possibility that the magnetic field might direct more radiation towards certain areas.\n\nIt is also worth noting that matter (be that regolith, water, or many other proposed shielding materials) can block all radiation, at short range, with no power requirement or the equipment headaches, so you would want to consider if the magnetic shield was a better option than just burying your living spaces.",

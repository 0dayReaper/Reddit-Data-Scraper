    "postText": "I understand that as vessels age, the endothelium becomes less responsive to various chemical signals, including nitric oxide.  What I don't understand is why this happens .... is it because of an increase in the number of senescent cells in the endothelium?  Have I got this wrong and it is a decrease in nitric oxide production?  Or is this some other change in the sensitivity of the endothelial cells to existing or even higher levels of nitric oxide available?\n\nThanks ... having trouble wrapping my head around this.",

            "comment": "Many many things. some include: Cellular senescence, atherosclerosis/calcifications (physical narrowing that won't improve with nitric oxide around), autonomic changes with age changing basal tone, shear stress (narrower vessels causing higher velocity flow which damages endothelium more easily), exposure to medications which might change vessel characteristics (eg chemotherapy wreaks havoc on blood vessels).",

They sound like consequences.  This is closer to what I mean by the cellular level pathophysiology.\n\nRe: scenescent cells ... I understand that there is some evidence from cellular reprogramming (Yamanaka factors, for example) that endothelial function can be partially restored.  NOT remotely a specialist in this area so I read as an experienced lay person.  Any comments on that research?\n\nRe: changes in autonomic basal tone ... I know very little about this at this point and would love some pointers to papers discussing it.\n\n\nThanks very much for responding :)",

                            "comment": "The simple answer is that we don't know. In general, the molecular basis of aging is quite poorly understood.\nWith regard to the endothelium specifically, many of the things you label as \"insults to the endothelium\" are pretty normal occurrences that trigger various intracellular signaling pathways. As we age, genetic instability increases (sort of) and the probability that a deleterious mutation occurs increases. These mutations, while maybe not enough to cause catastrophic effects, can change the signaling responses/balance in the cell. In endothelial cells, this sometimes can result in cytoskeletal dysfunction, resulting in changes to permeability, contactility, and migration. The vast majority of our understanding of the molecular basis for these changes comes from diseases. But its also pretty clear from the chronology of many vascular diseases that aging in many cases contributes to disease severity. It may be specific molecular changes that occur during aging, or it may be that with more time the damage builds to a critical point (once again for the most part we don't really know).",

But one cool fact is that humans are uniquely good at getting plaque in their arteries compared to every other mammal. Like autopsy of a teenager\u2019s aorta and you can see signs of it starting. Went to a research talk where a lab was using pythons to study how an animal that eats an animal whole can quadruple its cholesterol after a meal but not get atherosclerosis/plaque.",

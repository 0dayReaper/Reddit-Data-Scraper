Many elderly people have dense cataracts (which, if left long enough, would act pretty much the same as covering the eye). When these cataracts are removed, vision goes back to normal, assuming that no other diseases are present. ",

Historically they'd remove the lens entirely, and you'd have to have really massively strong glasses forever.\n\nSo the surgery is sorted, as far as I know the problem is making a lens that's just the right amount of squishy, in exactly the right way, and has the right optical properties.",

Apparently cataracts are much more common over there, and without proper attention many people just became effectively blind because the lens was so cloudy. So the doctor removed the cloudy lens and replaced it with a clear artificial one. After they took the bandages off of their eyes, finally able to see for the first time in years, almost every single patient began crying and thanking... Kim Jong Un. Not the doctor. There was a portrait of Kim on the wall and they would get on their knees and bow to it, praising him for allowing them to see again. ",

The lens does shift slightly with accommodation, forward, I think, and that will have some optical value. But it's hard to measure any focusing ability in most humans after fifty, and virtually impossible after 60.\n\n",

UV light, certain drugs can increase these processes.    \n\n\nAlpha-crystallins are the trash men/managers for the lens and overtime they lose function. Proteins become denatured and build up within the lens.    \n  \n  \nDepending on where in the lens they accumulate, you have the various types of cataracts. Nuclear, the  yellow colored one, happens within the center of the lens. Cortical with spokes coming in peripherally towards the central inner area. PSC (Posterior Subcapsular Cataract) occurs on the most posterior portion of the lens. PSCs are associated with steroid use often too.    \n  \n  \nDiabetes causes a specific type of cataract due to sorbitol within the lens. Also Diabetes can cause PSCs.    \n  \n  \nThere are Rosette/Traumatic cataracts that result from the forces on the lens/eye. Kids can be born with congenital cataracts, some are minor being harmless and other must be removed to avoid strabismus (lazy eye) and/or ambylopia (decrease vision due to strab).    \n  \n  \nSource: 3rd year Optometry student  ",

Numerous morphologic, biochemical, and biophysical changes occur to the lens with age. Most notable are the age-related changes in color (more yellow), light transmission (decreased), consistency (increased hardness), loss of accommodative ability (manifested clinically as presbyopia) and protein aggregation. The resultant lens opacification, referred to as cataract, results in loss of light transmission.\n\nThese lenticular changes are accelerated by a continuous entry of optical radiation into the lens, especially UV. People who live closer to the equator require cataract surgery earlier in life due to increased UV light exposure. ",

He meets a woman who pays for corrective surgery to get his sight back. It's successful but he's never had vision before so he...I guess you could say he doesn't know how to see. He *can* see but vision is completely new to him. Like if you could suddenly taste sounds but you can't recognize what any of the tastes are. He doesn't understand facial expressions, which makes sense. But....it's almost like he can't grasp the *concept* of seeing. \n\nI had a question when I first started typing but I forgot what it was so I'll ask this instead: do eyes atrophy? He's had eyes his entire life but he's never used them before. For the sake of argument, if a totally blind from birth person had surgery that gave them perfect vision, would their eyes be atrophied? Would they need to be \"exercised\" to full health?  For example, in The Matrix, after Neo gets unplugged, Neo says his eyes hurt and Morpheus responds with \"because you've never used them before.\"",

I'm not entirely sure if this would still be approved with today's standards, but various procedures fall under categories of \"no pain\" \"relieved pain\" and \"unrelieved pain\". Scientists need to report if the procedures they are using will lead to pain, and if it does will that pain be alleviated (analgesics or anesthesia) and if it is not relieved is there sufficient evidence that it is scientifically justifiable to do so anyways or will it only last a short period of time. That last part leaves a lot up to interpretation. It's understood that in many situations animal research leads to pain or discomfort, and if steps can be taken to remove or reduce that pain without compromising the design of the study, the researchers have to take those steps.",

            "comment": "TL;DR: No unless the brain is still developing.\n\nI just got my degree in Psychology and can answer this in terms of brain development.\nPermanent loss of vision has not been observed in adults, as u/Moorgan17 stated earlier. Permanent loss of vision has been seen however in young animals. A study was conducted years ago where one of a kitten's eyes was stitched up pretty much right from birth. I believe the eye was kept closed for about a year (at least a couple of months, but I'll double check that). When the eye was opened back up again, the kitten was permanently blind in that eye. I'll try find then start and link it. I'm on mobile right now.\n\nThis has to do with the Occam's razor effect that developing brains have. This behaviour transcends species and basically means \"If you're not using it, get rid of it\". It's a way of the brain not putting effort into something that doesn't work anymore. It's even been shown that the part of the brain associated with the loss of sight ends up working on some other part of the body (kind of like how blind people have slightly heightened other senses). This is known as brain plasticity.\n\nSide note: brain plasticity also works in the opposite way. A young girl had half of her brain removed in an attempt to relieve her of her constant seizures. This left the young girl paralyzed on one half of her body and with several cognitive difficulties too. Over time, however, the half of the brain that was left began to compensate for the lack of brain mass and she began to regain movement in the side of her body affected by the surgery, her language and other cognitive skills. \n\nBasically brains are cool. \n\nEdit: a video on Jody, the girl with half a brain https://youtu.be/VaDlLD97CLM\n\nEdit 2: for those interested in the kitten study, see Hubel, D. H. &amp; Wiesel, T. N. (1964). Effects of Monocular Deprivation in Kittens\n\nAs it turns out, the kittens' eyes were sutured for only a few weeks, not even months.",

The blind have been proven to develop some form of echo location with practice, and further study has shown that the visual cortex is partially activated during such exercises. So in not seeing for a year, your vision won\u2019t change when you go back to it, you may just build neural pathways to \u201csee\u201d sound in some capacity as well. ",

Many people whose vision becomes impaired, experience visual hallucinations. Didn't answer your question directly, but you already have plenty of answers and I thought this might be interesting to you, as it's kind of a related topic.\n\nEdit: The English title is, in fact, 'hallucinations'.\nThe German title is 'Drachen, Doppelg\u00e4nger und D\u00e4monen. \u00dcber Menschen mit Halluzinationen.'",

Kittens exposed to only horizontal lines couldn't see vertical lines and vice versa.  People that had their vision restored who lost it at a very early age had a great deal of difficulty understanding the signals that were coming into their brain.  You could explain to them what they were seeing, but they had no frame of reference with which to process the images, although [this article](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/10/feature-giving-blind-people-sight-illuminates-brain-s-secrets) seems to indicate that the ability to perceive can be gained in as little as a year and a half.",

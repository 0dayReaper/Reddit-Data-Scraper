    "postText": "Hi, I know that the question may seem confusing at first, but let me explain. I am 20 and have stuttered for as long as I remember. Quite recently, I noticed it has become a bit more severe.\n\nOne thing I noticed is that when I sing, the stutter goes away completely. So that got me thinking. Can you train your brain to use the part that it's using for singing for example, to use it for speaking, thus making the stutter go away completely. I'm sorry if this is a stupid question, and I know I might ask for the impossible. But still, I consider it an interesting thought.",

            "comment": "To answer your question: yes. The brain can adapt to use a different area. Patients with damage to the area that coordinates speech have been know regain the ability to speak and show different brain activity compared to a neurotypical brain. However, stuttering is a complex neurological disorder that has multiple factors. It could be word recall, physical coordination, anxiety, etc... when you sing, you're engaging other neurological parts that associate with music in addition to the speech areas.",

            "comment": "Seconding Midlofthian, your brain can adapt to many changes, and different regions can make up for defected ones (to an extent obviously)\n\nSpecifically regarding stuttering, then I've seen people who stutter - that can recite the same text if some one is reading it alongside them. Quite profound.\n\nThere's something about the audio feedback loop that gives structure/scaffold for the brain to build on (in my whacky words). There are even apps that utilize this, and can improve your stuttering:  \nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/fonate-daf/id981000993  \nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chinjja.app.daf&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1",

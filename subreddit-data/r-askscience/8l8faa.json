Here are two (I don't know of others) such examples of this:\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectively_extended_real_line\n\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere\n\nThe latter is the extension by defining z/0 in the complex plane.\n\nA lot of the math rules are the same as you're used to, but there are important differences. For example in the projectively extended reals statements such as\n\n* a &gt; b\n\n* a set of all numbers between -4 and 7 is [-4...-1...0...7]\n\nare no longer meaningful without extra context. I can always pass through infinity to just as easily write\n\n* a &lt; b\n\n* a set of all numbers between -4 and 7 is [-4...-10...infinity...7]\n\nWith some added assumptions of what \"a\" and \"b\" are and where infinity is on your interval if it's included, you can restore the idea of order and intervals.",

There, if you try to divide by zero, you end up with another object, which is labeled \u221e. But then as it turns out there are two other \u201cinfinities\u201d that show up if you play around with 0 and \u221e, which show a bunch of curious rules. Among other things it turns out that 0\\*\u221e \u2260 \u221e\\*0, which is kinda weird. Since that is true for all other numbers, you lose some important structure. There\u2019s also no natural way to order these new numbers, so 1&lt;\u221e isn\u2019t true or false but just senseless.",

The first few lessons are extremely accessible, then it gets a bit more complex as he goes on to prove all the claims he made actually hold, and then it gets more accessible again. The relevant lesson is [26. Keep Calm and Divide by Zero](https://graphicallinearalgebra.net/2015/12/14/26-keep-calm-and-divide-by-zero/), to understand it you\u2019ll definitely need to read the first bunch, maybe up to number 9, which are all pretty light and introduce the whole notation of GLA (after that the proofs start). You\u2019ll need to figure out some other things from the later lessons, too, but it should be pretty intuitive then, just don\u2019t let the fancy words scare you.",

So for example you could have the set of all n x n matrices which rotate vectors.\n\nOne of the rules of groups is that if you perform the group operation with two elements of the group, the result is another element of the group. So sticking to the rotation matrix example, if you multiply two rotation matrices you get another rotation matrix.\n\nSuppose you know that a and b are both in your group, and neither is the identity element. If the group operation is commutative, ab=ba=c is also in your group. If the group operation is not commutative, ab=c and ba=d are in your group. So just from this very simple contrived example we figured out a little bit about the group's structure.",

With that in mind:\n\n`1/0` is just another number that, as in the parent comment, connects the negative and positive numbers \u201cat the top\u201d as if the number line was a number circle with the zero \u201cat the bottom\u201d. Now, in everyday math, if you multiply any number by 0, you should get 0. That\u2019s a law (an axiom) that we impose on numbers\u00b9, but you\u2019ll get inconsistent results if you allow `0 * 1/0 = 0`, instead it must yield the new element `0/0`. But now we\u2019ve lost an important bit of structure (namely the expectation that 0*x = 0).\n\n---\n\n\u00b9 specifically it is an axiom of _Fields_, which are basically collections of numbers where arithmetic does exactly what you\u2019d expect it to. No division by 0 allowed in fields, however. _Wheels_, described above, are basically an extension of _Fields_ that allow for division by 0 but lose some other structure to compensate.",

Basically x is a fraction, its numerator is x1, its denominator is x2, and you'd want to write it as x = x1/x2, but let's not do that for now. \n\nIntegers are fractions with 1 as their denominator, so instead of writing the integer 2 as (2, 1), we'll just write 2. Just like we usually do with fractions.\n\nTake two elements x = (x1, x2) and y = (y1, y2) from this wheel. You can perform 3 operations on them:\n\n* **addition**: x + y = (x1, x2) + (y1, y2) = (x1\u00b7y2 + x2\u00b7y1, x2\u00b7y2), which is the usual way you'd add two fractions\n* **multiplication**: x\u00b7y = (x1, x2)\u00b7(y1, y2) = (x1\u00b7y1, x2\u00b7y2), which is the usual way to multiply two fractions.\n* \"**division**\": /x = /(x1, x2) = (x2, x1), basically the operation \"/\" reverses numerator and denominator as you'd expect\n\nThis division allows you to write en element from the wheel as a fraction: for example, take the element (1, 2). You want to write it 1/2.\n\n* 1/2 = 1\u00b7(/2) = (1, 1) \u00b7 /(2, 1) = (1, 1)\u00b7(1, 2) = (1, 2) per the multiplication rule.\n\nSo basically, writing 1/2 or (1, 2) is the same thing.\n\nNow just apply the addition rule to 1/0 and -1/0. You get:\n\n* 1/0 - 1/0 = (1, 0) + (-1, 0) = (1\u00b70 + 0\u00b7(-1), 0\u00b70) = (0, 0) = 0/0\n\nAnd apply the multiplication rule to 0 and 1/0:\n\n* 0\u00b71/0 = (0, 1)\u00b7(1, 0) = (0\u00b71, 1\u00b70) = (0, 0) = 0/0\n\nNow apply these rules to fractions that don't have 0 as their denominator, and you'll get the expected results.\n\n---\n\nTell me if I've been clear enough, but that's how operations work on the wheel of fractions :)\n\nYou'll get much more details, with much more complicated words, on how to build a wheel of fractions from a commutative ring in this paper: https://www2.math.su.se/reports/2001/11/2001-11.pdf",

What you do is extending *geometrically* the real line R to the projective real line PR and then extend the arithmetic operations. But the operations are not \"total\", meaning they are not defined on PR x PR, but on a subset of it (for example, \u221ex0 can't be defined). This prevents PR from being a field, a ring, or any other familiar algebraic structure. A \"zero\" is an element in a ring with the property that it \"absorbs\" all the other elements in the ring (that is ax0= 0 for every a in the ring). So since PR is not a ring, we're not dividing by a true zero, but merely dividing by a point that we labelled \"zero\" because that was its name before the extension.\nThe true \"division by zero\" in a proper algebraic structure is only possible in a *Wheel*.",

If you compute 1/ (-0.0001) you end up with a very big negative number. If you define 1/0 to be a constant, then it follows that positive infinity = negative infinity. What's an appropriate name for this constant? Well, let's call it \"infinity\" without the positive/negative adjective. Imagine taking the (real) infinite line, bending it so that positive infinity equals negative infinity. What do you get? A circle. In fact, the projective real line is homeomorphic (read \"it has the same shape\") to the circle. So instead of a line of numbers, you now have a circle of numbers, and the point in which you have glued positive infinity and negative infinity together is the new point, that we called infinity.\nSo if you live on that circle and you start from zero, going either clockwise or counterclockwise you can pass through infinity, merely because it's a point (the north pole if you want) of the circle.\nNote that this construction is only topological (=it involves only the shape of things), it doesn't have an algebraic or metric meaning attached to it.\n\nAlgebraic meaning:  So instead of a line of numbers, you now have a circle of numbers, it doesn't look like a big deal, does it? Well the point is that before you had only one marked number (the zero) with special properties (infinity is not a real number), while now you have defined infinity=positive infinity =negative infinity to be a number, so a marked point on this circle. These two marked points don't mix well together arithmetically, in the sense that there's no possible result of the operation \u221ex0 that preserves the basic properties that numbers have. \n\nMetric meaning: bending the line into a (unit) circle doesn't preserve the standard metric you have on the real line. For example, going from 0 to 1000 is 1 km on the real line, but it's much less on the unit circle. So what does the standard metric on the real line correspond to on the circle? Well it's a metric such that the more you approach infinity, the more space you have to go through.\nSo, if you imagine living on this circle, starting from zero, infinity *is* an actual point on your world, but it takes you an infinite amount of time to get there. It's fair, isn't it?",

If you have two points in a straight line, you'll only be able to see the first one, the second one being covered by the first one. In fact, you see the whole line as a single point. \nIn projective geometry, lines are defined as points. The \"infinity\" corresponds to the horizon.\nThe fact that projective geometry is the appropriate geometry to describe how we perceive the world means it has a lot of real life applications. For example, turning the 3d image of a camera into a 2d photo is exactly a projective transformation.",

We can construct the integers from the naturals by *closing* the addition operation through the extension of negative numbers.\n\nWhen we try the same thing with multiplication, we get the rational numbers. Given `x * 3 = 6` we can use the multiplicative inverse of 3, one third, to solve the equation: `x * 3 * (1/3) = x = 6 * (1/3) = 2`.\n\nWe cannot actually close the rationals under multiplication, because of zero. The closest thing to do is take the set of rational numbers except for zero and treat this as a multiplicative group.\n\nSince zero times anything is zero, we have `0*x = 0`. Since `x = 5` is just as valid a solution as `x = -1`. Since no unique solution for `x` gets determined by the equation, there's no way to assign a consistent value to the multiplicative inverse of zero.\n\nTL;DR: zero times anything is zero, so it's impossible to undo that multiplication and figure out what you started with.",

Specifically, `minus(plus(a,b),b) = a` and `divide(multiply(a,b),b)=a` are both almost always valid statements, except for specific degenerative cases.

Hence Z cannot be in our field and we have to break the closure rule of fields (adding and multiplying elements in a field returns a result in the same field).\n\nNote that this also applied to Algebaric rings as well.

            "comment": "TLDR:\n\n1.  \"i\" is a number like any other. You can add, subtract, multiply, divide it etc. and always gives a single internally consistent answer.\n\n2.  \"i\" represents real values in nature when you're doing certain physics calculations so it's necessary and important that we have it.\n\n3.  5/0 has no answer because nothing, not even Infinity, can be multiplied by 0 to get it to equal anything but 0.\n\n4.  We can rewrite math as we see fit, but there is nothing in nature to my knowledge that would require changing the rules to give 5 / 0 a proper answer.\n\n\nLong Version:\nThere is a subtle but meaningful difference here between \"i\" and diving by 0.\n\nOn The Nature of \"i\":\n\n\"i\" is just a number like any other. We use the moniker \"imaginary\" to describe it, but really \"i\" is not meaningfully different than 2 or 5 or 7.  This bakes our brains a little bit because we can't see \"i\" anywhere on the number line, nor can we hold up \"i\" numbers of fingers and toes.\n\nBut there are real actual things in nature that have a value of \"i\".  In physics, the equations / calculations in electricity and magnetism and / or signal processing often reveal physical quantities that contain \"i\".\n\nFurthermore, because \"i\" is a number like any other, you can perform any and all mathematical operations on it ( addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) and you will always get a single answer which is internally consistent with the rest of mathematics.\n\n\nDividing By Zero:\n\n5 / 0 is basically the mathematical equivalent of asking the question,\n\n\"What number must 0 be multiplied by in order to equal 5\"\n\nBut this question has no meaningful answer.  No number, not even the big boy himself, infinity, can budge Zero from its position even a little (infinity X 0 = 0).  So asking how many zeros it would take to equal the number 5 is just a nonsense question.  It would be like asking,\n\n\"How many Rocky Road ice cream cones does your uncle Charles have to eat in order to grow Santa Claus out of a moon rock.\"\n\nThere simply is no answer.  The equation (5/0) itself  contains the false premise that this particular denominator (0)  could ever be made to equal 5 through multiplication alone.  So I guess the super duper snarky answer to this equation might be, \n\n\"5 / 0 = You made a flawed question.  Try making a better question.\"\n\nCan't We Re-write Math?:\n\nYes actually we can. We just made up all the rules to math anyway.  We could technically write them to say anything we want (5 / 0 = Thanos is Tony Stark's son).\n\nThere is actually an entire field of mathematics called \"non-euclidean geometry\" that is basically based on one person's desire to create a new form of geometry from scratch where two parallel lines would eventually cross one another instead of staying the same distance apart forever.\n\nBut the reason why non-euclidean geometry has value / staying power is that it turns out that on a curved surface like a globe, two parallel lines do actually cross each other if you take them out far enough (If you and your buddy are both standing on the equator facing north and you start walking, your paths are 100% perfectly parallel to start with, but you will bump into each other at the North Pole).\n\nSimilarly, as we discussed previously, in certain equations like the ones in E&amp;M physics and signal processing there are actual real physical quantites whose calculation requires the existence of \"i\".\n\nAnd I'm a physicist not a mathematician, so I definitely can't speak on behalf of the math world.  But as far as I'm aware there are not any real calculations that by their nature would require there to be an answer to the question 5 / 0.\n\nSo I would think it unlikely that a brand new branch of mathematics would be created for the purpose of giving the question 5 / 0 an answer.",

            "comment": "You can! But things break, and ultimately cause more trouble. In particular, let's look at what happens if we assume that we can add division by zero while still keeping our ability to add, subtract, and multiply.\n\nLet's say we define 1/0=\u00a3. What this should mean is that \u00a3 is the value that you can multiply by 0 to get 1.\n\nConsider 0\\*\u00a3=(0+0)\\*\u00a3=0\\*\u00a3+0\\*\u00a3; subtracting 0\\*\u00a3, we get 0\\*\u00a3=0.\n\nThus, 1=0\\*\u00a3=0. And so in a world where we can add, subtract, and multiply, and also divide by 0, all numbers are equal to 0. Which, sure! In that world, all operations have the result 0.\n\nOkay, so we ran into trouble because the normal rules of math would apply multiple values to 0\\*\u00a3; let's look at what rules we lose if we specifically choose the value of 0\\*\u00a3.\n\n0\\*\u00a3 has no value: this is a cop out! If the whole point was to stop having a thing (0) that we couldn't divide by, the solution shouldn't be having a thing (\u00a3) that we can't always multiply by. That said, this is the answer you get if you call 1/0 \"infinity.\" You don't get to multiply 0 times infinity, or subtract infinity from infinity, or divide infinity by infinity. Which means we went from a world where a/0 wasn't defined, but now we have both 0/0 and infinity/infinity undefined.\n\n0\\*\u00a3=1: this means that our little proof above of 0\\*\u00a3=0 can't work any longer. Now, it's entirely meaningless to have 0 such that 0+0 isn't zero, so that part of the proof is fine. And, if we're saying 0\\*\u00a3=1, we should be able to subtract 1 from an equation that basically says 1=1+1. So, what broke? Distributivity. We no longer have (a+b)\\*c=a\\*c+b\\*c. But it's even worse than that. 0=0\\*1=0\\*(0\\*\u00a3)=(0\\*0)\\*\u00a3=0\\*\u00a3=1, so we need to also ditch associativity of multiplication! At which point, without both associativity and distributivity, we no longer have an operation that really deserves to be called multiplication. Note that all of this also holds if we set 0\\*\u00a3 equal to any other already-existing nonzero number.\n\n0\\*\u00a3=0: this means we aren't using the typical understanding of what dividing by a number should give you. But consider 1=0+1=0\\*\u00a3+1=0/0+1/0=(0\\*1+1\\*0)/(0\\*1)=0/0=0\\*\u00a3=0. So again, we lose both distributivity and associativity.\n\n0\\*\u00a3=something new: at this point, if you're careful, you can define what I'm sure others have mentioned: a wheel. In a wheel, division is divorced from multiplication; we lose the fact that x/x=1. Further, subtraction is divorced from addition; x-x is no longer necessarily 0. So you get something, and it's not forced to have all elements equal to zero, and you still have associativity, but you do lose distributivity.",

The inverse property of R suggests that should be 1 if 1/0 is defined. However, the multiplication property of zero suggests it should be 0. In concrete terms, does 0 times 1/0 = 1 as the inverse property suggests, or should it be 0 as the multiplication of zero property suggests?\n\nAs other posters have mentioned, it's totally possible to build a number system in which division by zero is defined, but it changes the properties of R substantially.

With regards to defining sqrt(-1) to be i, we can do so without changing the basic properties of R, only extending them.

We define i as the square root of -1, sure. But the reason the complex numbers are so well-known even to some people outside mathematics is not because people *really* wanted to solve the equation x^2 = -1 but because complex numbers allow us to do all kinds of nifty stuff like represent planar isometries as a combination of multiplication and addition by complex numbers.  \n  \nOf course, one can just answer the question \"Why should we define this?\" with \"Let's just do it and see what happens\". Well, as some other people pointed out in the comments if you do define \"1/0\" or \"infinity\" as an extension to the real numbers you don't get a system that is very interesting. Algebraically your extended system doesn't work out because as people liked to point out the normal rules of multiplication and division don't work anymore in a system with \"1/0\" added.

You have to have a proof that it will hold true\n\nFor example, any integer to the power of 0 = 1. No one just made that up and started using it in calculations. They had to make a proof to know that any integer to the power of 0 does in fact = 1. \n\nSame thing goes for square root of -1 = i.",

            "comment": "The problem is because division is a compressed way of subtracting a number from another number multiple times.  \n\n\nSo, when you take 100 divided by ten, the arithmetic function you are performing is to see how many times you can subtract 10 from 100. So, 100\\-10 = 90\\-10 = 80.... 10\\-10=0. Arithmetically speaking, you would have to subtract 10 from 100 10 times in order to get to zero.  \n\n\nNow, lets try and divide by zero using that mathematical sequence. 100 divided by zero. Now, you get 100\\-0 = 100\\-0=100\\-0=100..... At no point would you reach zero, so it is therefore undefined.  \n\n\nThe next question you might posit is why can't it be stated that anything divided by zero is infinity. At first, it might seem to make sense to identify it as such, but you face another problem if you do so; do you assign \"any number divided by zero\" as \"positive infinity\" or \"negative infinity\"? It would be non\\-sensible for it to be either one, so it cannot be anything but an undefined and non\\-arithmetic construct and therefore unable to remain in any arithmetic formula.",

The idea of \"division\" is simply the multiplicative inverse. Basically, it means that c is the multiplicative inverse of d if cd=1 (and we take this to mean c = 1/d). So, we can essentially combine these two results to find the multiplicative inverse of 0. If we call this element \"e\", then we have. 0e = 1. In the context of a field, there is no such e that will make that statement true. So, we cannot divide by 0.",

And it kinda is.\n\nI say *kinda* because the error getting memed is actually when an *integer* is divided by zero. Remember that integers are counting numbers - 1, 2, 3, etc - and computers have a simplified means of storing and acting on them as binary numbers. This is good for speed and expressing exact (integer) values, but it doesn't allow for *special* values.\n\nI said it was *kind* of an issue because floating point types (decimal numbers like 1.333 or 2.25) do allow for special constant values like you're describing. In most programming languages..\n\n1 / 0 = Positive Infinity\n-1 / 0 = Negative Infinity\n0 / 0 = NaN (short for Not a Number)\n\n...but only for decimal numbers.\n\nHTH",

When it's 0.5, you're multiplying numerator by 2. When denom is 0.1, you're multiplying num by 10. When denom is 0.001, you're multiplying by 1000. The closer to zero the denominator gets, the larger the whole number gets. And you can go as close to zero on the denominator as you want....which means the whole number will get as big as you want (infinity)",

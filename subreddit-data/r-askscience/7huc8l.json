            "comment": "Well the reason the temperature in the past was so much higher is that the high CO2 levels persisted for many thousands of years allowing for the progressive accumulation of water vapor in the atmosphere which accelerated the greenhouse effect. CO2 is actually the second most important greenhouse gas behind water vapor, though it is often the trigger for climatic change because it's concentration in the atmosphere is controlled by a variety of complex processes where as water vapor is effectively controlled by temperature and pressure. Over time the increased temperature has a positive feedback with water in the atmosphere allowing for very elevated temperatures. It's worth noting that when we say the \"the last time\" we are taking a snapshot of a world that had been experiencing those conditions for millenia.\n\nWe currently believe we can keep the warming around 2C because we are projecting mitigation and emission reduction strategies that will eventually slow the warming trend. In the short term (geologically speaking) that means a temperature rise of around 2C.",

I remember 2015 as being the breaking point from which emissions had to rapidly decrease in order to hit the 2C goal, which did not happen, and that even then there would be about a 50/50 chance. Some scientists at the time I was fairly well read, around 2010, strongly argued for a 350ppm concentration goal which required even more drastic actions. ",

I think 2C was always a stretch goal and a relatively arbitrary one chosen because it seemed borderline achievable. Same with 350ppm. I think the situation is pretty grim, but that's not a great message. Regardless, we had better get on this as quickly as possible, no matter how bad the odds are that it will change the trend.",

A single hydrogen atom also doesn't have any rotational or vibrational modes and its absorption spectrum is all electron transitions.\n\nWith diatomic molecules like H2, N2, O2, there are now simple vibrational and rotational modes.   That means the molecule can absorb a photon and start to spin or vibrate.  Those are still fairly simple and quantized, though, and the absorption lines are not very broad.\n\nWith triatomic molecules like H2O or CO2 there are now more complex vibrational and rotational modes available to the module and what happens is that wide bands starts to be absorbed in the infrared.  This is what turns them into a greenhouse gas -- they're still transparent to light in the visible spectrum, but broadly most infrared photons into a gas of sufficient density of CO2 or H2O is going be absorbed.\n\nMethane is CH4 and now has even more vibrational modes (each pair of hydrogen atoms can move in and out and up and down and left and right creating modes, and there's probably more complicated ones than that).\n\nH2SO4 is also a greenhouse gas although its more important as a particulate since it forms sulfate aerosols -- liquid drops -- which cause rayleigh scattering instead of absorption.  The same with H2O which also clearly exists as water vapor in clouds -- but the greenhouse effect of H2O as a gas exceeds its effect as a vapor.",

In short, if a vibration causes a change in the dipole moment of the molecule, the vibration will have a corresponding absorption line in the IR spectrum. So if a vibration of the molecule involves polarized bonds changing their length or angles, it will absorb IR photons. If we have a symmetric diatomic molecule like one of the ones you mentioned, their dipole moment is zero no matter how hard they vibrate, do they don't absorb IR at all. But HF absorbs IR about as strongly as CO2.",

Usually folks have to resort to looking for some proxy molecule such as CO as use an assumed mass ratio.\n\nThe only way H*_2_* is really detectable is through collision-induced absorption; at high densities there are sufficient collisions to deform enough molecules to induce a dipole moments and produce IR absorption lines. Unfortunately this doesn't happen until very far above the density of a typical molecular gas cloud, but is actually the source of most of the atmospheric opacity for giant planets at pressures greater than 1 atm.",

This is a quantum process so it takes a finite amount of energy to excite an electron. If you have too much or too little the photon won't be absorbed. Having multiple vibrational nodes means that the molecule can absorb photons with varying amounts of energy. This basically means that more of the photons from the sun will interact with and be absorbed by methane compared to other, less efficient greenhouse gasses.",

Animal agriculture makes up 2/3rds of released methane. \n\nHowever, that amount of methane is negligible compared to other greenhouse gas sources. For example, in the US, animal agriculture makes up less than 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions. And way less than that would be made up of methane, since not all animal agriculture is cows and not even all GHGs released by cows over their lifespan is methane. \n\nThough I should add that that's currently the amount of methane produced as a source. The influence of cattle will decrease as the globe warms due to other methane sources becoming active. But, either way, methane is honestly not that big of a concern and never really has been. Its short persistence and just lower overall concentration basically nullifies the 23 times more potent aspect.\n\nThat might change in the future, per those other sources I mentioned, but currently carbon dioxide, especially from fossil fuels, is the primary concern by far. And by far, I mean by over 90% of the problem.",

As methane rises into the air, it reacts with the hydroxyl radical to create water vapor and carbon dioxide. **The lifespan of methane in the atmosphere was estimated at 9.6 years as of 2001; however, increasing emissions of methane over time reduce the concentration of the hydroxyl radical in the atmosphere**. With less OH\u02da to react with, the lifespan of methane could also increase, resulting in greater concentrations of atmospheric methane.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_methane#Troposphere\n\nIn other words, it's not in the top two GHGs because\n\n1) It breaks down into the top two (water vapor and co2) and\n\n2) The concentration of methane in the atmosphere is currently small, but that will increase over time",

This is significant in atmospheric sciences because the math is of accumulation rather than just contribution. \n\nThere was an excellent explanation in a letter to The Economist about a few years ago in response to an article that talked about GHG mass release from the melting of the arctic permafrost. Really end of days type stuff. Once the permafrost starts to go, the change cannot be stopped and with be irreversible. Both articles have really stayed with me. \n\nEdit: [this to the article in The Economist](http://www.economist.com/node/21556802) \n\nThis is the piece that always stuck with me: \n\n\u201cOne of the best available guides to this risk is a survey of 41 permafrost scientists published in Nature last year. They predicted that at the current rate of global warming between 48% and 63% of terrestrial permafrost would be thawed to a depth of 3 metres by 2100. In the process, they expected between 7% and 11% of its stored organic matter to be released into the atmosphere. Only a little over 2% of that would be in the form of methane, but this would be responsible for 30-50% of the resultant warming. It would be impossible to prevent these emissions: they would probably continue for centuries.\u201d",

Each GHG has it's own lifetime and GWP (global warming potential), GWP is the \"potency\", its a measure of how much heat it traps in the atmosphere in comparison to CO2. However if it has a very short lifetime (Methane's is about 12 years) it lowers the risk.\n\nYou have to combine that with their abundance in the atmosphere to find the most impactful GHGs today. Believe it or not, water vapour contributes to the majority of the greenhouse effect. CO2 is second, despite these both being incredibly weak GHGs when compared to others. Methane is third, contributing to up to 9% of the greenhouse effect. Fourth is Ozone, and beyond that most gases have a negligible effect.\n\nCO2 has a lifetime of 30-95 years, compared to say, Tetrafluoromethane's lifetime of 50,000 years. It is also 5,000x more potent as a GHG than CO2 over the course of 20 years, but there's next to none in the atmosphere so it's not such a big deal.\n\n",

My old Marine Sciences professor was one of the leading researchers into methane gases and the effect in climate change and ocean systems. One big thing with methane is that there are large pockets of methane trapped in the ice caps so as the ice caps melt with the warming it gets perpetuated greatly by the trapped methane gases escaping. Methane is also a lot worse for warming. My old professor actually testified to congress on the matter and did a week of talks at the capitol.\n\nIf you want to read more into it, I'm sure if you look up Dr. Samantha Joye you could find something on methane research or be sent down the path to research(since most links will be for her research into the BP oil spill- https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0630/Methane-s-hidden-impact-in-Gulf-oil-spill)",

Increase the mean global temperature by one degree, and the water vapor content of the atmosphere will equilibrate in *weeks.*  \n\nThis should make sense to anyone familiar with weather patterns.

Higher CO2 levels meant higher temperatures, which meant that air could (immediately) hold more water vapor.  \n\nAnd the moment CO2 levels / mean temperatures drop is the moment the water is released from the atmosphere.  Yes, it's a feedback mechanism, but it's not one of the truly driving forces behind global warming like CO2.  It's an ephemeral catalyst.  \n",

We have no previous examples to follow and the evidence we do have is limited and not well resolved on a temporal scale.\n\n&gt;So what does the above mean? That we will simply slow warming so much that reaching 2C will take centuries/millennia? What is the time scale envisioned here?\n\nGenerally predictions are made on a time scale of a century or less, most ones today are commonly for 2050 or 2100. I believe 2C is by 2050 and is a 2C rise over the baseline year of 1990. So in roughly 60 years it is predicted to go up by about 2C.\n\nIt is also worth noting that the rate of emissions rise has reduced significantly so the threat of a runaway effect isn't particularly prominent anymore (thankfully). Most of the projections are made with the assumption that the developing world, primarily India, China, and Brazil would follow a similar fossil fuel path the West did in the past. This doesn't seem to be happening, which alone, has made the problem manageable.",

There's a ton of methane locked up in the 10's of millions of square kilometres of polar permafrost regions, and if these regions melt under climate change this adds to methane emissions, which adds to GHG emissions, which leads to more warming, which leads to more permafrost melting, etc. ",

The \"lots of trees\" we have now is a small fraction of the original tree population. The removed tree population couldn't be recovered even 10% without bulldozing buildings and tearing up roads.

Source?\n\nThis review article by Benton &amp; Twitchett is a good summary of the disputed data - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534703000934\nIt's from 2001 so a little dated, but covers the claims that are most usually mentioned (shocked quartz, fullerene isotopes, etc. - most from the 70-80s). I'm aware of the two candidate craters in Antarctica and the Falklands, but I haven't seen anything to suggest they were more than speculation.\n\nMost of the reason the K-T impact was so devastating was not the size of the asteroid or the timing (just after/alogside the Deccan Traps) but due to the location, shallow marine. The gypsum (calcium sulphide/phate) thrown into the atmosphere produced acid rain, and the sulphides in the atmosphere blocked the sun. If the same crater had struck elsewhere, we'd still be dealing with a huge loss of life, but perhaps not such an extensive mass extinction.\n\nAnd sorry for rambling... It's my current project focus atm in uni, so I'm reading all the research I can about it. I'm open to any contradictory articles, like I said earlier. \n\n&amp; I do agree re soft engineering. There are huge consequences to our actions that very little is being done about ... there are actually hypotheses out there that trees are already offsetting our carbon emissions by up to 2x what we currently think!",

So the last time atmospheric CO2 levels were as high as they are today (~ 408 ppm) was about 15 mya (some say more, some say less). Regardless of the exact date, Earth's climate system was considerably different back then than it is today, and so were all of its components - climactic feedback mechanisms, ocean and atmospheric circulation patterns, vegetation coverage, ozone levels, ice cover, concentrations of other GHGs, etc. All of these components contribute (either directly or indirectly) to global temperature. Therefore, although it is important to understand paleotemperature fluctuations and the climactic factors that caused them, comparing our current climactic situation with the past in regards to CO2 concentrations alone isn't necessarily relevant to your question; you have to consider current state of all the system's components. Scientists believe (with high confidence) that the temperature change resulting from GHG emissions can be kept to less than 2\u00b0C relative to pre-industrial levels IF atmospheric concentrations do not exceed 450 ppm CO2eq by 2100. These numbers take into account all the knowledge we have about the current state of the Earth's climate system's components. ",

The air would be more humid, the soil would be moistened. The water body would affect wind flow and air pressure, perhaps increasing precipitation. A forest might be possible, if the huge lake can be sustained. \n\nIt would be a tremendous geo-engineering project, but it would also literally drown the material evidence of the Aboriginal cultural history in central Australia.",

MSR's are far more uncertain as a technology than for instance electric cars, which are already commercially available, and cheaper amortized per mile than gasoline cars at high utilization. And both wind and solar, which in the right areas are already some of the cheapest forms of energy in the world. Not to mention traditional pressurized nuclear, which are a bit expensive, but will probably play a significant role.\n\nYour whole commentary seems a bit off, why for instance do you say there's no alternative for heating, when in fact ground source heat pumps, and combined heat and power are available, widely used, and in fact often profitable. \n\nYou're right that 100% reduction looks unlikely, things like air travel will be very difficult to deal with, and wind/solar will require chemical fuel backup for the foreseeable future. But the targets are for an 80% reduction from 1990 to 2050, which is manageable. I know in the UK we haven't exactly done anything radical, and we're already 40% down from 1990.",

Alongside the atmosphere, the oceans redistribute heat from the equator to higher latitudes. At these high latitudes waters become cold and dense and so they sink, forming what we call deep waters. The 'ocean conveyor belt' (or meridional overturning circulation) is really important in maintaining a climate that is in equilibrium. If we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today then in a very simplistic model we might expect that over a few thousands years deep water would carry a large amount of carbon dioxide down into the deep ocean and atmospheric CO2 would reduce to pre-indutrial levels.\n\nOn the other hand, if the formation of deep water is reduced, via factors like less dense waters in the North Atlantic (as Greenland melts) and changed in wind patterns in the Southern Ocean, then it means less carbon can be taken from the atmosphere in the long term and temperatures could increase dramatically. Right now we think there were times in the past where overall deepwater formation was slow and that is associated with periods of long-term warm temperatures.",

There are many factors in play, of which CO2 is just one.  More of it will always lead to a temperature increase, but the end value depends on a lot more, stuff like how much ice exists near the poles, solar energy, all kinds of stuff.  \n\nSo in a previous \"configuration\", this CO2 level will have led to warmer temperatures at times, and probably colder temperatures at times.

Given the current average temperature of 288 K, the average temperature back then should have been 288 * (1366.4 / 1367)^1/4 = 287.97 K, or some 0.03^o C cooler because of the Sun's change in luminosity.",

That range hasn't gotten more precise since the 70s.\n\nBehind the reductionist headlines what you're seeing is a projection through a date, IE keeping the warming **by 2100** to under 2 degrees C which does not mean that the rate of warmth will slow.\n\nAs to how accurate those projections are? This far they've overestimated the effect of C02 on the actual rate of change significantly, but referring back to that 1-6 degree range that may just be further down the road.",

Moreover, all non-anthropogenic greenhouse gas factors combined since the 1880s would still be slowly cooling down the climate, not warming it.\n\nThe 1 to 6 degrees is also not an accurate figure, and it also has been improved since the 70s. Greenhouse effect on its own is based on physical laws, and can be estimated very well for a given concentration of greenhouse gases - the rest of the climate (albedo, the changes in greenhouse gases, etc) is dynamic and that's where the range widens.\n\nNowadays, the estimates are between 1 and 5 degrees of warming from now, the variance driven mainly by how much more greenhouse gases humans emit. The climate has already warmed by over 1 degree, and fossil fuel combustion has increased CO2 levels by 30% from the base level.",

When Australian summers go from 38^0 C as a maximum coastal city temperature (36^0 C tomorrow is going to *suuuccckkk*) to 44^0 C , we're going to have problems.\n\nNot to mention our big food bowl in the south, which isn't accustomed to this rapid change in temperature. It's already bad enough with the increases in flooding events drowning the crops, now the farmers have to deal with more death by heat too. We can't survive if we can't eat.

Triassic period was around 10 degrees C higher than now and CO2 was 210 ppmV (similar CO2 density as today but earth temps are about 8 degrees C lower right now). Whereas at the end of the Ordovician period CO2 rose to 2,240 ppmV and earth fell into a major ice age. Just saying you can\u2019t look at CO2 alone to predict temps. ",

Consider that, the 3-6C change that we can see in trends is a culmination of years and years of industrial pollution and lack of control technologies. The 2C goal acts as a reference point for the scientific community to understand the amount of CO2 reduction that would be needed to reach such a goal. And unfortunately, even this goal is considered way too optimistic every energy analysis (BP Energy Outlook, IEA annual reports). The 2011 IEA report stated that in 5 years time climate change would be irreversible, and we're starting to see the consequences of the negligence towards these statements now",

            "comment": "The last time atmospheric CO2 was this high, a great many things were different, most of which we have no idea about. In fact, almost everything we do know about climate in that era is through measuring isotope ratios. Great science, but just think how many critical things about the current environment would not be picked up studying isotope ratios. \n\nMore to the point is the recent science pertaining to CO2 sensitivity, which is really the main determinate of how much warming will happen. Current best estimates are around 1.1 to 1.6 degrees C, much lower than the 2.3 degrees implied in the IPCC's projections. On that basis, it is highly unlikely the 2 degree \"threshold\" will be under threat this century, or next.",

Forgive me, I'm just paraphrasing /u/andyzaltzman1 but it seems that CO2 traps water vapor as the greenhouse effect heats up the Earth, and this water vapor also contributes to the GHE, which traps more water vapor, and so on. This process takes hundreds of years to build up to when we last saw CO2 levels similar to the present day, which is why temperatures are different. In a couple hundred years, should CO2 levels maintain this unhealthy growth/level, we will see those temperatures.\n\nAgain, refer to the top comment if you want a more detailed answer. \n",

I'm 32 now and the current books and articles are predicting the point of no return in about 20-30 years. If we can reduce co2 or increase it in say a decade or over 200 years wouldn't that mean that the vapour effects follow suite only lagging behind though? \n\n",

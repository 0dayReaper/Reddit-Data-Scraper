            "comment": "So, whale anatomy is highly specialized for their aquatic lifestyle. There are multiple valves which prevent water from getting into the lungs. Their blowholes can close up, there are valves in their trachea. It is very hard for water to get into their lungs in any significant quantity.\n\nThey can cough if needed. Whales with respiratory infections have been observed to cough. The mechanism is there.",

When allowed to explore enclosures, they quickly learned to avoid this scent because it was associated with the shock. \n\nFast forward to their butterfly stage of life, and they still fastidiously, even frantically avoided the same scent. This is one piece of evidence suggesting some kind of memory transfers between these stages of life\n\nEdit: thank you kind stranger!",

Given the physical limitations of caterpillars and the major change in body / behavior after their metamorphosis, the scientists decided that active avoidance was a clear data point they could track. For example, some butterflies and moths do not have mouths in their adult form, so food preference would be out for that species. \n\nAlso similar research had been done with these species for other research. \n\nI don\u2019t condone causing animals pain, but it should be noted that the animals were not injured by the electrical shocks. Scientific research had a ways to go in recognizing the various kinds of sentience in other creatures, but that doesn\u2019t mean that they have none.",

So a \"painful electric shock\" is enough to cause the animal to react, and that's it. Ever lick a 9-volt? It's not going to kill you, but it's unpleasant, so probably don't do it again. We usually, when using a shock grid, aim for something comparable at the appropriate scale.\n\nArticle that /u/SpoonwoodTangle is likely referencing: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0001736\n\n&gt;&gt;we used classical conditioning to train caterpillars to avoid the odor of ethyl acetate (EA) by pairing it with a mild electric shock. When offered the choice of ambient air or EA-scented air in a Y choice apparatus (Figure 1), naive fifth instar caterpillars showed neither attraction nor aversion to the odor of EA\n\nThey paired a neutral but clear scent with presentation of a mild electric shock. Remember, we aim to *annoy*, almost never to *harm*. It wouldn't make sense to actually injure the organism in any way, unless that's a very specific part of making the experiment work (e.g., surgical blinding of an octopus in one study).",

They were tested both to see how quickly they would cause the desired trained behavior, and how long that behavior would be retained in the absence of the reward or punishment, the retention of training.\n\nA mild electric shock is used because it has a very quick training period and a very long retention, while being easy to administer and causing little pain and no long term damage.\n\nSome interesting side notes from this research. The strongest longest lasting response was not to electricity, but rather nausea. This is why if you eat something and it makes you sick you will be very reluctant to eat that thing again for a significant period of time.\n\nOn the reward side, they found that you could drastically increase the retention time of the training if you did not reward the behavior each time, instead randomly awarding the behavior only some of the times it was performed. Essentially training gambling behavior kept the animals performing the activity much longer after ending rewards.\n\nThe problem with using rewards instead of punishments is that none of the reward based methods had especially good long term retention.\n\nThat's just down to how the animal brain works, we will remember something bad that happened and avoid those conditions for much longer than we will continue to do something that once rewarded us but no longer seems to be doing so.",

We like the idea that it's possible, but it doesn't follow the way things actually work.  There simply is no transfer of memory.\n\nNow there can be a genetic and biological predisposition to behavior, aka instinctual traits or useful abilities right from birth.  But these aren't memories passed down.  They're traits that survived evolution because they had a competitive advantage for survival.",

The adult aversion did not result from carryover of chemicals from the larval environment, as neither applying odorants to na\u00efve pupae nor washing the pupae of trained caterpillars resulted in a change in behavior. In addition, we report that larvae trained at third instar still showed odor aversion after two molts, as fifth instars, but did not avoid the odor as adults, consistent with the idea that post-metamorphic recall involves regions of the brain that are not produced until later in larval development.\n\n&gt; We found that adults that developed from larvae trained at fifth instar recalled their larval experience, whereas those that were trained at third instar did not",

I used to think it was sort of a slow transition from caterpillar to butterfly, where halfway along you might see something that looks like a caterpillar that started sprouting wings. Nope. Apparently when it forms a cocoon it just turns into mush soup, and the cells just sort of rearrange (totally oversimplfying it). This makes the experiment so much crazier, because none of the caterpillars body parts or organs are even the same. It's more like an entirely new organism that somehow (we assume from the experiment) retains memories of a prior life.",

But there's no reason to believe those responses to stimuli constitute memories, by which most people mean \"something recallable.\"\n\nThis is because there's no reason to believe an insect can engage in metacognitive acts such as recall.

Those structures may be required in vertebrates, but why should they be required in brains with a completely different architecture? We do know that insects *can* remember facts. For example, honeybees can remember where a food source is, and even communicate that to other honey bees by waggle dancing.\n\n&gt;behavioral regulation and includes some ability for learning behavior.

Perhaps if these were alien life from another planet there wouldn't be any reason to think so (though even in that case one could make an argument from instrumental convergence - evolution might arrive at a similar implementation to solve the same problem), but these are part of the same tree of life, where many things are deeply preserved across distantly related phyla.

Our brains are 3x larger than a chimpanzees; if only 1/3rd of our brain runs all our bodily functions then for most animals size should barely make a difference.  Why would you need more \"thinking\" brain just to think about having bigger hands?  It doesn't make sense.  Do you think it really requires any more brainpower for a blue whale to swim than it does for a fish?  Compared to their weight, they might as well have the same number of muscles and bones.  An animal 1000x our size does not have 1000x as many limbs, or 1000x more complex reflexes, or 1000x as many nerves.\n\nThe number of nerves in your body are not even close to proportional to weight.  It's *vaguely* related to surface area, since you have tons of nerves in your skin (ever think about how accurately you can feel things inside you? *not very*).  A blue whale obviously cannot feel things on its skin with the same precision a human can.  Even relatively close animals, like a horse, can't feel things nearly as well.",

We tend to dramatically overestimate the cognitive abilities or at least the emotional responses of animals, especially those that cohabitate with people.\n\nYou look at your dog and you see a furry four legged human with identical thoughts, feelings, and emotional responses to you, humans do this, it's called anthropomorphism and it's how we came up with gods, because we saw natural forces the same way.\n\n&gt; And even then, some domestic animals probably have completely different internal lives than we\u2019d expect.\n\nYou've just made an assumption that animals **have** an internal life. You have no actual evidence for this, but you believe it.\n\nIt's what makes these conversations so hard. Lots of animals are capable of highly complex reactions to environmental stimuli. For that matter so are plants and fungi. A tree is able in some way to make something like decisions based on its state as a whole even though it doesn't appear to have any kind of central structure to support this.\n\nAnimals can travel long distances and communicate at least some information between them.\n\nThese are amazing things, but we jump straight from here to your dog having a human like internal monologue and visual memory.",

I don't know if that's a good comparison when comparing brain structures used for the same activity/purpose.\n\nThat's actually a concern that a number of researchers into animal cognition had for a long time. As a result, they refused to use human emotions in describing the experiences animals had. However, they found as a result that there was a lot of data and knowledge that was being dismissed that was completely legitimate, and a certain level of anthropomorphism is actually very helpful in understanding animal behavior and cognition. \n\nFor example, while a dog may not have \"that sublime feeling when you discover a new subatomic particle\", they do have, \"love, family bond, anxiety\" and more. \n\nDifferent emotions and tools for cognition evolved at different points, meaning that if that evolution happened before the species branched, there's a decent chance whatever cognition/emotion there is exists in a comparable state between both species. And on top of it, like eyeballs, some traits of cognition evolve in parallel.\n\nSo saying we *can't* compare is just as much misleading (if not moresoe) than saying they have exactly the same emotions.",

That would be silly.\n\nA good scientific theory should be falsifiable. \"Insects are incapable of episodic memory (because I will declare any learning behavior they do manifest as implicit memory)\" is not falsifiable.",

And supply a reason.\n\nBut we don't know most of what you've written, and your logic is lacking.\n\nThings we do know are still sketchy. Remember it's only relatively recently we decided fish could indeed feel pain. And yet we'd been re-assured that if they could it was a 'response'. And that's not the only thing that's been corrected in recent years. \n\nWe certainly don't know about things that we haven't looked for. And if you look, you may well find evidence of insects thinking. My favourite example is this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zs_3FHh3z4o which could be taken as evidence of thought. And there are other examples if you search for them.\n\nRegarding your logic - it's the same logic as this: \"Wheels are needed for travel on roads. Tanks don't have wheels. Therefore tanks can't travel on roads.\"\n\nWe simply do not know the range of neural structures that may lead to thought and recall. We don't even know properly how the structures that we do know about work. And we are sure there are things that we have not yet discovered. \n\nOverall - 3/10 imo. Nice words. But bad logic and faulty conclusions written in permanent marker instead of pencil.",

This doesnt disprove a continuuance of the old material to new....but it does imply a complete re-structuring, down to the DNA level. It's possible that some knowledge (for lack of a better word) is retained by the individual butterfly. But I think it's more likely that the butterfly effectively emerges as a new creature and relies on inherited/genetic memory to guide its behavior.\n\nI personally like the idea of each individual butterfly having some connection to its past form and experiences. Probably doesnt make a big difference to the butterfly, though.",

There are sea animals that lose their brain completely when they pass from a moveable to a sessile form (It is mentioned on the book I of the vortex: from neurons to self by Rodolfo Llin\u00e1s).\n\nInterestingly in Brazil there is a nursery rhyme that asks if the butterflies remember when they were caterpillars: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjgABP-gMI8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjgABP-gMI8)",

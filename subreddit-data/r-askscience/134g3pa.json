            "comment": "(Note: in the answer below I'm assuming you're talking about an American Football)\n\nThe spinning football doesn't add any \"power\" to the throw, and in fact, if football was played in a vacuum (say, we all played on the Moon), the spinning ball wouldn't impact the distance of the throw at all. So as you can probably guess from this information, the reason has to do with air resistance. \n\nHow much air resistance an object feels in a given atmosphere depends on a couple of things- speed is the first one (the faster you travel, the more drag) and not so much the size of the object, but the cross sectional area of the object in the direction of motion (this is simplified, but the main thing we care about). So, if you look \"nose on\" to a football, the cross sectional area is less than if you look at the football from the side. So, what you want, to have the least amount of drag on the ball, is for the ball to travel with its nose facing the direction of travel, not the side. \n\nAdding a spiral to the ball makes it more likely that the nose of the ball will face the direction of travel. Why? Because a spinning ball has angular momentum, and thus it takes a torque to change that momentum. Gravity is pulling perpendicular to the torque, so it can't change the angular momentum, so the only change comes from a little bit of air resistance. Thus, with a \"tight spiral\" (which really just means it left the hand without a wobble, and is spinning fast), the ball will keep doing that during it's flight. But a ball that leaves the hand wobbly will keep wobbling, which means the ball will have more air resistance than it would have otherwise.",

A spinning ball itself can create lift -- which is how something like a curve ball can actually change direction during the throw. Is something like this in play when it comes to something shaped liked an American football?",

            "comment": "Spin can have a significant impact on the flight and distance of a ball, particularly in sports like golf, tennis, soccer, and baseball. \n\nIn general, spin refers to the rotation of a ball around its axis, and it can be either backspin (rotating in the opposite direction to the ball's motion) or topspin (rotating in the same direction as the ball's motion). When a ball has backspin, it creates an area of low pressure above the ball and high pressure below it, which causes the ball to lift and stay in the air longer. This lift effect is known as the Magnus effect and is particularly noticeable in sports like golf and tennis, where the ball is hit with a relatively flat trajectory. You can commonly observe golf balls lifting after being driven due to the Magnus effect.\n\nOn the other hand, when a ball has topspin, it creates an area of high pressure above the ball and low pressure below it, which causes the ball to drop more quickly and bounce more sharply. This effect is particularly noticeable in sports like baseball, tennis and soccer, where the ball is kicked or thrown with a more upward trajectory. \n\nIn terms of distance, the amount of spin on a ball can have a significant impact on its flight. In general, a ball with backspin will travel farther than a ball with topspin, as the Magnus effect creates lift that helps the ball stay in the air longer. However, there are exceptions to this rule, particularly in sports like baseball, where a ball with topspin can travel farther if it is hit with a high launch angle and a lot of exit velocity. Overall, the effects of spin on a ball and aerodynamics can be complex and depend on a variety of factors, including the type of spin, the speed and angle of the ball's trajectory, and the specific conditions of the environment in which the ball is flying.\n\nA spinning ball also causes turbulance which allows factors such as wind to act on a larger area as the turbulance effectively increases the size of the ball. American football differs as the spin aids the ball in flight by stabalising the object much like the lands on a rifle barrel help stabalise a bullet by affording rotation. Also, the American footbal when tumbling would generate more surface area and thus drag slowing it down and dramasitcally effecting the length of travel.",

            "comment": "It makes it go farther, which means it retains its power longer. It\u2019s not *more* powerful, just more powerful than it would have been without the spin. \n\nSpin stabilizes projectiles by curving air around them and through gyroscopic force. It\u2019s the reason gun barrels (except for shotguns) are \u201crifled\u201d, because they spin the bullet as it travels down them.",

            "comment": "[Hoop rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoop_rolling) is an extremely old game that dates back to at least ancient Greece. Anyone who has ever played it (or done something similar like rolling a quarter along the ground) can tell you that a single wheel or hoop can roll quite a long distance and in pretty close to a straight line without a huge amount of trouble. That's especially true if you're able to follow along with it and sort of tap it when it starts to veer to one side or the other. Which is exactly what you have to do if you're riding the very earliest kind of bicycle, the velocipede, which is propelled by running along the ground. From there, it's not a stretch to notice that the speed of a device like that is really limited by your running speed, and that it seems to need less intervention the faster it moves -- which gets you to thinking about ways to propel the device more quickly via human power.\n\nAs to why it took so long for the bicycle to be invented after the wheel, I think the answer is probably quite complicated but is almost certainly linked to 1) the amount of skill and time required to design and build something that is plausibly functional even as a velocity is quite substantial. Material constraints would have been a big problem (although the first velocipede was made almost entirely out of wood, it still used metal for things like bushings and tires, and for most of human history making things out of metal was very expensive). The simple availability of surplus labor would have been an issue too. In much of pre-modern agricultural history, in order to support a society, most people had to spend most of their time farming. And I think one last major issue would have been road quality. Bicycles in general, and especially early bicycles, don't handle rough terrain particularly well. In the early history of the bicycle, they were banned in some places because riders really preferred to ride on the sidewalk/pavement rather than the road, which was interfering with pedestrian traffic.\n\nI think it all really almost certainly comes down to resources. With about the same amount of time, effort, and material it takes to build two bicycles, which are basically only suited for individual human transportation (at least before modern construction and infrastructure), you can build a simple cart that can carry hundreds of pounds of stuff at a time. That seems far more useful than a bicycle. I wouldn't be surprised if hundreds or even thousands of individual cart makers who had more time and money than sense experimented with things that looked kind of like bicycles from the invention of the wheel up to roughly the 1800s, but those inventions probably never went anywhere for the reasons I discussed.",

There's no way you'd want 19th century bikes with 2nd century cobbled or dirt roads, for sure.\n\nAn ancient Han wood and horn time-traveler influenced trekking bike might be just the thing to see the ancient world on, though, as a time traveling traveler.

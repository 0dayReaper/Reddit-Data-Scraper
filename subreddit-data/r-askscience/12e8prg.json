    "postText": "I came across a post of 2 sea shells from different oceans being inversely identical, making them latch into each other with ease. It peaked my curiosity of how actually sea shells curve are created or how direction of curve is influenced.\n\nAs in like are they influenced by which hemisphere they are born in? Or like ocean currents? Idk just scratching my brain. \n\nCuz having two identical shells with similar dimensions that are able to latch into each-other but are not from the same local region is a legendary coincidence.",

            "comment": "It's actually controlled by only a few simple parameters and differential growth.  Basically, imagine you're a snail starting out with a teeny tiny shell like a cone.  You want to grow the shell as you do.  If you grow evenly, you just get a long, straight cone.  But if you grow one side faster than the other, you get a curve.  The bigger the discrepancy, the tighter the curve, until you get a tight spiral.  Now add a \"bias\" in, so that you not only curve, but shift to the right or left as you do.  Boom, conical snail shell.  All of these various shapes are just the product of a few parameters about growth rates varying.",

Unless I have totally misremembered things, though, there is a temperature effect on crystals that also has an impact on shell form. I don't think it is enough to control spiral direction though, just tightness of the curvature.\n\nI just did a quick search, and apparently the direction of spiral is a consequence of the chirality (non-mirror image aspect) of a gene that governs shell formation. Righthandedness of spiral is dominant but there are some oddball lefthanded spirals and apparently, the compounds that code leftward shell formation are also reversed, something that has only been revealed because of advances in genetics over the past couple decades.  Basically, the microscopic shape of the intermediate compounds controls the macroscopic shape.  Most life on earth only has the right-handed shell spiral gene, for some reason (it isn't a requirement since both directions are possible).  Pretty interesting stuff.",

Both have radial symmetry which is one of the most common growth pattern that evolution has deemed successful. Starfish also possess radial symmetry, meaning in a circular pattern.\n\nI would also wager that it would be very easy to repeat that as most of those shells have an average size as all animals do and you could repeat it again by selecting the measurements for each making it possible.",

These have a top and bottom shell, so it is possible to find two that fit together, but they won't look the same. \n\nTo explain the symmetry, take your hands (if you have two) and put them together with them curved. If you now keep your wrists together but move your fingers apart, this is how a bivalve opens and closes, with the right and left sides matching. Now, for a brachiopod, keep your hands the same way, but open your fingers like you are doing the star trek hand signal thing, with your middle and ring fingers separating. Now you have a top and a bottom shell that are not the same size/shape, but the right and left of the top shell are symmetrical to each other, and same for the right and left of the bottom shell. \n\nBrachiopods also have slightly different hinges - they have grooves and ridges in theirs kind of like interlocking teeth, that help them stay aligned and together. These groves and ridges are different from species to species, so it is less likely that one would find some that fit together if they are not the exact same size and species.",

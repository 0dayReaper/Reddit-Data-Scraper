Something about women being able to pick a mate that was high in certain things they were low in, except for the women on the pill. I\u2019d never heard that before. Is that true? \n\n\nI have heard that it changes who you\u2019re attracted to based on physical features ie. from testosterone levels, and looked at past questions here about it. So that does seem to happen, or at least be a likely hypothesis, but I\u2019m also wondering how significant that effect is? Would that happen to every woman that takes it? And how strong an effect is it?",

There is also evidence to suggest flu viruses can form gel-like coats in cold Winter temperatures which aid survival - theres obviously no evidence yet whether nCoV does this since its so recent. \n\nOur nasal mucous, a first line of defence against pathogens, is also cleared less efficiently in cold temperatures, meaning viral particles have a better opportunity to start an infection.\n\nSocial:\nPeople generally spend more time closer together in the Winter, think from the level of snuggling up to keep warm to having extended family and/or friends together during Winter celebrations (Xmas, New Year, Diwali to name a few). Theres debate how much these impact viral transmission since we are around people all year round, but perhaps it has a small part to play and is worth mentioning.\n\nTheres also changes such as the University/school year starting around September/October, which mixes a lot of new students together who can spread viruses VERY quickly and also then transmit to parents etc.",

                    "comment": "The key as to why things like influenza can continually infect people year after year in is its ability to mutate, or more specifically antigenic drift and antigenic shift.\n\nBut first some immunology....\n\nAntigens are little proteins in most cases on the outer surface of cells or viruses, that when seen by our white blood cells, trigger an immune response. Things like animal proteins or nut proteins can be \"antigenic\" in that they trigger an immune response in our body. But in terms of infection, the way we fight infection and build immunity (which we call adaptive immunity...ie: the ability to adapt) is by having our white blood cells eat up a virus (or bacteria) and break it up in to small pieces. Then it presents the different pieces (usually proteins from the virus surface) up for presentation to other types of white blood cells, which will present it as an antigen saying \"this is a bad protein, we need to build an attack against this exact protein\". The other white blood cells then recruit an army to build attack proteins called antibodies released by a specific type of white blood  cell called a plasma cell. This plasma cell launches an attack by releasing antibodies which neutralizes the virus by attaching to that exact \"antigen\" or protein it was made against.... a kind of targeted immunity. This process may take from 1-2 weeks the first time you are exposed to the antigen/virus. Once you fight off the virus, the majority of your plasma cells are not needed anymore, so they die, and you get some memory cells which remember that antigen in case it returns. Once you get exposed to it again, it recognizes it, and quickly replicates the plasma cell pool and you have a very quick response to get rid of that same antigen and its host (the virus). However, if that virus mutates the proteins on its surface in some way, then it is no longer presenting the previously seen antigens and you cannot recognize it as it appears different. Thus you would have to build immunity to it again..... phew...ok now that we're through that...onto Influenza.\n\nThink of antigenic drift as kinda drifting in your lane as you drive down the highway. You might go from line to line but generally you can stay between the lines despite moving.  Drift is when a virus has small mutations that change enough of the virus to allow it to be antigenically different. Influenza A uses antigenic drift to slightly mutate the surface proteins just enough to have sightly different surface proteins so that someone who saw a Influenza A subtype before, can get infected by a different Influenza A, however you may have some protection, or not everyone will be affected because they may have seen a similar variant in the past (through being infected or a vaccine). Antigenic shift is when you change lanes over to an adjacent lane. If a virus mutates such that while it used to infect pigs, its mutation allows it to now infect humans, then it is a completely different virus (like the new coronavirus), which means noone has any immunity to it since it has completely different surface proteins. Thats what happened with H1N1 etc.\n\nVaccines work by introducing a dead virus with its \"antigens\" and some immune modulators to boost our immune system, into our body. Our natural adaptive immunity then builds those plasma cells and their antibodies so that when you see the real live virus, you can launch a targeted attack against it and beat it very quickly. So you can still get infected with the virus after getting the vaccine but it might look like a cold rather than the full blown flu. This is of course if your body has had enough time to build that immunity (at least 10 days) or you are not immunosuppressed (pregnant, elderly with chronic diseases, on steroids or immunosuppressive medication, infants etc). The flu/influenza vaccine works by looking at the strains circulating in Australia in their previous season, and developing vaccines according to those strains for North America and Europe, with the hope that those strains are somewhat similar. Of course by the time it reaches us, it might be slightly different so those vaccines might not be entirely effective. In addition, getting yearly influenza vaccines allow us to build protection to multiple variants over the years so in case a mutation leads to a previously similar antigen seen maybe 10-15 years ago, you already have that immunity. This of course doesnt work for antigenic shift, as it would be too different.\n\nIm not a virologist (Im a Family Medicine resident with a background in Cell Biology), but I dont think coronavirus has the same features of antigenic drift and shift.  I could be wrong, so I wont comment more about that.\n\nTL;DR: The small (and somethings bigger) mutations that influenza undergoes yearly allows it to be slightly different so our immune systems dont recognize it, thereby allowing it to infect us year after year, unless we get vaccines yearly.\n\nIn case that was confusing, watch this youtube clip from 3:33 to 6:00 mins for clarification.\n\n[https://youtu.be/85R-6O6rrgw?t=212](https://youtu.be/85R-6O6rrgw?t=212)",

Singapore may be able to help provide some answers soon. \n\nSingapore currently has 13 infections, all of them mainland Chinese tourists who are being kept in isolation in two Singapore Hospitals. All of them mingled to a greater or lesser extent with the local population before being admitted (139 close contacts have been identified and 134 of those have already been traced and are being monitored). It is still the incubation period but so far no locals have been reported as being infected. The next two weeks will be very instructive  as it will show how widely this group  infected others in a country they were visiting. From that we will get better idea of the virus\u2019s potential. Fortunately Singapore has the expertise and infrastructure to get a good handle on this and provide reliable data.\n\n\n\nUpdate: \n\nThere are now 18 cases in Singapore. 17 are mainland Chinese tourists who travelled from Wuhan, the other is a Singaporean who travelled back from Wuhan on the recent evacuation flight. There are still no reported local transmissions. \n\nTwo resources from the Singapore Ministry of Health are linked below.

If you're in developing country it's difficult to tell but your chance of contracting the virus is much higher because the people who already have the virus have likely not be isolated thus you may get it from them.\n\nOverall your chance of contracting Corona is quite low, just take safety precautions such as staying away from people who seem sick. Sanitise your hands and eating surfaces.",

A reported 3% mortality rate means that the actual rate is lower -- the hard part is knowing how much lower. To see why, think about how these rates are computed. It's literally # dead / # infected. The thing is that deaths and severe illnesses are easy to count, but mild illnesses are not. People who feel like they have a bad cold are unlikely to go to the doctor and get diagnosed, especially in the middle of cold and flu season. That means mild cases get undercounted, which inflates mortality rate estimates.",

But most unreported cases are going to be on the mild side.\n\nMy background is in food web and ecosystem modeling, with a focus on networks.

I highly recommend Hans Rosling's book on this very topic called \"factfullness\". He also happens to have been an epidemiologist (the type of doctor that manages epidemics). One way to look at it is by dividing populations into groups that earn under $2 a day; between $2-$8 a day; between $8-$32 and those that earn over $32 (us). Similarly these lines are arbitrary. To give context, the group with the worst teeth is the $8-32 group. This group has sufficient infrastructure to get sugar and coca-cola (and coronavirus), but insufficient public health spending to promote toothpaste and fluoride in the water (and isolation rooms in hospitals).",

For each of these they did a bunch of interviews and collected a bunch of samples.

Another anonymous expert who I believe works for a Guagnzhou-based gene sequencing company, received several samples and determined their gene sequence with a technique called 'mNGS'. With some subsequent bioinformatic analysis, he was shocked to discover a new virus which is quite similar to SARS-CoV. He then share his foundings with his colleagues, and wrote a technical explanation which went viral within my circle.

Reported illnesses have ranged from infected people with little to no symptoms to people being severely ill and dying.* \n\nIn the case of SARS, a couple of people fairly early on in the disease went to Hong Kong, from whence it spread to Toronto among other places, spreading the disease where it was basically previously unknown yet reporting on cases and fatalities was accurate.\n\nIn contrast, this outbreak started at least as early as December in Wuhan, and there is skepticism about the reliability of numbers.  \n\nThere are multiple points of uncertainty:\n\n\\- Have all infected patients been recognized?\n\n\\- Have all fatalities been tabulated?\n\n\\- How long does it take to die from the disease?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis last point may sound crass, but it is actually important.  If there are 11,000 ill, (and yesterday 8,000), then 3,000 were diagnosed only one day ago.  You can't simply divide 250 (dead)/11000 (infected) and get a fatality rate.\n\nThere was [similar uncertainty](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/2003_05_07a/en/) during the SARS epidemic:\n\n*On the basis of more detailed and complete data, and more reliable methods, WHO now estimates that the case fatality ratio of SARS ranges from 0% to 50% depending on the age group affected, with an overall estimate of case fatality of 14% to 15%.*\n\nIt's also notable that the fatality rate may depend on many factors.  A couple of major ones are:\n\n\\- Demographics (age, general state of health).\n\n\\- Appropriate and timely treatment.",

Two other  coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people  (MERS and SARS). 2019-nCoV is more genetically related to SARS than  MERS, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While  we don\u2019t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS  and MERS, we can use the information from both of these earlier  coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of  these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread  from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or  weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be  spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no  evidence to support transmission of 2019-nCoV associated with imported  goods and there have not been any cases of 2019-nCoV in the United  States associated with imported goods. Information will be provided on  the [2019 Novel Coronavirus website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html)\u00a0as it becomes available.\n\nSource: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html)",

Few will transmit to 4 people. Many won't transmit to anyone. The risk is fairly easily managed. \n\nr0 makes no statement on how difficult it is to control the spread. Only on how much you need to reduce it to stop the spread.\n\nEg measles is the gold standard for airborne contagion, with an r0 of 12-18.

Can you isolate it one day, then, three days later, you can and we are seeing in the cases that are in the hospital. We've seen people had detectable virus, then they didn't have detectable virus. Then three days later, they had detectable virus. We're using the virus cultures right now and these individuals more to help us learn about this virus. How much asymptomatic carriage in fact is there? So I want people to understand that distinction. We're not using it as a release criteria, because we don't know the natural history of how this virus is secreted.

For example, how many more people are infected and show minimal symptoms and recover without ever being recorded? This is one factor that can cause the current estimate of 2% to be higher than the real rate.\n\nBut also consider that the 2% estimated currently is based on Deaths:Infected. If you only look at the confirmed cases of deaths and infections, then for the fatality rate to remain at 2% ALL of the current infected must recover fully and not die. That is highly unlikely. \n\nAnother way to look at fatality is deaths:recovered, which is at around 50% right now. But a 50% fatality rate is also extremely inaccurate because of the small sample size and various factors that can influence early deaths.\n\nMore time and data is needed before fatality rate can be determined. For example, SARS was initially thought to have a 3-4% mortality rate, which was then revised to be much higher later on (around 9-12% i believe).",

Once the treatment improves over coming weeks/months and we have a better picture of how many people who get sick actually die, I would be VERY surprised if it's even 1%.\n\nAnd to put it in perspective - if you got the flu, would you think \"okay, well, this is my 1/1000 dice roll, do I die?\" No, of course not. Normal healthy adults often times don't even see a doctor when they get the flu.\n\nIMO it's the worst case of media fearmongering over an illness we've seen yet.\n\nZika may have been worse because the health implications were borderline nonexistant for the general public, and an ounce of logic protected you from literally any side effects, but, this is pretty bad too.",

The E score for the results were above 15000 iirc which is comical. Here's a link explaining what an E value is in a little more depth. http://www.metagenomics.wiki/tools/blast/evalue\n\nTo keep it brief, the E value is how many results you can expect from your search in the BLAST database that would align with your sequence. A good fit will be much smaller than .01. An E value of 15000, which you get from that tiny sequence, means that in a random database of sequences, you'll get a whopping 15000 hits from your search.

To compare them to anything, I would advise using a sample of at least 1%, which is 260 to 320 bases. However, each genome has conserved / universal sites (genes have start and stop markers, \"promoters\" and \"terminators\" and comparing these, one would conclude that all life on Earth is pretty much the same) and variable / specific sites. This needs to be taken into account when trying to determine common ancestors.\n\nLancet also says:\n\n&gt; Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 2019-nCoV fell within the subgenus Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus, with a relatively long branch length to its closest relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, and was genetically distinct from SARS-CoV.",

Two other coronaviruses have emerged previously to cause severe illness in people (MERS and SARS). 2019-nCoV is more genetically related to SARS than MERS, but both are betacoronaviruses with their origins in bats. While we don\u2019t know for sure that this virus will behave the same way as SARS and MERS, we can use the information from both of these earlier coronaviruses to guide us. In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient temperatures. Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of 2019-nCoV associated with imported goods and there have not been any cases of 2019-nCoV in the United States associated with imported goods.

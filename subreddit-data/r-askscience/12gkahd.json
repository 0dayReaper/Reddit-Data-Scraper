            "comment": "&gt; are there set rules one could follow about how rivers erode land, how quickly large boulders move down a mountain, and how the land generally changes shape due to soil deposition?\n\nYes, but there are not *single* rules. Rather we have developed a variety of *process equations*, i.e., mathematical expressions that *approximate* the behavior of different systems, for things like erosion in rivers or transport of materials on a hillslope or deposition. The trick for all of these, you have to determine not only the right values for parameters within these, but also the appropriate process equation. That last question, is effectively asking, \"What aspects of a given process are actually important to simulate in my area to get close to the right answer.\" To make this last point more clear, let's consider the example of trying to \"roll back the clock\" for river erosion. \n\nFor erosion in bedrock rivers, one of the most common (and simplest) process equations for erosion is the so-called stream power equation where erosion (*E*) is given as:\n\n    E = K x A^(m) x S^(n)\nand *K* is a constant encapsulating details of the erodibility of rocks but also climate (basically average precipitation, so we could break K in something like *K-lithology* and *Runoff ^(m)*), *A* is drainage area, *S* is slope, and *m* and *n* are constants related to some details of how bedrock is eroding within the rivers and how the discharge scales with drainage are in the river. There are definitely examples of people using this form of an erosion equation to \"invert\" river profiles in an attempt to both determine what the forcings were (e.g., what was the uplift rate), but also theoretically to reconstruct what the landscape looked like (e.g., [Roberts et al., 2012](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012TC003107), [Fox et al., 2014](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014JF003196), [Goren et al., 2014](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JF003079)), [Rudge et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014JF003297), etc.). These are usually hyper simplified in that they set *n* equal to 1 to make the math simpler (even though we generally think this exponent should be closer to 2 if you're assuming this simple stream power equation, e.g., [Lague, 2014](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/esp.3462)).\n\nNow, the above stream power equation makes a lot of assumptions. For example, that (1) erodibility and precipitation are constant in space and time and (2) that any amount of water flowing over the bed does erosion. But this means that to \"invert\" you only need to make some assumptions about the erodibility and average precip and assume that drainage area has stayed fixed. The question are these reasonable assumptions? For point 2, in many places we think that there is a threshold to erosion, i.e., only a given portion of the stream power represented by the original equation actually erodes the bed, specifically only the part above a threshold (*Psi*), such that:\n\n    E = K x A^(m) x S^(n) - Psi\nSo now we might need to characterize *Psi*, but this is still assuming it's constant, when in fact it might vary with rock type and/or erosion rate (e.g., [Shobe et al., 2018](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2017JF004575), [Shobe et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001282522100218X)). For point 1 from above, this assumes that river discharge is always constant and is the same as the average, but river discharge varies with time, effectively representing a distribution of river discharge or runoff, such that we maybe need to include a the probability distribution of runoff in our equation (*pdf(R)*) such that:\n\n    E= K-lith x (pdf(R) x A)^(m) x S^(n) - Psi\nthat we would actually need to integrate across the possible range within *pdf(R)* and we end up accounting for that not only is there a threshold for erosion, but that not all flows will overcome this threshold. We could keep going and at this point we haven't even touched things like variability in lithology, temporal changes in the distribution of runoff, or the role of sediment within streams, among other very important details. Similarly, we haven't touched on the aspect that estimating some of these parameters is *very hard* and will effectively be different across different landscapes (e.g., *K*). We could similarly think about how much complexity we want to or need to include in the way we represent hillslopes, e.g., do we consider hillslope sediment transport to linear or nonlinear and/or with or without a limiting gradient (e.g., [Roering et al., 2001](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1029/2001JB000323), [Roering et al., 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X07006061)).\n\nA great example of asking your question in a more formal way (and considering many, but not all, of the above options) comes in a trilogy of papers published a few years ago (e.g., [Barnhart et al., 2020a](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2018JF004961), [Barnhart et al., 2020b](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JF004963), [Barnhart et al., 2020c](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JF005287)). In these papers, the authors took a location where they had a reasonable constraint on what the landscape looked like in the past (basically, there's been an incision event into a relatively smooth set of surfaces that started at a known time) and they systematically test which parameters or forms of different fluvial erosion and hillslope transport equations are needed to reproduce the modern topography. There is a lot of nuance (why it's spread across three papers), and their answer is not necessarily global, but it highlights that you need to consider both values of individual parameters but also which way to represent processes to be able to go about trying to answer a question like this.\n\n**TL;DR** We (geomorphologists) have developed a variety of mathematical expressions to describe erosion and sediment transport, but they are non-unique, i.e., we have different ways of representing the same global process, e.g., fluvial erosion. The level of complexity varies between them (and thus the number of parameters needed but also the accuracy of the results) so it's not necessarily a straightforward task to \"roll back the clock.\" That being said, you can (and people do) pick one of the simpler versions and try to use these expressions to \"invert\" for the past form of the landscape. It's challenging to test whether their answers are correct in most cases, but there are methodologies to try to assess the accuracy of these inversions.",

Because the changes in plants and animal communities are driven by many, many factors, and it is not a one-way mathematical Direction.\n\nFirst off the time scale has significant impact.  If you go back far enough in time the weather could have been drastically different and even continental drift becomes a sizable Factor.  In the John Day Fossil Beds in Oregon it's fascinating to consider that Not only was it a wet jungle in a place that is now dry scrubland - but it wasn't even *Oregon* then in any recognizable sense as the continent was in a different place and shape.\n\nPlant communities all around the world are undergoing quite rapid changes now by historical standards because of humans rolling introducing new species which tend to escape.\n\nIn the region where I live there are normal and predictable geological processes.  But there were also Ice Age floods that changed whole river basins and stripped land to bedrock over hundreds of miles.   Before plants had established themselves and held things down there were massive areas of wind erosion and deposition that created the Palouse Hills.\n\nAnd the sagebrush steppe ecosystem that covers much of the West is being displaced by invasive grasses that change the fire regime and negatively and positively impact certain species of Wildlife.\n\nThe displacement of certain plant species like deep-rooted perennial grasses with annual grasses also speeds up erosion processes since they don't root so deeply or cycle nitrogen the same.  Which in turn affects the geology.\n\nIn summary, plant communities have a tremendous impact on the stability of a landscape.  And they are ever changing.",

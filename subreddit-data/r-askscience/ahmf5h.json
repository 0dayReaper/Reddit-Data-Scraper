I didn't get why we would use a unit that describes a quantity when we already have a quantity related unit that is the mass, especially when we know how to weight things.

The chemistry behind reactions is dependent on the number of molecules present, not their mass. \nTo put more simply, it's more important to know many ingredients you have for making a hamburger, then it is to know how much the ingredients weigh. It's more important to have two buns instead of just knowing you have 100g of buns.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention that the OPs question is not stupid, and is completely reasonable. As some others pointed it, it would be a good opportunity for the teacher to emphasize the importance of moles vs mass.",

And you can't just rely on mass to tell you how much of a substance you have, because depending on the compound, the molar masses can be wildly different. For example, pure water has a molar mass of \\~18.02 g/mol. So 1 Kg of water = 55.5 moles of water. But take another common substance; glucose. That has a molar mass of \\~180.2 g/mol - almost exactly 10x more. For the exact same mass of glucose - 1 Kg - you have only 5.55 moles of glucose. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is super-important, because in chemistry, reactions are calculated stoichiometrically, which means the number of starting molecules is used to figure out the expected number of product molecules. Sometimes you need a 1:1 ratio of two reactants to get the desired product, sometimes you need a 3:1 ratio. But that ratio is always with respect to # of molecules, NOT mass. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe mole is the only unit that you can use to reliably &amp; accurately predict the outcome of a chemical reaction.

In fact, I would argue it was an **important** question, and the teacher wasted an opportunity to stress the usage of the mole to the class. \n\nThe mole refers to a number of things, just like a dozen. You can have a dozen eggs, but also you could have a dozen molecules of caffeine. You could have a mole of caffeine, but you also could have a mole of eggs. This is important because chemistry cares more about the *number* of molecules than the weight of those molecules. \n\nFurthermore, consider the following balanced equation: 2(H2) + (O2) -&gt; 2(H2O). Given 2 moles of H2 and excess oxygen, you know you can produce 2 moles of H2O. Using moles allows us to compare the actual quantity of molecules, whereas with weight it would be difficult to compare in such a neat fashion. Given 200g of H2 and excess oxygen, you have to do some annoying math to first convert to moles, then convert back to grams. \n\nMass is, like you noted, more useful because it's easier to measure. You weigh chemicals with mass because it's easier, and because we're capable of converting to moles. That said, it's not uncommon to have percentages which are based on weight. Mass by mass, mass by volume, and volume by volume (m/m, m/v, and v/v respectively) are all common, with the first being solids in solids (e.g. alloys), the second being solids in liquids (e.g. solutions), and the third being liquids in liquids (mixtures and some solutions).

You can convert grams to moles by using the molar mass, and moles to #molecules/#particles by using Avogradro's number. And Avogradro's number was specifically created to make finding the molar mass ridiculously simple (just look at the atomic mass). So, moles are a unit we created to make calculations simplier, and as fonduman said, created so you aren't stuck looking at 52*10^26 molecules and instead looking at about 100 moles.\n\nHope this helped.\n\nEdit: Okay, so after further thought, and seeing mispells1wordallways's answer above, I think the mole is more of a \"psudo unit\".

Maybe you are confusing \"unit\" with \"dimension\", in which case this page explains the difference better than i could: http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~labgroup/pdf/Dimensions_units.htm.\n\n\nFor the fellow lazy redditors:\n\n\n\"It is fairly easy to confuse the physical dimensions of a quantity with the units used to measure the dimension. We usually consider quantities like mass, length, time, and perhaps charge and temperature, as fundamental dimensions. We then express the dimensions of other quantitieslike speed, which is length/time, in terms of the basic set. The point is that every quantity which is not explicitly dimensionless, like a pure number, has characteristic dimensions which are not affected by the way we measure it.\n\nUnits give the magnitude of some dimension relative to an arbitrary standard. For example, when we say that a person is six feet tall, we mean that person is six times as long as an object whose length is defined to be one foot. The standard size chosen is, of course, entirely arbitrary, but becomes very useful for comparing measurements made in different places and times. Several national laboratories are devoted to maintaining sets of standards, and using them to calibrate instruments.\n\nIn contrast to dimensions, of which only a few are needed, there is a multitude of units for measuring most quantities. You have probably heard of lengths measured in inches, feet, miles, meters, centimeters and kilometers, but there are also furlongs, rods, Angstroms, nautical miles, parsecs and many others. It is, therefore, always necessary to attach a unit to the number, as when giving a person\u2019s height as 5 feet 9 inches, or as 175 cm. Without units, a number is at best meaningless and at worst misleading to the reader.\"",

It is now exactly 6.02214076 * 10^23 .  \n\nhttps://www.nist.gov/si-redefinition/redefining-mole\n\nThis broke the relationship between carbon 12, the dalton, the kilogram and Avogadro's number.\n\nThe mass of C 12 is still 12 dalton.  However, the redefinition broke the old relationship between N_A and kg.\n\nhttps://www.bipm.org/utils/en/pdf/si-revised-brochure/Draft-SI-Brochure-2018.pdf\n\n&gt; The numerical value of the Avogadro constant defined in [the previous] way was equal to the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon 12. However, because of recent technological advances, this number is now known with such precision that a simpler and more universal definition of the mole has become possible, namely, by specifying exactly the number of entities in one mole of any substance, thus fixing the numerical value of the Avogadro constant. This has the effect that the new definition of the mole and the value of the Avogadro constant are no longer dependent on the definition of the kilogram. The distinction between the fundamentally different quantities \u2018amount of substance\u2019 and \u2018mass\u2019 is thereby emphasized. The present definition of the mole based on a fixed numerical value for the Avogadro constant, NA, was adopted in Resolution 1 of the 26th CGPM (2018).\n\nSee also the Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_redefinition_of_SI_base_units\n\nThe graphics on the side with New SI and Old SI are quite useful - the mol is its own constant and not derived from the kilogram (and nothing is derived based on it).",

You'd get many less ostrich eggs than regular ones. Same with chemical compounds and elements. They don't weight the same. So you want to define a standard amount of units, the mole, to express effortlessly a standardized number of units, instead of using masses!\n\n\nIn chemistry you are always interested in the number of  elements (element, as in, a single element in a bunch, not as in a chemical element) reacting/interacting, not their mass.

You don\u2019t need to convert back and forth to mass to make that simple observation. \n\nSo it\u2019s not a silly question and there is a simple explanation. ",

            "comment": "Absolutely not a stupid question. Grams are definitely important in the process, but in order to have an accurate ratio of reactants in a reaction, grams needs to be converted into moles. This is due to the fact that molecules have varying weights. For example, say we want to make sugar water with 1 molecule of sugar for every 10 molecules of water:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSugar/Glucose/Fructose is:\n\n6 Carbons \\*  12g/mole = 72g/mole\n\n12 Hydrogens \\* 1g/mole = 12g/mole\n\n6 Oxygens \\* 16 g/mole = 96g/mole\n\nSo 1 mole of sugar = 180g/mole\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWater is:\n\n2 Hydrogens \\* 1g/mole = 2g/mole\n\n1 Oxygens \\* 16g/mole = 16g/mole\n\nSo 1 mole of water = 18g/mole\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo the mass of water and sugar if we wanted to make the 1:10 sugar water mentioned above would be:\n\n10 moles of water = 180g\n\nand 1 mole of sugar = 180g\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHope that makes sense.

To use molecular quantities is the most efficient/largest yield of product - because the main purpose of business - make the most of less. So if you take everything in mass, some of your molecular which were more will be left unreacted and your product will be contaminated with reagents. Also you can write recipe buy masses and you will do when you make something the same and most of the time, but molecular recipe of masses is hard to remember complicated - atoms are light. So instead of calculating by masses we take some quantity of atoms where recipe follows only the smallest of reactive atoms/molecular. So when you know smallest amount how they act, the same will go with 100, 10000 or 6.02e23 which is basically a mole and we can easily figure out each type of atom/molecule mass, because iron atom larger and heavier than oxygen thus their moles weigh differently.\n\nAnd your question is really good, you are reasoning your world and you should do that for anything.

            "comment": "When looking at chemical reactions, which is a big part of the study of chemistry, the reactants and products are usually considered in terms of quantity of atoms/molecules, and not their masses.\n\nFor example, when we consider the burning of hydrogen, we write that two molecules of H2 and one molecule of O2 react to form two molecules of H2O (water). \n\nSimilarly, when we burn one molecule of ethanol, this sort of numeric accounting will tell us the number of carbon dioxide molecules released as we work out the number of atoms/molecules required to balance the reaction.\n\nWe *could* also work in units of mass, because the two are interchangeable, but it would be unpleasant to have to whip out a calculator for every little step when working with chemical equations.\n\nAn analogy is that when you are at a carnival and exchanging tickets for prizes, the carnie will tell you that 20 tickets gets you one stuffed bear. \n\nImagine what a pain it would be if they told you that 8 grams in tickets gets you 4300 grams of stuffed bears. Sure, you could convert units of mass to units of numeric quantity to translate this request into number of tickets and number of bears, but it would be quite annoying to have to look up the units of bears per gram and tickets per gram in order to perform this calculation. \n\nWith chemistry, you\u2019d have to look up moles per gram of each atom, which is a pain. \n\nI hope this makes sense. Imagine a world where basketballs were priced at dollars per gram. You\u2019d still be able to figure out how much money to pay for one whole basketball if you could look up how many grams one basketball weighed, but it would be quite annoying to have to do this for every transaction. Still, the units convert directly, so it would still be possible.\n\nIn other situations, though, we have to convert *back* to units of mass if we care about how much mass of something we need. \n\nFor example, in the lab we have to convert masses of reactants to number of molecules, then use the number of molecules to balance a chemical formula and figure out how many molecules of this other thing I\u2019ll need to match the *molar* ratios, and then convert from moles back to mass to figure out how much I have to weigh out on the scale. \n\nBoth unit systems are useful, we can convert back and forth between them, but moles are very useful when describing number of atoms (\u201cnumber of tickets\u201d) and mass is very useful when you need to know the actual mass of reaction products/reactants (\u201chow many kg of tickets can I physically carry with me?\u201d). \n\n**Summary:** units of moles allow us to convert between *mass* of molecules and *number* of molecules if we multiply by grams per mole, and it is much easier to express and consider chemical reactions (one molecule of A plus one molecule of B gives us two molecules of C and four molecules of D). Much the same way as it\u2019s easier in many cases to specify \u201cone dozen eggs\u201d than \u201c563.78 grams of eggs.\u201d",

            "comment": "I think to understand this really clearly, we have to begin with the question of what, exactly, makes atoms of one element different from another. The answer is that each element is made of a specific number of protons + some number of neutrons and then this nucleus is contained within a cloud of electrons (whose number generally equals the number of protons, at least until chemical reactions are involved). Now, these protons and neutrons have specific mass (so do the electrons but that mass is trivial in comparison.) Thus, the individual atoms of the various elements weigh different amounts. For example, the typical hydrogen has just one proton and no neutrons, so we say it has an atomic mass = 1. Similarly, the oxygen everyone wants to react with the hydrogen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons, which gives it an atomic mass of 16. (Now, we get into some much more advanced theory when we start asking questions about those neutrons and why their numbers can vary. Those are excellent questions, and it turns out that we are still working on those answers!) \n\nNow, with all this background, those other explanations should be easier to understand. If individual atoms are involved in chemical reactions, it's convenient to use a counting unit to describe them. Practically, however, we can't easily count out atoms like we do eggs, so we want to be able to convert that counting unit into something easier to use: grams. That's why we learn to convert moles and mass; the thinking about reactions requires moles, but the practical work of performing reactions requires mass. \n\n(BTW, one final interesting question you might have is about those neutrons. Why do we call any atom with, for example, 6 protons carbon even if it has a different number of neutrons? One variation has 6 neutrons, another has 8, and there are lots of cases like this. Well, it turns out that the chemical properties of elements are pretty much determined by the behavior of the electrons, and the electrons aren't much effected by the number of neutrons. Thus, the chemistry of that carbon with atomic mass 12 and that other *isotope* of carbon with atomic mass 14 are virtually the same, so we consider them to be the same element. They are, however, observably different in some ways!)",

Water is 2 H 1 O so with moles you can say that you need 2 times more hydrogen than oxygen. If you want 5 moles of water it will be 5 moles of oxygen and 10 moles of hydrogen. With grams you can't calculate that easily: oxygen weight 16 grams.moles^-1 and hydrogen 1g.moles^-1 you ll have 16 grams of water and 2 grams of hydrogen to have 2 times more hydrogen than oxygen.\n\nThat is why chemist prefer moles than grams.

Say 1 gram of oxygen has has 50 moles and 1 gram of hydrogen is has 100 moles, and I want to make water (H2O). I can't just add 2 grams of Hydrogen and 1 gram of oxygen. Think about why.\n\n\nFor now lets think of moles as 1 individual MOLEcule (in really theres a shit ton per mole)\n\n\nNow,\n2 grams of Hydrogen = 200 moles\n1 gram of oxygen      = 50 moles\n\nIf I did it like this i could only make 50 moles of H2O with 100 moles of hydrogen left over. Because its a 2:1 \"reaction\" in this scenario. If I wanted to react everything into H2O I would need to start with 100 moles of oxygen (or 2 grams). \n\nIts important to talk about things in moles instead of grams.

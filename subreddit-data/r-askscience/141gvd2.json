            "comment": "Anecdotally, accessing creativity is more about focus than mood. The presence of rumination (I\u2019m a bad artist, people are depending on me and I\u2019m letting them down, etc\u2026) are a distraction from engaging with problem solving and the more focused you are on CONCERNS about your work the less you\u2019re actually connecting with your work.\n\nMost artists don\u2019t understand that this is usually the source of \u201cwriters block.\u201d\n\nYou can be happy, depressed, morose, tired, energetic, in love, etc\u2026 And still access creativity if you have good tools for reframing concerns to relieve internal pressure and expenditure on coping, that surplus energy will increase your creativity since creativity is often about making interesting lateral connections as part of the context of the work. More layers of associations and meaning you can build into the work, the more \u201ccreative\u201d it is. That requires a lot of energy and focus.\n\nOutside that there will be a wide variance in temperament and personality that skews this and also requires different strategies person to person. But fundamentally\u2026 if you\u2019re worrying about life or social safety, these are all barriers to living inside the work instead of living inside your head.\n\nEdit: You might have decent luck searching research on flow states as opposed to \u201chappiness\u201d",

            "comment": "I don't know about any studies but my own experience has been such that I don't think there's any correlation. Plus throw in the the fact that different creative endeavors might need different moods to best influence the creative work. If you're writing something dark and depressing, maybe being in a dark and depressing place if more helpful.\n\nI've also observed a tendency in myself to dive more into creating art and other things (I'm a filmmaker and visual effects artist) when I'm dealing with grief or other difficulty in life. During Covid lockdown and finding myself out of work for a bit, I coded like crazy. I'm actually recently unemployed again and I'm working my ass off on a personal project and writing the next thing I want to make.\n\nOn the flip side, I've also done some of my best work when I was happiest. Sometimes the act of creating itself will bring me out of these periods of depression.",

                    "comment": "Studies do not always say yes or no. Sometimes they show we correlations, sometimes when you see two studies they have opposite effects. Sometimes it depends on how you ask the questions, sometimes findings are based on random luck or the researchers were kind of biased going in and tweak the results to get an answer that they liked. (I hate this but it does happen)\n\nAll too often when asking difficult questions, especially ones that involve not well defined constructs such as happiness and creativity, there's no single answer, there's no consistent relationship, the answer is sort of it depends.",

    "postText": "In other words, how much do sports-specific skills transfer to different but related tasks in the real world?\n\nI have a number of follow up questions too:\n\n- Does it matter _which_ sports you play, or would most vigorous and contact sports more or less accomplish the job?\n\n- Also, how much do specific skills matter? Is throwing skill, as one example, a crucial skill to learn at a young age? Would throwing not only train the muscle groups that throw things but also develop a deep intuition for projectiles and judging distances, which would be hard to learn from other experiences?\n\n- What is it like for an adult to attempt to learn sports skills for the first time?\n\nThese are tricky questions for me to research. It's one thing to learn the biomechanics of the body or a specific technique, but it's another to learn longitudinally how much my learning that is in any way beneficial to me for something other than the sport itself. I guess I've always assumed that there were tons of direct correlation benefits, but I don't actually have an answer to that, and I don't know what studies have been done on this.",

            "comment": "Playing sports as a kid helps much later on in improving coordination, balance, agility, and overall physical fitness. Though I don't have the specifics for your other question since the extent of transfer between sports-specific skills to tasks varies.\n\nI'll try answering your follow-up questions as best as I can so feel free to correct me:\n\n1. Most vigorous and contact sports can contribute to the development of motor control, as they often involve dynamic movements, coordination, and physical exertion. However, different sports may emphasize different aspects of motor control, so participating in a variety of sports can provide a more well-rounded development.\n\n2. Specific skills, such as throwing, can indeed be important to develop at a young age. They not only train the relevant muscle groups but also contribute to the development of hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness, and judgment of distances. Learning these skills through sports and physical activities can provide a unique experiential understanding that may be challenging to acquire through other means.\n\n3. Learning sports skills as an adult can be challenging but also rewarding. It may require more effort and practice compared to learning as a child, but adults can still develop proficiency and enjoy the process of acquiring new skills. So be patient, persistent, and open to learning from mistakes.\n\nThese are only generalisations.",

            "comment": "Playing Sports and participating in a wide variety of physical activity is very important for development of motor control.  But it is less about learning sports specific skills and more about learning a wide variety of motor skills.  \n\n\nFor classification of Motor Skills fundamental motor skills (FMS) are often used. They are not clearly defined but generally consist of locomotion and object control and sometimes posture.  \nStodden et al.  have a paragraph that sums up FMS and their importance for future engagement in sports up pretty well:  \n\"FMS are composed of locomotor skills and object control skills. Locomotor skills involve  \nmoving the body through space and include skills such as running, galloping,  \nskipping, hopping, sliding, and leaping (Haywood &amp; Getchell, 2005). Object  \ncontrol skills consist of manipulating and projecting objects and include skills  \nsuch as throwing, catching, bouncing, kicking, striking, and rolling (Haywood &amp;  \nGetchell, 2005). These skills form the foundation for future movement and physical activity (Clark &amp; Metcalfe, 2002; Seefeldt, 1980). In essence, these FMS are  \nthe equivalent of the ABCs in the world of physical activity. With respect to the  \n\u201cfundamental patterns period\u201d of development, Clark and Metcalfe (2002) stated,  \n\u201cthe overall goal of this period is to build a sufficiently diverse motor repertoire  \nthat will allow for later learning of adaptive, skilled actions that can be flexibly  \ntailored to different and specific movement contexts\u201d (p. 176). If children cannot  \nproficiently run, jump, catch, throw, etc., then they will have limited opportunities  \nfor engagement in physical activities later in their lives because they will not have  \nthe prerequisite skills to be active.\" (https://doi.org/10.1080/00336297.2008.10483582                          )   \n\n\nNot developing FMS in early life by participating in a wide variety of activities might be harmful for later learning of sports specific movement skills. And low self perceived skill in sports is considered to be detrimental to participation in sports.    \n\n\nFor your follow up Questions:  \n1. The specific sport does not matter. What matters is a variety of motor skills being used. A single sport is rarely to never able to teach the needed variety, but a sports program should incorporate different elements and exercises for learning motor skills not directly connected to the specific sport to increase general motor skill proficiency. So participating in most sports should do a good job. But the children should also be active outside of sports.\n\nThe WHO recommendation for children aged 3-4 is \"spend at least 180 minutes in a variety of types of physical activities at any intensity, of which at least 60 minutes is moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, spread throughout the day; more is better;\" ([https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity))  \nAs you get older physical activity becomes less important for motor development and gets more important for health, so a wide variety of activities becomes less important and mainly the time spent active becomes more important. \n\n2. Crucial skills to learn are the FMS, including throwing. \n\n3. How difficult a new sports specific movement is is dependent on how good FMS and similar movement skills are developed. Seefeldt even proposed a hypothesis of a \"proficiency barrier\" in 1980 where a certain proficiency of FMS are needed to break through into sports specific skills and properly develop them. The \"proficiency barrier\" is only a conceptual basis for translation of FMS to sports specific skills and is not empirically tested.",

What's interesting is that it's the rules of the game, which lead to the strategy, which lead to the emphasized fine motor skills and awareness.\n\nWhat I've come up with is that kids should start out with soccer and basketball, then transition to football when and if they are capable. Obviously everyone is different, and getting through this is entire process isn't for everyone, but it is for me (and my kin), so it is interesting trying to retrace the optimal path to get to where I am today. \n\nEven though I credit a lot of my throwing skill to baseball, I figure an equal amount of time spent in touch football could have gotten me to the same place. Either way, both sports offer plenty of opportunity to play catch, to throw from various angles, and to track balls in the air. There are lots of other simple games to play with footballs, like \"three flies up\", \"keep away\", and countless other classics.\n\nI think soccer and basketball train full body coordination from opposite directions. Soccer being from the legs up (where the ball is) and basketball being from the hands down (where the ball is). Football (gridiron) kind of puts these skills together with the need to move well in space (lower body coordination) and to have good ball skills (catching, jumping), plus it adds throwing which is kind of a combination of the two skills of upper and lower body coordination, making it a more advanced skill to have.\n\nFootball also adds the elements of formational awareness and warlike experience (imagine running down on kickoffs into a V of fearless oncoming blockers, possibly weighing more than you), which I think is an important coming-of-age milestone for young men.\n\nRugby essentially accomplishes the same thing as american football, but I think american football integrates a wider variety of skills, whereas rugby has smaller variety in plays and strategy (even though rugby players might individually \"wear more hats\" and be more diverse in skillsets than some football players). They are really quite similar, and even in backyard american football games, what you see is almost literally just rugby with allowed forward passes (ie, you aren't wearing pads in the backyard, but you still might be tackling). Due to the fact that football teaches throwing heavily (especially when you are young and throwing the ball around), I think that makes it a superior sport for youth development.\n\nI also think that by the time you're 18-20, you've already gotten most general benefit from these games that you will ever get. In other words, you can keep getting better at these sports past that point, but it will be primarily about non-transferrable skills rather than general motor skills that would be useful in any other aspect of life. Nothing wrong with loving the sport and continuing down that path (since you said, all physical activity is good), but probably worth keeping in mind that you aren't doing it for anything other than intrinsic benefit.\n\nEdit: I could still see the argument for baseball since swinging a stick/club is kind of a unique movement.",

Soccer players, especially the defense, have far higher risks for neurodegenerative diseases. I do not know the numbers for football but it seems reasonable to me that it is the same there. \n\nBut the best way to go about it is likely finding sports the child likes, including a team sport, and encouraging it to participate there. Then incorporating different sports as part of the regular training like playing a short game of soccer after a general warm up before transitioning to the actual sport.   \nAnd the school should play a big part in acquiring movement skills. Having a well planned session of sports in school where every child participates and tries out different sports and movements multiple times week would likely lead to a majority of children having enough of the FMS to concentrate on a specific sport in their free time.",

I do not know the numbers for football but it seems reasonable to me that it is the same there. \n\nYou're comparing amateurs with professionals who spending many orders of magnitude more time playing these games, as well as against more physically aggressive competition with the capacity to cause said damage.\n\nI won't go into the choices that a pro athlete makes, but I think these sports are more or less safe for kids to play. Will there be injuries? Yes. Will there be things learned and gained? Yes. I think it's a fair tradeoff, and I wouldn't promote a perfectly safe environment for kids to grow up in.\n\n&gt;  And the school should play a big part in acquiring movement skills.

For instance, a kid could play baseball during recess, but is he going to come anywhere close to having the throwing skills of someone who plays baseball in a league? And would the skills developed in said league still be considered \"transferrable\" (developing general FMS) or to the point of being too specific to baseball? It depends on the age of the player, but I think well into the teenage years, the practice in any of the main sports I mentioned would provide additional gains, and practicing all of them separate from school would provide gains exclusive to each of the sports I mentioned.",

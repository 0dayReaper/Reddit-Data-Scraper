Furthermore, natural barriers such as mangrove trees would weaken waves and help protect the coast from things like erosion, storms, and tsunamis.",

This phenomenon occurs when the land sinks, which can be caused by various factors such as intensive underground resource extraction, like gas extraction, or disruptions in the flow of sediments that contribute to the formation of land. Conversely, there are instances where land elevation occurs, as seen in Greenland, where the melting of heavy ice leads to the rising of the land!",

The sides also aren\u2019t at the same level nor do they have the same slope so the same water level won\u2019t have the same effect everywhere\n\nIn a real ocean, the water is constantly moving around. There\u2019s waves on the surface but also currents and tides pushing water away from some areas lowering the water level and towards others raising it.\n\nThe tides aren\u2019t the same across oceans so one side wouldn\u2019t flood at the same time as the other.\nFinally, atmospheric pressure is not the same everywhere and this means that water at different parts of an ocean wouldn\u2019t be the same even if nothing else was going on. Storm events in particular are regions of particularly low pressure so water levels will be higher as the pressure outside the storm presses down on the water and the lower pressure let\u2019s it rise slightly. \n\nThe local areas I know that regularly experience ocean flooding generally only do so, at least significantly, when a king tide (extra high high) is combined with a major low pressure weather event",

            "comment": "Flooding is generally caused by rain.  Rain doesn't fall equally along an entire coast.  Same as with a tsunami,  It's just energy pushing up the sea in a comparatively  local area.  While we think of 'mean sea level' as perdy much constant,  it still takes time for rain to go from on the land to in the ocean.  So when rain falls faster than natural or Engineered water flow pathways can drain, that surrounding area floods.  Flooding is also temporary.  But flooding destroys everything that shouldn't get wet like drywall and plywood.\n\n\nYou may be thinking that since sea level is the same elevation, that flooding should occur everywhere along an oceanic coastline?  \n\nBasically, oceans are big.  Storms and flood events are small in comparison.  By the time it takes the flood water height to drain and even out to the sea level the flood damage is already done.",

People move 2 feet left, ship moves 0.0001 feet right (actual value based on the proportional difference in mass.\n\nSo, overall, the [orbiting mass] does not change orbit, even if the position of some little bits within that mass shift around. At least, in this case.",

Conservation of momentum is in effect, the station compensates for the change in mass distance by moving faster.\n\nAlso can argue that simply by pushing off the wall of the station in order to move to the earth side of it keeps the orbit in the same place.",

Just like an SUV might tip over if you corner too fast because it has a higher center of gravity, and thus is more likely to tip when appropriate force is applied. It doesn't necessarily mean that it will affect the orbit of the station",

It doesn't matter how much mass you have if everything is in the same orbit.\n\nNew modules affect the drag and more mass means you need more fuel for orbit change maneuvers, but these are smaller effects.",

            "comment": "No. An understanding of inertial frames helps to grok why this is not the case. You and the ship are moving within the same frame, which means you are always moving not relative to the orbit, but relative to the ship. If you push against the side of the ship, the ship is gonna push back just as hard. This also implies that with respect to anything outside of the ship, the weight remains constant despite minuscule changes in the center of gravity. To change the orbit, the ship must act externally upon the force exerted by the planet, usually by firing a rocket or venting gas.\n\nPlease correct anything I got wrong here, it's been years since I studied physics.",

They're sold as cooling your whiskey without diluting it, and that's kind of true in that it dilutes it more slowly, but by diluting it more slowly it also cools it more slowly, meaning the whiskey is warmer while you're drinking it. On top of that many whiskey experts suggest a splash of water in your whiskey to begin with.\n\nThe important thing here is that the heat of enthalpy of water/ice is huge compared to the heat capacity of either liquid water or ice. Ice cools *by melting*!",

You want the whiskey cooled, but not ice cold.  You can always speed up the cooling if you want by swirling and increasing the convection rate.",

The specific heat of whiskey is similar to that of ice, so if you have a glass that is 2/3 ice at say -30C, and 1/3 whiskey you should get significant cooling without dilution.",

However, the soup would likely be cooler after the ice cube melted, than the soup after the shaved pieces melted, because more time would pass by then, so the soup would lose more heat to the surrounding area, to the air and through the bowl over that greater period of time. But that is including the effects of heat radiating into and out of the bowl and directly into the air over that greater period of time, and is not just a change in temperature from the ice cube.",

            "comment": "This is slightly ambiguously worded, so I will address the wording in answering the question.\n\nThere are two ways to read what you're asking depending on how you interpret \"cooling more\". Normally, people would use cooling \"more\" to describe a lower equilibrium temperature (more change in temperature units regardless of time), and cooling \"faster\" to denote a greater rate of cooling (more change in temp per unit of time)\n\n1. \"What are the relationship between \\*rates of cooling\\* of shaved and block ice with an identical mass and temperature?\"\n2. \"What are the equilibrium temperatures of the soup + shaved ice system and the soup + block ice system?\"\n\nThe answer to question 1 is that the rate of cooling of the shaved ice will be greater than that of the block ice. This is due to the greater surface area of the shaved ice leading to more interactions per time. These interactions dictate the cooling effect on the soup, so more -&gt; faster cooling rate.\n\nTo answer question 2, if the two samples of ice are identical mass and temperature (and composition), they will both have the same \"heat capacity\" and the total amount of cooling they both provide will be the same. Even though the block ice will take longer, when it finally finishes the soup will be the same temperature as that with the shaved ice added.",

I dunno.",

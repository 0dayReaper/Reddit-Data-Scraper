Does that mean anything? Does it imply that another one can occur in the next let's say, 1-2 years? or does it mean that it wont ever again?\n\nFirst off, if we take a look at (geologically) recent history of the orientation of the magnetic field e.g. [this diagram for the last 5 million years where black bars indicate a 'normal' field oriented like today, and white bars indicate a 'reversed' field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Geomagnetic_polarity_late_Cenozoic.svg) or a [similar diagram going back 170 million years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal#/media/File:Geomagnetic_polarity_0-169_Ma.svg), we can see that the changes in the orientation of the magnetic field are definitely not periodic (e.g. the Cretaceous superchron normal period which lasted upwards of 40 million years). So, the premise that we are somehow overdue for a reversal is not really viable and similarly, nothing about the field at present suggests that it is in a fundamentally different state, i.e., we still expect a reversal will occur eventually. We would only expect magnetic field reversals to cease if the magnetic field itself completely collapses as field reversals appear to be intrinsic parts of geodynamos (i.e., the mechanism generating the magnetic field - see [this past discussion on AskScience](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3ddmyk/according_to_the_theory_earths_magnetic_poles/)).\n\n&gt; Also, is there any way to predict the next one?\n\nNot really. If you look through some of the links and/or discussion in the old linked thread, you'll find that generally this is a chaotic process and not easily predictable beyond saying that it will reverse at some point. From records of past reversals preserved in the remnant magnetic field within rocks, we know that reversals are preceded by periods of decaying magnetic field strength, and specifically the strength of the \"dipole\" component of the field. Given the observation that this dipole component has been [decreasing for ~300 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_magnetic_field#/media/File:Geomagnetic_axial_dipole_strength.svg), there have been some suggestions that we might be approaching a reversal (e.g., [another old AskScience thread discussing this](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4b5zjt/by_how_much_is_the_earths_magnetic_field_decaying/)). However, at this point, the decrease could still be a [geomagnetic excursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_excursion) and we basically won't know until the field intensity decreases below a certain threshold (see the linked discussion for more details). Effectively, the jury is still out on whether we are really approaching a reversal (as opposed to an excursion), e.g., the [official position of the USGS is that we are not approaching a reversal](https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/are-we-about-have-a-magnetic-reversal), which really just reflects that we can't know until it's basically already happening and there's no meaningful way to forecast when it will happen.",

Turns out we had one about 30kya and there were at least two others around the same time. My sources were USGS, so focused on the US. \n\nAll to say that this makes me curious if there were more across the world.\n\n*staggering this way and that. Long Valley Caldera, Mono Lake,  Yosemite\u2026\n\nEdit: Oh, I guess the Mono Lake, Laschamp &amp; east coast excursions are considered separate / distinct events? Man, there's always more to learn. Which is good. Not so good, I tend to overreach with what I have learned so far.",

The majority of studies of geodynamos is typically concerned with Earths dynamo while the term geodynamo is applied to at least all terrestrial planets. As such these models seek to feature reversals in order to be \"Earth-like\", rather than this being an emergent property of all dynamos. It is possible in principle to get non-oscillatory dynamos we just do not know if they exist in nature. The only oscillatory dynamos we know of in the Solar system are that of Earth, with infrequent pseudo-random reversals, and the Sun with a highly regular 22 year reversal period.",

            "comment": "To add to the other answers. Geomagnetic reversals are not instant. Most estimates of the timeframe are 100 to 10,000 years, though there is some suggestion of more rapid change, but you're not going to go wake up one morning and find your compass pointing the wrong way. During a reversal there could be multiple magnetic north and south poles on the surface, wandering nowhere near the geographic poles.\n\nhttps://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2010GL044286",

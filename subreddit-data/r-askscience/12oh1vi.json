Reptiles tend to gorge and digest over time, and don\u2019t actually eat that much (a large mammal could keep an anaconda well fed for months).\n\nIf you want your dragons to be active, high metabolism killing machines, then increase this rough metabolism to fit, but a sheep/cow a day would still be an obscene amount of calories for any animal, so it wouldn\u2019t even be that much I don\u2019t think.\n\nMaybe see if you can research any prehistoric animals like [Argentavis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentavis) (basically a 7m wingspan giant eagle that lived around 3-24 million years ago. If you can find *any* info about it\u2019s estimated daily intake requirements, that would be a start :)",

When there was more CO2 in the atmosphere, plants (who breathe in and build themselves out of CO2) grew faster. This meant that there was more to eat for herbivores. You could probably tie that in to current events *somehow*.",

The other most productive soils come from volcanic ash where there are regular but smaller quantities of ash produced, similar to the Serengeti. Volcanoes need to be active enough to have constant small ash plumes but not massive eruptions that smother everything in deep ash.",

Because the island was once an ecosystem itself as coral reef, before rising above sea level thousands of years before it\u2019s first inhabitants, the land provides just about everything for everyone. Including sea life. Even though it is risen well above sea level, the land itself is still connected to its origin of coral. This very coral acts as a barrier protecting the land from the unwanted (Including James Cook!)\n\nPrecious part of the world because it\u2019s a natural and self sustaining fort with the ocean for a moat lol",

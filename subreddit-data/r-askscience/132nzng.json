            "comment": "A less know contributor of the lung cancer risk from smoking tobacco stems from Polonium-210 and Uranium-decay products present in the soil. Tobacco is a known accumulator of these elements, resulting in enhaced levels of radioactive elements in the smoke you inhale. Polonium-210 emits alpha-radiation, which is, introduced directly in your tissue/body, quite harmful.\n\n&gt;For example, one study found that a person smoking two packs a day is exposed to about 5 times as much polonium as a non-smoker but specific parts of their lungs could be exposed to hundreds of times more radiation. Another study estimated that smoking a pack-and-a-half every day exposes a smoker to a dose of radiation equivalent to 300 chest X-rays a year.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Do these doses lead to lung cancer? It\u2019s hard to say, especially since the effects of polonium are only part of a wider range of damaging consequences caused by inhaling cigarette smoke. But animal studies certainly give us cause for concern.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Absorbed doses of radiation can be measured using units called rads, and experiments have shown that as little as 15 rads of polonium can induce lung cancers in mice. That\u2019s only about a fifth of what a smoker would get if they averaged 2 packs a day for 25 years. Indeed, the lung tissues of smokers who have died of lung cancer have absorbed about 80-100 rads of radiation.

If people were taking a break every 20 minutes to smoke a joint for consecutive decades of their lives, then I would expect that they would be at a greater risk of cancers.\n\n/u/chaedog also mentioned that there's not nearly as much evidence to support the link between cannabis smoking and cancer as there is with tobacco, which I think is a good point.",

So you get carcinogens from the combustion itself and you inhale the carcinogens found naturally in the plant itself. This is why people who chew tobacco have a higher risk of oral cancers. The chemical carcinogens from the chewed tobacco go into the surrounding tissues. Weed to my knowledge does not have carcinogens in the plant itself. This is true for other things people smoke like lettuce and some herbal cigarettes, the plant material itself does not have carcinogens in it. But note that combusting anything and inhaling creates carcinogens in that process, it just has less compared to tobacco.",

Though there\u2019s not been a lot of research, it may be better to use edibles. So far it\u2019s been difficult to study cannabis as a carcinogen because alot of people who smoke cannabis also  smoke cigarettes. A study would have to be based on people who only smoke cannabis, basically, in the best scenario. Unfortunately, I believe that cannabis contributes to lung cancer as well. I know people who have quit smoking cigarettes a decade or so ago but continue to smoke cannabis, they went on to develop lung cancer anyway . However, you can still develop cancer long after quitting smoking. And some cigarettes are thought to have a lot of additional additives and cannabis is thought to be free of those additional additives as it does not go through the processes that the cigarette companies put tobacco through. Each brand of cigarettes has different tar ratings. I personally don\u2019t know if they use pesticides when growing tobacco, which is a legitimate very valid question. I\u2019ve had two friends that smoked a lot of cannabis recently pass away from lung cancer. However, they both smoke cigarettes. One had quit smoking cigarettes a decade before, however, , you can still develop lung cancer after you have quit for a long period of time. Despite my history with cannabis myself, I do believe it is a contributor to lung disease. Which is not in anyway meaning they need to regulate cannabis or take over. Also, I guess filters can also be carcinogenic themselves.",

And the addictiveness is largely irrelevant, in fact the nicotine (that you become addicted to) is relatively harmless in the kind of doses even a heavy smoker takes in. It\u2019s the delivery mechanism, the 7000-odd chemicals ADDED to the nicotine. Whilst relatively harmless nicotine\u2019s real danger comes from the fact that it is one of the most addictive substances known - and at least as addictive as heroin according to some studies. Which means you\u2019ll keep smoking and keep taking in the cyanide, polonium, arsenic, benzene etc etc. \n\nThere is no such thing as a safe or healthy way to smoke.\n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the reason there are more incidents of lung cancer amongst tobacco smokers vs weed smokers is that many, many more people smoke tobacco than weed, and most weed smokers will also smoke tobacco. The number of \u2018weed only\u2019 smokers is tiny by comparison, probably too few to even provide a reliable sample data size.",

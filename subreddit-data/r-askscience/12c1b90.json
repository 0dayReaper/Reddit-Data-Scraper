Claude Monet was particularly frustrated &amp; upset by this, and, because he tended to paint the same subjects more than once, he ended up documenting his shift in color perception by painting the same thing in blue &amp; green one year and red &amp; yellow a later year. After getting cataract surgery, he was embarrassed by how wrong his more recent pre-surgery paintings had been and started destroying or \"retouching\" any that he could still get his hands on.",

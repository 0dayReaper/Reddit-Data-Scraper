            "comment": "It all comes down to the long range order of magnetic spin. Because these are alloys, it\u2019s difficult to identify the short-range structure giving rise to the long range order. There are multiple types of magnetism. In this case the materials are likely ferrimagnetic where some amount of spin is cancelled out by nearby spin. Imagine if you had a local structure of 10 atoms with net \u201cup-spin\u201d of 10 if that structure is next to a local structure of 10 atoms with \u201cdown-spin\u201d of 5, then the average magnetism would be the same as a ferromagnet with a net spin of 5 for those 20 atoms.\n\nBecause of the challenge in identifying the local structures, it is difficult to identify the reason for the trend in these alloys.",

It seems that pure cobalt (front left) has the lowest magnetism, and those two peaks on the right represent differing alloys of iron and nickel. Do I have the right of it? And I would assume that a composite of the two would not have similar properties as the alloy.",

            "comment": "For pure iron, it comes down to the underlying crystal structure.\n\nIn a cubic close-packed lattice, also known as face-centred cubic, all electrons of the iron are involved in strong metallic bonding. This means all electrons in the outer shells are strongly delocalised and can move about quite easily and are not prone to form any magnetic order. This allotrope of iron is called austenite, and it is paramagnetic.\n\nIn a body-centred lattice, instead, the d_x^2-y^2 d_z^2 orbitals don't point at a nearest-neighbour atom. This means that they are much less involved in the metallic bonding, instead they are fairly localised and have strong magnetic interactions. This allotrope is called ferrite, and it is ferromagnetic.\n\nFor pure iron, ferrite is stable below 900 C, and austenite is stable between 900 \u2013 1400 C, but adding nickel can make austenite stable at room temperature. I guess this explains the minimum in permeability between iron and nickel in your diagram.",

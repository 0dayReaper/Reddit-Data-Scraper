            "comment": "A lot of the major points here are covered in this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/crust_recycling/), but the highlights are that the behavior of the two types of crust and lithosphere, i.e., oceanic vs continental, are fundamentally different. Mean residence time for oceanic lithosphere is (geologically) short, somewhere around 200-300 million years. In contrast, continental lithosphere has significantly longer residence times and we don't think about it recycling completely in the same way. As discussed in the FAQ, there are mechanisms by which both new continental crust/lithosphere is generated and portions of continental crust are recycled back into the mantle, but in the context of the question, the important aspect is *where* this happening. \n\nSpecifically, both new continental crust formation and continental crust removal preferentially happen along and near the edges of tectonic plates. The large [cratonic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craton) interiors of continental portions of plates are broadly considered to have reached a thickness/temperature/composition that is relatively stable in the sense that there are not processes we would expect to significantly alter them at this point. While the basement of these cratonic sections predate much of the history of life, sediments deposited ontop of them (inlcuding those that would record at least some history of multicellular life on Earth) are also more likely to remain \"unrecycled\". \n\nTo fully answer the question though requires a fair bit of speculation, i.e., effectively, is there a possibility that all extant cratons could be completely recycled back into the mantle? With some big caveats, there's not really a compelling reason to think that at this point, assuming tectonics continues to work broadly in the same way, that all cratons could be destroyed. Now, there are mechanisms where cratonic sections of lithosphere can be converted to something more like normal continental crust (e.g., [Liu et al., 2018a](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2017JB015372)), but even in the cases where this has appeared to happen, (1) it's limited to small sections of cratonic lithopshere and (2) it's not as though the remaining portions of continental lithopshere that use to be the craton are completely recycled, and in fact most of the changes reflect things happening to the mantle portion of the craton, not the crustal portion (e.g., [Liu et al., 2018b](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2017JB015374)).",

                    "comment": "&gt; Another aspect to consider is how long plate tectonics will last on earth. Recent studies by [Wolf and Toon \\(2014\\)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2013GL058376) and [Cheng \\(2018\\)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1342937X18302041), suggest that this is roughly 1.5 billion years. Earth is expected to be enveloped by the Sun in ~5 billion years. So it seems plate tectonics will stop long before earth no longer exists. So even if there were efficient ways of recycling cationic material, it's on a limited timescale to accomplish that.",

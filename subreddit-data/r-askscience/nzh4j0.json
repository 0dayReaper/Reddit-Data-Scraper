            "comment": "This is a large part of the Fermi Paradox. The galaxy is only about 100,000 light years across, so even at 1% of the speed of light, it takes 10 million years to cross the galaxy. We evolved from small mammals to tool-using humans with space rockets over less than 100 million years. The invention of writing to the Apollo Program is maybe 10,000 years or less. All of these time-scales are much shorter than the age of the Earth, let alone the universe. This means that if life intelligent evolved anywhere else within the galaxy, it's unlikely that it appeared at the same time as us - it's almost certain that any intelligent life would be millions of years more advanced or millions of years less advanced.\n\nThis tells us that galaxy-colonising advanced life must be rare, as if there is intelligent life that has the capability and intent to colonise the galaxy, anywhere within the galaxy, anywhere in the past X million or billion years, they should have reached Earth a very long time ago.\n\nOf course, there are multiple reasons why galaxy-colonising advanced life might be rare.\n\n- they lack the intent, i.e. they could colonise the galaxy, but they choose not to leave their home planet, or they do explore the galaxy but leave us alone (basically the Zoo hypothesis)\n\n- they lack the ability, i.e. even with millions of years of advancement it's not practical to leave a solar system in mass migrations, or a more advanced society generally becomes more at risk of destroying itself before it reaches that stage (\"the great filter\")\n\n- *intelligent* life is rare. Life has thrived on Earth for billions of years before one species developed spaceflight. Evolution doesn't inevitably lead towards developing life that can invent advanced technology. There may be many planets out there full of animals and plants, or even just bacteria, but it's possible that humanity is a bit of a freak accident.\n\n- life is rare in general. We don't really know how common life is. We know the ingredients seem to be fairly abundant, but how often do these combine to make something we would reasonably call \"life\"?\n\n- the conditions for life are rare. However, as we discover more and more exoplanets, it looks like there are quite a few planets that seem like they would be hospitable to life, so this is less of a factor than we used to think.\n\nSo this isn't really a \"paradox\" in the common sense, because there are many ways to resolve it. But each of the resolutions involves stuff we just don't know - we don't know how frequently life evolves in the right conditions, we don't know how frequently life evolves to form intelligent space-faring species, and we don't know how often a space-faring space faring species would have the intent and capability to explore the galaxy. Any of these are plausible, and it could easily be a combination of everything.",

Self-replicating chemicals becoming common in places that don't physically forbid them seems.. like an almost inevitable conclusion?\n\nbut there have been SO MANY SPECIES on Earth and only one small genus ever developed metallurgy. To invent electronics and radio transmitters and the like, you need a (highly?) social species that is capable of complex communication to share technological information from generation to generation. Probably needs to be eusocial to have group size big enough to allow for sufficiently high rate of technological progress. I'm guessing the life would have to be on land, because I don't see how you could invent metallurgy under water, but that may be a lack of imagination on my part.   \n\n\nThere's no reason for something like humans to evolve. We're not necessary or inevitable. Earth made lots of weird and cool life before us and probably will continue to do so after us. Animals can be very smart (corvids! cephalopods! cetaceans! other great apes!) and extremely successful without ever picking up a soldering iron or blueprinting a factory.",

There's a book on the Fermi paradox by a SETI researcher that I can't remember the name of, but part of the point is that there's probably not a single bottleneck, but about 8 or so, this being one of them, and we've passed them all in sort of an evenly-spaced out manner over a few billion years, which is actually about what you'd expect when you model out that sort of thing.

If Earth had not been hit by a comet that extinguished all larger life forms (\\~66 Million years ago), it's pretty safe to assume that there'd be no humans or intelligent life in general because the existing species were so dominant and occupied all the available living environment. After all, dinosaurs roamed the planet for 10 times that duration and didn't develop human-like intelligence.\n\nAlso, such super-events must be far spread out and the environment must be relatively stable for a long time. It takes a lot of time after such a \"reset\" to develop intelligent life. A planet that is hit by a comet every 10 million years or so will never have intelligent life even if it seems to be very life-friendly from afar.\n\nThis is of course assuming that intelligent life needs to develop above ground and needs to have a certain size, but given that brain size correlates with intelligence this is probably also a safe assumption.\n\nIf you add all those obstacles up, it might be that it is quite rare for a planet like Earth to exist. But this doesn't mean that we're \"super lucky\" to live on exactly this planet, we are it's product.",

They may move very slowly across the galactic arm, creating very specific and efficient Dyson Spheres as they terraform each rocky ball in their local space, being happy (however that concept works for their biology) with whatever ends they reach. \n\n2. Technology : maybe there really is a light speed barrier, and traveling between stars is just too hard for specific species.

Given the timescales involved in traveling to other stars, and the dubiousness of things like FTL or \"coldsleep\", the most likely method of interstellar colonization is probably something like a generation ship. That's a colossal amount of resources to spend on something that no living person will ever see the end of, or even know if it succeeded. Given the selective pressures of evolution, it seems likely that intelligent species would probably, like humans, have a fairly strong self-interest. It seems damn near impossible to get people to put the health of our own environment above their own profits, so the likelihood of investing so many resources into something that provides no benefit to any living member of the species may just be a hard sell to most civilizations.",

No promises it will ever escape Earth orbit though, as under these conditions, there's going to be earth shattering levels of hatred, spite, and desperation going around.",

Then, we hit a tipping point, and our species took off. \n\nIf we had 10 other earths to study we might understand how intelligence plays into evolutionary processes we might find on other planets and what the odds of human-level crazy intelligence is, but with sample size of N=1 for every event we\u2019re a little out of our depth on that",

Pop III stars formed and died well within the first billion years of the universe. The peak star formation rate is when the universe was only 3 billion years old. Production of new stars and heavy elements has been continually *decreasing* over the past 10 billion years. The universe is changing at a slower and slower rate.\n\nIn particular, the state of the Galaxy has not really changed much over the past billion years. The odds of intelligent life appearing does not change by much if you shift the timescales by one billion years.\n\nSo the odds of intelligent life appearing right now should be about the same as the odds of intelligent life appearing a billion years ago. If it only happened once in the past billion years, that means it's rare.",

We don't need to \"get on a rocket\", but *become* one.\n\nSo, that would be a real paradox right there: stop being \"life forms\" in order to become a spacefaring \"species\".",

We're already at the point where the vast majority of the population is more easily satisfied with a CG rendered fantasy planet than the dry dull reality of Mars, if they even care about either of those more than a tasty burger.\n\nAnd there's good reason to believe this is the norm throughout the galaxy, not a human weakness. One thing all intelligent life has in common is that it evolved from simpler more \"animalistic\" lifeforms. It may well be the case that lifeforms always invent the ability to cocoon themselves in stimulation chambers (eg. VR gaming) such that by the time offworld life is technically possible, it's just all too boring to bother with.\n\nNot the most uplifting solution to the paradox of course.",

They operate as utility maximizers. They don't contact eachother for friendship or whatever or to further understanding, and any information given away is information traded for no utility and puts them at risk.\n\nThis then also terrorizes conscious life into radio silence because of the conclusion the book reaches, that two conscious intelligent lifeforms communicating information to eachother is perceived by non-conscious intelligence as a spam attack designed to waste their resources, because it is totally incoherent to them.\n\n(Quote)\n\n--------\nImagine you are a Scrambler.\n\nImagine you have intellect but no insight, agendas but no awareness. Your circuitry hums with strategies for survival and persistence, flexible, intelligent, even technological\u2014but no other circuitry monitors it. You can think of anything, yet are conscious of nothing.\n\nYou can't imagine such a being, can you? The term being doesn't even seem to apply, in some fundamental way you can't quite put your finger on.\n\nTry.\n\nImagine that you encounter a signal. It is structured, and dense with information. It meets all the criteria of an intelligent transmission. Evolution and experience offer a variety of paths to follow, branch-points in the flowcharts that handle such input. Sometimes these signals come from conspecifics who have useful information to share, whose lives you'll defend according to the rules of kin selection. Sometimes they come from competitors or predators or other inimical entities that must be avoided or destroyed; in those cases, the information may prove of significant tactical value. Some signals may even arise from entities which, while not kin, can still serve as allies or symbionts in mutually beneficial pursuits. You can derive appropriate responses for any of these eventualities, and many others.\n\nYou decode the signals, and stumble:\n\nI had a great time. I really enjoyed him. Even if he cost twice as much as any other hooker in the dome\u2014\n\nTo fully appreciate Kesey's Quartet\u2014\n\nThey hate us for our freedom\u2014\n\nPay attention, now\u2014\n\nUnderstand.\n\nThere are no meaningful translations for these terms. They are needlessly recursive. They contain no usable intelligence, yet they are structured intelligently; there is no chance they could have arisen by chance.\n\nThe only explanation is that something has coded nonsense in a way that poses as a useful message; only after wasting time and effort does the deception becomes apparent. The signal functions to consume the resources of a recipient for zero payoff and reduced fitness. The signal is a virus.\n\nViruses do not arise from kin, symbionts, or other allies.\n\nThe signal is an attack.\n\nAnd it's coming from right over... *there*.\n\n....\n\n\"Now you get it,\" Sascha said.\n\nI shook my head, trying to wrap it around that insane, impossible conclusion. \"They're not even hostile.\" Not even capable of hostility. Just so profoundly alien that they couldn't help but treat human language itself as a form of combat.\n\nHow do you say We come in peace when the very words are an act of war?\n\n\"That's why they won't talk to us,\" I realized.",

Since dark energy is pushing things further and further apart, the longer time goes on the more and more galaxies will be inaccessible to us forever and any intelligent life in it. Forbes did an [article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ethansiegel/2015/06/08/dark-energy-renders-97-of-the-galaxies-in-our-observable-universe-permanently-unreachable/?sh=f80765983193) where they say 97% of the galaxies IN our observable universe are inaccessible to use even if we left today at the speed of light. This greatly reduces the amount of volume a potential intelligent civilization would be able to exist in and still be able to interact with. So for all we know there is life out there.. somewhere.. we'd just never be able to know.\n\nSo to recap, take the entire diameter of the universe estimated at 93 billion light-years. Then the observable universe 46.5 billion light-years. Then about 3% of that. That's what we're able to interact with.",

One planet's worth of life per galaxy on average? That could be 2 trillion alien civilizations. Sounds like a lot. On a universal scale if that were the case I'd say life is pretty common.\n\nWell the closest galaxy to us is 25,000 light years away. So if life in that galaxy took off headed for us 25,000 years ago and somehow traveled at the maximum speed physically possible (a speed we can't even get close to and won't for a very long time), they would just be arriving today.\n\nThis speed limits communication too. So to be more realistic, they would have had to pick up their intergalactic cell phone and dial our number 25,000 years ago, and we'd just hear it ring now. And they wouldn't get our response for another 25,000 years. And that's just the *nearest* galaxy.\n\nThe span of recorded history is 5,000 years total.\n\n&gt;25,000 years ago: a hamlet consisting of huts built of rocks and of mammoth bones is founded in what is now Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice in Moravia in the Czech Republic.

The time it takes for humans to evolve from the oldest human permanent settlement ever found to 27,000AD (if we're even still around), is the same time it would take for a single round trip lightspeed communication with the nearest galaxy.",

            "comment": "~~Some people mention Fermi's Paradox, but that tends to waive most issues with space travel with an \"assume technology is sufficient to overcome challenges\" argument.~~ Correction, the below is technically still part of Fermis argument, still worth the breakdown to get the idea of scale we're talking about.\n\nWatch [this video by Cody'sLab](https://youtu.be/dCSIXLIzhzk) to get the idea of just how incredibly mindbogglingly vast the interstellar expanse really is. That's just the nearest star to us, Proxima Centauri. There are approximately 100-400 billion stars in our galaxy.\n\nYou know how it takes you ~10-14 hours to fly from one end of the earth to the opposite side in a commercial jet airliner? If you flew to the sun at that speed, it would take you 21 years. Light, the upper limit of how fast things can go, takes ~8 minutes, and \"running\" around the earth at that speed would let you encircle our planet ~7.5 times **each second**. That's roughly how fast electromagnetic radiation (for example, radio waves) travel through vacuum of space.\n\n[Here's a picture of how far human radio signals have traveled over the last 100 years.](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/02/27/article-0-11EF84AB000005DC-804_1024x615_large.jpg) From center of that dot, to the edge.\n\nTaking this into consideration, think about the logistics of the space travel and communication:\n\n- You need to know where to go. Mapping planets is extremely difficult, as they are very small and produce no light of their own. Identifying which planets can support life, possibly without terraforming (which is also a process that could take decades) is like trying to figure out whether an apple on a table 2 miles away is edible or rotten while you're wearing a blindfold. But let's assume the aliens are just so damn advanced, they mapped the whole galaxy for planets. They now have to...\n\n- Produce a colony ship/an Ark that can travel for millions of years self sufficiently, effectively creating a space habitat, that can travel at, let's say, 1% the speed of light (that's ~2,990 km per SECOND) and doesn't get blasted to smithereens after any potential collisions with small, undetectable celestial bodies. We can assume that a sufficiently advanced AI will be able to permanently monitor the direction of travel and automatically slow down then adjust the course of the Ark if it notices a planetoid on a collision course. But an asteroid the size of a city or smaller? It likely wont obstruct enough stellar background for any AI to notice (and space is very dark, so you wont just conventionally see it), while slowing down from/adjusting course at 2,990 km/s in a vacuum of space is challenging to say the least. But let's say all the above are solved with the ingenuity of science and technology. We're finally hitting the last step of the problem...\n\n- The people. Assuming the aliums are space elves and live 10,000 years each, assuming 1M years travel time, that's still 100 generations between the start of the journey and the end. Communications between the colony ark and the point of origin are pretty much out of the question - at a mid point in the journey, it takes 5,000 years for a message to travel one way from the ark to their planet alone. So you have people living and dying on this ark, for 100 generations, each of them living ten thousand years, all having to be educated, indoctrinated and somehow controlled to maintain the mission. Unless they're of a gestalt consciousness that transcends spacetime, or have zero capacity for rebellion and self expression, this likely wont end well long term. So the only option is cryogenics which allow you to freeze your colonists for one million years before they reach their destination.\n\nI think recent human history, Hollywood and games seriously skewed people's idea of just how ridiculously hard the above would be in reality. It's not impossible, but that's a lot of technological hurdles and unknown variables to overcome. It's similar when talking about structures like Dyson Sphere. Talking about them requires taking a gigantic leap of faith that involves the logistics of the whole operation, but when you think about gathering and transporting materials alone, it starts feeling quite silly. \n\nAlso, it all needs to pay off - any civilization advanced enough to produce this level of tech likely also has some degree of economy and whoever builds the ark needs both funds and a reason to undertake such colossal task. Even if you assume an idealistic space empire or an absurdly rich and powerful technocrat, that's yet another hurdle in this endeavor. \n\nNow, you could simply wave your hand and say \"they probably would have warp/wormhole travel/instant teleportation tech by then\", but at this stage it's just making things up and anything goes.\n\nEdit: a typo and numbers correction",

This takes the most advanced technology and the longest time. Right now we can't do it, so we'd have to be the ones getting visited\n* Alien technology travels to another inhabited planet. Something like Von Neumann machines make this much more likely because they can spread out as they travel, covering much more area\n* Alien signals reach another inhabited planet, where they can be recognized. This is far and away the easiest, to the point where we might have done it already and not know it yet. (Although over very large distances Von Neumann machines are more reliable, they could for example travel around the galactic core)\n\nThe fact that we don't detect any signs of intelligent life in any form of electromagnetic signals makes it seem like there's no one in our \"neighborhood\" sending anything. If there was, and they were capable of either of the other two options, they'd probably send a message first?\n\nThe lack of messages means either:\n\n* They're not there. Either they never evolved or they died out\n* They're so unlike us that we don't recognize their signals, or they're using something besides electromagnetic. Which might mean we might not even recognize them as \"life\" or intelligent if we saw them\n* They don't want to contact anyone, or they don't want to contact us.\n\n\nTo me, all of our observations fit with the \"Earth evolved intelligent life very early\" scenario. And since we only have one observation, it's very easy that our statistical estimates of how common intelligent life should be to be off by nanny orders of magnitude. \n\nFor example, Earth has had 6 mass extinctions (not counting the one humans are causing now), each of which wiped out most life, but not quite all life. That seems like a pretty unlikely string of bad or good luck (depending on your perspective). It could be that our kind of intelligent life can't evolve without a few major shakeups in the evolutionary landscape. Like, dinosaurs were around for fast longer than hominids, but apparently never came close to the kind of basic intelligence we developed fairly \"quickly\".\n\nIt seems quite possible for there to be lots of ways for life to be very successful, but very few ways for life to be successful and intelligent. And the only way to get out of a gravity well, or send signals across the galaxy is to be intelligent.",

For instance all living beings on Earth are descendants of a unique ancestor commonly referred to as the \"last universal common ancestor\" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common\\_descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_descent)), for instance [the genetic difference between humans and chimpanzees is less than 2%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_evolutionary_genetics)\n\nThis life you mention for all we know could be so vastly different from organisms on Earth that they would be incomprehensible to us. We assume these beings would have something akin to a biological body, with a \"tip\" for a head and means of movement like legs and so on. We assume their means of travel would abide to our CURRENT understanding of means of travel ie. propulsion and that their understanding of physics would be the same as ours, when ours changes constantly.\n\nOther forms of life could take the form of [bionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionics) systems, the symbiosis of digital and biological parts that would be indistinguishable from each other. Current human evolution seems to be taking a [transhumanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) trend, sci-fi stuff like \"enhancements\" and so on, for example for a species studying us, our cellphones could very well be considered an extension of ourselves, giving us the vast knowledge of the internet in seconds. Now imagine a complete symbiosis with this knowledge database, via say [Brain-machine interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface), giving this person immediate access to all human knowledge seamlessly.\n\nThis stuff sounds like sci-fi but it's all progress that could be adapted in less than a decade for humans.\n\nMost of our search for life elsewhere assumes life conditions being the same as here on Earth (understandably, we can't search for complete random conditions for the sake of it). It is assumed other lifeforms should be carbon-based, but we know [biochemistry can theoretically take other forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_types_of_biochemistry) and depend on other solvents besides water. On Earth there a few multicellular organisms that are completely non-dependant on oxygen ([https://phys.org/news/2010-04-scientists-multicellular-life-doesnt-oxygen.html](https://phys.org/news/2010-04-scientists-multicellular-life-doesnt-oxygen.html)).\n\nAt this point, the question arises: what could even be considered life? There are advancements in so-called [Strong AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) and [artificial consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness), so this \"life\" could even be non-biological (so called \"[non-cellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cellular_life)\") or non-corporeal for that matter. (By non-corporeal meaning not interacting with our percieved dimensions of spacetime, an old philosophical concept called \"[Non-physical entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-physical_entity)\")\n\nGoing back to the original question, in my opinion it's a big naive assumption to think these lifeforms would transport their biological forms (if they have one) in conventional looking crafts via fuel-based propulsion and we could \"interact\" with them as if interacting with a smart animal.",

For comparison, this is about 2,700 times the total solar energy received by the entire planet Earth.  Even if our instruments were a million times more sensitive, we couldn't 'hear' anything produced by earth-like communications instruments without a major global effort to send highly focused, millisecond pulses to our exact location.\n\n  And while I'm assuming a na\u00efve 'spherical shell' model of signal transmission, it would be nearly impossible to track such a distant target long enough to get even a 'blip'...a sweep of even a thousandth of a degree would cross hundreds of thousands of miles laterally in the targeted region, making the possibility of 'directional transmitters' a moot point.  RIP SETI@home, which scans(ed) around the sky way too fast.

It's quite possible that most life-containing planets out there haven't even developed multi-cellular organisms yet.",

We may be at the very early stages of a universe teeming with life",

Any planet / society would struggle even to make the decision to spend it on a trans system trip.  And then there's the time dilation - which is another issue added on top.  Visiting other solar systems for us will either be robotic only and centuries after launch, or using technology and mathematics and physics that we don't even have reason to believe really exists at this point.  And it may be the same for any other species out there.",

            "comment": "With respect, there is a fundamental flaw in your question. You assume that Earth has **not** been contacted yet.  It is entirely possible that aliens have been sending us light-based signals once every million years for a month over the last billion years. That would mean they have sent us a message a thousand times and received no response.  Humans have arguably had the ability to detect and recognize such a signal for only the last 0.01% of the most recent million years.  And it is even arguable now whether we have that ability.  Right now we have the capability to monitor only a tiny percentage of stars for signals.  \n\nIn addition, though physical travel is nearly impossible over the insanely huge distances involved, it is important to think about the experience of such aliens had they dropped by Earth every million years for the last billion years.  Life remained mostly small and microscopic until about 580 million years ago, when complex multicellular life arose, developed over time, and culminated in the Cambrian Explosion about 541 million years ago.  But even if they last visited only one million years ago there would have been no signs of intelligent life and no technology whatsoever.  Humans only started farming around 13,000 years ago, and have had satellites in space for less than 100 years.  We are absolute infants.  \n\nSomething else to keep in mind, which others have mentioned, is that it is entirely possible that intelligent species of aliens long ago concluded that the smartest thing any alien civilization can do is **stay hidden**.\n\nAre there war-like aliens out there who hunt emerging threats?  If so, one has to ask themselves whether sending out a bunch of messages is worth the risk of being discovered and potentially exterminated.",

            "comment": "For us to be contacted, it is not sufficient for life to be common in the galaxy. Rarity of some other things might also leave us alone.\n\n* First, life itself could be rare. And beginning of life is so rare that it doesn't happen elsewhere. (it is challenged because emergence of life on earth happen quickly after earth being born)\n\n* Life could be common, but multicellular life could be rare. In close to 4 billion year history of life, there were only two events that gave rise to multicellular life. And one of those events gave rise to plants.\n\n* It is also possible that even multicellular life is easy to come by, but it is so fragile that it got extinct before doing much. (We've faced several mass extinction events. And we live in a rather empty part of milkyway, on other planets asteroid collision or nearby supernova are much common)\n\n* Maybe multicellular life survives easily, but evolution of intelligence is tough. It took multicellular life 540 Million years to evolve first intelligent species. Also note that other Human species like Neanderthals were also intelligent beings, but even they are extinct now. Upto 20,000 years ago, us Homo Sapiens were not doing exceptionally great either. (IMO this could be the case with life on other planets).\n\nNow the next parts of \"life being rare\" would also apply to us, so let's see the ways in which humans don't visit other other stars.\n\n* Maybe Intelligent life is self destructing. Imagine us humans being wiped out by some super bacteria or nuclear war or skynet.\n\n* Maybe interstellar travel is tougher than we think. And we might never go beyond solar system (this point I don't believe personally)\n\n* We might choose not to colonize whole galaxy. Next 500 Million years we can spend just by moving Earth away and close to sun to be in goldilock zone and after that we may go to some nearby red dwarf star to spend next trillions of year.\n\n* We might colonize whole galaxy (or maybe even local galaxy group) but choose not to disturb other planetary bodies that already have life. We have taken care of moons of Jupiter, by crashing space probes into Jupiter, just to make sure that we don't infect or interfere with any life on those moons.\n\nSome of these hypotheses are called _Great Filters_.\n\nEDIT: Or maybe we have already been contacted. All those UFO videos are true and we are all doomed ;)",

            "comment": "To add to the Great Filter explanation for why we see no other intelligent life, I wonder too whether it's just as likely that advanced civilizations merely age and slowly die gracefully I'm a way similar to most organisms (as opposed to obliterating themselves with powerful forces).  With world population set to peak and then decline by 2050, I wonder if humanity's future as an advanced society is one not too different to that of a quiet retiree's, looking back fondly on good times and accepting an end that's not too far in the future.\n\nIf that's the case, then we'd have only had a few short hundred years where we were space capable or able to transmit messages across space.  If this were true, civilizations would ignite around the universe, enjoy a few hundred years of high technology, then blink out before having much time to contact one another.\n\nThere's something philosophically interesting about this possibility.  We always think of life as--- by definition--- something that is always trying to grow and expand and fill every crack.  But it's interesting to think of an elder intelligent society sitting back and saying to itself \"we've had a good life, now it's time to give someone else a chance.\"  It may just be that we humans have spent most of our history so far in our impetuous youth, and so we expect to go out and \"conquer the stars\" with that same youthful vigor.  But no one stays young forever.",

Such an event could happen spontaneously during an experiment, without warning or time to convey/communicate/document the results. Without confirmation (learning) of what caused the explosion, the other planet could simply repeat the same demise years later.\n\nMaybe only the ultra lucky aliens who receive numerous habitable worlds in their solar system (3, 4, 5, heck maybe 100+ even - like a super-Jupiter with 100 earth moons) actually survive long-term to figure out that doing XYZ in pursuit of science (ex. particle colliders creating mini black holes) is very very bad/dangerous/suicidal. So basically only 1 alien civilization in the entire universe is lucky.\n\nDisclosure: I have no idea if particle colliders are inherently bad. Just using that as an example.",

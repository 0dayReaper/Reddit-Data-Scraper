            "comment": "You're seeing fluorescence, not reflection. Fluorescent chemicals absorb (invisible or barely visible) ultraviolet light and re-emit it as visible light. The exact colors absorbed and emitted depend on the chemicals, and can be used to distinguish bodily fluids, as seen in [a recent *Scientific Reports* article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-30241-7).\n\nSurprisingly little seems to be known about the actual chemicals involved. The article linked above suggests tryptophan (an amino acid), miscellaneous small molecules like 4-pyridoxic acid, flavins, porphyrins, NADH and FAD, some proteins like collagen, and \"fluorescent oxidation products,\" which are presumed to be the result of oxidation of proteins and lipids. (Despite a widely repeated internet claim, it's not due to phosphorus. Elemental phosphorus is not present in any bodily fluid. Fortunately.)\n\nAs the article shows, stains can be fluorescent for many days, and for some fluids the fluorescence actually increases with time. So they could be old, if the sheets weren't washed. But I would expect most of these chemicals to be removed or destroyed in a wash, especially one with bleach. Some of the more proteiny stains could be difficult to remove completely in a single wash, though they wouldn't be actually dangerous at that point, if they ever were.\n\nIt's also worth noting that laundry detergents often contain fluorescent chemicals themselves, so some of the \"bodily fluids\" that people freak out about in hotels may actually be detergent that touched or dripped on the sheets as they were moved around the laundry room.",

Since most detergents contain bluing agents which glow white under UV, the contrast on fabric is stunning. I used to use an old rag in a forensics class. It had traces of dog blood (don\u2019t ask) and I stained other areas with wine, a soft drink and beets or something. Finding even slight blood residue was quite easy with the UV light and glasses.",

My humble (and brief) reply is that in the videos you mention, they're probably looking for semen stains because DNA will fluoresce when a UV light is shined on it. If forensic investigators are trying to obtain DNA samples, the light will show them what where to swab.",

            "comment": "It's chaotic because the act of emptying it from the container introduces forces on the water which disturb it. For instance, air will rush through the water to try to fill the space that the water is evacuating, as well the container itself has friction that will drag some of the water but not all of it.\n\nAir resistance itself will also do this, such as wester coming from a hose is nice and neat at the nozzle but quickly becomes chaotic and turned into droplets afterward.\n\nIf you were in a complete vacuum with a frictionless container you could feasibly just slide the container away from the water and have a perfectly shaped glob of water (although I think the surface tension of the water would turn it into a sphere regardless).",

A gas (strictly, the ideal gas) exhibits no cohesive forces between its molecules and still takes the shape of its container.\n\nWater, like other fluids, takes the shape of its container because, unlike solids, it has no shear strength or stiffness.",

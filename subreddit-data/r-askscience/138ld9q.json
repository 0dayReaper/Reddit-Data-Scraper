    "postText": "Texas experienced an 8 year drought from 49-57 with about 30% of the normal rainfall. Many cities ran out of water, and 30% of farms went away. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950s_Texas_drought\n\nAfter this the Corp of Engineers built hundreds of lakes to create reservoirs, and I was once told adding all these lakes actually changed the climate of Texas over many decades from a desert to what it is today. However, I have been unable to find any specific research that talks specifically about how the humidity has risen by x%, rainfall increased by x%, etc\u2026 \n\nDoes anyone have any research on this they can share, or just share your specific knowledge if easier?",

            "comment": "This seems to be built on a variety of flawed premises, but we can break this into two bits, (1) Does the construction of reservoirs generally influence local to regional climate? and (2) How has climate in Texas changed over the period in question?\n\n(1) Does the construction of reservoirs generally influence local to regional climate?\n\nYes, a bit, but not nearly as much as seems to be suggested here and also not necessarily in the direction assumed. There are a variety of studies looking at the effects of particular reservoirs, for example the reservoir created by the massive Three Gorges Dam, where work has suggested that this reservoir has a pretty minimal effect on local climate (e.g., [Wu et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618212002972), [Li et al., 2019](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018JD029970)). More general work looking at the influence of reservoir construction specifically on precipitation has been equivocal in the sense of suggesting that it can lead to minor increases or decreases in precipitation depending on the local details (e.g., [Winchester et al., 2017](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/eint/21/9/ei-d-16-0016.1.xml), [Zhao et al., 2021](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac263c/meta)). Specific to Texas, there is work to suggest that the presence of reservoirs may enhance convective thunderstorm formation, but the effect of this basically limited to the reservoir itself (e.g., [Haberlie et al., 2015](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/joc.4461)). More generally, this question seems predicated on the common idea that simply impounding water in a location will lead to more precipitation in that location, which in turn assumes that water evaporated locally primarily falls as precipitation locally. In reality, the precipitation recycling ratio (i.e., the ratio of precipitation that comes from local evaporation) can be extremely variable and it is in no way a given that simply making more surface water available for evaporation in an area will dramatically increase local precipitation if the PRR is low, e.g., see this [prior discussion of PRR with respect to this idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/wp7y7v/how_the_us_weather_be_different_if_the_western/).\n\n(2) How has climate in Texas changed over the period in question?\n\nThe analysis from [Gelca et al., 2014](https://twj-ojs-tdl.tdl.org/twj/article/view/7001/6100) spans much of the time period of interest and highlights that there have been some changes in the variability/intensity and seasonality of precipitation, but not much change in terms of average annual totals. The changes observed are related more to (global) climate change and not the (local) construction of reservoirs. More broadly, I'm not sure there's much veracity to the idea that the arid portions of Texas are somehow no longer arid. Looking to the future, if anything, aridity is expected to increase, not decrease (e.g., [Neilsen-Gammon et al., 2020](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2020EF001552)).",

I believe the lakes themselves don\u2019t have the size to change the climate, but the increase in availability of water has changed the amount and type of trees, how many homes can have green grass lawns, and after years of trees being planted, grass growing and lakes to support it the area no longer has a hard cap to push back the northern jet stream, so more and more thunderstorms seem to be hitting the area. I realize there may not be specific data on this, but as a Texan it sure feels different, and certainly looks totally different. Thank you again.",

Take a look at, for example, the shores of the Red Sea on google maps.  Despite the water, it's very dry along the shorelines, because there's nothing to cause the vapor to condense and fall as rain.",

None of the analysis of those data, for example in the Gelca paper, suggest that reservoirs or the associated changes you highlight have an appreciable effect on the climate in the region, or at least, an effect that is distinguishable from those related more clearly to global climate change. Ultimately there are two different things at play here, i.e., noticing change and attributing that change. You have noticed changes (and the data to some extent bear some of those out), but your attribution of those changes to being dominantly related to the building of reservoirs as opposed to anthropogenic climate change (and where similar changes in precipitation statistics, etc. are playing out throughout the globe) is not really supported by either the data analysis of the time series within Texas or modelling of the influence of reservoirs more generally. Land use cover changes can definitely have impacts on climate, whether that's through the building of reservoirs or other means, but isolating that from the broader global climate change is challenging and in this case, kind of missing the forest through the trees in terms of causation.",

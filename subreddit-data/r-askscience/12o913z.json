            "comment": "Lung doctor here.\n\nDogs [do hyperventilate](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.01380.2005) when [they pant](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/y67-001), which can lead to respiratory alkalosis.\n\nThere are different levels of panting. At lower temperatures, the panting isn't as pronounced, and the amount of air moved is relatively small. Like the volume of air is 50 mL, and the volume of the airway is 100 mL. This airway volume is called anatomic dead space. It doesn't participate in gas exchange. In this case, there isn't any respiratory alkalosis.\n\nHowever, if you agitate the air enough, the physiologic dead space will decrease. If the volume of air is 50 mL, but the dog is panting super fast, the air in the airway is mixing so much that there is increased gas exchange, and the dog will hyperventilate, which will result in respiratory alkalosis.\n\nThe ideal frequency of panting will depend on the resonant frequency of the respiratory system, so it is basically a function of the size of the animal.\n\nIn sick human patients, we used to use a mechanical ventilation mode called high frequency oscillatory ventilation, where we used tiny breath volumes much lower than anatomic dead space, and frequencies of 300-900 times a minute. It's the equivalent of panting. It was thought to protect the lung in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. It fell out of favor after the [OSCILLATE trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1215554), which was stopped early due to increased mortality. It's still used in kids. I think there was another study in kids that was going on but got derailed during COVID- I'm unsure of its current status. Anyway, in that mode of ventilation, you could definitely blow off carbon dioxide even though the tidal volume was less than the anatomic dead space.\n\nWhen I teach this to students, I often use an analogy of someone lighting a scented candle in the corner of a room. It might take a few minutes for someone at the other end to smell it. But if there is a ton of agitation in the room, like fans or people moving around, you would likely smell it sooner.",

Increased body temperature actually increases chemical metabolism that will decrease body ph which could cause metabolic acidosis.  Increased off-gassing would combat this effect.  Much less of a short term concern (not minutes) is that increased exercise increased lactic acid production (assuming an O2 deficit and anaerobic metabolism), which would also contribute to metabolic acidosis.",

The air at the end of the endotracheal tube is agitated so much, it rapidly diffuses to the alveolus. It's not really tidal ventilation at that point, so dead space doesn't apply.\n\nThink about putting food coloring into one end of a bathtub and then thinking of putting food coloring into the same bathtub with someone stirring it super fast. The food coloring immediately spreads out. In the first example, diffusion takes a long time. In the second example, diffusion is immediate. In HFOV, the vent is agitating the air so much that there really isn't any dead space.\n\nThere is a whole bit about how dogs can't breathe, just like in Bee movie about how bees can't fly. These statements are based off flawed premises.",

If we connected a patient to high frequency oscillatory ventilation, it wouldn't work because the obstruction would impede flow. to use the scented candle analogy, now imagine I put a wall up in the room with only a small window. All the fans on one side of the room aren't going to do much for that candle on the other side of the wall.\n\nHeliox is used to increase flow across that obstruction by reducing turbulence.",

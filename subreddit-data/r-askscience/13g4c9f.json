These systems include endocannabinoid system, and nitric oxide and nerve growth factor molecules. This transmission doesn't cause depolarization, it remains a chemical cascade inside the neuron.",

It wouldn't work in reverse because if a pre synaptic neuron released a neurotransmitter, let's say it's acetylcholine, but also had receptors for acetylcholine, every time that neuron released neurotransmitters it would activate itself\n\nEdit: changed would to \"wouldn't\"",

But there are some communication systems in the brain that work backwards, like the cannabis-related one, or ones involving gases and growth. This can go from the receiving part of the cell to the sending part. But this process doesn't make the nerve cells all electric and buzzy. Instead, it's just a bunch of chemical reactions happening inside the nerve cell.",

            "comment": "Likelihood of something like that happening is near zero:\n\nBack propagation of APs is constrained to very specific circumstances. There are mechanisms involving channel kinetics of the sodium VG channel which largely prevent back propagation \"echos\" forming from anterograde APs. Further, someone else here mentioned absence of schwann/oligodendrocyte contact at the soma and dendrites. Their presence helps reduce decay of the AP through time and over the length of the axon, so without these cells, even a backpropagating AP might decay immediately. You've also got the issue of lack of the structural components at the dendrite necessary for retrograde synaptic transport - it's too involved to get into on Reddit, but it's likely the vesicular recycling system at the dendrite and spine is too slow or simple to allow for instantaneous release of transmitter-laden vesicles (and which NT is even synthesized/loaded at the spine for this to happen?). Even if it wasn't, the abundance of VG calcium channels in the spine may not be sufficient to allow for quick and full fusion to occur - especially because the standard presynaptic fusion machinery is missing at the dendritic spine. We know this because it is possible to biochemically separate and examine pre- and post-synaptic compartments. Finally, post-synaptic ionotropic NT receptors would have to be present on the synaptic terminal of the pre-synaptic cell in a great enough number to respond to the (likely feeble) release of NTs from the spine. \n\nMost likely, the back propagation of APs is a method by which the neuron can modulate plastic response due to repeated firing. I think dendro-dendritic transmission is another way by which backpropagating NTs could elicit an AP in another neuron, but I would have to check my notes all the way back from grad school for that.\n\nSource: Me (I'm a PhD level neuroscientist in the US) Hope this helped.",

For example,  the mitral cells and the granule cells form dendrodendritic synapses - dendrites forming synapses with dendrites of other cells, as against the typical axodendritic synapses. These dendrodendritic synapses are reciprocal - both cells are presynaptic as well as postsynaptic to each other. Mitral cell action potentials get synaptically transmitted to excite granule cells, while granule cell action potentials get synaptic transmitted to inhibit mitral cells. Given the reciprocal nature of the synapses, in fact,  means that when mitral cell sends excitatory signal to the granule cell, the reciprocal synapse gets activated, inhibiting the mitral cell, without the need for a backpropagating action potentials in the granule cell. Those become relevant to inhibit other mitral cells the same granule cell forms reciprocal synapses with.\n\nOther cells with \"normal\" synapses can't transmit in the other direction, but the postsynaptic terminals have other trucks up their sleeves: neuromodulators, for example.",

In fact, this is the primary function of endocannabinoids.\n\nIf this is not what you meant, there is *still* a somewhat rarer type of synapse where electrical back propagation is possible, and that is through gap junctions.",

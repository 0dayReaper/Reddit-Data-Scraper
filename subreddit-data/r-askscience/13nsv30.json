            "comment": "When a caterpillar reaches a certain point of its growth, hormones are activated and released throughout its body. These chemical signals affect the caterpillar\u2019s behavior and physiology, for example it will stop feeding, find somewhere to settle down, and tissues in the body will break down, change, and develop due to new genes becoming activated in the cells. \n\nA common misconception is that everything in the caterpillar \u201cturns to goo\u201d and is rebuilt during pupal transformation. Indeed a lot of cellular structures do in fact break down and differentiate during this stage of development, but there are also structures called \u201cimaginal discs\u201d in the caterpillar that are sort of like miniature adult organs in \u201chibernation\u201d. Here\u2019s a [video](https://youtu.be/ZHqsZOPvKiA) I made of one of my old lab mates explaining this process on how butterfly wings develop in the pupa. \n\nSource: spent a PhD thinking about how butterflies make their wings",

But in a very clumsy attempt to summarise it into reddit post length: cells start sending out different chemical messages based on external factors. An important one is spatial orientation with respect to gravity. Cells closer to the gravitational centre will start producing chemical signals that are different from the cells furthest from the gravitational centre. These chemicals diffuse through the developing organism and cells start to receive different messages about how they should express their genes based on a \"concentration gradient\". Put simply, the cells closer to the source of the signalling molecules will receive a larger dose than those further away and the genes they express become differentiated based on this difference in concentration of \"dose\". Once this initial differentiation is achieved, increasingly complex signals are sent to neighbouring cells based on prior differentiation. It's very complicated but you could read up on something called the \"French Flag Model\" in embryology to get a beginners grasp of what is going on.",

Lots of good info in there (especially pages 41-42, 436-451, 572-575).\n\nQuick summary (correct me if I'm wrong on this stuff):\n\n* in the larval stage, specialized tissue (imaginal disks &amp; histoblasts) develops that will eventually turn into adult organs\n* as the larva grows, size sensors in the epithelium, at certain checkpoints, trigger molting and eventually metamorphosis\n* metamorphosis is triggered by a central release of long-distance hormones that affect both proteins (as in early development) and non-proteins\n* in the pupa stage, programmed cell death removes old structures (gut, salivary glands, some muscles), recovering nutrients\n* legs&amp;wings develop from the imaginal disks; torso from the histoblasts; in a way that's not that dissimilar from early development",

The larvae are eating machines and the adults are reproductive machines. This probably happens all over the place, but it is really obvious in the holometabolous insects. It isn\u2019t so different from plants that grow for a long time and then totally exhaust themselves flowing once (turning on a totally different developmental program).",

The absence of gravity influenced every mechanical aspect of pupation, but ultimately butterflies did occur but suboptimal because of the influence of the mechanics of pupation, not the chemical action",

Essentially, the chemicals serve as signals for which cells should turn into what. It's actually pretty difficult if you think about it. For example, imagine that you're in a classroom, and a teacher tells the class to break yourselves up into 4 equally-sized groups. But you're only allowed to speak to the people sitting next to you. It can be difficult to figure out which group you should join, because nobody really has a full picture of what all the groups currently look like. That's essentially the same challenge that cells are trying to solve. They need to decide which cells become the body, which become the legs, which become the wings, etc.\n\nThe way that cells solve this issue is that they \"elect\" a representative to oversee the grouping. These representative cells still don't know what all the other cells are doing, but at least everyone agrees to listen to the lead of the representatives. The representative cells are dependent on the species. Some are chosen because they're in the tail. Some are chosen because they're in the head. Some are chosen because they're at the bottom, some because they're at the top.\n\nThese representative cells release a chemical that spreads throughout the rest of the body. But the trick is, the cells nearest to the representative cells will detect the most amount of chemicals, while the cells farthest away will detect the least amount of chemicals. The cells have a hard-coded sensor in their DNA that essentially says, \"if I detect this much of the chemical, then I'm a leg cell. If I detect this much of the chemical, then I'm a head cell, etc.\"\n\nOnce each of the cells have divided themselves into their rough groupings, the groups then elect their own representative cells to further subdivide them. For instance, in the \"leg cell\" group, the cells elect the leg tip cells to be the representative, and the leg tip cells release their own chemicals. And again, the cells closest to the representatives will detect the most amount of chemicals,  while the cells farthest away will detect the least. And the cells again have a hard-coded sensor that says, \"if I detect this much of the chemical, then I'm a leg joint, if I detect this much, then I'm a leg muscle, etc.\"\n\nThis is a vast oversimplification, but this is generally what happens for cells to sort themselves into a functioning animal",

I'm really a microbiologist with just a little bit of passing knowledge on developmental biology, so I can't give you a perfect or up-to-date answer. But my understanding is that cells have a bunch of mechanisms that allow themselves to self-elect \"representative\" cells.\n\nOne of the more common mechanisms is one where all the cells try to get all their neighbors to \"quit the race,\" so to speak. In a really oversimplified explanation, what happens is that each cell produces a protein on its surface. When nearby cells (let's call them Cell B) bump into the first cell (Cell A), Cell B detects how much of that protein Cell A has, and Cell B stops producing its own protein in response. Cell B also tries to do the same thing to Cell A. So you have Cell A trying to get Cell B to stop making the protein, and Cell B is trying to get Cell A to stop making the same protein. Eventually, one cell wins out  by sheer chance. Let's say in this case,  Cell A wins. Then Cell B stops making the protein and basically \"gives up\" its \"electoral race.\" This happens for all the cells in the squishy ball of embryo cells, and the end result is that more and more cells drop out of the race until only 1 remains.\n\nAnother way that cells can self-sort is that cells can \"hold hands\" with their neighbors, causing them to form clumps. And these clumps are fairly specific. For instance, cells can decide not to cling to other cells if the cells are too different from themselves. Or the cells can decide to only cling to other cells if the other cells are different. And so eventually, certain types of cells will end up in certain parts of the embryo.\n\nYou can imagine that you can get some wildly complex interactions if you mix and match just these 2 mechanisms. In general, though, there's still a lot unknown about developmental biology. (You'll find that this is a very common sentiment in any field of research - you'd be surprised by just how *little* we know.) I haven't followed research in developmental biology in maybe 6 or 7 years, and from what I remember, these mechanisms that I described have only just been found just a couple years before then. \n\n&gt;how does it know if it is to form the head or leg section?\n\nDepends on the species, really. But for a given species, it's always the same. So for, let's say, an insect, the representative cells will always form the head",

It is extremely hard to find info on this since any web search just brings up the superficial descriptions of metamorphosis. \n\nAre you sure gravity has anything to do with it?  I'd think any gravitational gradient across it would be so small as to be undetectable.  Has it been checked in zero g experiments? I'd think the signaling would be relative to some predetermined point.  For instance, in the human egg the point where the sperm enters the egg seems to initiate a point of reference.\n\nEdit:  For some reason there is very little online about gravity and metamorphosis.  This is the best I could find.  It says a zero gravity experiment confirmed that metamorphosis completed successfully.\n\nhttps://fb.watch/kFXqkbviHu/?mibextid=NnVzG8\n\nEdit2: I can see how you'd get a gravitational top/bottom as hemolyph could be affected by it.",

So a cocoon isn\u2019t necessary for pupation.\n\nThe process of growing some adult organs begins well before pupation: if you look closely at a chrysalis or a moth pupa (outside of its cocoon), you can see that small versions of wings, antennae, adult mouthparts, etc., are already present, but wrapped tightly around the pupa\u2019s body.",

After a few repetitions, a caterpillar sensing the vibrations will coil up in anticipation of the shock.\n\nFor me, caterpillar to butterfly transformation looks like an egg phase was interrupted by a caterpillar phase, and then continued.\n\nThe eggs are too small to contain all necessary nutrients to develop a full-sized insect. So at a certain phase a caterpillar comes out to munch on leaves, and then goes back to developing into an adult.\n\nNot related, but something else about retaining memories. Small nematodes (worms) were treated with unpleasant stimuli, and then killed, and fed to another group of worms (not treated with the stimuli).

If the brain is actually destroyed and a new brain is built, then any memories in old brain are destroyed too.  What the caterpillar/butterfly evidently has is a way of storing information in chemical form outside the brain, for the next stage of the organism to take up.  It's analogous to writing a diary for your kid to read and learn from, or the protagonist in [*Memento*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film\\)) taking photographs to inform his future self of what he cannot remember.",

Neurologically, a whole lot of nothing needs to happen while in its chrysalis. The brain and ganglia could get moved around and even physically re-shaped without destroying or breaking the links between individual neurons. On the other hand, a butterfly has no need for the networks that coordinate many-legged undular locomotion (for example) so those could certainly be destroyed or recycled.",

Hence my reply, \"If the brain is actually destroyed and a new brain is built\".\n\nAs to another claim made about nematodes, though, \n\n&gt; Not related, but something else about retaining memories. Small nematodes (worms) were treated with unpleasant stimuli, and then killed, and fed to another group of worms (not treated with the stimuli). The second group then started to respond to the stimuli without being taught.\n\nthat is most definitely not \"memory.\"",

            "comment": "There are three ways to [transfer heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer)- conduction, convection and radiation. \n\n[Conduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction) is the most \"straight forward\" version of heating- object 1 is in contact with object 2, and heat is transferred from the hot one to the cold one. Also, conduction is what heats an entire object if you're only applying heat to one place. You can think of the object as a bunch of different objects, all touching, and heat is conducted between them. How quickly and efficiently this happens is determined by the [thermal conductivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity) of the material. \n\n[Convection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection_(heat_transfer\\)) is the dominant form of heat transfer in fluids (fluids being liquids and gases, so inside the Earth's atmosphere, convection dominates), which is heat being taken from one place to another via a fluid. So for instance, as the Earth is warmed up, it is convection which transfers the heat to the atmosphere which then is transferred to you. \n\nYou are correct that neither of these methods work between the Sun and Earth. But the third kind, [radiative heating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_radiation) works fine in a vacuum. That is the transfer of heat via thermal radiation- aka photons. Photons have no problem propagating through space, and thus the Sun is able to heat the Earth via that method. \n\nFor the temperatures of most things on Earth, radiative heating is minor, so it's why using vacuum insulation (in something like a coffee mug) works so well. But for really hot objects (like the Sun) radiative heating works great.",

It seems to me that convection is just heat being conducted by a fluid in motion.\n\nRadiation is meaningfully different since it doesn't require \"physical contact.\" Though since atoms can't touch each other, is that even a notable difference? I guess radiation uses excitement from electromagnetic waves, and conduction would also use the electromagnetic fields of atoms close to each other.\n\nIs it all the same thing?",

Hot air molecules transfer heat to other air molecules, or to various objects in the environment, via Conduction.  It just has the added layer of complication that the air also moves around.  It means that the heat propagates faster because hot fluid is moving around, transferring heat to more objects and allowing heat to be transferred to more fluid.",

At a fundamental level, the actual heat transfer is happening by conduction. But because the fluid is moving, convection works significantly differently from a static scenario where simple conduction is happening. In particular, you're continually introducing new fluid with a different energy content to the same location of the static object that it's conducting heat into, so convection can heat (or cool) things much faster than simple conduction. In the limit where the fluid velocity approaches zero, the convection solution becomes the conduction solution.",

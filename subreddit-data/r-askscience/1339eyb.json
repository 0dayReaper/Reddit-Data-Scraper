There are brown dwarfs known with gas giant sized bodies orbiting them, see [OGLE-2017-BLG-1522](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05095) for an example (46 M_J to 0.75 M_J).",

                    "comment": "The brown dwarf territory makes things murky as it depends on who you believe on the definition of a planet. Using the IAU definition (which is actually pretty poor) they are not, but using a more sensible definition, like that proposed by Soter, then planets can have a mass up to approximately 75 times the mass of Jupiter. The key difference being the formation pathway.\n\n\nHowever, with Soters definition one has to be careful as the above example of a planet around a brown dwarf (OGLE-2017-BLG-1522) may not be applicable if the brown dwarf formed through stellar formation pathways. The question would then be if there are suitable formation pathways, which I think would be quite challenging through the gravitational instability mechanism (the only mechanism we have to form such massive planets from a protoplanetary disc).",

            "comment": "some thoughts:\n\njupiter has about the biggest diameter a planet cat get. add more mass to jupiter and it actually shrinks. more mass means more gravitational pull. and more pull means that the gas is compressed more. a typical brown dwarf is about the same size as jupiter but has much more mass.\n\ntechnically, charon is not the moon of pluto. charon and pluto form a gravitationally bound system. charon is big enough, that the common center of mass is outside of pluto. therefore it is more correct to say, that pluto and charon orbit that common center of mass than that charon orbits pluto.\n\nyour question basically boils down do: how did both of those objects form? if we assume \"normal\" planet building, we assume, that there was some kind of disk with stuff around a newly formed star. the denser stuff (the dust) somehow clumped together and formed a planetesimal. then the gaseous stuff (mostly hydrogen and helium) gathered around that planetesimal and formed the actual gas giant.\n\nif that new planet is that big, it is actually quite unlikely, that after it formed, there was enough of the gasenous stuff left to form a second gas giant in the close vicinity. all that stuff would have been already collected by the first object.\n\nhowever: planets tend to migrade when they are young. they change their orbits over time before they kind of find a stable orbit. so it is perfectly possible, that two planets have formed in different regions of that star system and both became gas giants. and then their orbits kind of overlapped and they came so close toanother, that they got gravitationally bound. in fact, most stars seem to be part of star pairs. sometimes, there are even two pairs of stars, orbiting a common center of mass. but to maintain a stable orbit, they would have to be very far away from each other.\n\nand yeah - it is hard enough to detect that object from earth - but to determine, that those objects not only orbit their star but also each other is on another level.\n\nspace is big, there are billions of stars in our milky way alone, and it seems that most of those stars have planets. so why not? a gas cloud, big enough to form a quite big star but also a brown dwarf companion. and that brown dwarf then forces a gas giant in its orbit. if the star is big enough and the brown dwarf actually orbits it, we would call the brown dwarf a planet (technically an exoplanet - per current definition a planet orbits our sun).\n\nbut i think that it is much more likely, that all those objects \"just orbit a common center of mass\" and therefore are \"only\" bound objects, not planets.",

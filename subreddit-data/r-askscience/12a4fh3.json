            "comment": "First, we could compare certain features that are common to all life on earth. For example many of the building blocks of life such as sugars and amino acids can come in two versions, left-handed and right-handed, which are mirrors of each other.  All known life on earth can only use right-handed sugar molecules.  At the same time all the amino acids used are the left-handed versions.   If we were to find a life form that used the opposite version of either (or both) it would be a strong indicator it wasn\u2019t related to any other existing life on earth.  \n\nSpeaking of amino acids and DNA, that\u2019s another example.  All life on earth uses DNA, and that DNA stores information using the same 4 nucleotides, cytosine [C], guanine [G], adenine [A] or thymine [T].  If we were to discover a life form which either did not use DNA at all or had DNA which used some other nucleotides it would also be a strong indication that such life is not related to any life on earth.",

The comment above mine seemed to assert that the chirality we have on this planet would likely be the same anywhere, and I can't see any reason it would be, beyond 50/50 chance. I understand the systems that enforce it on earth, our planet has chosen a side and everything else is not included in biology, so there are a lot of earth-chiral molecules all over.",

If your base enzymes's show chirality in their active sites so will the substrates that can enter and be catalysed which high affinity. Right hand right glove so to speak. The alternate enantiomer may be fully sterically hindered from entering or just interact with the R groups in active site residues with a low enough affinity/k that the kinetics just massively favour the opposing enantiomer. This is pretty easy to imagine with flatish ring form pentose and hexose sugars since those juicy polar lone pair sporting hydroxyls stick either out the front or towards the back of the ring. Since most as diasteromers or even more complex it would be super easy for the majority of configs to have half the H bonds or less entering towards catalytic residues compared to the favoured stereoisomer.  \n\nI speculate maybe the early preferences are due to the exact nature of the alternate pathway used in the catalysis - maybe some of the chiral active residues in the active site act as chiral auxillaries in much the same way our synthesis of taxol works by actively forcing the chiral carbons in the product to take a certain steric enantiomer.",

That it arose from a separate abiogensis event on Earth.  We would need to examine other evidence in and around the environment to look for clues for possible off world origin.\n\nBut its not so simple as to discount such life as being terrestrial based on the criteria you mention.  For one thing depending on the complexity of such life, mutation alone could not necessarily account for it.  Mirror life would require an entire mirror ecosystem to function.  If we were, for example, to be create a machine that could mirror a person, that person would be able to breathe, and drink water without issue, but they would shortly starve to death (or have some severe adverse reaction and perhaps die even quicker) even if given normal food, because the chirality of the elements in our food would not work with their biology.  \n\nIn fact that hostility between biospheres would make it less likely for both types of life to have developed and existed on Earth for a long period of time.  Consider that simple cyanobacteria (aka blue-green algae) require only water, CO2, inorganic substances, and light to live.  They form a large part of the very basic level of the food chain on earth and don't depend on chiral nutrients to survivor, unlike most other forms of life.  As a result, should a mirror version exist and be introduced into the same environment it could out compete the normal version as it would completely lack predators and be immune to any normal disease.  If it were to out compete and wipeout the normal cyanobacteria, it would be catastrophic.  The result would be a massive collapse of the oceanic food chain.  Meanwhile the odds that a biosphere like the one that OP describes could have remained isolated goes down significantly the further back we go.  This in turn implies its more likely that extraterrestrial origin + temporary isolation is the explanation vs. terrestrial origin + long term isolation.",

New life developing in that exact spot out of all the available locations on the planet is unlikely. New life developing on another planet, surviving the journey to earth, and landing in that exact spot is far more unlikely. We already know life can develop here. The other theory requires a whole other planet with the right conditions, a journey of light years through the vacuum of space, surviving high velocity impacts, and landing in just the right spot.",

Let's say there was a hydrothermal vent that was buried in a cave that had never ever had any exposure to any other part of the planet. This part erupted and was exposed to the outside world and somehow life had evolved in that cave using the hydrogen sulfide as a source of energy developing a food chain based on it. \n\nIncidentally, this did happen in the hydrothermal events at the bottom of the ocean, but they were still seeded by life with the same origin as everything else on earth. So they use the same sugar and amino acids. They also have DNA either in a double helix (eukaryotic) or a circle (prokaryotic). \n\nHowever, if there was somehow a part of the planet that had a food source like I described and no exposure at all to the rest of the planet, like the OP's cave example, yes, it's possible that life would have evolved there. Because this life would not share any common origin with the rest of the life on Earth, everything could be completely different. It could be silicone based instead of carbon-based. It could use a different mechanism for storing and propagating cellular instructions. Its chemistry could be fantastically different, and, yes, we would have no way to know if it came from another world or not. Actually, we aren't even sure that life on earth originated here. We have proven that life can survive in space, and life could have easily landed here. \n\nOne hypothesis to answer Fermi's paradox is that life is so incredibly rare that the reason Venus is a hellhole right now is it never developed a carbon cycle because the odds of developing one in time before your planet has a runaway greenhouse effect is extremely small. Basically, the odds of earth happening is probably in the one in a billion range. This would mean that life likely exists in many worlds, but they are so horrendously spread out that we are extremely unlikely to encounter any.",

Nucleic acids, even the autocatalytic microRNAs require quite a bit of protein intereaction to stabilise them and in order to have RNA you first need to be producing sugars. We get a bit stuck up on information as the starting point for life since replicating systems are directed by it - there's no guarantee and quite a bit to suggest that metabolic flux predates something like transcription by exploiting pH gradients between metal oxide saturated alkaline waters and non-metal saturated acidic waters from atmospheric gases and using sulphur iron clusters to catalyze the redox reactions needed to generate lipid micelles. Nick Lane's lab and others have been making stride in this area recently and while not 100% convincing yet it's a better cell than sponteaneously generating an RNA world first. Basically you get a Krebs cycle then branch off into other biosynthetic pathways. Once you have that sealed compartment you can start pushing up the concentrations of simple organic molecules to satisfy the requirements to start synthesising amino acids and nucleotides. Who knows the actual origins but this seams much more likely to be true than trying to resolve an information paradox and spinning everything else off after it.",

While slightly more intelligence is more better, we have to remember that it has a cost, bigger brains require more energy. So more intelligence is more better, but is it more betterer than the extra energy is less betterer? My conjecture is that in the vast number of circumstances, no, it's not more betterer. Only very rarely are the circumstances such that it actually enters a runaway intelligence explosion like we saw in humans.\n\nAfter all, life had all the ingredients for it for a couple hundred million years, but it only happened once, and only in the last million or so.",

So it's ironic that humans bastardised popular philosophy into these regressive cult-like practices we see around today. Though, there are plenty of successful religions, like ones we see in Indigenous Australia and America, where belief in an afterlife/reincarnation plays no significant part, if any part at all. Rather the spiritual side is used to explain scientifics and the traditions are scaffolds to guide people toward finding a philosophic meaning. Some are much more suggestive than others (e.g. Buddhism is heavily suggestive where Taoism is considered open-ended).",

It is currently believed that \"crabs\" (of the marine variety) have evolved five independent times from separate decapod groups. That is to say that five separate species, each less than crab-like, followed a generational series of mutations which eventually resulted in a shared set of traits that constitute what we think of as a \"crab\". This process has happened completely naturally, well before human interference would have come into play. \n\nNext take a look into the domestic breeding experiment done in Siberia on Silver Foxes. Here, foxes were selectively breed for domesticative traits. Each generation the foxes would be scored for tameness, and the top 10% (most tame) would be used to breed the next generation. The interesting part here is what happened to the fox populations physiological and social traits as the selection continued. The foxes started to develop floppy ears, curly tails, rounder more dog-like snouts. Their fur patterns changed to display more mottling, their reproductive periods lengthened. In addition to the friendly behavior that they were being selected for, they also showed the ability to follow the human gaze similar to dogs. While the study has drawn some criticism over methodology (the foxes weren't \"wild\" to begin with, some traits may have had minor representation in the population from the outset), the suggestion remains that if you have two similar yet distinct species and selectively breed one of them to display a trait that the other possesses, they will likely begin to display other shared traits that were not selected for as well. While this is likely far from the whole story, it does make some sense intuitively, as we would expect that if a survival method was effective for one species then it would likely be effective for another, assuming the environment and ecosystem present similar enough challenges.",

Goldman said, \"Starting at one month of age, and continuing every month throughout infancy, the foxes were tested for their reactions to an experimenter. The experimenter would attempt to pet and handle the fox while offering it food. In addition, the experimenters noted whether the foxes preferred to spend time with other foxes, or with humans.\" After the fox had reached sexual maturity at an age of seven to eight months, \"they had their final test and assigned an overall tameness score.\" Among the factors that went into this score were the tendency \"to approach an experimenter standing at the front of its home pen\" and \"to bite the experimenters when they tried to touch it.\" By way of ensuring that the pups' tameness was a result of genetic selection and not of interactions with human beings, the foxes were not subjected to any kind of training and were only permitted brief periods of contact with people.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;As reported on by Trut, the tests for tameness took the following form, which was still in use as of 2009: \"When a pup is one month old, an experimenter offers it food from his hand while trying to stroke and handle the pup. The pups are tested twice, once in a cage and once while moving freely with other pups in an enclosure, where they can choose to make contact either with the human experimenter or with another pup. The test is repeated monthly until the pups are six or seven months old.\" At the age of seven or eight months, the pups are given a tameness score and placed in one of three groups. The least domesticated are in Class III; those that allow humans to pet and handle them, but that do not respond to contact with friendliness, are in Class II; the ones that are friendly with humans are in Class I. After only six generations, Belyayev and his team had to add a higher category, Class IE, the \"domesticated elite\", which \"are eager to establish human contact, whimpering to attract attention and sniffing and licking experimenters like dogs. They start displaying this kind of behavior before they are one month old. By the 20th generation 35% were 'elite', and by the 30th generation 70% to 80% of the selected generation was 'elite.'\"  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Once the foxes in each generation had been classified according to the latest research, only the least fearful and least aggressive foxes were selected for breeding. Goldman said, \"In each successive generation, less than 20 percent of individuals were allowed to breed\". The sole criterion for permitting them to breed was their tolerance of human contact.\n\nWhile this is of course still subject to human observation, and therefore bias, it is much harder to mistake the perception of tameness vs actual tameness when you're counting the number of bites.",

            "comment": "&gt; The organisms inside are completely alien to anything native to earth.  \n\nThe answers so far are disregarding this part of your question. I interpret this as: the organisms don't have nucleic acid (no RNA or DNA), they don't rely on sugars for metabolism, they don't have enzymes built from the same ~20 amino acids, and they don't use phospholipids for their membranes. If all those things are true (four \"don't\"s), we can say the cave life evolved independently from Earth life as we know it (or... as we *knew* it) - I'll refer to this as \"Elawki\" below.  \n\nRegarding whether or not the organisms are native to Earth: there would be no way of knowing. Assuming these organisms are thriving in their environmental niche (the cave), they may well have arisen via [abiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis), just as we *speculate* was the origin of Elawki. But even for Elawki, we cannot be sure if it actually originated on Earth, or if it was seeded via [cosmic contamination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia) (e.g. a meteorite). We can't know which was the case without a time machine (or new evidence of life on other planets), and that goes for both Elawki and for the cave life you asked about.  \n\nMy personal opinion is that abiogenesis is extremely rare/unlikely, so it happening twice on one planet feels unlikely to the point of impossibility. It happening even *once* on our planet in ~4 billion years feels impossibly unlikely! But here we are...  \n\n___\n\nFun fact related to your question: there's life at the bottom of the ocean that relies on heat and chemicals for their energy (chemosynthesis), instead of the sun. Even though their fundamental energy source is markedly distinct from that of *all* surface life, the deep sea life still has all four traits in common with the rest of Elawki (the four \"don't\"s above are all \"do\"s). But - the really mind-melting thing for me - we have no idea which type of metabolism evolved first, or if the ancestral metabolism was something else entirely. In other words, we don't know if the chemosynthesizers are the ancestors of the photosynthesizers (including eaters thereof), or if it's the other way around. It's crazy to imagine life evolving at the bottom of the ocean, thriving on thermal vents, and then gradually finding a way to harness the power of the sun. The opposite migration is just as interesting, as is a divergent path where the two types of metabolism descended from something that left no evolutionary trace.",

We have **eukaryotes**, which is humans, birds, jellyfish, plants, mushrooms - basically any type of life you an actually see.\n\nThen there's bacteria. That's self explanatory.\n\nThe third is archea. They diverged from our evolutionary path a bit later than bacteria did, so archea are in a way more similar to us than to bacteria, but to describe what they are, just think about bacteria. Take for instance the grand prismatic spring in Yellowstone. The color is because of microbes, and most people tend to assume that means bacteria, but it's not. They're tiny little single celled organisms that are genetically more different from bacteria than you are to a shitake mushroom.\n\nAnyway all of these three domains of life have a common ancestor. Alien life would not be classified as a new domain of life, we'd probably have to come up with another name for the category.",

Sometimes the same thing is created from very different bases multiple times throughout history and spread across multiple regions.  There is consideration and some evidence that ubiquitin evolved multiple times independently (even after we already had ubiquitin from other genes), as have some other seemingly uniform features.  Variations of ubiquitin do pop up but typically die out fast because they just aren't able to survive. \n\nProteins aren't just shaped and then told what to do: their shape and structure determines how useful they are. With a strong purifying natural selection, like no other form being remotely as capable...  Well, this is potentially similar to one of the reasons that silicon based life is potentially not possible and seemingly couldn't arise even though earth has much more silicone than carbon. Silicone just isn't as efficient and its interactions are far less capable of the energy-balanced variety that carbon chemistry shows.\n\nSince not all life on Earth has ubiquitin, but all multicellular life does, it is entirely possible that the development of ubiquitin and systems built off of its capabilities is a major factor in how complex a cellular organism is able to become. If there are multiple possible ways to get the same thing efficiently, we'd be more likely to encounter other branches of life that evolved without it.  Now, depending on if its functions are still required in different environments, or even how different an environment can be after initial life terraforms the environment, it may still show up in anything advanced.\n\nTalking about statistics in general though isn't much of a point of shutdown for extraterrestrial biology. Terrestrial biology already shows how unlikely things happen a ton given millions or billions of years, and with how big the universe is, yes, nonzero, even \"functionally zero\" in normal standards, isn't actually zero. The human brain just has a reaaaaaallly hard time comprehending the scale of both time and potential environments.\n\nThat said, maybe you have more to add.

In life as we know it, we already see multiple nucleic acids that are capable of storing genetic information: RNA and DNA. It would be incredibly unlikely, in my opinion, of life had a totally different origin and still settled on one of those two molecules. There are countless \"variations on a theme\" around nucleic acid (or very similar molecules) that could get the job done. Abiogenesis had to happen *somewhere* (either on Earth or in some other environment in the cosmos) and I suspect DNA/RNA were simply a good balance between (1) capacity to emerge semi-randomly in a non-life setting, and (2) functionality to support information storage and self-replication. Even if this molecular structure has some advantages, I would expect *some* fundamental variation in life that independently arose. But you're right - it's not guaranteed. This is why I said \"almost certainly\". It's incredibly tough to know any of this stuff with absolute certainty.",

All life on earth use the same codons (group of three nucleotides) to code for specific amino acids (with a few exceptions but marginal for 1 or 2 codons in some weird clade). This code may be a little optimized (third nucleotide wooble for instance) so some similarity could exist in an alien species but it's mostly random: no particular reason for GGG and GGC to code for proline, it's just the match that was used in the common ancestor of all life on earth.

In either case it means there is likely life outside of earth.\n\nRight now it is impossible to tell the likelihood of life spontaneously occurring on a random planet.\n\nIf life spontaneously occurred twice on one planet, it would mean life is \"common\" and we can expect it elsewhere.",

If they are in an underground cave on Earth, it\u2019s most likely that they evolved in the cave, on Earth, and are thus from Earth. Rather than jumping to the conclusion that they\u2019re from outer space. Essentially, you\u2019d need convincing evidence that they\u2019re NOT from earth.",

There are markers in the DNA of Earth creatures that establish their position in the phylogenetic tree of life.\n\nAll living creatures on Earth that we've found so far descend from a common ancestor, and the fingerprints of that exist in the genetic codes of everything we've looked at so far.\n\nAn alien species would not have that fingerprint of universal ancestry. They wouldn't fit in the phylogenetic tree, anywhere. \n\nI guess the only trick at that point would be deciding if there was an entirely new ancestry tree from a different original life form, or if they were ETs. But having DNA at all, instead of something different all together would be an indication",

This question makes no sense, they may not be native to your particular sub-climate or environment, but that is generally true for all species on different parts of the planet. They just evolved to survive in their microenvironment, they are just as belonging to Earth as everything you are familiar with already.",

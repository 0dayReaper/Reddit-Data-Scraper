    "postText": "I'm taking a course in immunology and here it is mentioned that enzymes and peptides are part of the chemical \"barrier\" in the gut. Since enzymes are basically long peptides that create big complexes, I wonder what the purpose of making that distinction is. I read online that, in general, peptides function as signalling molecules. Is that the case here as well or do they have more functions?",

            "comment": "Peptide -: (Just protein fragments that are non functional themselves but can act as Aiding agents or signallers)\n\n1) Bond with Cellular Membrane Phospholipds and create layer thus preventing bacterial permeation     \n2) They themselves act as smallet bacterial fragmemt and bind to lymphocytes therby inititing the immunological response and thus generating antibodies (that way they act as immunomodulator)  \n  \nEnzymes-:  (Fully functional peptide complex that has \"Specific target site and Specific Action\"\n 1) In these case mostly other enzymes mostly \"lyases\" help to rupture the bacterial membrane and thus destroying the cell itself.   \n2) Enzymes has ability to bind to specific target locations. So exploit this. Instead of making drug that targets the specific site, just attach the drug to enzyme and that enzyme will take the drug and bind to that specific location as carrier  Eg. bactriophage encoded enzyme - where one natural microbe that prey on other but not affevting humans host are encoded with enzyme targetted  \n3) Even some enzyme can directl target specifically bind to active site of bacteria/virus therby rendering it ineffctive\n\nNatural enzymes like lysozymes complex present in all human cell release extremely corrosive chemicals that dissolve and degrade the cell and its components",

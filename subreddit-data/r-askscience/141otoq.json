    "postText": "Hey all,\r  \n\r  \nit's a question I keep coming back to as I work on my thesis and I do not yet have a solid idea about this.\r  \n\r  \nSay, on a behavioral level person A has a significantly smaller difference than person B in reaction times between the congruent and incongruent conditions in a Stroop-test (indicating better inhibitory control). How would you imagine they would differ in an EEG recording?\r  \n\r  \nI tried my best in researching this myself, but all I could find sound evidence for is the [association between n2/n4 and inhibition as a cognitive process.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33217721/)\r  \n\r  \nLooking forward to your answers!",

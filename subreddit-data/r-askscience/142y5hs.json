An interstellar colonization mission where the full intent is that you will never have legitimate interaction with the humans that leave the solar system is about the limit of what I see being possible. So in terms of what's beyond asteroid mining and Moon/Martian colonies? Probably nothing. Colonies on other moons, etc but it all has to stay in the solar system.",

Technology able to traverse such absurd distances in any sort of timely fashion is so far away. But what if it wasn't?Let's imagine we have a magic rocketship that can accelerate to and from near lightspeed instantly without harming its occupants. Now let's say the closest system that had a planet viable for colonization was 20 light years away (extremely close, astronomically). Even though this trip would feel like taking seconds to minutes for those on board our magic ship, it still feels like it takes 20 years for those at Earth and at the other system. That's an inviolable law of relativity. And what about further systems? A system 500 light years away would be a 5 century jump in time each you visit it. 1000 years if you make a round trip. The only way around that is wormholes or teleporters but physics doesn't really like/allow for such things. Even if an Einstein-Rosen bridge is allowed under relativity how one would form, be maintained, and actually go to where you want it to is fantasy",

That's sad, but not quite as depressing as there simply never being technology to allow for long space voyages.",

And there are several issues involved in that, including power, fuel, life support, food, and the simple reason of \"why?\" It would provide no use to Earth, cost an absurd amount of money, and everyone leaving for the voyage would be fully aware they would die on the ship. Many generations would be born and die on the ship and there's a massive ethical quandary there. Not to mention what happens if you arrive at the system and find the planet isn't quite as hospitable as you thought? You'd also need ALL the supplies necessary to start a colony on the ship with you and if something is amiss when you arrive you're done for. That's it, no rescue.",

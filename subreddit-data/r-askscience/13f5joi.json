    "postText": "I've looked into what causes a moonbow. It's mainly water droplets in the air + clear skies + coming off or just before a full moon. I cannot seem to find a scientific answer for or against a moonbow being possible during a solar eclipse. Given its decreased brightness - I like to think the ghostly white \"rainbow\" similar to at night is not completely out of the realm of possibility. To wrap up my main question - given perfect conditions of the sun height, clarity of the sky, water droplets present in the air, etc. - is it actually possible to get the faint white moonbow during a solar eclipse?\n\nThanks!!",

So unfortunately no, you could not have a full moon during an eclipse, and thus no moonbow.\n\nInterestingly, however, there is at least [one documented case](https://opg.optica.org/viewmedia.cfm?r=1&amp;rwjcode=ao&amp;uri=ao-59-21-F1&amp;seq=0) of a conventional rainbow being observed before and during an eclipse. Right before totality was achieved, the rainbow lost all its visible color except for hydrogen-alpha red\u2026a deep red wavelength found among hydrogen spectral lines, briefly creating a very thin arc of only H-alpha red where the whole rainbow had just been. During totality, even the red disappeared and the entire rainbow was extinguished. You can read about this in the linked paper, or [you can read a firsthand account here](http://nicmosis.as.arizona.edu:8000/ECLIPSE_WEB/ECLIPSE_77/ECLIPSE_77.html).",

            "comment": "I might not be understanding the question, but moonlight (as you know) is just sunlight reflected off the moon. During a solar eclipse, no moonlight is visible from Earth, so a moonbow would be possible with the moon full or nearly full. Whether a rainbow is possible in the diminished light of a solar eclipse, I don't know. I would think it's conceivable under exactly the right circumstances.",

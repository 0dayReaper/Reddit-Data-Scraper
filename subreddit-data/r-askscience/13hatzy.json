In short the heat doesn't kill the pathogen, the immune system kills the pathogen and needs some extra heat to work more efficiently. \n\nEdit: made a small mistake in rembering and translating. In my memory it was division, but it should've been differentiation. This is an important difference, but the last sentence is correct. \n\nSource : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3206471/",

They also act as host immune response modifiers and play an essential role in treating infections in selected groups of patients, e.g., with mucoviscidosis or COVID-19.\n\n&gt;However, anti-inflammatory agents generally impair the immune system. NSAIDs inhibit granulocytes functions and enhance cytokines production, including TNF, and may contribute to the emergence of bacterial soft tissue infections or promote the development of the life-threatening disease from a minor infection, usually well-controlled by an immune system. Reducing infected patient's symptoms and signs of inflammation may provide a false sense of security and delay diagnosis of serious infections\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8496905/\n\nBasically, it's complicated, and kinda sorta but it's not something everyone should really worry about.

Yes, our treatment of Malaria has improved since then as well, but it's still worth mentioning considering how some of his early patients did die from live bacteria being used in the treatment. It wasn't until he changed the formulation to try different things that people stopped dying frequently from the bacteria (to be fair they were not far off from dying of cancer anyway so it's not entirely unethical to try it either with patient permission). I would assume that today we won't even have to use an infections agent, we could isolate what that agent is doing to cause cancer remission, and replicate it. I really do hope that more people dig back into this research and use it to the benefit of everybody, because it sounds like he was in fact absolutely right. He was also ridiculed for thinking that cancer was caused by an infectious agent, a theory that was widely disproven well past the time that he continued to hold it. Ironically he was partially right about that as well, some cancers do seem to be directly linked to viruses like HPV, and if HPV can do this, there are probably other infectious agents that can cause cancers as well which we haven't found yet. This is why science is ever-changing, and no idea should ever be completely discounted due to previous mounting evidence, since technology can change all of that due to new deeper understanding of how things work, and flip it right on its head.",

We encounter numerous infections on a daily basis but as long as the infection doesn\u2019t take a strong enough hold we\u2019re fine.",

You can sous vide chicken and keep it at an internal temperature that would be unsafe if you were to cook it in an oven, because time is a factor in killing pathogens, and by holding it at a lower temperature for a very long time you can kill them while the meat keeps the same properties. In the case of sous vide eggs they can be sterilized while the proteins are intact enough that they can be used the exact same way you'd use raw eggs. \n \nObviously the human body still never reaches temperatures high enough to sterilize itself with heat, but fevers last long enough that their impact on the metabolism of pathogens is considerable.",

We can be infected, but it's extremely unlikely to develop a full-fledged disease, worst case you'll get a nasty cut that will take a lot longer to heal than usual. Say, you cut a finger while tinkering with an infected aquarium... It usually isn't a big deal. But of course, we have our own types of tuberculosis that have no problems with our body temperature, which is a problem for us. But those types are different, and chances are you won't find them in fish. \n\nI also guess it should work both ways. We actually might be too cold for some pathogens that can be found in birds. Their metabolism is very fast, and I guess there are pathogens that rely on their high temperature to outrun immunity and proliferate. But we are colder, and that won't work.",

Which is more or less true if you only look at digestive enzymes but the idea that we developed the temperature to match the enzymes or cell growth is bogus. It's a two way street.  We use enzymes that match our temperature and stabilize our temperature to roughly match the optimum temperature for our cells and enzymes. \n\nInsect cells and enzymes work best at about 27C, some heat adapted extremophile bacteria use enzymes that are optimum at about 80-90C and they grow fastest at that temperature.\n\nThe major advantage of warm bloodedness, apart from a reliable boost to speed, strength and endurance at the cost of greater fuel consumption, is resistance to fungal infection.  Cold blooded animals are plagued by internal fungal infections which mammals and birds are mostly immune to. Mammals like bats suffer from fungal infections while they hibernate and lower their temperature almost to ambient.  It's hypothesized that fungal infections were a stronger pressure in evolving endothermy than the athletic advantages, otherwise we would maybe only selectively warm various muscle groups and organs the way tuna and white sharks do.",

It's essentially the same thing as when you cook or fry an egg, it changes and you can't change it back into being raw.\n\nAs for some places being hotter than the highest fevers, we are warm blooded animals, which means we have a constant body temperature and our body has many mechanisms to keep it that way. So if it's really warm outside you will sweat to cool down for example. And if you're in extreme heat for too long, well you can and will die from it, probably from dehydration or heat stroke (which is just the body failing to cool itself down)",

For one thing, temperature effects go both ways - viruses replicate worse at lower than optimal temperatures, as well as higher. That means that the relatively low temperature of humans makes it harder for avian viruses to infect them.  \n\n(It\u2019s likely that one side effect of that is that avian influenza viruses don\u2019t replicate well in the nose and throat, where temperatures are lower. They prefer to replicate in human lungs, where temperatures are higher.  That in turn probably means that avian viruses don\u2019t transmit as well, because they\u2019re not making virus where it can easily be shed, but also might mean that the disease they cause can be more severe.)\n\nBut on the other other hand, very typically these viruses will rapidly pick up mutations that adapt to the lower temperature of mammals. For example\n\n&gt;\tThe most often-observed and well-described mutation codes for a lysine instead of a glutamate at position 627 of the PB2 protein (PB2-E627K) and is solely sufficient for replication of several avian influenza viruses in mammals \u2026 It has been shown to increase transmissibility of avian viruses between mammals (118), presumably due to increased polymerase activity at lower temperatures, as found in the human upper respiratory tract (33 to 35\u00b0C) compared to the avian intestinal tract (38 to 40\u00b0C)\n\n-[Adaptation of Avian Influenza A Virus Polymerase in Mammals To Overcome the Host Species Barrier](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3700283/)\n\nI don\u2019t think anyone has asked specifically if these mutations make the virus less tolerant to fevers.  My guess is that it would, but there are too many variables (especially the location of infection, and also whether fever actually does much against non-opportunistic pathogens anyway) to make a confident statement. \n\nSo it\u2019s hard to generalize, because you\u2019re dealing with moving targets.",

Antibodies detect pathogen, chemical signals get sent to alert macrophage and other WBC, the entire process creates inflammation and ramps up the bodies metabolism=fever.",

Also it directly impairs and damages body cells.. basically none of your organs function as well. These are massive costs to pay at a time when the body already has to divert resources to fight infection. No chance this could evolve randomly with just zero penalty over evo time.",

Even cold-blooded creatures like lizards will bask in the sun more when infected with pathogens to get their body temperature higher.  Part of the reason bird flu is more lethal to humans is that the pathogen that causes bird flu is used to body temperatures much higher than normal human temperature.  In fact, they are used to temperatures that would kill us if we got such a high fever, so humans have to use a lot more resources fighting these pathogens in other ways with no help from the body temperature.",

(I know that the majority of submerging was due to rising sea levels, but it still survived in some shape or form before the tsunami). Can someone explain how this makes sense? Would the water not eventually recede? How can water permanently flood a place unless it\u2019s a basin? Seeing as doggerland is still like 20-30 meters underwater, surely it couldn\u2019t have survived as a basin for that deep under the sea level so close to the coast.",

            "comment": "Well, you're right, it wouldn't. A tsunami wouldn't *permanently* flood an area unless it was already a basin, or unless the tsunami did some kind of severe secondary damage (e.g., breaking open a natural dam and releasing or redirecting a bunch of other water).\n\nSome cursory research says that we think Doggerland - and anyone living there - was greatly affected by a tsunami but was already dealing with rising sea levels, and *more* rising sea levels are what finally buried it beneath the waves. The tsunami was just a bad time for anyone still living on the land that was left.\n\n(Incidentally, though, we can and do have areas near the coast sitting below sea level - you're right that it usually ends badly, but it does happen. Notably for those in the USA, half of New Orleans is currently \\~1-3 meters below sea level and sinking.)",

I remember reading that the 2011 Japanese tsunami dropped some parts of the island about 4 feet, which was coincidentally the safety margin built into the local tsunami defenses. Had that not happened those defenses might have worked better, but as it was the water rolled right over them.  This is obviously not what happened with Doggerland but I presume that some land in Japan is now flooded, coincidental with the tsunami but not because of it (strictly speaking).",

The tsunami can impact a coastline across an ocean but the effect of the fault movement on local uplift or down drop is more local, on the order of kilometers. Generally, if one side of the fault moves down, the other side moves up.",

                                    "comment": "The Japan side of the fault was experiencing upwarping because it was \"stuck\" on the subducting Pacific plate, causing the overriding plate to arch upwards over time. When the fault broke, the overriding plate that Japan is on flattened out (and that edge moved slightly forward). I don't know if Japanese authorities factored in the resulting subsidence of the overriding plate when figuring out how high to build coastal defenses.\n\n&gt;Generally, if one side of the fault moves down, the other side moves up.\n\nSubduction faults don't work that way. The subducting ocean floor moves forward relative to its normal movement, but of course must faster when the fault breaks. It's the sudden drop of the overriding plate that had been forced up for many years, as a result of being stuck on the subducting plate, that causes the tsunami waves to begin spreading out in all directions from above the drop in the seafloor.",

In the second sentence it does say \u201cthe tsunami caused\u201d but like the other commenter said it\u2019s clear from the prior sentence they meant the cause of the tsunami caused the land to drop not the actual tsunami. When he said \u201cthe tsunami\u201d he is referring to the wider event of the earthquake as well as the tsunami together. A common tool of figurative language called \u201cSynecdoche\u201d. Another example is referring to a worker as a \u201chired hand\u201d, you are not referring to just his hand but rather the whole person the hand is apart of.

Some stuff still gets washed away but nothing's replacing it, and the soil you do have is drying out and the organic stuff that was left decays and reduces down. It takes a while, but eventually you get air pockets in the ground, everything settles, and the overall area starts to sink.\n\nAlso not great: all this moving and rearranging of water and land has definitely helped New Orleans thrive, but it's done a number on the *surrounding* area too; the coast line's eroding, which is going to make that whole 'sea levels rising' business more of an issue, not to mention the nasty weather they get now and again.\n\nThese were problems noticed in the late 1890s.

Obviously, most notably is the impact on the rapidly eroding gulf coastline, but more locally, the safeguards built to protect New Orleans from flooding (higher levies, sea walls, etc.) now mean that the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain is the proverbial weak spot. So where flood waters would historically go to the south first and then spread more or less evenly around the lake, now they can\u2019t go south because it\u2019s so well fortified. This means massively larger amounts of flooding to the north and west post Katrina. Cat 2 and 3 storms have now caused historic flooding events in places like Mandeville, where in the past, Cat 4 or 5 storms would cause damage, of course, but nothing like the flooding we are seeing on a regular basis now.",

I.e., it argued that the island was *temporarily* submerged and then would have reemerged after the tsunami dissipated, but that rising seas would have fully submerged the island not that long after. Subsequently, further work however has questioned whether the tsunami actually full inundated the island (e.g., [Hill et al., 2017](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05593), [Walker et al., 2020](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/great-wave-the-storegga-tsunami-and-the-end-of-doggerland/CB2E132445086D868BF508041CC1B827)).\n\nIn a more general sense, in the absence of a coincident change in the elevation of an inundated area, the general expectation is that inundation by a tsunami will be temporary. There can be scenarios where a tsunami has sufficient run up to over top natural barriers and inundate low lying areas. In these scenarios, when most of the water recedes, the water in these low lying areas can remain until the water either evaporates and/or infiltrates, but these would still typically be ephemeral (i.e., temporary) features. In some hypothetical where a tsunami is able to also erode an area contiguous with the ocean to below sea level during the event, this could lead to a more permanent submersion.",

Doggerland was mostly soft sediment and mud flats so a huge tsunami could easily erode it. That said there\u2019s a ton of info about it on the wiki. \n\n&gt;\tAs ice melted at the end of the last glacial period of the current ice age, sea levels rose and the land began to tilt in an isostatic adjustment as the huge weight of ice lessened. Doggerland eventually became submerged, cutting off what was previously the British peninsula from the European mainland by around 6500 BCE. The Dogger Bank, an upland area of Doggerland, remained an island until at least 5000 BCE. Key stages are now believed to have included the gradual evolution of a large tidal bay between eastern England and Dogger Bank by 9000 BCE and a rapid sea level rise thereafter, leading to Dogger Bank becoming an island and Britain becoming physically disconnected from the continent.\n\n&gt;\tA recent hypothesis suggests that around 6200 BCE much of the remaining coastal land was flooded by a tsunami caused by a submarine landslide off the coast of Norway known as the Storegga Slide. This suggests \"that the Storegga Slide tsunami would have had a catastrophic impact on the contemporary coastal Mesolithic population ... Britain finally became separated from the continent and in cultural terms, the Mesolithic there goes its own way.\" A study published in 2014 suggested that the only remaining parts of Doggerland at the time of the Storegga Slide were low-lying islands, but supported the view that the area had been abandoned at about the same time as the tsunamis.\n\nThere\u2019s another theory as well.\n\n&gt;\tAnother view speculates that the Storegga tsunami devastated Doggerland, but then ebbed back into the sea, and that later Lake Agassiz (in North America) burst, releasing so much fresh water that sea levels rose over about two years to flood much of Doggerland and make Great Britain an island. The difference in distribution of broken shells between lower-lying and high-lying parts of the area also suggest survival of land after the Storegga tsunami.\n\n[Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doggerland?wprov=sfti1)",

A tsunami might wash people, villages, edible land plants and animals away and remodel small geographical features, so wipe entire populations out.  If the water levels were rising no one may move back in, so it might be the last time that land inhabited.  The tsunami would mark the end of the anthropological record.  I think this must be what that author meant.",

Wikipedia states... \"Another view speculates that the Storegga tsunami devastated Doggerland, but then ebbed back into the sea, and that later Lake Agassiz (in North America) burst, releasing so much fresh water that sea levels rose over about two years to flood much of Doggerland and make Great Britain an island. The difference in distribution of broken shells between lower-lying and high-lying parts of the area also suggest survival of land after the Storegga tsunami.\"",

For example \u2026\n\nDusky Canada geese nest principally on the Copper River Delta in Alaska and winter in the Willamette Valley, Oregon and along the lower Columbia River in south-west Washington and northwest Oregon. The Good Friday earthquake in 1964 elevated the delta 6-10 feet, resulting in the invasion of scrub-shrub habitat over much of the delta, and access by predators such as coyotes and brown bears. Consequently, the population began declining, subsiding below 10,000 by the mid to late 1980\u2019s.",

The waters won't recede from somewhere below sea level and something like a tsunami may overcome low natural barriers seperating the sea from lower areas.",

This lead to a massive rise in sea levels. The variance since then has been about 2 meters. \nLand levels can collapse and drop dozens of meters. This problem is effecting a lot cities in modern times and is mostly caused by over pumping of ground water and the erosion that follows.",

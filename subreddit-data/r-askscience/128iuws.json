    "postText": "I\u2019m currently working on my Masters thesis in the area of atomic filters for solar atmospheric observation. It\u2019s known that there are elements at varying heights in the solar atmosphere, such as sodium and calcium, but why? I presume it\u2019s from previous supernova explosions, which accrued in the solar atmosphere, but do we also know why they are at a particular height. For example neutral Ca is at about 1000 km above the solar surface in the chromosphere. Is there a particular reason for that height or is it random? Long post but appreciate any information!",

Astrophysics grad from 4 years ago, though, so I\u2019m mostly here to learn, myself.\n\nI imagine op isn\u2019t focusing on/can neglect the volatility at the surface, itself, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to learn, too.",

Tacking on to what I and u/mfb- said earlier, here are some plots: [https://imgur.com/a/ptR6Baq](https://imgur.com/a/ptR6Baq)\n\nThe first two show the temperature profile as a function of height. That drives the ionization state etc which determines emission lines. The third is from later in the book showing the results of calculations of the emission that makes it out of a star as a function of depth\\*, taking into account the attenuation etc.\n\nHighly recommend the book if you can find a copy online or in your library\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\* sort of",

It will produce carbon and oxygen in a few billion years, and only traces of heavier elements. None of that happens at the surface either.",

I.e., is sodium in there like a gradient or is it closer to a ring?\n\nI imagine the spacing between hydrogen and helium allow them to be pulled closer to the center of mass, but bigger nuclei (protons specifically) might catch more resistance from the strong forces, or from the amount of photons trying to escape, over powering the expectation of the denser element falling further down. Of course, I think I\u2019m wrong about something somewhere, but maybe this can help get you going",

The velocity of an element (molecule) is proportional to the temperature and inversely proportional to the mass; lighter elements naturally bump out to higher elevations than heavier elements.\n\nIt's been 30 years since I was taught this in a physics class so please find a better explainer than myself :)",

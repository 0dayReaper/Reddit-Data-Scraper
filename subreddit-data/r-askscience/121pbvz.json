    "postText": "Ok so I watched a video recently that explained how mushrooms use chitin as their structure, and it doesn't break down until 400C/750F. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyOoHtv442Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyOoHtv442Y)\n\nThat's quite hot, and most people don't have the ability to cook above those temperatures, sure. What happens if you did cook mushrooms hot enough to break down the chitin, though?\n\nI did some googling, didn't see anything, but feel free to link any articles that do answer the question.  \n\n\nEdit: The summary so far is that they would almost certainly burn if done in the presence of oxygen, and pressure cooking would take ridiculous amounts of pressure. Sounds like wrapping some in steel foil and putting them in a pizza oven could work?",

Pressure in an autoclave is at lower temperatures defined by the water pressure, so at 300 \u00b0C you get already around 40 bar of pressure. \n\nHydrothermal carbonisation means you get CO2 and H2O from your biomass from elimination reactions. And you get some coal like material as a main product and some short organic acids dissolved in water.\n\nThis works with all biomass.",

In AC, it is not straightforward to vary voltage, so other methods are used to reduce power (such as turning on/off very fast as mentioned by the above commenter, also known as Pulse Width Modulation).",

Many light makers intend their lights for use in toys, which is why they use both methods in the same LED, as it adds ways to control the patterns made.",

The marinades and fillings may have mushroom in them, but none of that means that they necessarily reach 400C (although it's possible -- what do I know?).\n\nThere are steakhouses I found searching that advertise food cooked in \"an 1800\u00b0[F] custom broiler ... served on a 500\u00b0 sizzling plate.\" A good plain charcoal grill can apparently reach 700F, and Beefer is/was a consumer grill that claims to consistently reach 1500F. All this is to say this should be possible for some redditor to test at home -- I don't see at a glance any recipes that grill mushrooms at a \"high temperature\" calling for exceeding 700F.",

While the ovens you suggest do exist for cooking, rarely does the food get to those temperatures. The temperature rise in the food is limited by the water within which boils off and keeps it cold (relative). 400C is likely above the auto-ignition temperature which just means it would just catch fire and burn before reaching 400C. \n\nFor reference, the auto-ignition temperature of cellulose is 250-300C.",

And I expect no sustained temperature of this level is necessary to get to the level to breakdown *some* of the molecules of chitin in this way.

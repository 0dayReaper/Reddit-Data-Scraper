    "postText": "So I know that X-rays are often made by the braking radiation of electrons, and since gamma rays are higher energy photons it strikes me that it should be possible to create gamma rays the same way. Though I would imagine that you would probably need heavier charged particles or significantly higher electron energies.",

The answer is \"yes\" l, one can make high-energy photons with Brem. This is, in fact, a common technique in nuclear physics to probe the response of nuclei to electromagnetic radiation. I do this myself at a facility called gammaELBE in Germany.",

The photon forming a kugelblitz would not be a limiting factor. \n\nWhat *might* be a limiting factor is the source of the bremsstrahlung photon. Any system capable of emitting bremsstrahlung necessarily has a rest frame, and therefore would form a black hole if massive enough, and the energy of the emitted photon comes from that system. If the emitted photon had enough energy to worry about a kugelblitz, then the system generating it would likely have already met the Schwarzschild condition to collapse into a black hole itself before radiating.",

The images look worse than those from a gamma-emitter, but it\u2019s good enough to see that the treatment went to the right place.",

            "comment": "Hey neat, this is the heart of my physics experiment!! Absolutely you can, you're really only limited by the energy of your electron beam. Until you start melting your target at least, but some targets can take some real punishment. You really wouldn't want to use other particle beams (protons, pions, muons, etc) to make bremstrahhlung photons, as lighter particles radiate waaaay more braking radiation, something like a trillion times more power for electrons compared to protons of the same energy.\n\nYou can even make a nice controlled beam of high energy gammas from bremsstrahlung for your particle physics experiment. You could even align it with the lattice of a diamond and get a polarized bremsstrahlung beam. My experiment, GlueX, does this up to about 11.5 GeV.\n\nIn short: yes, you can even do some fun science with those bremsstrahlung photons.\n\nEDIT: Oh interesting, thought x-rays meant anything around a few hundred keV, and gammas were anything more energetic. But I guess they're typically defined by source instead.  If x-rays=electron radiation and gammas=nuclear radiation then ignore me.",

Unless you're inciting pair-production after generating the bremsstrahlung, which you could claim to be producing two 511keV gamma rays from the annihilation event.",

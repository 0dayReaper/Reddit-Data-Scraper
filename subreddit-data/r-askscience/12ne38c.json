            "comment": "It's because, in general, bones lengthen from the ends very gradually, so the integrity of the shaft isn't affected by this process. You've probably heard people talk about the 'growth plate' with regard to bones - the growth plates are called epiphyses, and they're sort of like little caps on each end of the bone, separated from the shaft by a thin layer of cartilage. That cartilage is constantly being remodeled into bone, so it grows layer by layer, until the bone reaches full maturity, at which point the epiphysis fuses with the shaft. This fusing tends to happen in a specific order and at specific ages, which is why the age ranges for skeletons of people under the age of ~25 tend to be smaller and more specific than with adults who have reached skeletal maturity and all their bones are fully fused. \n\nWith that in mind, you can see why breaking a bone at one of the ends can cause issues in a younger person, because you can damage the epiphysis and affect the long-term growth of the limb, although I believe this is actually somewhat rare. Generally though, when you break a bone, once it's fully healed, there should be no loss of integrity because most people's bodies are capable of regenerating enough bone at the injury site that the integrity is the same as before. \n\nHaving said that, the bone *does* become weaker *during* the healing phase, but that's because the limb is typically completely immobilized with a cast, which causes atrophy of the muscles, which weakens the bone because it's not being subjected to forces that it needs to resist. It's the same reason why astronauts lose bone mass in space, because there's no gravity, so they're bones aren't working against as much resistance as usual. That's why, if you break a bone, it's important to do your physiotherapy once your cast is removed, because you need to rebuild the strength of the entire limb back to where it was before the injury.",

I thought mammalian bone had growth plates throughout the shaft which are only able to lengthen up to a certain point before fully ossifying. \n\nIt\u2019s reptiles that have bones that lengthen only from the 2 ends, allowing them to grow continuously throughout their entire lives.",

With severe injuries, for example a compound fracture where the bone breaks through the skin, it's not necessarily that bone is left weakened by the break itself, rather the damage to the surrounding soft tissues (muscle, cartilage, tendons) and nerves creates long-term issues in how a person is able use and move the limb. \n\nFor example, let's say you suffer a compound tib-fib fracture - think about all the muscles, tendons, and nerves that are in your lower leg along with the tibia and fibula. *All* of that is now probably pretty messed up, and all of it needs to be surgically repaired. You probably end up with pins and/or plates in your leg, and there's also the potential for nerve damage, muscle adhesions due to scar formation, etc. Your bone is actually probably going to heal itself pretty handily, but all of that other stuff tends to be more complicated, and will most definitely affect your ability to use the leg - plates on the bone might affect your mobility, which might change your gait, or nerve pain might cause you to favour the other leg because that's less painful. Your body will adapt to such small changes, but they'll have a systemic affect on the strength and mobility of the leg as a whole in the long term, so the entire leg, including the bone can end up weaker, but the weak point is not necessarily the point of the breakage itself.",

For bones its only the outer compact layer\n\n\"Compact bone (or cortical bone) forms the hard external layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity, or bone marrow. It provides protection and strength to bones. Compact bone tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian systems. Osteons are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and living osteocytes connected by canaliculi, which transport blood. They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone. Each osteon consists of lamellae, which are layers of compact matrix that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal. The Haversian canal (osteonic canal) contains the bone\u2019s blood vessels and nerve fibers (Figure 19.19\"\n\nhttps://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/19-2-bone/#:~:text=Compact%20bone%20(or%20cortical%20bone,called%20osteons%20or%20Haversian%20systems.",

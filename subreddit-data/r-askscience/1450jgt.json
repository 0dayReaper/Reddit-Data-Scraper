            "comment": "For some time, in modern physics, people taught the concept of \"relativistic mass\" which is what you're describing- mass increases as you speed up. This method of describing the phenomenon has really fallen out of favor, and most likely precisely because of misunderstandings it caused, for instance, questions like this (this is not meant as an insult to you or your question, but instead, a discussion about how this used to be taught very poorly). \n\nAn easy way to instantly know that this isn't the case- we know speed is relative, and there are no preferred reference frames (that is, you can't say definitively \"I am at rest, and you are moving.\" Any inertial (aka, non accelerating) frame is just as good as any other. So, that means, there is a valid frame in which you are moving at 99.999999999% the speed of light, and you are not a black hole, so obviously, moving close to the speed of light doesn't increase your mass to turn you into a black hole. \n\nSo, what is happening? It's much better to think of a relativistic momentum. Day-to-day we say \"momentum is equal to your mass times your velocity.\" Under relativity, momentum doesn't follow that equation, instead you can say:\n\n     p = m*v/sqrt(1-(v/c)^2)\n\nOr in words, momentum (p) is equal to your mass times your velocity, divided by this term, the square root of 1 minus your velocity, divided by the speed of light, squared. \n\nSo, a couple of things to notice. One, if your velocity is slow compared to the speed of light, then it essentially returns to the normal m\\*v equation. Two, that sqrt term is the same term that is in time dilation and length contraction. Third, and perhaps most important for understanding- that 'v' is the velocity as measured by some observer. The object going at 'v' won't measure his speed as some velocity- the traveler measures his own speed as 0, and instead measures things around him moving. So, this relativistic momentum is the momentum of an object *as measured by an outside observer.* Finally, it is tempting (and kind of intuitive) to say something like:\n\n    p = (m/sqrt(1-v/c)^2))*v\n\nand then call that first term, mass divided by the sqrt term, your \"relativistic mass.\" But that gets confusing, for the exact reason that people ask this question. Now, we say your mass is your \"rest mass\" and different observers will measure different momentums for objects, but they will all agree on the mass of the object.",

We used to teach something like this, but it ended up causing more confusion than it was worth (especially since it only works for the very simplest situations -- once you get to motion with acceleration, you can have different masses in different directions, which doesn't really make a whole lot of sense). The \"relativistic mass\" you're thinking about is just a relabeling of the total energy of an object, nothing more.\n\n&gt;My question is whether a human travelling near the speed of light collapse into a black hole due to the mass obtained by the increase in speed\n\nThis is part of why we stopped using \"relativistic mass\" as a concept -- total energy just doesn't behave like you would expect a mass to behave. So no, this doesn't happen.",

            "comment": "you do not gain mass at higher speeds. instead what happens is, as you get closer to the speed of light it becomes harder to gain extra speed. you become harder to push. When teaching physics, teachers used to explain this by saying \"your mass increases as you get closer to the speed of light because you gain a relativistic mass\". Intuitively this explanation kinda makes sense to us because obviously more massive objects are harder to push, thats why they explained it like this. But its a bad explanation that leads to misconceptions. The object doesnt actually gain mass. It is just harder to push as it gets closer to the speed of light.",

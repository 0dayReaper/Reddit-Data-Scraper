    "postText": "Wife and I were discussing whether trees could \"feel\" in their own way or not, and how a tree \"reacts\" to squirrels or birds clawing up the bark, and I'm under the impression that plants don't really use electricity to signal like we do, and instead use mostly chemical signaling and mechanical \"call and response\" style reactions that plants barely are aware (for lack of a better word). How off am I in this?",

            "comment": "Not like nerves, no, though they do have some electrophysiological communication. It's much less specialized than neuronal signaling.\n\nThey also rely on a rich repertoire of hormonal signals. Some of their hormones can travel through the air, and facilitate communication between different plants. \n\nOthers are more similar to ours, just transported in xylem and phloem instead of blood etc. Your perfect conical Christmas tree illustrates it well - the tip of the tree produces a hormone called auxin, which inhibits growth of side branches. The branches get longer as you go down the tree, because less of the auxin reaches those parts of the tree.",

Does auxin actually inhibit branch growth after they have started growing?",

            "comment": "Plants use some control methods that don't really have corollaries in animals.  The big one that springs to mind is *pressure*.\n\nWheat plants roll up their leaves to reduce surface area under drought stress.  This also concentrates their stomata in a higher humidity microclimate inside the rolled leaf, allowing them to exchange gasses and photosynthesize with less water loss.\n\nThey don't need to send a signal to accomplish this.  When the roots can't find the water they need, the turgor pressure inside the plant drops, and with it reduced the leaves automatically withdraw into a defensive rolled shape to reduce water loss.",

            "comment": "Venus fly traps do not have neurons but they do contain sensory receptors that have ion channels that generate action potentials containing information. There was recently a publication in nature illustrating the use of electrical currents to force the fly trap to shut. So, yes, plants *can* use electricity, to do stuff, but in the spirit of your question, no those signals are probably not working in the same way as electrical impulses carried by nerves in Animals.",

On a cell level that is a large increase in metabolic load compared to homeostasis, but when you look at the energy balance of the whole organism is it actually substantial? [This paper](https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpendo.1998.275.2.e249) suggests that the brain, liver, lung, heart and kidney are responsible for the vast majority of resting energy expenditure. There may be an increase in heart rate when one is sick, but for the most part those organs will probably not change their metabolic loads appreciably. Just curious if you know any studies that have tried to quantify this.",

    "postText": "In my experience, the radio/microwave range is generally described with frequency (e.g. WiFi is said to be 2.4 GHz). Infrared/Visible/Ultraviolet is generally described with wavelength (e.g. sunlight peaks around 500 nm). X-Rays/Gamma Rays are commonly described with photon energy (e.g. the Compton telescope observes a range from 20 keV to 30 GeV).\n\nHow/when did these general conventions arise, and why don\u2019t we describe the whole spectrum using the same terminology?",

            "comment": "Radio waves are defined with Mhz and Ghz, because electronics use Herz for clock speeds, and in the early days of radio frequency (before microwaves) these waves were predominantly made by electronics.\n\nHigh-energy waves like x-rays and gamma are similarly defined by the field they mostly serve. Gamma is almost exclusively used in particle physics, where energy and specifically electron-volt, is front and center of almost any discussion.\n\nVisible light or near visible light was mostly studied in optics at first, where wavelength is a major property (light bends differently at different wavelengths). Of course Herz could work here as well, but the term wavelength predates Herz, and optics predates... Anything almost",

These give wavelength directly without needing to know the speed of light. ( Prisms were also used, but their dispersion had to be calibrated with known wavelengths.) \nRadio waves were created and received by circuits that have a resonant frequency determined by known capacitance, inductance and resistance.",

            "comment": "We use energy in the X-ray/gamma-ray range because frequencies get impractically high and wavelengths impractically short to actually measure. For the rest of the spectrum, wavelength and frequency are sometimes more interchangeable. For example, you hear about \"the terahertz gap\" in the far infrared, and many ham radio bands are denoted in terms of wavelength (for example, the \"2-meter band\", the \"80-meter band\", etc.). There's also the \"21cm line\", used to describe a certain astrophysical radio source with that wavelength, and \"millimeter-wave radar\" which has a wavelength around that scale.",

            "comment": "I think it's a fair starting point to suggest that the common description likely sticks from what was most directly measured when the radiation was first discovered or found popular application.\n\nLight wavelengths can be measured pretty straightforwardly with diffraction experiments or perhaps interferometers. We don't have equipment (certainly not at any affordable price) that can measure the frequency of light directly.\n\nThese days digitally-synthesised radio transmitters and receivers mean we can generate and receive signals up to several gigaHertz from (lower frequency) crystal frequency standards - so we measure the frequency pretty directly.\n\nFor conventional X-ray tubes, you need actual kV of power supply a little greater than the characteristic radiation in keV of the X-ray tube target.",

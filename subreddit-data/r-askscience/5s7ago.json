I don't know where you're getting the impression that inflation isn't taken seriously from, but it is not true. Recent Planck data actually has given very good evidence for inflation.\n\n(edit) Arguably, all of science is just 'kicking the can'. There can never be a fundamental explanation for any phenomenon that doesn't itself rely on underlying mechanism that 'just are'. That said, inflation does more than just kick the can. It solves problems such as the horizon and flatness problem and the relic abundance problem, and makes predictions such as scale invariance, and certain parameters measured in the CMB, that are backed by observational data and that can't be explained without it. It has its flaws for sure, but to dismiss it as merely 'kicking the can' is giving it far less credit than it currently has in mainstream cosmology.",

His original work on inflation was him trying to solve the magnetic monopole problem by introducing a period of supercooling. It was after this, when he discovered that this supercooling would lead to quasi-exponential expansion, that he realised his work also solved the horizon and flatness problems. This exponential expansion isn't as contrived as it sounds. In fact, if you have some decent maths skills you can derive it yourself: take the friedmann equation, solve for constant energy density, and you'll almost immediately find that you get exponential expansion. That's all inflation requires: a scalar field with a flat potential. \n\n&gt;  it's a theory falling ever more out of favor\n\nWhere are you getting this from? \n\n&gt;it postulates a mystery field with a mysteriously convenient potential energy curve\n\nOne of the most promising models at the moment is Higgs inflation, which provides the exact sort of potential required with only minor modifications to the standard model (a non-minimal coupling of the Higgs field to gravity). The predictions of this model is in excellent agreement with recent Planck data. Other models can also naturally achieve the required potential (although I don't know much about them). \n\n&gt;creating the new problem of absurdly specific initial conditions. \n\nThere are many different models of inflation that deal with this problem. More generally though, eternal inflation is a feature of many models, and can provide a solution by allowing for a range of initial conditions, with inflation only occurring in areas of the multiverse where the conditions allow for it.

You can make projections based on the expansion rate of the universe and the speed of light as constants.](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2012/10/how-large-is-the-observable-universe/)  \n\n\nSome of the non-constant variable accounted for include the shape of the universe, which is currently unknown, though I believe it is still considered flat in the most commonly accepted model. One model has us as being within a surface layer existing on the outer edge of a super-duper massive black hole. They go all over the place.\n\n&gt; Since the primordial burst of creation, space has been stretching as the universe expands. A galaxy\u2019s distance from us today is far greater than it was when it released the light. We can think, by analogy, of a relay race in which a girl tosses a ball to her teammate and then runs away from him. If the coach later asks the teammate what is the farthest throw he has caught he would give a very different answer than if he is asked where is the farthest player he has caught a ball from. Similarly, the distances traveled by the photons hurled by light sources do not reflect the much greater extent of the sources\u2019 current positions. Thus, we could potentially observe light sources that are much farther out than 13.75 billion light-years, if their light was released when they were close enough to Earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yet another factor that expands the limit of the observable universe is its acceleration. Not only is the universe expanding; its growth has been speeding up. Data from the Hubble Space Telescope, the WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) satellite and other instruments have been used to pin down the rate of acceleration, along with the current expansion rate, the age of the universe, and other important cosmological parameters.\n\n**[The full Universe is projected to be *at least* 250x larger than the observable universe.](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/422579/cosmos-at-least-250x-bigger-than-visible-universe-say-cosmologists/)**",

Even a single proton whose size is about 8.4 -8.7 x 10^-16 m are closer in size to the meter than the observable universe. The Planck length is just so absurdly small. \n\nInteresting to note the Planck mass is much much closer to the Kg than the estimated mass of the observable universe (~21x10^-6 g as opposed to ~10^55 g)",

For instance, before we discovered the atom, did our understanding of celestial bodies make us believe that we were closest to the smallest thing in the universe, or was out understanding of celestial bodies limited to about the same scale?\n\nDoes that make any sense?",

You can only conceive of two dimensions, so you can only observe the surface of the balloon. To you, it appears to be getting larger and larger. But what is it expanding into? If you don't consider a third dimension, it makes no sense.\n\nYour problem is that you're looking at it with the mindset of a balloon-being. If the universe is constantly expanding, where is it expanding into? The question makes no sense. The universe is expanding, but in four dimensions. We just happen to only be able to observe three of them. Just like the balloon-being, we can't conceive of what this extra dimension would look like, but we know it must exist because it's the only way it makes sense for our universe to be finite but at the same time getting larger.",

At some point, the speed of spacetime expansion is greater than the speed of light. Thus, information from beyond that boundary will never be able to reach us. What is beyond will never be known: infinite, immeasurable, or just stops right there--whatever the answer is, we will never be to able to verify any theory.\n\nI am merely a cosmological layman but I don't think anyone has any remotely correct answer about this. In fact, I am not sure why so many commenters are disputing that it can be infinite in extent past the boundary, because we just don't know. [u/KilleryCunton](https://www.reddit.com/user/KilleryCunton) suggests that the math works out better for a finite universe, but without any evidence to test the model against, it's as equally likely to be infinite as finite, I think.",

The logs are about 26.94 and -35.80; so the middle is 10^-8.86 = 1.38 * 10^-9 meters.  But 0.1 millimeters is 10^-4 meters.\n\nHave I flubbed the calculations or are you using a different \"size of the observable universe\" estimate?",

That means the planck length is believed to be the shortest theoretically measurable length. It has no other physical significance.",

In plank units, one planck time for example is equal to 1 plank length over the speed of light, where one plank length is equal to the root of \u0127G/c. \n\nThis can be useful in many situations. For example, the gravitational force between two objects is the product of their masses, times G, over the distance: F = G M m /r^2. The gravitational force between two plank masses at one plank length is thus one plank force, 1x1x1/1^2 = 1.",

There are various theories of cosmology and high energy physics that suggest some \"things\" that are that small, though. If I remember right, they include, in various contexts that I don't understand very well:\n\n* The spatial \"grid\" on which our universe is built; i.e. it's the smallest distance anything can move or be measured. If you move forward, or back or left or right or whatever, you always move one Planck length or more (basically always more for actual objects we know about or interact with). If you \"move less than one Planck length\", you don't move. \n\n* [Strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length) in string theory are often considered to be somewhere close to the Planck length.\n\n* There are some theories of quantum gravity that have it represent the minimal size of a black hole, or something. I've also vaguely heard about sub-microscopic black holes that spontaneously appear and disappear due to random quantum fluctuations, which might be on the order of the Planck length, and something about how if you probe below the Planck length everything is basically indistinguishable from a black hole due to the density of information/energy/whatever you want to call it.\n\nKeep in mind these bullet points are my very uneducated description of extremely speculative and exotic physics, so it could be all nonsense. And I'm sure there are other objects that are discussed which related to the Planck length that I just don't know about. I work in condensed matter physics, and the only reason we generally talk about the Planck length is to say \"hey a proton is like 10^19 times bigger than this\". ",

                                    "comment": "&gt; All these things are basically just areas where physicists don't really understand what's going on.\n\nIt'a a bit more nuanced than that. It is true that we can't really answer the question \"what happens at length scales shorter than the Planck length\", what happened before the universe was one Planck time old\", etc. However, it's not quite as simple as saying we don't really understand, as if we could just build a bigger accelerator (or equivalently a smaller \"ruler\"), or work a little harder and find the answer. \n\nThe Planck length is the approximate length that's derived simply by multiplying some universal physical constants. It's expected that our existing understanding of length, energy, gravity, information, etc become basically irrelevant at length scales near this. It is a pretty broad theoretical concept that applies differently to different topics in physics, but it's entirely possible that the notion of a length shorter than the Planck length, or a time shorter than the Planck time, or whatever, simply doesn't exist as we understand it. It's similar to the uncertainty principle in that regard (and is closely related to it). The uncertainty principle says that a particle simply *does not have* a well-defined position if its momentum is well-defined. It's not \"maybe here, maybe there, we just don't know\", it's not \"everywhere\", its position is simply undefined. And vice versa. And the probabilistic theory of quantum mechanics, from which this is derived, is very well-documented and mathematically and experimentally proven to have no [\"local hidden variables\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell's_theorem), meaning that the problem is not that there's a \"hidden\" position and we don't know how to measure it, but that the position really doesn't exist (until it's measured, which brings us to a very very long and complicated discussion of measurement in quantum mechanics that I don't have time to get into). Caveat: non-local hidden variables are not disproved, but such theories would require us to demolish our notion of causality in a way that is really scientifically unappealing.\n\nOf course some parts of our existing understanding could be wrong, and there's a lot we simply don't understand, as you suggested. I just get hung up about these sorts of things and don't want people to read your comment thinking that this is just a matter of linear progression similar to the late 20th-century progress in making smaller computer chips or something like that.",

            "comment": "What is your criterion for \"closer\"?\n\nIt is tempting to conflate exponents with averages. We are tempted to think that, for example, on a scale of 10^1 to 10^12, the \"middle\" is somewhere near 10^6 or 10^7. That because 6 and 7  are halfway between 1 and 12, the same applies to powers of 10.\n\nThis is a fallacy, because on the scale of 1 to one trillion, \"halfway\" is 500 billion, or ~ 10^11.698970004336019.\n\nWolfram Alpha computes the diameter of the observable universe (OU) to be approximately 5.4e61 Planck lengths. Given 162 cm as the average human height, this is equivalent to about 1e35 Planck lengths. This means 5.4e25 humans equals one OU. \n\nIf you are just wanting to compare absolute size the OU dwarfs everything by several orders of magnitude; The 'jump' from 10^60 to 10^61 is much, much larger than the jump from 10^34 to 10^35, because ten 10^60's is equal to 100,000,000,000,000,000 10^34's. From this point of view, humans are much closer to the 'yoctoscopic scale' than to the 'cosmological scale'. The 10^25 that stretches between human scale and the cosmos has more 'weight' than the 10^35 that lies between humans and the Planck length.\n\nBut if you are looking purely at orders of magnitude and the change of scale that comes with rising exponents, then humans are closer to the 'cosmological scale' being 10^-25 th of a universe, than to the 'yoctoscopic scale' where Planck lengths are 10^-35 th of a human.",

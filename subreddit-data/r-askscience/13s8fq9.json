            "comment": "You're right that air temperature can be seen as a measure of how much kinetic energy the air molecules have. But, our skin also has its own temperature. The molecules in our cells are vibrating as well.\n\n  \nWhen our skin is exposed to air, what's happening is a bunch of elastic collisions between our skin molecules and the air molecules. Energy will be transferred in each collision: the air molecule will end up moving either faster or slower after the collision, either taking or giving energy to the skin molecule. Which happens in any given collision is random. However, on average if all the skin molecules are moving very slowly, most of the time the air molecule will impart energy to the skin.. and on average if all the skin molecules are vibrating very quickly, most of the time the skin molecule will impart energy to the air. As energy is transferred, the temperature of both skin and air will change. Eventually, even though on each collision there will still be either energy gained or lost, on average there will be no further energy transfer - the two surfaces will reach thermal equilibrium, both at the same temperature.\n\n  \nOur nerve endings are really sensing the temperature of our skin, not the temperature of the air. In cold air, the skin will be cold, and in hot air, the skin will be hot. As skin temp rises, the molecules inside the nerve endings will be vibrating and jostling faster. Chemical reaction rates change inside the nerve ending as the temperature rises or cools, and the nerve is set up to detect those changes and communicate what's happening back to the brain.",

            "comment": "I think it's more precise to say that we don't feel temperature, but rather heat transfer.  If your skin is hotter than the environment you're in, you feel cold.  And how cold you feel is based on the rate of heat transfer.\n\nIt's why wind chill makes you feel colder even though the air temperature isn't changing, because your body is losing heat faster.\n\nSame with why cold water feels colder than cold air, it's pulling heat away from you faster than air can and so feels colder.",

                    "comment": "Sorry, no, that is less precise. We have nerve endings that directly sense temperature. These neurons sense temperature using [thermosensitive ion channels](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Thermoreception_2.png/1920px-Thermoreception_2.png) that open above (or below, depending on the channel) a characteristic temperature, which in turn activates the neuron they're embedded in and sends a signal to your brain.\n\nThe temperature that we're sensing with these thermosensitive ion channels is generally our skin temperature. Skin temperature is usually somewhere between our body's core temperature and our environment's temperature. Where our skin temperature sits between these two points depends on (a) the thermal conductivity from our skin to the environment, and (b) the thermal conductivity from our core to our skin. Both of these conductivities are highly variable. In air on a windless day, (a) will be much lower than if your skin is against a large plate of aluminum, so aluminum at 15\u00b0C can feel colder than air at 10\u00b0C. But (b) variability is also significant; as your core temperature drops (say, 36.8\u00b0C instead of 37.0\u00b0C), your hypothalamus directs your body to conserve heat by reducing blood flow to your extremities and your skin, which can drop your hand skin temperature from e.g. 35\u00b0C down to 25\u00b0C. This will also make you feel cold, even though it *reduces* the thermal flux through your hand.\n\nThe issue is further complicated by the fact that downstream neural circuits tend to inhibit and ignore constant signals ([adaptation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_adaptation)), which makes it *seem* like you're feeling the first derivative of skin temperature (i.e. heat transfer), but you're not. You're still feeling temperature, just with diminished sensitivity if the temperature is constant.",

            "comment": "That isn't exactly how things work.  Energy drives chemical reactions.  Nerve signals are a form of chemical reaction that converts into an electric signal (electrochemical signal) and creates a new reaction from that electrical energy at some distant location.  The arrival of such signals causes changes to happen at that distant location.  \n\nCells and the surrounding liquids will always react to energy by an alteration in the chemical rates and processes.  Stable forms change as conditions change.  Chemical reactions proceed, can even change direction (what is usually stable and made by the body becomes unstable and gets destroyed by the body).  The system is very complex and actually pretty sensitive to change in many ways.\n\nWe don't really have nerve cells tuned to \"fire\".  We have nerve cells sensitive to heat energy (other cells are more tuned to pressure or impact energy, and so on).  Even very primitive life with rudimentary nervous systems respond to temperature changes. That is, even down at the very level of complex life, a benefit exists to being able to \"recognize\" heat.  Things that respond to abnormal heat by running away tend to survive, and their offspring retain that systematic response.  500 million years of evolution isn't going to change that basic idea much.  Maybe in detail, but not in general idea.\n\nAlthough nerves can gain energy by direct contact with excited air molecules, a lot of the energy is actually transferred as light (the cells and surroundings absorb energy emitted by the heat source, rather than by direct conduction through contact with the heat source).  Most people can \"feel\" where the heat source is even when blindfolded, which warmed air won't provide (air will be well-mixed and at similar temperature everywhere so no clear direction of origin is identifiable easily).  \n\nOur nerves do not really know the difference between a hot fire, sunlight at midday, or a nearby electrical lamp that is providing heat and light.  Our cells just react to the heat energy, generating a series of chemical processes that our body eventually responds to.   The body mostly responds to change, not to the particular signal.  Change means something potentially concerning is happening.  \n\nThe pain of cell death and flesh destruction is not the same as the reaction of heat-sensitive cells to nearby heat sources.  Contact burns are a lot less about heat and much more about destruction; more direct pain and a lot less warning signs.  Heat though, if applied slowly with time, can go unnoticed for quite a long time before other things, like pain, bring attention to it.",

The process chambers have to pump down for a while, because gas gets ~~stuff~~ stuck to surfaces inside, and inside the metal itself.\n\nThat and gas can sometimes penetrate even metal, just straight through. Not at a high rate. And not the chunkier gas molecules.\n\nIt's definitely not as pronounced as solids sticking to things though.",

            "comment": "I think part of this comes down to perception.  Because solids are, well, solid.  If the atoms/molecules on one side of a solid object are stuck to something, the rest of the solid object is stuck to it too.  If you press tape down on to some shredded pieces of paper, the paper pieces will stick to it.  You can easily see that they are sticking, because whole pieces of paper are big enough to easily see.  But the actual adhesion is happening only in the parts of the paper directly touching the tape, which you can't really see.\n\nLiquids and gasses can similarly adhere to surfaces, but they don't have big solid objects hanging off of them.  So if a layer adheres to the surface, but the bulk of the liquid or gas remains free of it (unlike the bulk of a scrap of paper, which remains attached to the stuck-on part).  That means you can't easily _see_ the stuck on part, because it's just on a molecular scale.  Although you actually _can_ often see liquids stuck on things.",

            "comment": "Here is a simplified explanation:\n\nIf materials themselves are \"sticky\" they stick to themselves strongly as well and hence don't form gasses or even liquids (without adding heat).  So inherently, if something is a gas, it tends not to be very \"sticky\" (i.e. strongly interactions with other atoms).  Think nitrogen.  No dipole, nothing to stick to any other molecule or even  itself .  Hence it is a gas, hence it doesn't \"stick\" easily to other materials.",

Conventional adhesives usually just adhere through intermolecular forces (disclaimer: some can form chemical bonds with their substrates, like certain epoxies and glass). Intermolecular forces are the same things that determine state of matter (solid/liquid/gas). Of course, non-ideal gases (polar molecules and heavy molecules, like maybe molecular weight 100+ g/mol - not common gases like dry air) are still affected by intermolecular forces, so may actually attach to adhesives pretty well even in gas state, depending on exact structure and properties.",

They do not break down in water.\n\nIf you put duct tape in acetone\u2026 you\u2019ll see a lot less \u2018phobic\u2019 happening\ud83d\ude02 because those are things that can be \u2018sticky\u2019 towards each other, to the point of breaking each other down.\n\nAthough another reason things can be sticky is because of pressure and the way things grab onto each other- which requires pressure for it to work. You cant \u2018press/apply pressure\u2019 to liquids with duct tape like you can to a surface. No pressure, no grab, no stick.\n\nSilicone needs to be applied with pressure as well. If you just roll a bead onto a surface it\u2019ll be on there for a bit but then the only \u2018pressure \u2018 to connect it to the surface is gravity and the weight of itself and how porous the surface is, which isnt much.",

            "comment": "The original planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, could all be seen with the naked eye.\n\nWhen you followed their path across the night sky, night after night, they seemed to take a different path than the stars. They were \"wandering stars\" - which, in Greek is \"asteres planetai.\"\n\nThese were the planets for thousands of years. In the 1540s, we moved towards the idea of Earth actually being one of them - and all of them orbiting the sun.\n\nAs telescopes and mathematics were used to find Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, it was easy to just plop them onto the list.\n\nBut by 2006, we were finding tons of planet-like objects out near Pluto - as well as a bunch of planets around other stars. We needed a better definition. The old \"planet\" concept was no longer narrow enough. We'd have 100s, if not thousands of planets in our solar system if we kept with the old concept.\n\nSo it was agreed in 2006 to adjust the definition to three simple bullets.\n\nEssentially: orbit a star, have enough gravity to pull yourself round, and be the main gravitational object in your orbital space. Pluto fails the third bullet and was hence removed from the list.",

People began discovering lots of planets whose orbits lay between Mars and Jupiter, to the point there were so many that we decided to create a new classification \"asteroid\", and remove them from the list of planets. So there's precedent to decide that something which was considered a planet is actually part of another group of bodies.",

I was comparing Ceres's size (\\~588 mile diameter) to Pluto's (\\~1,477 mile diameter).\n\nOh, and more fun stuff.\n\nGanymede (Jupiter III) and Titan (Saturn VI) are larger than Mercury.  Callisto (Jupiter IV), Io (Jupiter I), Moon (Earth I), Europa (Jupiter II), and Triton (Neptune I) are all larger than Pluto.  We're not going to list everything from Pluto to Ceres - too many.\n\nThough I feel like a boom of large, nearly planet-sized objects was in the early 2000s, including Eris.  9 objects floating in the 500+ mile diameter after 2000 that aren't moons.",

While they still seem to orbit around the earth (or rather a line extending out from the poles in both directions), their motion moves forward or backwards (retrograde) relative to the other stars at different times.\n\nThis is because they are actually orbiting around the same star that the earth is. So they aren't always in the same place in the night sky. Their retrograde motion occurs when the earth's orbit is lined up on the same side of the solar system as a slower orbiting planet (or the opposite side of a faster moving planet) and vice versa.\n\nEarly astronomers didn't \\*know\\* what the planets were, only that they wandered.

            "comment": "There is a long history of the use of the word planet and most people do not realize quite how modern our everyday use of the word is.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nPrior to the Copernican revolution in 1610 there were seven planets which included the Sun and the Moon (and at this point the Earth was included as a planet). Post Copernican revolution the Sun was no longer considered a planet and instead was considered a \"fixed star\". However, even at this time the Moon, as well as other moons in the solar system, were considered planets.  Indeed Huygens (1659) and Cassini (1673) classified the moons of Saturn as planets while Herschel (1787) classified the moons of Uranus as planets. Further, Kepler introduced the terminology of primary planet and secondary planet (what we now call planets and moons). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAt this time scientists believed comets were larger than primary planets and hence were also were called planets. Indeed, Newton discussed how primary planets, secondary planets, and comets can change over time into one of the other forms of planet. What this highlights is that at the time scientists recognized planets as dynamics objects which can change in time. As such they classified many things to be planets which they believed formed from each other or from the same progenitor.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nSo, what changed? Well scientists got a little lazy and in the 1800s folk taxonomy started to rise. By folk taxonomy what we are referring to is the general public. A quote from the time \"The moon, commonly regarded as a mere satellite of the earth, is in truth a planet, the least member of that family of five bodies circling within the asteroidal zone, to which astronomers have given the name of the terrestrial planets.\" - Proctor 1880. Scientists failed to fight back against the influence of astrology and theology who desired the planets to be static and orderly, in contrast with the scientific acceptance that such objects were dynamic in nature. What made things worse was the 1910-1955 planetary science depression where there was a 62% reduction in planetary science output. This allowed for folk taxonomy to take hold in educational materials and then by 1960 in the scientific literature.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nBy the time planetary science took off again in the 1960s folk taxonomy had fully taken over from the scientific terminology. In fact, even the IAU definition of planet has more in common with folk taxonomy than rigorous science. \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nFor a full review and history of the definition of planet, which included what went on at the general assembly and why the IAU definition is inadequate, see [Metzger et al. 2022](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0019103521004206).",

Their discoverers had been looking for a missing planet and named them, naturally, planets. Wilhelm Herschel cricitised that, pointing out that these bodies were so small they didn't appear as discs even in his super-telescope, and he suggested the term \"asteroids\", signifying \"star-like dots\" (Alexander von Humboldt opted for \"pocket planets\" instead but wasn't heard). This provoked loud boo's from his colleagues who suggested Herschel did that only because he wanted to stay the only astronomer who had discovered a REAL planet (Uranus). But even when after a hiatus of some decades the number of known asteroids started to grow abundant, the first four were still reckoned as distinct planets for a long time, bringing the total number to 12 (including Neptune). Yet eventually they were demoted, much like Pluto was in 2006, but without anyone paying attention to it - none of them had been discovered by an American, after all.\n\nIronically, (1) Ceres has such passed the most complex history of them all: initially classified as a comet by its discoverer, then as a planet by his contemporaries, then demoted to asteroid (or planetoid), and finally upgraded to dwarf planet. And it's still open whether or not it is not really a stray KBO.",

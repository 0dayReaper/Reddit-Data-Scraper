The Rockies push colder air to extreme elevations and that layer then covers the warmer air covering the great plains at lower elevations.  When the warmer air punches a small hole through the layer of cooler air, it rises unchecked creating the funnel cloud.\n\nWithout this \"layering\" some water spouts or small tornados are possible, just not real probable.",

I stated that there WERE some tornados and waterspouts across the globe (or flat surface of the earth if yer one of those), but I see I didn't specifically state they were typically weaker (they are) due to the aforementioned topography.\n\nThey are much, much more prevalent and typically much more powerful. The rest of the world doesn't see tornados above an F2 very often.\n\nCompare the USSR-8 tornados in 2022 only one hit the F3 mark,  to the US with 1331 tornados.  The report I found on the US count didn't have the strength, but I know of at least 4 so far this year, that were F3 or higher fairly close to me.",

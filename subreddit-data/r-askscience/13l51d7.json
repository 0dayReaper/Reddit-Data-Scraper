    "postText": "I have some friends in Northern California that live near Chester, CA. They have been having a lot of earthquakes recently. They have had 95 earthquakes in the last 7 days according to this [website](https://earthquaketrack.com/us-ca-chester/recent). They are getting pretty concerned and I haven't seen any big news stories about it. They are close to Lake Almanor and Mt. Lassen. Could this be a lead up to Mt. Lassen erupting?",

            "comment": "&gt; Could this be a lead up to Mt. Lassen erupting?\n\nAlmost certainly not. While certain types of earthquakes and other seismic events (e.g., [harmonic tremors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_tremor)) can definitely be indicative of magma moving (and thus be useful signals in concert with other measurements we makes as part of [volcanic monitoring](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/VHP/comprehensive-monitoring-provides-timely-warnings-volcano-reawakening)) and in turn warn of *possible* eruptions, importantly; (1) tectonic earthquakes and volcanic earthquakes are relatively easy to distinguish from each other and (2) in this case, all of the seismicity in question are [aftershocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftershock) from the clearly tectonic [M5.5 event](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/nc73886731/executive) that occurred on May 11, 2023. \n\nWhile it's understandable that folks in the area are worried, especially given blatant clickbait articles floating around suggesting a possible link between these earthquakes and an eruption of Lassen (which I won't link to, since they're unfounded nonsense), this particular 5.5 event (and thus the aftershocks it has produced) is clearly tectonic as opposed to volcanic (e.g., [this brief statement from the USGS](https://twitter.com/USGSVolcanoes/status/1656811704406122496?s=20)). While it's obviously too recent for there to be much in the way of published work, there's plenty of good information out there on the tectonic context of this event and similar events (e.g., the M5.7 event that happened on effectively the same fault system in 2013). For example [this visualization of the fault plane](https://twitter.com/ALomaxNet/status/1657764853505728516?s=20) or this [this write up and graphics](https://earthjay.com/?p=11082) from a geologist who works for the California Geological Survey.",

Furthermore the magma may be more fluid or more solid, and be carrying more or less gas.

The key points here is that we typically think about triggering being potentially important when the generative earthquake is relatively large (which this earthquake is not) and when the seismic waves from said earthquake interact with a volcano that is already effectively primed and near ready for eruption (which there's not any clear indication that the magmatic system at Lassen is near an eruptable state).",

In short, I don't have a lot of free time. \n\nHowever, because I'm interested in countering misconceptions about the earth sciences, I devote a small bit of time to answering reddit questions while I'm drinking my morning coffee or taking a quick break from other stuff or bored out of my mind during zoom call number 5 of the day, etc. All of this is to say, I'm not agonizing over my prose while answering reddit questions, I'm not going to start agonizing over my prose while answering reddit questions, and frankly it's nit-picky comments like yours that enter my inbox that makes me question why I spend anytime here and think I'd be better served spending my vanishingly small free time reading a book, watching paint dry, or really anything but being here on reddit.",

Lassen Peak has already had two eruptive episodes, when it was forming 27,000 years ago, and then again 1914-1917. For it to erupt a third time I think would be exceedingly unusual. That's not to say that something in the park or surrounding area won't erupt, but if/when it does, it almost certainly wouldn't be Lassen Peak itself. For whatever that's worth.",

Lassen Peak as well as other volcanoes in the Pacific Northwest (Mt. Shasta, Rainier, Hood, Adams, Jefferson, Three Sisters, and others) are due to the Cascadia Subduction Zone. \n\nhttps://www.nps.gov/articles/images/cascadia-topo-earthquakes-and-eruptions-10x.jpg?maxwidth=1300&amp;autorotate=false  \n\n\nThe Juan de Fuca Plate is going underneath the North American Plate, and as it approaches the mantle it heats up and creates a chemical reaction which occurs that sends magma from the mantle toward the surface. Additionally, in portions where the Great Basin abuts the Cascade range (southeast Oregon and northwest California), the rift valleys of the Great Basin further provide easy access for magma to reach the surface. Thus why the landscape is pockmarked by hundreds and hundreds of tiny volcanoes. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuch as this area (make sure to turn it on terrain mode, not satellite or normal map mode): https://www.google.com/maps/place/Black+Butte/@40.5565749,-121.2009649,12.48z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x54cd352881f930d3:0xfa8f198b69cf06ef!8m2!3d40.5432196!4d-121.2283025!16s%2Fg%2F1tc\\_d\\_6c!5m1!1e4",

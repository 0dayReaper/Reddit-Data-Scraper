    "postText": "My dad says that in theory, if you keep increasing the current through any electric motor you will increase the speed of the rotor so speed limits for hybrid and electric cars are dependent on maximum current. I say that electric motors have something like a maximum operating speed that it somewhat dependent on the momentum of the rotor. Saturation of ferromagnetic cores comes to mind as well. Are either of us right/wrong?",

In rough terms, motor current = torque, not top speed (that\u2019s more a function of voltage to counter back EMF).  \n\nAlso, there are absolutely mechanical limits to maximum motor speed.  At some point, the centripetal acceleration on the rotor exceeds the ability of the rotor to keep itself in one piece and you get a high energy grenade.\n\nStator inertia doesn\u2019t really impact maximum speed other than it defines the energy in the grenade when you overspeed and explode a rotor.",

The OP said \"you get a high energy grenade\" not \"grenading.\" He wasn't referencing some specific engineering term. Rather, he was using the term grenade as an informal euphemism, like when SpaceX refers to a crash as a \"rapid unscheduled dissassembly.\"\n2. Let's forget Tesla MS Plaid specifically and just think about motors, echoing the point made by u/Sortalama. Sure, copper expansion isn't grenading - until it is. Once that copper expands while rotating off balance at 20k+ RPM within a tight toleranced stator, it's going to catastrophically fail, and all of that energy has to go somewhere. So, for the purpose of this discussion, copper expansion *is* the same thing as grenading.\n\nNow imagine you wrap super high tension carbon around the copper, exerting a force on the copper resisting expansion. Surely that must help the rotor reach higher RPM intact, right?\n\n3) Now, talking about Tesla again, let's check out the video from Plaid Day:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/live/kUmkbzQ-BS0?t=574](https://www.youtube.com/live/kUmkbzQ-BS0?t=574)\n\nElon: \"The RPM is so crazy that just the centrifugal force wants to expand the rotor, so the **carbon overwrap actually holds the rotor, basically holds the rotor together**. It's like ... madness.\"\n\nIt's the carbon overwrap holding the rotor together. If something is not held together, it falls apart, and if that happens at 20,000 RPM, what happens? Grenade.\n\nI think this has been beaten to death; it's obvious whether you listen to the inventor or you think through the implication of an expanding copper rotor that the carbon wrap, which opposes the rotor expansion, is preventing grenading.",

I think he is looking for more fundamental electrical reasons for a maximum motor speed. AC motors are controlled by driving frequency, I would imagine at sufficiently high frequency, the inductance of the windings will prevent sufficient current from flowing to allow the motor to operate.  In DC motors, and for the same inductance reasons, at high speeds the armature may not have long enough to build up current and magnetic field to repel against the poles. Brushed DC motors would experience severe arcing at high overloads and would fairly quickly burn out.",

It's not hard to generate 10 kHz signals to drive a motor, but quite difficult to make anything mechanical that can handle 600 kRPM. \n\nAerodynamic drag on the rotor is one thing that limits speed, just it does all fast moving objects. A motor at 1 million RPM and 10 cm rotor radius (scale of a car motor) would have a tangential velocity of 1666 m/s, or 6000 km/h. That's a lot of drag to overcome.",

            "comment": "Motor engineer here.\n\nHybrid and electric cars operate mainly on two types of motors which are IM (induction machines) and IPM (internal permanent magnet)\n\nWhat really limits the ability of a certain motor to reach high speed is the back-emf produced by the motor while it's rotating. Back-emf depends on the motor design and the rotating speed. Once the back-emf reaches approximately the supply voltage, you will not be able to push more current through the motor. We can fine-tune the motor (for example by changing the winding of the stator) to suit basically any speed desirable. There are mechanical limits given by the centrifugal force, but for extremely high speed designs they can be overcome by using specialty materials, typically by switching from laminated rotors to solid rotors and changing other stuff in the design to avoid the losses introduced by solid rotors.\n\nThe saturation limit you mentioned is also related to the B field in the motor but goes hand in hand with the number of turns I mentioned, and can be tuned as well for high speed by changing the cross section of the steel parts in the motor itself (teeth, back-iron and so on). There are also exotic materials which can be employed nowadays like iron-cobalt alloys which saturate much higher than conventional silicon-iron steel.\n\nA very high speed motor would have lower torque at low speeds compared to a low speed motor.\n\nIf you take an existing motor design then you are right on the saturation: you could increase the input voltage and that would increase the maximum speed to an extent, but iron saturation would increase the losses dramatically up to a point where the efficiency becomes really low and/or the motor would cook itself. On certain permanent magnet designs you could also demagnetize the magnets so the motor would be damaged.\n\nAlso you can't push arbitrarily as much current as you want, losses in the motor go roughly with current density squared (amps for each square millimeter of copper cross section) so again at some point the motor can bake itself crispy. Once the copper becomes too hot, your wire insulation fails and the windings will short circuit and it's damaged. Magnets also are very temperature sensitive as well.",

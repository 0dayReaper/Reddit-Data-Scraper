The certainly can't imagine \"complex things\", never having been exposed to them where they have an abstract understanding.\n\nBut they certainly are being bombarded with sensory inputs every waking moment.  It's not a stretch to conceive they \"dream\" about inputs like those.  Touch, sound, light.  They can't make sense of them, but they experience them and may well dream about experiencing them.",

A \"reflex\" is a reaction to a sensory input.  I posit they are \"dreaming\" the input and having the expected reflex.  Hypothetically, dream of mom, smile.  Dream of mom being away, cry.\n\nThey can't dream like older children, they can't form stories, scenarios, etc. \n\nBut dreams are our mind hallucinating sensory input and our reactions to them.  \n\nI think it completely plausible that babies smile in their sleep for the exact same reason they do when they are awake.  Their brain is feeding itself imagined sensory input that makes them smile.  An image of their mother, or other input.\n\nIn fact, there is very strong evidence that sleep and dreams are involved in the long term memory process.  Babies ought to be doing exactly the same thing.  Rather than a switch that \"turns on\" at 2 years of age, almost certainly their dreams start as simple sensory inputs that slowly grow in sophistication as the child themselves grow in sophistication.",

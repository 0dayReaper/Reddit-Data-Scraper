            "comment": "Yes and no. The immune system will actually try to destroy cancer if it can, so one of the first ways a tumor can actually grow and not be eliminated is by co-opting parts of the immune system to work for it. There are certain macrophages called Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) that actually aid in tumor growth and metastasis by removing debris, promoting angiogenesis, and encouraging the growth and repair of tissues. Tumors also tend to be associated with a fairly large number of Regulatory T-cells (T-regs) that are responsible for suppressing any immune response that might otherwise be trying to destroy the tumor. These are part of the tumor microenvironment that's essential for the tumor to grow and propagate, but they don't exactly qualify as an immune system for the tumor itself.\n\nAs for how tumors survive infections, that depends too. Macrophages are pretty good at eating bacteria, so having a lot of TAMs hanging around will probably keep low-level infection at bay. At the same time, one type of immunotherapy used to treat cancer is to use certain types of oncolytic viruses and bacteria to either directly kill cancer cells, get the immune system's attention so it will go in and kill the cancer cells, or both. If an infection of some kind gets into the tumor, there's a chance the immune cells in the tumor microenvironment will clear it out and there's also a chance that it will cause a cascade that leads to the tumor's destruction. It really comes down to the type and location of the cancer. The word \"cancer\" is just a catch-all for any one of hundreds of very different malignantly mutated cell diseases which may have very little in common with each other, so any questions about how they work or respond to various factors will have multiple answers.",

There are of course other immune interactions which are as-of-yet undiscovered or not well understood, cancer immunology is maybe the most active field of current cancer research (I work on it myself).",

The immune system actively seeks out cancer cells and almost always successfully kills them. \n\nThey survive external infections as the immune system fights to protect the body as a whole including the cancerous tumour.",

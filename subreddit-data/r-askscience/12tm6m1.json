    "postText": "I only have a highschool understanding of science, so forgive me if I'm using words incorrectly.\n\nBut is the blueish-white lights we see a result of air that has been temporarily turned into a plasma? Electricity, the motion of electrons, is not visible to the naked eye (if at all?). If this is not the case, why are electrical arcs visible?",

The term you want to look up is [electric discharge.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_discharge_in_gases) Pretty broad topic that touches on everything from vacuum tubes to lightning. But the TLDR is yes everything you can see, arcs, sparks etc is a plasma phenomenon. The light comes from recombination and bremstrahlung of the electrons in the plasma.",

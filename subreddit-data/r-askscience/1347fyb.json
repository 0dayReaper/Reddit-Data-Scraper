    "postText": "So I was thinking of this scenario.\n\nSay you take a pipe, fill it with water, cap the ends (kinda like a pipe-bomb) and throw it into the fire. Thermal energy will transfer from the heat of the fire to the pipe, to the water, causing it to boil and eventually explode when water turned to steam.\n\nNow take the same pipe, fill with water and submerge it in liquid nitrogen.  Water will freeze, expanding it and do nearly exact same thing; exploding it..\n\nQuestion is, if the fire is providing thermal energy to the water to explode it, but energy is leaving the water as it freezes, where is the energy coming from that bursts the pipe?",

But the freezing temperature dropped somewhat because a larger driving force was required. And if enough energy is required for expansion (that is, if that water is sufficiently compressed), then the heat released by ice formation is insufficient to pay for the mechanical work, and complete freezing into pure ice-Ih won't occur at all\u2014we'll need a combination of ice-Ih and ice-III, at which point we'll need to lower the temperature to around -22\u00b0C for complete freezing. This corresponds to an extremely high pressure of about 2000 atmospheres!",

            "comment": "Mechanical work can, in theory, be extracted whenever you have some kind of energy gradient. In the case of heating a water filled pipe, there is a gradient between the \"hot\" side (the fire) and the \"cold\" side (the water and steam). The flow of energy from hot to cold causes the water to change phase into steam, which takes up more space and eventually causes enough pressure to burst the pipe. \nIn the second scenario, the \"hot\" and \"cold\" sides are reversed. The water in the pipe is warmer than the freezer, so energy flows out. This also causes a phase change, and since ice is less dense than water, it expands, builds up pressure, and can burst the container. Since crystallization is an exothermic process, the water releases thermal energy as it freezes, which is why it won't drop below its freezing point until fully frozen. This \"heat of crystallization\" is the energy that pressurizes and potentially bursts the container.",

In short, the thermal energy in the liquid water being released is the source of mechanical energy that breaks pipe.\n\nWill the water stay \u2018liquid\u2019 far below its normal freezing temperature, until the pipe bursts and then become ice instantly?",

I think u/chemomechanics explained it a bit better but used some way too sciency words that I\u2019m still googling. Nitrogen is gaining thermal energy and water is losing thermal energy, but some energy is becoming mechanical building pressure. \n\nIf I\u2019m understanding the responses, the opposite way higher temps are needed to boil water at higher pressures,,  lower temperatures are needed to freeze water at higher pressures, because some thermal energy from the water is transferred to mechanical energy for the formation of ice crystals.",

In both cases, the water changes phase, and the new phase is less dense than water, so it exerts pressure on the container. Either way, the energy to create that pressure comes from the \"hot\" side of the gradient.\n\nAs for your other question, you can lower the freezing point of water by applying pressure... just not very much. If you look at the phase diagram for water (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338142645/figure/fig2/AS:870171413602304@1584476440134/Schematic-water-phase-diagram-Below-the-critical-point-that-is-374-K-and-218-atm-the.png) you can see that at pressures above 1 atmosphere, the freezing point of water (represented by the boundary between the \"ice\" and \"water\" sections) does drop below 0 Centigrade. However, this relationship is not linear, so even extremely high pressure will only drop the freezing point by a few degrees.",

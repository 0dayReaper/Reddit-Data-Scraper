            "comment": "There is a role for screening for specific conditions in at risk groups like lung cancer in smokers. (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1911793)\n\nHowever the incidence of finding 'incidentalomas' on whole body CT scanning can be quite high. Given that we are talking about screening here rather than doing a scan based on symptoms the pre test probability of these abnormal scan findings being a serious cancer is low. But as you have found something you still need to follow it up. This exposes people to psychological distress and potentially puts them at risk of needing invasive procedures to try to get a sample tissue for diagnosis. These procedures often have their own risks.\n\nThe CT scan also involves exposure to ionising radiation, which on population levels would actually increase the risk of subsequent cancers.\n\nThere is also the risk of 'lead time bias' where you pick up a disease early through screening but if your available treatments are not great you may not alter the course of that disease and the patient ends up dying at the same time as they would have done anyway. But the fact that you made the diagnosis earlier makes it look like your screening is working to extend life expectancy.\n\nAlso it's expensive to screen people. These things and others are why screening programs need to be looked at carefully by statisticians who will consider how good the test is vs the prevalence of the disease in the population you are looking at before considering whether it is worthwhile.",

Say your risk of cancer is doubled from a CT (it's not a real number, just example) but your risk before was 0,00000001. Your risk doubling still means your risk is very very small. However, this might actually mean something if your looking at a billion people. Numbers are exagerated here, but I hope I made the point clear?",

If CT scanning everybody finds 2 in 1 mill cancers and causes 1, than yes,  I suppose you're right or rather it evens out. But nothing is ever that simple 'cause you have to consider how many other things happen. If it leads to 50 in 1 mill that have unnessesary liver biopsis and 1 in 50 of those die and 2 in those 50 have complications that lead to prolonged hospital stays then we're beginning to see a problem for society. A lot of people on this thread have made very good points already. I suppose originally I just wanted to reassure that there being a population risk of cancers from CT scans doesnt nessesarely mean that the induvidual has increased their risk vastly by having one or 2.",

            "comment": "Besides the increased radiation and other risks, CT Scans are both expensive and not a \u201ccatch all\u201d. They are much more useful for confirming a suspected diagnosis that\u2019s already been narrowed down by symptoms and other much more mundane screening.\n\nThe larger issue is preventative care, which is not really addressed well in places like the US. Step one is getting more people to actually bother with an annual physical exam, which can catch many of the conditions that currently are discovered \u201ctoo late\u201d. Something like only 20% of Americans get one, for various reasons - insurance doesn\u2019t always cover fully, poor outreach, inconvenience trying to schedule one and fragmented primary care (not everyone has a primary care physician or insurance, and non-urgent appointments often must be scheduled months in advance).\n\nSolving that problem first would be much more effective. No reason to turn to expensive technology immediately, and if you can\u2019t even get people to do a routine doctors visit. Imagine trying to schedule *everyone* for CT Scans!\n\nWhich brings the other issue of \u201ctiming\u201d. Often there aren\u2019t detectable signs of things like cancer until they actually start, which narrows the window to and handful of years, so you\u2019d have to scan everyone every year, not just once",

Other answers cover this aspect well.\n\nFinally, to do what you propose, you would be spending a lot more of GDP--that is, national income--on health care, which I think is already above 20% of GDP in the US.  This would cause labor shortages for all other industries that do useful things (produce electricity, cars, phones, etc).",

            "comment": "I learned about this years ago but all I can remember is that a rise in temperature occurs in response to the detection of viral/ bacterial infection and this is facilitated by the hypothalamus. It becomes part of what\u2019s called a positive feedback loop and for this \u201cloop\u201d to disengage some sort of negative feedback must occur.",

                    "comment": "The viral/bacterial detection comes from toll-like receptors (TLRs) and pattern recognition receptors that are activated by bacterial cell debris or viral DNA. This activation prompts a sequence of events that leads to the generation of cytokines interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 (IL-1, IL-6). These cytokines cause a fever by increasing the synthesis of prostaglandins in the hypothalamus. These prostaglandins, namely Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), act centrally to release neurotransmitters like noradrenaline, which increases body temperature. Noradrenaline accomplishes this by constricting blood vessels to conserve heat loss and promoting breakdown of energy stores in adipose tissue. The latter process generates energy and is exothermic, hence it generates heat. \n\nI would also think that the delicate control of body temperature is regulated by negative feedback loops. Noradrenaline release, for example, is closely controlled by presynaptic adrenergic alpha2A receptors that, when activated, slow further release of noradrenaline. Prostaglandins also inhibit the production of cytokines to create a negative feedback loop where PGE2 indirectly inhibits their own synthesis.",

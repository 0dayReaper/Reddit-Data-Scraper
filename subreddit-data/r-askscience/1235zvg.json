            "comment": "Yes and no. COVID-19 was rare among viruses in that the ACE2 receptor sites exist on nearly all the cells in your body. This differs from flu viruses that typically only infect nasal, lung, or throat tissue by binding to the sialic acid receptors which are prevalent in these types of tissue but rare otherwise. This was the reason that COVID-19 will cause a wide range of symptoms that vary dramatically from person to person while flu symptoms tend to be the same with varying levels of severity.\n\nBecause covid attacks so many different kinds of a cells, you can have temporary or permanent damage to a wide variety of organs and essential cells that will cause long term or permanent symptoms. These can vary dramatically from person to person. While one person experiences permanent lung damage another might experience neurological symptoms.\n\nMeanwhile the flu can and does cause damage to lung tissue. This scarring is known as pulmonary fibrosis, and it is permanent. The good news is that a healthy person typically has lots of extra lung capacity. So, a normal flu infection (once recovered) may reduce your lung capacity permanently, but it won't be missed. However a severe flu infection can have lingering symptoms for a long time, and you may incur enough damage to even need oxygen therapy.",

How much you lose depends on the severity of the illness. \n\nAlso, as others have pointed out, you may experience acute periods of low oxygen that can damage other organs as well as collateral damage from neutrophils during an active infection. Also secondary bacterial infections are somewhat common with the flu, and these can do substantial additional damage.",

If covid-19 came out in the 1700s, it would have fizzled out hitting only a small number of communities due to the short period of time people are contagious.

The CDC reports that \u201ctravel and commerce between affected cities were sometimes restricted \\[by local officials\\]. Public health officials imposed quarantines (used to separate and restrict the movement of well people who may have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become ill) on homes and towns where polio cases were diagnosed.\u201d&gt; President Harry Truman spoke frequently about the need for a national mobilization against polio. But what he meant by this was to rally people to be cautious, follow medical guidelines, isolate the infected, and get the medical community inspired to find means of treatment and cure.\n\n&gt; In May 1949, after an outbreak in San Angelo, Texas (my father remembers this), the city council voted (voted!) to close all indoor meeting places for one week,\n\n&gt; Most indoor theaters and bowling alleys stayed closed\n\n&gt; Some towns and cities across the United States tried to prevent the spread of polio by closing swimming pools, libraries, and movie theaters\n\nFrom your quoted article. Which is a load of biased hogwash bitching about national lockdowns, focusing on how quarantines were handled locally and not nationally and caused by fear.\n\nFact remains: people openly and widely quarantined during outbreaks. Places shut down and events were cancelled. Distance learning was a thing, done over radio in the 1940s. The only difference between then and now was that then people did it voluntarily and willingly and now we have a bunch of snowflakes crying about muh freedums and refusing to quarantine or mask out of principal. Perhaps if we didn't have them running around, we wouldn't have had to have large scale mandatory shutdowns.\n\n&gt; [Even before that feverish fortnight, the city health commissioner, Haven Emerson\u2014the great-nephew of the celebrated poet Ralph Waldo Emerson\u2014made it his business to keep New Yorkers apart. Children under 16 were not permitted in crowded public places, including movie theaters. Open air movies, a favorite summer attraction, were forbidden. Fourth of July celebrations were canceled.](https://time.com/5831740/polio-coronavirus-parallels/) This is New York City in 1916. You could also be taken by force by health officials to hospitals.\n\n&gt; [Numerous municipalities, including the City of Milwaukee, initiated a polio quarantine for children younger than 12 during August and September 1944. Nearby suburbs followed suit. The Greendale Board of Health, for example, established a similar quarantine on Aug. 30, 1944.(...) In Greendale, police officer Arthur Krueger was charged to patrol the town, making sure no young person dared leave their home.(...)By 1948, such limited quarantines had become standard practice to deal with polio outbreaks across the United States. In September of that year the city of Milwaukee called for a temporary quarantine not only for children under 12, but also for pregnant women](https://shepherdexpress.com/culture/milwaukee-history/when-the-polio-epidemic-forced-milwaukeeans-to-stay-at-home/) Milwaukie and suburbs, the 1940s.

The 1920's flu literature and understanding of psychological effects of disease was limited, therefore documentation of some other long term effects most likely did not happen.

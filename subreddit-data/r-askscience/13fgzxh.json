            "comment": "Is \"crapload\" a new official SI unit? Jokes aside, many volcanoes do produce *huge* volumes of erupted rock, but one of the critical things to realize is that volcanoes erupt at a variety of scales. This is somewhat easily visualized with the [Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_explosivity_index), which in part is based on the volume of erupted products. If you look at the scale, you can see the huge range of erupted volumes that are produced where a VEI 0 is going to erupt less than 10^(4) m^(3) (which is equivalent to the volume of ~4 Olympic sized swimming pools, since we've already introduced some 'alternative' units). By the time we're at the top of the scale for a VEI 8, this is considering volume of erupted products greater than 1000 km^(3). For a sense of scale for that one, for an eruption exactly 1000 km^(3) that would be a volume of erupted products between the volumes of Lake Erie (480 km^(3)) and Lake Ontario (1,640 km^(3)). \n\nThe additional consideration is that within those volumes, there are a variety of different products that will be deposited differently both in terms of thickness but also extent, which can in part distort the total volumes of material erupted. Some of the main categories will be lava (leaving behind volcanic rock, e.g., basalt), [pyroclastic flows and density currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow) leaving behind deposits we'd generically refer to as [ingimbrites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignimbrite), and various \"fall\" deposits made up of [volcanic ash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash) that produce a variety of deposits that might be described as [tephras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tephra) or [tuffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuff) depending on the details (and sometimes parts of deposits associated with pyroclastic flows are also described as tuffs). Deposits from lava will typically be confined to relatively close to the vent, but this will depend on the type of lava as well (e.g., more silica rich lava that is generally associated with more explosive eruptions is pretty viscous and won't travel too far, whereas less silica rich lava, like that erupted at places like Hawaii, can flow relatively far, but the total volume is important as well in terms of distribution). Pyroclastic density currents and the ignimbrites they leave behind will also be confined to *relatively* close to the vent, but these can run out significant distances from the vent depending on the details (e.g., anywhere from less than a km to &gt;100 km depending on volume, e.g., [this review paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825221001987)). Tephras and tuffs, since they tend to represent mostly deposition of material lofted into the air, can extend *very far* but their thicknesses will be extremely variable. They can be very thick close to the vent, but can also spread across huge distances, e.g., [this map of the distribution of ash beds from some major eruptions in the US](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/map-known-ash-fall-boundaries-several-us-eruptions). At the periphery of many of these, the beds may only be a mm or two thick, but it still represents a huge volume of material in aggregate.",

                    "comment": "To add to this, the simple fact is that what goes up must come down. Big explosive eruptions which disperse fine ash can cause thin laminations that cover huge areas spanning the globe, similarly you can have small eruptions which put down big thicknesses but in limited areas. For example, the [Fuego eruption in 2018 erupted a few tens of millions of cubic meters of material](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377027323000483), but that wos concentrated into pyroclastic flows. Some of the surrounding valleys received deposits in excess of 40 m thick, but if you travel just a few kilometers away in another direction there's almost no sign of the eruption at all. The volume of deposits from some eruptions is mindboggling. The Bishop Tuff deposit (600 km^3 eruption) is over 1500 m thick in places.",

            "comment": "Because of:\n\nEruption Dynamics: The nature of volcanic eruptions can vary greatly depending on the type of volcano and the specific eruption style. Some eruptions can be explosive, resulting in the ejection of a large volume of ash, volcanic gases, and fragmented rock, known as pyroclastic material. These materials can be deposited over a wide area, sometimes far from the volcano itself. However, not all eruptions are highly explosive, and the extent and distribution of erupted materials can differ significantly.\n\nAtmospheric Transport: Ash and fine-grained volcanic particles can be carried by wind currents over long distances. During volcanic eruptions, the ejected materials can be dispersed high into the atmosphere, where they may remain airborne for extended periods. Eventually, these particles settle out of the atmosphere and can be deposited in various locations far from the eruption site. This process can lead to widespread distribution rather than a concentrated accumulation near the volcano.\n\nErosion and Weathering: Over time, the rocks and deposits left by volcanic eruptions are subject to weathering and erosion processes. Rain, wind, and other natural forces gradually break down and redistribute volcanic materials. Rivers, streams, and other water bodies can carry away sediment, while wind can transport lighter particles over long distances. These ongoing geological processes can contribute to the dispersal and fragmentation of volcanic deposits.\n\nSubsidence and Caldera Formation: In some cases, massive volcanic eruptions can lead to the collapse of the volcano's summit or the formation of a caldera\u2014a large, basin-shaped depression. These events can result in the removal or collapse of vast amounts of material into the subsurface or can be dispersed over a wide area, making the immediate surroundings appear less impacted.",

            "comment": "If you're thinking of all the volume of rock that is being thrown in the air, explosive volcanic eruptions are REALLY powerful and can either blow rock apart into tiny fragments of ash, or during the eruption larger chunks of rock get smashed into each other and break down into smaller fragments (and ash).\n\nSo they absolutely do, it can be thousands of cubic kilometres of rock. But often the more massive material falls quickly to earth and the ash settles on top of it, disguising it.",

            "comment": "They do. You just have to consider the amount of boom involved to know where to look.\n\nSimplified explanation:\n\n0. No boom today, boom tomorrow. The volcano did not erupt, but notice how it looks bigger than before?\n\n1. Slow leakage. The molten rock is flowing down and around the volcano. Potentially multiple craptons of rock, but it just raises the ground a little. Meanwhile the volcano deflates as it empties so the result may look less rocky than before.\nAlso this can happen over days/weeks.\n\n2. Sudden diarrhea fart. Rock everywhere, but much of it is either liquid or gaseous/ash. Good luck calculating exactly how much that is without expert education.\n\n3. Boom. The crapton of rock is now spread over multiple zip codes, so any given location might not look like there is much rock. Imagine shooting in the air and how unlikely it is that you see the bullet come down, but it definitely does.\n\n4. Big bada boom. The volcano disappears and rains down in multiple counties. Or countries. Or continents. Some of it explodes into so fine particles they stay in the air for months.",

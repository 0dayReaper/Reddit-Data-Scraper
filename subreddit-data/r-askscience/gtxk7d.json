You could also theoretically express a sentence by using the right characters with the wrong radical and people would probably be able to understand more or less but it wouldn't be fluid like we read your title's sentence in English.",

Especially because speakers different dialects of Chinese will find one piece of text mutually intelligible, but if they were to read it aloud to each other, they would sound completely different and likely not understand each other.",

I've heard before that Mandarin and Cantonese are written in a very similar way, yet pronounced totally differently. So hypothetically, if a Mandarin and Cantonese person are trying to converse, they won't be able to understand each other, yet they could write down what they're saying to each other and be able to understand each other's writing.\n\nHow does that work, exactly? As an English speaker that's hard to wrap my head around. Every dialect of English is grammatically identical for the most part, they only differ in pronunciation. Even dialects like Jamaican English, or Scots English, which can sound quite different at first, are actually just regular English with a lot of slang and can be easily understood by any English speaker who is used to the accent and knows the slang.",

The meaning is the same across dialects/languages, but the pronunciation and potentially grammar system surrounding the meaning is different.",

Basically, since each character typically conveys a concept (\u9c7c, for example, means \"fish\"), you can get the gist of what somebody is writing about even if the grammar is slightly off or you don't understand a few of the characters (places that adopted Hanzi sometimes added their own characters to the list or use them in slightly different ways). For example, \u6211\u5403\u9c7c means \"I eat fish\". Even though it would be \"I fish eat\" with Japanese grammar, you'd still more or less understand what the person was trying to say if you understood the individual characters in the sentence.\n\nAs a side note, a reason for the huge differences between \"dialects\" is that, linguistically speaking, a lot of them are closer to being separate languages than just dialects (and many of them have dialects of their own). Comparisons have been drawn between the major dialect groups (Mandarin, Wu, Yue, Hakka, Min, etc.) and the Romance languages (French, Spanish, Italian, etc.) in that due to time, geographic distance, political disunity, and other factors they eventually drifted apart from one original language (Latin/Old Chinese). However, the same Chinese writing system more or less stayed in place the entire time (it did evolve over time and vernacular writing does exist, but ancient scripts are often still readable in the modern day). It's also worth noting that even within the major families there are still mutually unintelligible dialects and multiple dialects can exist even within one city, although these might be more comparable to something like Scots vs American English.\n\n****\n\nEdit: As pointed out by /u/chiuyan, \u6211\u5403\u9c7c wouldn't actually work that well for this as it uses more modern meanings for the characters. I meant to just demonstrate the basic idea of it rather than an actual functional example, sorry for any confusion!",

However, the pronunciation can change based on which Chinese language you're speaking. Unlike alphabet-based languages where the letters sound out sounds, Chinese characters mostly have no indication on what the characters sounds like, so therefore it is possible to read the same Chinese text in multiple different Chinese languages.\n\nOf course, there might be minor grammatical differences and idioms in the different Chinese languages, but that's just a minor issue and with context, can be understood. (for example a text written with Cantonese speakers in mind still makes sense to a Mandarin speaker, but there still might be minor differences).\n\nThe Chinese government, however, wants everyone to speak the national language (Mandarin) which is why it prefers to not call these Chinese languages, languages. There are also other languages that are pretty much exactly the same but have different names, because of politics. For example Croatian and Serbian, or Moldovan and Romanian.

The two modern written Chinese languages are traditional and simplified Chinese. The mutual intelligiblity between Mandarin and Cantonese is pretty low and uneven. (Just like most native English speakers understand general American accent but most Americans will find general British accent challenging.) \n\nMost Cantonese speakers understand a little bit of Mandarin since some elementary and high \ud83c\udfeb may offer to teach Mandarin but not the other way.\n\n  \n\n\nThe best comparable examples I can think of, albeit imperfect, will be the Scandinavian languages. There is an uneven mutual intelligiblity among the speakers. Swedish probably is most  understood among the Scandinavian speakers because of Sweden economic/cultural dominance. Most Scandinavians will understand each other's written language to some degree because of shared similarities.\n\n  \n\n\nI think most Chinese will have problems understand jumbled up Chinese. There are too many homonyms. For example, the popular tongue twister, \"\u897f\u65bd\u6b7b\u6642\u56db\u5341\u56db\",  all the words have the sound, \"shi\", and you can see they are all different words, except the third word from the last and the very last one. \n\n  \n\n\nJust my opinion. I have lived in Hong Kong for 16 years. My Chinese isn't perfect but I am fluent enough to carry a conversation, read and write simple documents, and sing horrible karaoke. There is no written Mandarin or Cantonese. It is a misconception. There is, however, Chinese written with Mandarin or Cantonese syntaxes. It is kind of like English written sounded like Southern accent, such as \"brother/brotha\" or Boston accent, such as \"water/wadda\", but Southern and Boston accents aren't written English.",

Although obviously a closely related language, standard written Chinese can be quite different from spoken Cantonese, different vocab and different grammar. If a Cantonese speaker writes something down in exactly the way they speak, a Mandarin speaker would find it extremely difficult to understand and would find certain parts completely unintelligible. \n  \nThis used to be true for all Chinese speakers back when all written Chinese used classical Chinese, as classical Chinese is very different from all modern spoken dialects. But now standard written Chinese is very similar to modern spoken Mandarin, although not exactly the same.",

Over time the spoken version has split as people remained geographically isolated. We can trace back where each dialect split based on their current similarities. There are some dialects that they think are pretty direct links to Old Chinese (Min, for instance), whereas Mandarin and Cantonese shifted first to Middle Chinese and then early modern Chinese. Tracing the cognates and origins is fascinating stuff! &lt;-- Chinese philology nerd",

When I mentioned this, he told me that \u5929 was originally the symbol for his family name, before Vietnam started using Latin letters.

When I lived in China there was a protest against Deng Xiaoping (\u9127\u5c0f\u5e73) when he died.  It wasn\u2019t labeled as such, protests being wildly illegal, but people gathered to break small bottles (\u5c0f\u74f6 - xiaoping) and everyone knew exactly what they meant, but breaking bottles wasn\u2019t illegal.\n\nSimilarly there have been protests against Mao Zedong (\u6bdb\u6fa4\u6771) where people killed cats (\u732b - mao), which was similarly clear.\n\n(I know, traditional characters, not simplified.  I learned the traditional first and prefer them to the simplified).\n\nIn speaking it\u2019s possible to miss part of a sentence and have a very clear, but wrong understanding of something totally different because you missed the context and heard all the correct sounds and tones, but understood them as different words.\n\nIn crosstalk, a type of Chinese verbal comedy there is a specialized sub-type where two people are having a conversation that\u2019s carefully constructed so that every thing they say can be correctly interpreted as one of two very different conversations.  They\u2019ll talk to each other, each one about a different subject, with the responses of the other person making sense for their conversation, and the other person is doing exactly the same thing with their conversation.  Apparently that specific type of crosstalk is really difficult and few people can do to well.",

A few words took some reasoning, and the common factor with all of them is that the small \u3083/\u3085/\u3087 was no longer attached to the right character, and I think it would be even more comprehensible if you treated the whole sound as one \"letter\" when scrambling.\n\nI think there's also a slight equivalent in kanji, where you can use the wrong character for something and if you still leave the \"shape\" and primary radicals of the word intact it will remain readable. Like if you were to write... \u6182\u9b31 as \u512a\u9b31 I probably wouldn't notice if I was just skimming the text because the main radical is the same and the \u9b31 kanji is so visually distinctive.",

Since in English the letters are scrambled, the most direct equivalent would be swapping the positions of strokes around within a character.  I would say in general this produces completely gibberish characters that are near impossible to decipher. For English you basically just need to mentally shift alphabets left and right to decipher a jumbled up word, but in Chinese the strokes can move \"360 degrees\" within a character so the permutations are endless. Take a common character like \u6211 (wo), which means \"me\" or \"I\". Maybe some slight shifting of the strokes is ok, but swapping the strokes around creates mutant characters that literally don't exist in the Chinese dictionary and would be unpronounceable and have no meaning.",

If you throw random strokes all over the place, you are likely no longer using valid radicals.  \n  \nInstead of messing up stroke position, consider simply messing up a radical. For example: \u60c5, \u8bf7, and \u6e05 are all phonetically similar; a native speaker could recognize the intended meaning and also the mistake.  \n  \nChinese can also misunderstand the intended character for a word they frequently hear. For example, on a shopping list, my mother in law wrote \"\u8c46\u4ed8\", which is a misunderstanding of the second character \"\u8c46\u8150\u201c (tofu). And no, it wasn't an intentional abbreviation. It was more like when an English speaker says \"mute point\" instead of \"moot point.\"",

Actually OP was not precise enough in the exact definitions of the word.\n\n\u672a signifies that something has not happened so when you pair it with \u4f86(come,arrived) it will become \u672a\u4f86(has not happened to come/arrived, i.e. future) while.\n\nWhile \u672b signifies the last. So if you pair it with \u65e5(day) to make \u672b\u65e5 it will be the last day.\n\nThe above example contains commonly seen phrases so many people will not confuse between them but when they are written(wrongly) not in a commonly seen phrase or singularly, the misunderstanding can be humourous or disaster based on your perspective. If written wrongly in a phrase that the reader knows, it's rather easy to know what the writer is conveying while acknowledging that the word was written wrongly.",

We need testing to know.\n\nI suggest reframing the question as \"how much can you scramble the strokes within characters and have it remain readable?\".   The fact that hand written Chinese is legible proves that legibility is robust against some minor variations.  To know how much more can be changed and have it remain legible we need experimental results.",

You can look at a chinese character, e.g. \u6211, like a piece of canvas. You could shift the strokes around a small bit or literally all over the canvas and it could have wildly different interpretations.",

Another popular one is \"\ub2a5\uc9c0\" instead of \"\uc9c0\ub2a5\"(intelligence), for when they do something dumb.\n\nAlso people will sometimes /r/keming a word by choosing syllable blocks that look similar to entirely different ones, for instance \"\ucee4\uc2e0\" instead of \"\uadc0\uc2e0\"(ghost). This is often called \"\uc57c\ubbfc\uc815\uc74c\" due to its origins from a certain online community.\n\nThere was also a fad in the 90s to early 2000's where people would replace the typical blocks with other characters, or space them out. This sort of thing is sometimes called \"\uadc0\uc5ec\ub2c8\uccb4\" from an internet writer who did this extensively.\n\nThese examples are all intentional, but the same result remains - people are surprisingly good at pattern recognition in general and would have no trouble understanding a sentence with a small amount of scrambling.

            "comment": "One way to tackle this that hasn't been mentioned yet is via information theory.\n\nYou can read the text because English has some redundancy in its information content.  If I give you the letters \"sentenc_\", you can guess that the missing letter is \"e\" -- the e is pretty much redundant.  If I gave you \"thi_\", it might be \"this\" or \"thin\", but probably not \"thib\".  If \"albe\" and \"tihs\" and \"setencne\" were all valid English words, deciphering your topic sentence would be a lot harder!\n\nWe can distinguish between the \"symbol data rate\" and \"information rate\" of a written language.  The symbol data rate is the number of data bits needed to describe a random sequence of scrambled characters, taking into account the frequency of the characters.  Since English has 26 letters, you'd think that you'd need 5 bits (2^5 = 32) to represent them all, but since \"e\" and \"t\" are so common, the symbol rate of English is actually about 1.5 bits per symbol.\n\nThe *information rate* (entropy) can be obtained by asking native speakers to predict the next letter, or else by using a data compression algorithm to re-encode the text without the redundancy.  The information rate of English is less than the frequency of random letters, about 1 bit per symbol -- so English has a redundancy rate of about 50%.\n\nRemember, it's this redundancy that makes it possible to read incomplete or error-filled text.  What is the redundancy in other languages?\n\n[This paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a44d/9b998c1451328bcb4517ed9c1930171e0a79.pdf) calculates information rates for a variety of languages.  Since Chinese has a much larger number of symbols, each symbol has more information content -- but of course, some still occur more frequently than others.  For Chinese, the symbol data rate is about 4.8 bits per symbol.  The *information* data rate is about 3 bits per symbol.  Thus, the redundancy of written Chinese is also about 40%.\n\nJapanese as you'd imagine is somewhere in between.  Symbol rate of about 4 bits per symbol, info rate of about 2.6 -- about 40% redundancy.\n\nThere is one interesting exception: Korean.  It's symbol rate is about 3.6 bps, information rate 3.3 -- about 10% redundancy.  This may be because the Korean writing system was specifically designed to represent Korean, rather than evolving naturally over thousands of years.  (Romanized versions of Japanese and Chinese also have low redundancy.)\n\nThe upshot: the writing systems for most natural languages have similar amounts of information redundancy, which allow you to read them even if they're garbled.\n\nhttps://www.britannica.com/science/information-theory/Linguistics\nhttps://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a44d/9b998c1451328bcb4517ed9c1930171e0a79.pdf",

About a decade ago, a noticeable number of the younger generation in China started using the Martian Language when posting on the internet. They used this \u201clanguage\u201d to distinguish themselves from the older generation and who were not fashionable enough. Later on, it became a symbolic behavior of the Smart subculture. What the Martian language do is basically replacing each correct Chinese character with another one that looks similar but with more strokes or less. Sometimes a few random meaningless decorative characters were added too. For example,\n\nSimplified Chinese: \u6211\u5f88\u6000\u5ff5\u8fc7\u53bb,\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u90a3\u53ea\u662f\u8fc7\u53bb\n\nMartian Language: \u3006\u3001\u83aa\u4f77\u61f7\u6df0\u904e\u53be\uff0c\u6cf9\u54ef\u5be6\u54e0\u8a34\u83aa\u54ea\u546e\u6e5c\u904e\u53be\u30be\n\nEnglish: I yearn the past a lot, but the reality tells me that it\u2019s only in the past.\n\nYou may noticed that each corresponding character has some common part with the original character. How normal Chinese character is converted doesn\u2019t have a unified rule. It largely depends on the tool being used. But normally people are able to read those sentences without too much trouble. In Chinese language, it doesn\u2019t make much sense to randomly scramble the strokes in a character especially when typing with a computer, but the Martian language shows that it\u2019s still possible to read Chinese when the characters are changed.\n\nInterestingly, the Smart subculture later was considered not so smart by the majority of the internet users. Then less and less people use Martian Language.",

Is kataba the infinitive form though which people would conjugate a verb from a common base\n\nYes there is a pattern for conjugation, and always there are exceptions to the rules. But verb conjugation goes a step further. The Afro-Asiatic languages use a root system. The root is a concept that words are built on it. \n\nSo the root here is k-t-b and with that you have yaktubu - he writes, aktubu - I write, taktubu - you write. Past tense example: katabna - we wrote. Also you get nouns like kitaab - a book (something that is written). Places like maktab which can mean office (a place for writing)\n\nThe root system is so neat that when you encounter a new word, many times you can infer the meaning with contextual clues and the shared root.",

Actually in old time Calligraph (writing with brush pen), drawing part of stroke in a different way is recognized as an art form of writing. Showing the high intelligence of the writer.\n\nHowever, in the other way, a lot of Chinese and Japanese words have similar sound but different graphic (like 'see' and 'sea') and sometimes people just got mixed but we could still read and understood the meaning the writer wants to say, however its recognized as evidence of low writing ability....",

For example if you took the common thank you, in Korean, \"cam-sa-ham-ni-da\" \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4 they would write it like this for the game \u3131 \u3145 \u314e \u3134 \u3137, which removes everything but the initial letter/sound and the players would have to guess what word or phrase they're trying to say, first one to answer, wins the round.   Not the same as jumbling up letters in English, but along similar lines, to me, at least.",

In my native language, Malayalam, to add the \"o\" sound to a letter (each letter represents a syllable defaulting have the \"a\" at the end, for example \"\u0d38\" is \"sa\") you need to put a specific type of \"e\" behind the letter you want to change, and put a specific type of \"a\" in front. So if you jumbled the letters, it would be illegible.",

            "comment": "In Vietnamese, the language is tonal like Chinese but because of colonization, we use Latin characters with symbols on vowels to express tones. A lot of the time when you send a text message (so this is a modern concept) we send text without the symbols. Meaning there are many many possibilities of each word, string of words and sentences. But you use context clues to understand what the person sent you. \n\nFor example, without symbols. Ba , con doi bung qua\n\nExamples of words With symbols for tone:\nBa=dad or three; b\u00e0=Old woman\n\u0111\u00f3i=  hungry ; \u0111\u00f4i= pair; \u0111\u1ed5i=swap/switch\n\nWith context it Translates to : Dad, I\u2019m really hungry!\n\n\n\nThis question is through the lens of a western/English language so the answers ITT are quite interesting.",

            "comment": "As a fluent Chinese reader and amateur Japanese reader, I can safely say that this phenomenon exists but in a different way.\n\nSingle alphabets most likely do not possess meaning, unless they form a pattern which is known as a word. Chinese and Japanese like wise has strokes like \u4e00 \u4e28 \u4e3f \u4e36 which makes no sense individualy, but form meaning when gathered like \u672f (arts, skills) and \u6728 (wood). Notice the similarity of the characters? Bogus handwriting of displacing the dot on \u672f from the right side to the left most likely does not affect fluidity of reading in context, and more complex characters like \u8e81 and \u566a may be sometimes misused even by Chinese users. Still, it would make sense in context.\n\nChinese is also still readable as a scrambled sentence like when you displace the verbs and nouns here and there, which is not surprising given the way people creatively come up with slangs to simplify their lives. The brain simply recognizes the important phrases and ignore the grammar integrity.\n\nFurthermore, when multiple characters form a phrase recognizable enough, the phrase can be cross recognized when placed across lines or even scrambled everywhere. The unique 'block' characters allow phrases to form crossword girds and make things mind boggling while still barely making sense at the same time.",

            "comment": "The analog to letters in Chinese characters are radicals. Each character consists of multiple (usually 2 or 3 radicals), with some characters having special strokes.\n\nUsually the first radical indicates a sort of categorization of the word, and the second radical is a phonetic.\n\nNote: this is true only of simplified chinese, since traditional chinese is descended from a time when the pronounciations of words was different and characters were separate from the pronounciation.\n\nNow radicals can be arranged in several ways - it can be left/right (most common), it can be top/bottom, it can be outside/inside. If it was three radicals, the common arrangements are left/right-top/right-bottom, top/middle/bottom.\n\nSo if we take the analogy to the further extent, the question is whether Chinese can be read if the radicals were placed in a wrong arrangement. Further to complicate, when certain radicals are placed in certain spots, the form changes. For example the radical for heart if placed on the bottom is \u5fc3 but when placed on the left it becomes \u5fc4\n\nFor example \u6001 vs \u5ff2. They both have exactly the same radicals in a different arrangement, and they mean completely different things. The first one is one's emotional/mental state, the second means extravagance\n\nAlso \u674f vs\u56f0 vs \u5446 all same radicals. First is almonds, second is to restrain, third is to be blank. \n\nThere are many characters where this is not possible, but there exist characters that there are alternate arrangements that get different meanings. Hence the answer to this question posed by the OP is that it really depends on the character in play. There are some character that so obviously must be a particular character that no matter how you re-arrange it, people will know you made a typo, yet there are some that can be morphed into characters with a different meaning.",

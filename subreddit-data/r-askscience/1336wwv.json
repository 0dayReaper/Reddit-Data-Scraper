    "postText": "Talking about medical trials here. I've seen a few studies here and there relating to consumption of SSRIs, supplements, psylocibin, etc for treating anxiety and/or ADHD. Many of them are double blind studies where neither the doctor nor patient know if the patient is getting treatment or placebo, but every once in a while I'll come across an open label study, like [this one](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/company-on-brink-takes-psilocybin-to-trial-for-fragile-x-syndrome/).\n\nWhy do researchers bother with open label studies given the potential for placebo effects?",

            "comment": "There are several potential reasons for open label studies.  Off the top of my head.  \n  \n1.  Very early stage exploration.  Maybe they don't want to spend the money on a truly double-blind study to pay twice as many participants.  If an open-label study is promising, maybe some more money can be invested in a better, double-blind study.  \n  .\n2.  Ethics.  Sometimes, it wouldn't be ethical to give a participant a placebo.  This usually comes up for experimental medications in terminal illnesses.  The models say this new medication **should** work.  Who's going to tell half our terminal patients at the end of this, \"By the way, we had this drug that we thought would work, but we have you sugar pills because the experiment was more important than your life.\"  Those patients might disagree with that value judgment.)  \n  .\n3.  Obviousness of effect.  If the participants are going to figure out on their own that they are getting a sugar pill, there's no point.  This comes up with medications that have obvious effects that a participant will definitely notice are there or are absent.  Say, a known consciousness-altering drug is given out, and half the participants are tasting colors, while the other half feel nothing unusual.  The double-blind aspect of the study is negated.  \n  \nSource: took a course on drug studies done for the FDA.",

            "comment": "Early stage trials (phase I/II) are often open label.  You\u2019re just exploring for safety, dose optimization, regimen optimizing, and looking for a hint of any kind of activity.  But yes, in phase 3 trials, double blinded placebo control is the gold standard.  It is generally frowned upon to run single arm studies, etc.  It can be a very difficult problem though to run a well controlled study when the diseases might be extremely rare conditions where there just aren\u2019t enough people to run a phase 3 blinded study.  There are also a host of ethical issues giving someone who might die in a year or two from a horrible genetic condition the placebo.",

            "comment": "These are usually pilot studies with very little funding and are exploratory studues focused on side effects, biological effects rather than self reported efficacy. Blinding/placebo control can sometimes be skipped for ethical reasons too, when the primary outcome of the disease is death and not subject to placebo or response biases (which are a type of bias on scales/surveys).",

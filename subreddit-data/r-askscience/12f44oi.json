One speculation for the decreased number of chimp fossils is the environment of jungle (chimp/gorilla) vs. savannah (human) being less conducive for fossilization.\n\n\n~~The premise is incorrect.~~ We have fossil evidence for several prehistoric non-human apes and other primates They just don't get the notoriety as protohuman fossils.\n\nDryopithecus is a prehistoric ape, likely related to orangutans or African apes, although it could be related to humans, as it existed around the same time as gorillas split off.\n\nGigantopithecus was once thought to related to human, but is now thought to be related to orangutans.\n\nMegaladapis is a prehistoric giant lemur (not an ape) but it died out in the past 10,000 years.\n\nArchaeoindris is a gorilla sized lemur that went extinct around 2000 years ago.  There's a ton of prehistoric lemurs.\n\nAfropithecus is another African ape predecessor.\n\nMesopithecus and Oreopithecus are European ape ancestors, although they probably died out, since there aren't modern European apes (besides humans).\n\nAnything too old becomes hard to differentiate between protohuman and protoape. Chimps split off around 5 million years ago, and gorillas split off maybe 8 million years ago.",

The cause of speciation is selection (hence it being probably the most famous phrase in biology, \u201cthe *origin* of species by natural selection\u201d). Selection acts on variation produced by mutations and sexual reproduction when those variations have a non-zero correlation with reproductive success, and are heritable. What determines success is, in part, the geographic environment, so yes if you isolated a subset of the CHLCA (chimp-human LCA) population in a Savannah then selection would begin to reward those with traits more favorable to that environment, and speciation would occur. This is not unique to the case of the CHLCA divergence: it\u2019s basically a gist of all evolution.\n\nIn the case of the branching of the hominin lineage and *Pan* lineages, there was likely an extremely long span of hybridization, as this is the best explanation for why we get such vast ranges when using genetic modeling to estimate the original branching point (14-5mya is far too large a range for a branching event), and other well-established hominins branched off during this period, such as *Ardipithecus*. *Australopithecus* is generally defined as the first genus to arise after this divergence. Note that I\u2019m referring to the \u201cPan\u201d lineage to denote the branch that did not give rise to *Homo* several million years later, with the understanding that the actual genus *Pan* is still a long ways away. When you\u2019re dealing with several millions of years the implication is that any \u201clineage\u201d is going to span multiple species and usually genera as well.",

Perhaps a better way to get to where I wanted to go was with this question: what attributes that eventually led to Homo were more beneficial in a savannah environment than those that led to Pan?

Years ago I saw the process as definitive jumps between populations but, with the detail we get from the study of human evolution, the long and slow process of hybridization, admixture, etc. really makes the new species that much more interesting (to me as an amateur anyway).",

We are famous for running down prey over a long distance to tire it out before killing it, that probably became a feature that was selected for over millions of years. No doubt there are plenty more but I think that is a big one.\n\nYou would never need to chase down a meal over a long distance in the jungle. You would be chasing it up and around trees and stuff. But once we moved to the open savannah we needed to be able to walk it down over a long distance.\n\nEdit: spelling",

MacDougall basically lied about an indigenous Central American population, the Tarahumara, saying how they ran for miles and miles a day. In reality, they barely ever run, save for a specific ceremonial, soccer-like game played once a year.",

Discoveries in caves tend to yield more complete skeletons, but spelunking has its own dangers and difficulties and not all caves currently present were accessible hundreds of thousands of years ago.\n\nAnthropologists do indeed find chimp and gorilla ancestors, but a lot of the focus is on specifically human ancestors which will always make headlines.",

For example, hominin fossils have been found in regions with volcanic ash deposits or sediments that have turned into rock over time, which can preserve bones and teeth. In contrast, chimpanzees and gorillas tend to live in forested areas with acidic soils that do not preserve fossils well.\n\nAnother reason is that the pre-modern human lineage may have been more widespread and diverse than the pre-modern chimpanzee or gorilla lineages. Pre-modern humans, for example, lived in various habitats such as grasslands, forests, and savannas, and this may have contributed to a higher likelihood of fossilization.\n\nAdditionally, chimpanzees and gorillas have smaller ranges than humans, which means that there may have been fewer opportunities for their fossils to be preserved in the first place. Finally, it is also possible that pre-modern chimpanzee and gorilla fossils exist but have not yet been discovered due to factors such as limited fossilization potential, inadequate search efforts, or destruction of potential fossil sites.",

Anything dying and falling was most likely stripped of flesh and eaten by oxygenation before ever having laid long enough to fossilise. What actually needed to happen was it\u2019s death near water. So it fell and was very quickly covered over. Probably by silt. Because of this, they can be preserved in the land and the harder tissues can become fossils. This is really the fate of a tiny proportion of dead things. \n\nTo link to your question? Gorillas and chimps are prone to deeper jungle habitats and in the case of gorillas at least, not attacked at the waters edge. So they are even less likely to succumb to this state.\n\nEdit: typo",

            "comment": "The answer to your question is that fossils are not likely to occur. The vast majority of animals that die totally decay, rather than turning into rock. They have to die in very specific circumstances to fossilise - Be totally covered in sediments such as sand or mud before they decay, and stay that way until the sand/mud is buried deep enough that the pressure turns it into rock. This usually happens in areas that become underwater permanently where more sediment can fall on top of them, or where big mud slides occur. For terrestrial animals this is an unlikely event to occur. However, over millions of years it does happen enough that we find fossils of many terrestrial animals. But if you look at an organism that wasn't around for very long, we're not going to find many fossils. If you look specifically at chimpanzees or specifically at gorillas, neither have been around for a long period of time, and so there isn't that much chance of finding fossils. There's also way more research and interest in human fossils and our most direct or closely related to our direct ancestors than there is in the more distant cousins, so many fossils closely related to chimpanzees and gorillas are probably stored in museums and universities but will take a lot longer to be described.",

As other commenters who are more tuned into OPs question noted, just getting into a situation where one could be fossilized is a long shot but then to be found is just wild. As someone who works in genomics, I fully support the scientific paradigm and am super excited to see our ancestral tree including non-human apes likes chimps grow (one of my old TAs dug up Ardi), but a good scientist will tell you we don\u2019t know way more than we do.",

We still have huge gaps in our knowledge with many missing pieces. Evolution does happen and is ongoing - to what extent we have not incontrovertibly proven in every case but still have many working understandings - to the point that we accept it until something more convincing comes along, if it ever does.",

G and C hung out in forests and rarely went in caves. So much of Davidison homo is lost, we know more about them from DNA statistics than fossils. That indicates they didn't hang out in caves that we have found and excavated. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere is a cave in Kenya that gets elephants falling in, that would leave E fossils eventually, probably.",

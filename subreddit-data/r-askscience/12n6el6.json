    "postText": "I am curious as to how metals are purified both artificially and naturally.    I roughly know how alloys are formed, one melts down metals then mix them together and that forms an alloy that has different properties than the individual metals.   Stainless steel is a common example of an alloy.   And in nature we know that veins of pure, or almost pure, metals form which is where we mine them from.   So what is the process of refining or seperating metals from each other as opposed to combining one another?",

Turning bauxite into Alumina  using [The Bayer Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_process) has both chemical and mechanical components.    \n Heat is used a lot. \n\nSome impurities have lower boiling point then the metal you are trying to refine and so smoke off. Metals are usually found in the oxidised form so you also need an electron donor, like carbon monoxide, in a [smelter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smelting) .",

            "comment": "A lot of metals are purified in different ways..one of the most simplest separation is literally separating metals from ores using magnets...the rocks are crushed and metal is separated using a magnet then melted and used this is usually how metals are recycled other methods used are:\n1.Bayer's method: Used to separate aluminium from bauxite ore.\n2.Forth flotation process:\n Powdered ore is suspended into a tank containing water. Pine oil or xanthates (collector) and aniline or cresols (stabilizer) are added. A rotating paddle agitates the mixture and draws air in it. As a result froth is formed which carries the ore particles\nSulphur is purified in this method \n3.Roasting:\nThe process of heating the ore in the presence of excess of air to a high temperature below their melting point.\nBut when it's done in vacuum it's called calcination\nZinc is purified in this method \nSometimes even electricity is used to separate ores from slag(the impurities) molten iron is purified in this way\nSo basically there are hundreds of methods to purify metal \ud83d\ude01",

            "comment": "Iron is purified from iron oxide (often haematite) in a blast furnace using coal or coke as a carbon source, producing iron and CO2. It's further purified with things like calcium oxide and blowing oxygen through the liquid metal to remove excess carbon.\n\nAluminium and other more reactive metals have to be separated from compounds by electrolysis.\n\nNoble metals are unreactive enough to be found in metal form rather than as compounds. Gold and platinum can be found in this way, so it depends on the metal.",

            "comment": "As others have selaid, it depends on the metal.\n\nIron is almost always found in an oxidized state.  So the oxygen must be removed from it.  One way this is done is to superheat it with a carbon-rich fuel, which robs the oxygen atom from the iron to form carbon dioxide, and pure iron, the latter of which coalesces at the bottom of the furnace.\n\nSome metals, such as gold, are often found naturally alloyed with other metals and in this case you could use an acid which dissolves one metal but not the other, leaving you with one solid metal and one metal in solution.",

            "comment": "Probably the most impactful method is smelting.  Smelting is a metallurgical process that involves the extraction of metal from its ore by heating the ore to a high temperature, causing the metal to separate from the impurities and form a molten liquid. The smelting process is often used to extract copper, iron, lead, and zinc, among other metals.\n\n\r  \nIn nature, \"smelting\" occurs too as geologic activity exposes ore to different temperatures and pressures.\n\n\r\r\r  \nThe impurities in the ore can include non-metallic minerals, such as quartz and feldspar, as well as other metals that are not wanted in the final product. By melting the ore and separating the metal from the impurities, smelting purifies the metal and makes it suitable for further processing.\r  \n\r  \nThe effects of smelting on purifying metal can be significant, as the process can remove a large percentage of the impurities present in the ore. Depending on the specific metal and ore being processed, smelting can result in a product that is up to 99% pure. This high level of purity is important for many applications, as impurities can weaken the metal or cause it to corrode more quickly.\r  \n\r  \nIn addition to purifying the metal, smelting can also be used to extract valuable metals from low-grade ores. For example, copper can be extracted from ores that have a low copper content by smelting the ore and concentrating the copper in the resulting liquid metal. This allows companies to extract metals from ores that would not be economically viable to process using other methods.",

    "postText": "I was reading about the Queen of the Night flower, blooming one night per year. Other flowers can be similarly fickle in their appearances. What is the reproductive strategy these plants are utilizing by being so fleeting? Blooming at night makes me think pollinated by moths or something, but why not for multiple days? Is this what happens when pollination is all but guaranteed, so why waste the effort to maintain a flower?",

            "comment": "This post is written as if the queen of the night flower produces one flower on one night each year. This is not the case; while individual flowers last only one night, a single plant can produce multiple flowers per year, which may or may not bloom on the same night. \n\nOthers have made some good general points, but I will add some specifics for this plant:\n\nBeing a cactus, maintaining an open flower during the day is very expensive in terms of energy and water. Moths and bats are its prime pollinators, and they can be attracted from quite a distance away-- you will almost certainly smell the flower before you see it.",

I have several of these, and while each bloom lasts only one night, they can have many blooms in a year, and they do tend to cluster together.  There will be months at a time with no blooms, but then a group of buds will synchronize and all bloom the same night.  (They smell amazing and the flowers are as big as my open hand, too!)",

A common piece of advice for first-time growers of Venus Flytraps is to pinch off any flower stalks. Novice growers are less likely to have healthy plants, and allowing them to bloom may be what pushes the plant over the edge and kills it. Even healthy VFTs that are allowed to bloom may have stalled growth for a few weeks afterwards due to low energy stores.",

By flowering once, it seems like you would limit some of that. You only have to bribe once if you bribe at all some of the dead meat smelling ones dont pay for pollination. and while you might attract more pests that night, than a normal flower, you wouldnt be attracting them so often. This is just supposition but it seems like there could be many benefits to flowering only once as long as its effective at spreading your genes.",

For some reason everyone thinks they\u2019re qualified to spitball about evolutionary biology, more than any other field it seems.\n\nThere is no forward trajectory or understanding in evolution. Just mutation, which is random in occurrence and location in the genome, and the effect of selection and drift on the frequency those mutations in the population. It might seem like species are reaching towards a preset goal, but this is an illusion that comes about from the fact that environments don\u2019t tend to change that quickly, so the general designs and strategies that are successful are generally pretty stable on the scale of individual generations.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the process of natural selection doesn\u2019t involve or reach towards what is objectively \u201cmost\u201d successful (ie with a conscious design space), but rather what is more successful *relative* to the rest of your population. Selection doesn\u2019t create its own tweaks to the design, it relies on mutation for that, so the tweaks are random and almost always neutral or detrimental.",

Telomeres are \"caps\" on the chromosomes which act somewhat like aglets on a shoe lace, they protect the bulk of the chromosome from erosion occurring from the end. Every time a cell divides the telomeres are eroded a little and the DNA replication complex does not reach the end (for assorted technical reasons). \n\nAssuming this DNA replication shortening is a somewhat fixed length at each cell division then it could be used as a very accurate clock for how long a growing plant has been alive.\n\nThe telomeres are reset to their full length in the plant gametes (seeds/pollen) and the growing meristems, this means that both new plants or any new branches have full length telomeres. If telomere length is used as such a clock any signal would have to originate from the very earliest part of the stem/roots to grow from the seed, and it couldn't arise from distal parts of the plants whose telomere length has been reset",

It only blooms for one night, but can sometimes produce multiple flowers which all bloom the same night. With the right conditions it can also produce another set of blooms in about a month. The bloom opening is very light sensitive. If the bloom starts to open (which usually happens about 930 or 10 pm) and I turn on the porch light, it will start to close. I\u2019ve always suspected that it is intended to be pollinated by bats, mainly because the open bloom is so large, about the size of a fully finger\u2019s outstretched man\u2019s hand. The light sensitivity suggests it is synchronized with the moon\u2019s dark phase which might also suggest some moth/insect species that tends to forage more on the darkest nights",

Just mutation, which is random in occurrence and location in the genome, and the effect of selection and drift on the frequency those mutations in the population. It might seem like species are reaching towards a preset goal, but this is an illusion that comes about from the fact that environments don\u2019t tend to change that quickly, so the general designs and strategies that are successful are generally pretty stable on the scale of individual generations. There are of course instances of rapid change in an otherwise stable state over evolutionary time, which is called punctuated equilibrium. Different branches of the eukaryotic domain of life behave very differently when it comes to how quickly they seem to evolve, and it\u2019s a very complex scenario to detangle.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the process of natural selection doesn\u2019t involve or reach towards what is objectively \u201cmost\u201d successful (ie with a conscious design space), but rather what is more successful relative to the rest of your population. Selection doesn\u2019t create its own tweaks to the design, and it cannot make intelligent choices to fit a given niche. It relies on mutation, which again is randomly occurring and randomly distributed, so the tweaks are accordingly random and almost always neutral or detrimental.",

The domain of all possible phenotypes is infinite. What is observed in any population under HW equilibrium is simply the most successful of those random reaches into that infinite design space.\n\n&gt;\tso it makes perfect sense to consider what advantages it may have. More so if the trait occurs in unrelated plants but is unevenly distributed geographically. (Like being more common in dry areas.)\n\nAll plants are related, and their molecular biology is pretty highly conserved. What you\u2019re describing is one of several criterion for categorizing a trait as adaptive, and to a lesser extent general convergence, and it\u2019s not incorrect but it\u2019s not relevant to actual question here, which is generalized as *why* some population hasn\u2019t developed some trait yet.",

Somewhere inside those dolls are rigorous test procedures but each subsequent claim is completely independent.\n\n[International Units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit) for bioactive compounds are used to compare the *effectiveness* of similar forms of the same substance.  For instance, comparing Vitamin A from supplier 1 versus supplier 2.\n\nA standard assay is defined for that compound and everyone else uses the same technique and even same machines.  They find the \"best\" and most \"stable\" preparation and that is the International Standard for That Compound only.  All subsequent preparations are done using the same test and it's a percentage versus the \"best\" sample defined earlier.  \n\nInsulin has a standard test method called *NIBSC code: 83/500*, which stands for *National Institute for Biological Standards and Control. World Health Organisation, 2nd International Standard: Insulin, Human.*  Reason for 2nd is the first standard was all used up and they needed to make a new reference batch.\n\n[Insulin is a bioactive substance with a 1 IU insulin \u2259 SI units of 0.0347 mg human insulin](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6501531/).  But insulin is a protein and can have different masses depending on the supplier and it can even change over time.  Hence, the need to compare *effectiveness* of any new or batch of insulin versus some standard reference insulin sample.\n\nThe main ISO standard is ISO 9001 or quality management.  Are you making what your procedures say you are, how do you define training procedures, do you have procedures to detect problems in your protocol.\n\nNext is ISO 17025 or laboratory management.  Again, it's not a true empirical standard such as metres or Celsius, it's asking laboratories to prove they calibrate their machines, include statistical errors, are they able to prove they aren't forging data, etc.",

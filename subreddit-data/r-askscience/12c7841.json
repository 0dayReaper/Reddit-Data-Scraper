    "postText": "The water bottles we buy has an expiration date. Reading online it says it's not for water but more for the plastic in the bottle which can contaminate the water after a certain period of time. \nSo my question is, say we use a glass airtight bottle and store our mineral water there. \nWill that water ever expire given it's kept at the average room temperature for the rest of eternity?",

            "comment": "Water is a very stable compound so it won't ever expire.  Pure water contains no nutrients or calories for bacteria to feed off of, for instance, neither does water ever spontaneously split into hydrogen and oxygen - that requires substantial energy input.\nHowever, water is a rather powerful solvent, especially over long periods.  Many minerals and nutrients, including those of which many commonly used containers are made, will readily dissolve into it, thus rendering the water impure.\nIf kept in a perfectly non-soluble and airtight container - that is, if kept away from literally anything it could possibly ever react with, it should remain pure and unspoiled forever.",

For our purposes here, any tests we do involving water will come straight from a deionized filtered tap.  This is for applications like total dissolved solids parts per million, pH, titration, turbidity, et cetera.  We have pretty strict criteria for not using water that is being stored in any kind of container for this reason.  Other applications might not be as stringent.",

Our facility De-Ionized Water (DI) was circulated in steel piping. It was a while ago, so I couldn't tell you what grade of stainless.\n\nOnce a week we would flush every single port in the DI system and take a water sample to test pH, conductivity, and Total Organic Carbon (TOC). If a sample was out of specification (OOS), the port would be flushed and a new sample would be tested.\n\nAnnually, (or if there were repeat OOSs) the DI lines would be cleaned and passivated. Sections could be isolated, and any necessary seals would be changed. The lines would flush, a surfactant would be circulated to remove anything that got into the line and flushed. Then 1 molar nitric acid would be circulated, this would strip everything in the pipe down to the metal surface, flush. Then 1 molar sodium hydroxide would circulate, this would ensure a consistent protective oxide layer on all of the metal, flush.",

It's probably a good idea to avoid huffing dryer lint, and to make an effort to choose tap instead of bottled if available, but not enough of a difference to stress about it.\n\nFrom a pollution reduction standpoint, avoiding bottled water is a good choice, but that too, is an umbrella in a hurricane when manufacturers will keep pumping^lol out bottled water regardless.\n\nDoesn't mean it's pointless as an individual to reduce, reuse, and recycle, but by and large the most meaningful way to make a dent in microplastics is to legislate against their production in the first place.",

Some things like glass don't dissolve very easily but it's possible that different types of glass have different time periods where the water will still be safe to drink.

It was thicker in the center than on the outside edges so windows cut from it were not completely flat.\n\nGlass in the 19th century used a cylinder method mostly where they made a glass cylinder and then heated up that cylinder in a furnace so it naturally flattened by gravity.  it was more consistent than earlier methods but not completely",

Just pointing out that some people think that way (something I encountered very recently, to my surprise, actually).  \n\nAs to the H4SiO4 solubility issue, the pH of the water has a big role.  Neutral pH is effectively insoluble to SiO2 (as H4SiO4=SiO2+2H2O).  Maximum concentration has a U-shaped pH dependence, so either really acidic or really caustic water can accept quite a bit of SiO2, which is presumably how so much silica moves around in the earth system (why quartz is such a common vein mineral).",

Either you would have a drastic shift to a new equilibrium or things would die off.\n\nThere's a type of flow cell you can set up called a biostat where you add a bit of new material and remove a bit of old material at the same time and the culture will be mostly stable for a really long time as long as you maintain the light and temperature. \n\nIn reality what tends to happen is that something else gets in there and radically disrupts things. Either a bacteriophage or a bacteria or mould starts secreting a toxin that kills off other stuff. If you don't have enough biodiversity, that can kill things off.\n\nThis basically happens in every discrete biological niche on the planet. Every surface you can think of is covered in a lawn of microorganisms unless there's something about that surface that kills things.

    "postText": "What I mean is I have a hypothesis.\n\nEuarchontoglires were apparently originally obligate omnivores: that explain why some of them are great scavengers, and why they can tolerate MUCH MORE ethanol, caffeine and theobromine than almost all other animals. To be exact, all apes (such as gibbons and humans), rabbits, squirrels, murids (such as brownn rats and house mice), cricetids (such as hamsters), and caviids (such as Guinea pigs and capybaras) can all drink coffee, and eat chocolate, for many other animals, they are very toxic (just ask birds, squamates, felines, canids, and even equids). Euarchontoglires that are omnivores with carnivorous tendancies include mandrills, baboons, aye-ayes, and water rats. Euarchontoglires that are omnivores with herbivorous tendencies include gorillas, lemurs, and squirrels. Euarchontoglires that really are obligate omnivores include anatomically modern humans, chimpanzees (both common chimpanzees and bonobos formerly known as pygmy chimpanzees), pen-tailed treeshrews, hamsters, brown rats, and house mice. The only Euarchontoglires that are obligate carnivores I know are tarsiers, and the only Euarchontoglires I know that are obligate herbivores I know are caviids, beavers, and mole-rats.\n\nAlso, most Euarchontoglires are small: the world's largest extant Euarchontoglires species is either the anatomically modern human (*Homo sapiens*) (if we are talking about both height, and legspan), or the eastern gorilla (*Gorilla beringei*) (if we are talking about mass, volume, and armspan), or the tetraploid rodent (I forgot its scientific name, sorry) (if we are talking about genome size). If we include extinct species, there was a South American rodent that weighed 1,000 kilograms, or even more, and maybe *Gigantopithecus blacki* was 2.4-3.6 metres tall with a mass of 350-1,000 kilograms.\n\nFinally, Euarchontoglires tend to be gregarious (such as rabbits, beavers, and gibbons), or alternatively prosocial (such as capybaras, brown rats, house mice, lemurs, gorillas, and chimpanzees), or even eusocial (such as mole-rats, and, in a sense, humans). Among the exceptions, there are orangutans (which are solitary in an on and off manner), and hamsters (which are obligate solitary). However, some Euarchontoglires are pacifists (such as bonobos, gorillas, orangutans, capybaras, and Guinea pigs), other are warriors (such as brown rats, house mice, baboons, mandrills, common chimpanzees, and humans) (I sometimes say that, in comparison to humans, orangutans are autistic empaths, and hamsters are schizophrenic sociopaths).\n\nDo you agree with me? Why or why not? Thanks.",

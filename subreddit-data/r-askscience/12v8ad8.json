            "comment": "Tornadoes need two ingredients to form: strong vertical wind shear (i.e., the wind changes rapidly as you go up in altitude) and strong vertical motions.  Venus appears to have little of either.  On Earth and Mars, dust devils are formed because the sun heating the surface creates plumes of hot and buoyant air, which as it rises \"converts\" the vertical wind shear into horizontal wind shear, resulting in a small vortex.  Tornadoes are formed in a similar way, but in that case, the ascending plumes of buoyant air are caused by deep convection in a thunderstorm, which can result in much more powerful vortices: tornadoes.\n\nVenus is covered in clouds, and it seems unlikely to me that you would get the same kind of convection at the surface that you do with clear-sky atmospheres on the Earth and Mars that lead to dust devils.  There are indeed large convection cells in the Venusian atmosphere due to solar heating of the atmosphere itself, but they seem to be high up in the clouds and not at the surface.  Venus has very few \"condensible,\" which by their release of latent heat give rise to deep moist convection (water vapor condensing into liquid water and releasing latent heat plays this role in a terrestrial thunderstorm) Venus also does not have strong vertical wind shear, particularly at the surface.  Thus I think anything like a dust devil or tornado is probably quite rare, if not completely absent, on Venus.\n\nA lot of people are commenting about Venus' polar vortex, which is totally unrelated to a tornado.  Polar vortices are common features of planetary atmospheres and result from the planetary-scale circulation of the atmosphere.  Tornadoes and dust devils are several orders of magnitude smaller in scale and are transient features.  One interesting feature of the Venusian atmosphere is that the solid planet rotates extremely slowly, so slowly that there is no appreciable Coriolis force.  Thus the atmospheric dynamics on Venus is very different from that of Earth and the other planets with significant atmospheres.  The atmospheres of Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are littered with cyclones, anticyclones, and jet streams, all of which rely on a balance between pressure gradients and the Coriolis force (geostrophic dynamics).  But on Venus the primary balance is between pressure gradients and the centrifugal force (cyclostrophic balance), which leads to very different dynamics. In addition, as I mentioned earlier Venus does not really have moist convection, which means that there are not really any storms (depending on how you define the word \"storm\").",

                            "comment": "Yeah, the former mostly.  The fact that there is a very thick permanent cloud layer really changes the vertical distribution of solar heating compared to the Earth or Mars.  Since tornadoes are such small-scale features, the Coriolis force is basically irrelevant for their dynamics, and so you could conceivably have them on a slowly-rotating planet.\n\nI included the last paragraph to highlight some of the large-scale differences between Venus and Earth, Jupiter, etc. and why a large vortex =/= a tornado.  I think a lot of people confuse storms (which usually involve deep moist convection and strong vertical motions) with vortices (which are just rings of wind, so to speak).  On Earth there is often an association between cyclonic vortices and storms, such as hurricanes or extratropical cyclones, thus some immediately think vortex=storm. But the less well-known anticyclones on Earth are the opposite, they generally inhibit storms.  So although there can be a relationship between storms and vortices, it doesn't always hold. The same goes for vortices on the giant planets like the Great Red Spot: it's an anticyclone and although there are often thunderstorms around and inside it, the vortex is not being sustained by storms like a terrestrial hurricane.",

                    "comment": "Hi - these are all reasonable points, but I can supplement them with new information.   \nFor Venus cloud-level processes in particular, it is interesting to note that sulphuric acid has a much lower latent heat of evaporation than water (by a factor of 4) so latent heat is much less a driver of moist convection in Venus cloud level compared to Earth. There still would be moist convection, though, because the main cloud deck is heated from below by radiant heating from the deep atmosphere, and cooled above by thermal IR radiation to space. (see  Lebonnois et al [https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JE004794](https://doi.org/10.1002/2015JE004794) \\- open access). When the Soviet Vega balloons were deployed in the cloud level of Venus, they experienced vertical winds reaching even 2-3 m/s; this is still afar less than what one might experience in a tornado, but still evidence of vertical winds in the clouds. (original papers are not open access but here's a figure from a recent reprocessing by Ralph Lorenz [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2017.12.044](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2017.12.044) describing it [https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0019103517303640-gr4.jpg](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0019103517303640-gr4.jpg))    \nAs to your second paragraph, recent modelling shows that the small amount of sunlight which does reach the surface is in fact likely to lead to significant convective activity in the lowest few km of the atmosphere (the \"Planetary Boundary Layer\"). This is described in [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2018.06.006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2018.06.006) (not open access, but the summary will give you the idea!)  \n\n\nThis has led to recent research applying a high-resolution turbulence resolving dynamical model ('Large Eddy Simulation') to the expected conditions found in the Venus Planetary Boundary Layer. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2022.115167](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.icarus.2022.115167) (open access; Maxence Lefevre et al. 2022). This does find that convective vortices (more akin to dust devils than to tornadoes) should indeed be likely. See their nice figure [https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S001910352200269X-gr6.jpg](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S001910352200269X-gr6.jpg) ; the right-hand panel shows pressure transient field, the dark dots show the pressure drops associated with the cores of these convective vortices.   \n\n\nIn summary, Venus won't have tornadoes like Earth's tornadoes, but it will have interesting cloud-level convection, and could well have convective vortices at its surface! If the convective vortices were to lift loose surface materials then they could become true 'dust devils'. The upcoming Venus missions from NASA and ESA won't be able to observe these dust devils, for that one would want long-duration meteorological stations to the surface of Venus - like these ones [https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/09\\_psds3\\_saeve.pdf](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/09_psds3_saeve.pdf) .",

It's only like being ~900 m under water. The first lander, Venera 7, was designed for pressures up to 180 atmospheres (and temperatures up to 540 C) but the surface pressure was found to be only half that (and the temperature 60 degrees cooler, too), so later Soviet landers were not as overengineered.\n\nCorrosion-resistant mateirals for atmospheric craft aren't that big a deal either. Balloons did float through the acidic atmosphere for a couple of days in the 1980s before their batteries ran out. Acid is a complete non-issue on the surface. There is no sulfuric acid below ~30 km altitude. It evaporates because of the heat.\n\nModern SiC (silicon carbide) electronics can operate indefinitely at Venus surface temperatures. NASA has successfully tested small prototype \"cube landers\" for thousands of hours under Venus surface conditions.\u00a0[The LLISSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Lived_In-situ_Solar_System_Explorer)\u00a0was part of a collaboration with Russia, in which they would have been a payload on Venera D. So that's definitely not happening any time soon.\n\nhttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20180004539/downloads/20180004539.pdf\n\nhttps://www.universetoday.com/137803/building-electronics-can-work-venus/\n\nThe limiting technological factor for unmanned surface operations is more in regard to power. So far, all landers and atmospheric probes on Venus have been battery powered. The landers wouldn't have lasted much longer anyway, even if the heat didn't get to them. There are ways to generate power on the surface, but not very efficient in terms of power per mass or power per area.\n\nHigh temperature RTGs and to some extent (during the long \"twilight\" of day, not the long night) solar are possible, though at best not great. The small LLISSE devices could have been powered for months by batteries, but a wind powered version was also planned. Venus surface winds are slow, if fairly steady, but at least the atmosphere is dense (unfortunately, velocity is more important than density, so it's still not that great).",

It's because this academic work is very new (2022) and not possible to directly confirm using pat data, due to the almost complete lack of surface meteorological measurements from the surface of Venus.\n\nAtmospheric modelling of small-scale processes like turbulence &amp; convective vortices had barely been performed on Venus because of the difficulty of operating surface stations on Venus. This is changing though; new high temperature could make small uncooled surface stations feasible.

Take some imaginary shell around the planet that has Euler characteristic equal to 2 and you get the same result on that surface. The actual objection is that there is a far cry from a 2d vertex on some cross-section of the atmosphere and any phenomenon which you might dub a tornado.",

            "comment": "While, no bacteria can grow in high concentrations of alcohol. There are some bacteria that are highly resistant to being killed by alcohol. These include the genera mycobacterium and clostridium. In the hospital setting we often encounter Clostridium Difficile (c. diff).  This organism is highly resistant to antibiotics. It can cause opportunistic infections in the intestines when the normal flora is killed off by antibiotics. When we are treating patients who have c. diff infections, we have to wash our hands with soap and water, instead of using hand sanitizer. Because, the alcohol in hand sanitizer does not effectively kill c diff.",

            "comment": "Alcohol is never found in Greater concentrations in nature, so there is no bacteria that have evolved to tolerate for example 70% concentrated ethyl alcohol, which is what we use to disinfect in the lab.\nSome species are much more tolerant tho, and several can survive 96% ethyl alcohol actually. But that is more because the alcohol basically denatures the cell wall and creates a hard shell before it can dehydrate the cell.",

These concentrations are called bacteriostatic or mycostatic because microorganisms do not grow or replicate. To be bactericide or mycocide (that is to kill organisms) you need concentrations of 70% to 80%.",

In reality, the reason beer made from unclean water was safe to drink was because part of the process of making beer involves heating it up to or past boiling. *That's* what kills the bacteria, not the ~2-3% ABV of beer at the time.",

            "comment": "For a more chemical perspective on why you would expect ethanol to destroy an organism you have to appreciate what gives proteins their ability to form the tertiary (3D) structure - and consequently - perform their function. \n\nProteins (with a few exceptions perhaps) work in a very narrow range of temperatures and in one solvent (water). It's a careful balance of entropic (distribution of energy) and enthalpic factors (amount of energy) that keep them going. For example, if you heat things up too much and get the atoms jiggling and wiggling, some structure might break away from where it's meant to be, breaking the protein. \n\nEqually, you could have a lack of water somewhere in the structure; and perhaps some key hydrogen bonds that would achieve the same sort of denaturation as heating would occur if these  waters were to be removed. If this happens to every protein in the organism, or even a few key ones to a slight degree, best prepare for a very tiny funeral. \n\nAs other people have pointed out, this sort of destabilisation will occur in cell membranes/walls and achieve the same result.\n\n\n(In reality waters role in protein stabilisation is (chiefly) something termed the 'hydrophobic effect', which is to do with the entropy changes with water associating with itself, versus a hydrophobic protein residue, and so those residues are preferentially found in the interior of protiens i.e. the water is forcing it to take a certain shape. This is an extraneous detail though and I think the main concept is conveyed with the hydrogen bond example.)",

            "comment": "Bacterial cellwalls exploit the fact that water and fat dont mix to create the inside and outside environment of the cell. Imagine an old stone bridge. It works as long as the weight of the stones are pushing it down. Without gravity its gets pulled apart. Ethanol alcohol loves both fat and water and so there is no more tension holding the cell wall together and it floats away. \n\nTLDR; because bacterias are bridges.",

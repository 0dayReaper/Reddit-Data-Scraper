In English, if the unit of measure is the same, you don\u2019t have to include it on both numbers. If it were 55 Hz to 25 kHz, that\u2019s a different unit of measure.\n\nPeople would also understand if they said \u201c55 kHz to 25\u201d, but that sounds weird in English, because the unit goes after the number. \n\nIt works the same way if they used a dash instead of the word \u201cto\u201d, like \u201c55\u201325 kHz\u201d, but most writers know that it is easy to confuse that dash with the subtraction minus sign, so they use the word \u201cto\u201d.\n\nAnd usually, you\u2019d put the smaller number first, but they say \u201csweep\u201d, which specifically means going in a certain direction (up or down) over time.",

They discovered that while there was a change in frequency as the bats accelerated forward, the change would zero out on the back swing. The obvious explanation; bats don't fly backwards, so they don't do it then.",

I did notice tens of times, that Pipistrellus Pygmaeus pauses it's hunting for a short while when a bike comes a long that rattles loudly in the same 40kHz band. Some sports bikes rattle loudly, in a broad spectrum, when the rider freewheels and those in particular causes the bats to pause.\n\n(It's funny how no one notices the many bats flying between the people, while hunting under the street lights.)",

Like when you sit in a cinema and somebody is talking, you may not hear what they say in the movie, but you wouldn't be confused as to who said what.",

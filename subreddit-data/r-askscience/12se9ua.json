            "comment": "The most important reason was implementation of quarantines that stopped the spread of the disease. Improvement in sanitation and personal hygiene during this period also helped. That being said, people died of the plague for centuries after the initial wave, but nothing like the first wave. Part of the reason might be that Yersinia pestis at this time was too deadly, and simply died out as a consequence. Additionally, some people developed immunity to the disease.",

            "comment": "I'm reading a terrific book right now which explores the impact of infectious illness upon human evolution, culture, history and society.   It's called Plagues Upon the Earth.    [https://www.amazon.com/Plagues-upon-Earth-Princeton-Economic/dp/069119212X](https://www.amazon.com/Plagues-upon-Earth-Princeton-Economic/dp/069119212X)\n\nI have the impression that when the bubonic plague infected a community, resulting in mortality rates which varied between 30%-ish to well over 50%-ish according to some reports, the pathogen burned out its human fuel and the survivors were either curiously resistant, lucky or acquired immunity from having endured infection.  But the pathogen would still exist in a disease reservoir, emerging again and again.  The Black Death of 14th century had been preceded by the Justinian Plague around 500AD and it appears there had been instances of plague prior to that time.  There were recurrent outbreaks for centuries, some of which were localized, some of which were large scale plague events.  Eventually we've become much better at managing the vector organism, the black rat.  But...it could certainly return as a public health threat.\n\nCan't say enough good things about the above-cited book.  The author is a history professor from Oklahoma and, before writing this book, he was best known for his expertise in Roman history.   He walks through all of the classes of pathogens, their mechanism of causing disease, impact upon human history, trends in public health--it's a great read if you're into icky descriptions of bacteria, worms and viruses.",

            "comment": "(from an evolutionary microbiologist who works with algae but majored in parasitology)\n\nIt evolved. It is still around and there is a localized outbreak from time to time but even without antibiotic treatment it is much less serious.\n\nGenerally, a parasite that kills its hosts too quickly is at a disadvantage because it has less opportunities to spread to new hosts and keep reproducing.\n\nStrains that are less pathogenic allow their hosts to live longer and carry them further and to more naive hosts and therefore compete out the strains that don't. So do lineages that are highly transmittable but in order for this strategy to work long term they also have to tone down the pathogenicity because they ultimately need to spread outside their endemic population (and dead or very sick host will not carry them very far) or allow long term survival and evolve to be able to reinfect non-naive hosts and/or form dormant lifestages if the population is isolated (and would soon become saturated with hosts the parasite cannot infect).\n\nMost illnesses act like crazy when they first emerge and naturally evolve towards lower pathogenicity. We kind of see the same scenario with covid that was much more lethal during the first wave, did not seem to be able to reinfect people who already had it for some time, later had a wave of highly transmittable strain and gradually kind of calmed down. Unfortunatelly, it doesn't care, evolutionarily speaking, about what chronic damage it causes (at least not yet).",

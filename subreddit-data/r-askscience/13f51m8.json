Thinking of nitrites, sulfites, sodium benzoate, benzoic acid, etc., chemical preservatives that would have only shown up in the last 2-300 years.",

            "comment": "[Nitrates and nitrites were used in antiquity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0015626475901571), either as naturally-occurring contaminants in salt sources, as an additive (\"saltpeter\", which is calcium nitrate) or possibly created through heat and chemical reactions (\"toasted salt\" used in Roman meat-curing may have transformed naturally-occurring nitrates into nitrites). Saltpetre remained a popular ingredient through the 1800s, when the developing science of chemistry was able to identify what saltpetre actually was and expand our understanding of nitrates and nitrites as a whole.\n\n[Sulfur dioxide was used by the Romans for fumigation](https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-ancient-traditions/sulfur-0018091) in public places, burning sulfur to prevent the spread of disease in a gathering area. Like many ancient practices, we're not sure where this got started specifically, but it was used in large areas like the Senate House. The Romans may have later adapted this practice to winemaking...and although Pliny the Elder wrote about this practice, [there is some debate about whether it happened or how widespread it was](https://www.meiningers-international.com/wine/general/debate-over-sulfites). By 1664, [burning sulfur candles in bottles had been adapted to wine- and cider-making in Europe](https://archive.org/details/sylvaordiscourse00eveluoft/page/24/mode/2up?ref=ol&amp;view=theater). Our very earliest written mention of it merely references how useful everyone knows it is, so it had probably been happening for longer and simply not written down.\n\nAgain, once chemistry had developed as an actual science, it was possible for chemists to isolate what \"burned sulfur\" actually was, and begin to understand and test the effects it had on food and spoilage.\n\nAs to sodium benzoate/benzoic acid, those are more recent. Salicylic acid was being used in the 1870s for medical benefits related to fevers and rheumatism; [German scientists were trying to extract salicylic acid themselves](https://books.google.es/books?id=iBcAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA57&amp;redir_esc=y), but their extract was giving people internal bleeding, diarrhea, and/or death. Looking for an easier-to-synthesize chemical analogue to salicylic acid, [German scientist Hugo Fleck in 1875 isolated sodium benzoate](https://books.google.es/books/about/Benzo%C3%ABs%C3%A4ure_Carbols%C3%A4ure_Salicyls%C3%A4ure.html?id=sv0YKfsJVeIC&amp;redir_esc=y), a sodium salt of benzoic acid. Although his original paper is in German and I can't really read it, it was adapted as a preservative relatively soon thereafter; when the United States established the FDA in 1906, sodium benzoate was among the first substances the agency approved.\n\nHopefully some of this was useful in answering your question!",

It was so valuable when it was the only show in town for preserving things, that folk would fight over the stuff. Any time you have a commodity that valuable, people will search for alternatives that permit the same performance without using the expensive material.",

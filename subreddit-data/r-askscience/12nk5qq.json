    "postText": "I analyzed recent scientific articles on the effect of parental age on the probability of producing a healthy kid: https://empirical-wonderland.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-effect-of-parental-age-on.html\n\nHowever, I am not a biologist or a doctor myself. If anybody is also interested in this topic or has more knowledge on the subject, please have a look at my summary and let me know if you find any errors or disagree with me. Any comments are appreciated.\n\nIn a nutshell, I found that the probability of a woman getting pregnant in one year of trying (sex every 3 days) drops from 86% (at 20 years old) to 53% (at 40 years old). The probability of miscarriage also increases from 10% to 25%, while the probability of a birth defect rises from 1% to 15%, with an acceleration in this trend after the age of 40.\n\nFor men, the effects of age were less pronounced. The probability of making a woman pregnant within a year decreases by approximately 10% after the age of 40, compared to the age of 30. However, older men also tend to have less sex than younger ones. After 40, men increase the probability of miscarriage by 1.23 times (how I understood, it increases from 10% to 12% for a partner in her 20s, but this could be wrong) compared to 25-29. Finally, advanced paternal age has a significant positive effect on the rate of birth defects. However, the rate is generally low. For example, orofacial clefts have a probability lower than 0.2%. For fathers over 45, this probability is up to 0.3%.",

            "comment": "Thoughts of a medical doctor here: \n\nThere\u2019s probably presentation bias in your summary. Women at advanced age are more likely to have health insurance, health care and seek care. Their pregnancies are likely more intentional. \n\nYou\u2019ll have less miscarriages at a younger age simply because you\u2019ll have more abortions, and also because your miscarriages may be less frequent due to less birth defects that don\u2019t carry to term, a driving force in the miscarriages as well. \n\nYoung women are probably less likely to report miscarriages they had or get documented healthcare at all related to non-term/early  miscarriage pregnancy. \n\nYounger women\u2019s bodies may also better clear miscarriages from the uterus without intervention and so never realize they were pregnant at all and just think they had an irregular or heavy menses. \n\nThere are so many reasons for the variations in the statistics, but there are certainly statistically significant differences by age not explained simply by presentation bias. I was just pointing out a factor that might artificially distance the reported figures. \n\nIt\u2019s generally thought though that 1/5 to 1/4 of all pregnancies end in miscarriage, not just in the older population. Older women may also be more inclined to carry a fetus with a known birth defect to term because of difficulty conceiving and desire to have a child.",

            "comment": "I was actually seeking information on this recently and found [this meta-analysis ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4455614/) on the effect of age on paternal fertility and sperm quality. It's quite the dense summary, I read it for my interest on the increased risk of schizophrenia as our risk factors are already elevated.\n--Summary: \"Several studies have demonstrated the effects of increasing paternal age on various molecular mechanisms such as DNA mutations, chromosomal aberrations and epigenetic patterns. This molecular aging process was shown to induce changes in reproductive hormones\u2019 profiles, decrease sperm quality parameters and contribute to male infertility. These alterations are also responsible for various types of congenital disorders and pregnancy outcomes such as spontaneous abortions and preterm births. Although a number of studies have been conducted to assess the negative effects involved with increasing paternal age, the molecular mechanisms which cause the effects are still poorly understood. It is proposed that further research should be conducted to demystify the mechanisms involved. The use of cutting-edge technologies mainly next-generation sequencing to study the relationship between aging and male infertility will build a framework for future studies on the molecular reproductive aging in order to design advanced male infertility diagnostic and therapeutic tools to delay the aging aforementioned negative effect. The identification of aging versus longevity-related genes will also help to predict the age impact on the reproductive function. Furthermore, it will be possible to accurately establish an \u2018Age Threshold\u2019which once crossed; a prospective father should attend a counselling session in which he should be educated about the risks involved with conceiving an offspring at old age.\"",

The rate of miscarriage starts off at about 12% for young women then rapidly increases to like 95% as menopause approaches. \n\nSee \"The high abortion cost of human reproduction\" https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/372193v1.full\n\nWhile young women have a better rate of biologically healthy offspring, waiting a few years to be a parent can result in better emotional health for parents and children.

    "postText": "Human hearts have two halves, one to pump blood around the lungs and another to pump blood around the rest of the body. Ok, makes sense, the oxygenation step is very important and there's a lot of tiny blood vessels to push blood through so a dedicated pumping section for the lungs seems logical.\n\nBut why are there two chambers per side? An atrium and a ventricle. The explanation we got in school is that the atrium pumps blood into the ventricle which then pumps it out of the heart. So the left ventricle can pump blood throughout the entire body and the left atrium only needs to pump blood *down* a couple of centimeters? That seems a bit uneven in terms of capabilities. \n\nDo we even need atria? Can't the blood returning from the body/lungs go straight into the ventricles and skip the extra step of going into an atrium that pumps it just a couple of centimeters further on?",

            "comment": "The reason is that [a four-chambered heart allows continuous inflow, while also allowing intermittent high-pressure pumped outflow.](http://cardiac-output.info/1967AHJ.pdf)\n\nIf you only had a two-chambered heart, every time a chamber pumped, you would need to seal off the inlet to that chamber (otherwise, the chamber would pump blood in both directions, forward and backward at the same time!) This would mean, for example, sealing off the vena cava for every single heartbeat, which would cause blood in the vena cava to stop moving completely (and back up) with every single heartbeat, which would be terribly inefficient.\n\nSo you introduce two \"waiting rooms\" for the pumping chambers, the atria. Blood can continuously flow into them, but the opening between them and the ventricle can be sealed for every ventricle-pump. So you have continuous inflow of blood, which can collect until the ventricle is ready to receive it...then the collected blood can be quickly (but more gently) pumped into the waiting ventricle, which can then forcefully pump that blood forward *while more blood collects in the atrium behind it*. Blood keeps moving, the ventricle spends less down-time waiting to fill with blood, and everybody wins!\n\n(Edited for readability.)",

I *think* the answer is because the ventricles only have an ejection fraction of about 50-60%. The reason I assume for not having ventricles the same volume as the atria with a 100% ejection fraction is to allow redundancy if there is damage to the ventricular musculature. I also suspect blood pressure differences during the heart beat account for some of the discrepancy too but interested in others' input.",

The reason why 100 percent ejection is bad is that at lower volumes the heart needs more contraction and force to squeeze out blood, think of how hard it is to squeeze out the last drops of tooth paste from an empty tube Vs squeezing out toothpaste from a full tube. \n\nThe harder the heart works to squeeze out blood, the thicker the muscle becomes, meaning it needs more oxygen and becomes more prone to ischemia. So it turns out the heart works most effeciently when the ejection fraction is 50-70.",

This produces something called the \"atrial kick\" which provides a little extra stretch to the verticals and helps them work more efficiently - it turns out that the heart muscle fibers contract better when stretched out a little further than passive filling alone would achieve. \n\n\nTo the other poster's point about continuous flow: this has at least as much to do, if not more to do, with the elasticity of the aorta and pulmonary arteries. They stretch during the heart's pump and then extract due to elastic fibers while the heart's outflow valves are closed. This produces continuous forward blood flow which is important for both brain and heart perfusion. You can see the effects of not having this in aortic regurgitation which produces a characteristic head bob as the brain blood flow accelerates and decelerates.",

The ventricle fills as much as it can, and then the atria squeeze and try to shove even more blood in. So it's not an i heremtly necessary step but it makes the heart more efficient by making sure every single beat of the ventricles is ejecting as much blood as possible. No wasted space",

Same as you don't need to maximally fill the ventricles if the heart just beats more often. So you can totally get away with not having atria\n\nBUT: eventually you'll get to the point where you are trying to move so many people that you can't finish filling the current train before the next one arrives. So adding even more trains doesn't increase the amount of people you can move.\n\nAt that point the only solution is to jam people into an already full train. Similarly, the heart can only beat so fast before it gets to the point where it can't go any faster because it takes time to fill up and then send the blood out. So if the body is demanding more blood flow and the heart can't beat any faster (or send any more trains) we only have one solution. Make sure every beat has as much blood in it as we can possibly squeeze in there",

It shuts the input valve, opens the output valve and contracts. The blood inside of it is squeezed out and goes... where, exactly?\n\nThe blood vessel loop is already full of blood at this stage. So squeezing more blood into it from one end should make the blood rush through the vessels, as new blood pushes out the old blood. Which is what we want, right? But that old blood needs somewhere to go to allow this to happen. The only place our simplified vascular system goes is... the heart. Which, if you recall, has its input side sealed. So, in reality, the answer is \"nowhere\".\n\nThis one-chambered heart is effectively pumping into a pipe sealed at one end. Like one of those long balloons that clowns use to make balloon animals. It's a more apt comparison than you'd think, too, because since blood is not compressible, the only thing that can really happen when the heart tries to force in more blood is that the vascular system inflates like a big long balloon. Parts of your real vascular system do this to some degree naturally, but not this extreme.\n\nOnce the heart has completed its compression stroke, it flips the valves and starts to relax. The blood vessels, now pressurized, squeeze the blood out of themselves back to the heart by way of their own elasticity. That is, the clown un-pinches the inflated balloon and it deflates.\n\nIf we add an atrium to this heart, this would completely change the dynamic. Now, when the ventricle pumps, the old blood being pushed out of the vessels *does* have somewhere to go--the empty atrium. It's the collecting bucket for old blood that is ready for another spin. In a setup like this, the vascular system isn't stressed by pressure spikes nearly as badly on every heart beat.\n\nAnd, I suppose I don't need to tell you as you've already pointed it out, but we have four chambers because we have a two-loop system. We effectively have two separate two-chamber hearts that are connected to each other in series and beat together in sync.",

It's called the atrial kick, and it improves the output of the heart greatly for very little effort.\n\nIf the ventricles just pumped out what was fed into them that would be fine, and in fact a great many people live without properly working atria as they age and their heart gets worn out and stops working properly.\n\nHowever, in a healthy heart we can improve our cardiac output by using the atria. To look up more information you want to look for Frank Starlings Law of the Heart. \n\nIn a nutshell, it means that the more you stretch muscle, the harder that muscle can contract. Think of it like a rubber band. If I stretch a rubber band a little bit I can shoot it a little bit of distance. If I stretch it a lot, I can shoot it way across the room.\n\nThe purpose of the atria is that as the ventricles get filled up, the atria contract and force extra blood into the ventricle. This stretches the wall of the ventricle and thanks to Starlings Law, the ventricle will then contract harder and eject more blood. The atrial kick is worked out to account for about 20-30% of your total cardiac output. You can live without it, but it is far more efficient to have it working as intended.",

This way you get all your lower-oxygen blood passing through the lung after returning to the heart rather than recirculating, and all your freshly-oxygenated blood headed out to the body where it is needed most. And you can pump blood at different pressures to the lungs and body, based on your needs.",

Trying to have those membranes on the same 'circuit' as the rest of the body would mean either having to run lower pressure everywhere else, or thickening those membranes leading to lower efficiency in the lungs. \n\nHaving 2 separate circuits allows for the best of both worlds.",

By having a chamber to pre load before pumping you ensure a rather even amount of blood flowing with each pump. Essentially it helps to regulate both the pressure within the heart as well as the pressure in the surrounding body.  \n\nThat being said, it\u2019s kind of a rough analogy. You can live without your tricuspid valve for some time (valve separating right atrium and ventricle), though typically damage to a valve throws off the pressures of the heart and quickly leads to heart damage. \n\nThis isn\u2019t a strictly required fact of evolution. While other mammals like cows, pigs, dolphins have four chambers, animals like lizards have 3.",

A large Ventricular Septal defect in babies can cause this issue where the ventricles get mixing of oxygenated blood from the pulmonary system and deoxygenated blood from the venous system. This is problematic both because you are pumping less than fully oxygenated blood to the rest of the body, and because you are putting pressures on the pulmonary system that it is not optimized for. Pediatric Cardiopulmonary development is really complex and its wild that it doesn't go wrong more often than it does.",

In some active lizards like monitor lizards the actual have a small build up of tissue to separate the heart into basically a 3.5 chamber heart. That helps them with the metabolic needs they have, being larger more active hunters. Crocodilians all have a 3.5 chamber heart like the monitor lizards and birds have 4 chambers which evolved from the 3.5 chamber they had from their ancestors.  Dinosaurs also probably had 4 chamber hearts. They discovered a fossilized heart and it showed 4 chambes as well",

The returning flow rate doesn't always exactly match the output flow rate at every instant in time, but the pump still needs to be always fully filled. Its even more important in a human circulatory system since vessels are very elastic and blood flow is very dynamic (total output and relative output to different organs can change quickly).\n\nAlso arterial flow is pulsatile and venous flow is continuous. Atria allow for a transition between the 2, as blood can continuously flow into them but then it leaves them in a pulsatile manner.",

It would take a heart at least twice the size to get pumping action without blood standing still. You'd need vein walls twice the size and .... well loads of other problems like bursting capillaries. Not to mention it would take time for blood to collect in the heart to be pumped through as it would stand still waiting to enter the heart. (Again, not a problem in smaller animals)\n\nNow blood flows continuously with relatively small pumping action.\n\nSame logic applies to blood coming from the lungs. It's all delicate tissue there and most pressure is lost in the capillaries. It flows out, but that's about it relatively speaking. It really needs a new push to make it through the body. \n\nIt's really economics. Oxygen is in demand everywhere all the time. So you need all blood oxygenated and de-carbondioxided all the time.

If an organism is going to have a high metabolism requiring high rates of aerobic respiration then they'll need a dedicated oxygenation circuit and a dedicated deoxygenation circuit and they can not mix at least during outflow from the heart as it would be suboptimal for a high metbolism animal to send oxygenated blood to the oxygenation circuit or to send deoxygenated blood to the deoxygenation circuit. In this scenario the heart needs at least 3 chambers. 1 chamber can be the recieving chamber from the two circuits but there then has to be a mechanism that seperated oxygenated blood from deoxygenated blood and eject those into the corresponding circuits. \n\nThe four chambered heart (aside from being a consequence of ancestral cardiovascular architecture) does a very good job of achieving what a high metabolism animal needs.

Think of your muscles as sort of like a rachet system combined with velcro.\n\nThe more hooks that connect between velcro the stronger the bond is, and like this, the more bonds between actin and myosin, the stronger the contractile force of the muscle is. It is a bit paradoxical at first to think about, but stretching the ventricular muscle allows more bonds between actin and myosin, creating a greater contractile strength.\n\nThis is important because the force of the ventricles has to overcome the blood pressure in the arteries. The term for what the atria do is called the atrial kick. Other things you can look up are the formula for cardiac output and the part of the formula for CO involving stroke volume.\n\nThe benefit of this system is that it balances out the systemic and pulmonary blood quite well. If suddenly you have an increase in blood to the atria, it will kick it to the ventricles with greater force, and then the ventricles will also do so, automatically.",

That allows Starling's Law to happen and increase contractility thus improving outflow from the ventricles.  We call it an atrial kick but the end result is more outflow from the heart.\n\nThey are the turbocharger of the cardiac system.",

I was trying to think up an analogy around running into the ropes on a wrestling ring but that's not right. \n\nSo imagine a car with a carburettor that continually provides a stream of air/fuel mixture feeding a single cylinder. The cylinder has to close the intake valve to stop backflow but that cuts down the window of intake and disrupts the flow from the carburettor. \n\nSo you add a second cylinder without a spark plug, it draws in the air-fuel mix from the carburettor and compresses it while feeding it into the real cylinder. This smooths out the flow from the carburettor and makes the real cylinder provide more power than it could on its own.",

The atrium is weak enough to be filled by this low pressure blood and has just enough force to push it quickly into the ventricle.\n\nThe ventricle can't really suck the blood in. The muscle can just relax and allow itself to be filled. Without the atrium, it would not fill as efficiently.",

But that\u2019s not really what you\u2019re asking.\n\nTo directly answer your question, having four distinct chambers allows for complete separation of deoxygenated blood coming into the heart going to the lungs, from the oxygenated blood returning from the lungs to the heart, to be pumped throughout the body.\n\nThis means that only fully oxygenated blood goes out to body. In amphibians and reptiles, which have three chambered hearts, you get mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the ventricle which is less efficient.",

            "comment": "Regarding your question whether we need atria. As said before atria are there mainly as storage location during ventricular contraction and their own contraction contributes only a small part to ventricular filling (about 10%, with the remainder flowing from the veins through the relaxed atria into the ventricle). This is also the reason that atrial fibrillation (where atrial cardiomyocytes don\u2019t contract in unison and the atria produce very little pressure) is not deadly (although it could lead to embolism formation and stroke, but that is besides the point) and ventricular fibrillation is.",

Four strokes are much more efficient and easy to deal with having the two extra strokes (chambers).  Besides if we were two strokes we'd have to put oil on our Cheerios!",

A two chamber pump is better than a 1 chamber pump.\n\nYour lungs expand and contact with breathing, so they operate around 1 atmospheric pressure.  Your body is big, and the pressure required to circulate blood to all of it is much greater than atmospheric pressure.  If your lungs had blood circulating at the pressure of the rest of your body, it wouldn't work out.  So your lungs get a loop of their own that operates at a lower pressure. So blood goes from your heart to your lungs and back at lower pressure, then is pumped out to your body at a higher pressure.\n\nSo you have 2 pumps, each using 2 chambers.",

It offers the advantage the atria can fill while the ventricles contract, then when the ventricles relax, the blood gets pumped into the ventricles.without atria, blood return to the header would have to stop every time the ventricles contract.  It is true that some people suffer from atrial fibrillation where the atria do not effectively pump. But at least flood can flow into them during ventricular contraction. But such people can experience symptoms of blood \u201cbacking up\u201d such as edema of legs and or pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs). And they need anticoagulants to prevent clots from forming in the atria.",

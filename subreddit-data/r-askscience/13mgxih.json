I had no idea that\u2019s what they were, I don\u2019t even understand what that means lol but I\u2019m really interested in looking deeper into it.\n\nThank you again.",

                    "comment": "Adding on...\n\n\"Fractals in nature\" is particularly hard to pin down.  Fractals in mathematics have a self-similarity over all scales.  Look at the Mandelbrot set.  The edge is fractal.  You can zoom in infinitely and get the same pattern.  But obviously you can't zoom into a tree infinitely and have it look the same - eventually you get down to cells then molecules, etc.  At best, you find that some parameter you can measure is similar over a range of scales of maybe 2 orders of magnitude.\n\nSo I don't think it's correct to describe any living organism as having any fractal quality.  There are some physical systems where you can get self-similarity over multiple orders of magnitude.  IIRC, it's possible to form particles of soot that have a constant fractal dimensionality over 3 or 4 orders.  (kind of a like activated carbon, but in the form of a very complex tumbleweed)",

            "comment": "first things first:\n\nthere is an infinite number of sequences, where the next element is the sum of the two prior elements. they all must start with two given start values. and in all of them the ratio between two consecutive elements tend to get near the golden ratio. the fibonacci sequence is the one, that starts with two ones. insofar, the fibonacci sequence is only \"special\" because it starts with the starting number of the natural numbers (depending on your definition of \"natural numbers\"). if you see a deeper meaning in just the fibonacci numbers, you are an occultist, not a mathematician.\n\nin mathematics, a fractal is some kind of function, where the result can vary quite strongly even it the input values only vary very little. you can call this behaviour \"chaotic\". usually in a function, if you round up the input values, you would expect the result to change very little. in some fractals, the visual representation of that function has some weired properties, like this \"self replication\". but because those visual representations are so popular, most people think, that self replication is the primary property of a fractal.\n\nso to your question:\n\nof course, you find the golden ratio in nature. \"all over\" is a strong term. if you find more than 5 examples, is this \"all over\"? if you are like me, you tend to \"overgeneralise\" things. if you find a number of things you would not expect, you tend to see theese things \"all over the place\" - even, if those things are quite sparse really and you have to actively look for those things. i noticed that behaviour in me some time ago and i now try to counteract it - but it is quite hard. we humans are born and bred for pattern recognition. but sometimes this ability turns into overdrive and we see patterns, where no patterns exist.\n\nso yeah - there are some plants, where some kind of self replicating pattern exists. does this plant know, what a fractal is? is the blueprint for this plant based on some mathematical function? or is it just a coincidence? i like good stories and i firmly want to believe into the first, but i strongly suspect, that the second is actually the case.\n\nusually, life on earth is \"self optimizing\". due to random mutations there are slight variations in the blueprint a species (its genetic code). if this mutation is detrimental, the individual with this mutation is killed of quite fast. if it is neutral, it may be implemented into the genetic pool of that species. or it also dies of by chance. but if it has some benefits, it is quite likely, that it will be soon dominating in that species - or branch of a new species.\n\nand in some cases, this \"self optimizing\" leads to a result, that resembles a visual representation of a fractal or something golden ratio related or something roughly cardioid shaped. cool fun facts for sure - but i would not put deeper thoughts in it.",

While I would say a good deal of any energy sector regulation is there because of safety, there is little political will with how nuclear is seen (in the US and maybe Japan) to streamline the permit process to build new reactors.\n\nBecause it is prohibitively expensive to get through the permit process, that is if they make it through, most interested in making money off energy can go other safer routes (safer as in sure ROI).  And because so few get approved and built (make it more expensive) the pay back time on a nuclear reactor is pretty long.\n\nAdd to the fact the there is a shortage of nuclear workers (Navy has a hard time keeping theirs) that probably adds to it as well.  There are also subsidies for other forms of energy and I am not sure if nuclear has the same.\n\nIn the end it comes down to economics, public perception/willpower, and politics.  Personally I would like the talk of the infrastructure plan to include many nuclear power plants as the ones in the US we have are old and continually upgraded, but new ones would probably be better.",

When the easy stuff is gone, the cost of oil becomes too expensive for most countries and it just keeps going up.  I remember the Peak Oil hypothesis was saying we'd hit the peak of amount of oil extracted per year in the late 2050s, so we have a little while to see how true this is.  BTW, they did take into account all known methods of oil extraction and all marked oil spots.  It's completely different from the aforementioned uranium mine capacity.",

Even Hubbard's original claim of a 1970's peak for the US has turned out wrong as US production returned to those levels in 2015. \n\nThe problem with the theory is that while it correctly predicted that extraction would become more difficult, it neglected to account for the fact that technology and scale would reduce cost. I remember reading that shale would only be profitable at $100+ barrel oil. Today there are shale operators doing just fine at current prices. \n\nOver a long enough time frame sure, we'll run out, it is finite, but there isn't a lot of evidence that is going to happen anytime soon. At current demand there are enough proven reserves to last until 2070. ",

Sand used to make concrete is very quickly getting used up, and one day we'll hit a point where all that good sand will be locked up in concrete, and eventually we will have to go pillage every small beach and go around testing every inch of dirt to locate secret stashes of that sand, or build huge energy-gobbling tumblers to properly weather sand into the kind we need for construction projects.",

It mostly comes from how the ore deposit (body?) was generated - by sedimentation, hydrothermal,  magmatic and more, it is bloody interesting science itself.\n\nSo you have ore deposit and you mine it. But there is always catch: only few percent or tens of percent of mine is rich and easy to extract ore. Then you have many percent of ore that is poorer in concentration and after that even more with low grade, but plentyful ore.\n\nThere is always economy that decides what miners will mine and what not.\n\nSo you have an uranium ore mine, with low grade stuff. If price for uranium cake is high or you are in urgent need for uranium 235 for... big fireworks either economy or army will provide iniciative to mine it.\n\nBut in peace times, when uranium is plentyful and easy to buy only easy to access mines are worked.\n\nSo you have 50 years worth of mines that are easy to explore. It will not be end of story after 50 years, just that miners will mine and metallurgist will process poorer ore.\n\nSame goes for every other metal. When gold price rocketed in last 20 years it was feasible and economic to mine gold (or better leach) old tailing dumps left by old time miners) because there was solid profit.\n\nThere are probably hundrets of thousands of mines that are abandoned not because they are empty , but because ore contained is too poor and to expensive to process to be competitive on free market.\n\nThe only metal I have info, that we do have danger of running out in midterm (less than 50years) is tin (Sn) , because deposits are few and not that big to begin with.\n",

The thing many people fail to realize is that one of the huge reasons that uranium-fuelled reactors got off the ground so quickly is that the front end infrastructure for generating uranium fuel was built to support nuclear weapon production, not energy production. To get to thorium reactors, a huge front end investment would have to be made just to allow for the construction of thorium plants, and that doesn't include all the work required to actually design, build, test, and perfect the thorium reactors. You would be looking at investing tens to hundreds of billions of dollars before you ever saw a dime of profit generated. With energy prices as low as they are, and the industry's inability to even build a pretty standard uranium reactor on time and on budget, there isn't anyone who would be willing to risk that much investment for such a relatively small payout. MAYBE if energy prices rise and that up front investment becomes more attractive, we will start to see serious investment in thorium reactor designs, but I wouldn't expect to see them in the near or even intermediate future.

There are breeder reactors out there that produce waste where plutonium can be harvested (and has, in the case of the USSR), but US Nuclear power production stands firmly on the back of Navy Nuclear power production for submarines. US nuclear weapons production was done in secret at the Hanford site as part of the Manhatten Project, and wasn't revealed until after the war. Nuclear power production in the Navy is largely attributed to Admiral Rickover, and his successful \"sales pitch\" to congress in the 40s and 50s. The navy popularized the PWR design, and that proof of work and operating experience is what paved teh way for US nuclear plants, which are NOT breeders (BWRs are 2nd most common, but they too are not breeders).\n\nAt this point the political hurdle is too high to jump, but authorizing breeder reactors and/or thorium reactors would solve the worlds energy needs for thousands maybe tens of thousands of years, and eliminate carbon emissions.  The dreamer in me hopes one day this will happen and the excess plutonium will be used for an Orion engines. One can dream.",

What is useful for generating power is the induced splitting of _lots_ of atoms at the same time, not the slow trickle of energy release you get from radioactive decay alone. To put it another way: nuclear reactors don't work because their fuel is radioactive, they work because their fuel is splittable by neutrons. Those are not the same thing (all fuel splittable by neutrons is radioactive, but not all radioactive atoms are splittable by neutrons). ",

Alphas have very short range in matter because they are massive and highly charged, so they primarily heat the plutonium itself. The decay heat is harvested and used to make electricity.\n\n238 is present in spent nuclear fuel but is difficult to produce in a normal reactor. It's normally made by neutron activation of Np237 or less commonly of Americium. Most of it was produced as part of nuclear weapons prduction at Savannah River, but they stopped and there was fear of a shortage for space applications. NASA currently has a joint project with the Department of Energy to develop ways to produce more.\n\nEdit: thanks for gold! To add, DoE/NASA is interested in ways to produce 238 that are both economical and proliferation resistant. It doesn't make sense to produce it like they used to because it's too expensive and only made sense as a byproduct of weapons production. The original process is also a proliferation concern, because the other product is Pu239 in a form that is the kind you need to make weapons.",

So the closer they are the more fission happens, the further they are the less fission happens.\n\nIn a molten salt, the fuel rods are in a salt. As fission happens the salt heats up and expands causing the rods to move away from each other, which in turn slows the fission reactions causing the salt to cool and allowing the salt to contract, which in turn moves the rods closer together, etc...\n\nThe idea is that there's a point where the salt can heat up too much and cause the rods to drift away to a point that no matter how cool the salt becomes, the rods won't get close enough to start back up. The idea would be for controllers of the reactor to keep the temp at just the right point so that they rods don't drift too far away. But say all the operators die for some reason, well then the reactor gets hotter and hotter to the point that the rods move past that critical threshold.  Fission stops and the reactor begins to cool.",

So a molten salt reactor can't explode. The worst thing you could do is intentionally increase the pressure and overfuel the reactor, and you could maybe melt the containment walls and kill everyone inside the reactor. But the people in the next building over would probably be ok as long as they got out of there pretty sharpish.\n\nThink of it like a phone Vs a computer.

Beta decay converts a neutron into a proton, and we have Protactinium-233 (Pa-233). Beta decay again to Uraium-233. Now, 90% of U-233 will fission. Of the 10% that don't, neutron capture to U-234. Neutron capture again to U-235. 85% of that will fission. Neutron capture again, U-236; and again U-237. Beta decay to Neptunium-237 (Np-237). Neutron capture to Np-238. Finally beta decay to Pu-238.\n\nIt all comes down to the fact that you are not committing energy into a system to create a wholly new particle, but instead using the strong force inherent to the atom to capture and retain stray neutrons, and then letting those neutrons decay to protons to form new elements.\n\nIn all, for 1000kg of thorium, you will get about 15kg of Pu-238. But 1000kg of Thorium will power a major American city for a year or more.\n\nPu-238 can be made in larger quantities in light-water reactors, but there are far more contaminants and undesirable by-products.",

It sounds good, fits a narrative and people repeat it, but the facts don\u2019t bear it out.\n\n1) you can\u2019t have a thorium cycle without obtaining enriched uranium or plutonium first.  Thorium isn\u2019t fissile, it needs to be bred by neutron capture into u-233.  Assuming you have a driver fuel to start the reaction off (u-233, u-235 or pu-239) then you can breed more u-233, but only slowly - Eg if you get 2.3-ish neutrons per fission, 1 is needed to induce another fission to continue the reaction, 1 is needed to breed th-232 to u-233 to maintain the original quantity of fuel, then you have 0.3 to cover losses and breeding new fuel.  Most goes to losses (it\u2019s actually very hard to get into breed most rather than a net burn) so you end up growing your original fuel only very slowly if at all.  Best way to create the original supply of driver fuel is then to dig up and enrich the only naturally occurring fissile isotope u-235.  For practical purposes you have to start with uranium first.  This can be either by enrichment t get it to a good enough quality to drive a thorium reactor or by using it in a uranium cycle and obtaining plutonium as a by product which can then be used as your driver fuel.  Either way you inevitably end up with the uranium enrichment or plutonium breeding technology to produce bombs.  There literally isn\u2019t a way of getting to a thorium cycle up and running without creating technology that could be used to create bomb grass material.\n\n2) there have been many attempts at thorium research reactors and it turns out its hard.  It\u2019s not like the technology has just been idly ignored.  Billions have been thrown at the problem from a variety of nations.  The most promising tech is usually considered liquid thorium salt (unfortunately highly corrosive), as it would allow a continual process of feeding in to a reactor fresh thorium and extracting the fission products (which poisons the reaction by absorbing neutrons - bad for breeding).  But even today the materials tech that can cope with a thorium liquid salt at commercial scale isn\u2019t there (ie providing commercial scale outputs for decades).  Comparatively uranium fuel cycles are readily achievable even with 1950\u2019s tech.  There are lots of research programmes but again demonstrably with 60 years of scientific and engineering advancements, not a single country has managed a viable thorium commercial reactor.",

Two easy ways to consider this are cars and houses; cars have become safer and more comfortable over time and houses have become larger (much, the average new construction in the US is about three times larger now then it was when we first started measuring this 63 years ago) with far more amenities and labor savers then in the past. Prices don't account for this because people buy more house/car instead of realizing the decline in price.\n* We measure the changing price of goods based on what people buy from where not a constant basket which means non-quality factors drive up price levels. People buying expensive rice from Whole Foods instead of their local supermarket will drive up the price level of rice even though there are cheaper options available, price levels seek to understand what people are paying for goods not what the price floor is for goods.\n* Due to how we measure price levels (urban only, within census region which usually eliminates stores like Walmart and Ikea that people travel to and completely excluding most online retailers) and how we actually compute CPI (consumption diaries are wildly inaccurate) CPI-U actually represents the price level experiences of a high-income family living in a city not an average American. BLS &amp; CB are working on fixing these issues but it takes them a very long time (decades) to research and implement new measures.\n\nCPI is useful for understanding price changes short term (the errors it introduces are small enough that looking at quarterly price changes wont diverge much from the real price level change) but longer time series often uses [GDP deflator](https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2016/article/comparing-the-cpi-with-the-gdp-price-index-and-gdp-implicit-price-deflator.htm) as its more accurate over longer periods (but with the problem it can't examine specific goods, only aggregate prices).\n\nIn reality you would have a fairly difficult time showing that quality of life has fallen for anyone (with the exception of white low-income males), the economic doom &amp; gloom plays well in the media but isn't supported well by the data.",

The world's first reactors (early 1940s Hanford site) were for weapons, the energy sector hijacked the technology for commercial use. Uranium power was the low hanging fruit, since the research was already there. Power companies just decided to not re-invent the wheel with thorium when the tax-payers had already invented functional uranium reactors. ",

It has to be chemically removed from the fuel rods because it and other fission products screw with the proper operation of the reactor. Trace amounts of Plutonium CAN occur in nature in uranium deposits where the natural decay of a U-238 will turn another into an atom of Pu-239, but we're talking about literally maybe a couple dozen parts per billion. Pu-239 has a half life of around 24,000 years (and Pu-238 has a half life of around 90 years), compared to billions of years for U-238, and close to a million years for U-235, and as such, any Plutonium that was present when earth coalesced has long since decayed.",

If you end up with other isotopes contaminating your plutonium, these other isotopes will emit the wrong type of radiation. The correct isotope, Pu^238, emits a lot of alpha radiation which causes it to heat up, but does not require much shielding. Other isotopes will damage your spacecraft with beta or gamma radiation instead of generating useful power. \n\n2. To generate it, you basically hit Np^237 with a neutron to make Np^238 and wait for a decay. However, Np^238 is fissile, and for that matter so is Pu^238 and Np^237. So you have to hit your source material with a neutron once but not twice. You basically shove it into a nuclear reactor (which has a lot of neutrons flying around) and then pull it back out. \n\n3. And then there\u2019s the waste. You basically end up with a bunch of hot radioactive waste which you have to separate into its different parts, because the plutonium part of it is useful. But it\u2019s all mixed together so you end up dissolving it in acid and doing a bunch of chemical reactions to get your plutonium out. It\u2019s hard to do this safely and you have to figure out what to do with all the waste you just made.",

What happens with these, basically, is that you have a chunk of plutonium (although due to shortages of the necessary isotope of plutonium the European Space Agency is looking into making RTGs with Americium, if memory serves) which, as it undergoes radioactive decay, generates heat.  You stick a few heat fins onto the chunk of plutonium to create a heat gradient, and then place thermocouples across that gradient to generate electricity via the Seebeck effect.\n\nIf you want more information, the wiki article on RTGs is pretty good.\n\nADDENDUM: To loop it back to the original question, the reason you can't use most nuclear waste for useful generation of energy is precisely BECAUSE of the fact that it'll be radioactive for thousands of years.\n\nTo use a very simplistic example, take an atom of U232 and U233; the first has a half-life of 70 years, the second a half-life of around 15000 years.  The total energy each atom contains (in terms of atomic binding energy) isn't appreciably different.  Yet because the atom of U232 emits half of that energy (an inaccurate description, yes, but close enough) over a mere 70 years, its energy OUTPUT per unit time (the wattage it emits) is much greater, so you can actually use it to power things on the timescales we work on.",

But only a few isotopes are active enough to be efficient. \n\nIt's somewhat similar to generating power from flowing water. You could put turbines in storm drains and small creeks and generate power but the amount would be so small that it wouldn't be worth it. The cost and impact would be too high. So you only usually see dams at points rivers where you can generate a huge amount of power. \n\nWith most nuclear waste it's the same thing. Sure there is the potential for power, but it's not a lot. Certainly not enough to justify the cost of building the generator and making sure no one is harmed by the dangerous fuel. Why build an expensive and dangerous generator when there are dozens of safer and cheaper means that can easily produce more power? \n\nThings like space exploration are different though. There are only a handful of ways to generate power in space and safety isn't much of a concern. The big concern there is weight though so instead of waste, which is pretty heavy for the amount of radiation produced, things like Plutonium have been used.  ",

Reactors are basically neutron machines and anything you can do without one (e.g., using a particle accelerator) is going to be very inefficient by comparison.",

The energy of the neutron is the most important factor, as only certain isotopes can be split by the neutrons produced in different fissions. For example, the neutrons resulting from U-238 fission are not energetic enough to start other U-238 fissions, but those released in U-235 fissions can cause a U-235 fission chain reaction. In addition, almost all reactors are already fueled by long, thin fuel rods, traditionally composed of uranium oxide, though other fuel compositions such as those used in TRIGA or CANDU reactors. \n\nThe neutrons released by fission are released in any given direction with an equal probability, hence why most reactor designs are circular/square in shape. It is simply far more energy efficient to have a round design than a long tube, this also increases the chance that there will be a neutron interaction that leads to fission. \n\nSome neutron generators exist, such as Californium-252 and other elements mixed with beryllium, but these have far shorter half-lives than uranium and are typically the waste products of reactors. These can be used to start the reactors from a cold start. ",

The issue is the neutron counts would be so low that you'd never know the reactor was critical, and by the time you see it, power can be rising so quickly that it's unsafe or uncontrollable. Sources raise the source range counts so that less effective multiplication is required to monitor the reactor. It gives us something readable that we can measure and control, and see when the reactor goes critical right away.",

Radioactive waste is not even necessarily fuel based waste or byproduct. \n\nA large amount of radioactive waste comes from the analysis and preprocessing of samples, research materials, and energy and weapons grade materials. \n\nSuffice it to say, I can\u2019t use contaminated gloves, pipettes rags, containers, glassware, instruments, paper towels, water, solvents and raw materials that have handled specific kinds of radiation over and over without cross contamination becoming a major hinder acne to science. Yes there are a lot of circumstances where a thing could be reused and consumed over and over, but there are precautions in place to prevent using things like broken gloves or highly contaminated objects over and over. These become mixed material radioactive waste. This and chemicals that are used for analysis and processing of fuels and other tranUranic elements  are considered radioactive waste. They are all stored in those radioactive warning drums at places like WIPP. \n\nSo the main reason besides the degraded energy output of radionuclide daughter species that the top level commenter mentioned, is that a lot of radioactive waste is waste due to materials and chemicals contaminated in radioactivity and radioactive compounds that are essentially ingrained in the material and would cost more to isolate and recover and aggregate and transform and refine, than it would cost to store in a bunker.",

Being inside a reactor causes the metal to become brittle, and the life of the fuel rod is determined by the life of that casing. \n\nIn other reactor designs, like molten salt reactors, this casing is not used. The fuel stays in the reactor for much longer and much more of the potential energy is extracted. This results in lower volumes of waste that is much less radioactive for much less time than that coming from traditional reactors. \n\nLearn more about molten salt reactors [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molten_salt_reactor).

If too many neutrons are absorbed, the fuel can't sustain a fission chain reaction (subcritical) and is useless. This is called \"poisoning\" of the fuel, and requires reprocessing (removing the fission products) to fix. Molten salt reactors would do constant reprocessing of the fuel at an on-site reprocessing plant. In theory current nuclear plants could use on-site reprocessing, but it would be harder since they would need to take apart the fuel rods in order to reach the fuel and the re-fabricate them. \n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_poison#Accumulating_fission_product_poisons",

This is why they are so useful in reactors.  The neutron damage that occurs in other materials doesn't happen in molten salts.  This is why the fuel can be left in the reactor until it is largely consumed.

                    "comment": "You're sorta right. Xenon is a problem is reactor design but it's not because of the fuel rods shattering. Xenon is a fission product of U235, and for the most part because it is a gas it can escape the fuel pellets. But the reason that it is a problem is because all of nuclear reactors depend on neutrons to run. Every material has a neutron absorbsion cross section (meaning  how likely it is for an incident neutron  to be  absorbed), to run a fuel needs to have a higher absorbsion cross section that the surroundings otherwise it won't get neutrons and it won't fission. Xenon has a significantly larger cross section that U235 so it essentially \"poisons\" the reactor. To combat this the operators either wait for it to decay out or give positive reactivity into the system to balance out the poison. \n\nAdditionally fuel rods are actually UO2 pellets that are put into a tube of zirconium alloy. And they usually don't break but they can end up bending or swelling in operation due to thermal or nuclear expansion. Usually the lifetime of a rod is due to economics of balancing out sumarium poison and reactivity left in the rod and efficiently, cost, what the reactors rated for, ect ect ect",

Think of using tides to generate electricity; the entirety of the vast oceans rises and falls all the time and using the tide to float a big weight up and let it drop during low tide to produce electricity sounds simple. In fact it is simple, but a system that is rugged enough to last on the coast/in the ocean and massive enough to produce meaningful amounts of electricity is not cost effective. Similarly trying to collect small amounts of gamma, beta, and alpha radiation just isn't going to be worth the effort with current tech.\n\nThis isn't a fair comparison, tidal generation is limited by the physics of lifting something less dense than water the the height delta of the tide and you can quickly figure out just how much energy you can get and how much the contraption is going to weight and see that wind/solar is the better option. If some creative approach comes up to convert beta and alpha particles directly to electricity on a large scale with suitable efficiency, then we may see waste barrels being rolled out to make power again.\n\nWaste can be reprocessed to refine out the non-waste components for further use in standard reactor designs. For anti-proliferation treaty reasons, the US doesn't do this, but France does and they reprocess fuel for most of the world (this is actually a service offered to Iran and North Korea as incentive to not do it themselves to reduce proliferation).",

These can be extracted by \"reprocessing\".  Additionally, many fission fragments have economic value as radioisotopes and could be extracted with reprocessing as well.  The volume of nuclear waste that actually needed to be \"disposed\" could be radically reduced.\n\nOnly the fissile uranium and plutonium can be \"used\" to generate energy but it needs to be fairly pure.  Hence if left in waste, it isn't pure enough.\n\nOpposition to reprocessing is a major **political** point of the anti-nuclear movement - anti-nuclear proponents don't want to reduce the volume of nuclear waste because it would make using nuclear power more attractive. \n\nIt is also a major **political** point of anti-proliferation - though that has not been nearly as effective as a deterrent (Pakistan got it fissile material from China and China was intimately involved in the Pakistani nuclear weapons program). \n\nAs it is, there are two nations to do reprocess nuclear waste: France and Japan.  So currently reprocessing goes on despite anti-nuclear/anti-proliferation opposition and the logistic supply chains are in many ways far more dangerous than if major nuclear nations simply had their own reprocessing and breeder programs.\n\nMuch of the opposition to nuclear power is emotional rather than objectively rational.  An additional \"real\" problem is that reactor designs are stuck in the 1950s and have not innovated like many other things like, say, transistors.  Safer reactors could easily be designed (and have been designed) but emotional opposition prevents new designs from being adopted **in the United States and Western countries**.\n\nThis is why most nuclear reactor and ecosystems are primarily being innovated in both India and China rather than in the West.  Perhaps once these nations have created new reactors and reprocessing systems they will *allow* Western countries to buy *their technology*.",

            "comment": "There's a pretty good documentary on Amazon Prime called Uranium, it's a PBS production. Really helped me understand it better. It's because U235 is the only usable element due to its unique number of protons and neutrons which causes it to split more easily when disturbed. As it decays, it becomes different elements, eventually becoming lead. That takes more years than any of us will live to occur.",

            "comment": "It could be with processing and using different Reactors. Current reactors mostly are PWR(Pressurised water reactor). they aren't very good at getting all the energy out, in fact like only 5% the est remains behind as waste.\n\nWith different reactor type like integral fast reactor the waste can on-site be processed with new material and used again. In this cycle you ill use up to 90% of the fuel (eg 5G% vs 90%). It's a huge difference. Such a test reactor was actually running for 2 decades in US but to scale and commercialize serious investments would be need and sadly they are mostly going into inefficient renewables.\n\nNote that the much better use of material leaves behind a lot less waste. That waste is also radioactive for much, much shorter time, like 300 years. But of course it's much more radioactive in that time (much shorter half-life).\n\nStill IFR could solve a lot of clean energy problems, the reactor could burn the waste from current reactors (after processing) and the reactor could also be made to work with thorium which is much more abundant than uranium. This would give us power for the next 100K years easily.",

            "comment": "It's tougher to manage the heat production in older fuel rods. The process of burning the fuel produces waste products that poison the fuel. The effect is to cause the heat output to oscillate between not much heat to too much at a given power setting.\n\nYou can however take old fuel and run it through a purification process to filter out the waste elements and you'll have good as new fuel rods.  \n\nProblem is the anti-nuke crowd have put up so many obstacles it's not worth doing. So the waste just goes to waste.",

            "comment": "there are several types of \"nuclear waste\", but you've meant \"depleted nuclear fuel\" probably.\n\nIt it was a uranium-235 thermal neutrons reactor, it consists of\n\n1) unused \"fuel\" (e.g. uranium-235) which can be reused for new fuel,\n\n2) leftover uranium-238, which can be reused for production of Pu-239,\n\n3) plutonium-239 which can be used for new fuel or glorious nuclear weapons,\n\n4) other products of U-235 fission, some of which are higly radioactive, making the depleted fuel higly radioactive and hard to handle, most of them unsuitable for forced(induced) fission, and thus mostly useless.\n\n5) products of non-fuel materials catching neutrons, most of which are also radioactive and useless.\n\nSo yea, #4 and #5 are mostly useless - they are radioactive enough to be dangerous (and for many-many years), but are not really heating much (well, after several years anyway).\n\nAnd if there is a useful element in there, it is hard to separate it from the other ones, because, again, the compound is higly radioactive.",

            "comment": "Simply put, most reactors today use so called slow, or thermic neutrons to split the nuclei, but those can't split the nuclei of the waste. If you use fast moving neutrons, they also split the waste. The problem is, that a reactor with fast moving neutrons, is very different to the \"standard\" reactors, that are currently used. They use water for cooling, but water in the reactor will slow down the neutrons. Tested designs with fast neutrons used Sodium for cooling, but they had problems with attrition because of that, and were generally very expensive. The Experimental Breeder Reactor II was one of those.\n\nTo use new Uranium is simply cheaper, so it is not commonly used.\nThese fast-neutron reactors would be good to get rid of the waste, though, if it can be made affordable.\n\nEdit: spelling",

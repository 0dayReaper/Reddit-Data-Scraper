Any effect from that would be far outweighed by the heating which would depend on the construction of the arrow.  You'd have the air around it heating up, parts of the arrow explosively vaporizing, the fletching could vaporize, possibly off center redirecting the arrow, the shaft could deform or just shatter.   The whole thing could just go \"Poof\" and you'd have a few pieces of debris fluttering down.",

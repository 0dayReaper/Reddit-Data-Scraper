    "postText": "Somebody posted this question [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/lkij7f/how_many_neurons_do_earthworms_have/), but the only answer given linked to an article about a nematode (C. elegans) and then said \"the bodies have a few more nerves because it\u2019s longer but the nervous system will be relatively the same\". But C. elegans and earthworms aren't even in the same phylum, so I'm skeptical of the assumption that earthworms will have similar numbers of neurons. Does anybody know of any numbers which have been found for earthworms specifically? Or for any annelid species?",

Here's a paper that looked at GABAergic neurons but also did a full count of neurons in the earthworm CNS. They found about 5000 neurons ([https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004410050663](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004410050663)).\n\nYou're absolutely correct that C elegans and earthworms have completely different nervous systems!",

They're not even in the same phylum and they differ in mass by a factor of &gt;100,000.\n\nThe closest relative to earthworms in that table seems to be the leech, with 10,000 neurons.",

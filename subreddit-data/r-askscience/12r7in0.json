There has also been some genetic evidence that support a same sex preference, however this appears to be elusive.  A more permissive environment and supportive family seem to be equally important however.\n\nA change in sexual preference back and forth over time has often been noticed among people identifying as bisexual; sometimes referred to as their 'bi-cycle'.  In the [Klein Sexual Orientation Grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klein_Sexual_Orientation_Grid) sexual attraction is a self-identified element in the past, present, and ideal, recognising that sexual preference may change over time.",

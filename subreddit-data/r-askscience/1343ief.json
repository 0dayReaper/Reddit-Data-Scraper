    "postText": "Let's say I have a 2 meter rod next to me, stationary wrt. me, at time t0. Now, let's say it starts moving and by the time it's 1 km away from me (t1), it's going 0.865c, which means it should look just 1 meter long to me. Does that mean that from my perspective, the back of the rod has traveled 1 meter further than the front? I.e. 999.5 meters for the front, and 1000.5 meters for the back?\n\nTo be more precise, the middle of the rod is touching my shoulder at t0, and the middle of the rod is exactly 1km away from that point at t1.\n\nWhat now if the rod is 2km instead of 2m? Will the back of the rod seem to travel 1500 meters, and the front only 500 meters?\n\nAnd, what if there are 3 2m rods, one 1km behind me, one 1km in front of me, and one next to me. They accelerate in unison. Do they individually become shorter, but stay 1km apart, or does the length between them also contract?",

            "comment": "Welcome to the annoyance of acceleration in special relativity!\n\nI don't have time to write out a full answer at the moment, but I'll give a brief summary.\n\nWhen you start treating acceleration, you need to keep in mind that an accelerating frame isn't inertial, meaning you cannot apply Lorentz transformations directly between the frames. That's not to say you can't treat acceleration with special relativity - it just becomes a lot more annoying.\n\nNow, your question is fundamentally about what happens to a non-pointlike object when discussing chronology/time ordering, so lot me ask you this: Your rods are accelerating at the same rate *with respect to whom?* Say your two meter rod starts accelerating away from you: Now, which part starts accelerating first? The two ends of the rod are not local to each other; if they both start accelerating at the same time in *your* frame, that means that the *front* of the rod started accelerating *before the back* in their frames.\n\nA simpler version of your problem (without the acceleration) is called the pole barn paradox, and is often used to illustrate the importance of locality!",

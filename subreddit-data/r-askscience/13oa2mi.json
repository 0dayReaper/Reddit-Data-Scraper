    "postText": "I'm asking this question because I'm a bit stumped. I was reading up on iron's role in star death which got me curious about the energy release of fusion &amp; fission reactions throughout the periodic table. It seems intuitive to me that a nuclear energy output equation would look something like this:  \n\\*energy output = (Mass of extra products converted to MeV) - (nuclear binding energy)\\*  \nSo for example, if a reaction produces an extra 2 neutrons, would your energy output be the mass of the 2 neutrons minus the binding energy required to get them to split?  \nIs the above correct or do I have a missing piece(s) somewhere?",

            "comment": "The amount of energy released in a nuclear reaction or decay is called the Q-value. And the Q-value for an arbitrary reaction/decay is equal to\n\nQ = (\u03a3*_f_* m*_f_* - \u03a3*_i_* m*_i_*)c^(2)\n\nwhere m*_f_* are the masses of the particles in the final state, and m*_i_* are the masses of the particles in the initial state.\n\nOr in terms of binding energies,\n\nQ = \u03a3*_i_* B*_i_* - \u03a3*_f_* B*_f_*.\n\nThere's an online calculator [here](https://www.nndc.bnl.gov/qcalc/).",

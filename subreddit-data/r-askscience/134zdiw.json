The whole reason we use it in PCR is because it is still functional at higher temps. Any other unwanted enzymes, like DNAses (which would ruin the whole assay) are destroyed by the heat. \n\nOn the whole, very few endogenous enzymes can withstand 60C.",

            "comment": "High fever can be dangerous because it can lead to denaturation of proteins in the body. Proteins are held together by weak bonds, and high temperatures can cause these bonds to break, leading to changes in the protein's structure and function. This can alter normal cell metabolism, leading to cell injury and death, and can also trigger apoptosis. Since most enzymes are proteins, they can also get denatured at high temperatures and lose their activity, which can slow down body metabolism.",

            "comment": "Something thats misunderstood is if you go donate a pint of blood at the Red Cross, you are donating what is called \"Whole Blood\". You are right that Whole Blood contains both red blood cells and plasma. **Because of this, there is no universal donor for Whole Blood.** For most transfusions we do not transfuse Whole Blood. Usually, your Whole Blood donation is separated and processed into two other products: Packed Red Blood Cells and some form of Plasma (Fresh Frozen, PF24, Liquid). For reasons stated above, the universal donor for pRBCs is O Neg. And the universal donor for Plasma is AB (Rh-type doesn't matter).\n\nNormally in emergencies where we don't know the patients blood type. We transfuse all the parts of Whole Blood separately. We give group O pRBCs, AB plasma, and Platelets (where type generally doesn't matter)\n\nIn extreme emergencies, where patients have massive hemorrhage, some places may carry and transfuse Whole Blood regardless of blood type. This product is usually called Low Titer O Whole Blood. We use O Blood so the RBCs are guaranteed to be compatible, but O Whole Blood has antibodies in the plasma that can be dangerous (Anti-A, Anti-B, and even a third one somewhat confusingly called Anti-A,B). So what we do is \"titer\" the donors to see how strong these antibodies are, and select only weaker \"low titer\" donors. This minimizes the risk of possible transfusion reaction. Most places that do use Low Titer O will only give 2 or 4 units of it before switching to individual components.",

Since a very large amount of fluids, drugs, and RBCs are administered JUST to keep the patient alive, their clotting factors and platelets are 'diluted' to such a degree that their blood won't clot so well anymore. This is why we try to give clotting factors(plasma) and platelets along with RBCs to counteract the dilutional effect.",

While platelets are an important part of the clotting process, replacing platelets doesn't cause clots.\n\nOne useful way to think about this is to think of a clot as building a wall.  To build that wall, you need bricks, mortar, and a foundation.  In this comparison, platelets are the bricks, clotting factors are the mortar, and the blood vessel wall is the foundation.  If you are missing platelets or clotting factors, it is important to replenish them by adding platelets or plasma, respectively.  And it is important to repair tissue defects (suturing lacerations, etc.) so that they have a place to stick.",

Because it's not the only anticoagulation step, it's not immediate death or something, just increased clotting chances based on local concentration of that protein versus others.",

Factor V is part of the group of proteins that causes clots to form. In factor V Leiden, there is a mutation that makes the protein harder for the anticoagulant proteins to turn it off, so you end up with an imbalance that makes it more likely for you to make clots when and where you don't want them.",

Human immune cells create a huge number and variety of different antibodies by randomly mixing different DNA sections. The resulting antibody is checked against existing cell antigens; if it reacts it is disposed of to prevent autoimmune disease and if no reaction then it is allowed to circulate. If a particular antibody design is seen as reacting to a new antigen at a higher rate then it is assumed to be defending against some new foreign invader and that design is ramped up as part of the immune defense. As far as blood types go, if you don't have either A or B antigens on your RBCs, then you are likely to have a small amount of existing circulating antibodies that would bind those antigens just by random chance.",

There are very similar ABO-like antigens that exist in nature (probably your food and gut bacteria) that you are exposed to, and ABO antibodies routinely develop around 4 months old. We call them naturally-occurring to differentiate them from other less well-known blood groups that require direct exposure to someone else's blood to develop.\n\n&gt; As far as blood types go, if you don't have either A or B antigens on your RBCs, then you are likely to have a small amount of existing circulating antibodies that would bind those antigens just by random chance.\n\nSmall amount and random chance being used here is really misleading. ABO antibodies are very specific antibodies tending to be relatively high titer, high affinity, and high avidity antibodies that regularly cause catastrophic and even fatal transfusion reactions when incompatible blood is transfused. ABO antibodies are no more unintentional than any other output of your immune system.",

            "comment": "When a person donates blood, usually they drain a whole pint into a bag and send you off. Later, that bag of blood is separated into different components. The two in question are plasma and red blood cells. People aren't usually given whole blood during a transfusion. They are usually given one of the components. \n\nThat answers the main question, here's more info on blood types if curious:\n\nYour red blood cells have little flags on them that the body uses to identify (among other things). The most significant of those flags are 'ABO' and 'Rhesus factor'.\n\n'ABO' refers to what combination of 'A' and 'B' flags you have on your blood cell. You have two spaces in your genes to create your 'ABO' blood type, and 'O' refers to a lack of those flags altogether. 'A' and 'B' are dominant, so if you express either then that's what you have. If you have AA, then your blood type is 'A'. If you have 'BB' then your blood type is 'B'. If you have AB, then your blood type is 'AB'. If you are AO, then you are 'A'. If your blood type is OO, then you are 'O'.\n\nRhesus factor is easier: positive if you have it, and negative if you don't.\n\nSo if you were to put blood types on a spectrum, 'O negative' blood cells have no flags on them at all, and 'AB positive' has all of the flags on them. Everything else falls in between them.\n\nWhatever your blood type is, the plasma contains flags (called antibodies) to the opposite. The antibodies in plasma will bind to whatever accepts it, and destroys it. So if you are O negative, then your plasma contains antibodies to everything else (A, B, and AB and Rhesus positive). Therefore, if you receive blood cells from anyone other than O negative, the antibodies in your blood will activate and destroy them. AB positive blood on the other hand has blank plasma with no flags, so their plasma can be given to anyone.",

            "comment": "AB and Rho are different molecules that sit on top of your cells. Someone who is O negative does not make any of these antigens on their cells. So their cells will not trigger an A B or Rh reaction when transfused into someone else.\n\nOn the other hand, someone who is A B positive has plasma that is tolerant to A and B and Rho. So when it is transfused into someone who expresses A, B, Rho, or nothing, it will not react.",

            "comment": "Blood donations are separated into packed red cells and plasma components after donating, unless you're in some special whole blood product trial or you're doing a pheresis donation. \n\n\nA and B are different molecules that reside on your red blood cells. If you're group A, you have A antigens. Same with group B and B antigens. Group O has neither of them, and group AB has both of them.\n\n\n\nIn your blood plasma, you'll have antibodies against the opposing blood types antigens. If your group A, you'll have anti-B. If you're group B, you have anti-A. Group O has anti A&amp;B. Group AB has neither. \n\n\nRh status (Positive or negative blood types) is a different system. You either have the Rh antigen or you don't, which makes you positive or negative. People who are Rh negative  don't naturally produce anti-Rh unless they get exposed to Rh antigen through a blood transfusion or a fetal maternal bleed. My facility doesn't look at Rh pos/neg when transfusion plasma, because all products are screened for antibodies while being manufactured, so are considered safe for both Rh pos and neg patients.\n\nSo. We consider O negative blood cells the universal donor because that type is compatible with all other types. A, B, AB, and other O, all positive or negative can receive it safely. AB plasma, on the other hand, has no antiA or antiB and can safely be transfused to anyone. **That being said,** most people will generally receive a type specific or type compatible transfusion or red cells or plasma because of inventory concerns. AB blood type is uncommon, so we tend to reserve that plasma specifically for AB patients. 40% of the population is O pos, and another 40% are A Pos, so we're not going to waste O Negative red cells on them. They'll receive O Pos and A pos cells respectively.\n\n\nThere are exceptions. In trauma situations, my facility give O pos cells and A plasma to male traumas, and O neg cells with A plasma to female traumas of child bearing age. The assumption is that if a patient is bleeding out, the risk of transfusion reactions is lower than them just dying of blood loss. We give females O Neg to hopefully prevent future issues of developing anti Rh and potentially cause HDFN for a future pregnancy.\n\nThere are also areas that are wanting to move to whole blood products for trauma situations.",

            "comment": "The blood and plasma work like a pair of puzzle pieces. You can think of the blood side as the part that sticks out and the plasma as the slot it needs to fit into. \"A\" blood means there is an \"A\" part sticking out on the blood side that needs an \"A\" slot to fit into, same for \"B\". \"AB\" means the blood has both an \"A\" and \"B\" thing sticking out, so it needs both and \"A\" and \"B\" slot in the plasma. \"O\" has no sticking out bits so \"O\" blood will fit into plasma that has either \"A\", \"B\", both, or no slots. \"O\" plasma has no slots so \"A\", \"B\", or \"AB\" won't fit into it.\n\n\nIf you get \"AB\" plasma, it will have enough slots for your blood no matter what.",

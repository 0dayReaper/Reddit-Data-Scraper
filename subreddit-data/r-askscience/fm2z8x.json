            "comment": "Cardiovascular physiologist with extensive exercise physiology experience here.\n\nCouple of things first - cardiac muscle is fundamentally different compared to skeletal muscle. Although certain contractile proteins are similar, in terms of energetics (energy production and consumption), cardiomyocytes (heart cells) are very different. \n\nThe main reason why cardiomyocytes are so resistant to fatigue is because they contain almost twice the amount of mitochondria. Mitochondria are the **aerobic** cellular powerhouse. We know this by looking at the content of [citric synthase which tracks very well with mitochondrial content.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4121645/#!po=35.0000)\n\nThe heart is very metabolically flexible in terms of fuel. [It consumes glucose, free fatty acid and **lactate.** Yes.. you read that right. It consumes lactate (so does skeletal muscle).](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290415/) This is especially pronounced at high exercise intensities.\n\nFinally, cardiomyocytes are very well vascularized and since they have more mitochondria are incredibly good at extracting oxygen and using it for aerobic respiration. In fact, even at the rest heart muscle pretty much extracts most usable oxygen from blood which means the only way for the heart to improve oxygen delivery is to improve flow (as it cannot improve on extraction).\n\nThese are just some broad concepts but I recommend taking a look at some exercise physiology texts that will help.\n\nObligatory edit - Woah! this blew up. RIP my inbox. \n\nThanks for the kind words. Going to try to answer the most common questions asked here.\n\n**One common question is - what would happen if we replaced all muscle in the body with cardiac muscle?**\n\n**Answer** \n\nLots of bad things. Cardiac cells talk to each other through a structure called the intercalated disk which allows all cardiomyocytes to beat synchronously to produce an effective beat. Further, cardiomyocytes are self-excitatory i.e. they contract even without nerve supply (that's why a transplanted heart with its nerves cut still beats - a lot faster rate too because the heart needs the vagus nerve to rein it in). Obviously both of these would be very bad for skeletal muscle as these are incompatible with voluntary, purposeful movements. First, it's precisely because muscle fibers in a motor unit are isolated from others that we're capable of effective movements otherwise a contraction that started in one fiber would rapidly spread to others. Secondly, you can only imagine how bad it would be if skeletal muscle cells started to contract by themselves without any nervous system input. Ninja edit - oh and one more thing, the [metabolic rate of cardiac tissue per unit mass is almost 35-times greater](https://nyaspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2000.tb06470.x?sid=nlm%3Apubmed) than skeletal muscle (440 kcal/kg per day vs 13 kcal/kg per day). If we replaced skeletal muscle with cardiac muscle our daily energetic needs would skyrocket given that skeletal muscle is a substantial percentage of our body mass/weight.\n\n**Another common question - some variation of; does the heart only have a set number of beats and if I speed my heart up with exercise am I draining it?**\n\n**Answer**\n\nNot true and please don't stop exercising. If anything, exercise revs up your heart (esp cardio; weight training has very modest cardiac effects) during exercise and that's a good thing (if your heart rate doesn't go up that's bad and called chronotropic incompetence). That's because over time you get what's called eccentric hypertrophy so your heart can pump more blood out per beat (increased stroke volume). Further, regular cardio also increases vagal tone (the vagus is the nerve that slows the heart rate) and this in combination with the increased stroke volume means you get a very nice resting heart rate. [Low resting heart rates](https://heart.bmj.com/content/99/12/882) and [high cardiorespiratory fitness] (https://mayocl.in/2WzpBok) VO2max (or VO2peak) are associated with significantly lower risks of heart disease and all-cause mortality.",

In fact, there's excellent evidence to suggest that the preferred pathway to burn glucose is through the lactate rather than the pyruvate pathway.

There is no way for a cell to produce lactate without producing pyruvate first. If a cell takes up exogenous lactate as a fuel source it will first convert it back into pyruvate before it can be further metabolized in the mitochondria.",

The formation of lactate actually requires the absorption of some of those excess hydrogen ions, which helps reduce that burn.\n\nBasically, your body doesnt have enough oxygen to clear the excess hydrogen that has accumulated and this is part of what leads to *the burn*.",

If you want to read up on any of this you wouldn't need a research article as this information can be found in any high school biology textbook. If you want some particular examples, you can look at how parietal cells use proton pumps to pump H+ ions into the gastric lumen to reduce pH to help digest food.\n\nOr perhaps the most famous example, you can google the respiratory chain/electron transport chain in the mitochondria (also called oxidative phosphorylation with chemiosmosis), where energy derived from redox reactions (which as a chemist I assume you are familiar with), are used to pump protons across the mitochondrial membrane, and creating a huge electrochemical gradient that is consequently used to transform potential energy into kinetic energy into chemical energy in the forms of ATP.\n\nOf course also, hydrogen ions are released from both inorganic and organic acids in the body (as the case with lactate and ketoacids), just as they are in a regular chemical solution.",

All cells, neurons and various excitable cells especially use sodium/potassium gradients across their outer membrane maintained through active pumps to provide a potential energy source for various solute transport where in exchange for relaxing the gradient other solutes can be transported against concentration gradients. In terms of protons, these are commonly used across the inner mitochondrial membrane, when we aerobically respire glucose, we basically combust it in very small steps to release the energy slowly, this is used to reduce NAD+ and FAD which act as electron carriers, a further series of redox reactions in proteins studded in the mitochondrial membrane then use this to pump across protons to lead to a large electrochemical gradient of protons. This can then be used to force ADP and phosphates together to form ATP by pretty much the closest thing you could imagine to a molecular turbine in the membrane.\n\nProtons are actually really well controlled across all sorts of biological systems, if you look at aquaporjns for example - channels that allow more water to diffuse across membranes they have conserved +ive residues near their pore as to purposely prevent protons from being able to equilibrate through the pore via ionisation chains between water ions.\n\n\nSimilarly if you look in active sites of enzymes you'll often find very careful exclusion of water and specific positioning and manipulation of protons such that we can actually trace and confirm that specific proteins are being swapped from one species to another rather than just random proton exchange from solution, the specific positioning of this effect can also lead to various stereoselectivity and control of reaction outcomes as well.",

Similarly, there is a wealth of research evidence to show that acidosis is caused by reactions other than lactate production. Every time ATP is broken down to ADP and P(i), a proton is released..  Thus increased lactate production coincides with cellular acidosis and remains a **good indirect marker** for cell metabolic conditions that induce metabolic acidosis. If muscle did not produce lactate, acidosis and **muscle fatigue would occur more quickly** and exercise performance would be severely impaired. \"\n\n [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15308499](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15308499)",

I have a ELI graduated high school version below, should be paragraph by paragraph.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\"Most qualified person on the face of earth to answer this specific question here.\n\nHeart muscle is both similar to and different from the muscles you use to move you around. The proteins that these muscles use to squeeze are similar, but the way they use energy and turn it into movement is very different.\n\nThe main reason behind heart muscle not getting tired is that they have twice the number of mitochondria, the part of cells that produces energy that your heart muscle can use. Know that mitochondria need oxygen.\n\nThe heart also can burn almost anything for fuel. Fats, sugars, and even lactic acid can all be turned into useable energy by the heart.\n\nLastly, heart muscles have great blood flow, and are better than other cells at pulling oxygen out of the blood stream. It is so good at pulling oxygen from blood that the only way to give your heart more oxygen is to increase the amount of blood flow, the heart cant pull harder.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing to add, I think that the blood coming out of the heart is the lowest blood oxygen concentration found anywhere in the body, which means it is the oxygen-sucking champ!",

Cardiac veins then return that extracted blood back into the right atrium which is the lowest O2 conc. after being extracted by the cardiac myocytes. \u201cBlood coming out of the heart\u201d makes it sound like the proximal Aorta - which is of course very high in O2. \n\nAnd as for all the Lactate comments above:\nIn medicine blood Lactate is simply used as a clinical marker for \u201csomething is wrong\u201d. It can be elevated in many conditions for different reasons. And only if there is a concurrent acidosis (blood pH &lt;7.35) with an elevated Lactate is it referred to as *Lactic Acidosis*. I believe it has the most evidence to be used as a sign of shock or sepsis, such as monitoring response to fluid bolus. Again it is just an indirect marker which tells us something is throwing off the metabolic balance. There\u2019s either decreased clearance or increased production, or both. Good article for anyone interested in the medical use of Lactate:\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3975915/",

Cell metabolism is our term for all the chemical reactions going on in a cell and allowing it to operate as it does. And you can think of chemical reactions as changes in the distribution of electrons around cores of atoms.  This distribution depends on how much energy each of the electrons has.\n\nIf you want to go down a rabbit hole, look deeper into photosynthesis for example. An attempt at an ELI 12:   \n \nIt starts by splitting electrons from molecules of water, creating oxygen and H+ ions. If nothing else happened to the electrons, they would shoot straight back to the oxygen and H+ ions and form water again.  \nThey aren't high enough in energy to go anywhere else - until light is stuffed into them, increasing their energy.  \nIn a series of steps, they are then attached to molecules that can store them, without too much of a loss in energy (NAD+/NADH, for example).  \nThese energy rich electrons are then used wherever the cell needs them - e.g. for shoving them up a CO2-molecule and attaching it to a sugarmolecule.  \nTwo things follow from this:  \n1. The plant can store energy during the day and get CO2 out of the air at night. The 2 steps needn't happen at the same time. Some plants do that.  \n2. If you keep creating energy rich electrons with nowhere to safely store them, sooner or later they wreck shit by causing unintended chemical reactions. Which means plants can get in trouble from getting too much light. It's called light stress and some plants have fascinating ways to cope with it.

The problem is glycolysis generates NADH with those high-energy electrons... but if you don't have oxygen available as the electron acceptor at the end of the electron transport chain, the whole process grinds to a halt. You then run out of NAD+ so you can't even run glycolysis. So what you do is \"waste\" some of the NADH by reducing pyruvate to lactic acid. Then you can run glycolysis as long as your glucose stores last (which, counting the glycogen in muscle and liver, is maybe running 30km). Glycolysis doesn't generate much ATP per glucose compared to oxidative phosphorylation, but it's a lot better than nothing.",

It uses an electrochemical gradient between the intermembrane space and the matrix of the mitochondria to provide work to literally squeeze an ADP and a phosphate ion together to create ATP. It's like a molecular water wheel and it's a god damned amazing piece of biological machinery.\n\nTo pump those protons back across into the intermembrane requires energy and most of it comes from in the form of NADH from the Krebs (Citric Acid) cycle. When NADH binds to Complex I it releases an electron that transfers via a series of redox reactions that go through Complex I, coenzyme Q, Complex III, cytochrome C, to Complex IV where it eventually oxidizes a proton using an oxygen molecule to form a water molecule. Along the way the redox reactions changes the shapes of proteins which pump protons out of the matrix against the electrochemical gradient and into the intermembrane. Once the proton has been pumped the electron moves on to the next slightly lower energy redox reaction until it finally reaches oxygen in Complex IV and forms water.\n\nSo that little electron does a lot of work while it makes energy for your cells. Without the electron transport chain your body would only get 10% of the energy it would receive if forced to ferment glucose anaerobically into lactate.",

More current research than this suggests that the body doesnt even produce lactic acid (it produces lactate, which is the conjugate base of lactic acid, but they're very different). \n\nNeither of these are the reasoning behind what people consider *the burn*, either. The short version is basically the body doesnt have enough oxygen (which assists in clearing out the hydrogen ions) and the buildup of hydrogen ions is partially responsible for *the burn*. The formation of lactate actually requires the absorption of some of those excess hydrogen ions, which helps reduce that burn.\n\nI don't mean to be overly pedantic, it just felt appropriate to share that information! I feel like we as a society have latched onto this idea of lactic acid being the enemy, and I feel like its important to be educated ya know? (:",

While cardiac tissue has the same organisation as skeletal muscle, its fibers are much shorter, so the force the heart has to exert is far less than that of skeletal muscle. \n\nCardiac muscle cells contain a much greater number of mitochondria per cell.  These provide energy in the form of ATP, at a much greater rate than skeletal msucle.\n\nBeing as close to the heart (because it is the heart), cardiac muscle also has a constant fresh supply of blood, providing vital oxygen and nutrients. This along with the factors mentioned above, make the heart much less susceptible to fatigue when compared to skeletal muscle.\n\nEdit: grammar",

            "comment": "Several correct answers here, but a different perspective or way of explaining :\n \nThere are three types of muscle, skeletal, smooth and cardiac. Skeletal muscles you use for voluntary movement and exercise, as you described arms/legs. Smooth muscles are the involuntary type like the intestines, blood vessels, respiratory tract, etc. Now cardiac is it\u2019s own specific type of muscle that is involuntary but acts quite differently.  Skeletal muscles are the only ones you feel soreness from after overexertion- and as another commenter mentioned, from the lactic acid release.",

            "comment": "Critical care specialist here. Your heart is okay at lower rates or faster when training during exercise. However it definitely can get \"tired\" if it was to beat excessively fast for prolonged periods. For example in patients who have irregular heartbeats that are sustained in the 100s, a lot of them will develop heart failure. The fancy medical term is 'tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy'.  Once you slow the heart down, the heart failure usually resolves within a few months.",

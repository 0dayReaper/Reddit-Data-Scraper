            "comment": "In spite of what textbooks tell you today, Lamarck was *not* taken particularly seriously. \n\nModern textbooks have chosen a hypersimplified version of Lamarckism as a contrast to Darwin, but the actual theory was very different from the textbook versions; it was a vague and silly mishmash of theism and undefined \u201clife force\u201d that\u2019s never mentioned in the textbooks today.\n\nIt was also obviously and self-evidently wrong, since there were many examples of acquired characteristics, applied over many generations, not being inherited. Darwin and his contemporaries dismissed Lamarck mockingly and with amused contempt, and were right to do so. In Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species, he mentions Lamarck, very briefly and in passing, just three times, and doesn\u2019t even bother to refute his theory.  Obviously to Darwin in 1859, and to the educated readers he expected to read his book, Lamarck \u201cwasn\u2019t even wrong\u201d - his theory was so nonsensical that it wasn\u2019t even worth discussing. \n\nWhy do people today think it was a serious, well-established, even mainstream theory? Because textbooks are lazy and copy each other. They expect a narrative where Genius A overthrows Genius B, instead of a true, but complicated, scenario where there was no real mainstream theory, a muddle of uncertain ideas, gradually pulled together at the same time by many different people. So they pretend that Lamarck was the dogma, so that they can pretend Darwin overthrew it.",

Long term plants and trees can cut their growth rates in periods of \"stress\" but not annual crops.  \n\n&gt;Consequences of Lysenkoism\n\n&gt;Lysenko forced farmers to plant seeds very close together since, according to his \"law of the life of species\", plants from the same \"class\" never compete with one another.\u00a0Lysenko played an active role in the famines that killed millions of Soviet people and his practices prolonged and exacerbated the food shortages.\u00a0The\u00a0[People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Republic_of_China)\u00a0under Mao Zedong adopted his methods starting in 1958, with calamitous results, culminating in the\u00a0[Great Chinese Famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chinese_Famine)\u00a0of 1959 to 1962, in which some 15\u201355 million people died.\n\n&gt;Outside the Soviet Union, scientists spoke critically: British biologist\u00a0[S.

Criticism from foreigners did not sit well with Lysenko, who loathed Western \"bourgeois\" scientists and denounced them as tools of imperialist oppressors. He especially detested the American-born practice of studying\u00a0[fruit flies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila_melanogaster), the workhorse of modern genetics. He called such geneticists \"fly lovers and people haters\".\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trofim_Lysenko",

If you try to do a multi-generation study of elephants, your grant money will probably run out long before you can publish, and you might die of old age to boot.\n\nA good example of this is the silver fox domestication experiment, whose results weren't published until after Dmitri Belyaev died.\n\nTraditionally, species that reproduce quickly enough to be good subjects for genetic studies have been ignored or actively regarded with contempt. For example, Martin Luther theorized that flies were created by Satan.\n\nCharles Darwin had to study historic paintings of spaniels to see how selective breeding had changed them. Anti-science fanatics have claimed that  bananas prove some deity created the world for humans, because they don't see the history of bananas.\n\nMendel kicked off genetic studies with very careful multiyear studies of wrinkles on the peas in his garden. It's not the kind of thing you would expect to start a major scientific revolution.\n\nEDIT: Somewhat off-topic, but eugenics will probably always be a dead-end  ideology, because even in the best case it would take many generations to work, and political ideologies don't live that long.",

It was a theory which offered support for the idea of a New Soviet Man, and the eugenics that backed that state goal to create one.\n\nLamarck himself was elevated to something akin to the status of Mendeleev.  His was seen as the true genetics, proof of the nation's dominance within the field.  The theory was elevated beyond its merit by the state *wanting* it to be true, for reasons of prestige and more sinister ones of influencing human behavior.  The money and influence that followed was positive reinforcement.\n\nAnd in the period of Stalin and the purges, when engineers were routinely accused of \"Wrecking\" and anyone who displeased the party could be sent to the Gulag or disappeared... there was a very powerful influence of negative reinforcement at work too.",

Also, a lot if the things that made evolution a lock weren\u2019t yet discovered: basic genetics wouldn\u2019t be known until Mendel\u2019s work was disseminated. the fossil record was very incomplete so its support of evolution was almost subjective at the time. Darwin struggled to account for the sudden appearance of complex structures of things like eyes, which I guess Lamarckianism better covered by implementing mystical nonsense (further research would eventually reveal that the eye didn\u2019t happen all at once). Finally, a lot of phenomena that supported evolution also supported Lamarckianism (ie: creatures being adapted to their environments).

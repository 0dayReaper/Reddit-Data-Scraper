By creating a new vaccine that doesn't use egg, it can remove that barrier. \n\nOther vaccines use older methods such as dead virus particles, which while effective, it can be hard to manufacture, distribute or store.  With advances in technology, vaccines that maybe only had a shelf life of a couple of months could now have a new version with a years long shelf life.  \n\nCost can also play a role.  If the old Polio vaccine was $4.75/dose and a new one can be sold for $4.25/dose, that's a huge cost savings when you account for the millions of doses given annually.  \n\nSpeed of manufacture will make it easier to produce on a more \"as needed\" basis, with less waste due to expiry.  A vaccine that requires 4-6 months to fully produce means that a stockpile of 8-12 months should be kept by the manufacturer and the administering agencies.  If that time can be cut down into weeks, then it requires less stockpiling and in the case of a large scale outbreak, it can meet demand much quicker and therefore be more effective.",

Generally speaking, DNA viruses mutate much more slowly than RNA viruses and thus have to be updated less frequently or not at all.\n\nOne of the reasons that people encourage vaccination is that most vaccines give partial immunity, and the more chances the virus has to spread, and interact across vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups, the more opportunities for mutation to occur, which could potentially render the vaccines useless over time.\n\nThis link discusses the structure of the viruses.\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2227269/#:~:text=Abstract,strand%20polarity%20of%207478%20bases.\n\nThis link suggests that the Hep A virus is mutating based on selective pressure and the existence of breakthrough infections in some who are vaccinated.\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6354442/\n\nIt looks like there also might be issues with Hep B mutation.\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-07085-z",

            "comment": "As someone else pointed out, it all depends on he mutation rate of the virus and if the vaccine is still effective after mutation. The difference with some \"traditional\" viruses vs covid is in how easily and fast covid is able to mutate and escape existing immune system recognition, requiring regular updates to ensure your body recognizes it. This is the hallmark of RNA based viruses that are lacking the repair mechanism to fix mutation that the DNA based viruses have. Some DNA viruses are for all intents and purposes the same virus that has been circulating for centuries, whereas you have seen RNA viruses like coronaviruses can mutate and escape detection in literal weeks and months.\n \nAnother consideration is how transmissible the virus is. A virus that is able to spread through the air rapidly leads to a greater number of infections and the greater chance to mutate. Viruses that spread only through ingestion or bodily fluids don't have nearly the infection rate and therefore mutate much more slowly through the population because they have less hosts. Combine that with a DNA virus and you have a vaccine that can last decades or longer.\n\nSo back to your point, mutation rate and severity of the mutation against the vaccine effectiveness is what determines if an update is needed, and the type of virus dictates what that mutation rate and severity will be. With the case of hepatitis vaccines, as far as I know they are mostly the same as when originally developed. There might be an occasional tweak over decades if they detect the virus has shifted, but as long as the same immunity is given there is no reason to update it.",

                    "comment": "This doesn't really answer OP's question, as, while hepatitis B virus is a DNA virus, hepatitis A virus is an RNA virus with an error rate multiple orders of magnitude higher than that of coronaviruses (which, unique among RNA viruses, have proofreading activity).\n\nAnd yet, as you point out, the hepatitis A vaccine does not need to get updated. The same story is true of, for example, measles virus, an RNA virus with a much higher mutation rate than coronaviruses (and massively more contagious), yet vaccine mediated-immunity is extremely stable.\n\nThe more important factors here are actually antigenic drift (and for the influenza portion of their question, antigenic shift) and stability. \n\nMeasles virus is famously antigenically stable. While the virus has a very high mutation rate overall (though on the low end compared to non-coronavirus RNA viruses), the portions of the virus that our immune systems target are under fairly rigid constraints and cannot tolerate mutations well. This means that, despite the high copy error rate, measles doesn't accumulate many mutations in the parts of its genome that are critical for the immune response.\n\nLike measles virus, hepatitis A virus also seems to have very strict constraints on its capsid (largely due to strong negative selection of variants with alternative codon usage), which again leads to high antigenic stability and only a single serotype.\n\nCoronaviruses and influenza viruses, on the other hand, are not under these constraints. Both accumulate lots of mutations in their most highly antigenic viral proteins (HA and NA for flu, spike for coronaviruses). \n\nThat said, these viruses do have some portions that are under stricter constraints than others, which are a focus of efforts to develop novel vaccines and therapeutics. For SARS-CoV-2, regions within the S2 portion of the spike are a lot more stable than S1, and for influenza the \"stalk\" portion of HA is under fairly strict constraints, so these represent appealing targets to focus on for more \"variant-proof\" immunity as the technology and understanding of how to do so improves.",

Hepatitis A virus (and other RNA viruses with vaccines, eg. measles virus), have substantially higher mutation rates than coronaviruses due to proofreading activity that is completely unique to coronaviruses among RNA viruses.\n\nOverall mutation rates alone do not explain the high antigenic stability of various RNA viruses with single serotypes and highly successful vaccines. The difference lies in the stability and evolutionary constrains of specific antigenic portions of the virus, rather than the fidelity of replication overall. While overall there may be relatively high genomic plasticity, if a specific region of the virus that immune responses are directed toward is under strict constraints, low serotype diversity is the result.\n\nEmerging coronaviruses and influenza viruses have relatively low antigenic stability, particularly for neutralizing antibodies. Also, while common cold coronaviruses (~10-20% of common colds) are actually thought to be relatively antigenically stable, reinfections happen due to rapidly waning immunity rather than diverse serotypes. Rhinoviruses, (~70% of common colds) do have vast serotypic diversity, though.",

Maybe not always with quite so much global drama and disorganization as our newest coronavirus caused in the last 3-4 years, but the  adaptive biological cycles are still pretty predictable and well-known for 130 years.\n\nAny doctors here want to weigh in on that?",

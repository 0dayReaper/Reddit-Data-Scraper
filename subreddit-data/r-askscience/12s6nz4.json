            "comment": "Set number of eggs? Yes. But it's in the low millions. Far more than the number of months between menarche and menopause.\n\nRather, the eggs themselves accumulate damage, and the endocrine and hormonal system that prepares them for fertilization and gestation degrades over time. (Aging degrades everything, and fertility for women is one of the first casualties that can't be compensated for with, e.g., experience.)\n\nSo, no, she doesn't run out of *eggs*, exactly, but she does run out of ability to prepare and release fertile eggs. Which is an important difference, biologically, but may feel like a distinction without difference for someone struggling with fertility issues.",

            "comment": "Not exactly: the same thing happens to sperm over time. If the human body did not suffer aging, the human body would retain fertile capability; if an old man had his youth restored but not his age, his hormonal balance would return to youthful productivity. The same can be said for women; age does not determine virile capacity, \"youth\" does.\n\nAs the body ages, the healing process \"taxes\" itself: for the body to heal, the body must also destroy itself (this is the role of chlorine in cell replacement). Eventually, processes begin shutting down as a result of this \"taxation\": our blood cannot keep up with our muscles and, as a result, the human body becomes infirm, starts \"burning reserves\". If medicine could improve the red blood cell's ability to function we might surmount aging and, if we did, we would see elderly folk return to virile youth. \n\nProbably has something to do with your RNA *as well* but, for the most part, your blood is the problem, not your ability to continue producing sperm or eggs.",

    "postText": "So, I was playing top trumps with my daughter, the Sea Life version (which i believe gets its data from the Encyclopaedia of Life), and my 6 year old daughter had the Sand Tiger Shark. She looked at the picture in which it looked pretty big and called the Weight stat. To her disbelief the card was beaten by my Beluga whale. They looked pretty similar, however her shark's weight of 87kg was dwarfed by the Beluga's 1,400kg. To explain why something of comparable size might have a weight of more than 15 times its rival i assumed it was something to do with bone density. However, my daughter then grabbed the Basking Shark card, which while twice as long as the Sand tiger shark had a weight of 5,200kg, or almost 60 times the weight. But they're both sharks she said, how come the Sand tiger is so light. I was stumped.\n\nCould someone explain why there is such a varying weight (density) between shark species so i can tell my daughter? If possible both from an anatomical perspective and a practical/evolutionary one (so why)?",

            "comment": "Weight and density are only related at constant volume. While sand tiger sharks are slender like an eel, belugas are chunky like a fire hydrant. This leads to greater volume. They also do not have the same length\n\nAs for why weight goes up so much more with length, you have to think about math (bummer, i know). You can think in terms of units, where length is in meters, area is in meters squared, and volume is in meters cubed. If length goes up by s factor of x, then area will go up by a factor of x squared, and volume will go up by a factor of x cubed! You can play with squares and cubes to prove this if you'd like. This also works with circles and spheres. \n\n\nSo hypothetically if a whale got \"twice as big\", assuming it's twice as long/wide/tall, the change in weight is 2x2x2 = 8!",

It still didn't make up for the 60 times factor of the basking shark weight Vs tiger. \n\nBut the explanation of profile helps a lot. Having looked at a few more images online I think the top trump picture  falsely represents the tiger sharks width, making it look much more chunky than it actually is.",

Genetics, environment, and food supply play a lot into how big a shark can get. But like most animals, there are various types of subspecies that have their own specific characteristics.",

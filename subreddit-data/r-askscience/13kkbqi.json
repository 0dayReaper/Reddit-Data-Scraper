    "postText": "I'll just give an example, Watermelon, I don't necessarily care about the rind but I don't know that either. What is the flesh made of? People always talk about the nutrients, the smaller stuff. But I'm looking for what is holding the fruit together. Watermelon is mostly water but if you try to pick up water, it would just fall out. Watermelon is able to keep all of it's water in so there must be something holding it all together? I've tried quick googling. My first thought was fiber but nothing has confirmed this guess. I was chewing on a watermelon a second ago and thought, ok I've swallowed all the juice/water, what am I chewing?\n\nCoreect me if I'm wrong but meats are made up of protein, the thing holding it together and plants are held up by cellulose (a type of fiber). Which makes me think watermelon and all fruits the same are held up by cellulose. \n\nTo add to this, what would the flesh of apples, bananas, and other fruits be made of?",

            "comment": "The flesh of (a fleshy) fruit is mostly made of a tissue called \u201cparenchyma\u201d. It\u2019s basically a bunch of cells that have much thinner cell walls than in other places in the plant. The walls are made of cellulose, some proteins, a sort of waxy substance called pectin, and sometimes more rigid polymers like lignin. The proportions of those vary plant to plant and organ to organ. The parenchyma tissue of a fruit usually doesn\u2019t have much lignin (one exception below) and the flesh of watermelon specifically doesn\u2019t have much pectin (compared to an apple), so in this case it\u2019s mostly cellulose. The parenchyma cells in fleshy fruits are also HUGE compared to the cells in a leaf or a stem. They get so huge because their vacuole, which is a giant storage organelle that takes up the majority of a cell\u2019s volume, fills with water and inflates the cell. When you bite in, you burst these vacuoles along with the cell wall and cell membrane and that releases all of the water and other flavor compounds. \n\nThe other thing in a fruit that you would feel when you bite in is the vasculature. All the water has to get there from the roots, and there is a system of vessels called the xylem that conducts the water there. Another related vascular system called the phloem moves sugars and other more complex compounds there from the leaves. These two vascular systems are analogous to the circularity and lymphatic systems in humans\u2026kinda. These vessels, in particular those in the xylem, have to withstand a lot of pressure without bursting/collapsing, and they have much thicker cell walls. Their cell walls also have a lot more of that rigid lignin polymer in them. Humans can\u2019t digest lignin (or cellulose for that matter) and these form the fiber that helps with your digestion, but you probably feel the lignin a bit more than the cellulose when you bite in.\n\nApples have more pectin in their cell walls but otherwise they\u2019re basically the same.",

With lots balloons attached together you can build a somewhat solid structure. Yet the structure is 99% air and putting it in a blender will show that it wasn't composed of solid material after all.",

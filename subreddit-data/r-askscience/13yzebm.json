            "comment": "Our body has mechanisms to not only induce and amplify inflammatory responses when necessary but also to turn off the response when is no longer required. The inflammation that happen because of physical exercise is a different type of stimulus than an inflammatory response to a pathogen or tissue damage. Just as an example interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a common pro-inflammatory cytokines. After infections IL-6 is produced by activation of the transcription factor NF-kB which at the same time induces the expression of a number of other inflammatory mediators. Exercise induces IL-6 with a mechanism involving activation of the c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK). The release of IL-6 after exercise also results in the production of IL-10 and IL-1 receptor antagonists which are anti-inflammatory cytokines and cortisol which also reduces the inflammatory response ([source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41577-019-0177-9#:~:text=Physical%20activity%20may%20thus%20be,%2Dmorbidity%2C%20of%20old%20age.))\nThe reason why the same cytokine exerts these very different effects as far as I know is still not completely clear. It is likely due to the specific type of inflammatory mediators that are produced along with IL-6 and also it probably depends on the duration of the stimulus since it's known that even the same inflammatory cue can have different results in an acute or in a chronic setting.",

But iron in sweat is not linear, in terms of sweat loss concentrations being directly related to iron concentrations.  \n\nIt\u2019s almost certain that hepcidin plays a role in this anemia equation.  I would not jump the gun though, as hepcidin is influenced by inflammation beyond exercise.  Anemia of inflammation.  So if you have other conditions, such as Chron\u2019s, which has higher elevated levels of hepcidin in response to inflammation, you have trouble loading iron properly.  Plus transferrin is part of this, and factors influencing ferritin release (weight loss, vitamin C).\n\nCortical hepcidin is definitely higher after exercise.  The brain is very susceptible to iron loading over time, and I\u2019m sure we have adapted to wonky iron levels after long periods of exercise (because of our natural stamina).  DMT1 is likely a huge target for future issues surrounding neurodegeneration.",

That is gradual progress that will yield results while not pushing you too hard too early. If over a 1hr workout you do a total of 40 reps total then next time use the same weight and aim for 41.\n\nYou will likely realize you can progress faster at times which in that case take advantage of when you feel good but don't try to increase too quickly by jumping 5-10lbs on each exercise every week.\n\nI have been doing this approach for the last 17 years, have never hit a plateau, and haven't gotten join pain from pushing too hard to fast",

Why should they switch to a heavier weights, are they training specifically for strength? Neural adaptations (i.e. more motor unit recruitment) occur over a large rep range, it's been repeatedly shown that strength and hypertrophy changes occur even at very high reps with sufficient intensity. Also some neural adaptations mainly occur through training at easier weights nowhere near 5rm (i.e. simply learning how to do the movements as a skill).\n\nIf they're progressing and doing fine on a programme that gets them the results they want for their goals I don't see any reason to switch to powerlifting strength block style training (3-5x5 or less).",

Rest periods for muscle training can be as simple as running a 3x/week PPL routine where you train certain muscle groups once per week. The muscles, tendons, and bones will have a week to recover before they are challenged again. But you can train other muscles in the meantime. \n\nBut there are other systems within your body too. All of your organs and bodily systems can be \"trained\" and exhausted.  Think of it in terms of capacity and depletion. When aspects of your body faces stresses that you are struggling to deal with, tissue receives forms of micro damage. When that tissue heals (with nutrition and rest), it rebuilds stronger and more resilient. This is one of the big principles behind healthy physical development.",

Our bodies adapting to the physical stress of exercise and repairing/rebuilding the damaged tissues stronger is how we increase strength and endurance over time. \n\nProgressive overload (the technique you are referring to) is when you slowly and incrementally increase weight with each workout you do. For instance, increasing your bench press by 5 lbs from the last workout. Do this every so often for a year and suddenly you've added 100+ lbs to your bench press. That old top set you used to struggle with is now your warm up weight. \n\nLimiting factors are genetics of course but also human anatomy. There is only so large and powerful that humans can really get naturally. Some people are \"freaks\" (in a good way) and can put up some incredible numbers naturally, the overwhelming majority people fall in the average category, and that is completely fine! The average lifter is going to be much stronger and physically capable than the average non lifter, both male and female. Another limiting factor would be diet. If you eat poorly, you won't see the gains and changes you want to see. If you absolutely perfect your diet and training to go hand in hand, you will see incredible results. Our bodies are fantastic machines and they will maximize the fuel we put into them, barring any kind of conditions that may prevent it. \n\nWhen you get to that maximum potential for your body, that's when people begin taking performance enhancing drugs or steroids to push themselves past that limit. I myself am on doctor prescribed testosterone replacement therapy because my testicles decided to go on strike in my early 30's or late 20's. My testosterone level now in my mid 30's is that of an 18-20 year old man in their absolute prime, and even a little beyond that, so I have seen enhanced performance because of this. Hopping on TRT is not going to make you into an IFBB pro bodybuilder. You'll see moderate increases to muscle gain and strength as well as increased mood, energy and libido. \n\nHope this provides more context for you!",

Bone mass density is strongly correlated to lean muscle mass, the same goes for height.\nFrom rate of hypertrophy to the actual hard limit of muscle someone can put on.\n\nSomeone with a narrow chest structure can be on all the HGH in the world, they're not going to build a Schwarzenegger like chest. You can't bench your way to a bigger, denser skeleton.\n\nIn terms of actual bodybuilding genetics are one of the most important things. Someone can build a substantial set of abs, and lean down to 10% body fat so they're sufficiently visible. But if they have bad insertions and uneven abs there's absolutely nothing they can do about it.\n\n\"Lean body mass and muscle strength are both associated with bone mineral density (BMD), which is known to be under strong genetic control.\"\n\n\"Our data confirm a significant correlation between lean body mass and BMD, which was consistent across the different sites of BMD measurements, with lean body mass explaining between 6% and 16% of the variance of BMD depending on the site measured. \"\n\nhttps://asbmr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1359/jbmr.1997.12.12.2076\n\nhttps://journals.physiology.org/doi/pdf/10.1152/ajpendo.1996.270.2.E320\n\nhttps://www.jci.org/articles/view/113125/pdf\n\nhttps://journals.physiology.org/doi/abs/10.1152/ajpregu.1996.271.2.R432",

Whenever we challenge our muscles with work that exceeds our current condition, we create micro tears in the muscles. When the heal (e.g., during rest days) those torn muscle fibers become stronger and more resistant to damage. This is overtly seen and experienced by the development of muscle mass and less obviously by improvement in neuromuscular ability. Importantly, the now stronger muscle is now more resistant to tearing and inflammation using the previous load, but by progressively increasing the loads over time, we develop the muscles' ability to resist inflammation with lower loads. In this sense, exercise is not \"anti inflammatory\" (it doesn't reduce the degree of inflammation) it makes the muscles more resistance to inflammation, fatigue, and failure by strengthening them.",

The more your body gets used to it, the less inflamed you get and the faster you recover.\n\nLong-term, it increases circulation, reduces fat, and improves all over health.",

The lowered blood volume is really an obstacle for me as I get \"runner's itch\" from _walking_. \n\nSo in a scientific ballpark estimate (that's a thing, right?) how long might I expect it to take to get some better blood circulation? My super itchy legs would like some hope and they say thanks.",

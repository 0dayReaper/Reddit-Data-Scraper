            "comment": "Yes, if my understanding of this article is correct:\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/science/25qna.html \n(I hope nytimes is an acceptable source, even if not academic)\n\nIn the linked article, John D. Kubiatowicz, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley says that for a kindle with 4 Gigabyte memory, this would mean a rough increase in weight of 10^\u201318 grams.\n\nFor your situation of a 60GB phone, this would mean \n(60Gb/4Gb) * (10^-18 grams) = 1.5 \u00d7 10^-17 grams.  So certainly less than what you would be able to feel.\n\nWhile I originally thought this would be because the storage would use extra electrons, the article/Prof. Kubiatowicz say otherwise:\n\n\"Although the total number of electrons in the memory does not change as the stored data changes,\u201d Dr. Kubiatowicz said, the trapped ones have a higher energy than the untrapped ones. A conservative estimate of the difference would be 10^\u201315 joules per bit.\n\n\"As the equation E=mc2 makes clear, this energy is equivalent to mass and will have weight.\"\n\nIt is my understanding that most/all mobile phones use flash memory for storage so the linked article about flash memory in Kindles would be applicable here.  Please let me know (or just delete this outright) if I am mistaken.\n\n*edited to fix exponent formatting\n \n\n",

In a non-isolated system the process of writing the data would lose heat energy, more than the data storage would add but that energy could be supplied from outside.  \nA proper comparison I think would be:  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nTwo identical phones, A and B with 60GB free each.  \nNeither has a battery and both are switched off.  \nBoth are simultaneously plugged in to an external power source and switched on.  \nA writes data to its 60GB. B does not.  \nBoth are simultaneously switched off and disconnected from the power.  \nBoth are given time to equalise their temperatures.  \n&amp;nbsp;  \nI think then we would expect A to have a slightly greater mass as it has drawn and retained more power while it was processing and storing the data.",

Because the act of deleting is more related to the file system used than the type of storage media, it's pretty much the same, but ultimately depends on what you define as \"delete\".

When a charge is stored in the floating-gate, the transistor does not conduct when voltage is applied to it, and thus it reads as a logical 0. An uncharged FG make the transistor conductive, reading a logical 1. Therefore erased flash memory set to all 1s would consist of uncharged floating-gates, and would be the lightest state.",

Basically what it would decay to given infinite amount of time. \n\nSo if the answer is in the middle, the natural state would be roughly 50% randomly distributed of both and then all 1's and all 0's would both weigh more than a randomly distributed state, and they would weigh the same. \n\nHowever, if 0's are the ground state, and 1's are some excited state, then given infinite amount of time the system would tend towards mostly 0's, and being filled with all 1's would be the *heaviest* state.\n\nWith magnetic media, I believe both states are roughly equally probable, because you're flipping a magnetic charge which has two sides, like rotating a ball so the North Pole points up or down, thus it would be more like the former situation, randomly distributed.\n\nFlash media uses an electric charge, electrons specifically, which is more of a 'charged or not charged' state, so in that case it would be more like the latter situation, where all 1's would weigh the most, and the closer you get to all 0's the less mass.",

(Alternatively, if a bit is supposed to be the mass of an electron, wolframalpha tells me that's 0.9109383 x 10^-32 so probably well within in a rounding error as the joules were heavily rounded I assume.)\n\nSo for the hell of it, I'm using 1x10^-32 kg = 1 bit (or electron).\n\nNow the mass of a strawberry. Wolframalpha tells me 12g or 0.012 kg. So how many bits are in a strawberry?\n\n0.012 kg / 1x10^-32 kg/bit = 1.2x10^-2 * 1x10^32 = 1.2x10^30 bits. That would be 1.5 x 10^(29) bytes.\n\nThat's a lot.\n\n~~Wolframalpha estimates the deep web for 3 years ago to be 91,000 Terrabytes. And the surface web to be 170 TB. 91,170 TB. But for the hell of it, let's say Moore's Law applies to data creation on the web and we'll raise it to 2^(3/2) power for doubling every two years, but it's three years later. We could kick this to being nearly 260,000 TB.~~\n\nNo. Wolfram was dumb for a moment (*two* moments, as explained in comments below). Searching Internet Size, the 2014 estimate is 1x10^6 Exabytes which is 1 Yottabyte. \n\nThat's a few magnitudes short of a strawberry in terms of raw data. The 1.5 x 10^29 bytes is 1.5 x 10^5 or 175,000 Yottabytes. A strawberry is still a lot more.\n\n\nHowever! If we mean to look at just the DNA inside of a Strawberry, that's a different question to tackle. I imagine it brings it ~~into the realm~~ too low, given how massive DNA is, requiring many atoms to make one bit.\n\nOh, but that's also true. I treated my numbers to be fully electrons, but if we convert to each atom being a bit, that would help bring it into a similar magnitude.",

This means that changing a few bits over and over again (eg. frequently saving a document you're working-on) won't always charge the same capacitors, so they won't wear out quickly. It also means that filling up your device with data will cause a random ~50% of cells to be charged, even if the bits in your data are almost all '1's",

Trapped energy exhibits all the properties of mass: that is, it has inertia and an increased gravitational field.\n\nAs a thought experiment, imagine you could construct a box whose insides are lined with ideal perfect mirrors (completely lossless reflection).  If you were able to inject visible light into such a box, say a few trillion photons, the photons would bounce back and forth inside the box.  Moving the box, you'd find it would have more inertia than a box absent photons. This is because you have to actually impart momentum to the photons inside the box, as well as the box itself, to move it (yes, photons can have momentum).\n\nSimilarly, there is a theoretical object that physics says is definitely possible called a Kugelblitz -- if you shine ridiculously powerful lasers onto a single point, all the photons in that area are so dense that their gravitational field can create a black hole.  A black hole made entirely of trapped photons.  So light even has gravity.\n\nSo energy has mass in that it has inertia and generates a gravitational field.\n\n\n",

And general relativity tells us that's true regardless of whether it's mass or not.\n\nThat being said, in modern times we define \"mass\" as being proportional to the energy of an object in its own rest frame in flat spacetime. You can have cases where part of that mass is actually some kind of energy (kinetic, electromagnetic, etc.) if you look closely enough - for example, if you have light bouncing around inside a closed box, the box behaves in every way as if its mass includes the electromagnetic energy of the light.",

This is because the gravitational force depends on the stress energy tensor in general relativity. The stress energy tensor 00 component is the total energy of the body, which includes the rest mass plus the kinetic energy of the object. Temperature differences means that there is a different amount of kinetic energy in the motion of the atoms of the two bodies.\n\n&gt;For example, if you start with two identical kilograms of water at 0 Celsius, and if you then heat one of them to 100 Celsius, then the kilogram at 100 Celsius would be heavier by an amount equivalent to 4.6 nanograms of additional water weight\n\nEdit: fix broken link",

Phones generally use Solid-State drives for memory (like Flash).  In SSDs a 0 or 1 is stored by using quantum tunnelling or hot carrier emission to \"strand\" charge/electrons on the \"floating island\" of a floating gate transistor.  So leaving electrons behind is exactly how they work.\n\n&gt;A follow up point is that a fully charged phone has the same mass as a dead phone, since charging only increases the chemical potential energy of the battery.\n\nAlso not true.  There's this little equation called E=mc^2 . States of different potential energies have different masses.  In fact that's WHAT mass is, energy of a bound state.",

A change in the energy levels of electrons is virtually undetectable from a weight perspective.  We can calculate out the possible differences, but they are in the 10^(-18) range of a difference.\n\nIn order for the question to be relevant, you would need to double the precision of your orders of magnitude.  To put it in perspective, you would need to take a particle on the nano level and grow it to human proportions.   Then you\u2019d need to measure the difference in nano based weight on the enlarged particle to notice anything. ",

Main memory like DDR memory is based on capacitors and, due to the \"leaky\" nature of capacitors, needs to be refreshed hundreds of times a second to prevent data loss. Both are technically forms of RAM because neither has a sequential nature, unlike progressive sectors on a spinning disk.",

Data saved on your phone is stored on the existing infrastructure, so if you keep your phone in a vacuum and download a bunch of movies the mass of your phone remains constant. Similarly, your battery is the same mass whether full or empty, the electrons simply move around from what I understand. You can write and unwrite data to a storage device all day long and the mass should stay the same.",

            "comment": "In short, the answer  would be yes. But the answer is much longer than that, since it also depends on: \"how does your phone store data?\" and most importantly \"what is data?\".\n\nFirst let's use an example like a hard drive, that uses a magnetic head to record the data bit by bit in the metalic disk, each bit corresponds to a tiny sector of the disk that is magnetized either positive or negative. In this case, the difference of mass from a empty drive and a full drive would be basically none, since there wasn't really a \"change of state\" in the parts inside of the hard drive (except for the circuits that drive the magnetic head) but the data storage part of it mostly stay with the same number of electrons and overall mass.\n\nNow, if we're talking about solid state data, or data that is recorded in a method that utilizes transistor states, then I'd say that the difference in mass would be less negligible but still it is just extra electrons in the form of stored data, since this time you'd have to \"turn on\" some transistors in order to store the data. It would also depend on the configuration of the transistors, some my weigh more empty than full if they're p-type transistors.\n\nThe difference of weigh would also be so little... I even found this example that was set by a professor, while talking about solid state data:\n\n\"Prof John Kubiatowicz, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, explained that storing new data involves holding electrons in a fixed place. Using Einstein's E=mc\u00b2 formula, which states that energy and mass are directly related, Prof Kubiatowicz calculated that filling a 4GB Kindle to its storage limit would increase its weight by a billionth of a billionth of a gram, or 0.000000000000000001g.\"\n\n",

For example, you could also calculate your phones thrust from the light leaving the screen, or the weight of the battery charged vs not charged, ect.

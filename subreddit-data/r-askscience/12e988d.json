It also seems that the less they can rely on facial mimics (i.e. brachycephalic dogs) the more diverse their vocal repertoire.\n\nHowever research about the impact of facial morphology diversity on their intraspecific communication is scarce. On the other end, Alexandra Horowitz showed dogs succeed in the \u201cmirror test\u201d only from the moment the test is transferred from a sight-based test to a scent-based one, demonstrating that they rely a lot more on olfaction than on sight.\n\n[Paedomorphosis affects agonistic visual signals of domestic dogs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S000334729690370X)\n\n[Vocalization of European wolves (Canis lupus lupus L.) and various dog breeds (Canis lupus f. fam.)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285768356_Vocalization_of_European_wolves_Canis_lupus_lupus_L_and_various_dog_breeds_Canis_lupus_f_fam)\n\n[Social behaviour of dogs and related canids.](https://www.cabidigitallibrary.org/doi/10.1079/9781845931872.0105)\n\n[Smelling themselves: Dogs investigate their own odours longer when modified in an \u201colfactory mirror\u201d test](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376635717300104)",

Therefore, brachycephalic dogs have skull bones that are shortened in length, giving the face and nose a pushed-in appearance.\n\nI hadn't heard this term before so I looked it up. This is what I guessed it meant based on the context but I like to learn new-to-me words. I figured I might not be the only one first encountering it.",

It's why \"all Asian people look the same to me\" is kinda true. \n\nIf you spend your entire life surrounded by one group, and only know one Chinese person, say, then your brain takes a shortcut - \"Steve's the Chinese dude.\" It doesn't need to store more than that. And yeah, you see Chinese people on TV etc, but it's not important for your brain to remember the differences between them, so you can basically remember them as \"not Steve\" kinda thing. \n\nIf you get to know a second Chinese person, then your brain has to pick differences. Steve is the tall guy. Or has longer hair. Or whatever. \n\nThen, you move to China. Suddenly your brain needs to learn the differences between 1000 Chinese people, and if finds ways. \n\nThe same is true of, say, beer - if you don't really drink beer, it all tastes the same. Yes, even two \"drastically different\" beers, because the distinction doesn't matter. It's not until you need to tell the difference, during a tasting or whatever, that you can tell. And you can train your brain to identify 20 different light, mass-produced beers that most people can't tell apart. \n\nSame for wine, cars, trees.... your brain won't study the details unless you start comparing them.",

I have to attempt to replay the conversation from memory. The more conversations I have with Alice in memory, the more likely one will contain her name. Also contextual clues, like where I met them, help.\n\nThis can be a slow process, taking a few seconds, and if Alice is running toward me, yelling \u201chi, Ash!\u201d that\u2019s a distraction that slows it down even more. Add in the tendency of neurotypical people to associate \u201cremember my name\u201d with \u201cI am important to you\u201d, and it can be socially devastating. I still remember with a wince a person who happily greeted me and I blanked and offended her and I to this day have *absolutely no idea* who the hell she was, though I remember her face like a photograph. I may have met her sometime when she looked very visually different, people changing haircuts etc throws me off.",

There are a lot of factors that might impact the effectiveness of identification within and across species for different animals, which other comments have addressed.\n\nFrom a neuroscience perspective, however, I do know that humans CAN identify animals as distinct from one another (has primarily been done on monkey faces)\u2026in infancy.  This is the neurological idea that we have an over-proliferation of neurons when we are born, which become increasingly specialized based on exposure.  So if you see as many elephant faces as you see human faces in the first months of life, there is a good chance you would be able to tell them apart as easily as you tell humans apart.  This also explains why some people feel that different races may result in less distinction - it does NOT, but those individuals may have been less exposed in their infancy to diverse faces, so they may have fewer specialized neurons for identifying those facial characteristics.  This is also how babies learn their native language, by the way.\n\nYou can learn to identify faces of many species, just like you can learn a new language.  But you have to rely on neuroplasticity - your brain\u2019s ability to make new connections - it won\u2019t be automatic or \u201cinnate\u201d like recognizing human faces or recognizing your native language. \n\nA few interesting articles to expand on this - this has been studied for a while, so these articles are just two of many:\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97999&amp;page=1\n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0406627102",

That is not to say that they DONT visually discriminate between individuals, but rather that it is not necessarily the primary means of identification.\n\nSince humans communicate primarily vocally, and this source of communication originates from the mouth/face, it makes sense that we primarily look at eachothers faces.

You can make good use of quite limited variability in a set of characteristics if you\u2019re good at detecting that variation. If you had ten different facial features and you could distinguish ten variations for each feature they would be enough for ten billion unique faces.\n\nThe big issue for us in distinguishing animals from each other is not necessarily less variability in them, but that we haven\u2019t spent our whole lives learning what features matter in telling them apart. From the moment you\u2019re born you are unconsciously practicing the art of identifying and understanding human faces.\n\nWe can see very clear demonstrations of this in auditory processing. There is evidence that humans are born with the potential to hear all possible human speech sounds. But as we grow up in a particular culture we lose the ability to distinguish the ones that aren\u2019t used (or aren\u2019t distinguished) in our local language. \n\nFor example, some languages distinguish multiple versions of what in English would be considered all the same hard T sound. You can make something like a hard T using many (slightly) different positions for the tip of your tongue, but most English speakers won\u2019t notice or understand the differences between them. Try saying T but each time let your tongue touch a different position a bit further forward or back on your palette and pay close attention to the different sounds you get. There is a continuity at the front with the \u201cth\u201d sound.\n\nA reverse example is the use of \u201cch\u201d and \u201csh\u201d in English. Some languages don\u2019t particularly make sue of this distinction, and people from those language areas learning English may mix up words like \u201cchock\u201d and \u201cshock\u201d when listening or speaking.",

We have an insane amount of genetic diversity because humans come from descendants of Homo sapiens evolved to different regions and lifestyles and the interbreeding of many different archaic human species such as Neanderthals, homo erectus, Denisovans, etc. \n\n(sorry for bad grammar/spelling, I\u2019m on mobile and too tired to edit) \nI just wanted to share the idea so you can explore more on your own.\nPBS First Peoples is a really good docu-series",

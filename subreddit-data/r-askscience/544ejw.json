This becomes a problem for space probes, because electronics and power supplies turning on and off create heat in the infrared spectrum, and these infrared photons cause a small thrust which over long periods of time will cause the probe to veer off course.\n\nThere's actual computer simulation and modeling done at NASA to account for this infrared-thrust effect when setting probe trajectories and course corrections.",

Scientists and engineers end up specializing in different things as their careers progress.  Some will specialize in fuel, for instance.  Another in fuel pumps, perhaps.  Others will end up specializing in managing projects like what you're talking about.  So when NASA or someone wants to do a project, they start by hiring a scientist who is very good at managing projects, and then he goes out and hires other scientists of other specialties depending on what the project is.  \n\nSource: I'm a scientist (engineer) who manages projects of hundreds or sometimes even thousands of other scientists, engineers, and technicians.",

I got trained in Six Sigma and all that and ran several small projects with the goal of implementing Lean and similar principles.  But interestingly, not in a factory, like those things were developed for.  But among other engineers and scientists doing their \"production\" of intellectual goods.  It was a different twist, but it largely worked if I was creative enough in the application.  It was a great way to get my feet wet managing teams especially from diverse fields working together.  Some of my projects had small teams but ended up having very large impacts.  It's been a few years, but those were fun.",

            "comment": "Yes, very slowly.\n\nLight has momentum, even though it is massless, so if you shoot a beam of light in one direction, conservation of momentum will push you in the opposite direction.\n\nA reasonably powerful LED flashlight will use about 1-3 Watt, lets say 3 W. The efficiency of a LED is somewhere between 25% and 40%, so for sake of ease of computation lets make that 33% and we get a net amount of light output of 1 W. \n\nThe ratio between the momentum and energy of light is 299,792,458 (Which is also the speed of light). So in 1 second, the flashlight produces 1 J worth of light, which is equal to 0.33 * 10^-8 kg m/s. If the flashlight is not too heavy, say 100 gram or 0.1 kg, that means that 1 second of light would propel the flashlight to a velocity of 10^-7 m/s. This assumes that all light is directed in straight line. The more cone-shaped the bundle of light is, the lower the momentum transfer is.\n\nLeaving the light on for one day would propel the flashlight to about 0.009 m/s or almost 1 cm per second. Unfortunately, operating a 3 W LED for a day uses about 260 kJ of energy. Regular AA batteries have somewhere around 10 kJ of energy (depending on the type). And at a weight of 20-30 grams per battery, you can't carry put more than 2-3 in the device without violating our original assumption of a 100 gram device.",

Awesome calculation... thanks!\n\nSuppose we were to create the usually-a-joke \"solar powered flashlight\" and keep it in that weight profile. I'm not sure of the efficiency of our best solar cells currently, and I'm not sure it would be sufficient to generate 3W even if all the battery weight was replaced with a solar system, but at whatever trickle it gave, would that provide a basically unlimited (albeit ridiculously low power) propulsion system? Does the acceleration continue to build up over time (1cm/s day 1, 2cm/s day 2, etc) or would it hit an exceedingly low maximum speed in relatively short order (ignoring the effects of gravity and such). I'm having amusing visions of a tiny flashlight puttering off through deep space for all eternity. \n\nEdits for grammar.",

                            "comment": "What you're suggesting is an inefficient approach to building a \"solar sail\". Instead of catching the sunlight with a solar panel, converting it to electricity and then using said electricity to power a flashlight, with losses at every step along the way, you can simply take a large reflective surface and let the sunlight bounce off it.\n\nThe incoming sunlight has some momentum and when reflected completely, the outgoing light has equal and opposite momentum, which means that the net gain in momentum by the spacecraft is twice the momentum of the incoming light. By changing the angle of the reflective surface with respect to the incoming sunlight, you can steer the craft.\n\nYou'll only ever be able to move away from the sun in this way, not closer. But the same is true if you would capture the light with solar cells and use it to power a flashlight (which can shine in arbitrary direction), since capturing the light with a solar panel also causes a momentum transfer from the sunlight to the craft.",

(But if you're building up *that* much speed, escaping from the solar system is probably your goal in the first place.)\n\nIt might take a *lot* of repetitions, but this could probably get you going *very* fast ... as in 'best described by % of light speed' fast. Could be tricky in a solar system where there are lots of planets and asteroids, though. Hitting something or at least being thrown off by the gravity of a big planet could be significant risks.\n\nAlthough, thinking of the gravity of big planets... If you timed and aimed it right, you could use Jupiter's gravity to turn your sail-ship around, instead of relying on the sun's gravity to eventually pull you back, enabling you to make lots of smaller, quicker, more productive trips without ever getting too far from the sun. Using this technique, you could accelerate much faster, at least until you approach Jupiter's escape velocity.",

Then if we angle the sail one way \\ then the craft will be pushed &lt;--- this way but if we angle it the other way / we get the opposite ---&gt; direction. If you were to angle the sail 90\u00b0 so that is was facing the sun you'd get a push \"down\" outward, which is like burning toward a radial outer node. This would push your perihelion closer to the sun and your aphelion toward the outer system. But with this configuration there is no way to burn toward a radial inner node since the sun is that way, and when either accelerating or decelerating you'd always end up with a slight radial out acceleration. There's ways to plan your flight around these obstacles but a chemical rocket is much more \"point &amp; shoot\" by comparison.",

Firstly, anything flying through space, in some sense, is in perpetual motion (unless it hits something). In this case, there is also a \"perpetual acceleration\", however it is not limitless acceleration. As the spacecraft get farther and farther apart, the intensity of the light will get lower and lower due to the physical impossibility of creating (and reflecting) a perfectly collimated beam of photons. In practice, the photons bouncing back and forth would be mostly lost due to missing the reflectors very quickly for anything farther than ~1km for a 1m^2 reflector pair. Secondly, even if you could somehow create a perfect reflector and a perfect light beam, the beam itself looses energy (redshifts) at every bounce as a function of the momentum transfer (conservation of mass/energy). The speed limit of the reflector pair would be reached asymptotically, and would have a kinetic energy equal to the initial photon energy contained in the beam.",

You'd need to have another layer that doesn't transmit much heat by conduction but is permeable to infrared in between the two. \n\nDepending on how good you are at laying down thin films, I guess you could create voids in between the two layers. Something like that would be really fragile and wouldn't fold well though. \n\nYou could fill the voids with a substance that keeps the voids from collapsing but disappears once the sail is deployed, like (idk) water or something.

To conserve the overall momentum of +*p* that we started with, the spaceship must be traveling at +2*p*.\n\nIf you want to be accurate to higher order you would need to consider the fact that the reflected photon is going to be redshifted slightly, losing energy and momentum. Lets call that loss of momentum *dp*. Then the reflected photon carries momentum *p*-*dp* (but in the negative direction) and the spaceship has 2*p*-*dp*, slightly less than twice the initial momentum. In practice *dp* is quite small compared to *p* and can be neglected in calculations.",

I'm familiar with the idea of solar sails, but didn't put two and two together that this was basically another (much worse) version of one. The point that the intake of sunlight striking the solar panels would also have an effect is another good one - given the lossiness of solar power conversion, it sounds like a losing proposition!\n\nYou mention that with solar sails that you can only ever move away from the sun, which of course makes sense... have we done enough work to know if one can use a solar sail to tack, like one can with a sailboat, in order to move in a generally windward (sunward) direction? Light obviously operates in a very different way from air currents, so I wouldn't expect that it's necessarily possible. Would the use of adjustable prisms to bend or redirect light in the desired direction allow for more flexible steering with a solar sail, or would the light entering the prism still impart too much undesirable momentum even though it's redirecting most of the intake?\n\nSorry for all the follow-ups, this is tickling my fancy.",

It is particularly relevant to earlier mentions about EMDrives and Newton's third law.\n\nThe consequence is this:\n\nEprop &gt;= pc\n\nwhere Eprop is the \"propulsive energy\", that is, the energy required to generate momentum p using a reaction engine. This input energy must always be at least pc. In an \"ordinary\" rocket engine, this energy is supplied primarily in the form of the rest mass energy Er = mc^2 of the rocket propellant. In a photon engine or other massless-propellant engine, _all_ this energy has to be supplied by the power generator. This is why that photon engines are extremely inefficient. And there doesn't appear to be any way around it: Einstein's laws say that if you have that much momentum, then at least pc worth of energy MUST exist in that system, either in rest mass or in something else.\n\nAny engine with even a small amount of massive propellant will, therefore, be FAR more efficient than a photonic engine. One can minimize the propellant arbitrarily by jacking the exhaust velocity. Of course, as the mass of propellant approaches 0, the bare minimum energy requirement from the power generator must approach pc. That's the main trouble, making an engine which can produce high thrust with very high exhaust velocities at a reasonable mass, of a massive propellant. Ideally we'd like a spacecraft that is more ship than it is propellant mass, but to do that we need insane exhaust velocity to reach any reasonable speeds.\n",

Yes. But it is going to take a long time.\n\nShort answer - If you throw the flashlight in the direct-opposite direction of the space craft. Yes.

But if you want to go faster, you have to give it more gas.\n\nWith a flashlight, the acceleration would be very slow. If you turned it on for a second, you would barely move at all. But if you leave it on for awhile, that tiny amount of acceleration will compound on itself. By the time it dies you'll have reached the maximum velocity, because you cant accelerate anymore.",

Given that sources of artificial light are not evenly distributed on the Earth (see: http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/55000/55167/earth_lights_lrg.jpg), are we propelling the Earth in some direction? Granted, the Earth is huge, and I imagine atmospheric scattering of light would dampen this effect, but is this theoretically happening? I would imagine that since most artificial light is used at night, if this were to be happening, we would be propelling ourself in the direction of the sun.",

Mass is important for calculating force and stuff like that, but weight and mass are not synonymous.\nSo you're (mostly) true in your claim that things are weightless in space, but they still have mass.",

The amount the flashlight could move due to the photons leaving the flashlight is a function of the amount of photons and the mass of the flashlight.  The force of the ejecting photons must overcome the inertia of the flashlight's mass.",

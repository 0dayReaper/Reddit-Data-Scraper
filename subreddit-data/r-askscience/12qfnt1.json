            "comment": "To my knowledge low blood pressure as an essential diaease does not exist or is extremely rare. Too low perfusion does cause organ damage, but that is secondary to blood loss, cardiac failure or disease like Addison\u2019s. There is some speculation that low blood pressure might increase the risk for normotensive glaucoma, but I have not seen research papers, just expert opinions.\n\nNormal blood pressure for people in hunter-gatherer populations is around 90/60mmHg, so anything above that should be fine if it doesn\u2019t cause lightheadedness or other symptoms.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammer_syndrome is one possible disease where blood pressure falls too low, but it\u2019s not a clearly defined medical entity.",

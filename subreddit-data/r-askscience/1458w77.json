These reactions can be endothermic, too.",

The kinetic energy of the neutron has no relation to the amount of energy that\u2019s released from the reaction. \n\nI got it in my head for some reason that the higher the KE of the neutrons, the more energy involved in the system/reaction overall \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",

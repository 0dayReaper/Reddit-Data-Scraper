            "comment": "The word \"crab\" is much older than the science of sorting animals into families and orders and genuses and species. To the Germanic peoples who fished along the Northern European coast, the animals they called [\"krabbi\" or \"crabba\" or \"crabs\"](https://www.etymonline.com/word/crab) were *most commonly* the European green crab, but more generally  meant anything in the water that had pincers, a bunch of legs, and a short or missing tail.\n\nIn 1758, Carl Linnaeus published his tenth edition of *Systema Naturae*, in which he organized thousands of animals under classes, orders, and genera. Crabs, lobsters and their kin all fell under *Insecta*, and having no wings, the order *Aptera*. To separate them from other \"wingless insects\" like spiders, centipedes and termites, Linnaeus [assigned them all to the genus *Cancer*, the Latin word for \"crab\"](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/10277#page/647/mode/1up). (Like most scientific works of that time, *Systema Naturae* was published in Latin.)\n\nSo at this point in history, according to Linnaeus, *all* hard-shelled sea creatures with ten legs and pincers were \"crabs\" (or at least *Cancer*), including not just today's \"false crabs\", but also lobsters, shrimp, and some parasites! The European green crab was *Cancer maenus*, the American lobster was *Cancer homerus*, etc, etc.\n\nNevertheless, Linnaeus separated *Cancer* into two sub-groups: the *brachyuri* (Greek for \"short tails\"), which were the \"crab\" crabs, the members of *Cancer* that one might also find called \"crab\" on a dinner plate or at a fish market. The other sub-group of *Cancer* was called the *macrouri* (Greek for \"long tails\"). By the 12th edition, [hermit crabs were included among the \"long tails\"](https://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/id/PPN362053723?tify=%7B%22pages%22%3A%5B516%5D%2C%22pan%22%3A%7B%22x%22%3A0.451%2C%22y%22%3A0.959%7D%2C%22view%22%3A%22toc%22%2C%22zoom%22%3A0.275%7D) as *Cancer tubularis*; king crabs were placed among the short-tails as *Cancer maja*.\n\nLinnaeus eventually died, and others expanded on his work, greatly increasing the number of orders and genera, and rearranging genera as our understanding of their relationships to one another improved. *Cancer* was eventually split into hundreds of different genera...\n\n...but the brachyuran \"short tails\" and the macrouran \"long tails\" remained. Except instead of being sub-groupings of a single genera *Cancer*, these became \"infraorders\", and the many renamed genera were assigned to one or the other. At this point, any brachyuran was considered a \"crab\", and the macrourans were \"not crabs\".\n\nBetween 1834 and 1840, H. Milne Edwards published [*Histoire Naturelle des Crustac\u00e9s*](https://repository.naturalis.nl/pub/318991), in which he redefined relationships between various crustacean genera and introduced a third infraorder: the *Anomura*, meaning \"different tailed\". Into this (much smaller) group went members of both the *Brachyura* and *Macroura* that didn't quite fit into either parent group...including the formerly brachyuran king crab, and the formerly macrouran hermit crab.\n\nAnd so, this brings us more or less to the present day. *Macroura* has since been retired as an infraorder, but *Brachyura* and *Anomura* remain. And *Brachyura* is *huge*, over 7,000 species across 98 different famlies...there are about as many \"true crabs\" as there are *all other decapods*, including false crabs, lobsters, and shrimp. (In the *Anomura*, there are \\~500 species of hermit crab and \\~100 species of king crab, for example.)\n\nSo. How did we determine which groups to call \"true crabs\"? We started with a huge group called *Cancer* (Latin for \"crab\") that contained basically every crustacean, and gradually took other things out of that group that weren't as closely related...in the process removing some other animals called \"crabs\" like hermit crabs, porcelain crabs, and king crabs.\n\nAnd was there a scenario where the classification could have been reversed? Not very likely...the number of \"true crabs\" is so large, and they are all more closely related to each other than any of them are to something like a king crab or a hermit crab...their sheer abundance, combined with their familiarity as a food source, made it most likely that they would always end up being the \"true\" crabs.",

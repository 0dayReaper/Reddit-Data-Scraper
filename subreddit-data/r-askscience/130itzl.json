Some people can't voluntarily control this muscle. For those people, a similar sound can be produced by clenching your fist tightly and pressing it to your ear.\n\nMuscles vibrate when you contract them. This is the vibration being heard in both cases above.",

It's a muscle, so I assume one can strengthen it which in turn strengthens one's control over it. A bit like doing kegel exercises. Funny, now that I try that down there I can also hold the ear strain a bit longer simultaneously. Maybe the mental focus helps a bit as well when you're not just trying to hold one thing.",

It normally tenses in response to very loud sounds as a way to very slightly reduce their intensity. I use this principal daily at work as part of audiologic evaluations in a test called acoustic reflex threshold testing. Some people are able to elicit this at will, and therefore also suppress which kind of fucks with my test sometimes lol but it's obvious when it's happening.",

When it was manufactured?\n\nI'm pretty sure there have been creative methods to answer both questions *highly specifically to a specific metal or alloy in a specific context*, with interesting results, but what may have worked on a Chinese bronze sword's copper carbonate patina (just making something up) to know when it was buried wouldn't be generally useful to know when a steel nail found in a piece of driftwood was manufactured for example.\n\nOr, you just throw it in a mass spectrometer and compare it to stuff you *do* know the age and provenance of, and say 'yes, that's 8th century Afghan gold based on the \\[whatever spike in whatever other element\\] and the stylistic match.'\n\nOr, maybe you have a nail that was pounded into a tree and work out when it was nailed into the tree with dendrochronology down to a time of year because \\[elaborate series of preservation-helping lucky breaks\\].\n\nIf it's meteoritic nickel-iron, you could also look at its chemistry to know which no-longer existent protoplanet it came from the core of, and I think we have some isotopic dates for when those each a'sploded in the early solar system (but it's all pretty close together, IIRC? None after the Late Heavy Bombardment?). Point being, if it hasn't been heated since landing on Earth, you can know which chunk it came from at the very least, and some absolute dates about where the metal came from, billions of years ago, which isn't very archaeologically significant necessarily....",

C14 works because it is constantly created in the atmosphere by cosmic rays and how it gets into the food of a tree or a person is well worked out.  Potassium Argon works because the Argon gets trapped in the rocks.  So you know when the rock solidified.  However in any case the dating method has error bars.",

To get rid of the oxygen, you need something the oxygen wants to bind with better than iron.  This is carbon monoxide, which will steal an oxygen from the iron to form carbon dioxide. You get the carbon monoxide from burning coal products (coke) or charcoal.  However, some carbon will instead get trapped in the iron. This process forms what is called pig iron, which is a very high carbon alloy, generally with lots of impurities.  It isn't very useful.  So then, the carbon content needs to be reduced to make steel.  This can be done in various ways, such as melting it and blowing oxygen over it, getting more of the carbon to burn off. \n\nHowever, the ultimate source of the carbon was the coal or charcoal.",

If the metal is native, meaning it was not processed, then a u/pb isotope dating method might be used if the metal was a meteorite or a natural process that was not hydrothermal.\n3.

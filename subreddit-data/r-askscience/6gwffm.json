            "comment": "Electricity has been known for a long time. Egyptians noted the similarity between electric eel shocks and lightning.\n\nPliny the elder (and many others) noted that these shocks could be transferred, that objects when rubbed often attracted things, that so did magnets, and that the three phenomena were connected. Thales of Miletus came up with the theory that when Amber underwent friction, it became a lodestone, and if rubbed further produced lightning proving it was a magnetic force behind lightnng. Both though in terms of \"Gods\" or \"Souls\", which in terms of philosophy might be better thought of as a \"motive force without a clear origin\".\n\nWhich is a pretty solid conclusion if you discount Thales mixed up electric fields and magnetic ones. And, you know, thought everything was water (not as stupid as it sounds.)",

Basic transistors are made of 2 types of silicon that normally don't allow electrical flow, but when switch \"on\" (electricity applied to the middle section) do allow electrical flow. So it's kind of like how a valve normally blocks water in pipes, but we can twist a knob to shift the valve to the allow state.",

We don't really eradicate diseases usually, they'll infect a whole lot of people, the people will become immune, the pathogen will change a little, then bam back again. Thankfully it isn't really evolutionarily advantageous for pathogens to kill their host. Only if they can spread incredibly fast.\n\nOur immune systems can change through evolution but only over a pretty unimaginably long period of time. ",

The difference is that the process is exponentially faster for memes. This explains the information explosion of the past few centuries while remaining genetically static.\n\nThe meme bit is toward the end of the book. It was an interesting (if a bit long) read, be warned it gets highly technical at times, about a wide range of topics.",

If the pressure drops, the capacitor adds water to the plumbing to fight the pressure drop.  If the pressure rises, the capacitor sucks some water in to try to drop the pressure.\n\nSo a capacitor is most like water pressure regulator I guess?

If the pressure drops, the capacitor adds water to the plumbing to fight the pressure drop. If the pressure rises, the capacitor sucks some water in to try to drop the pressure.\n&gt;\n&gt;So a capacitor is most like water pressure regulator I guess? A fancy one that tries to minimize transient pressure changes.\n\nThe analogous device, in terms of this usage, is a water tower - but I think that's mostly how it looks on the outside, and the \"internal\" analogy isn't quite exact.  A water tower converts the pressure into height (i.e. gravitational potential energy) rather than storing high-pressure water directly.  Inside a capacitor, the voltage difference between the plates *does* go up, so it is \"pressurized\".\n\n[edit] Thinking about it again, a water balloon seems to provide the correct internal analogy and (roughly) charge and discharge over time.",

Water towers have a single connection, while capacitors have two.\n\nA hydraulic analogy could be a pair of adjacent ponds, with initially equal water levels, where we \"charge\" the device by scooping a bucket of water out of one pond and dumping it into the second pond.  A better analogy would be a water-filled tank with a rubber membrane dividing the tank into two.  (Or, put two water-balloons in the same solid-wall container, so together they totally fill the space.)   That way the total \"charge\" of water always remains the same inside the device, as occurs with real capacitors.\n\nTo \"charge\" the rubber-divided tank we remove a cc of water from one side, while simultaneously injecting a cc into the other side.  Energy is stored as the rubber membrane stretches.   To \"discharge,\" just connect the two sides together, which produces a momentary current as the rubber relaxes and the two volumes of water equalize.\n",

This can \"store\" a pressure differential (voltage) that acts with a small amount of actual water (amperage). I think a big bucket that tips is misleading because that's a lot of water. Capacitors don't hold near enough charge to act as a huge bucket in the water analogy.\n\nEdit: Also a diaphragm doesn't let water (charge) flow so it's exactly like capacitance in a DC system.\n\nBonus point for explaining inductance with water if anyone wants to try that.",

In a standard RC (Resistor/Capacitor) circuit in DC, the capacitor wouldn't discharge. It would fill up, and the current would stop flowing once it's full. If you hooked up the same circuit to an AC power source, you would see the capacitor filling up *to a point* (the amount would vary depending on the values of the resistor and capacitor, so I won't go into that) and then it would discharge, and refill to the same point, and discharge again, creating a kind of \"smoothed out\" signal like you were describing.\n\nIn audio applications, because the actual frequency of the sound passed to the speaker varies with each millisecond or less (think something chaotic and fast, like Grindcore), you can use an RC circuit as a frequency filter, effectively not allowing audio frequencies in a certain range to pass through, because they're getting \"absorbed\" by the capacitor that's constantly filling and discharging. So you can easily change the values of the resistor and capacitor to match specific frequencies, and split up the same audio source through multiple speakers to make sure you aren't trying to send high power thundering bass through a tweeter, and not wasting a bunch of power trying to force a 10\" sub to properly recreate the sound of a cymbal or hat.",

Voltage is the pressure of that water, how much force it carries. A higher \"voltage\" would be the pressure from a taller water tower, and could push the same amount of water (current) through a narrower pipe (a higher resistance).\n\nSo power being volts times amps, it would be equivalent to the amount of water flowing multiplied by the pressure pushing it. If that water was running a water turbine to generate electricity, then you would get more power by increasing either the amount of water flowing (with bigger pipes, less resistance) or a higher water tower (the water bring pushed faster, even without increasing the size of the pipes).\n\nSo a power generating water dam: high water and big pipes means lots of power (watts) in a very real sense.",

In a mechanical system (such as a mass damper system), the spring is the capacitor, the force applied is the voltage source, a mass would be the inertial element (the inductor), the damper would be the resistor. For a rotational system, the beam is the capacitor, the friction between the bearings is the resistor, any rotating mass would act as an inductor, and the motor (or any force) supplying the torque would be the voltage source.\n\nEverything can be related to an electrical system. Even the way heat travels through objects is modeled by thermal circuitcs where the different materials the heat travels through are resistors with different resistance values (conductivity).",

The plated objects it was believed to have been used for were instead found to have been mercury fire-plated and the design of the inner compartment is almost exactly the same as scroll-holders of the time. It's believed that the slightly acidic residue left inside is due to the organic material (scroll) originally held within that would have decomposed over the years.\n\nIn other words, the Baghdad 'Battery' was actually used to hold scrolls. It wasn't a battery, it was a decorative storage vessel.",

It's powerful and deadly and only gods possess such power. The static electricity had never been believed to be small lightnings, up until the enlightenment age in the 1700s. In fact, if you say you see small lightnings on your finger back then, they would laugh at you silly. You needn't need a time machine to know what static shock is called back then, because even up until today, we have whole tribes who never knew electricity and they just call it pinching if it hurts them or small fire if they see the static discharges on animal furs. Rubbing things is what tribal people do to make fire. They are not surprised, just because touching would give some pain because fire is pain too. In fact, where I live, people continue to call electricity as \"fire\". The ancient egyptians called the electric eels \"angry fish\" and didn't say it shocked them, more like pinching, numbing or biting. It's more about poisonous than electrical. Many plants and animals can give you sharp pain, sharp itch and numbness. Electric eels aren't any more special than a box jellyfish or fire ant or poison ivy.",

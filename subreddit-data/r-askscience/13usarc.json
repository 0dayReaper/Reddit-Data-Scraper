Do spiders have a time of year they\u2019re more bold/active or are there less people going down the trail before me?",

            "comment": "Many spiders will die overwinter, including many orb weaving species (the ones with webs in the air that you describe on the trail). Females will lay a clutch of eggs and the young spiders will disperse in the spring (some through a cool method known as ballooning, where they exude a line of silk and use it to float away in the wind to allow for increased area dispersion) so this inherently will mean a larger amount of spiders in the initial warming months of the year as the young spiders are born and populate the area. It might be you also run in an area that is less traveled, leading to more webs on the trail itself.\n\nSecondly, people notice many more male spiders in the fall months, as males begin to wander in search of mates and are more likely to come in contact with humans, this also is when people tend to see certain species of spider more often.",

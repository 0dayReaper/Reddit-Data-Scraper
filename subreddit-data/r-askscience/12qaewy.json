    "postText": "Hello!\n\nFirst year bio student, just curious about how there seem to be so many zoonotic diseases originating in birds that can spread to humans. There's also a lot originating from other mammals like bats and rats, but that makes sense since humans are relatively closely related to them, and have really similar body systems and tissues. But birds confuse me as a common source of zoonotic diseases. I understand that they're really effective vectors and spreaders of disease, since they can cover so much distance easily and poop often all over the place, but on a biological system level I don't really understand. Birds and humans haven't shared an ancestor since over 200 million years ago, and have significantly different digestive and respiratory systems.   \n\n\nRambling aside, what i'm asking is why are we so compatible with birds in terms of diseases? How do so many diseases infect both birds and humans equally as easily when we're so different? Why do some diseases affect birds and humans, but not other mammals? What do birds and humans have in common that other mammals don't?",

            "comment": "I don't know whether we truly share more disease with birds than with other animals, but I can shed some light into the question of \"compatibility.\"\n\nMost zoonotic diseases are caused by viruses, at least that's what we are familiar with, like influenza or SARS-CoV-2. The factors that allow a virus to \"jump\" from an animal to humans are not so much about anatomical similarity as the cellular similarity at a molecular level. Does the host cell have the right type of receptor for the virus to recognize and attach? Is the host cell membrane amenable to the virus to penetrate and inject its genome?\n\nTake SARS-CoV-2 for example. It uses a receptor called ACE2 that are abundant in human lung cells to attach and infect. While COVID is wreaking havoc in humans, it also has been observed in other animals that have ACE2 receptors.\n\nOnce a virus infects a host cell, the rest is pretty simple and pretty universal in all animals: the host cell's replication machinery begins transcribing and translating the injected viral genome, producing viral proteins. These viral components self-assemble into new viral particles, burst out of the host cell, and infect more cells. What we call \"disease\" is a consequence of the host cell death and activation of immune system.",

While you may have read about/heard about some notable cases, its important to compare the actual numbers to see if there is some unexpected frequency where this occurs.  Its quite possible bird to human (and/or vice versa) are less common than you perceive when you look at the actual numbers, you've just heard of it more.\n\nIf the data supports an actual higher relative frequency of bird/human disease transfer then a number of factors may be involved such as frequency of interaction between the species.  Humans spend much more time closely interacting with birds than most other closely related species such as monkeys or apes for example.  Birds share environments with people world wide, are kept as pets, and eaten as food.  Additionally despite divergence of species the type of agent might infect using vectors that remain common among the two species over time.\n\nBut again that all depends on if there is ACTUALLY a higher frequency of zoonotic disease from birds than expected and its not a perception issue instead.",

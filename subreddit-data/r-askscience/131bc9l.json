However, it's typically imperfect since the moisture will not distribute equally, and also, it's hard to know how much moisture you need. \n\nWith time,  especially in a refrigerator,  statsh recrystalize, which make them stale. This process is reversible by heating them long enough. 10 minutes at 350\u00b0F works well.",

                    "comment": "To add more detail: starch has a crystalline structure, including lots of amylose that are nicely lined up and hydrogen-bonded to one another. This is largely water-insoluble, but heat will help break those hydrogen bonds and force water molecules in between the amylose, at which point we say the starch has been \u201cgelatinized.\u201d This gelatinized starch is much more flexible and free to move around than the rigidly-arranged crystalline form, so you get soft bread.\n\nOnce the heat is gone, however, water molecules start randomly getting kicked back out from in between the amylose, and hydrogen bonds begin re-forming. This is called \u201c[retrogradation](https://youtu.be/uGfSA-ezmEw),\u201d and while the process can take days (and isn\u2019t ever *complete* retrogradation), the re-crystallization makes the bread harder and harder. This is also why a starch-thickened gravy might have a layer of water on top of it after a few days in the fridge\u2026that\u2019s the water that was forced out from in between the amylose.\n\nHeat is the key to gelatinized starch, which is why re-heating bread generally softens it again.",

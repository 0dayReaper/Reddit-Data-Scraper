    "postText": "I read a comment that said that the hormone testosterone is what makes the difference between males and females. So, males having a greater amount of testosterone than females during life and before being born makes their body different than females. And I guess that the user who made the comment (although they didn't explicitly tell it) thought that with the hormone estrogen the same logic applies.\n\nI would like to know if there would be any differences between males and females if they had the same hormones and amount of them. I am aware that the chromosomes would still be different between males and females. But would there be any other physical differences? (strength, height, bones, prostate, face features, hips, breasts etc.) Also, would the genitals be different or the genitals need hormones (in this case hormones before birth) to become different between males and females? (As far as I know, the glans and the clitoris have a common origin, and the scrotus and the labia have a common origin too) \n\nFinally, I am sorry if it sounds strange or weird that I say *\"males\"* and *\"females\"* instead of *\"men\"* and *\"women\"*. I was honestly trying to not be offensive towards transgender people and didn't know what were the rigth words to use.",

            "comment": "Yes. There would be differences. Sex determination in utero does depend on the well known sex hormones estrogen and testosterone, but its started with the presence (or absence) of testis determine factor a gene which codes for anti-mullerian hormone. \n\nThe genetically female person would be infertile and would not develop proper testes due to an absence of anti-mullerian hormone encoded for on the Y chromosome, but would have a penis and underdeveloped uterus. \n\nThe genetically male individual would probably also be infertile due to likely lacking functional ovaries and a fully functional uterus, though there are reports of fertility in 46,XY women.\n\nTldr; Estrogen and testosterone control sexual differentiation at puberty but its more complicated before birth.",

The gene that codes for anti-mullerian hormone is on chromosome 19, but requires the SOX9 transcription factor for activation. SOX9 production is activated in Sertoli cells via the SRY/Testis determining factor protein.",

If all fetuses got the same hormones that inversion would not take place and therefore everyone would be the same yes.  (Other genetics aside) after this inversion the y chromosome becomes dormant.\n\nGoing with the first part of your question. After birth if everyone had the same hormones they would develop in identical ways yes. (Though an indeviduals sensetivity to varous hormones would change the results)",

A genetically male child who is resistant to testosterone will be born with female genitals.\n and can continue developing as a female into adulthood.

Without SRY, they end up as the female follicular cells. Even with exogenous androgen supplementation, these cells would remain as follicular cells and would ultimately attempt to form a female reproductive tract. I can't speak to the effects of androgens/AMH on development of these organs as the embryo grows, but it seemd unlikely they would be typically anatomically male.\n\nFurther Reading: \n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20005972/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20005972/)\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10412367/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10412367/)\n\n[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16046443/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16046443/)",

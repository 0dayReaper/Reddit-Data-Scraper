For example you have memory, sensory inputs, mood, executive override, regulation of body processes and many more parts contributing to the experience of \"emotion\".\n\nExperiencing emotion does not involve just one part of the brain or even just one pathway.\n\nYou could make an extremely reductive and simplistic statement and say that logic is more related to outer structures of the cortices and emotion is more related to inner structures like the limbic system and basal ganglia, but this would be an incredible oversimplification.

But it's a massive leap to then say \"part A is obviously the logic part of the brain\" and \"part B must be the emotional part.\" The brain is intricately interconnected with many different structures that have overlapping functions. \n\n\nThe triune brain model is a simplification based on neuroscience from the 60s. It's a model that's useful for some purposes, but ultimately, at the level of the brain, emotion and cognition are inseparable. The paper below argues the point well. \n\n\nNeuroscientist Antonio Damasio wrote a whole book on the error of dichotomizing emotion and cognition: Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain. \n\n\n\"We argue that emotions are best understood in terms of action readiness (Frijda, 1986, 2007) in the context of the organism\u2019s ongoing skillful engagement with the environment (Rietveld, 2008; Bruineberg and Rietveld, 2014; Kiverstein and Rietveld, 2015, forthcoming). States of action readiness involve the whole living body of the organism, and are elicited by possibilities for action in the environment that matter to the organism. Since emotion and cognition are inseparable processes in the brain it follows that what is true of emotion is also true of cognition. Cognitive processes are likewise processes taking place in the whole living body of an organism as it engages with relevant possibilities for action.\"\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4422034/",

            "comment": "They're not precise scientific terms, but they reflect a general idea of how different aspects of our cognitive processes work. In neuroscience, we tend to talk more about specific brain regions and networks that are involved in these processes rather than using broad terms about the mind.\n\nAlso, the distinction between logic and emotions is not as clear-cut as it may seem. While it's true that some brain areas are more associated with logical thinking (e.g., the frontal lobe) and others with emotions (e.g., the limbic system), these regions do not work in isolation. They are interconnected and constantly communicate with one another, which means that our \"rational\" and \"emotional\" processes are not completely separate.\n\nIn fact, [this review](https://academic.oup.com/bmb/article/84/1/69/381112?login=false) has shown that emotions can play a crucial role in moral decision-making. For example, people with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region important for processing emotions, often struggle with making rational moral judgments and behaviour. This suggests that our emotions help us evaluate the potential outcomes of our choices, which is an essential aspect of logical thinking.\n\nOn the other hand, excessive emotional arousal can interfere with logical thinking, leading to irrational decisions. For instance, when we experience strong emotions like fear or anger, our amygdala becomes more active, which can sometimes override our prefrontal cortex's ability to think rationally. This is why we might make impulsive or irrational decisions when we're emotionally overwhelmed.\n\nAnother example is how the pain experience is processed. When you receive painful stimulation from the outside, specific pain neurones send signals to the Thalamus, which then relay the signals to the somatosensory cortex (for conscious perception), the limbic system (for emotional experiences, such as fear), and the frontal lobe (for [emotional suffering](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK219252/) and decision-making).\n\nTLDR:\n\n* Logical thinking and emotions are not completely separate, as brain regions associated with them are interconnected and communicate with one another.\n* Emotions play a crucial role in moral decision-making, as they help evaluate potential outcomes of choices.\n* The pain experience is built by combining different brain regions involved in conscious perception, emotional experiences, and decision-making.",

There are rational vs emotional processes in the brain, but it's hard to divide them into distinct \"parts\" - though some sections do govern more to one side than the other.\n\nFor example, speaking a foreign language favours the medial part of the frontal cortex that governs utilitarian/rational systems (essentially people diminish abstract thought in favour of speaking the non-native language). As a result, our moral and ethical stances change and become more utilitarian when speaking another language. \n\nPeople will actually respond less emotionally to messages/conversations in a foreign language.\n\nYou can read more about this from some of Mariano Sigman's neuroscience studies.",

Most people think the brain works by the \"Grandma neuron\" theory (Probably because that's how computer hard drives work), which is that there's a specific neuron in your mind that is dedicated to storing and using the concept of your grandma in everyday thinking. However this is not the case and it's much more difficult to wrap one's head around. You can monitor bloodflow and have a rough idea of which area od the brain is important for what sort of activity but I would imagine that it's very difficult to drive a hard line between them with something that is as highly conceptual as logic and emotion.",

Further, you should really clarify that there is neither single spot nor even a few discrete spots that \"light up\" for certain functions. It can be many, all over the brain, and in volumes that resemble the screwy shapes of gerrymandered voting districts. In fact, one recent study showed a large number of regions and spots lighting up for a single function, all over the brain. Basically the brain is like a room full of people cooperating to discuss an idea. Certain questions might elicit answers from certain people in the room, and they will discuss with each other their thoughts, but nobody would feel constrained to label those people as only serving a single function.",

We can use these different functions to learn more about how individuals or groups make choices and why.

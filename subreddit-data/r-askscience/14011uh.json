You are correct in that Rayleigh scattering is the main cause but the extra color is due to the amount of smoke particles in the sky over much of Michigan.",

                            "comment": "Just to tack onto this, the reason smoke makes the sky (or sun, or moon) look red is because of [a different type of scattering called Mie scattering](https://edu.rsc.org/soundbite/why-smoke-particles-turned-the-sky-red/4010543.article). Basically when there's a high enough concentration of smoke particles, the Mie scattering dominates over the Reyleigh scattering, and the sky/sun/moon go red instead.",

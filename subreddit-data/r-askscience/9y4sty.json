The DOD funds a good portion of it (turns out loud explosions and artillery are destroying the hearing of our active troops and vets.)\n\nI'm sure there are many groups working on this, but I know the Tzounopoulos group at the University of Pittsburgh is actively working on a drug to cure/prevent tinnitus. Not my area of expertise so I don't know the specifics of the project, but here is a link to his website. Some of his papers may be interesting to OP and anyone else looking for info. \n\n\n\nhttp://phrc.pitt.edu/people/thanos-tzounopoulos",

            "comment": "Tinnitus is often associated with noise-induced hearing loss, which is in turn caused by damage and death of hair cells in the cochlea. These cells are responsible for sensing vibrations and translating them to nerve signals to be sent to the brain. Once damaged or destroyed they cannot regenerate naturally. However several methods of inducing hair cell regeneration are currently under investigation, see [this review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5534485/).\n\nEDIT: As you can tell from my flair I am not an expert on this topic and I've only done some cursory reading because I have mild tinnitus myself, I won't be able to answer any questions that I'm not familiar with.",

Because of the Meniere's, my tinnitus is broadband noise, rather than a tone or ringing. It sounds similar to sticking one's head out the window of a fast moving car. And the vertigo is absolutely the worst thing I have ever experienced physically.\n\nSeveral commenters below recommend seeing an ENT. Actually, you should seek out an Otolaryngologist. ",

They pick up different frequencies depending on their size (there are a few different sizes of sterocilia) and how they vibrate related to what basal cells and receptors they are rooted to. Signals from these stereocilia are translated to the auditory cranial nerve. \n\nHearing loss occurs when these stereocilia are exposed to frequent loud noises or other disruptions to the inner ear. When these stereocilia cannot move properly, they cannot detect noise and send signals to the auditory nerve. Stem cell treatments are being researched to regenerate these sterocilia and their connections to the auditory nerve.\n\nThe hairs on your head are not living nor cells; they are made of keratin, a rigid protein used in the body for structure. They grow from projections evolutionarily related to plaques and scales on distant mammals. ",

            "comment": "Dinosaurs are of course alive today and have pretty great immune systems. Birds are modern dinosaurs and their immune systems are broadly very similar to mammalian immune systems, and work well.\n\n(If you haven\u2019t been paying attention to paleontology for the past 20 years, you may think that \u201cbirds are modern dinosaurs\u201d is some well-actually technical truth that\u2019s based on a quibble, like \u201cwell actually two sticks and a rock are technically a computer\u201d. No.  In every sense birds *are* dinosaurs. Many dinosaurs would have looked like birds, albeit 20-foot-long birds with fangs, and there\u2019s no reason to believe that modern dinosaur immunity is particularly different from that 100 million years ago.)\n\nBirds, like mammals, have innate and adaptive immune system, with T and B cells in the adaptive response. B cells make antibodies that are very similar to mammalian antibodies, and antibodies are passed on to their offspring for temporary protection just as mammals pass on antibodies in their colostrum. There are a number of minor differences between the average bird and the average mammal, but most of those really are well-actually type differences - just because one class of bird antibodies is called \u201cIgY\u201d to mammalian \u201cIgG\u201d doesn\u2019t make a functional difference. There are as many differences between mammal antibodies as between bird and mammals (see camelid antibodies, for example). \n\nWe can also triangulate. Dinosaurs, mammals, and modern reptiles had common ancestors, so the features that mammals and modern reptiles (and modern dinosaurs) have in common were presumably present in ancient dinosaurs. Again, this includes virtually everything you\u2019d find familiar in an immune system, including interferons an d other cytokines, the same categories of pattern-recognition molecules, the same structures for T and B cell receptors, and so on. Very broadly, immunity hasn\u2019t changed very much since sharks invented T and B cells 400 million years ago. \n\nOf course the vast number of ancient dinosaurs, existing over a hundred million years, must have had variations in their immune system, as we see in the thousands of species of birds and mammals. But essentially, they would be just about the same.",

We have already seen this on effect multiple times in recent history with human plagues - Spanish Flu, Black Plague, and now Covid19 - they start out with high mortality rates, but because high mortality limits transmission they mutate and selector high transmissibility but low lethality.\n\n  \n\n\nThe modern flu that goes around the world every year is a descendant of the original Spanish Flu, and while humans have selected for greater immune response (almost certainly contributing to the prevalence of auto immune diseases) the disease itself has also selected for a low enough lethality that it is tolerated and spread in the community.\n\nVery, very few viruses are significantly lethal in their stable populations, it's only when they jump species that they start being an issue.",

The Spanish flu was so lethal because it was very novel and pre-existing immunity against it was very low. The covid circling the globe isn't a less-lethal strain today, it's just that we are all chock full of antibodies and t cell immunity that recognize various pieces of it and give us a head start on fighting the new variants we encounter.\n\nYou can also see that with rsv mortality. We didn't evolve a more lethal rsv variant during covid, people just went two extra years between exposures and therefore got rip-roaring cases without robust herd immunity when they resumed getting exposed.\n\nAnything hitting a totally naive population is very bad. Not only are you more sensitive to it, all the other highly sensitive people around you are spewing out high viral titers for longer also, thereby giving you a larger dose when you get infected.",

Many infectious diseases become less infectious over time. The pathogen isn't choosing anything. Passaging a virus or bacteria in people is similar to passaging it in vitro. Sometimes the tradeoff in genes (particularly when it is a small genome like most viruses) make it more infectious, sometimes more symptomatic, sometimes it will infect different cell types, sometimes more deadly. Very rarely can something quickly gain higher morbidly or mortality without losing something else key to broad infection (e.g. transmission by water or aerosol). The big killers will be the same until we figure out how to make an efficacious and cheap vaccine. TB, Malaria, HIV, diarrheal diseases, pneumonia. Of those, HIV would be the only \"newish\" agent.

Immunological analysis of bats has shown they\u2019re better at fighting viral infections than most other mammals, in part due to better dna repair pathways and broader antiviral proteins. Their symptoms tend to be milder because of the suppressed inflammatory response, but they also don\u2019t get reinfected by the same viruses as often as we do because of how their immune system works. \n\nMore sources and reading in this review article: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9379578/",

Their temperature ranges are similar to ours so any virus that can live and mutate in them has a better chance of spilling over into us (I think there is a hypothesis that their flying raises their temp like a fever that keeps the viral load down, but still present...which means they don't get sick sick, but they also never get completely better so they can spread it) \n\nCombine that with what you said: their bodies are better at balancing the immune response so it doesn't ever go full tilt and clear the virus. They don't get inflamed. I think that's also believed to be a consequence of flight. They'd just be crippled by inflammation caused by the stresses of flight so their bodies evolved to manage it better.",

With that, their behavior for catching food and swallowing, as compared to stay on ground for tearing and mastication became the trait. Birds developed an extension of the esophagus called \u201ccrop\u201d where all swallowed, not masticated food is deposited. The crop serves as first digester. Just as the mouth of mammals, it contains amylases for hydrolysis of simple fibers and starch. The crop has motion like the stomach bag has. Some birds intentionally consume small rocks for helping the crop breaking the food a bit.",

The earliest immune systems were basically just antimicrobial proteins, and as organisms got more complex so did the mechanisms needed to protect against pathogens. Innate immune cells (which recognize broad classes of pathogens) with simple effector functions came first, then got more complex in how they killed \u201cnon-self\u201d stuff. Eventually, adaptive immunity evolved (about 65 million years ago if I remember correctly) when cells started making receptors that could change from what\u2019s encoded in their genes. This raised the potential for really exquisitely specific and potent responses. So it doesn\u2019t directly answer your question, but in general the more complex the organism the more likely it is to have something we could easily recognize as innate or adaptive immune cells. Plants actually don\u2019t have any mobile immune cells (and so don\u2019t make antibodies), but they can sense viruses etc using receptors on barrier cells just like ours do",

Or are shark \"T and B cells\" different from mammal \"T and B cells\" but we just call them that for convenience due to playing similar roles?",

B and T cells are only in the vertebrate lineage. The common ancestors of sharks and all other vertebrates (but those common ancestors were essentially sharks) invented B and T cells, and all the rest of us fish/reptiles/mammals/dinosaurs/amphibians have kept those inventions. One step back, the common ancestors of sharks and lampreys/hagfish, did not have T and B cells as we understand them (and therefore lampreys and hagfish invented a completely different, but functionally surprisingly similar, immune system). \n\nI went into more detail in previous questions:\n\n* [Do we or can we ever know how our immune system evolved?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/qptk4c/do_we_or_can_we_ever_know_how_our_immune_system/)\n* [Have living things always had an immune system?](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/zf4l29/have_living_things_always_had_an_immune_system/)",

Also atmospheric oxygen levels are about 2/3 of the concentration during the Cretaceous period, and mammalian respiratory systems aren't as efficient at gas exchange, so we don't see many 20ft-long mammals. \n\n&gt;Birds are warm blooded, were the dinosaurs warm blooded?\n\nYes. It's been determined that the dinosaurs could not have maintained the activity levels indicated by the muscular attachment points on their bones, without being warm blooded. Although there may have been exceptions or adaptations like great white sharks that are technically cold-blooded but practically maintain a temp higher than surrounding waters.\n\nedit: a word",

We can and have scientifically defined reptiles, mammals, birds, and amphibians by saying they're all descendants of a single common ancestor. The trouble is if you do this for fish you're basically saying it's equivalent to vertebrate. Personally I think we might as well just consider them equivalent but many scientists are hesitant. So the solution is that while Mammalia, Aves, etc are clades \"fish\" is not one.",

More specifically, humans primates. More specifically, humans are apes. More specifically, humans are hominids.\n\nHuman is a subset of species within all sorts of class and clade above. There used to be several other species of human, but as we're the only ones left, we get the benefit of calling ourselves human and skipping the \"homo sapien\" verbiage.\n\nYes, humans evolved from hominids, from apes, from primates. That doesn't make us not those things. It's actually important to recognize that we *are* those things, within the very definition of what those things are.\n\nBirds are dinosaurs. Yes, every bird alive today is descended from avian dinosaurs. But not a single bird has ceased to fit the taxonomic definition of a \"dinosaur.\" This problem runs deep, too. Any definition you try using to exclude extant birds from the definition of \"dinosaur\" declassifies birds from being birds. It can't be defined by flight; that would exclude hundreds of living species. It can't be defined by when they died off; that's not evolutionarily taxonomic.\n\nThe biggest problem with the whole method is that what we call \"birds\" consists of four distinct lineages that survived the K-T mass extinction. Waterfowl and land fowl are two of them that probably diverged from enantiornithes about 100MM years ago. Ostriches and similar didn't really diverge and are extremely basal. The rest of the general birds we get were likely already very divergent by the extinction event.\n\nSo if you go back to the earliest ancestor of those four lines of bird... It's a dinosaur. An *early* dinosaur. That's the whole thing.\n\nBirds aren't a unit. The four lineages that survived aren't descended from a single line that is definitively \"bird\". They're descended from several generic theropods that aren't even vertically evolved. They're evolved from *different* dinosaurs.\n\nSparrows are closer related to velocirapror than they are cassowaries.\n\nIf you define birds as the descendents of their earliest common ancestor, then you are forced to include many toothed raptors that are clearly not \"birds\".\n\nThe clades converged over time. Teeth were typically lost in the evolutionary chain as they were unnecessary to the kind of food or prey that was abundant. General vegetation was gone, teeth weren't good at the nuts and seeds left behind, so those with beaks won out. Flight was hit or miss from the start. Even claws on wings went away after the extinction event.\n\nBirds cannot be excluded from dinosaurs as descendents because they didn't descend in one even lineage.",

Today's monotremes have significantly lower body temperatures than marsupials and placental mammals.\n\nThis would have made them less susceptible to fungal infections and pathogens adapted to environmental temperatures than cold blooded animals but more prone to them than today's mammals and birds.\n\nBirds get fevers, like mammals, which is probably covergent evolution.  Ectotherms like crocodiles can't raise their own body temperature in response to infection.  Whether any non-avain dinosaurs could is unknown.\n\nOnly a few aquatic birds (geese and swans) have lymph nodes like mammals.  Again, it is almost certainly covergent evolution, although in this case, since most birds don't have them, dinosaurs 65MYA almost certainly did not.\n\nA special lymphic organ called the Bursa of Fabricius is present in gallinaceous birds (landfowl, like chickens and pheasants) near the cloaca as part of the GALT (Gut-Associated Lymphic Tissue).  Some reptiles and even fish have analogous organs so maybe some other dinosaurs would have had something similar.\n\nAlthough some people will tell you that birds don't have bone marrow, they do and it plays a role in their immune system.  However they have less of it due to hollow bones and to an extent the spleen takes up some of the slack.  Hollow boned dinosaurs may have been similar.\n\nApart from that their immune system was probably fairly similar to other land vertebrates and, really, all jawed vertebrates.",

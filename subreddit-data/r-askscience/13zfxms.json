    "postText": "If I took a fan in a inclosed tube with 2 small slits for it to pass through would I get on the end of the tube 2 spots of high turbulence wind or a spread of spots as in the quantum double slit experiment? Basically I want to know if air acts as a particle or wave in this experiment?",

            "comment": "I think you have missed the point of the quantum double slit experiment just a little bit. The whole point of that experiment is that it was proving light can act as both a particle and wave (and so therefore demonstrate both properties) - wind is already confirmed as something which derives from particles. As such it has the behaviour of particles.\n\nThat being said however, because wind will be forced to go through the gap the wind with the path of least resistance - in other words the wind that goes straight through the gap will feel most powerful. So to answer your question, it\u2019s not affected by the experiment but the results you\u2019ll get will be based around the path of least resistance - which may trick you into thinking it\u2019s a wave.",

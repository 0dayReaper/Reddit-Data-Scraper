    "postText": "I have a rather small bathroom, and an even smaller shower with a curtain in front.\n\nWhen I turn on the water, and stand in the shower, the curtain comes towards me, and makes my \"space\" even smaller.\n\nWhy is that, and is there a way to **easily prevent that?**\n\nEDIT: Thank you so much for all the responses.\n\n u/PastelFlamingo150 advised to leave a small space between the wall and the curtain in the sides. I did this, and it worked!\n\nJust took a shower moments ago, leaving a space about the size of my fist on each side. No more wet curtain touching my private parts \"*shrugs*\"\n\nEDIT2: [Also this..](https://media.makeameme.org/created/magnets-od6wi4.jpg)\n\nTL;DR: Airflow, hot water, cold air, airplane, wings - science",

The shower head does generate airflow, but also in a hot shower the warm air goes out over the top, sucking in cold air at floor level, causing the curtain to blow in. \n\nI tried to find it again, but failed. Instead, [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-shower-curta/) is a modern equivalent analysis of the airflow using a finite element simulation - it seems comprehensive enough.\n",

The waterproof liner prevents the chainmail from rusting, and the chainmail layer is heavy enough to resist deflection by puny air currents.",

Cold water can do it some because the air inside the shower gets moved around by the pouring water creating low pressure. The relatively stagnant air outside the shower has a higher pressure and pushes the curtain in.",

Water that feels cold may still be higher than the air temperature, and drive the change mentioned in the parent comment; albeit at a slower rate.\n\nBody temperature is generally warmer than ambient, which is part of the reason why solids (metal utensils, glasses, water, etc, which rest at or around the ambient/air temp) feel cold when you pick them up. These materials transfer more heat from the body, and this change over time is what our bodies detect. \n\nMuch the same reason why a 20\u00b0(68\u00b0F) day is a bit brisk, while a pool of the same temperature feels much colder. It's pulling more heat out of the body than air does, but they're both the same difference from 37\u00b0 (98.6\u00b0F) body temperature.\n\n^(Edit: added alternate units)",

Over the weekend there was a dehumidifier running in my bathroom for 30+ hours nonstop, which raised the air temperature in my bathroom to over 100F degrees. When I took a shower, the water was cooler than the surrounding air and the curtain actually belled OUTWARD, lending credence to the hot/cold air circulation theory.",

With a hot shower you can feel the cold air rushing in at your feet while it's hot and steamy up top. \n\nPlus to help stop the curtain from billowing in you can open the far side of the curtain a little and it'll vent hot air and steam out the side.

Another way to say the above is that the effective volume of one molecule of all ideal gasses is the same. The molecular weight of water is 18. The molecular weight of nitrogen is 28. The molecular weight of oxygen is 32. In humid air the water vapor acts like an ideal gas. So the water vapor displaces some of the oxygen and nitrogen, occupies the same volume as the air displaced but weighs less, so the density of the sample is lower than when the air was dry.",

In a shower, the primary fluid is water and the secondary fluid is air inside the shower, which convects around the flow of the spray. This causes a situation where the air inside the shower is moving faster than the air outside and here the Bernoulli principle takes hold: faster moving air has a lower relative air pressure. Suddenly, the higher air pressure outside is pushing the curtain in, similar to the way the higher pressure of slower air under a wing pushes it up.\n\nThis compounds the effect of the hot air rising out the top of the curtain and creating a chimney effect in the shower.\n\nTo see a simple demonstration of this effect, just get a drinking straw and a strip of paper. Hold the paper vertically in one hand and blow air on one side, and watch as the paper shifts towards the stream of air!",

                            "comment": "I'm not sure the Bernoulli principle is applicable here as it is only valid along a streamline. If I recall correctly, all it states is that for air to speed up there must be a negative pressure gradient along the streamline in the direction of the flow, which is disarmingly intuitive when you think about it. However, taking the example of the straw and paper, the air sources for the top and bottom of the sheet of paper are completely separate - the former starts in your lungs and the latter is ambient air. Therefore, the streamlines are disconnected and Bernoulli's doesn't hold. \n\nI can't actually remember why the paper is seen to deflect towards the moving airstream though as it's been a while since I read up on this, so I'm happy to be corrected if it turns out I'm wrong.  \n\nEdit: Found my source. It's from a short paper called \"How Wings Work\" by Holger Babinsky, Professor of Aerodynamics at Cambridge University:\n\n&gt;However, the fact is often overlooked that\rBernoulli\u2019s equation applies ONLY along a stream-line. There is no explicit relationship between the\r\npressure and velocity of neighbouring streamlines.\rSometimes, all streamlines in a flow originate\r\nfrom a region where there is uniform velocity\rand pressure (such as a reservoir or a uniform\rfree-stream) and in such a case it is possible to\r\napply Bernoulli\u2019s equation throughout the flow.\rBut in the \u2018demonstration\u2019 of Bernoulli\u2019s equation\rshown in figure 2 the air moving along the upper surface of the paper originates from the mouth\rof the person performing the experiment and thstreamlines can be traced right back into this\r\nperson\u2019s lungs. There is no connection with the \u2018streamlines\u2019 underneath the paper and Bernoulli's equation cannot be applied to compare the pressure\r\nin the two regions. In fact, the pressure in the\rair blown out of the lungs is equal to that of the surrounding air (and this is proved when blowing\rover a straight sheet of paper\u2014it doesn\u2019t deflect towards the moving air).

What you should be doing is taking a shower soap bottle (shampoo, body wash, etc) and placing it at the corners to pin the curtain in place.  Or, its a bit more expensive but they make basically faux shower curtains (same size but made of lightweight fabric) to put on the outside,  Throw one of those in place and it creates a sort of insulation zone in the middle and the blowthrough is greatly reduced.",

In the eye, the air gradually increases in heat as it rises, pulling cooler air from the ocean surface and constantly \"fuelling\" itself with more moisture. This is what creates the circular air motion of a hurricane. Air is forced to the top because of the lack of pressure in the eye until it is pushed out the top in both directions, creating a spinning motion.

But the reason for my comment is your second point: *how to prevent it*.\n\nOne thing is to get weights or in the case of a metallic bathtub magnets and place them on the sides of the tub with the curtain between the surface and the magnet. This will reduce the effect, especially if you can get them at both corners and the middle rim of the tub as well.\n\nSome shower curtains have these weights/magnets [built in](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CkxSQJRO1AY/U7qDB9CTG7I/AAAAAAAABnU/sm6bhCGZVZ8/s1600/magnetic+shower+curtain+has+magnets+embedded.jpg), while others have [suction cups](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9cfUx4t_Zt4/VLHE4bXr3wI/AAAAAAAACJI/Y8GTzf0naAU/s1600/heavy-weights-for-shower-curtain-bottom.jpg) at the bottom. Alternatively you can also buy kits that allow you alter your current curtain with [hook and latch](https://ourhumbleabodeblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/master-bathroom-shower-curtain-hooks.jpg?w=399&amp;h=600) anchors.",

Vapor is significantly lighter than air and flows upwards. This effect can be observed with cold water as well. The effect with hot water is bigger because hot water has more energy so more water can evaporate.\n\nlinking my topcomment for visibility: https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6cmj7m/why_does_my_shower_curtain_seem_to_gravitate/dhw81pr/",

In short, the main reason is [Bernoulli's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli's_principle), which states that an increase in flow rate of a fluid corresponds with a decrease in pressure. The water flowing on the inside of the shower causes the air to flow, as both are fluids. This decreases the pressure inside the shower curtain relative to the outside, which contains still air. Thus, the pressure is greater outside the curtain than inside, causing it to move inward. This works for water at any temperature, but the effect is amplified at higher temperatures because the hot air moves upward allowing cold are to enter from the bottom, where the curtain is able to move freely.",

This helps block much of the problem already, as it buffers the inner liner. Moreover, if the exterior curtain is long enough that a substantial portion hugs the exterior of the tub, then it is more resistant to being pushed in against the liner as well. \n\nOr, perhaps, when the inner liner gets \"sucked\" into the lower air pressure around the turbulent water flow, it lowers the pressure in the \"pocket\" of air between the liner and the outer curtain. Perhaps this counters or resists the pull of the lower pressure in the shower, keeping the liner for billowing inward.\n\nEither way, any shower that I've used that has both a liner and outer curtain have been resistant to the inward blowing curtain effect.\n\n",

But the question is why?   \n\nTo answer that first let's understand what is pressure. Before the shower is on, air particles are moving randomly in all the directions and hitting the shower curtain. This is what creates the feeling of pressure. Air molecules moving around randomly in all directions, but the net speed is zero because velocities cancel each other out. On the other side of shower curtain, air particles are hitting the shower curtain too at the same rate and thus there is no movement.   \n\nWhen you switch on the shower, the momentum imparted by water molecules to the air particles, making them move in a particular direction(the direction of water stream). Thus, on the shower side there is net velocity of air particles in the direction of water stream. They aren't hitting the curtain as frequently or with as much momentum as before. But on the other side of the curtain, nothing has changed. The air particles are hitting the curtain same as before on the side where there is no shower. Hence this creates a difference in force on the curtain. Outer side has more pressure, and thus more force. This makes the curtain move towards the person taking the shower.",

Fluids with less density rise.\n\nIn the case of the shower, the heat makes the air inside the shower less dense.  In some materials and sometimes only at certain temperatures, the opposite is true.  As you cool water, for instance, it becomes more and more dense until right around 34 degrees Fahrenheit, if I recall correct.  At around 34 degrees, the water starts becoming less dense as you cool it, causing it to stay on top rather than convect to the bottom.  This is an uncommon phenomenon which doesn't happen in many fluids, and it is the reason why water freezes from the top down rather than the bottom up.\n\nSo basically, the solution to the curtain problem is to take showers with near freezing water.",

            "comment": "It's because turning on the shower causes a pressure differential between the inside and the outside of your stand in shower enclosure. Why? In short, Bernoulli principle, that we'll state, for the purposes of this post as: for a fluid in a closed system the sum of the potential energy (topographic and pressure) and kinetic energy (flow velocity) is constant. \n\nYour bathroom is a closed system, for all practical purposes. Before you turn on the shower, there's no air movement so the air only has potential energy; it being at the same elevation means that the pressure is the same everywhere, so no pressure differential. When you turn the shower on you have a couple of effects like 1) the air and water coming from the shower displacing (moving --&gt; velocity) the air inside the stand in shower, 2) the water temperature and your own evapotranspiration changing the temperature of the immediately surrounding air, causing density flows (hot air to rise, cool air to sink --&gt; movement --&gt;velocity), 3) hot air expands, reducing its density and, as such, its potential energy (this is implicitly included in the previous point but I figured I'd spell it out). This means that because now there's a kinetic energy component at play inside the stand in shower, pressure must drop. Pressure outside the shower stays the same, which means a pressure gradient from outside to inside is created. This causes air flow into the shower, that is caught by the shower curtain like a sail. More specifically, it causes cool air at the bottom to try to enter as hot air leaves from the top. That's the effect you see. \n\nHow to prevent that? I've had good results with fabric curtains that let some ir through, become heavy as they soak up the water and dry quickly afterwards. Generally speaking, your two options are to let air in and to make the curtain stiff and heavy. Weights and magnets help, as well as keeping the sides of the curtains open and doubling up on the curtains with one outside and one inside (and it looks nicer IMO). \n\nAnyway, good luck. ",

The cold air outside the shower is more dense and sits lower while the warm or hot air inside the shower push the air up and out. The key to this is to stick your foot under the curtain as it opens up and you'll feel a cold breeze.\n\nSince the curtain is inside the shower and presumably fully drawn across this allows air exchange in only one allowable direction. As the cold air rushes in to equalize the temperature and pressure differential it pushes the lightweight shower curtain towards you.\n\nTo solve this either get a secondary curtain for the outside or allow part of the curtain to be left open to create a different flow.\n\nSource: used to own one.

Everyone is mentioning Bernoulli's principle, but I didn't see any comments explaining exactly why does increase in velocity of air particles leads to decrease in pressure.   \n\nTo answer that first let's understand what is pressure. Before the shower is on, air particles are moving randomly in all the directions and hitting the shower curtain. This is what creates the feeling of pressure. Air molecules moving around randomly in all directions, but the net speed is zero because velocities cancel each other out. On the other side of shower curtain, air particles are hitting the shower curtain too at the same rate and thus there is no movement.  \n\nWhen you switch on the shower, the momentum imparted by water molecules to the air particles, making them move in a particular direction(the direction of water stream). Thus, on the shower side there is net velocity of air particles in the direction of water stream. They aren't hitting the curtain as frequently or with as much momentum as before. But on the other side of the curtain, nothing has changed. The air particles are hitting the curtain same as before on the side where there is no shower. Hence this creates a difference in force on the curtain. Outer side has more pressure, and thus more force. This makes the curtain move towards the person taking the shower.\n\n",

The shower head does generate airflow, but also in a hot shower the warm air goes out over the top, sucking in cold air at floor level, causing the curtain to blow in.\nI tried to find it again, but failed. Instead, here is a modern equivalent analysis of the airflow using a finite element simulation - it seems comprehensive enough.",

            "comment": "Mechanical engineer here.\n\nThe pressure of all fluids drop as their velocity increases. (This is a result of the first law of thermodynamics called conservation of energy.) In the case of your shower, the flowing water molecules from the shower head move the air molecules next to them, giving them a positive velocity. This creates an area of low pressure. The other side of the shower curtain is at \"normal\" (higher relative) pressure. The curtain sees higher pressure on the outside and lower pressure on the inside. This causes the curtain to move toward the area of low pressure.\n\nIt's called the Bernoulli effect. It's the same reason airplane wings create lift. In the case of wings, the top surface of the wing is curved which causes the air to move faster over it than along the bottom. So low pressure above the wing, higher pressure below it. Therefore, it creates lift.\n\nSame thing happens when you open a window in a moving car. If you have balloons inside the car, they are drawn to the open window because the velocity of the outside air creates low pressure outside the window relative to the higher pressure inside the car.",

They prevent your curtain from getting wet and coming in contact with shower spray and residue -- primary shower curtain will stay cleaner and last longer\n\n4.

The waterdroplets partly evaporate while traveling down inside the shower (high surface area since there are a lot of small droplets helps the evaporation which is why it also works with cold water). That watervapor is significantly lighter than hot or cold air and creates an upwards flow. Because of the bigger difference in density (compared to just hot and cold air) the flow of that speed is higher than if you just had hot or cold air. That speed reduces the pressure inside the shower (see bernoulli) which causes the shower curtain to move inwards. Since warm water has more energy more water will evaporate and the flow will be faster, that is the reason why warm water works better.\n\nsource: engineer with specialisation in thermofluiddynamics.",

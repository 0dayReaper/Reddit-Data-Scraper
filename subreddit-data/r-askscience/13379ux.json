    "postText": "Crude oil is the result of millions of years of things dying, so oil reserves happen naturally. We've all seen what happens when it leaks, and we're appalled and horrified, but it seems to me that if some catastrophe or natural disaster like a fissure broke into one of these oil pockets it'd do just as much damage. I find it very hard to believe that this has never happened at least once. \n\nSo, to the earth science people, is what are these classified as? To the biologists, does nature have a way of dealing with this scenario?",

            "comment": "Petroleum can leak out of the ground naturally. The le brea tar pits have been around for like 50,000 years. They are full of skeletons of animals that died from getting stuck in the tar. There are micro organisms capable of breaking down oil. I would imagine sun light and weather will also deteriorate it. \n\nOne of the problem with man made oil spills is that they bring much more petroleum to the surface very quickly. The oil is still full of toxic volatile chemicals that would be dispersed slowly over a long period of time from natural seepage.  The oil we drill for is also deep under ground, where it is under high pressure. If a well is breached, it will spray out an amount of oil that couldn't naturally get to the surface like that.",

The quake fractured into underlying deposits which began to seep up as they were squeezed.\n\nSylmar is up there with Bhopal for mandatory disaster reading material.",

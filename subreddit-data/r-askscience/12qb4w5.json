Up to these distances, they are more or less in the orbital plane of the Sun.\n\nComets come from the very distant Oort cloud (5000 to 50,000 astronomical units away), which at that point aren't necessarily constrained to the orbital plane of the sun and can come in from all directions.",

Comet has a coma precisely because it spends most of it's life far away from Sun and only comes close to it rarely. Heat from the sun vaporizes volatiles, which boil off producing a tail of gas and dust - making the comet into comet. That's a finite resource, if the same rock spends most of it's life close to Sun it quickly dries up and stops being a comet. If the same rock spends all of it's life far from Sun, it's just an icy asteroid far away.",

    "postText": "Hi, first-time visitor here. What is the average size of a human heart four months after birth? I've found answers for newborn (a walnut) and a child (one clenched fist) but I haven't found a chart for that specific age. I'm researching for a short film about a child organ donation and wanted to have a size comparison for the audience, e.g. a pomegranate or a tennis ball. My apologies if this has been asked before, my Google-fu isn't as strong as I'd hoped.\n\nThank you very much! \ud83e\udec0",

The surgeon said a fair estimate is the size of your heart is about the size of your clenched fist. He said this is more or less true for all people.  I closed my hand around my babies hand and folded it into a fist. I thought wow, you are going to fix broken bits inside something so small.",

            "comment": "You can use the rule of thumb that a human heart is ~0.5% of the total body mass. I can't really find a good food example of that size, but the average 4 month old weighs roughly 7 kg, which would make the heart around 35g - a bit smaller than a golf ball-ish in size; or maybe a dried apricot; or half an egg.",

    "postText": "So I'm doing research on unicorns for a mythological creatures project I have. The site I have been using listen narwhals as a horned animal, even though their horn is just an overgrown tooth. I looked around and saw that many sites count their tooth as a horn, but I thought horns were pieces of bone connected primarily to the skull of the animal? I know teeth are like that but it feels like theres a difference since horns (as far as I know) aren't used for hunting as much and are more for physical prowess. So does the narwhal count as an animal with a horn despite this?",

            "comment": "It's a \"tusk\".\n\nSo, I think whether you can include it as a horn really depends on your perspective.\n\nDo elephants have horns? They use them when fighting rivals or enemies. In that way their tusks act as horns. Walruses seem to be the same, though, in their case they act like long teeth.\n\nI think you should understand the definitions or \"tusks\" and \"horns\" first. Then understand how narwhals use their tusks. With some creativity, you'll be able to argue they are exactly what you want them to be. It's probably nebulous enough that, with the right argument, no one can perfectly say you're wrong haha.",

So by that definition, a narwhal tusk is certainly not a horn.\n\nI suspect the confusion is because, centuries ago, people mistook narwhal tusks for the horn of the mythical unicorn, and people still often think of a narwhal tusk in that context (or bring that anecdote up when talking about narwhals.) So it makes sense that a prose writer might confuse the two terms.",

Keratin is a protein made by our body, whereas teeth are more like bones and consist out of minerals, primarily calcium and phosphate.",

Zoologists define \"horn\" narrowly such that the horn-like features on many animals such as rhinos, horned lizards, and deer are not technically horns. Lay sources, and even some scientific sources, will use the word more broadly.",

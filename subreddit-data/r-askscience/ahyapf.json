Check it out, if you're interested.\n\nCheers.",

If you could travel arbitrarily close to light speed, you would experience the journey as effectively instantaneous.)\n\nHere's a calculator for it: http://www.emc2-explained.info/Dilation-Calc/\n\nAt .999c (99.9% light speed) it calculates that time is slowed down to 4.47% of the outside value. That means four years are experienced as approximately 65 days.\n\nEdit: fixed the wording. This is literally the time that passes for the ship. It affects everything, from atomic clocks to metabolisms to brain activity.",

From the perspective of passengers on that ship, crossing four light years in 65 days significantly surpasses the speed of light (yes, I understand that from a \"neutral\" vantage point the trip still takes four years). Does that mean that, for those on the ship, since their maximum velocity is still *c*, the distance traveled is compressed? ",

Because at their typical velocity the distance contracts enough to let them make the trip before they decay.",

I think I'll just have to accept the answer until I have more time to understand and read about it, lol. My thought was that the mechanics of the clocks would be ticking time away at the exact same rate since they were programmed the same. And even though the ship is going very fast the clock would still continue to  tick at it's programmed rate.  \n\nI believe you. I just don't understand it.

The clock on the ship would tick at the same rate as the clock on Earth. The literal amount of time elapsed on the spacecraft would be **less** than the amount of time elapsed on earth AND the distance they traveled will have necessarily been much shorter. It's not as if the people aboard the ship would have their time move slower than those on Earth, they just experience less of it because there was actually less time to experience, though as u/riskybusinesscdc points out, from the reference frame of the people on Earth, if they could see the clock on the ship, it would appear to be ticking slower to them.\n\nedit: The distance traveled and time elapsed are the same function.

If you had the technology to travel arbitrarily close to the speed of light you could time travel forwards essentially as fast as you want.  Energy required approaches infinity as you approach the speed of light though, so getting that close becomes extremely difficult.\n\nIn practice there is all the time spent accelerating from your initial reference frame so it's not all spent that fast.

You count ten seconds and sure enough the light reaches you, but I\u2019m long gone.  You keep counting and upon reaching 20 the light reaches me.  I come back and say \u201chaha sure enough he was right, it only took 10 seconds\u201d\n\nThe explanation is that even though I was traveling away at half the speed of light and you were stationary, I could make an equal argument that I was stationary and you and Einstein were moving away from me at half the speed of light, with it reaching me at 10 seconds and reaching you after only 5 seconds.\n\nLight does not work like a thrown baseball where a pitcher with a 100 mile an hour fast ball can stand on a train and throw the ball 200 miles an hour.  No matter how fast the flashlight is moving, once light leaves the flash light it\u2019s traveling away from the flashlight at the speed of light (at least from the flashlights perspective).\n\nSo if you were traveling at 99.9% the speed of light and switched on a flashlight, you would NOT see the light slowly emitting from the flashlight like molasses.  From your perspective it would cross the room in an instant, but from a \u201cstationary\u201d persons perspective it may have taken several seconds for the light to reach the far wall.\n\nCurrently \u201ctime dilation\u201d is an accepted fix to this paradox, and much of physics would not work if this was not true, but it may also be that our understanding of distance and light need to be totally reworked.",

The closer you get to 100%, ie. add more 9\u2019s to the end of your percentage, the faster the trip would feel to the occupants. Here\u2019s a cool calculator site you can play with to see these effects. http://www.emc2-explained.info/Dilation-Calc/#.XESiMRZlCEc\n\n-edit This seems to be a frequent question and it\u2019s a good one. How would you age? The traveler would age relative to the time they experience. So on this trip while everyone on earth experienced 4 years, you\u2019d only age a few months! Take a long enough trip and you might just outlive your own grandchildren!\n\n\n-edit2 Time dilation has been proven experimentally using very precise measurements. Here's a link to an article for some further reading. https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/einsteins-time-dilation-prediction-verified/\n\nAlso, as some have pointed out, it would take a long time to accelerate to these speeds at 1g and would require a HUGE amount of energy to do so. Definitely not practical with current propulsion technologies. I have heard that large solar sails might be able to accelerate small probes to high speeds 20-30% c which would be a cool thing to see. \n\n-edit3 For those curious about the solar sail probe, if you google StarShot you\u2019ll find a lot of info about it. https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/3\n\n-edit4 As many have pointed out, time dilation is a direct result of the length contraction observed by the traveling body. Also, thanks for for the gifts kind strangers.\n\n-edit5 Another fun link thanks to /u/konstantinua00 talking about relativistic effects on mission duration http://convertalot.com/relativistic_star_ship_calculator.html",

Help me understand how another object that needs 4 years to travel said distance at light speed would have occupants in it that beleive it is only .17 years, when in fact the object took 4 earth years to get to its destination.",

From the point of view of the light, its arriving instantaneously. Same goes for the craft, its traveling and only requires .17 years, but from our static view on earth it would appear the craft traveled for a little over 4 years.",

So are you saying that if the craft were traveling at the speed of light then it would arrive, as far as the occupants are concerned, instantaneously? But for us it would appear to take them 4 years?\n\nWould that not mean then that we could travel anywhere instantaneously if we could reach the speed of light from the perspective of the occupants of a craft?\n\nOr are you defining this from the perspective of an observer on Earth?\n\nI'm thinking about the whole Einstein clock scenario, whereby a traveler leaves earth at 12:00:00, travels at the speed of light for 1 second away from earth and then looks at the clock. It will still say 12:00:00 but in actual fact the travelers have traveled for 1 second in my head and to an observer on Earth the clock will say 12:00:01.\n\nSo I get that if they were to travel 4 years away instead of 1 second that, looking back at the clock it will still say 12:00:00 on the date 4 years earlier, but the occupants have still been traveling for 4 years haven't they despite the clock saying this? It's only people on Earth who would see the clock as 12:00:00 but on a date 4 years after the launch.\n",

The gist of it is that as objects with mass travel faster, they get heavier. At light speed, they would have an infinite amount of mass, which would require an infinite amount of energy to accelerate. ",

Don't worry about observers and clocks and all that.\n\nYou get on a ship that takes a second to get to Alpha Centauri.  You turn around and come back to Earth, it takes a second to return.\n\nWhen you get back, it's 8 years later.  You traveled 8 years, it's just you traveled 8 years in space while they traveled 8 years in time.  The more you move in space, the less you move in time. Now it gets all funny and relative, but that's essentially the crux of it. \n\nNow, if you traveled to alpha centauri in a second, and then another shuttle with your twin brother came to alpha centauri in a second, they would be the same age as you, as long as they took the same route.  If they took the scenic route, they would show up younger than you. \n\nWorrying about what others might \"see\" is harder because that adds in light delay in the propagation of information.  It's easier to consider the results of when things are brought back close together. ",

Because the light that's carrying the signal is traveling at almost the same speed you are, and when you get there, you're 4 lightyears away, so of course you're seeing the light from four years ago when you look back at them. Now, on the way back, you're traveling against the light. So you'd see the four years that had passed on your way out and the additional four years it takes to travel back all compressed down into that second, until poof, you're back and it's been 8 years.

This method is never used in actual physics teaching nowadays, but it seems to have persisted in popular science and other material intended for the layperson.\n\nThe more correct way of thinking about mass in relativity is that there are two things: the *invariant mass*, which is the mass you measure (really, the total energy, since there is an equivalence between energy and mass) of something that's stationary with respect to you. If the object is instead moving, it has some kinetic energy as well as the energy due to its invariant mass, which add to give the total energy.\n\n\"Relativistic mass\" comes about if you abuse mass-energy equivalence and call that total energy the mass. This is dubious for all sorts of reasons: it breaks momentum conservation in subtle ways, as well as implying strange statements like multiple observers disagreeing on the mass of an object depending on their orientation with respect to the object's direction of motion.",

You **define** the energy of any isolated, moving body by E = m_rel * c^2, by analogy with Einstein's famous equation for an object in its rest frame. And to make this relationship hold, you have to think of the relativistic mass as a mass that changes as your speed increases.\n\nThis seemed reasonable at the time, because it collapsed into a single idea the two separate 'masses' that Einstein and Lorentz used in their calculations, the 'transverse mass' and the 'longitudinal mass.' It also lets you still define momentum by p = m_rel v, and force by F = dp/dt. This keeps the form of all the equations for special relativity identical to the ones used for classical physics. \n\nHowever, as Special Relativity became more widely accepted, the thinking among physicists shifted. Rather than turning Special Relativity into a theory of 3-vectors in Euclidian space, so that it looks like classical physics, we've decided that we should take Special Relativity seriously on its own terms. Namely, we should take seriously that this is a theory of so-called 4-vectors in Minkowski space. Once you do that, there's no need for any of this 'longitudinal' and 'transverse' mass, there's no need for 'relativistic mass,' and the definitions of momentum, force, etc. **should** be different. This leads to another definition of the energy of a moving object that you've probably seen E = m c^2 + p^2 c^4, where the mass is just the ordinary rest mass, and the extra contribution due to motion clearly comes from the momentum.",

Most likely, you would spend half the trip accelerating and the next half decelerating. \n",

To reach 0.97c @ 1g acceleration would take the *ship* two years, and it would have gone 2.9 light years. Remember that Alpha Centauri is 4ly away, so you would actually want to start decelerating when you have traveled 2ly. You could either have a set of engines opposing the acceleration engines or you could make the spacecraft tumble 180\u00b0 and begin boosting in the opposite direction. \n\n1g is the most desirable acceleration for *human* spacecraft because the journey will take a long time, and people are acclimated to 1g. You could boost more - 1.5g shouldn't be too much for people who are in good physical condition. Your average 150lb adult would \"weigh* 225lbs, which isn't overly stressful on their body. And, if your destination planet has a gravity field greater than Earth's, you could spend the voyage acclimating the passengers to the gravity of the planet they'll be settling.\n\nFor a *robotic* spaceship, the acceleration limits are loads greater. A robot can be built to withstand thousands of g forces. The biggest issue is fuel. You need so much fuel to be constantly boosting during your journey that it becomes exceptionally impractical to build such a device.",

To those individuals at Alpha Centauri, they experience the full 4 year delay the same as us, since they are no longer moving at a speed near the speed of light.  The intense time dilation only occurs when moving at such speed.  *So, in fact, the photons of light that we would have hypothetically used to communicate to Alpha Centauri through radio waves would experience the 0.17 years during their travel from Earth to Alpha Centauri, too (this is also cool af because this time dilation of a photon\u2019s age happens literally all the time, since they often travel at the speed of light).*  Note: the italicized font is incorrect information!  Check out my edit at the bottom of this comment.\n\nThose travelling at 99% the speed of light would have only aged 0.17 years opposed to those on Earth, who would have aged 4 years in the same amount of time.  That\u2019s because the literal spacetime surrounding the space-travellers gets warped, almost like a stretched piece of fabric, literally making the rate that time passes (not just their perception of time) change for them.\n\nIf they return to Earth, you\u2019re totally right, their lifespan would indeed have an extra 7-ish years relative to Earth-time, but to them, it would just be a normal lifespan since they only experienced 0.34 years on their travel there and their travel back.\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve realized a part of this is wrong: if you are moving at the speed of light, as per a photon, time doesn\u2019t just slow down, it stops moving altogether.  Photons experience literally no time passage from the moment they are produced to the moment they are absorbed.",

So let's pretend the speed of light is 100 mph, if you're in a car going 50 mph relative to a bystander then you turn on the headlights, you will see the beam zoom away from you at 100 mph, relative to you. But the bystander will *also* see the beam of light shoot by at 100 mph relative to them, but since you're already moving 50 mph the beam will appear to them to only be going 50 mph faster than you. To you, the beam is going 100 mph faster than you, to the bystander the beam is going 50 mph faster than you. Now a bunch of weird shit has to happen to compensate for the fact that you two disagree about how fast the light beam is moving which I won't get into, but the main takeaway is that no matter how fast you are moving, light will always move at the speed of light relative to you. It doesn't matter if you're going 99.99999999999% the speed of light, if you turn on the headlights it will zoom away from you at the speed of light.\n\nOne important thing to also remember is that *you never move*, you are always stationary in your reference frame. If you are on a train moving across the countryside, then from your perspective it is not you that's moving, it's the countryside that's moving and you're sitting still.",

Put another way, at 99.99% speed of light, for the people aboard the ship, 4 earth years equals about 2 earth months. \n\nIf you think about it, it's just a matter of perspective. From the perspective of people aboard the ship, they only experience 2 months when someone on earth experiences two years. \n\nTraveling at exactly the speed of light (c), this drops to zero, because light experiences zero time (according to Einstein's theory, which, at speeds lower than c, has been pretty much proven. We still don't know exactly what happens at c, but the theory says time stops).\n\nSo if someone were to be propelled at the speed of light, theoretically, they can instantly reach any part of the universe, to them, it would feel like teleportation. However, to someone on Earth, it could take tens of thousands of years and more, depending on how far they have traveled. \n\nThe thing is, matter cannot withstand these speeds, and will disintegrate completely. The only matter particle seen to **almost** travel at the speed of light are neutrinos, but they are nearly massless.   \n\n\nIf you look at quantum physics, though, there seems to be some information travel that is instantaneous (faster than light). Electron pairing - no matter how separated they are, if you spin one the other instantly spins, so there is information travelling between them instantly. \n\nBut if you go down that road, you'd realize we humans really don't understand much at all about the observable universe. We only do our best to explain things from our extremely limited perspective. ",

For a speed of .999c, we get a Lorentz factor of 22.37\n  \nThis means that for every 22.37 years in the reference frame of Earth, one year occurs in the reference frame of the spaceship.  \n\nThis is not a mere illusion or change in how time is experienced, but an actual dilation of space-time.  Relative velocity causes dilation in spacetime, leading to many counter intuitive phenomena.

However, we can change this a bit to give a good example of time dilation.\n\nLets say you had a life support system onboard that used 1M joules of energy each year.  Someone watching on earth would observe that it took you 4 years to reach Alpha Centauri.  However, a proper observer on the spaceship would only observe 0.179 years, and the life support system would use only 0.179M joules.\n\nP.S.  'proper observation' refers to measurements made in a frame of reference that is stationary relative to the object being measured.  The 4 years measured by the observer on earth isn't wrong, in the reference frame of earth it would be accurate to say that the trip took 4 years.  Measurements of elapsed time require a point of reference just as measurements of velocity and speed do.",

The main character is on a \"torchship\" headed first for alpha centauri and the trip only takes 8 or 9 months for the people on board, whereas to the outside observer on Earth it's been closer to a decade or so. \n\nAnother plot point is the fact that the character is a twin and has a psychic link to his twin back on Earth. Thus allowing them to communicate in real time even when traditional communications would break down at such speeds. His brother grows older and they eventually lose their link because they change too much as people. ",

I highly recommend it, and I think it won an award or two.

Once a muon is created it doesn't exist for very long (about 1 millionth of a second) before it decays into something else.\n\nThe Sun ejects many muons traveling at speeds very close to the speed of light, however the Sun is 8 light-minutes away so of course they'd have probably all decayed before they reached Earth right? Well it turns out that many muons _do_ reach Earth! And this is a direct consequence of their time being stretched out (from our perspective) because of their high speed. [1]\n\nI think your question about the photoelectric effect is resolved once you consider electrons do have mass (9.1*10^-31 Kg).\n\n[1] http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Relativ/muon.html",

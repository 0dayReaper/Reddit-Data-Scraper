Canines in general seem to be very adaptable to a wide range of environmental pressures, including selective breeding from humans.  The famous domestication study with Russian foxes further exemplifies this.  Most animals are nowhere near as plastic, including domesticated cats.  \n\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic\\_plasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_plasticity)   \n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0611-6](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-018-0611-6)",

Most plants and animals will respond very dramatically to selective breeding. In fact, the fox study you mentioned is commonly discussed as an example of a much broader pattern in the way selection affects a whole suite of traits together through developmental patterning, rather than something specific to canines.",

Dogs, in contrast, have generally been kept kenneled up and it\u2019s been possible to breed them to specific standards. \n\nAlso, \u201cThe Nocturnal Rambling Habits\u201d would be a great name for a band.",

Their ability to pay attention and other cognitive bits and pieces are much different and as a result so are their desires as well as ultimately their motivations. They're each adapted to very different environmental niches and lifestyles. I think part of the issue in training is that people generally don't get cats like they do dogs. I would guess that it's because people are generally much more similar to dogs cognitively.",

It was in a larger article addressing why cats don't generally come when called.  \n\nDogs were selectively bred to do the things we want them to, and most of those things require they come when we call them.  Whether retrieving prey, following a trail, or coming inside to guard us while we sleep.\n\nWe never really 'bred' cats.  They sort of followed us around where we went because it was convenient for them, and large settlements attracted lots of vermin.  We allowed the cats to co-exist because they were beneficial just by being around, with few downsides.  They'd eat rats, but wouldn't touch grain, for example.\n\nI am curious about their interactions with things like chickens.  I've  seen a lot of 'barn cats' over the years, even on farms with poultry.  Maybe someone with more experience with that can elaborate on it.",

Maybe someone with more experience with that can elaborate on it.\n\nI have some experience with this. Most barn cats won't bother fully grown chickens or other poultry (especially bigger domestic birds like turkeys and geese, which can be aggressive as hell at the best of times). They may well go after chicks, although a sufficiently protective mama hen will serve as a deterrent. Faced with a screeching, flapping hen, most cats will decide that a fluffy little chicken nugget is more trouble than it's worth. Feral cats are more likely to be a problem, but barn cats aren't starving because their territory is probably full of easier prey like mice and they'll usually have access to kibble as well. If you do have a cat problem, a rooster can help. They're perpetually hopped up on testosterone and will not hesitate to throw down with animals many times their size.",

I mean if we had started with tigers we might have all kinds of weird cat breeds, but even still we do have quite a large variety of domestic cats... just all of them a bit more uniform as compared to dogs?",

They can live off what they catch on a farm of some size. If you own a farm with rats, you migt not even have to buy a cat, one will show up, no breeding needed. For that reason, once evolution got to \"perfect farm pest killing cat\", there wasn't much reason for humans to go on, unless you had a special place in your culture for cats, like the Egyptians.\n\nCats are one trick ponies, compared to dogs, but they are free and very good at what they do.",

(This can be natural or artificial).\n\nEvolution is not \"happy\" with anything. It always happens, whether good or bad. But you can maybe say **natural selection** isn't \"happy\" with dogs. We have evolved dogs through selective breeding (artificial selection) while at the same time forcing populations to be isolated. But this has led to a lot of inbreeding depression and tons of diseases &amp; disabilities.\n\nIf all this selective breeding stopped, over time dogs *may* all amalgamate again but this depends on their mating behavior and if that has changed.\n\nBonus: Sometimes if natural selection is \"too happy\" with something, it may also cause diversification, assuming you can be great at two things (eating birds and eating garbage) but there's a bit of a trade-off. Evolutionary ecology is complicated.",

Medium size, lean body shape, and upright ears. Basically, features that work well in the wild, as opposed to being very small (can't hunt or defend against other predators), very large (health issues), or floppy ears (worse directional hearing).\n\nThe specifics then depend on the environment. I would presume in cold environments, a wild dog population would become larger and with thicker fur, like northern wolves or coyotes, while in warmer climes they might keep a shorter fur and be overall smaller or leaner, since the size affects their volume to surface area ratio - a larger animal can conserve their body heat easier than a small animal.",

            "comment": "In addition to others discussions of degree of human control over mating, there's also a fundamental biological difference in how much the bones/other structures of dogs and cats shift from when they're young to when they're mature. Puppies and dogs have very different cranial bone ratios (just think of the face of a puppy vs the face of a full grown dog). Cats, on the other hand, have pretty much the same ratios from when they're born to when they're fully grown. Thus, it's much more likely that you get a random mutation that effects phenotype in dogs as they have way more moving parts that you can easily see the changes of.  \n\n[Source, Bones: A Treatise Volume 7](https://books.google.com/books?id=gi0j5sEIW8AC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=puppy+to+dog+skull+change+vs+kitten+to+cat+skull+change&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TeF1LnnZjD&amp;sig=ACfU3U2yO-8yh84bhC_2xTGCWRsYvKulzw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjikZTLg5voAhWJr54KHYgJBFgQ6AEwE3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=puppy%20to%20dog%20skull%20change%20vs%20kitten%20to%20cat%20skull%20change&amp;f=false)",

As the acronym suggests, SNPs are snips of printed DNA (now RNA) that get edited before it gets real and makes the real stuff.\n\nWhat are you talking about?  SNP is Single Nucleotide Polymorphism, a change in a single base pair compared to a reference genome.  Humans have them, too.  And plants.  And bacteria.  Dogs don't have more or less of them than would be expected for most mammals.\n\n&gt; SNPs' consequences are also kinda like a sentence instead of just a word.\n\nI have no idea what metaphor you're going for here, but this is very misleading.  A SNP is a single letter change and its functional consequences can range from nothing at all to death.\n\n&gt; Dogs are very flexible with changing their sentences and the sentences can vary wildly, which is very unique to their species.\n\nThis is not true, and the article you linked to in no way supports this assertion.  What the paper _does_ say is that a small number of loci are responsible for most of the variation we see in dogs.  That says nothing about how inherently \"flexible\" their species is or how \"very unique\" it is to them.  It only says that the selective pressure we've put on dogs manifested itself in a limited number of places.",

As the droplets merge, they seem to pop away, and then snap back into place in the cluster. How/why does this happen?",

            "comment": "The reason the droplets merge is due to Ostwald ripening. There is less surface area in one big droplet than in many small droplets of the same total volume, so the system can reduce energy by merging into one big droplet. \n\nThe reason a merge event causes a \"pop\" is due to surface tension and the intermediate shape of the merging droplets. Initially, there are two spherical surfaces separated by a thin film of air, water, or whatever is around the drops. When the droplets just start to merge, they make a sort of hourglass-like shape, with extremely sharp curvature at the \"neck.\" If you think of an atom of gallium positioned right at the sharp neck, the forces of surface tension tangent to the surface are not balanced. \n\nCompare to an atom on the surface of a perfect sphere. Locally to a single atom, the surface forms a flat plane around it, pulling it equally in all directions, so it doesn't move because there is no net force. At the neck, there is a net force, so the atom start to accelerate outward. The velocity of the ring of atoms around the next gets faster and faster until the neck becomes a flat connection between the two spheres. At this point, the net force is zero, but the atoms still have an outward velocity. An object in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by a force, so those atoms keep going until the neck bulges out. Then, an oppositely curved surface will start pulling them back. This makes the surface of the sphere oscillate back and forth for a bit, and this oscillation is what bounces all the other droplets around. Picture little beads bouncing on a vibrating subwoofer.",

If you open the wikimedia page for that file, it says that it's a clip from a longer YouTube video and links to that YouTube video. And in the YouTube video they show and narrate putting the gallium in a bath of hot sulfuric acid before breaking it into the small drops that then rejoin in that funny way.",

    "postText": "Question provoked by New York Times article I read today showing that this form of hydropower is becoming more popular, but that's behind paywall so I wont share here. Here are two descriptions that are not behind paywall:\n\n[https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower](https://www.energy.gov/eere/water/pumped-storage-hydropower)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage\\_hydroelectricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity)\n\nI'm not in this field so take my description with a grain of salt, but my understanding is that for this type of power generation, water is used to generate electricity by gravity, similar to standard hydroelectric power (e.g. a dam), but in 'off hours', excess electricity is used to pump water up from a lower reservoir to an upper one. When more electricity is needed, that upper reservoir is used (gravity flow down to lower reservoir) to generate electricity. \n\nI must be missing something--to my mind, based on classical physics, this seems like it must be inefficient--how can we pump water uphill with electricity, then use that water flowing back downhill to generate more electricity than it took to pump it uphill? I must be missing something--perhaps there's always a secondary source of power churning in the background that is always available for electricity generation, so it's just excess electricity from this that is used to pump water uphill? \n\nThanks in advance for enlightening me.",

            "comment": "You are correct, there is a loss- it takes more electricity to pump the water up to the reservoir than you get by releasing it. The benefit is that you get to choose when to release it. \n\nThe most simple example would be using excess solar power (that is, if during the day you're making more electricity than you need at that time) to pump water up the hill. Then, at night- when you no longer can generate solar power, you release that water, making electricity. As you surmised, there is a net loss of power, but the benefit is, you get the power when you need it.",

            "comment": "Other answers have covered that it's \"buy low sell high\" for electricity. You lose Joules but you gain money.\n\nA secondary reason to build pumped storage hydro is grid balancing and demand response. Power supplied and power demanded on an electrical grid must always match. If demand exceeds supply then the greater load on generators reduces their speed and output frequency. The smallest and shortest-term fluctuations are handled automatically, aided by the rotational kinetic energy in turbines and generators to smooth things out. But larger increases in demand over the course of seconds to minutes require choosing to bring more generators online. Hydroelectric is very good for this, and pumped storage allows building hydro where there's not much natural river flow.\n\nFor example Dinorwig Power Station in Wales can go from zero to 1800 megawatts in 16 seconds, with minimal cost while it's not outputting power. That's needed in Britain with its \"tv pickup\" demand spikes, and few other types of power stations can provide that kind of rapid response.\n\nEDIT PS: Example of TV pickup during a big football match, https://web.archive.org/web/20210712102541/https://twitter.com/NationalGridESO/status/1414508508318507008 . I know the y axis doesn't start at zero, but those are still rapid and significant demand spikes.",

As opposed to losing *all* of excess energy that you couldn't use/utilize within the moment of peak production - wind turbines work the best during strong wind (which usually happens within short time periods of certain seasons); solar panels don't work at night and almost don't work during cloudy days, but peak at cloudless noon.\n\nHydroelectric power generation is among THE most efficient generation methods available to us. Now, to the point that I deem relevant but no-one bothered to mention yet:\n\nWind energy's conversion to electricity cannot physically exceed Betz limit of 59.3%. Solar cells are limited by Shockley\u2013Queisser limit (33.16% for single-gap silicon). Not only liquid pumps and turbines can be made insanely efficient (80-95%), relative to literally any other method of power generation, they have insanely simple technology of production (unlike steam/gas turbine, you will not lose half of your efficiency if your turbine's blades are 0.5mm off; 200-watt Pelton turbine can basically be 3d-printed at home on the cheapest printer).\n\nThe only problem is that you need a level difference, and the more level difference you have, the better your storage will be. Level differences are very hard to create artificially (you'd need to make an artificial mountain), and they don't occur naturally everywhere.",

As you say, it's only the limit for single-junction/single-bandgap PV, but you can essentially stack multiple different solar cells optimized for different wavelengths if you need higher efficiency and it's worth the cost.

The whole point of this is to `store` energy. Think of this lake+dam as a giant battery. You charge it when you have too much power available (eg. when it's very sunny or very windy and solar/wind turbines produce more than the grid can consume). And then you discharge when you need a \"boost\". Yes, this wastes some of the energy, but there is not much else you could do.\nThe issue is that you can't easily lower the supply of energy from power plants, and you also can't push too much energy into the grid because voltage will go up and damage whatever is plugged-in. And certain power sources, like solar or wind, are unpredictable.",

So if you're raising it as far as it fell (i.e., far enough to generate the same amount of energy again) you're always coming out behind.\n\nThe benefit is only in moderating your power output to a rate at which you can usefully consume it elsewhere, not increasing your total energy output.",

            "comment": "This is a physics question. Electric fields and magnetic fields are linked, but you are looking at the behavior of electrons in materials here. The conductivity depends on how well electrons can move across the material, while the magnetic properties depend on how the magnetic moment of electrons (from their spin and their orbitals) align. These are generally independent things.\n\nSilver is diamagnetic, like many other elements. An external field will change the orientation of the magnetic moments of the electrons in silver, creating a weak opposing field. Copper, another excellent conductor, is diamagnetic as well.\n\nIn everyday use, \"magnetic\" usually refers to ferromagnetism, where the magnetic moments in the material will be aligned easily by an external field and point in the same direction (the material will be attracted by a magnet), and they can be aligned even in the absence of an external field, which means the material can be a permanent magnet. This is a very unusual condition and only a few pure elements show it, with iron being the most notable one. Usually we encounter iron as steel - some versions of it are ferromagnetic, others are not, it depends on the composition.",

Moving a conductive material through an electric field generates eddy currents in the object, and moving a current against the electromagnetic field (ex. dropping the object) takes force. Reminds me of the inertia that a spinning gyroscope has.",

Cold working creates martensitic phases in the metal.  \n\nFerritic stainlesses (409, 430, plus some others) and martinsitic stainlesses (knife and tool stainlesses) are ferromagnetic. \n\nThe main reason that some stainless is ferromagnetic while others are not has to do with their crystal structure. Austenite is a face-centered cubic structure- this configuration does not allow alignment of the dipole moments of the iron atoms in any direction. The martensite crystal structure is... sort of tetragonal (but with a lot of strain) and the ferrite crystal structure is body-centered cubic. Both of these phases allow for alignment of the magnetic domains when exposed to an external magnetic field. They're not typically aligned in any particular direction prior to being exposed to an external magnetic field, so they're not magnets.",

The electric charge is carried by the electrons, which have a negative charge. Metals usually have electrons in energy levels far from the positively charged nucleus to which they\u2019re attracted, so those electrons can easily hop around, carrying their charges with them. Magnetism, on the other hand, stems from the spin of the electrons. The \u201ctendency\u201d is for electrons to \u201corbit\u201d the nucleus in pairs of electrons with opposite spin, which cancel each other out. Elements with a number of unpaired electrons are susceptible to being magnetized. In other words, conductivity depends on how weakly nuclei hold to their electrons, whilst magnetism depends on whether those electrons are paired.

Magnetic materials are relatively uncommon, mainly iron and nickel and it's due to the arrangement of the crystalline structure in the metal which means that the electrons field all faces the same way or can be induced to face the same way.\n\nRegular metals don't have this. But as a metal they allow for free movement of electrons within the structure and electrical conductivity is determined by how easily it is for these electrons to do so. With silver copper and gold being great, but iron, lead and titanium being poor.  With enough current, anything can be conductive, hence with enough charge electricity can jump in the air and is not limited to metals for example graphine or liquid helium. These electrical conductivity properties also can also change with temperature.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n~~Electromagnetism as a field is essentially the study of the electron.~~ So while magnetism and electricity are both electromagnetism.

            "comment": "Electric conductivity is a metric of how easily a material conducts electric charge; that is allowing charge carrying electrons to move within the material when an attracting or repulsing field is applied.\n\nMagnetism is the result of motion of electrons. This motion can be linear, in which a charge carrying particle moves in a line. This happens when you have electric current in a wire and is explained by Ampere's law. The motion may also be circular, described by the a quality of electrons called spin. \n\nAt most times, with most materials, the total effect of spin from electrons cancels each other out. With some special material, the total spin is uneven, and the net effect is a \"static\" magnetic field. While \"static\" it's important to keep in mind that it is still due to motion of electric charge. \n\nSilver does not have a mismatch in electron spin, so there is no static magnetic field. However, it has a very loosely bound charge carrying electrons that will readily move when influenced by an electric field. This motion does create a magnetic field (per Ampere's law), but that field is only present when the linear motion is induced by an external field.",

            "comment": "Pretty sure any metal has magnetism if you're passing current through it.\n\nLike the demonstration where induced current in a copper mass causes it to sink slower when dropped.\n\nIron only saves magnetism because it has mismatched poles, and sticks that way because it's solid.\n\nWater H2O molecules are mismatched too, but it's liquid. Which I know is how microwaves work- the field twists the molecules, then reverses, twisting then back, then reverses, rapidly. This heats up your food.\n\n(But water is a liquid, so it can't save the alignment, and ice... must be some reason why ice isn't magnetic. IDK!)\n\nWhich is why something dry, like wax paper or paper towel only heats up if it can get wet. Or the ceramic.glass stuff doesn't get hot itself, just maybe trace water inside.",

Magnetism is fundamentally caused by electric current and changing electric flux, according to Ampere's law. If you run a current through a nonmagnetic metal, you will indeed see a magnetic field, but the true source of this field is the electrical field (flux),  not the metal material.\n\nThis may be what you meant, but I wanted to be clear too for others' benefit.",

Example iron, cobalt, nickel\nIn most materials, their magnetic domains do not align in one direction instead align everywhere and cannot respond to a magnetic field.\nWhen ferromagnetic materials get molten they are not magnetic and they crystallize in a way aligning with the earths magnetic field.",

            "comment": "WHAT MAKES A METAL MAGNETIC?\u00a0\n\nIf the crystalline structure of the atoms within a piece of metal is aligned so that all the spin of their electrons are the same, that metal will be magnetic, because the synchronic spin of the electrons generates a magnetic field.\n\nSome metals are ferromagnetic and capable of being magnetized. In their natural state, the atoms of ferromagnetic metals are usually not aligned but will need to be magnetized. When placing a ferromagnetic material under an external magnetic field the spin of electrons will strongly align with the direction of the field and it will become magnetic.\n\nSilver isn't ferromagnetic. The atoms are not aligned in any sort of way and the spin of their electrons is random and does not give rise to a magnetic field.",

This gives a really good estimation of the corrective lens prescription. A ballpark or rough estimation of the prescription.\n\nOnce someone learns his/her abc\u2019s or sometimes shapes a phoropter may be used. The device that sits in front of your face, and you are asked if one or two, or a or b looks better as you are looking at an eye chart. This allows for an even better prescription to be determined. The phoropter may be used by itself or it may be used to fine tune the prescription that the autorefractor read, so you get the best possible vision.\n\nIt\u2019s not that an adult\u2019s autorefratcor generated prescription couldn\u2019t be used, but your doctor wants your eyewear to have the best chance for giving you the best possible sight.",

This way even if you can't sit still, the measurement would just take longer, but it would eventually have a good enough measurement.  This might even provide better data since measuring eye orientation allows correction of the data for tiny saccades.",

It blows air at your eye and measures resistance to determine your eye pressure.

She was 7 years old, and she's nearly 7 years younger than me, so I went first to show her it was no big deal. I actually had no idea because it was my first exam as well, (we had a crappy mom) but I never wanted her to be afraid. As I remember mine was quick and then they took me to an exam room, the exam was also fast; the school nurse thought I must be far sighted because I could read the chart from way outside her office (I had 20/10 vision.) I remember thinking it was taking quite a awhile for my sister's exam, not knowing she was still at the pressure test. I suddenly heard her yell something, then she marched right into my exam room and started animatedly telling me \"they just kept blowing the thing then eye drops then poking and then getting someone else for more blowing and poking and I just couldn't stand it!\" (she didn't pause the whole tirade.) She was all worked up making big hand gestures while telling me this. Because I had gone first she knew that wasn't normal. Turns out no one told her why they were doing all that and patience is not one of her virtues. I asked what she yelled and she calmly told me she had just asked them \"What the hell is wrong with you people, are you on crack?!\" She said it to me like 7 year olds normally do that kinda thing! She turned out to have the eye pressure of an 80 year old woman, so they checked a few times, then showed every one. We didn't get her vision exam done that day for obvious reasons. It's about 20 years later and she hasn't worn her glasses since she was 12. How she functions I don't know. ",

It often feels like they're trying to rush you through, and they often are only trying to get within 0.5 dioptres of your 'true' value (which sounds pretty far off).\n\nI think though that your best bet is just to tell them that you find the test difficult, and that you would please like to go a little more slowly than usual. Also perhaps try to find a nice (perhaps local?) opticians who is going to give you the time you need. Perhaps even more important than either of those though -- you should check with them their returns policy, and if you aren't happy with your new lenses then take them back and ask for a retest!\n\nFinally, I would say that the reason they are maybe a bit pushy is because actually they know from experience that 'about right' is often totally fine for most people, and that your eyes will quickly adjust, so maybe you don't actually need to worry so much about striving for perfection. Still, they're *your* eyes, so I don't think it's unreasonable for you to want to spend a bit of time getting your prescription right!",

                    "comment": "little kids are fit with eyewear when their prescription is large enough that it will prevent normal visual development. for vision to develop normally, the retina has to receive a moderately clear image of either near *or* far objects- it needs *something* to be clear so essentially it can develop those connections which \"see\" details. when this doesn't happen, usually due to a really big near or far sighted prescription, you give the kid correction. (there are plenty of other problems that can occur that would require surgical intervention but we're just covering big prescriptions here.) now, it doesn't have to give them 20/20, in fact, it probably won't. it just needs to make them see *as well as they can at that time.* then with the help of the clearer images provided by the new prescription, their eyes develop and their best possible acuity increases. after a couple months, you double check them to see if a new prescription will be even better for them...and so on until they are on the right track to have clear vision while wearing the proper prescription. to do this for little kids, you use objective measures (ie, ways that *don't require responses* like the \"1 or 2\" method) like retinoscopy or an autorefractor combined with cycloplegia (which relaxes the focusing system and lets you get the most accurate objective measure). problem with these objective ways of finding a prescription is that they only take into account the physical/optical characteristics of the eye, they don't account for the highly subjective experience that is vision. vision is more than just an eyeball getting an in focus or out of focus image- it's all the processing that occurs afterward, as well, that is complex beyond explanation. that is why the \"1 or 2\" method *still*, despite all of our technology, works the best: because it's the person saying *what looks best to them.* so you use the objective methods on kids to make sure their vision develops normally and then, when they're old enough, you use the subjective, \"1 or 2\", method to get them the best possible correction.",

It is you saying what you like better.  \n\nA doctor can use streak retinoscopy to get any ones prescriptions.  However, if the patient is able to speak, it is good to confirm, and tweak, if needed, the prescription.

If people have preferences for neutral eye focus, they aren't going to notice that in three seconds of looking through lens A and lens B. Those muscles take time to get tired. \n\nThere's also the question of why not measure the focus objectively and then offer people a slight offset to either side, rather than random-walking around the space of lens configurations based on a noisy predictor.\n\nEDIT: so you understand where I'm coming from, here's a story about VR. To save money and weight, VR headsets use cheap, lightweight lenses that distort the crap out of the image but keep it in focus. To correct for this, the headset drivers use a distortion matrix to pre-warp the image to compensate for that distortion. A mistake a lot of hmd makers used to make was to calibrate the distortion matrix subjective (tweak and check). They tended to end up *way* off, and it was bad for users. Now everybody measures it with a test pattern and a computer and it's much better. Humans are inherently unreliable at this stuff.",

This system is built on the optics found in the eye, no different to the optics of a camera lens. There are two movements we expect to see, they are an against or with movement. An against movement means you need a negative lens correct (myopia) and a with movement means you need a positive lens to correct (hyperopia). You can also calculate astigmastism with retinoscopy, and this is where it becomes difficult. \n\nIn the hands of a capable operator, retinoscopy is far more accurate than any modern autorefractor (for now) as operators have trained many years to use a retinoscope. The problem with current auto-refractors is that they do not account for accommodation in the eye; think when you switch between looking at something far away like the horizon and then looking at your phone quickly. Do you sometimes notice it takes a microsecond or two to adjust? Thats your accommodation working, your eye lens physically changes shape in order for you to see your phone clearly; think chaning focal lenghts on a camera zoom. Accommodation breaks down around 40years old progressively until around 60 and this is why people need reading glasses. I digress. \n\nAuto-refractors are still a very important screening tool in helping aid reaching your final prescription, however the results are not generally completely reliable. \n\nI hope that helps.\n\nSource: OD. \n",

Although every optometrist should be able to do retinoscopy to some extent, it is an extremely hard technique to master that requires much experience and practice. For example there are paediatric ophthalmologist who specialise in cases like your daughters that would take few seconds to do what would take me a minute or two and leading on there would be those that would struggle to get an answer at all. \n\nIn the case of your daughter, it would depend on how the retinoscopy was performed and compentency of the operator. If she had drops to dilate her pupils to knockout her accommodation system for reasons I outlined above, and the operator was good, the reading most likely be accurate. Otherwise, no; for the same accommodation reasons above. \n\nI am not doubting you, but think its hard to use anecdotal evidence such as seeing a bird to make judgements on how well a person can see. For example, one eye might be good, but the other eye is the one that needs glasses. You should definitely get it checked out again if you have a chance as teenagers are at a critical age of puberty and development and this is when things have the highest chance of going wrong with the eye; as you taller, your eyeball increases in length.\n\nI wish you all the best. I am trying to offer you the best advice I can give over reddit, but I cannot replace going to see an optometrist or ophthalmologist in person.  ",

            "comment": "Doctors/optometrists fit children with these prescriptions simply because there isn't a good way of doing it subjectively. Speaking as a pre-registration optometrist in England I will try and explain why this is the case as best i can.\n\nSubjective results are generally better because we must control a process we call \"accommodation\"  i.e. the ability young individuals have to focus for near. Optics 101 also shows that you can use this additional focusing power to focus through some prescriptions, for example \"long sighted\" or plus prescriptions, this causes long term issues in patients because this requires effort and causes eyestrain. In children the ability to accommodate is very high. Trust me when I say it is much easier to relax this accommodation in someone who a.) Has less ability to do it and b.) Can understand subjectively when a lens makes no difference to their sight. These are both adult qualities, as a result we must do it differently for children. \n\nThe way we generally do it is by relaxing the accommodation with drops called cycloplegics, these drugs then have side effects which then make subjective testing EVEN harder. For example it makes your pupils larger which can then cause glare which could be mistaken for blur. We must then use objective methods to determine a rough estimate of the prescription because the patient cannot operate subjectively, it is by no means more accurate. \n\nBUT that's not to say it is going to damage your child's sight, we tend to give these prescriptions simply to relax the child's eye muscles and allow for NORMAL ocular development. Normal ocular development shows that children tend to be slightly long sighted and become more short sighted until they have no prescription, this is normal because the larger your eye the more short sighted you become. It's obviously normal for your eyes to become larger as the body gets bigger. This is why we only correct gross long sightedness (we rarely intervene with short sightedness because glasses may not help much, specialist CLs are generally used for these children).\n\n As you can probably deduce now, it does not matter if we leave the child slightly long sighted because they have a large amount of accommodation, so the fact our prescriptions will be slightly off when obtained objectively (which they will be) will not be an issue. It's all about reducing the amount of long sightedness to a point which will not cause the patient to accommodate TOO much, which will then cause eyestrain and even lazy eyes (accommodation also stimulates the eyes to turn in as well). Lazy eyes are the worst case scenario in children undergoing ocular development, because the brain is still malleable or \"plastic\". Therefore, it can develop to IGNORE the visual information being sent by the lazy eye (therefore, the brain is avoiding double vision and blur) and cause very reduced vision in that eye in later life. \n\nIn my experience, I generally prescribe long sighted prescriptions causing problems (for example lazy eyes) then use further tests to monitor whether the prescription has removed the lazy eye at future visits. I refer short sighted/ different prescriptions in each eye (anisometropia) to specialists to fit contact lenses etc. Some children also need patching to remove this dominance issue which is undertaken by other specialists. \n\nTLDR: we generally prescribe children to relax their \"accommodation\" to the point where it doesn't cause them any issues (lazy eyes/eyestrain). The long sighted child will see fine regardless of if a prescription is in place or not because their ability to accommodate through long sighted prescriptions is so good. Objective methods are not superior but are our only alternative. Prescribing for short sighted children or children with prescriptions which are different in each eye are more complex and require contact lens intervention. We prescribe for those children to slow the progression of short sightedness or to make the images formed by each eye more equal. Again, having the exact right prescription may not be possible for these children without subjective methods but we definitely allow the children's ocular development to be less affected by their incorrect prescription. The goal in prescribing for children is usually not to let them see clearly but to improve their ocular development.\n\nPhew, that's hard to explain in layman's terms.\n",

He squints when looking further than a few feet. All his close relatives wear glasses. I assume he could benefit from glasses but everyone just says \"you can't do a vision test on someone who can't express\". This thread seems to suggest otherwise? \n\nIs there anyone that could help him?",

Whether or not you have any concerns isn\u2019t a very good way to detect eye diseases early enough to prevent vision loss. For example, if you had glaucoma but didn\u2019t see anyone until you had symptoms, it\u2019s way too late to do anything meaningful about it. That\u2019s why they do the health screening in eye exams. In many eye diseases vision loss can be prevented, but not cured once it occurs.",

                            "comment": "As others have mentioned, getting to 20/20 vision is a meld of fixing physical optics that your brain has been filtering and layering your entire life. Vergence disorders specifically have to do with the binocular attributes of the eye muscles and the brains ability to get stereo 3D vision. A simple example \n: While most people would have no trouble looking at their pointer finger pointing straight up as they slowly bring it towards their nose, some patients experience profound double vision in this scenario. This is because their vergence system cannot physically bring their eyes to a crossed position when looking at their finger. To make things more complicated, the binocular vergence system can be stressed or relaxed with the use of normal prescription glasses. + lenses for far sighted individuals reduce their ability to converge and look at their finger close to their nose because the + lenses move their eyes to a more divergent posture. The opposite happens for - lenses for near sighted patients. There are many treatment options that involve altering the glasses a patient in this situation would wear. So if a patient who is unable to converge their eyes and is also far sighted were to get an auto refracted prescription for their far sightedness only, they could actually experience persistent double vision a short while after they put their new glasses on. This of course results in every optometrists favorite thing, the patient comes back into the store without an appointment saying \"I can't see anything out of these glasses you gave me!\" So whole objective devices and techniques are absolute necessary in this field, using them solely for prescribing glasses would result in far more headaches for the doctor in prescription remakes than speedy patient exams.

This can be determined by retinoscopy (a technique that utilizes optics performed by a doctor). But adults have much better visual acuity and can determine the difference of a quarter diopter so the doctor asks which is better to get the exact prescription. But even then the doctor determines what the patient can actually handle by showing those lenses in free space because large changes in prescriptions can be rejected by patients. \n\nTLDR; ask your optometrist or ophthalmologist not reddit.

If you had better eyesight in the past, the brain learned how to tweak the image to get rid of it correctly.\n\nOnce an adult switches to an eyewear, the brain starts forgetting to do things without eyewear, and you become dependent on it. It is a tradeoff between having to wear the eyewear all the time, or going along with what the brain is able to already deal with.\n\nBaby brains have zero practice, so even if they would be able to answer, it would be identical to the instrumental readings.",

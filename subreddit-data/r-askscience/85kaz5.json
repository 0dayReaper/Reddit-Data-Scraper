Consider a dog, whose shoulder is not much wider than its head. Laying on its side, the spinal column remains mostly straight. If an ape, or human for that matter, sleeps on its side, the spine ends up bent wildly out of line in order for the head to rest on the same surface as the shoulder. So we add some fluff to fill the gap. ",

            "comment": "The answer, as far as I can tell, is that we don\u2019t know for certain. What we know about the development of pillows and bedding, however, suggests a few options. \n\nI found this site which details the history of the pillow. \n\nhttp://hankeringforhistory.com/pillows-throughout-the-ages-guest-post/\n\nThe oldest known pillows date back around 9,000 years and are made of carved stone. The shape suggests suggests an attempt at providing comfort...a smooth surface is much better for laying your head on, after all, than a rough one. It\u2019s also been suggested by historians that pillows like this protected people from bugs. It\u2019s possible, therefore, that cavemen used nearby rocks to keep their heads elevated. \n\n\nThis is not, however, the oldest known bedding. That dates back 77,000 years and consists of compressed grass, leaves, and plant stems found at archaeological site called the Sidubu Cave. Interestingly, the specific plants they found in the bedding served as natural insecticides, suggesting that protection from bugs was at the front of mind due cavemen as it was for ancient Egyptians. It\u2019s possible a mound of this material was used on top of the bedding as a makeshift pillow. Here is the study. \n\nhttp://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/12/earliest-human-beds-found-south-africa\n\nLastly, the Japanese Geisha have used wooden blocks with cushioning on top to serve as a pillow. These blocks allowed them to protect their elaborate hair styles while sleeping. A log or other piece of wood, therefore, is a potential third option for cavemen pillows. \n\nIn the case of rocks and pillows, there\u2019s no reason grass and leaves couldn\u2019t have been used as a softer barrier to increase comfort. We wouldn\u2019t know that, however, since such technology wouldn\u2019t necessarily register with archaeologists if it wasn\u2019t shaped or processed on some way such as to distinguish it from other debris. \n\nEdit: the rocks are no longer imprisoned.

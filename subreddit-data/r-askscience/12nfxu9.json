    "postText": "The Darien Gap is the approximately 66 mile gap near the Panama-Columbia border where the Pan-American highway is interrupted. Many lay articles describe construction in the area as \"impossible\". Now I know little about engineering, but I see us blow up mountains, dig under the ocean, erect suspension bridges miles long, etc., so it's hard for me to understand how construction anywhere on the surface of the Earth is \"impossible\". So what is it about this region that makes it so that anyone who wants to cross it has to risk a perilous journey on foot?\n\n:edit: thought I was asking an engineering question, turns out it was a political/economics question",

            "comment": "It isn\u2019t impossible; just impractical and expensive. There is little reason for a highway to exist there, except perhaps to complete a line on a map. An extensive national park exists in the way of the formerly planned road, and environmental concerns kept the road from being completed in the 1970s. Later efforts to complete the roadway ran into opposition from environmentalists and local native populations. Journeys through the area are generally done using boats (pirogues / piraguas) rather than foot. A ferry bypassing the area operated for awhile but eventually was shut down as unprofitable.",

As it stands, it's a natural barrier to mass drug trafficking. Right now, drug trafficking through Panama is considerable, imagine how it would boom if it was made easier to travel.\n\nDon't know from the Colombian side but considering that they have some big guerrilla organizations over there, I'd imagine they wouldn't want to give up their controlled land without a fight.",

This question would be better put to ask politics than ask science, because one of the biggest reasons it hasn't been built, is that Panama used to be a part of Colombia, and Panama still fears the potential for Colombia to invade and try to reunite the two territories today. You also completely left out the massive risk from tropical diseases in that region. There's Malaria, Dengue, Yellow Fever, and Zika, just to start with the mosquito borne illnesses, and there are ticks as well with their own fun diseases, venomous snakes and spiders, poisonous amphibians, and all sorts of other health threats.\n\n One of my favorite youtubers did a video on the topic recently (with some inaccuracies so don't take it as a purely factual source, they made an error in their statements about concrete hardening that I spotted), and covered the multitude of social and political reasons why it hasn't happened yet in the process, in addition to some of the scientific reasons why not. It's well worth a watch, and I think it also disproves your statement that there is \"little need\" for a road there, considering how many people risk their lives every year to cross the gap for one reason or another. That suggests there is in fact a mighty need if you ask me https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX4J4p4R1QU",

The problem is there's not really much demand for that, there may be a local use for the road, but as far as good going between north and south America are concerned, a long road journey all the way through every central American country with all the customs involved is just never going to compete with ships.  Most of the population in both continents is on the coast, perfect for the ships, while road links through the interior in South America are not great.",

            "comment": "I work in construction engineering, and reviewed a case study on the Pan-American Highway and exactly this region. If we were to execute on it today, you'd need project sponsorship as other people here are discussing. After the shaky politics and coups performed for the entire construction of the Panama Canal, many local groups are doubtful. Native or Aboriginal Rights are becoming very well recognized and respected, and this can create roadblocks though you can typically work with groups to find a solution. The next is the actual area: marshy. Unless you were to commence a mega-project to build an incredibly long viaduct, worth billions of USD, it'd be such a cruel and inefficient headache to construct. I've done a lot of work in marshy territory, along coasts, in bogs, and the moment your ground settles and inch your entire project can be ruined. Other options would be replacing the marsh with structurally capable earth, but that's environmentally and economically unwise. You'd essentially have to have a road supported by piles, hence a viaduct design for at least part of this stretch. \n\nIf it were ever to pass sponsorship level and secure funding, the next issue becomes contractor risk. It's such an environmentally diverse but risky area in it's wetlands, but it is also so dense with dangerous wildlife that there'd be serious control plans put in place. No longer are we building the Boulder Dam or Panama Canal at great, reckless cost to human life. \n\nInterestingly, a massive viaduct design can be constructed \"top-down\", where one section of bridge or one \"span\" is constructed from a just completed span behind it. There comes other concerns in this case with the long term viability of this design, namely considerations that have stopped other viaduct megaprojects in such regions include: seismic, foundation depth, and bedrock competency. \n\nIt's not \"impossible\", if the need ever came where traffic reached unsustainable levels then they could for sure plan one, but it's unlikely to ever be sponsored and if it were there'd be record-levels of funding required to see it through construction. Any desktop value engineering review has basically put this project to bed for the near future.",

That section of I-10 is only like maybe 10 miles though. \n\nThe Causeway over Lake Pontchartrain is logistically and technically much simpler - it\u2019s just built over a relatively shallow lake in a straight line. \n\nThe portions of I-10 and I-55 I\u2019m referring to were built through dense marsh and swamp where they had to clear out vegetation, drive pilings (also required for the causeway), and not everything was in a straight line. It\u2019s also in a very unforgiving area where there is nothing but swamp until you get to either side of the gap. \n\nThe section of I-10 over the Atchafalaya Basin (between Baton Rouge and Lafayette) might be a good (even better) comparison as well. \n\nHowever, in both these cases, I still don\u2019t think the level of vegetation density is comparable to the Darien Gap.",

Brazil's primary population centers \u2014 which has the largest economy in South American by a good margin \u2014 are separated from the region by the Amazon, which is an even greater engineering challenge than Darien.\n\nSo bridging the Darien gap would have very limited economic utility. The trade that currently occurs between Panama and its neighbors to the south is easily conducted by sea transit.\n\nThen you have the downsides. Panama-Columbia relations aren't great. Panama used to be part of Columbia.

Mostly from failed states such as Haiti and Venezuela. All going to the USA.\n\nThe authors of that article interviewed many of the migrants. All described unpleasant economic conditions at home. All were keen on adopting the American lifestyle of profligate overconsumption and waste.\n\nMany had small children or were planning to have children as soon as possible.\n\nThis illustrates a core scientific problem: that humans do not have the innate capacity to control our own numbers. (Pace, futurists, and please grow up and engage with reality: the problem is not self-solving.)\n\nThe immediate result of this scientific fact is that we have lost a huge proportion of the pollenators and at least fifty percent of the fauna on planet Earth in the last fifty years. The oceans are almost destroyed. Soon we will not have clean air to breathe or clean water to drink.\n\nInevitably, the extinction of our beloved species must follow.\n\nThe Darien Gap is a weak opposer of the human depredation of our planet. A highway through Darien would likely have more devastating consequences than any highway before, including the Kinshasa Highway (although we have probably not seen the end of *those* particular consequences).\n\nHopeful me thinks that some aspect of the collective American Nightmare is aware of the problem, at least on a subconscious level, and has failed to push the Pan-American Highway through Darien because it is a universally terrible idea.\n\nBut, truthfully, it's probably just because no one has figured out how to make a billion dollars by building it.

            "comment": "We can calculate things like gravity and energy density of the universe base on how the galaxies behave on a cosmic scale.  We can also calculate how much stuff is out there by direct observation.  When we look at the cosmos and look at how the galaxies behave, there is not enough material to generate the gravity (even when accounting for all the gas and dust that may obscuring it).  So there's some matter that doesn't emit light but still generates that gravity we see.  We call it dark matter, because that's what it is: dark.\n\nThere's also an expansion to the universe that suggests that the energy density is not what we can directly measure.  There's a bunch of stuff out there causing the universe to expand at an accelerated rate.  We call it dark energy, because, hey, we have dark matter already--why not call it \"Dark Energy\"; that way it sounds cool.\n\nSo there's like 5 times as much matter as what we can see, and like 3 times as much energy density as what can be explained by that matter.  So that's where the percentages come from: just add up all the stuff we know about that makes up the universe even if we don't yet know what that stuff is.",

The name dark matter doesn\u2019t necessarily assume it\u2019s matter or any other effect. Luminiferous aether did assume the cause of an effect, it assumed the solution to medium-less wave propagation. Our observations are accurate in terms of raw data, the question of why our observations differ from theory are all summed up together in the name dark matter. Dark matter is merely the name for the phenomena because it\u2019s the simplest and most obvious explanation, but that explanation is not presumed. \n\nEdit: Luminiferous Arthur is a respected scientist and you should all be ashamed! ^/s",

But I think in that scenario most or all would agree that it constitutes a direct observation, in contrast to our current observations of its effects.\n\nOh and also, I agree that gravity is not a lesser force!

That's how you learn more about something.\n\nBut particles only interact using four fundamental forces/interactions, and not all particles are affected by all forces. It is usually easier for us to inspect something with the electromagnetic interaction (light, magnetic fields, etc) than with gravity, because of the precision it affords us. We can still detect some things with gravity, like satellites detecting minute changes based on flying over mountain ranges or using LIGO to detect black hole mergers.\n\nBut so far we only know dark matter by its gravity. It won't emit light or interact excitingly with other objects in space. With black holes we had predictions about their existence before we ever found any and they have very acutely powerful gravitational interactions which let us both detect mergers and see powerful local effects on other stellar objects and accreting gas/dust. But dark matter is very diffuse, affecting only on large scales.\n\nSo it's not that we don't have the equipment, exactly. We don't know what will let us get a closer look, if anything.\n\nNeutrinos I believe were predicted to exist (because they filled a missing spot in the math) and postulated as a dark matter candidate, but I believe they were also predicted to interact via the weak nuclear interaction, which meant if you tried long enough to hit it directly with other matter, you might. And we eventually did. Iirc we then discovered they were not massive enough to account for dark matter. I hope I have the order right here.\n\nSo when you have predictions about what you're looking for, it makes it easier. With dark matter, we don't have much to go on, and the one way we know it interacts (gravity) isn't a good way of getting a close look at something so diffuse.\n\nEdit: meth -&gt; math lol",

There are weakly interacting particles that were once thought to be massless and now believed to have mass like [neutrinos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino). Part of the mass that we can't find is neutrinos, because they are very difficult to detect. There have been simulations where the missing mass is all neutrinos, but they don't match with what we see in the real world, so neutrinos can't be the only explanation. Small dark bodies like asteroids could be an explanation for part of it too, but again, simulations that have the entire amount of missing mass made of small cold rocks don't match observations, plus the extra mass doesn't seem to be concentrated in the galactic disk, like rocky material orbiting the galaxy would be expected to do. \n\nSo \"dark matter\" is sort of a catchall term for all of the stuff contributing to gravity that we have not yet identified, and the amount of it required means that some of it is likely to be some sort of exotic matter that we haven't seen yet, since simulations using stuff we have seen don't fit observations.",

It was a theory that was based on how similar things work, but didn't have experimental evidence.\n\nDark matter is almost the opposite. We have a theory of gravity. We have observations based on that theory of gravity. There is a disparity between those observations that is not accounted for by what we know about. So we give that disparity a name. \"Dark matter\" is the name given to a gap in our theoretical models that we know about because of experimental observations.\n\nIf you insist on comparing dark matter to a scientific thing that ended up being wrong and replaced with something right, I might go with epicycles -- they were refinements to our theoretical model for how heavenly bodies orbited based on increasingly accurate observations.",

You can isolate a system in a laboratory small enough to take measurements of the entire system and demonstrate conservation. This is significantly harder to do on the cosmic scale.\n\nIt's kind of like asking if light from a star that travels away from us (therefor exiting our visible universe) counts as energy loss for our universe. Technically yes, because that energy is forever lost to *us* but actually no, that light will not dissipate over time except through interactions that we know conserve energy.",

A absolute disproving of dark matter would likely lead us to throw out most of modern astrophysics. As you might imagine, this would also be pretty hard to accomplish, what with it not reacting to light and all.\n\nThese kinds of additions have been revoked before, though. Aether was introduced into early scientific models to give light a material to travel through (much like sound and other waves need). The famous \"Michelson\u2013Morley experiment\" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment)) showed this couldn't be the case, and so science moved on to realize that Light was made of Photons and therefore didn't need a material to transmit.\n\nOther examples exist, but for now we know that if our observations are correct and that there our current model is accurate to some respect, then some matter exists that we can't see.",

Spoiler - lots more than we can see. Even tenuous, cold hydrogen gas interacts with light, and that wouldn't explain a lot of other astrophysical phenomena, so this has to be something else.",

When matter (we're mainly talking hydrogen and helium here) get beyond a certain density, stars start to form. Stars emit light, and we understand the masses and densities of stars very well. Matter can of course end up in black holes and a few other dense, exotic objects like neutron stars that we can't directly see, but by and large we understand pretty well how many of these could be formed for every number of visible stars we see.\n\nOur working model of the universe suggests quite strongly that galaxies form inside big clumps of invisible dark matter - that it's the gravity of the dark matter clumps that helps the gas to fall in and eventually get dense enough to form stars and galaxies. These dark matter halos we can measure with gravitational lensing and other ways. Despite the totally unknown nature of dark matter, it's really hard to explain all the other stuff we see without it.",

The first is through the direct observations we can make in the universe of the gravitational effects. The presence of matter and thus gravity naturally effects how things move or rotate, and how fast; so from the scale of stars to galaxies to groups and clusters of galaxies, we can build up a working picture, combined with gravitational lensing that sometimes gives us a very accurate measure. The second is from simulations - there is a big industry in cosmology building big simulations of the evolution of matter on enormous scales over billions of years, and from this we can get a decent picture of how [matter on large scales](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/the-beautiful-complexity-of-the-cosmic-web/) ends up at the present day.  \n\nAs for how uniform it is, well we know it's in spherical clumps (we call them halos since they surround galaxies and clusters); we have some [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navarro%E2%80%93Frenk%E2%80%93White_profile) derived from observation that describe how they get denser towards the middle and more tenuous at the edges. We also know these clumps draw together and merge over the history of the universe.\n\n*Edited to add:* Where is it - yes, our galaxy like all others sits in a dark matter halo, and most of the matter in the universe is dark matter, so finding some would seem to be easy. As for whether we could we study a particle - we have a few ideas and experiments trying to detect whether they interact with normal matter even a tiny bit, but so far finding a way to actually study one and figure out its properties eludes us. There's a Nobel prize waiting for anyone that cracks that one!",

As for the rest of us, we work in the 4-dimensional spacetime of general relativity, which explains so much of what we observe as accurately as we can possibly measure. Adding extra dimensions doesn't solve anything - in fact, it's a mathematical fact that you can't get stable gravitational orbits in space of greater than three dimensions, so for now that's what we're stuck with.\n\nThere's a theory that dark matter will interact with regular matter very infrequently via the weak nuclear force (that DM is WIMPs - Weakly Interacting Massive Particles). There are experiments underway right now to try and detect such interactions, so far with no luck (whereas neutrino astronomy is now a well developed science). We'd also might expect to see some trace of interactions with normal matter from the places where both are really dense, such as the centre of the galaxy. There have been some hints there but nothing really compelling yet.",

Looking at the cosmic microwave background, we find that it's extremely uniform in all directions, down to the millionth of a degree. This strongly implies the universe is the same in all directions, ever since when the universe was incredibly hot and dense in the very first infinitesimal fractions of a second after the big bang.\n\nThe expansion we see of the universe is an expansion of space itself, not a gravitational pull from \"outside\". The expansion of space itself lengthens the wavelength of light travelling through it, something we detect in basically everything we look at. So there can't be a \"pull\" in the sense you might be imagining. It's worth mentioning that the equations of general relativity, which is our theory of gravity and has withstood every test we can throw at it, can give you some relatively simple equations that clearly predict the expansion of space. The 'discovery' of dark energy, an extra factor that is making the expansion speed up, is an exciting complication but doesn't change the unavoidable fact that the fabric of space itself is expanding.

I'm not a person that dismisses the possibility of a multiverse. The concept of eternal inflation, that the fabric of reality is eternally expanding at a mind-boggling rate but small pockets will stop inflating and form universes like ours, perhaps with different laws of physics. This theory has some real evidence behind it, it's amazing to think about.\n\nI think what you're referring to with the specific constants is what's known as \"[fine tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuned_Universe)\" - if we look at the fundamental constants of the universe, changing any of them by even a small amount would mean that life could not exist - stars wouldn't form, complex chemistry would not be possible, etc. Why should the universe be so precisely right for life and all we see to exist? It's interesting to think about, though a real answer may elude us forever.",

That is, in some intuitive sense, why things like falling into gravitational wells, or why springs enjoy being at their preferred length. (Side note: a key component of the energy of a thing is the **potential**. For gravity, far away the potential is about 0, but it lowers and lowers and lowers as you get closer, and objects want to \"fall\" down this hole. How fast they do fall down depends on how fast they were going before, and how steep the slope of the \"hole\" is)\n\nQuantum Field Theory (sorry) is a theory which attempts (quite successfully - as in, it's the most successful theory ever made, even more so than GR) to push bits and bobs of Special Relativity (SR) into Quantum Mechanics (QM). A consequence of QFT is that there exist **fields** that permeate the entire universe, and things that we know of as electrons, photons, quarks, bosons, everything, are **excitations** of these fields. An electron is a little bump in the electron field, and a photon is a little bump in the EM field. Quarks are a lot harder, but they are still bumps in a field.\n\nBecause **maths**, the energy density of the field (amount of energy per volume) is a function of the field (you have a location, you plug the *value* of the field into a number cruncher, and you get a number at the end which is an energy density). This energy density *function* has a minimum point, which the fields typically sit at, because things like being at low energy. But, *what if* there is another minimum? Some other value of the field which produces a lower energy density? Thanks to quantum tunnelling, there is a nonzero probability that the field will just find itself able to descend to this new minimum energy density (again, sorry for the geometric metaphors but if you look at the graphs it genuinely looks like things are falling down holes). \n\nSo what happens when the field finds the new minimum? The bits of field that are nearby will find out very quickly, because the information about this new minimum will spread at the speed of light away from the point where it was first 'discovered'. An expanding sphere of influence will grow into the universe, a boundary where within its reach, the laws of physics of the outside have absolutely no say. Every bit of matter, dark matter, energy, dark energy it touches will be consumed, the very rules by which it plays the game of existence changing as it is encompassed by this new region. Experiencing the change is likely to be instantaneous death, as the very rules which cause electrons and protons and neutrons will be fundamentally changed. The fundamental particles that make up the matter of your body will no longer behave the same, or even exist. It's tough to say what would happen in this new vacuum, the only certainty is that you'd be fried by the utterly absurd energies being released at the surface of this new region (as in, Big Bang fried) followed by your constituent matter no longer being supported by their field and just kind of... dissolving or something.\n\nTo ease your mind, if a field were to find a new minimum, starting at the centre of our galaxy, it would take 50,000 years to erase the galaxy, 2.5 million years to reach Andromeda, 10 million years to swallow the Local Group, 500 million years to remove the Virgo Supercluster, and of course around 13 billion years to annihilate the universe. Not that we would see it coming, but hey, if it's already started, we've probably got some time left to enjoy it.\n\nFinal side note: this is related to Inflation Theory in cosmology, except in that the field in question is a completely new field, with particles called inflatons which may or may not be observable, and in most forms the field has a *time dependant\" component, allowing the energy to be released in both a more global and controlled way.\n\nI hope this made sense!",

Some of them lead to very bright phenomena (quasars, active galactic nuclei) that we can detect from across very large distances. Astronomers have pretty good rough rules for how big a central black hole will be from the size of (say) the bulge in the galaxy. \n\nThis all means that there's enough known about SMBHs to know that they aren't collectively massive enough or on the right places to be our dark matter candidate.",

We detected x mass from gravity and y mass from light, but x is greater than y, so we realized that there had to be more mass that just doesn't interact with the electromagnetic force. Since light is made of electromagnetic waves, we named it dark matter. \n\nDark energy was realized when we tried to observe the expansion of the universe. Instead of a steady collapse due to gravity, we noticed that the universe was either going to stop over time or expand faster. Gravity is slowing the expansion from the inflationary period after the big bang, but that slowing isn't what we expected. This made us realize there is some sort of energy that is expanding the universe, and that is dark energy. It is named as a nod towards dark matter and the fact that we have no information about it.",

While this question is still certainly open for debate, the general consensus within the field has shifted to the point where we almost certainly believe this is a particle and not some unknown property of gravity. There are many reasons for this, but my favorite and probably the most straight forward comes from our observations of the Bullet Cluster. \n\nTake a look at this [graphic by NASA](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30094). The pink represents where most of the 'normal' matter is. Loose gas, stars, etc. The blue represents where most of the *gravity* is in the photo. Even though you can't see the mass directly, it warps and distorts our image of the galaxies behind it by a phenomena known as gravitational lensing, which can be preciously measured. When these two clusters collided, all of the gas got slowed down as the galaxies began to interact and merge. However, since dark matter doesn't interact with normal matter very easily (otherwise we would have detected it by now), it flows right through. MOND simply doesn't have an elegant solution to this while the dark matter model does.\n\nEdit: a word",

If that is indeed the case, we might have a real problem, as if it is only something that doesn't appear nearby, that might be an indication of something being off in our observations of more distance objects; however, this idea is disputed by other studies.\n\nDark Energy, conversely, is more or less \"the macroscopic scale of the universe is wrong unless we add in this other factor\". It would not be in the least bit surprising to discover that Dark Energy is the result of some sort of either systematic misunderstanding of how the universe works, or a systematic error in our estimation of the distance of distance objects or something similar (for instance, that some \"standard candle\" we're using isn't actually standard or is multiple kinds of objects, creating a systematic bias in our distance calculations which is creating the illusion of dark energy).",

Could there be things altering our ability to properly judge that data which we don't yet understand? If dark matter is an artifact of black holes, as I recall seeing some studies suggest fairly recently, is it not also comprehensible that our entire view of the CMBR, as well as visual and spectrographic observations, may be distorted (nearly uniformly from our relatively static POV) by lensing produced by a large universal population of black holes? I suppose that it is visible and obvious when we are looking at a black hole in close proximity to, or direct line of sight of a star, to see the lensing effect and confirm our predictions about how that single black hole distorts light. Would it be strictly obvious if, say, between here and Andromeda, were some potentially homogenous layer of black holes generating a cosmic mirage effect? I am reminded of the fact that Chicago is at times visible in the sky across the great lakes from Canada...",

They don't interact electromagnetically, so they do not absorb or reflect light, and they easily pass through other matter. Neutrinos don't have the right properties to account for most of the dark matter, so it is thought that there are similar particles yet to be directly detected that make up most of the mass of the galaxy.",

If that's the case, then yes, dark matter is everywhere. Trillions of neutrinos pass through your body every second, and these other dark matter particles would be passing through you all the time too.\n\nNo, we don't know of any way to interact with it other than through gravity, and their gravity is only noticeable on a large scale (all the dark matter within the orbit of Neptune would have about the mass of a small asteroid).\n\nWe do have an idea of its properties. This particle has mass and it doesn't interact with the electromagnetic force. The particles are slow enough to collect in galaxies, rather than radiating across the universe near the speed of light like neutrinos.",

So we assume there to be more mass, mass that we can't observe. Hence dark matter.",

Some force must be causing that.\"\n\nBut couldn't there be a simpler explanation that doesn't require some mysterious force?\n\nLike, what if photons/light just naturally lose energy over extreme distances?  Objects far away from us would appear redder because the photons lost some energy traveling here, and we can't test for it because the distances required to notice this energy loss are too great.\n\nI know that idea may go against some scientific principles that we accept as fact, but \"we were wrong, photons lose a tiny bit of energy over massive distances\" seems like such a simpler explanation than, \"there is a force that accounts for 70% of the universe's mass, and for some reason it causes the universe itself to expand faster and faster.

The idea also uses supernovae to get a more accurate judge of distance. I believe they can also make some inference in the age of galaxies due to other factors independent of red shift.

We can't see it directly or make any sense of it because it goes against all of our predictions, but it turns out what we see is the influence of *gravity*. Our science has no way to account for such a strange and large scale force though so they attribute it to hidden particles and other things that help solve the problem.

So the third peak is kind of a calibrator letting the first peak tells you how much matter there is.\n\nTo differentiate just the \"ordinary matter\" part, you can get that from the CMB too, but an even cooler way is by measuring how much of various atomic elements there are in the universe in little pockets that appear to have been pristinely left from the Big Bang. In these pockets, you see that something like 24% of the atoms are Helium-4. The amount of Helium-4 formed by the Big Bang depends really sensitively on how much ordinary matter there was, i.e. the ordinary atoms that are the building blocks of Helium. Run the math and that 24% number tells you about 5% of the universe is normal matter. Then 28%-5% and you get the part which is \"missing\", i.e. dark matter. \n\nAs for dark energy, well we've just measured how much matter there is (I actually cheated a bit above, those things tells you the total amount of matter, not the percentage relative to everything), so we can calculate how much all that matter gravitating in on itself should slow the expansion of the universe. Then you go and measure the expansion and find, lo-and-behold, not only is the expansion not slowing, its accelerating! Using supernovae as beacons to precisely measure the acceleration rate, you work out how much dark energy there is, giving you that 72% number.\n\nThere's probably like 10 other ways to measure these things than what I just described, cosmologists are constantly looking for new ways to do so and comparing the answers against each other, in hope to find a crack in the model pointing to some new things we don't understand!\n\n",

            "comment": "I actually wrote about this during the last bit of my degree in physics. I would link it to you but a) it\u2019s a bit complicated for non physicists and b) it\u2019s in spanish. So let me explain it as clear as I can:\n\nAs you may or may not know we use General Relativity to study cosmology. The usual model uses the FLRW solution to Einstein\u2019s field equations(EFE). This solution is used for a homogeneous and isotropic space-time (that basically means the contento of matter/energy is the same everywhere and in all directions). So the equations that stem from the EFE using this solution do not t fully describe the behavior of space-time, we need something else: A content inside this universe. For this the simplest model to use is a fluid (a perfect fluid, a fluid which has some properties that make it easier to use than a more real fluid). When you look at galaxies in a sufficiently big scale, they can be modeled using a perfect fluid. Now we can work using the EFE and the equation for the fluid to have a description of the evolution of the universe. \n\nSo suppose we have the usual stuff that we know: matter and light (yes, light can be modeled as a fluid). We do a study using these two fluids and... we arrive at the conclusion that the universe is expanding but it is expanding slower every time. But then we have a problem, we observe the universe and we find that the prediction of the model is wrong and the expansion of the universe is accelerating. We need more matter/energy in the universe for this to happen so we take another usual model called: \u039bCDM (a model with Cosmological Constant (or Dark Energy) and Cold Dark Matter) and we test it and we see that it makes a much better adjustment to the equations. From this we infer that we have around 30% of CDM and 70% of \u039b.\n\nYou might still be wondering how we arrive at these numbers, I haven\u2019t explained that yet. So now I\u2019ll do it.\n\nTo perform the studies I roughly mentioned above we use data from a particular type of supernovae: supernovae type Ia. This kind of supernovae emit a pretty standardized amount of light and energy. So the data used is something called \u201cdistance modulus\u201d it\u2019s some kind of comparison between absolute and apparent magnitudes (the apparent measures the brightness of the object how we perceive it and the other measures how bright it would be at 10 parcecs away from us). This quantity is linked with the distance by a little equation. And the other data needed is the reshift of the object (basically how far away it would be, or how \u201cred\u201d it\u2019s light appears to be due to its relative motion from us because of the expanding universe). We have this observational data captured from huge supernovae samplings. And we have the equations that give us a theoretical expression (an expression that has Dark Energy, CDM and redshift as parameters) for the distance modulus. \n\nNow for getting those numbers we need to make a statistical study if said data. We \u201ccompare\u201d the data with the theoretical input and try to minimize the difference with the observational data of the distance modulus of the supernovae. What we do is we sample a lot of values for Dark Energy and CDM and obtain a range of values using a Markov Chain in the Metropolis-Hastings method (at least that\u2019s what I did), obviously we use a computer for this. We input some arbitrary values for DE and CDM we make a comparison between the calculated distance modulus using these values and the observational data then we put some conditions that make the program make the decision if that value is useful or not and if it is it keeps it and if it\u2019s not it \u201cwalks a new step\u201d (that is it defines a new value for DE and CDM) and once again the program tests if these new values for DE and CDM are useful or not and so on until the program finishes the amount of steps we want it to take. We end up with a bunch of chains made of different values for DE and CDM. We plot some histograms and take the averages and what would you know, the averages are the 30% and 70% you know about. Does that mean that\u2019s what the universe is made of? No. In this case the averages are also the values of DE and CDM that are most likely in our universe. \n\n\nI hope this helps you understand a bit more on what is actually done in this type of research and I really hope you read my comment because it took me like half an hour or more to write. If you have any questions you can ask me and I\u2019ll gladly try to answer them.\n\nEdit: I messed up a bit (not counting all the typos) where I said you need a content for the EFE to be useful. That\u2019s not entirely true, once you have the perfect fluid (in this case) there\u2019s still something missing for the equations to be useful, we need more information about the fluid: the Equation of State. It\u2019s a relation between several thermodynamical properties but in the case of a simple fluid used in cosmology we only need an equation that relates the pressure of the fluid p and it\u2019s energy density \u03c1 (for example, for light I think it\u2019s p=1/3 \u03c1).",

            "comment": "There are several answers giving our estimate for dark matter within a galaxy using rotation curves, which is true.  But overall in the universe, our estimate comes from the scale of the fluctuations of energy density in the early universe.  The cosmic microwave background (CMB) is radiation left over from the period in the universe when the temperature finally fell just enough for electrons to join with nucleons to become atoms, and with no more free charged particles, photons became free to travel in the universe.  What we can do is look at the CMB radiation and map the scale of energy fluctuations over very large scales in the early universe.  There were several forces at play determining the shape of these fluctuations.  Gravitation tried to pull things together, whereas radiation pressure pushed things apart, and the curvature of the universe played a role.  If you plot the angular power spectrum of the CMB, as a functino of the multipole moment, you get a multi humped shape, and these humps gives us information about the shape of the universe (essentially flat, which gives us information about dark energy) and the ratio of matter not experiencing pressure (dark matter) to regular matter.  This is really where we get the estimates in percentages of dark matter, dark energy, and regular matter.",

            "comment": "Basically from gravitational equations.\n\nThe famous 'discovery' of dark matter is from astronomers measuring the rotational velocities of stars in a galaxy. \n\nWhen you look at planets orbiting the sun the inner planets orbit much faster than the outer planets. We expected to measure the same kind of difference in speeds of stars in a disc galaxy (like our own). We did not.\n\nInstead they found that the outer stars are basically going the same speed as the inner stars. Almost like the entire visible galaxy was actually set in an invisible sphere and the spheres' rotational velocity was essentially the rotational velocity for the entire system. (Think about one of those cool hand-blown glass marbles and how the designs inside all rotate around the center at the same rate).\n\nThe only solutions, mathematically, that fit the observed data are: our formula for gravity is wrong (it might be, but it's far too predictively accurate to be off by enough to account for these observations) or, there's a whole lot more mass than we can see in the system.\n\nBy 'can't see' scientists basically mean 'non-interacting' with other matter. So they crunch the numbers to figure out how much mass the dark matter is compared to normal matter (x% normal matter + y% dark matter = z rotational velocity). This is where the percentages come in and therein is the answer to your question.\n\nDark energy is a little different but also kind of similar. Instead of using gravitational measurements we made velocity measurements of red-shift (talking about the expansion of spacetime  with respect to entropy) and found our x% normal energies did not equal the z velocities that we observe. Again, crunch some numbers and solve for the unknown y% dark energy and bam.\n\nThere are a couple good documentaries on the idea around. YouTube has several good explanatory videos as well. I would recommend PBS Space Time, the host is a little cheesy but very informative.",

Does this imply that the dark matter is collected around those stars, rather than being evenly distributed across the galaxy? Is this also true at the galaxy level, that dark matter seems clumped around galaxies rather than distributed haphazardly? If so, would this imply that it was generated similarly to other matter and is just 'off the spectrum' of what humans can perceive?\n\nLastly, if it does imply dark matter is collected around those stars, why is the same not true at the planetary level to a lesser degree? i.e. why do we not see some effect on Jupiter/Saturn rotations?",

            "comment": "Imagine you have a big pool of water that is completely calm. If a single rain drop hits that pool is causes a [circular ripple](https://i.stack.imgur.com/fWFL6.jpg). By looking at how that ripple propagates through the water you can learn about the water. For instance, the pattern of the thicker circles and narrower circles tells us about the phase velocity and group velocity of water waves. Importantly (for the analogy), if you drop this pool of water (making it essentially weightless), you would remove the restoring force that makes the wave propagate and you would see the ripple stationary on the surface of water. \n\nNow imagine that there isn't just one rain drop, but many rain drops falling on the surface of the water. You drop this pool of water, making it weightless, and you see a messy pattern frozen on the surface caused by the interference of all the water waves with each other. But, if you take all the high points in this mess of water and  superimpose them on top of each other you would get an image that, on average, looks like single a circular ripple of water. You can then do the same analysis you would with a single drop of water to learn about the water itself. \n\nWe do a very similar analysis to find out the composition of the universe. At one point the universe was dense, and all the matter and energy was sloshing around inside an expanding universe. These are called baryon acoustic oscillations. However, at some point the universe cooled and became sparse enough that it stopped sloshing around because it couldn't interact with itself any more. The restoring force for the sloshing was removed, or the \"pool was dropped\". The remnants of this is called the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which is analogous to the frozen pattern of raindrops on our weightless pool. \n\nThe CMB is a measure of how much matter there is in a part of the universe. If you take all the hot spots (and cold spots), with lots of matter (and little matter), and superimpose them on top of each other we get a [pattern very similar to the ripples in water](http://inspirehep.net/record/1224727/files/Figs_spots_pol_stacks30.png). By studying the peaks of those patterns we can lean about the type of matter and energy that caused the ripple. In that image the measured data are on the top and the bottom is what we get from the best fit model (LCDM a model with cold dark matter and dark energy) that tells the the numerical values for the normal matter/dark matter/dark energy composition of the universe that you mention in your question. \n\nedit:  Force instance -&gt; For instance ",

The total matter density is measured directly from the power spectrum of the CMB and is 28.6% with visible matter only contributing 4.6%- the rest is in dark matter.

That means, in one orbit it goes 1.66 the distance Earth does.  But the actual time it takes is 1.88 years instead of 1.66 years.  That is because being farther from the Sun, Mars needs to go SLOWER to stay in its orbit (and not fall into the Sun or fly away).\n\nAt a galaxy level though, this is not what is observed.  The equivalent of Mars needs to go faster, and have a 1.66 years orbit instead of 1.88 years. It needs to go faster because there is more mass, and this mass is distributed weirdly (as if there was another part of the Sun somewhere between Earth and Mars).  This mass gives no light and does not seem to interact with regular matter in any way.  This is Dark Matter.\n\nDark Energy is more along the lines of  /r/blackmagicfuckery.  If you launch a rocket at 60 miles per hour, in 1 hour it would be at 60 miles away from you, in two hours it would be at 120 miles away, and so on.  But when galaxies do this, it goes from 60 miles after 1 hour, to 180 miles away in 2 hours.  Source of this is what we describe as Dark Energy.\n\nThe \"180 miles away in 2 hours\" and \"1.66 years orbit instead of 1.88\" gives us the 23% and 72% numbers.  (Actual numbers are not 180 or 1.66, but you get the idea).",

Maybe a few hundred years down the line we will know that what we see and know currently is nothing we compared to the reality. Maybe there's a lot more things than dark matter and dark energy ",

            "comment": "I believe those inferences come from the observed rotational velocity of galaxies being far beyond gravity field that observed matter could cause in the case of dark matter, and the apparent acceleration of the expansion of the universe seeming to run opposite of what mutual gravity of all objects including dark matter should cause, dark energy seems to be a repulsive force that overpowers gravity caused by both matter and dark matter on an intergalactic to cosmic scale.  That\u2019s my understanding I don\u2019t think the percentages are \u201caccurate\u201d but rather vigorous  estimates as accurate as possible.  The observed effects of dark matter and dark energy are correct, the existence of those two are not uncertain.  Nailing down exact percentages though most likely can not be done.  That\u2019s my basic understanding.",

That turned out to be unnecessary. The ether would exist uniformly everywhere. Dark matter on the other hand isn\u2019t a medium but a particle, and it\u2019s highly clumpy in where it appears. It has structure that changes over time. Clouds of dark matter collapse and rotate. So it explains different phenomena and has a bunch of qualities the ether was never thought to. ",

I'm wondering specifically how we got those particular numbers for them.\n\nWithout trying to be rude, I don't think you are aware. If you were, this question answers itself.\n\nDark matter for example is simply a name for of mass that we can't see inside a galaxy but we know must be there. We know it must be there because of how fast the galaxy is rotating, and how much gravity must therefore be present to cause it to rotate that fast (not enough gravity and everything would fly apart).\n\nIn other words that's how we learned dark matter exists in the first place. We calculated the amount of matter we can see and it's not 100% of the matter we know must be there because of the rotation, so the remaining percentage we say is dark matter.",

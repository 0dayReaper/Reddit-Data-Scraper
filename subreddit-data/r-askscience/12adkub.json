Something like creativity is associated in the right hemisphere. \n\nWould having to rely more on your right hemisphere for your source of sound make you more creative in that case?",

            "comment": "Some brain functions appear to be localized more to one brain hemisphere than the other, with language being the most prominent example: it seems to mostly reside in the left hemisphere. This is called \"lateralization\", and while it is a real thing that some neuroscientists study, it is nowhere near as dramatic as (bad) popular science media would have you believe. For most brain functions, there is at most a slight bias to one hemisphere over the other, but both sides are involved. It's also not the case (as is commonly suggested) that different hemispheres process information in a (substantially) different manner (e.g. that the left hemisphere would be more \"analytical\" while the right is more \"creative\"). \n\nMoreover, there is no good scientific basis to the idea that one can be more \"left-brained\" or \"right-brained\", or that you can do things to make your brain use one hemisphere more (e.g. \"I want to be more creative so I'm going to listen to this music which will 'activate' my right hemisphere\"). This is pure pseudoscience and you should not trust anyone or any source that takes this idea seriously. \n\nAs for hearing in particular: both ears are actually connected to the auditory cortex in both hemispheres. Also, the two hemispheres are strongly connected to each other, so the left auditory cortex \"talks\" to the right a great deal, and vice versa. Besides which, the brain, and especially the young developing cortex, is incredibly flexible. If you grow up deaf in one ear, the cortex will adapt to that.\n\nSo no, all in all, there is absolutely no reason to think that being deaf in your right ear will make you more creative, or process sound more creatively.",

Speech is harder for me to understand if people are my right side, which makes sense.  I have noticed a drop in my ability to understand speech in loud environments regardless of location, not really sure exactly why on that one.  Headphones sounded super messed up as first, but my brain has smoothed that one over in the last year and they sound pretty normal now.\n\nI'd say the weirdest thing is how messed up my sound placement can be now.  Most of my hearing loss was in the higher frequencies.  So high sounds, like a bird chirping or water trickling are just gone in that ear.  So to me, certain things happening on my right side, often sound like they are too my left, since that ear can still hear them.  It can be a little disconcerting sometimes.",

Timing is really what got me, it happened two days before Christmas 2021 when the hospitals were completely overrun with Covid patients.  In the span of about 3 hours I was fully deaf in that ear and basically couldn't stand and was vomiting.  The idea of going to the ER sounded horrendous so I just hoped it was the flu and went to bed.  Woke up feeling like 50% better, assumed it was the flu and carried on.\n\nDid a telehealth visit day after christmas, was told I was fine and take meds for vertigo, which I didn't bother with (note to self, telehealth is COMPLETELY useless unless you just need a RTW form).  Week later still was having issues, was finally able to see a real doctor and they figured out what happened. They tried steroids and stuff but by then it was too late, the nerve damage was done and it was permanent.  If I had be given steroids the night my symptoms first appeared, I probably would have made a full recovery.  Whenever I get health insurance again ill probably get another opinion somewhere on if anything else can be done, but it's not a huge priority for me, my balance is fine now so im functional lol.",

Lots of loud engine sound and implement sound. In some cases with an unmuffled V4 engine. Number 3 was exposure to a lot of sound with 30 years of having noisy fans and such.\n\nThe first time I went to see what could be done, if anything, and the doctor told me that I was able hear better when I could see the person speaking (unconsciously learned to kind of lip read).",

            "comment": "While you don't have specific detectors for water molecules, you have detectors for pressure, temperature, the smoothness and roughness of objects, slipperiness, etc. \n\nSo while you're not detecting water molecules themselves, you're detecting a typical pattern of pressure, temperature and smoothness, that your brain recognizes as \"wet\". Your vision also helps; if you can visibly see it's wet, that'll help your brain feel wetness. \n\nSince we can't actually sense water molecules and we sense a pattern of temperature and pressure instead, some objects can give an illusion of wetness when touched blindly; certain types of cold metal objects for example.",

I was listening to a podcast (Stuff you should know, I can't recall the episode), and during one of their side conversation they mentioned that we humans don't actually have the specific sensors to perceive moisture. This is why, for example, when you hang clothes to dry outside on a chilly day and then bring them in, you won't be able to tell if the clothes have actually dried yet or if they're just cold. They feel wet but could be completely dry, we can't know until we wait for them to warm up a bit.",

But many receptors together form a combined signal and our brain goes: hey I know this, we labeled this _flower_\n\nSame with feeling things.",

For example, once you dive into the ocean, your face gets engulfed by water =&gt; your body reacts to it by inhibiting breathing (spinal cord level) so you don\u2019t breath in water. \nThis is just an example, but regarding your question, perceiving something isn\u2019t just what you feel, but also what you see, hear and smell. All these things are connected in the brain to have us form a conclusion as to what we are feeling and touching. \n\nThere are also many different receptors on our skin that help us feel vibration, temperature, and pressure, which are connected to neurons to the brain. Coming into contact with water activates these receptors.",

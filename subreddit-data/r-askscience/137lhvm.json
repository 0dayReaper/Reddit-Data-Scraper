            "comment": "When a star absorbs a planet, it usually happens due to the planet's orbit decaying over time, leading it to move closer to the star. The process of a star absorbing a planet can be broken down into several steps:\r  \n\r  \nThe planet enters the star's Roche limit: The Roche limit is the point at which tidal forces from the star become stronger than the planet's own gravitational forces. When a planet enters the Roche limit, it starts to experience tidal forces that can cause it to break apart.\r  \n\r  \nThe planet is tidally disrupted: As the planet approaches the star, the tidal forces exerted by the star become stronger, causing the planet to become elongated and eventually break apart. This process is known as tidal disruption.\r  \n\r  \nThe planet's material is heated: As the planet's material is tidally disrupted, it starts to heat up due to frictional forces. This can cause the planet's material to ionize and emit radiation.\r  \n\r  \nThe planet's material falls towards the star: The material that was once part of the planet now starts to fall towards the star due to the star's gravity. As the material falls towards the star, it heats up even further and can start to emit X-rays and other high-energy radiation.\r  \n\r  \nThe material accretes onto the star: The material from the planet eventually reaches the star and is accreted onto its surface. The accretion process can cause the star's brightness to increase temporarily due to the additional energy being released.\r  \n\r  \nThe remnants of the planet may form a debris disk: After the planet has been absorbed by the star, the remaining debris can form a disk around the star. This debris disk can sometimes be observed using telescopes and can provide insight into the planet's composition and structure.\r  \n\r  \nThe process of a star absorbing a planet is a violent and destructive event that can have a significant impact on the star's properties and surrounding environment.",

                    "comment": "The roche limit is based on the relative density of the star and the planet. Expanding stars are generally not that dense aside from the core, in the case of a red giant and a rocky planet the roche limit is deep inside the star.\n\nIn this case the planet would stay together while its orbit decays into the star. \n\nOnce it hits the photosphere it's like a meteor hitting an atmosphere. I really can't say what would happen then, maybe it would break apart maybe it would slow down and sink like a rock.",

I was curious about what happened to a rocky planet\u2019s mass when I read the news article about an observation of a likely absorption by a star.\n\nAs a person not involved in science, I had a hard time picturing a ***rocky mass*** blown or melted into another state of matter",

            "comment": "If it's a big planet the gas would be ripped off so would the outer layer only the rocky outer layer and the core would remain and would also be consumed by the star eventually,  If it's small it would get vaporised and become part of the outer layer of the star. It really depends on a few things like size and composition but ultimately the star would absorb it.",

            "comment": "Hm... There's not a detailed answer here yet, so I guess I'll jump in.\n\nFirst thing to realize: in reach retina, there's over 100 million photoreceptors, but only 1 million axons in the optic nerve. How's that work? The answer, is that it's completely accurate to say that the earliest part of visual processing is in the eye. There's 5 layers to the retina. The million ganglion cells sending the optic nerve to central command, a middle 'processing' layer with three main types of interneurons, and the actual photoreceptor cell layer (the other two layers are 'in between' layers made up of the cabling connecting these three cell body layers).\n\nThere's actually about 20 different kinds of ganglion cells, so you can look at it as there being 20 different image filters sent in to central. Some with blue/yellow contrast, others for pure luminance contrast, etc. Some of these 'views' have very tiny 'receptive fields' (the part of the retina their signal contains information for). So-called 'P' ganglions for example can have one single cone that causes them to depolarize and fire, though they all have surrounding parts/colors that inhibits firing. Each ganglion cell actually has a fairly complex 'optimal' pattern that makes them fire... Usually either 'light in the center, dark on the edges', the reverse of that, or a color version (blue light but no yellow light, for example). So even by the time the signal's leaving the eye, you're already getting various size views containing different kinds of contrast information. It should be said too, the closer to the fovea (center of the view) the smaller the receptive field gets, so the more detail you can perceive... So the 'resolution' of your view is actually not consistent even just across the eye.\n\nAnyway. So: the optic nerve. These million axons aren't sending pixel information, they're sending 20 pictures, each with larger or smaller receptive fields depending on type and distance from the fovea, and different activation patterns they're 'looking for' to fire. This tract splits off on the way to the central switchboard (the LGN in the thalamus). For the left hemisphere of the LGN (say), you get the right eye's ear half of the view, and the left eye's nose half of the view. Opposite that for the right hemisphere.\n\nSo, the left hemisphere switchboard gets input from the right half of the visual field. But these two views don't perfectly line up... Maybe 80% of that view does, but the most peripheral part of the view only gets a signal from the outside edge, not the nose-side edge, so your peripheral vision doesn't have a binocular signal to put together in the first place.\n\nInput from different eyes is totally separate still in this central switchboard. Each hemisphere's LGN has 6 main layers, 3 from each eye, with thin middle layers in between carrying the comparatively small amount of color information (koniocellular layers), also still separated by eye. \n\nAmong other places (pupil and eye muscle autonomic circuits in particular) this tract then gets sent to the primary visual cortex in V1, at the very back of your head. Here, it's still separated by eye. You've got these stripes running from the back to the front, with alternating left eye, right eye input. Perpendicular to that, you've got simple edge detectors going through different orientations, and mixed into all that, you've got these barrel shaped blobs of cells that respond to color information. You can see a picture of what I mean [here](http://what-when-how.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/tmp3661_thumb1.jpg). One 'cycle' of left eye/right eye, and 180 degrees of orientation preference for edges marks out a roughly 1mm x 1mm 'hypercolumn', that takes in input from a chunk of the retina. These hypercolumn are the basic processing unit here in V1, and they tile over the visual field. The receptive field here is larger than a single cone or rod certainly, but it's still fairly small. You can see that the same parts of the visual field are at least nearby now though, that's what those stripes are... Lined up regions from the same part of the visual field from different eyes.\n\nOnce it gets to V2, the next layer of processing, this is where you start to have 'binocular integration', neurons that selectively fire based on visual input from both eyes.\n\nAs you climb up in levels, you'll see larger and larger receptive fields. By the time you get deep into the ventral visual stream (very loosely speaking, ventral stream is identifying things you're seeing, dorsal stream is for helping to guide hands and stuff for grabbing things and so on) you're seeing cells that selectively fire given complex input from anywhere in the visual field. A 'Jennifer Aniston' neuron for example that might fire anytime you're seeing her face... Or her name written, or a drawing of her, or so on, from anywhere in the visual field.\n\nBut anyway. You get the gist. The full complex view of even the early visual system is hilariously intricate, and there's no really simple description that captures all the detail. But maybe a partway answer that's close enough... Peripheral vision has no binocular component, since only one eye captures that outside edge. For the bulk of your visual field though, yes... Things get tied together eventually, but it's not until V2... After many layers of processing in the retina, LGN, and V1. By then, you're talking about receptive fields with hundreds of input photoreceptors, and you're already talking about integrating signals for fairly high level information... Direction of movement, edge orientations, color information and so on, all in separate parallel feeds, to be integrated into even more high level, abstract tracts of information with even larger receptive fields as you continue climbing up towards the dorsal (hand eye coordination) and ventral (object recognition) tracts.\n\nNote too: every step here is more tightly interconnected than I'm describing. In particular, there's 10x connections coming BACKWARDS from downstream than there are coming in from upstream towards the retina, so you probably do have some binocular signal affecting neuron firing even before you get to the binocular integration part in V2. Those incredibly numerous backpropagating connections aren't well understood, but it does definitely complicate the question of where you can start pointing to neurons influenced by input from both eyes in the same part of the visual field. \n\nSo anyway... There you go, haha. This is largely cobbled together from Kandel's 'principles of Neuroscience, 6th edition', there's a half dozen chapters in the low 20's going through how the brain processes visual information in pretty heavy detail.",

The key word they used was 'inspired'. I tried to dig up the origin of convolutional image kernels, and while I couldn't find much in five minutes of digging, I'm sure you're right, that they predate deep learning certainly, and possibly even digital computing entirely given that their historical origin was probably in signal processing.\n\nTheir comment though wasn't whether or not CNNs directly imitate biology, or that the way they did it was entirely novel... They were just pointing out that biology was an inspiration for trying it this way, and that part's unambiguously true. To my knowledge, the first paper introducing the phrase 'convolutional neural network' was from Yann LeCun. [This one](https://github.com/Yorko/deep_learning_python_intro/blob/master/papers/LeCun%20backpropagation%20applied%20to%20handwritten%20zip%20code%20recognition.pdf) I believe, from 1989. If you look at the references, you'll note Hubel and Wiesel's 1962 paper introducing a crude model of biological vision processing is in the references. More importantly, Fukushima, 1980 is referenced (and mentioned in the text as a direct inspiration). This 'Neocognitron' is generally accepted to be the first proto-CNN. The architecture is a bit different than we're used to, but it's where things started... And as the author puts it in the abstract:\n\n&gt; A neural network model for a mechanism of \nvisual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. \nThe network is self-organized by \"learning without a \nteacher\", and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus \npatterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) \nof their shapes without affected by their positions. This \nnetwork is given a nickname \"neocognitron\". After \ncompletion of self-organization, the network has a \nstructure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual \nnervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. \n\nSo... Yes. CNNs weren't inspired by cow vision or something... Hubel and Wiesel's most famous work involved experiments on kittens. but CNN origins are unambiguously tied into Hubel and Wiesel's work in biological visual processing, so the person you're responding to is actually the one that was right. I just noticed even, some of the papers referenced from Wikipedia that you said didn't show biological inspiration are the same ones I mentioned even, so they were the correct papers to cite.\n\nIf I may be a bit rude for my own Sunday morning amusement: 'Thanks for being interested, but there is a lot of fluffery in ML discussions.'\n\nSeriously though, it's an interesting topic for sure, and historical image processing techniques are certainly equally important to the history of CNNs... They were the tool reached for given the biological inspiration, so in all seriousness you're not entirely wrong from another perspective, even if you're not justified in shooting down a biological inspiration.",

I bet that'd be an interesting thing to find out about even, maybe eventually brain scan technology will be cheap and powerful enough that you could look into it for a lark:).\n\nThat book mentioned that approximately 50% of the brain (or 50% of the cortex at least?) Is dedicated to vision, and there's evidence I guess for tissue that'd normally take on one function to end up doing something else if the normal input feed's down for some reason. With only half the visual input coming in when you were that young, seems like that's a lot of computational hardware that's freed up for something else. Maybe you've got some only vaguely noticed superpower you'd be surprised other people don't have, who knows?\n\nEdit: one last thing you might find interesting. Elsewhere in this thread actually, there was a discussion about biological inspiration behind convolutional neural networks from the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The inspiration was from Hubel and Wiesel, two really foundational Neuroscience researchers in the late 1950's and 1960's. They won the Nobel prize for their work, one critical experiment of which involved keeping one eye of a kitten closed and seeing how it changed their development. I don't know the details of their findings, but given the historical significance of that research, I bet your case actually has a lot of understanding behind it. Just wondering out loud more than sharing anything specific, but interesting that Hubel and Wiesel more or less came up in two comment threads here.",

Those conditions are that the the physical point is at the same distance as the vergence distance of the two eyes (in other words, where they are both 'pointing', taking the axis of an eye to be a line between the center of the pupil and the foveola of the retina).\n\nUnder those conditions, a point in physical space will be imaged on precisely corresponding positions in the two retinas, and then I suppose it's fine to think of those as \"the same positions\".\n\nYou get the finest depth information, about the smallest differences in depth, from slightly different inputs both from the \"same\" i.e. precisely corresponding positions. The coarser the spatial grain (i.e. the more spread out in space it is), the larger the depth it can signal. So coarser depth signals will be transmitted by neurons with larger receptive fields, and potentially also by neurons with looser or less precise binocular correspondence. but I think the general rule will be that binocular neurons are for corresponding positions, and lack of precision amounts to noise, not a special source of information in itself.",

When it comes down to it, binocular correspondence is as precise as the location of photoreceptors in the retina, at least this is true for central (foveal) vision, it might be less precise than that in the periphery.\n\nBut.. when it comes to binocular correspondence, the correspondence isn't *really* between receptors or pixels (\"points\") in the retina - starting with the optic nerve, visual neurons have \"receptive fields\" that cover a fuzzy region (but still clearly localized) of the retina. So correspondence isn't technically between *points* but between *areas*.\n\nBut those areas are at many scales, and I tell you it gets really complicated really fast when you look at it closely: pick a point in the binocular visual field (like, look at a single pixel on your screen). This point, if small enough, might fall on a single photoreceptor in each eye - photoreceptors at \"corresponding positions\". But the correspondence is being encoded, in the brain, by many many many neurons with receptive fields of different sizes, all of which overlap that point.\n\nI guess this can suggest to you how to think about binocular correspondence. There is a tiny point of light shining out in space, and you look at it. Certain monocular neurons (in each eye, and downstream from there all the way to primary visual cortex) are excited by this point of light. Starting in primary visual cortex (and especially after that) there will be *binocular* neurons that are excited by that point, and that would be excited by it *even if one eye were closed* (meaning, they \"want\" a specific point in space, regardless of which eye it came from). That is, those binocular neurons are encoding the same point in space, and this is the basis of binocular correspondence.\n\nIf you move the point of light over so that it excites a different set of receptors, then the downstream activity will also shift, and some different neurons will be excited. But there will be overlap: some binocular neurons will be excited by both positions (they have \"large receptive fields\") but some will be more selective, excited only by one position or another. So not only is there binocular correspondence encoded, but it is multiscale - there is correspondence between points of many sizes.",

Keep in mind that the lens of the eye flips the image.  Top of visual field becomes bottom of retina, left becomes right, etc.  So the signals for a particular point in your visual field end up on different neurons.  The brain then synthesizes the image.

    "postText": "Apologies if this is the wrong tag, I was torn between biology and chemistry and medicine.\n\nI understand that the mechanism behind washing with soap and water as an effective pathogen control mechanism is a combination of friction, water washing things away, surfactants lifting oils (and anything mixed in) off the surface down with the water, and the breaking of lipid layers that enclose many pathogens. \n\nI have eczema and am looking for options that are less likely to aggravate the condition, and these \"soap free\" cleansers keep coming up, as well as things with \"gentle surfactants\" like Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate. \n\nMy question is, do the differences between these products reduce the effectiveness of handwashing? Say, after using the toilet or handling raw meat, would such a thing be an appropriate swap for normal   liquid hand soaps?",

So, SCI should work just fine on pathogens while being mild to the skin.",

I have a similar, rated question: given that adding literally anything to DI water has change the bonding, and therefore surface tension, of the water molecules, isn't basically everything technically a surfactant? Is there a specified change in bonding energy that needs to happen for a compound to be considered a surfactant? Or am I missing something obvious?",

                            "comment": "Changing surface tension is not actually the key property of a surfactant.  Rather, it is \"surface action\", or a tendency to migrate to the interface and interact with both phases.  Surfactants form both a monolayer at the water-air interface and micelles at the water-oil interface.  There are more complicated examples as well, but that's the gist.\n\nEthanol for example lowers the surface tension of water and slightly increases water-oil activity, but does not behave like a surfactant in either of those ways.\n\nThere is no technical definition for soap, it's just a colloquial term.  I would see no issue with calling SCI a soap.",

A shampoo works in different conditions than a laundry detergent or a spray cleaner.\n\nProperties must also be tuned to play nicely with other ingredients in the product, and for consumer safety.  Cost and source reliability are also factors.",

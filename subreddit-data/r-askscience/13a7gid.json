            "comment": "There are various ways. One of them is subjective tests - asking people directly when their earliest memory occurs. Oftentimes it's around this age. Now the issue with such tests is that memories are not stagnant. There's a process known as [reconsolidation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22877586/), where every time the memory is recalled it becomes malleable again. This means that the brain alters the memory - tweaks it, emphasizing details and under-emphasizing others, sometimes including things from the context in which you recall it. What occurs that over time the memory of a certain time is changed from what actually happened, and what you actually experienced. Parents or other older people telling you stories about you at that age can unintentionally be incorporated into the memory - create a false version of the memory if you will, and you think it actually happened or happened that way. \n\nThere are also other processes that for smoothness of recall, mesh a bunch of memories together so that when you recall a general idea or a process, it becomes easier to remember. You don't remember every multiple choice test you've taken, but if someone sat you down right now to take one you know that you have to circle one choice, any strategies to select the best one, so forth. That's this process at play. So a memory of you as a young toddler might not correspond to that age, but could be a mesh of different experiences of your early childhood.\n\nOther more direct testing occurs in the form of putting toddlers to the test to recall long term memories. Research in memory formation has been done since children are babies. They involve priming task - testing response to images that are either pre-exposed or represent something familiar. This gets better with age. Toddlers and older kids start recalling familiarity to stimuli from a certain age. Before that, whatever babies are exposed to doesn't really last long enough to be considered a conscious memory. \n\nOther tests - involving showing babies patterns and seeing if they are interested in the novel (what scientists expected they'd be more interested in) vs. the usual pre-exposed stimuli found that babies are more drawn to the novel stuff. Around 6-7 months they are able recall the difference between novel and usual stuff for weeks. Older babies (a year old) it lasts longer, and toddlers and children are able to recall the task for months. There are longitudinal studies that found that older people are able to recall exposure to things over years. The timeframe where this starts is around 3 years. This correlates with brain development in the temporal lobe at this point in  - important for memory formation and retention.",

I was curious as to how a more objective test could be done outside of just asking people how far back they remember. The upcoming generation will have so many pictures and videos of their childhood that I think it would be much more difficult for them to tell if a memory is \u201creal\u201d or prompted by pictures they have seen.",

                            "comment": "Yes I would say that's a valid concern. At the same time though, a lot of stimuli would probably be forgotten or simply go without encoding it (that is, the brain doesn't bother to put it into long term). There have been concerns about children's overexposure to online stimuli and how [that's messing with their attention spans](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35430923/) for example, which in turn influences how well they're able to recall things later. It's still to early to tell, but I think it's a net negative. \n\nI'll say the concept of false memories has always been a thing. Whether or not technology would worsen that needs more study but studies have shown that those who are not educated about these things are at more often [victim to negative self image in response to exposure to photo-filtering (which alters body and face to fit a beauty ideal for example) than those who are educated about it](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10964-016-0440-3).

            "comment": "by memory you mean \"autobiographical memory\" - the phenomenon where autobiographical memory seems to extend only back to age 2 (at earliest) is called \"childhood amnesia\".\n\nthe cause of this is unknown. it's thought that it's not coincidental that the timing of childhood amnesia is connect with the onset of significant language development, the growing ability to have conversations (e.g. with parents) about \"what happened\".\n\nso while toddlers definitely have memories of what's happened, that early style of autobiographical memory seems to be replaced with a more language-based style. but the process isn't very well understood.\n\nwe know it's happening in part from personal experience. but you can easily test a child (or an adult) about things from very early childhood, to reveal that they don't remember e.g. that they had a dog that died with they were 18 months old; or the birth of a sibling when they were 2yo; or the color of the house they lived in before they moved at age 1. etc etc.\n\none widely-cited study of this kind is by Usher &amp; Neisser (1993):\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20190302064842id_/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/97fe/86a08e6f8fdfd9ccb3ab06f7cb8d8adeb0c9.pdf\n\nIn that study the experimenters recruited college students, obtained accounts of significant early-life event; for many subjects (those that agreed), their mothers were then contacted and asked to evaluate the students' accounts (for claimed memories) to judge accuracy. the results support the notion that these kinds of reportable memories don't extend back further than age 2 or 3.",

I actually thought of this question when reading about childhood amnesia and wondering what research it may have been based on. \n\nI also have always felt like I have a really poor memory of childhood and certainly don\u2019t remember anything from even 3 or 4 years old. It got me thinking: is there anyone on the opposite end of the spectrum who has memories from, say, infancy? And how could we prove or disprove it?",

Even in the study I linked, you can see that there are some claims to recall events from the first year; but it's possible (or likely) that these memories are secondary, developed from hearing stories or looking at pictures in early childhood. In that study they tried to test this (by also asking subjects if they remembered hearing stories or seeing pictures about queried events), but the result was inconsistent (some signs that individuals who didn't remember pictures/stories did not report such early memories; some did). To prove/disprove such extreme early memories, you'd need a lot more data than this (and this isn't my area, so I can't point to much more literature than classic studies like this).",

Theres studies that show babies forming memories in their frist weeks and others claim years. Main reason is that people dont agree on how you can tell, how to measure/confirm.... its all speculation honestly.",

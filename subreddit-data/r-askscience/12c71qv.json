If you're diagnosed at stage 2 (of 4) or later, there's nothing doctors can do for you and you're just going to die. If you're diagnosed at stage 1... well, you're probably still going to die tbh, but there's at least stuff doctors can attempt.",

Got my titers checked. No immunity whatsoever to varicella. It's as if I've never encountered it before.\n\nApparently I'm what they call a \"non-responder\". On one hand, I'll never get shingles. On the other, I can get chicken pox again, again, and again. And I feel like it's worse each time, so far.\n\nMy boss says that from now on, I am to NOPE right out of treating, transporting, or even coming into contact with any patients with shingles, and if anyone presses the issue, to save time, I am to just tell the hospital staff that I'm pregnant (cuz pregnant caregivers are expressly forbidden from working with active shingles patients). And it is much easier than having to explain myself every time. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nWe looked into PPE for people like me.

The immune system tries to fight the infection by producing antibodies against the virus but is ineffective in completely eliminating it from the brain cells.\n\n4. Over time, the immune response weakens, and the virus reactivates, causing recurrent cycles of inflammation and damage to brain cells.\n\n5. The ongoing inflammation and damage lead to gradual destruction of the brain tissue, resulting in neurological symptoms such as seizures, vision changes, muscle spasticity, and cognitive decline.\n\n6. The disease progresses slowly over several years, and there is no cure for SSPE. In summary, a latent or persistent measles virus infection in the central nervous system can lead to SSPE due to recurrent cycles of inflammation and damage brain cells, which eventually results in the progressive destruction of the brain tissue.",

So your body just dies, one cell at a time, gradually killing certain systems of your body faster than others. Fast replicating systems include your immune system, bone marrow, stomach lining, liver cells, and others. So you can\u2019t fight infection, your stomach can\u2019t protect itself from its own acid, and your body gradually loses the ability to clear toxins from your blood.

There are many where the only treatments are symptomatic therapies (making the symptoms a little better) but there are no disease modifying therapies. Sooo many examples but a few are Huntington's disease (genetic condition that leads to brain degeneration and death due to Huntington's in 100% of impacted individuals), many genetic variations that are not compatible with life (meaning if a pregnancy does make it to birth, the baby will die within hours/days of birth 100% of the time) \n\nAre you excluding causes that can't be treated due to extremely low likelihood of identifying the disease/condition in time to treat? I saw a bananas case of [ultra rare brain eating amoeba](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24485-brain-eating-amoeba) that sadly wasn't identified until after the patient died. So it can be possible to try rapidly going through a work up to figure out what's wrong with someone, but there may be no to very low chance of figuring out what's wrong with enough time to still have any meaningful chance of someone surviving.",

There is a treatment (surgery to remove a max of infected/necrotic tissues and Amphotericine, plus reduction of immunosuppressive therapy in transplanted patients, when possible). The mortality is still very high, but we can at least try something! \nActually, we had a pretty high rate of survival for mucor, because after the first 2 cases (that were concurrent) we started to suspect it (and then find it and treat it) early!",

If I recall the tumor may have been benign or a type that was unlikely to recur. She had brain surgery, all was good. But then she developed mucormycosis and they aggressively treated her with anti fungals and I think ivig to boost her immune system. She spent probably a decade of surgery after surgery to remove portions of her sinuses, the base of her skull, portions of her jaw bone, her hard and soft palate. Once she finally cleared it then the reconstructive surgeries started. Bone grafts, muscle grafts, rebuilding her jaw and the roof of her mouth. And on and on. Simply unimaginable what she went through. After all of that, she has now suffered repeated strokes and has seizures. She\u2019s lucky she survived at all but I can\u2019t imagine enduring all of that. No recurrence of cancer, so there\u2019s that I guess.",

The largest explosion sent a vessel fragment flying 2,000 feet across the Schuylkill River.[1] Five employees sustained minor injuries, but there were ultimately no fatalities. The refinery announced it would shut down operations the same month, and filed for bankruptcy a month later.[2]",

Without that medical support you have a 100% chance of dying from it.\n\nSomething that hospitals cannot do anything about at the moment are any of the prion related diseases - all of which are currently 100% fatal.  Prions are thought to be the primary cause of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, cystic fibrosis, Gaucher's disease and many other degenerative and neurodegenerative disorders.  There is hope in research being done using mRNA to teach the immune system to recognise and destroy the misfolded proteins that are thought to be behind these diseases.",

If it comes in contact with you (and you're aware of it), there's basically nothing you can do besides amputating that area (fairly quickly). If you're not aware of it, then symptoms slowly develop and there's nothing you can do.",

Dimethylmercury is the best known and is really nasty because it penetrates latex and PVC, is readily absorbed through the skin, and can take months for symptoms to show up. There are treatments if you know you were exposed and seek medical attention immediately. \n\nPlease don't incorporate impromptu dismemberment into your lab safety procedures.",

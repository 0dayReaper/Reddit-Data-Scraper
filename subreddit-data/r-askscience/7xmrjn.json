            "comment": "Short answer: maybe, maybe not. No one is sure. \n\nLonger answer: The alphabet we use today is something that evolved over ~3,000 years, through 4 iterations minimum: \n\nPhoenician \u21d2 Greek \u21d2 Latin \u21d2 modern languages with letters like J, W, and \u00df, as well as diacriticals like \u00e5 and diphthongs like \u0153. \n\nAs a result, there\u2019s no one answer for where the order for a given modern language comes from. The alphabet for English is different from that of French, or Swedish, or Polish. Consider the Hungarian alphabet, which looks like this:\n\na, \u00e1, b, c, cs, d, dz, dzs, e, \u00e9, f, g, gy, h, i, \u00ed, j, k, l, ly, m, n, ny, o, \u00f3, \u00f6, \u0151, p, q, r, s, sz, t, ty, u, \u00fa, \u00fc, \u00fb, v, w, x, y, z, zs\n\nNow, we can look at that and see that the basic order of the Latin alphabet remains. The additions are just stuck in after the related letters whose sounds they modify. As with English, we have the Latin alphabetical order, plus the later medieval insertions of j and w. The insertions are obvious and easy, because they simply follow the letters they were invented to modify/clarify. \n\nBut for the Latin order, it\u2019s trickier. Latin is a blend of Etruscan and Greek, and they adopted neither wholesale. For example, Etruscan had 3 letters for what we would think of a \u2018k\u2019 sounds today: C, Q, and K (probably \u2018kay\u2019, \u2018qoo\u2019 and \u2018ka\u2019 but this is a guess since Etruscan remains untranslated). G was a lesser-used sound in Etruscan, but /k/ was very important, so they invented C from G, swapped kappa and gamma in the order, then inserted the \u2018other\u2019 k sound further down the line from \u03d8 or qoppa , a pre-standardized Greek letter used in some cities. \n\nLong story short, there\u2019s some interesting linguistics research that suggests certain groupings of letters were created intentionally by different groups at different times, and then just kept out of habit by adopters. \n\nSo for example, the Beth Gimel Dat sequencing mentioned in a number of other posts was adopted directly into Greek as Beta Gamma Delta, but then the Gamma was replaced with C in Latin. \n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger!",

Or was it the ancient equivalent of some modern journal articles, that are of interest to no one outside their field, read by few in it, and ultimately of interest to fewer than 100 people alive? That is, was it actually an amazing repository of knowledge on the Etruscans, or simply hundreds of pages of overwritten tripe that no one could be bothered to recopy by hand?",

                            "comment": "To add to u/whistleridge's response, another thing is that translation doesn't work like laypeople (especially media) seems to think it does. You more or less *can't* get a translation without *already having one*. For living languages, this comes from people you can interact with - I can point to a rock or mimic sleeping to try and get words for those things, and eventually be at a place where I have the vocabulary to ask about nuances of meaning or get clarifications.\n\nFor dead languages, though, you pretty much *need* a bilingual text to get you started. Linguists can also try comparing with already-known languages to see if things happen to line up, and if they do can sometimes deduce *some* meaning that way. However, there's plenty of problems with words that aren't directly translated - see [hapax legomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapax_legomenon), where even in known languages a word may be unknown in meaning, because we only have a single recorded instance of it.\n\nSo without *some* kind of external source for what something means, it's impossible to translate.  For example, if I give you the sentence &lt;daeklet ufkunis i\u014blo'sat \u014boqo&gt;, no one would ever be able to deduce what it means from just that. I could give you dozens of examples, a novel, an entire library. It has a working grammar, but it's ultimately something I made up, and without some kind of context to get things started it wouldn't be possible to actually translate. Best-case, someone who knows what they're doing would be able to pick out *some* of the morphology and syntax, but nearly 100% of lexical words and the vast majority of grammatical words you wouldn't be able to determine the meaning of.  You *need* bilingual texts that more-or-less spell out exactly what the words means in order to get anywhere.",

Semitic vowels shift regularly in how the word is being used, eg tense, mood, etc. As such they were not so important and were not used in the Phoenician.\n\nHow the Greeks invented letters for vowels is interesting: Phoenician had some consonant sounds the Greeks did not have, so the Greeks heard 'only' the vowel sound of essentially the second letter of the name of the letter. They therefore interpreted several Phoenician consonants as vowels and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nEDIT: spelling",

However, he thought about the alphabet (A-B-C-D), realized that earlier organizations, like in Hebrew, had Bet-Gimel-Daleth (B-G-D), which are phonetically related, and so it might not be arbitrary. This sent him off on a research quest trying to figure it out.",

The Southern Semitic order is still reflected today in the Ethiopian Ge'ez script.

Cultural dominance probably played much more of a role than any innate property; the Phoenicians happened to use Northern Semitic order, so the Greeks happened to keep more or less the same order when they adopted the Phoenician alphabet.\n\nThe same question is often asked about [writing directionality](https://imgur.com/a/GUJ4s) among other things, but as this chart shows, current dominance of a linguistic property doesn't necessarily mean that dominance was inevitable (or even foreseeable).",

Russian, Swahili, and any other language using a Greek- or Latin-descended alphabet will most likely have the same basic order with A at the beginning, so those don't really count as independent data points. (Also I believe the first letter in both Korean *ganada* orders is g/k.)\n\nThat said, there is definitely a certain logic to thinking of either the glottal stop, a velar stop (g or k), an inherent [schwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa) (the vowel sound in an unstressed \"the\"), or the open unrounded vowel (a as in \"cat\") as the 'first' or most basic letter in your phoneme inventory, if one thinks of the back of the vocal tract as where sound 'begins' (which in a sense it does).\n\nIn fact this is exactly how the Indic alphabetical order (*[var\u1e47am\u0101l\u0101](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari#Letters)*, lit. \"garland of letters\") was organized: if one imagines speech sounds proceeding in order from the back of the vocal tract to the front, vowel (or glottal) sounds are first, velar consonants (k, g, ng) next, then palatal (ch, j, \u00f1 as in Spanish \"ma\u00f1ana\"), followed by [retroflex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retroflex_consonant) (consonants with the tongue curled back against the palate that give Indian languages their characteristic sound), then alveolar/dental (t, d, n) and labial (p, b, m). This is actually one of the reasons the syllable [Om](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Om#Origin_and_meaning) is considered sacred in Dharmic religions. It's analysed as a+u+m and said to signify the beginning (a), middle (u), and end (m) of creation, from the back to the front of the vocal tract.\n\nThe [Brahmic scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmic_scripts#Characteristics) are mostly abugidas, i.e. each 'letter' usually represents a consonant+vowel combination, and standalone consonants are usually assumed to take an inherent vowel (usually a short \"a\" pronounced as schwa). Given that most Japanese kanas also represent a consonant+vowel combination and [Japanese derived its kana order from Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goj%C5%ABon#History), it stands to reason that short \"a\" would be their first 'letter' as well.\n\nThe logic of beginning your alphabet at the back of the vocal tract even holds for Korean hangul, whose first letter is g/k, and for Ethiopian Ge'ez, whose first letter is h, a glottal consonant.\n\nSo I think your point makes a lot of sense. The main difference might simply be whether one's language has a phonemic glottal stop or not, in which case one hears either the glottal stop beginning the sound of the open vowel (and thus the alphabet), or the open vowel sound itself.",

Hebrew/Aramaic and Arabic are more directly descended from Phoenician. In a sense, almost every alphabet/abjad/abugida in use today originated with the Ugaritic alphabet (which may have been influenced by the Egyptian use of some heiroglyphs to represent phonemes). Even much later alphabets such as Korean hangul may have been informed by the *existence* of Phoenician-descended Brahmic scripts, if nothing else.",

Firstly, the vowels are spoken then the consonants.\n\nThe vowels are divided into two sub categories, the short vowels and the long vowels with each sub category pronounced alternatively. Example, in English the words pin and peel both have the 'e' sound in them but it is more stressed (or long) in peel. Thus, in Hindi there is a short 'e' followed by a long 'e' (yes, 'e' is also a vowel in Hindi)\n\nThe consonants are again divided into sub categories based on where the sound is produced and how the tongue, teeth or lips interact while pronouncing. Example, there is a sub category in which, while pronouncing the letters, the lips will touch each other. In English they would be similar to letters, P, B, M. Or there is a category where the tongue strikes the bottom of the mouth while pronouncing the letters (example, T, D in English).\n\nSo this guy, Mr Watt may have been true and I think he must have researched Sanskrit or Hindi to reach the conclusion. Just Google or wiki Sanskrit language and you will find that it has been spoken since 1500BC.\n\n\u0907\u0924\u093f\u0964",

The letter _beta_ was at that time pronounced as a V-sound (as it is in modern Greek, and in contrast to Classical Greek), so they added a new B-sounding letter _before_ it. Also, that's why a Cyrillic V looks like a Latin B.\n\nNow, why the Latin G, being an innovation derived from the Latin C, ended up between F and H, I have no idea.\n\n----\n\nEdit: \n\nAlso, specifically about X and Z: both are (equivalents of) common letters in Classical Greek; the Romans inherited them through Etruscan intermediacy. The Romans used X as a replacement for CS or GS every place they could, but Z only appeared in rare loanwords from Greek (e.g. _zona_). It makes sense Z would end up at the end (in contrast to Greek and Etruscan alphabets, which placed it near the beginning). The X seems to have been moved near the end by the Etruscans, who (from here on I'm just guessing) probably didn't use it nearly as much as the Romans.",

You'd learn the table by reading it one row after another, but at some point the original table was lost and it became just a sequence. How was the ordering of the table determined? The original Phoenician alphabet was organized so that letters next to each other in the sequence would be far apart in pronunciation - so Alef (the glottal stop, pronounced in the back of the throat) was followed by Bet ('b', so the front of the mouth), then Gimel ('g', the mid back) and Dalet ('d', the mid front). Then it went to the next row, and so on. Looking at it myself, the theory mostly makes sense, it just gets funky later in the alphabet. The professor thought this was evidence that we may be guessing the wrong sounds for the original letters - that is, it might not be 't' but 'ts' instead. Fun stuff.\n\nTl;dr the English is like 5 iterations down a copychain from the original but it may have originally been a table in order of the way the sounds are made.\n\nEDIT: Link formatting, whoops. The wiki has some good stuff on the Phoenician alphabet if you're curious. \n\n",

When you pronounce it you see your tongue rises with every alphabet.\n\n[See this chart](http://hindilearner.com/images/alphabets/consonant.png) for all the consonants in order.\n\nEdit: A word.",

            "comment": "The orderings are a stroll through the history of civilisation, likely a partial result of naming things via [acrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrophony). The initial block of letters were originally based on Egyptian hieroglyphs, passed through Phoenicia, and onto Aramaic/Semitic languages and proto-European. Later, Greeks (c. 10th BCE) and then Romans (c. 6th BCE)  formalized the ordering, through various tweaks. Monks in the middle ages set the version of Latin letters used in English.\n\nThe first letter, \"A\" is actually the representative of the \"ox\" (or, rather, it's earlier incarnation, the Auroch, aka the \"ur-ox\") -- you can still see the form, if you imagine it turned over: \u2200\n\nConsider that oxen were the first large creatures to be domesticated, and the first thing that would be used to create a stable, agrarian community. In Arabic and Hebrew, the word derived from the \"Aliph/Alef\" literally means \"tamed\" (animal).\n\nSimilarly, consider the Proto-Germanic/Norse rune-system, in which the first character \"Fe\" (\u16a0) represented \"livestock\" or \"wealth\"-- while the second character \"Ur\" (\u16a2) was \"Auroch.\"\n\nLikewise, the second Latin letter, \"B\" represents \"house\" - and \"bet/beyt\" in Semitic languages is still the word for \"house.\"\n\n",

For example, Japanese writing (that isn't kanji) is in the form of phonemes, and the order is completely different.\n\nA(Ah) I(ee) U(oo) E(Eh) O\n\nKa Ki Ku Ke Ko\n\nSa Shi Su Se So\n\nTa Chi Tsu Te To\n\nNa Ni Nu Ne No\n\nEtc. You can look up hiragana on Google if you want to see the rest, but the point is there's almost no overlap in terms of order other than the A(Ah) sound is still first. It's language and writing character set dependent!",

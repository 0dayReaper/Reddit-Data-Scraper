    "postText": "I work in a kitchen and sometimes I have to do tasks with my hands that give me blisters from a knife or other tool rubbing the same bit of skin over and over. After the blister pops or heals the skin underneath is usually pretty tender and raw, but if I keep doing the same task for a few weeks a callous forms where the tender skin was instead of continuing to blister.\nWhy does that happen?",

If you grip a pull-up bar, you can feel it deeper in your hand than the very first few layers of skin, no?\n\nI\u2019d imagine there\u2019s signaling systems present in the deeper dermal layers to increase keratinization of subsequently produced layers in that wound spot.",

            "comment": "The military-industrial complex necessary to maintain an effective and credible deterrent is enormously expensive. \n\n1.) Consider the fact that the US national laboratories expend a considerable amount of computation resources and expertise and infrastructure dedicated to the modeling of weapons perfomance since above ground testing is banned. \n\n2.) Consider sites like the savanna river site exist and are staffed to produce things like Tritium that is needed for warheads. \n\n3.) Consider sites like the Panex plant in texas exist to make components for nuclear bombs. \n\n4.) Consider the personnel and support staff and security staff needed to maintain and control access to secure sites. \n\nIn sort: probably the equivilent cost of several air craft carriers- at least. If you really want to know, just add up the line items in the annual national defense authorization acts from congress.",

            "comment": "TL:DR - this is a number that is poorly projected by congress and updated every 2 years. Experts admit we don\u2019t really know and typically put the number somewhere between $20 and $60 billion per year with the accepted average sitting right around $35 Billion per year. \n\nThis is a number that is actually presented to us by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) - kind of. \n\nThe CBO is required to set a budget to project the costs of the next 10 years. This budget is updated every 2 years and often goes up by a huge amount indicating that the budget as planned is never enough. \n\nThe current 10 year cost is figured at $634 billion. The ten year cost 2 years ago was $494. There are reasons and nice words as to why the budget can change so much in two years but in reality it is probably because the cost is so difficult to know. \n\nThis budget does cover more than what you are looking for with the costs broken down as such:\n\n$297 Billion - Nuclear systems and weapons (costs related to subs, bombers, and ICBMs capable of dealing with Nukes)\n\n$142 Billion - Weapons, labs, and supporting services (this is where most of the cost of up keeping and updating falls)\n\n$94 Billion - Command, control, and early warning systems (the people costs to run and defend against bombs that have not been used 50+ years)\n\n$551 Billion -  Subtotal of projected cost for the USA because nuclear bombs exists (higher than items above due to rounding and a few misc line items). \n\nOn top of this there is one final line item and it is the one that is most telling as to the fact that we really don\u2019t know what this all really costs:\n\n$83 Billion - Additional costs. (As a financial estimator I can turn in reports with a 3-5% adder based on a project. If I turned something in that said \u201c+15% because of stuff\u201d I would not have a job)",

The provide a sharp increase in neutrons enough to start the chain reaction and only last a certain number of months or years before the bomb becomes either weaker, very weak or unusable. The uranium and plutonium itself is not enough to start the reaction on modern compact weapons. You may be able to view the cost of these facilities, which are produced in undisclosed locations (well, unadmitted aside from general national security interests and such facilities have a known nuclear breeder inside).",

It wouldn't take much decay to diminish the amplification effect in a multi-stage weapon.\n\nThat has me wondering if the weapon's tritium can be overprovisioned to a degree to decrease the frequency of maintenance, without consuming too much warhead internal volume.",

Nations such as China and Russia can do it cheaper than the USA due to a favorable exchange rate.\n\nA lot has to go right for a bomb to work as designed. A lot of these bombs have to survive a rocket launch and re-entry. So there is a lot of preventative maintenance not just for the bombs, but also the rocket systems and the re-entry vehicles.\n\nThe USA is the only nation which has actually proof-tested an ICBM system whereby a nuclear weapon successfully detonated after surviving re-entry. Of course this happened decades ago and that system has long since been replaced by one which has never been tested. A lot of money is spent on simulations for bomb designs which have never actually been tested. There are billion dollar facilities that exist for this purpose.",

            "comment": "Maintaining a nuclear arsenal is a complex and expensive endeavor. The costs associated with nuclear weapons programs can vary widely depending on the size and sophistication of the arsenal, as well as the resources and infrastructure required to maintain it. Some of the key factors that contribute to the cost of a nuclear arsenal include:  \nDevelopment and production: Designing and producing nuclear weapons requires significant investment in research and development, as well as specialized manufacturing facilities and materials. This can be a very expensive process, especially for more advanced weapons.  \nTesting: Nuclear weapons must be regularly tested to ensure that they are still functioning properly and are safe to use. This can involve conducting underground nuclear tests, which are both costly and controversial.  \nStorage and security: Nuclear weapons require specialized storage facilities and security measures to prevent unauthorized access and ensure that they are not accidentally detonated. Maintaining these facilities and ensuring the security of the weapons can be a significant ongoing expense.  \nUpkeep and modernization: Nuclear weapons also require ongoing maintenance and upgrades to ensure that they remain effective and reliable. This can involve replacing or upgrading components, developing new technologies, and adapting to changing geopolitical circumstances.",

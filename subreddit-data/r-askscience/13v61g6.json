It was the idea that we were nearly approaching the maximum oil production possible, and every year afterwards we would produce less and less oil. I've now been out of the system for 10+ years and I haven't heard of the term again. What happened?",

            "comment": "As a concept, it still exists, e.g., some recent papers have suggested that yet again, we're about 10-15 years from [peak oil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil) (e.g., [Delannoy et al., 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261921011673)). \n\nIn terms of what happened such that concerns about peak oil that were prevalent in the early 2000s largely (at least temporarily) vanished? Basically, a sudden rise in oil production after ~2010 (e.g., [this graph of US oil production minus Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil#/media/File:Hubbert_Upper-Bound_Peak_1956.png)), which, in short, reflected the new-found ability to economically develop unconventional reservoirs, i.e., the \"shale revolution\". Much of this has to do with \"tight\" reservoirs, i.e., rocks - like shales - containing lots of oil and gas but where that oil and gas is hosted in rock with very low porosity. Tight reservoirs were largely unexploitable because the porosity was so low that if you sank a nearly vertical well and extracted from it, you would basically just get the oil/gas right next to the well bore but then virtually no fluids would be able to move in to replace those (and thus you in no way were able to extract enough oil/gas to recoup the cost of drilling the well). What changed by around 2010 was the ability to economically develop these reservoirs through a variety of advancements in production and extraction technology that had been developing over the prior decades. A lot of the focus is often put on hydraulic fracturing, i.e., \"fracking\", which was definitely critically important, but what sometimes does not get as much attention are advancements in direction and horizontal drilling by which you could drill parallel to the surface over long distances (with branches off, etc). Neither of these were new as of 2010, but the combination of them (along with increases in efficiency and capabilities of both) allowed for horizontal drilling, at depth over large distances, within these tight reservoirs and to then frack along these paths to increase the porosity enough to where you can start to extract large amounts of the fluids within these formations (i.e., enough to recoup the cost of drilling and operate with a profit). There were a few other techniques that were important (e.g., various \"enhanced recovery\" methods where you flush a reservoir with a variety of fluids by pumping in fluids from one set of wells along with extracting fluids + oil picked up along the way from another set, etc.) but directional drilling and hydrofracturing were really the big ones for getting at \"tight\" oil, and thus allowing for a sudden resurgence in oil production. \n\nThis, somewhat overnight, opened up *huge* reservoirs, that had been known about for decades but were never really economical to exploit. Returning to the production in the US, if you look at oil production split out by conventional vs unconventional (i.e., tight), you can see that [conventional production basically followed the Hubbert projected decline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_oil#/media/File:OilProductionTightTotalHubbert-dec2021.svg) and virtually all of this new production was in tight reservoirs. If we circle back to renewed suggestions of a coming peak (e.g., the paper cited at the top of this), it's a little more of the same in the sense in that we've been hitting unconventional resources hard for the last decade+, and these, just like conventional, are finite. The difference now is, as best we can tell, there isn't much in the way of similar resources to what unconventionals were before we could extract them. I.e., if we consider the 2000s, we saw that production was declining or plateauing globally, but we knew about tight reservoirs and that they had a lot of usable petroleum products in them but lacked the tech to get them, which fueled a drive to develop said tech. Now, there's not really an equivalent \"we know there's a ton of petroleum in X, but we can't get it\". This is also superimposed on a different economic, political, regulatory, and societal landscape compared to 10-20 years ago, related to the proliferation of variety of renewable power generation methods, growing concern about climate change, etc.",

                            "comment": "I'm definitely not an expert on drilling tech, but my understanding was that while directional drilling was around, either the level of control and/or the lengths required (i.e., being able to basically drill a long, effectively horizontal bore) kind of came on line around the time mentioned above. Happy to have someone with more experience in the drilling / production industry fill in the gaps as to what the big advance(s) were that allowed the unconventional boom to take off if it was not primarily horizontal drilling.\n\nEDIT: [This paper](https://ecollections.law.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1256&amp;context=faculty_publications) provides some useful perspective and discusses, among other things, (1) kind of a tandem improvement in the capability and efficiency of both horizontal drilling (at depth) and fracking that allowed for the development of unconventionals and (2) that many of these technical advances were being pioneered 10-20 years (i.e., 1990s to early 2000s) before they saw wide adoption. I've edited the original answer to be more inline with this.",

Aviation and trucking a little bit too.\n\nSlightly under half an ordinary refinery output is gasoline.  New refineries are more focused on making as much petrochemical and as little vehicle fuel as possible.\n\nRoughly, petrochemicals are expected to grow by about 1/3 by 2030 and have doubled by 2050 (compared to 2020).\n\nFor instance, fertilizers are made from natural gas but can also be made from heavy crude oils.  You want more food, you need to use more petrochemicals.  \n\nPlastics, rubber, lubricants, composite materials such as carbon fibres...  All the things you need to build infrastructure and new low-emission vehicles.\n\nIndia, SE Asia and Middle East are growing in those production areas.\n\nOverall: petrochemical is predicted to roughly offset the decline due to vehicle fuel, but could go a little bit either side.",

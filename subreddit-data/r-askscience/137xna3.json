    "postText": "Hallo everyone \n\nso pretty much what the title says.  So let's say that you get infected with a germ and your innate immunity takes care of it but not easily, thus meaning a day or two with very mild symptoms. Does your adaptive immunity still kicks in so the germ gets wiped out instantly in the second infection or does it do nothing and only kicks in when you get fully sick? The second case would mean that your innate immunity would have to fight and defeat the same germ over and over again causing you to have those very mild symptoms repeatedly over very long periods. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo what happens in reality?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThank you in advance!",

            "comment": "The adaptive immunity only kicks in when the innate immunity is unable to eliminate the pathogen. The innate immune system provides the first line of defense against pathogens and works to contain and eliminate the infection. However, if the innate immune response is insufficient to control the infection, then the adaptive immune system is activated. The adaptive immune system is more specific and can target the pathogen with a high degree of precision, but it takes time to develop a response. Therefore, the adaptive immune response is typically slower to kick in than the innate immune response.",

When the innate immune system detects the presence of a pathogen, it releases chemical signals that trigger the adaptive immune system to start producing specific antibodies and T cells that can target the invading pathogen.\n\nMy initial wording was unclear on this. The innate immune system does not necessarily \"know\" when it cannot eliminate a pathogen, but rather the activation of the adaptive immune system is a response to the persistence of the pathogen.",

The innate immunity\u2019s defense system isn\u2019t attacking using the same trick over again. It has different types of enzymes that keep moving up the order if the previous enzymes fail; this way, the body\u2019s response to destroying the germ stages quickly. The adaptive immunity kicks in when the innate immunity remains unsuccessful after working for more than 96 hours. It aims specifically at the identification and termination of the germ that\u2019s causing infection, so this process is slower but accurate and memorized by the body forever. \n\nReason for the delay between innate and adaptive immunity is that the latter is much more serious plus sensitive as it can end up attacking itself by mistake, and it also functions using the information taken from the first. A person falls sick when lots of innate immunity cells gather in one place to eliminate the infection, heating the area up. This is the body\u2019s way of showing that something\u2019s wrong inside. Now, the magic here is that the symptoms may develop at any time because they\u2019re independent of the immunity cycle!",

It\u2019s like a computer heating up from overworking. We say it\u2019s from cells gathering up in one place as that region is where the battle\u2019s going on. For example, if you have throat pain, your throat will be the area where WBCs are having a brawl. Bacteria can die from this increase in temperature, too, so it\u2019s beneficial both ways. :-)",

            "comment": "Yes and no. You can think of the innate immune system like a moat and castle wall while the adaptive immune system are the soldiers inside. The innate immune system will activate as soon as you're exposed to a pathogen because it's always there waiting to repel whatever might come its way. The adaptive immune system takes a few days to kick in (train the soldiers for the specific pathogen and deploy them to the walls). If the infection is very minor and can be repelled by the innate immune system quickly, the adaptive system will never activate. We are exposed to hundreds to thousands of pathogens every day but most never make it past our innate immune system. But if the infection lasts a little longer (\\~1 day or so) then the adaptive system will start training its soldiers even if the infection is cleared before they are deployed.\n\nThe second time you see an infection, you already have the specific soldiers needed on the walls so both the innate and adaptive immune systems work together to get rid of the pathogen quickly. In this case the soldiers are memory B cells (and their antibodies) as well as T cells with specific T-cell receptors. You may not even notice these repeated infections as your immune system will activate and kill the infection so quickly. \n\nSometimes pathogens will evade our innate immunity (like some strains of COVID19) which makes adaptive immunity really important. In our castle analogy, this like tunneling beneath the walls. If we have trained soldiers (B and T cells), we'll still be able to repel the invasion but without them the pathogen can cause a lot of damage. One way COVID19 does this is by inhibiting host protein translation. Often an infected cell will initiate a response to infection to either signal to other cells its infected or start apoptosis to prevent further spread. But if the proteins needed for this cannot be made, then the virus can continue to use the cell to replicate until it depletes its resources. \n\nChapter on adaptive and innate immunity - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27090/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27090/)\n\nCOVID19 evades innate immunity - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9838430/",

            "comment": "Different animals have different mating systems, which are the ways they choose their mates and reproduce. \n\nSome factors that affect mating systems are **genetic diversity**, **environmental stability**, **parasite resistance**, **parental investment**, **sexual maturity** and **reproductive success**.\n\nSome animals mate with partners of similar age, while others do not seem to care about age difference. \nThis may depend on how long they live, how fast they grow, how much they invest in their offspring, and how much competition they face for mates.\n\nFor example, rodents like lemmings can reach sexual maturity in 1-2 months, and they may not live very long. They can mate with partners of any age as long as they are fertile. Dogs and bovids (like cows and sheep) take about a year to reach maturity, and they may mate with older or younger partners depending on their availability and attractiveness. Whales take much longer to mature, and they may prefer mates of similar age because they have more experience and social bonds.\n\nSome animals have monogamous mating systems, where they form long-term bonds with one partner. This may happen when both parents are needed to raise the offspring, or when mates are scarce.\u00a0\n\nMonogamous animals may mate with partners of similar age because they have more compatibility and cooperation. \nSome examples of monogamous animals are wolves, beavers, gibbons and albatrosses.\n\nOther animals have polygamous mating systems, where they mate with multiple partners. This may happen when one parent can raise the offspring alone, or when mates are abundant. \n\nPolygamous animals may mate with partners of different ages depending on their quality and availability. Some examples of polygamous animals are lions, gorillas, deer and peacocks.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/mating-systems-in-sexual-animals-83033427/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammalian_reproduction\n\nhttps://breedingbusiness.com/best-breeding-age-for-dogs/\n\nhttps://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/sexual-maturity-in-puppies-what-to-expect/\n\nhttps://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.13851",

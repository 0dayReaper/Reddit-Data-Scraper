            "comment": "When oysters reproduce, the male releases sperm into the water, which is then captured by the female. Fertilization occurs internally, and the female releases eggs that are fertilized by the sperm. The fertilized eggs develop into larvae and float in the water. These larvae eventually settle onto a suitable substrate, such as a shell, where they develop into spat, which are juvenile oysters. The spat continue to grow and form their shells by extracting calcium carbonate from the surrounding water. They filter-feed on plankton and other microscopic organisms in the water to obtain nutrients for growth. Over time, the oyster continues to grow, adding layers to its shell and reaching maturity.",

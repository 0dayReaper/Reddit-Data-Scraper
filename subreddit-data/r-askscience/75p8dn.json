You need a way higher alcohol percent to act as disinfectant, much higher than listerine has. ",

It will kill pretty much every cell it comes in contact with, including yours. In the short term, its not a lot of damage, and the tissue in the mouth regenerate really fast, but it can make healing from something else slower.\n\n\nAccording to this the following study, long term use of mouthwashes containing alcohol increases the risk of getting oral cancer. \"the use of an alcoholic mouthwash twice daily increased the chance of acquiring cancer by over nine times (OR 9.15) for current smokers, over five times for those who also drank alcohol (OR 5.12) and almost five times for those who never drank alcohol (OR 4.96).27\"\n\nhttp://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1834-7819.2008.00070.x/full\n\nThe role of alcohol in oral carcinogenesis with particular reference to alcohol-containing mouthwashes\nAuthors\nMJ McCullough,\nCS Farah",

As I understand it, the tissues are more tightly packed together and regenerate much quicker so it's usually not a problem.

Using hand sanitizer to strip your skin of this natural layer makes you more prone to infection and is generally unhealthy. There are situations where you want sanitized skin such as having an injury or if you are a surgeon, for example.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_flora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_flora)\nSkin flora is usually non-pathogenic, and either commensal (are not harmful to their host) or mutualistic (offer a benefit). The benefits bacteria can offer include preventing transient pathogenic organisms from colonizing the skin surface, either by competing for nutrients, secreting chemicals against them, or stimulating the skin's immune system.[3] However, resident microbes can cause skin diseases and enter the blood system, creating life-threatening diseases, particularly in immunosuppressed people.[3",

Most soaps are made up of two layers, one of which attaches to any and all oil on your hands, and one which wants to attach to water. It causes all the oil, dirt, etc on your hands to be suspended within the water, which will wash away when you wash your hands off.",

It's not going to do the most thorough job of it, but it still acts as any other detergent and destroys cell membranes by pretty much the exact property you described (as the phospholipids in the membrane are amphoteric). Killing bacteria isn't generally the main purpose of washing with soap and water, but it definitely happens.",

Naturally these are somewhat hazardous to human health, so the conditions for sterilisation have to be VERY tightly controlled - a level as low as 75ppm of hydrogen peroxide is \"immediately dangerous to life or human health\" for example, and that is one of the least toxic gaseous sterilants.

Diluted bleach will kill e coli, staph, salmonella, norovirus, basically all the potty viruses and bacteria you would expect to encounter if you licked a dirty toilet (probably don't lick a dirty toilet). Well, all the ones you can reach, anyway. \n\n\nBut you don't need to worry about killing *everything* because you and your family are safely ensconced in a body. Keep the bathroom mostly clean, wash your hands with soap and hot water, and you'll be fine. If you're feeling neurotic, close the toilet lid before you flush. Seriously, why don't people do that? Thats why there is a lid.  \n\n\nNot having children will probably go a long way in keeping your face uncontaminated, too. Kids are pretty gross. \n\n\n",

I even found a great review [here] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88911/), which states:\n&gt;In general, biocides have a broader spectrum of activity than antibiotics, and, while antibiotics tend to have specific intracellular targets, biocides may have multiple targets. The widespread use of antiseptic and disinfectant products has prompted some speculation on the development of microbial resistance, in particular cross-resistance to antibiotics.\n\nSo you'll see, the review I'm linking even asks a bit about the question OP's asking, as the mechanisms of action of antiseptics aren't as necessarily well known as antibiotics (although this could have changed more recently, this isn't my field).  Frighteningly, it appears that there are microbes that *can* develop resistance to antiseptics, depending on their methods of sterilization - but the review clarifies:\n&gt; In these cases, \u201cresistance\u201d may be incorrectly used and \u201ctolerance,\u201d defined as developmental or protective effects that permit microorganisms to survive in the presence of an active agent, may be more correct. Many of these reports of resistance have often paralleled issues including inadequate cleaning, incorrect product use, or ineffective infection control practices, which cannot be underestimated.\n\nSo the TL:DR; antiseptics/disinfectants are much more broad-based than antibiotics with generally multiple intracellular targets ('kills indiscriminately'). There are reports of microbes developing antiseptic resistance although it's mostly speculative. Instead, there are antiseptic/disinfectant-resistant microbes, depending on the method of sterilization of the agent.",

You may as well worry about developing resistance to having a nuke dropped directly on your face.  Alcohol essentially saps bacterial cells of all moisture instantaneously, and to combat that they would need to develop characteristics which would essentially make them not even bacteria anymore (like a plant-like cell wall or a eukaryote-like complex cell membrane)\n\nEDIT:  I got a few things wrong, thanks for pointing them out everyone! (no sarcasm intended).\n\n-  Alcohol doesn\u2019t work mainly by sapping moisture, it actually causes the bacterial cell membrane (and eukaryotic cell membranes also) to basically dissolve.  We can put it on our hands because of our epidermal outer layer of already-dead cells which basically doesn\u2019t give a fuck about alcohol.\n\n- Some bacteria actually can develop resistance to low to moderate concentrations of alcohol, by devoting more resources to a thickened cell membrane.\n\n- Look up bacterial endospores.  These can survive highly concentrated alcohol solutions and cause surfaces to be re-colonized under the right conditions.",

Endospores are basically small, dormant, heavily protected copies of the bacteria that reside within the confines of the cell wall, alongside the bacteria itself.  Alcohol will absolutely kill the main bacterial cell but the endospore will often survive.  Under the right conditions the endospore can grow into another active bacterium.  \n\nA common bug spread in hospitals, C.difficile, is known for having this mechanism.  That\u2019s why hospital staff are told to specifically wash their hands after contact with patients suspected to have this; the alcohol won\u2019t reliably kill the endospores.",

            "comment": "It depends on what\u2019s in the hand sanitizer. \n\nThe triple antibiotic soaps and hand sanitizers will absolutely cause resistance to develop. This has already been documented and it is discouraged to use those types of soaps and sanitizers. \n\nFor alcohol based sanitizers, the mechanism of killing bacteria is much more intense, for lack of a better word. Antibiotic resistance can be through random mutations of the targeted protein or an enzyme that sequesters or degraded the antibiotic; antibiotics act in a very specific way, so resistance is just a change in the very specific mechanism. Alcohol\u2019s effect is far-reaching and affects nearly all aspects of bacteria. It is very unlikely that all the proper mutations will be present to resist the alcohol\u2019s effect. In fact it\u2019s so unlikely that it hasn\u2019t been documented to any reasonable degree that I know of. \n\nThe 0.01% is most likely due to bacteria forming spores or improper technique over a tiny portion of the skin. \n\nPlease correct me if I\u2019m wrong or have any assumptions I should state. \n\nEdit: felt that further clarification of why spores don\u2019t develop resistance was necessary.\nYou can think of spores as dehydrated cells. They have a thick cell wall that resists most extreme environments, e.g. low nutrients, low and high temperatures, low moisture, radiation, etc. so they won\u2019t react to any stimulus at ergo they won\u2019t acquire resistance since they aren\u2019t really living (so to speak)\nThey are actually a worry when sending space equipment to other planets. How do we know if life found there is native or just a spore that decided to start populating the planet when it fell off the space equipment?",

These kill the bacteria biologically - preventing these particular life forms from existing, some by targeting the cell wall, others by targeting the cell membrane, others by the bacterial enzymes.  \n\nAlso crucial, is that examples of anti-biotics aren't just limited to prescription pills given by your doctor.  You can find them in hand soaps and even in some hand sanitizers, in the form of \"triclosan\", which can build triclosan-resistant bacteria.",

            "comment": "So, the issue with hand sanitizer is not that it isn't effective at killing bacteria, the problem is that it is very good at killing bacteria indiscriminately.\n\nBacteria live all over your body, inside and out.  Their behavior ranges from beneficial, to neutral to detrimental.  For most people, the vast majority of bacteria making their home reside on the beneficial side.\n\nThe reason for this is that even a bacteria with no direct positive (making food more easy to digest or whatever) but also no direct negative (making you sick) still use resources that prevents a directly negative bacteria from taking it's place.  These neutral bacteria provide us the benefit of competing with negative bacteria.\n\nWhen you rub alcohol all over your hands you kill all positive, negative and neutral bacteria on your hands, which opens up a massive number of new homes for bacteria all over your hands and some of those bacteria might not be friendly.\n\nSo what do?\n\nDon't use antibacterial soap for your hands (dishes, w/e).  Water alone removes a significant number of transient bacteria.  Seriously, it's between 50 and 75%.  Handwashing with soap and water is of course better and will get rid of 70-95% of transient bacteria (depending on study and what bacteria they're looking at).  These methods will leave the resident flora (for the most part) of your hands happy to live and compete with all the negative nancy's that try to enter to community.\n\nThe only real reason to wash with alcohol or other disinfectants is when you're practicing aseptic technique, either for maintaining pure cultures or treating people medically.",

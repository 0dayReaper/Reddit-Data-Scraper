            "comment": "A CPU can only work on stuff in its cache and the RAM of the device (be it PC / Mac / console / mobile / etc). However, such memory is volatile, and loses all its data if it is not powered. To solve this problem, secondary storage exists: hard disk drives, DVD drives, USB disks, flash memory, etc. They hold persistent data that is then transferred to the RAM as and when needed, to be worked on by the CPU. \n\nNow, when a computer boots up, a lot of its core processes and functions are pre loaded into RAM and kept there permanently, for regular usage. (The first of this stuff that loads is known as the *kernel*.) They are also heavily dependent on each other; eg, the input manager talks to the process scheduler and the graphics and memory controllers when you press a button. Because these are so interconnected, shutting one down to update it is not usually possible without breaking the rest of the OS' functionality*.\n\nSo how do we update them? By replacing the files *on disk*, not touching anything already in memory, and then rebooting, so that the computer uses the new, updated files from the start. \n\n*In fact, Linux's OS architecture and process handling tackles this modularity so well that it can largely update without a restart.",

One example of this is the ksplice project, but writing these patches is non-trivial.\n\nThe short answer, is that it's much easier to restart and have the system come up in a known consistent state.",

Given enough RAM, one could stand up a second copy of the kernel and switchover to it on the fly.  One could equip kernel subsystems with the ability to save state/quiesce/restore state (some of it is already there for power management/hibernation) and design kernel data structures in a way that allows to track every pointer that needs to change before such a switchover is possible. Hot-patching technologies like KSplice do something like that, albeit in a much more targeted manner - and even their applicability is greatly limited. So yeah, it is possible to design a non-rebooting system, but our efforts are better spent on things other than making the scheduler hot-swappable. Reducing boot time and making applications resumable go a long way towards making an occasional reboot more tolerable - and that\u2019s on top of other benefits. ",

An open file is _also_ a reference to that file.  So if a file's referenced by a directory entry and a running process, that's two references, deleting the directory entry still leaves an active reference, and the file itself remains.\n\nAll such references to a file are peers\u00b9, you can e.g. `touch a; ln a b` and you've got two names for the file, two references to it.  `rm a` and the `b` reference and the file itself remain.  System upgrades replace the directory entries with new files, but the old files stick around as long as anybody's still using them.  _That's_ why upgrades generally don't need a reboot: it's fairly uncommon for the two versions to be so incompatible that having both in use at once causes a problem.\n\n\n\n\n----\n\u00b9 There are also \"symbolic links\" that muddy the waters here, they're breadcrumbs, a relative path to follow to find whatever happens to be there at the moment.",

If you want to change your kernel or bootloader, most distributions will require a reboot.\n\nIt is possible to replace a running kernel while running, but most distributions don't bother supporting that as a means of updating. It's also still a very good idea to reboot. Why? Because you need to make sure your computer **will** boot. Otherwise when it DOES reboot, it might not come back up cleanly. Better to find and fix now than when a hardware component fails.\n\nAlso, updating major software components while running may produce strange results. Some applications load everything they need into memory when they launch, and they will happily carry on even if you pull the binary out from under them. Many applications include dynamic plugins, resource files on disk, configurations, etc. Those applications are not going to do so well when something changes.",

Most of the time, it's safe to leave a program running as you're deleting and replacing its files, because the program will continue to have access to the old versions until it closes those files. The only time that you'd have to stop the process for the duration of installing the update is if the program is closing and re-opening its own files during normal operation.",

It's not just, or even primarily about background programs.\n\nYour operating system is made up of thousands of code libraries that are loaded to perform various tasks for apps or the OS itself. When these are updated there isn't usually any easy mechanism to just stop whatever functions these libraries may have been performing, record their state and the state of anything they were interacting with, unload them, load new ones in, point the code that depends on them at the new interfaces, restore all the states and continue on.\n\nBeyond that, the OS is responsible for providing the environment all your apps work within -- filesystems, memory, windowing system, audio, etc. etc. If it's necessary to update the code that provides the environment you can't just shut down the old software, ripping those resources away from running apps, and substitute in new versions. When was the last time you wrote application code that handled its file system or memory (still in use) being destroyed at any moment? This would make app development hell (and dangerous).\n\nThe OS itself is even split into layers, you have things like the BIOS, the boot loader and security environment, virtualization, kernel, user mode, etc. If updates are needed to one of these layers it's likely the layers above have no way to know how to handle the change in environment below them, forcing a restart so everything  comes back up in the new state.\n\ntl;dr - Your computer is layers of stuff running in environments provided by other layers of stuff. When a lower layer needs updating there is usually no easy way for higher layers to handle changes and a restart lets everything come back up fresh in the new environment.\n",

It is more than possible to design systems, even operating systems or other low level programs which don't need to be rebooted in order to update(this concept is called 'hot swapping'), but it is harder to design those systems and sometimes also harder to reason about their correctness.

You could do it, by moving desks and departments, and handing all the resulting confusion (think of the poor mail room), and doing a lot of cleanup and maintenance. If you mess up the temporary addressing, or your blueprint is off, things could grind to a halt (i.e. crash) real quick. Worse, you might send things to the wrong address and cause weird stuff to happen (send your important records to the incinerator instead of the archive, send salary information to a department other than accounting), causing permanent issues (i.e. data corruption).\n\nOr, you could kick the employees out, gut the building, rebuild, and then welcome the employees back.\n\nKey point: an in-place upgrade requires a plan for not just the new structure, but for the processes and daily goings-on (i.e. cached data, in-memory data structures, open files, and so on). You need to ensure that either things behave exactly as before, and that a brief interruption won't be an issue, or you need to plan how to handle the changes.",

The typical procedure is to replace the files with the new copies, then quit and restart the program. That results in much less downtime. The reason this is safe is because deleting and replacing a file with a new version doesn't interfere with the already-running program accessing the old version that it already has open.",

The reasoning is you don't want to open a file, make changes but not save, and then have something else make changes to the file and save them.  Because when you do save the file, you'll overwrite the changes made by the other process.  So when your computer is on, a lot of system files are locked.

This is the source of most of Windows's modern problems \u00ad\u2014 a lot of it was designed for very low-power personal computers, most of which would interact with perhaps other computers in a single office at worst. Designing the OS to be secure when connected to a network of millions of other potentially malicious computers around the world was simply not important, because it would get in the way of making it run well on this low-powered hardware. Similarly, designing it to be able to be updated without a reboot was not important, because updates came on floppy disk and so were rare enough (and usually something the user actually requested or bought, since Microsoft didn't just send floppies out willy nilly) that not being able to apply the patch/update/whatever without a reboot was simply not important.\n\nWhy don't they just scrap it all and start again? They have, but they can't go as far as they might like because backwards compatibility is king. You make a new version of Windows that breaks some business-critical software, and guess what? That business won't upgrade.\n\nLinux and Mac OS by contrast are based conceptually around UNIX, which has almost since it began been designed for larger networks of comparatively high-powered connected computers. They are also both relatively OK with breaking compatibility, so redesigning components that prove to be suboptimal is much more likely to happen.",

For instance, lsass.exe, which is responsible for logging you in and taking care of lots of security \"stuff\", cannot be shut down and replaced at runtime. This could, possibly, be fixed. However, untangling the dependencies and sorting things out safely would be a nightmare.\n\nThere were so many things on Windows that would be a lot easier if back-compat wasn't so important. However, we always had to be sure the last 20+ years of applications would run after any changes. This makes things a bit tricky at times, to say the least :)\n\nThe reboot pain is understood, and that's why new features have been added over time to help make things easier. \"Use my sign in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update or restart.\" is one such baby step.\n\nedit 1: Sorry if it wasn't obvious, but I'm talking about Windows because xbox runs Windows.\n\nedit 2: Also, if the hypervisor is being patched, a reboot is almost always needed. Reliably hot patching the hypervisor is possible, but it's much simpler to reboot when applying hypervisor updates.",

As far as I know it's possible on both desktops and servers, but on desktops it may have some additional caveats as servers typically have simpler setups, e.g. no graphical interface to complicate things. I couldn't immediately find out how difficult it is to pull this off for desktop systems.\n\nIt's easier to just expect people to restart a device though, and since there is little market demand for devices not to reboot, many companies are reluctant to put aside resources for this.\n\nEven as a home user who knows that this is possible, I don't require continuous uptime, so I too just reboot after receiving important updates.",

            "comment": "In principle it would not be necessary. While, as per the other responses, the natural way to do an update is to stop the old software and start the new one (a.k.a a reboot if the software is an Operating System) many Operating Systems (including Windows) support Hot Patching of almost all OS components. But in order to support Hot Patching a fix needs to be written with that process in mind, which involves converting any persistent data structures that change in format or content, informing any dependent components, etc. Doing so can easily double the effort to write a patch, and more importantly also lenghten its development and test period.\nMost OS patches fix security vulnerabilities, so developers try to have them ready as quickly as possible (any minute a fix is delayed increases the odds of it being exploited by the bad guys), which means skipping Hot Patching altogether and getting the minimum viable fix on the shortest time possible.\nCombine that with the fact that patches often get installed in bundles, so a developer may not feel it is a good investment of his or her time to work on hot patching when most likely some other fix will require a restart anyway. \nIn many cases the fix gets rewritten after it ships with the incorporation of hot patching, but by then most people already installed the original one when it vane out, and so they already had to reboot.\nSo to summarize the reason is time to market (and in some cases laziness): requiring a reboot instead of coding a fix so it makes all required changes on the fly saves a lot of development time and when you are in a rush to ship something any minute counts. \nSource : I was a PM involved with reliability improvements for a major OS at the time this feature was being written. Biggest disappointment in my career how this feature ended up being ignored, but in all fairness I suspected what was going to happen when I started with it. ",

            "comment": "Short answer: It\u2019s cheaper, more secure and less costly. It has nothing to do with any technical limitations. \n\n\nThe technical answer is; they don\u2019t. The longer answer is called Return on Investment. The time it would take to make a OS, such as the Xbox Windows OS be patchable without requiring a reboot is too costly in time and in security vulnerabilities.\n\nLook at it this way, if all the squares on your screen on the Xbox were just websites, you\u2019d hit refresh and bam you may have a new version of the site. No rebooting. We can abstract this concept out all the way to the base kernel layer.\n\nThe \u201ckernel\u201d provides a set of common ways of talking to all the physical (hardware) pieces inside that Xbox. This way ever little app or game doesn\u2019t have to know the specifics of the physical pieces inside the box. It\u2019s told hey there\u2019s something that can do math, something that can draw on your tv, something to make sound, etc. and it doesn\u2019t care how it\u2019s done because the Kernel knows for you. For those that want me to say HAL. There I said it.\n\nNow, let\u2019s say App Netflix is talking to the Internet and all of a sudden the Xbox is told there\u2019s an update to the Kernel for the Internet piece. We can still keep the old version running and provide the new service for when you restart Netflix. But, what if the update included a security fix where a hacker can get into your machine if you keep using the old version? Now the Xbox has to force you to shutdown Netflix and reload it. \n\nNow let\u2019s take that a bit deeper. The Xbox itself uses the Internet for updating news feeds, player scores, friend lists, etc. before you know it there are 20 \u201cparts\u201d are are required to be restarted or else the security hole will still exist. All this is still technically possible to so without \u201crestarting\u201d the box. But at what point are you not restarting the box?\n\n",

You often need to access and replace locked files that are associated with these process and services.  Many can be stopped and started without a reboot but if these are at a sufficiently low level (e.g. associated with the OS Kernel itself) then you do need to restart the OS itself.",

            "comment": "Because in order to update specific components you need to have a system above it to handle the update. While this is possible it is often hard.\n\nFor instance suppose that a computer game has a patch and it involves updating the executable and a file containing a model (the graphical information like the vertices and colours, etc).\n\nFor the graphics file you could program your loader in such a way that you can invalidate models and be forced to unload them, then switch to the new one however this means it disappears on screen. You also might end up clipping because the new model has different sizes, and hit detection stopped working for a moment. You need to handle all of these cases.\n\nAlternatively you can make it update the file on disk but keep the old one but what happens if it's multiplayer and two people see different things? What happens if you're forced to unload the image (like if you alt tab and lose the graphics memory).\n\nThe executable is even harder - you need to build your executable in such a way that you can lose a part of the game for a moment then plug in a new one seemlessly. There's a lot of reasons that this is hard (optimization being the most difficult one as well as rewriting the entire executable in such a way to make this possible).\n\nInstead the game waits until it's not running to update - it's much easier, less bug prone, and good enough for 99% of applications. It leverages the operating system to do this.\n\n\nOperating systems are the next step up in complexity. You can write everything in such a way to let everything be able to disappear during an uninstall but it's very difficult to do so - Linux has tried but certain components still require a restart. You could write an operating system above the operating system - often called a hypervisor and done in data centres - but then how do you update that?\n\nThe difficulty in writing software to update on demand is the primary reason it's not done. Trying to retrofit an OS to do it would be a buggy nightmare. Generally speaking restarting is annoying but hardly damaging for regular consumers, the massive number of bugs would probably annoy you more.\n\n-A Microsoft OS dev",

            "comment": "It\u2019s not exactly wrong to think about it in terms of \u201cX chemical causes Y behavior\u201d, but it leads you down a conceptual path that excludes the concepts of balancing and cooperation that is critical in all things neurobehavioral, certainly among animals and even more so in humans. A similar misconception has unfortunately remained ubiquitous regarding testosterone, particularly in men. Testosterone really cannot be directly linked to particular behaviors (though disruptions in synthesis or SHBG expression can certainly suppress some realms of behavior), but rather to the abstract landscape that these behaviors travel through as we express them. As Sapolsky likes to half-humorously say, if you picked out the Buddhist monk with the most testosterone, he\u2019s not going to be the horniest and most debaucherous monk, but rather the most selfless and ascetic one in the bunch, or at least the one striving for those most potently. In other words, the androgens (in the context of neurobiology, so including DHT and aldosterone) generally intensify and provide direction for existing behaviors generated from other perceptive and neurobiological sources.\n\nOxytocin and vasopressin combine in a variety of contexts to produce a very wide range of social behavior in humans, and often the same mixture will produce different impulses based on the perceived environment, one classical example being similar OTR activation trends in maternal bonding and sexual behavior, but with very different (stronger) contribution from prolactin in the former, and very little in the latter. Vasopressin will also cooperate with oxytocin at the vasopressin receptor V1ar, and the dynamics of this cooperation are heavily contextualize by perception. So, it\u2019s more holistic to say that certain cooperative patterns of vaso and oxy underly the specific behavior seen in mothers (and fathers!) during infant bonding, rather than to try and force vasopressin into a one-dimensional knob that increases and decreases some behavior, and you\u2019ll find this is true of most pathways in neurobiology.\n\nSue Carter at the Kinsey Institute would be the go-to for more reading on this topic. The neurobiology of oxy and vaso in the context of familial bonding is basically her field.\n\nAlso remember that humans are animals too. To quote Sapolsky again, human neurobiology can basically be summed up as grabbing stuff off the shelves of the mammalian neurobiology Home Depot and innovating new and more complex ways to use them as tools for socializing, and certainly vasopressin is a great example of this.\n\nSome of Carter\u2019s work:\n\n\u201cThe Oxytocin\u2013Vasopressin Pathway in the Context of Love and Fear\u201d: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5743651/\n\n\u201cOxytocin and Human Evolution\u201d: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/7854_2017_18\n\n\u201cOxytocin, vasopressin and sociality\u201d: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0079612308004275",

Why does perception affect the behaviour produced by hormones? You said:\n\n&gt;and often the same mixture will produce different impulses based on the perceived environment,\n\nThen if the same mixture will cause different behaviours based on perception, is it that the hormones affect different neuropathways in the brain? Do they bind to different receptors? What causes this effect? Also does vasopressin affect men differently than women in regards to parenting? Where could I read more about its effects specifically in men and male nurturing behaviour do you think?",

Sometimes that response is just an emotional one (eg you see something that triggers a memory), sometimes it ends up in the motor cortex (you see a tasty treat and grab it). Oxytocin and vasopressin in this scenario are more about biasing the landscape towards behavioral tones, rather than a random vasopressin dump unconsciously making you hug your baby. There are still billions of other pathways that can contribute to the sum brain activity in the 2-3 seconds during this hypothetical window, and differences in those plus different perceptual stimuli can prompt different responses even when oxy and vaso pathways look similar.\n\n&gt;\tThen if the same mixture will cause different behaviours based on perception, is it that the hormones affect different neuropathways in the brain? \n\nOxytocin can affect a wide range of pathways in the brain, including the vasopressin receptors. Again though, I would caution against this idea of a certain neurotransmitter hitting a certain receptor and triggering a deterministic, knee-jerk style emotional reaction.\n\n&gt;\tAlso does vasopressin affect men differently than women in regards to parenting? Where could I read more about its effects specifically in men and male nurturing behaviour do you think?\n\nThe range of effects of vasopressin across the human brain is enormous. There is certainly some sexual dimorphism, but as stated above it generally takes the tone of different trends and intensities, rather than vaso simply doing something in women that is completely absent in men. Think about the macroscopic sex differences in the brain: it\u2019s not as if men or women have brain structures that are completely absent in the opposite sex. Rather, the ratios of volume, density, connectivity, etc are shifted a tiny bit, but keep in mind there is also substantial variation within sexes. Also, this question is incredibly hard to study, because obviously you simply cannot do virtually anything invasive to the brain in a healthy human, even more so in a mother with an infant. We have data from animals models, but again given that human neurobiology is so unique and hyperbolic, it\u2019s not the best practice to extrapolate neurobiology in models we are 100 million years diverged from onto human behavioral pathways that are maybe a couple hundred thousand years old.\n\n\u201c[A] comprehensive review of the sex-related influence of OT and VP on social cognition, focusing on partner preference and sexual orientation, trust and relevant behaviors, memory modulation, and emotion regulation.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6529726/\n\nSome more work from Carter, circulating oxy and vaso levels in men and women plotted against a battery of behavioral metrics. \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6943921/",

A study found that men who possessed the longer version of the vasopressin receptor gene were twice as likely to leave bachelorhood behind, in order to commit to one single woman for life, and thus became monogamous.  \n(Source: [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6061718-the-male-brain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6061718-the-male-brain))  \nSo that's similar to the famous prairie vole study on this hormone.",

    "postText": "A little googling suggests that the total biomass of the earth has been declining at least since the human age (no surprise), if not much earlier.\n\nAre there good estimates of the time course of Earth's biomass over the planet's history? Did it slowly and continuously ramp up until recently (with, I guess, big dips when an asteroid hit or other mass extinctions occur)? Or is there a plateau that it hit early and generally sustains (quickly re-attaining after mass extinctions)?\n\nSub-questions:\n\nAre there good estimates of biomass saturation times for subdivisions of life? Like, I guess maybe Bacteria peaked earlier than Eukaryotes, but then got another boost by living with Eukaryotes? When did arthropods saturate? When did vertebrates saturate (have they yet)?\n\n(The dumb shower thought that led to this question: I wonder if, millions of years from now, it will be easier to find fossilized disposable diapers than it is, today, to find fossilized trilobites? How many trilobites were there? Billions, trillions? How many disposable diapers in landfills are there?)\n\n*edit* (hard question, i guess? guess now i'm going for a high upvotes/comments ratio!)",

Turns out that trick for using sunlight and carbon dioxide to build their bodies has worked out *very well* for them.",

            "comment": "You have 3 major environments for life.  Oceans, land and the earth's crust.  Most of the biomass today is thought to be on the land in the form of land plants \\~80% which only emerged in the Ordovician \\~470 MYA and perhaps only became the dominant form of biomass in the Devonian-Carboniferous \\~400-300 MYA after trees evolved. \n\n Since only some 1% of current biomass is thought to be in the ocean before that you are looking at the majority of life being deep biomass, mostly bacteria and archea, at least up to 10.5 kilometres below the sea floor and 5 kilometres below the earths surface, surviving on detritous closer to the surface or sea floor and the breakdown products of rocks lower down and generally living very long very slow lives and they've been there for a long time.  It's currently thought to be about 15% of all dry live biomass but could be far more.  While climate change or disasters can almost wipe out surface life it has little effect on archea 10 kilometres into the crust eating hydrogen and 'breathing' manganese.\n\nProbably the total biomass grew steadily from the beginning with mainly lithotrophs gradually expanding into available environments.  The evolution of photosynthesis in cyanobacteria in the archean \\~3.5 BYA would have opened up new environments with a new source of energy but I'd guess by itself it was no more than a small portion of the existing biomass, however with abundant energy they could live and die fast and produce far more. Currently the dry live biomass of earth bonds some 550-560 Billion tonnes of Carbon and every year bonds about 100 Billion tonnes of environmental Carbon.  Very little of that is done by the deep biomass which reproduces and dies very rarely.  Fast living primary producers can support more secondary-tertiary-quaternary, and so on, life.  In the ocean the primary phytoplankton in fact weighs less than just the secondary life, the zooplankton that eats it directly, and much less than the web of predators and detritovores that it supports.  It grows so fast that it supplies up to 50% of the oxygen in the air despite taking up less than 1% of biomass.  A similar situation could have happened with the first photosynthesisers with a relatively small amount of them supporting a vast web of slow living detritovores, much like the archea and bacteria on the deep ocean floor today. \n\nThe evolution of eukaryotes in the proterozoic \\~2.7 BYA and then multicellular life \\~1.6-0.6 BYA provided all kinds of interesting fossils but probably only increased the total biomass slightly, if at all, until the first land plants.\n\nSaturation in terms of absolute biomass isn't really what life evolves towards, rather it evolves towards a saturation of consumption, even if that reduces biomass.  For example if you introduce, say, goats to a lushly vegetated island they will increase quickly, overgraze everything, subsquently starve themselves to a remnant population if not wipe themselves out and the island will support far less biomass for the foreseeable future.",

            "comment": "Big mixed bag of possibilities.  From 100% -&gt; zero % below:\n\n*Lactase persistence* (you may know this as *lactose intolerance* an outdate term that no longer describes the condition or the population.  It is the ability to break down animal milk as an adult, because all babies can do it) is one example of something very much genetic.  The genes for adults to consume animal have independently evolved 3 or 5 times in history in separate human populations.\n\n*Lactase tolerance* (or the ability to have 1-2 glasses of milk without a problem) is a mixture of genetics, childhood development and environment.  Some people can have 1 cup and train their gut to have more, but they cannot have 2 cups right now today without long term environmental exposure.\n\nCeoliacs disease (gluten allergy) is genetic, but in clusters.  If one parent has it, a child has &lt;15% chance of inheriting i but % varies on other factors too.\n\nPeanut allergy seems plausable genetically but less likely.  Only 20% of peanut allergies have shared genetics.  Seems reasonable, but that means 80% of peanut allergies are spontaneously developed.\n\nEczma-related allergies.  There is a strong correlation between babies with topical skin eczma and increased food allergies.  Top of my head, it's studied that babies with eczma need to be exposed to peanuts before age 4 months, but non-eczma babies it's 6-9 months.  Babies exposed to peanuts before those dates tend to not develop peanut allergies versus control subjects.",

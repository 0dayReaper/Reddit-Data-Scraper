    "postText": "I live near a river that has mercury contamination. My general understanding is that mercury sinks to the bottom, and anything that eats plants on the stream bed accumulates mercury, and by further biomagnification, fish are absolutely off limits for eating. If the mercury is at the bottom of the waterbody, does that mean that plants in the floodplain are safe? How does mercury spread through ecosystems, rivers and ground water?",

            "comment": "The plants living in the water will not be safe. Bacteria at the bottom of the lake turn much of the atomic mercury into [methylmercury,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methylmercury) which is a polar molecule with affinity for water. It forms new compunds, dilutes, and is uptaken by the roots of the plant. [Methylmercury often forms chloro or hydroxo complexes when in oxygenated water.](https://os.copernicus.org/articles/10/1047/2014/os-10-1047-2014.pdf)\n\n[Aquatic plants readily remove mercury from water and are seen as a potential way to remove it from the environment.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16781033/)\n\nAny plants living off that water basin could also be contaminated, but some will fare better than others. [If the plants are terrestrial in nature, they are generally tolerant of mercury. This is particularly true if they are woody plants.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10789973/)\n\nMethylmercury is known to accumulate much more quickly in the bodies of aquatic animals than the inorganic form. [This article cites seven orders of magnitude between the concentration in water and that of piscivorous fish.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20877813/)",

                    "comment": "To expand on this, it overwhelmingly isn't metallic mercury \"sunk\" in a river that one has to worry about.  \n\nThink of Iron.  Iron is very rarely found as a metal naturally, and iron objects tend to turn to rust in the environment and eventually dissolve to nothing.    Iron (+2) is much more soluble than Iron (+3) in water, so the amount of oxygen can change the availability and transport of Iron.   \n\n\n Mercury has similar things going on.  \n\n\nAdditionally organic (and halogen) mercury compounds add relatively more complexity above many other metals.  Also, they can be very toxic, so we care more.",

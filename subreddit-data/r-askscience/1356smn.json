            "comment": "This does happen already in our particle colliders! The LHC can make a [pion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pion), which have, in their own rest frame, a mean lifetime of 26 nanoseconds. However, the are traveling so fast in the LHC, that they are observed to have a mean life time of 800 nanoseconds instead. \n\nAlso, perhaps of interest, muons are ~~ejected in cosmic rays from the Sun towards Earth~~ created when cosmic rays hit the upper atmosphere. Muons live \"a lot\" longer than pions in their own rest frame, they live about 2 microseconds, but that is still far too short of a time to make it ~~from the Sun to the Earth~~ from the upper atmosphere to the surface of the Earth. But, they are traveling so quickly (as measured by an Earth observer) that they make it here frequently. \n\nAnother thing of interest. While an observer on Earth sees the muon traveling very quickly, and thus has time dilation, which is why it can make it to Earth, if you were attached to a muon, you would see things differently. Of course, the muon doesn't think there is time dilation, time is still passing at \"1 second per second\" for the muon. Instead, the muon sees length contraction- it would measure the surface of the Earth as being much closer to the upper atmosphere that we do in our own rest frame.\n\n** Edit ** corrected as pointed out below",

They are produced on Earth in the upper atmosphere when high energy particles (mostly from other sources than the Sun) hit atoms. Without relativistic effects half of them would decay every 600 m so no muons would reach the surface (~100 half lives), with time dilation a significant fraction makes it.",

If a particle has enough energy to be moving near the speed of light (let's say somewhat arbitrarily &gt;99% the speed of light), then the distance it travels before decaying is the speed of light times the energy of the particle times the speed of light squared over the mass of the particle (Ec\\^3/m). So if you want a muon to live a billion years, and travel a billion light years, you will need to give it an energy of 2X10\\^11 joules, or 2X10\\^17 times more energy than the LHC gives its protons. Not achievable with any imaginable accelerator.",

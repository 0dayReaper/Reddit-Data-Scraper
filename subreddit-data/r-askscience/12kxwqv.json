In the act of \"converting\" the raw sounds we hear into an understandable conceptual meaning, do we take this sentence\u2019s-meaning-assembly process word by word, or process it in phrases at a time (and if so, how large), or do we only translate sound into meaning once a full clause's statement\u2014or question, demand, etc.\u2014is completed?",

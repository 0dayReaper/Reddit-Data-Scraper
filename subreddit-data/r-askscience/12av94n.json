    "postText": "GDP can be measured as the market value of final goods and services. A final good is a good purchased by the ultimate user. So if a bakery buys flour, the flour wouldn't be a final good. But if a consumer buys flour to make bread for personal consumption, then the flour is a final good. \n\nIf a bakery buys a cellphone to handle incoming calls, is the cellphone a final good? I imagine the bakery is the final user of the cellphone. Yet the cellphone seems to be part of the bakery's inputs, so I'm hesitant to say yes.",

            "comment": "The cell phone in your example isn't part of the inputs that become outputs. They aren't adding value to the cell phone (unless they're buying it as a bread ingredient to get that good, good crunch). If a refurbished computer store were buying cell phones to strip for parts, then it wouldn't be a final good. It is for the bakery.",

            "comment": "The point of only counting final goods is to ensure we count everything once, instead of every time it changes hands. To your question, we don't want to double-count the cellphone as both a product of the electronics company and a capital investment of the bakery, just like we don't want to count the wheat three times when it gets sold to the mill, as flour to the bakery, and as bread to the customer. Like any good accountant, we pick one system and apply it consistently. \n\nSo, don't get hung up on the bakery, because that's a tiny slice of the economy. For national GDP, we count the phone at the point of sale because that's an easy convention. After all, a farmer used a tractor to grow the wheat, but we count the tractor at the point of sale too, because otherwise this will get very confusing. The phone and tractor are being used for their final intended purpose and aren't being consumed/transformed into something else.",

GDP can only attempt to estimate recorded transitions; in time of hardship, the black market can rival normal commerce; no criminal activity is included.\n\nEconomics will always be chasing moonbeams, making predictions of what will happen followed by excuses to explain why it did not.\n\nIt is not accidental that economics and politics are studied together.",

It feels kind of obvious that it\u2019s the right weather for one to form but I asked other people and they said they couldn\u2019t tell. Can anyone else or am I imagining it?",

            "comment": "When considering conditions required for tornados form, it isn't hard to make a fairly accurate prediction when you are right there in the middle of it. The pressure differences can be felt and they usually produce other weather effects that tend to be precursors to the tornado itself and can be indicators one is about to form, high wind, heavy rain, possibly hail, all results from the meeting of low and high pressure weather systems. There are also often visual indicators such as the unique clouds that form in the same conditions that tornados do which can help warn people. Most people who are aware of what to look for will have no problems recognizing tornado weather. \n\nFor someone who knew nothing about tornados, how they form and was completely unaware, I don't see why their subconscious wouldn't be able to recognize the dangers and manifest a feeling of anxiety or fear to motivate that person to get safe.  I wouldn't assume it was some kind of super power, and I also wouldn't assume any sort of reliability around using such a feeling to predict the weather if you or others were at risk. I mean it wouldn't be any more reliable then any other phobia the protects people, for example a fear of snakes. Sure its right every time that it's a snake, but is it a venomous snake? There's a point where the fear isn't rational for phobias and could cause you to make the wrong decision, Think swatting a fly that lands on your dinner plate, the food is now on the floor. Know what I mean?",

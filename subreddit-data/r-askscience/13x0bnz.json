            "comment": "Do you mean Duffy-negative? The Duffy antigen is a protein receptor located on the surface of blood cells and a common receptor for malarial parasites. For Duffy-negative individuals, they have resistance to malaria because the they can't bond to the Duffy protein receptor (as it is missing). It is however important to note that this does not confer blanket protection, nor does it stop one from becoming a malaria carrier.",

            "comment": "\nLike others have said, human reticulocytes (immature erythrocytes) that are Duffy negative impede the ability of Plasmodium vivax merozoites to attach and invade. This is why vivax is mostly absent from the African subcontinent- it is an ancient disease originating in Africa which lead to the spread of the Duffy negative trait there. Most vivax cases are now in the new world and Asia following introduction of malaria, primarily with European colonisation. There are however new studies showing that vivax can infact invade Duffy negative erythrocytes through other ligand/receptor interactions[link](https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1008258)\n\nOf interest as well to Duffy negativity is the effect on platelets. Platelets are capable of killing the blood stages of malaria and are crucial to the early stages of infection before an adaptive immune response can be generated. The agent of platelet killing, platelet factor 4, however can only bind to and enter Duffy positive cells, [see here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30026183/) [and here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23224555/)\n\nThis means that most of the African duffy negative population are perhaps not benefiting from this crucial protective role of platelets following infection with falciparum. Its funny how evolution works, but in a way it makes sense. Vivax is an ancient disease so spread of duffy neg led to the absence of that pathogen long ago. Meanwhile falciparum, which now causes 95% of the malaria mortality in Africa, is a recent pathogen, probably only crossing into humans within the last 10,000 years, [this is a cool review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32905751/) . Nowhere near enough time for PF4 to change or for Duffy to make a comeback.",

            "comment": "Cells which lack Duffy antigens (referred to as Duffy null) are immune to infection from malaria caused by the parasite Plasmodium vivax only. That parasite uses that antigen as its attachment site to red blood cells. There are four different members that routinely cause malaria, but Duffy null is not very common in areas where Plasmodium vivax is common. It is sort of an interesting footnote, but doesn't really display selective pressure like one would assume it would.",

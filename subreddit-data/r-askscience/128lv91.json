    "postText": "The Wikipedia article on [Causes of Cancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_cancer) sums up the common wisdom thus: \n\n&gt; **Cancer is caused** by [genetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation) changes leading to uncontrolled cell growth and [tumor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplasm) formation. The basic cause of sporadic (non-familial) cancers is DNA damage and [genomic instability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genomic_instability). \n\nI recently was doing some reading on non-mutagenic carcinogens, and came upon an article, [*Mechanisms of non-genotoxic carcinogens and importance of a weight of evidence approach*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1383574209000428), which states very clearly, emphasis mine: \n\n&gt;Non-genotoxic carcinogens are **substances that induce cancer** through  indirect stimulation of hyperplastic responses, **without altering DNA,  chromosome number or structure**. Non-genotoxic carcinogens have a wide  variety of mechanisms of cancer induction including receptor-mediated  endocrine modulation, non-receptor mediated endocrine modulation, tumor  promoting, inducers of tissue-specific toxicity and inflammatory  responses, immunosuppressants, or gap junction intercellular  communication \n\nThere are many similar sources, but this one seems to state the point most explicitly. So, what's going on here? Has \"cancer\" simply been differently defined back in 2009 than it is now? Has the evidence been overturned that there is such a thing as a carcinogen without genotoxicity? Are they simply so rare as to be of no practical relevance and so knowledge never made it into public consciousness? Some other explanation?",

            "comment": "Not all genetic changes need to be caused by altering the genetic sequence. Gene regulation is the mechanism through which the amount of gene transcription is controlled, and changes to this regulation mechanism can induce phenotype changes in a cell without directly altering the genetic code. Epigenetics is the field of study of this exact phenomenon, exploring how environmental factors influence the expression of genetic sequences. These are still considered genetic changes, because the interactions with the genes is changing, although crucially the genetic sequence itself remains unaffected.\n\nAs the text you linked describes, there are many different pathways through which genetic expression can be altered. Epigenetics is usually the study of the methylation of DNA strands, which decreases transcriptional activity. However, disruptions in cell signaling pathways such as hormone signaling can also greatly influence gene transcription.",

However, as the paper itself pointed out some non genotoxic carcinogens are immunosuppressants that decrease the body's ability to detect and fight common levels of cancer and lead to higher concentrations of these cells and eventually tumors and rampant cell growth",

            "comment": "Chemical induced cancers and viral induced cancers are an example.  No changes to genetics required to get cancer cells.\n\n* Carcinogenic chemicals are split into two relevant categories: *genotoxic* and *nongenotoxic.*\n\n*Non-genotoxic* carcinogens are substances that are mentioned in your quote. \n\nBasically, that big quote of text states that chemicals block normal cellular processes from happening, leading to cancers.  Your genes are still unchanged, expressing proteins and making enzymes to do stuff in your body.  A chemical can block a specific enzyme from doing it's job, which make a little bad cell.  Overtime that results in more and more bad cells, which ends up as cancer.\n\nYou can also get cases where some chemical creates a dead zone inside your body.  It leads to a tumor being formed around the chemical.  Your normal immune system cannot clear that chemical and the tumor keeps growing until removed.\n\n* Viral cancers such as *Hepatitis C* can be nongenotoxic. \n\nHepatitis is the 3rd leading cause of cancer deaths, so worth considering in your hypothesis.  HCV cannot integrate into the human genome; hepatitis B can.  HCV causes *epigenetic* changes to the entire genome, which longterm result in cancer.  It causes your unchanged genes to change what/how they express proteins.  It's a subtle point of difference, but your chromosome remains intact.\n\nThere is also a type of skin cancer that is unrelated to genetics.",

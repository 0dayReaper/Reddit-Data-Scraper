    "postText": "I'm studying platihelminths at the moment and the dorsal and ventral sides of the animal are repeatedly and specifically mentioned throughout the lesson. Like, higher platihelminths have 2 ventral nerve cords. \n\nI wanted to know how we determine which side of the animal is the dorsal/ventral side. It seems pretty obvious when it comes to planaria or sharks ( the side that faces the ground when they're in their 'usual positions' is ventral) but how do we determine which side is the dorsal/ventral side in animals like humans? Is it an arbitrary concept like the equatorial line that we have come up with for convenience? \n\nI know the anterior side of an animal is determined by cephalization and the concentration of sensory structures/ganglia/brain. Is there a specific parameter like that for the dorsal/ ventral sides?",

            "comment": "Humans - well, for one thing, it\u2019s the side the stomach is on that is ventral. Dorsal is where you find the backbone. I think the origins of the words \u201cventral\u201d and \u201cdorsal\u201d are from words for stomach and back. If the animal is not a vertebrate, ventral is the side toward the substrate. Ventral nerve cords do sound confusing, though, because in vertebrates the backbone does house the main nerve cord.",

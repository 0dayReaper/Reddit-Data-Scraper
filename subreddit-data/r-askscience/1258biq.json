Theoretically an officer should be able to conduct a repeatable standardized road side test to determine impairment but that doesn't really exist in the way that a breathalyzer does. The NHTSA has a program you can get certified as a drug recognition expert and can conduct a test after you have been arrested to determine sobriety. But the nuances in it allows cops to arrest basically anyone. If you had a joint a 10am and drive at 6pm you'll likey fail a blood test at the nanogram level even though you aren't high anymore. Studies for people driving on a various drugs are interesting too. Pot for example doesn't seem to slow reaction time down, but alcohol definitely does. A lot of states basically threw their hands up on blood tests which DONT work but people think they do...",

I will not bother citing these as they typically don't have solid citing themselves, just your run if the mill articles.

Maybe even promising with this study:. \nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3942723/\n  \nIn short, not enough sample size in any study to confirm anything, but most studies show a near negligible benefit towards the positive end.",

Responding (simplified greatly) is a two-step process: accumulating the information needed to discern the correct response, and generating a motoric/physical command to actually make the response. Caffeine only affects the motoric aspect, in that it simply makes you quicker to respond.

Like I highly doubt even blood alcohol content of 1% would be survivable, considering people are deemed legally drunk at 0.08% iirc, and a solution with less than 1% ethanol is going to have at best a trivial effect on THC\u2019s solubility, like that\u2019s about as much alcohol as is naturally present in a lot of fermented foods that (obviously) aren\u2019t legally counted as alcoholic, or in \u201cnon-alcoholic\u201d beer (probably quite a bit less, actually). The point is, THC isn\u2019t going to be that much more soluble in a solution of ethanol that dilute than it is in water (THC is mostly carried through the body via its high lipid solubility, anyway).\n\nI would presume the issue is due to neurochemical potentiation of some kind, like the cannabinoid receptors (specifically the CB1 receptors, which are the ones mostly responsible for the psychoactive effects of THC) are directly tied to how neurons respond to GABA, which is the CNS\u2019s main inhibitory neurotransmitter, it also happens to be the neurotransmitter that ethanol primarily affects (acting as a \u201cpositive allosteric modulator\u201d iirc, which essentially means that it sensitizes GABA receptors to respond more strongly to less of the neurotransmitter). I forget the precise interaction between the cannabinoid and GABA systems in the brain, but I know it\u2019s pretty significant, as it\u2019s tied to one of the main purposes that the cannabinoid receptors have in the CNS in the first place, but I\u2019d hazard a guess that it plays a very large role in why ethanol and THC tend to interact significantly, and often badly. Obviously a neuropharmacologist would be the one you\u2019d want to ask about this, but typically when two drugs interact with each other, it\u2019s not because of the physical properties of bulk quantities of the chemicals, but because of how their respective effects on neurotransmission amplify one another.",

Kid blew a .18 BAC. Cop who administered the test was certified and had recently updated that cert before the test was administered. The machine was calibrated before the test using a +/- standard which it passed. After the test resulting in .18BAC it was tested again against known calibrated standards and it passed. The test was run again and again resulted in a .18BAC. If you don't know BAC, .08 is legally impaired in most states because .1 was too drunk. .18 is pretty wasted. \n\nThe defense managed to get the Breath test tossed because of it's problems from a decade or so back. The kid walked. \n\nI was pissed off.",

There are even substrates where it has direct excitatory effects (e.g. the vagus nerve, via direct activation of TRPV1/TRPA1 cation channels) \n\nI hope if anything comes from cannabis research in coming years, it's a perspective shift in neuroscience generally regarding the importance of lipids in physiology.

But in reality, every water source on earth, even ultra purified distilled water, has some trace amounts of every element. Just because someone invents an instrument that can detect poisons in the parts per trillion level doesn't suddenly make drinking the water less safe.\n\nThe law may say \"zero parts per million is zero poison\" but the half a million dollar machine in a chemistry lab says \"zero parts pre billion (or even trillion) is zero poison\". \n\nIf money/privacy/ethics was no limit you could detect THC in your body at much lower concentrations. So \"how long THC stays in your body\" isn't accurate. What they really mean is \"how long before the THC levels drop below some arbitrary legal threshold\"",

The first two are what's relevant to characterizing a high.\n\nAbsorption: the phase where the drug enters the body. Oral drugs are absorbed into the bloodstream in the intestines, inhaled drugs via the lungs. Absorption through an edible is a slow and steady ramp up, while the lungs deliver it to the bloodstream instantly.\n\nDispersion: the circulatory system carries the substance around the body, the amount reaching the brain determines how high or drunk you get, but it's also diffusing into their tissues. Alcohol moves pretty freely so we call that a \"one compartment\" model where the amount anywhere in the body is roughly the same, while THC likes fatty tissues, what we call a \"two compartment\" model because the amount of THC in your blood vs fat changes over time and the latter acts as a sink/reservoir.\n\nThe point where the blood concentration is the highest is the point where you feel the most intoxicated. A lot of THC in the blood means it will diffuse into tissue, leaving the blood, thus your high comes down. As the remaining THC in the blood gets cleared, the stored THC starts diffusing back into the blood. So in reality you're still under the influence long after the high ends, it's just a steady low-moderate effect which becomes a lot of people's \"normal\" between use.\n\nKind of like how you're not drunk off a single beer with lunch, but it is affecting your mood/concentration/ect.",

    "postText": "I know fossilization requires very certain conditions, so will human burial practices, especially of pets since they are most often buried completely as is, have an effect on the number of fossils? Similarly, will these fossils be hard to date due to their deposit in a layer that doesn't correspond with their death?",

            "comment": "Think about this. The number of fossils for most species is extremely few and most are incomplete. There are lots of exceptions to this. However, most creatures that lasted tens of millions of years, only have a few bits and pieces left even though many billions of individuals once existed.\n\nThe layer of soil we live on now will be compacted into a thin sliver. Most of it will likely be displaced and erode away. We don't know where the exceptions will be or if there will be any. There are big gaps in the geological record in many places due to ice ages.\n\nOur biggest exceptions will likely be from deep mines. Any people or animals that got trapped in a collapse and never recovered, probably have a good chance of preservation, and eventual chance exposure due to erosion.",

    "postText": "I read today that polar bears have the best noses of mammals and can smell things up to 18 miles away. How is that calculated? Also how does that work? From my understanding smell is tiny pieces of whatever you\u2019re smelling drifting off of the object and into your nose. I imagine it would have to be very specific circumstances for a smell to travel 18 miles. How fast can smell travel? How does it not get so diffused in the air that even if you could smell it you could pick it out of the background enough to actually do something useful with it.\n\nBonus question, sharks can smell blood in the water from great distances too, and I would imagine that smells travel much slower in water, so how does that work?",

            "comment": "Good questions. I cannot imagine how the 18 miles for polar bears scenting an odor was calculated.\n\nFrom a literature view that I did some years ago, it seems that the smelly molecules basically move on the breeze. They get diluted and moved mainly by air currents and turbulence. See [here](https://academic.oup.com/chemse/article/31/2/155/285981?login=false) for how male moths find their females by tracking the plumes of perfume that they emit upwind to their source. \n\nA quick hunt on Google scholar came up with \"Windscapes and olfactory foraging in a large carnivore\" (2016) (open access), which is about how polar bears sniff out their prey and agrees with my point of view.\n\nAs you say the odor will eventually be too dilute to detect, so chemicals that are meant to be detected (like the female' moths perfume) have evolved to be detected by their targets at incredibly low concentrations.",

What are the chances it will go for your kill? How many times? You will lose your bear after likely one attempt, but definitely within the number of times needed. Watch a bear and just wait until it finds something and track when it began heading that way? Sure, but the number of times and bears you need to track would be pretty immense and maybe by this point we have enough gps collars on them to work it out but they came up with that number before we got the numbers. Ultimately its too general to test empirically without very unreasonable resources.\n\nWhat they do for sharks, at least one way if they use math. They figure out the general dilution of a sample based on distance and add that dilution to a small poop with the shark in it. If the shark reacts when they put the diluted sample in, they consider that smelling at the distance the dilution would be.

The equations we use for fluid motion in Civil engineering are very simplified, and it appears that on a macro level we can understand most of the behavior but as the scale goes down it gets very, very, convoluted.",

            "comment": "I don't know about how it's figured out for other animals, but polar bears are one of the most studied animals in the world and polar bears are known to have the most olfactory nerve endings of any known animal. In the arctic where it's common to have sunless days in the winter and strong winds, polar bears don't rely on their sense of sight or hearing but instead rely on their sense of smell to find prey, find mates, and track their young. Polar bears always move in the crosswind to track their prey (they move against the direction of the wind) so the directional line of smell helps them in increasing their effective tracking range. With this knowledge, it is easy to experiment on polar bear movements by having an observer on the polar bear and another setting up bait upwind and see when the polar bear begins tracking.\n\nSharks smell through highly developed olfactory epithelium in their nostrils which along with water currents, allows them to home-in on the source of the smell. Their ability to smell and home-in depends in large part to how fast the smell is being dispersed. Sharks have been observed to be able to track to up to hundreds of meters away based on chemical concentration as low as one part per million.",

I\u2019ll try to remember to edit this tomorrow.\n\nSmell is a psychophysical phenomenon. It is a brain\u2019s perception of concentration(s) of chemical(s) in the air. We measure it in a weird way: essentially the number of dilutions it takes of a sample of air before we can\u2019t distinguish it from two control samples. So if you know the concentration at which a polar bear can detect a certain chemical (should be comparatively easy to figure out) and you can estimate the mass emission rate of that chemical from a source (also relatively easy), you can project the distance (i.e., 18 miles) simply by estimating dilution based on that stack dispersion equation.",

Then the environmental factors like air and water currents, whether its air or water its being carried on, etc.  A fair wind can carry a smell further than calm, and a heavy one might disperse the smell quickly.",

            "comment": "\"Windscapes and olfactory foraging in a large carnivore\" (2016) (open access).  Emphasized here are the polar bears moving crosswind  and smelling the air as they hone in on the prey over very long distances.  The smell is described in a Gaussian distribution.  The best conditions?  Night, slow wind crossing the ice shelf.  Too fast a wind and the smell dissipates.\n\n\"To track the movements of the polar bears, researchers captured 123adult female polar bears over the course of a ten-year period between2004 and 2014 and fitted them with GPS-enabled collars (males, it turns out, can\u2019t be fitted with collars because their necks are actually  their heads!) The researchers linked up the data on the bears\u2019 movements to surface wind speeds and directions modeled for the bear\u2019s habitat region.\"  Found a piece that describes it in easy terms:\n\n[https://www.cantechletter.com/2017/04/polar-bears-use-cross-wind-scents-hunt-prey-finds-new-study/](https://www.cantechletter.com/2017/04/polar-bears-use-cross-wind-scents-hunt-prey-finds-new-study/)",

I\u2019m assuming odor works by emitting \u201csmell particles\u201d or atoms. My understanding of diffusion is that a smell wants to disperse itself equally in a room space so why doesn\u2019t the food particles align themselves so they\u2019re diffused across the entire world?",

There has to be a certain minimum number of say menthol molecules in the air, for the olfactory system (the smelling nerves in the nose) to activate and send a signal to the brain.\n\n\n\nAnd this is what ultimately decides the distance at which X can be smelled.\n\nIn the real world however convection that is air current play a bigger role, hence us being able to smell forest fires from miles away if the wind is towards us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd yes the smell molecules do spread out throughout all of the arhmosphere, until they are eventually broken down.\n\nThing is, the athmosphere is huge, and a few individual menthol molecules inside your room just don\u2019t register. \n\nNevertheless assuming perfectly stable molecules and a one time release, these \u201asmell molecules\u2018 would eventually spread out around the whole planet, at an equally low concentration.\n\n\nWhich would be below the threshold for us or anything else to smell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2018s also why these systems don\u2018t respond to individual molecules: they don\u2018t give the animal any useful data. Once you are smelling individual molecules you are either so far after the event that released the smell, or so far away that it is not a viable source of food, so moving towards it would be useless.\n\nAnd to move towards the smell, there has to be a \u201aconcentration gradient\u2018 in the first place.\n\nI.e. step one Meter this way; and there\u2018s a measurable quantity or smell molecules more that way.\n\n\nOnce the smell has distributed equally this obviously stops working.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs far as OPs question, my comment about forest fires has shown that the actual distance is meaningless. Because it depends on two factors: A the minimum concentration smell molecules able to set off the animals smell system and B the actual environment.\n\nEven with the rare weather of totally still air, humidity would make a massive difference. If the smell molecule gets stuck to the water in the air, and there\u2018s no wind, the molecules won\u2019t be traveling far. If the air is completely dry; the molecules would travel much faster.\n\nAnd if the wind is blowing towards the animal, the smell they\u2019d otherwise be able to smell at say 500 feet, would suddenly travel miles upon miles and still be above the threshold concentration required for them to sense it.\n\n\n\n\nAnd that\u2018s why research is more focused on determining these concentration thresholds. I.e. how many molecules per given volume of air (or water for fish) are needed for the animals smell system to send signals to the brain.\n\n\nThis is something that you can actually test without outside interference.\n\n\nJust put the animal in a sealed box with air or water that is clean, and then release minimal amounts of the substance in question into the room, and measure the concentration of the substance in air once the animal shows it\u2018s responding.\n\n\nOr even more accurate: use the nerve cells in a Petri dish and measure the electrical signals they send off, when exposed to rising concentrations of the substance in question.",

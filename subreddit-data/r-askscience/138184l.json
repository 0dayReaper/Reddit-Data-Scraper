[https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/](https://www.nheri.org/research-facts-on-homeschooling/)\n\n  \nAccording to these studies homeschool students generally do better on standardized tests and have higher college graduation rates.  But this is messy in the US, states all have different rules on what homeschooling is.  Some students are only partially homeschooled.  Some states like Florida have loads of rules about homeschooling, others like New Jersey, parents don't even have to officially acknowledge it.  Also according to these studies, homeschool students trend white and upper or middle class.",

She was very awkward at first, and needed some people around she could trust to explain how social norms work. But within a few years that was all gone, and now she's at least as savvy as me, which is not very. She says \"I had to teach myself everything and there are gaps.\"",

Some parents get sick of their nerdy kid being bullied and get them through high school curriculum at 10: others know that if a mandatory reporter like a teacher sees the kid, they\u2019ll be taken away.  So self selection is the biggest factor.",

Teachers have a formal and ethical obligation to report suspected abuse. The parents therefore avoid enrollment to avoid detection of abuse. Pretty grim scenario",

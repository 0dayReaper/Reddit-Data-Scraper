Now he's been given 3 months to live. Doctors say it could have been there a long time, growing and spreading. \n\nWhy don't we just do routine full-body scans of everyone.. every year?\n\nYou would think insurance companies would be on board with paying for it.. because think of all the tens/ hundreds of thousands of dollars that could be saved years down the line trying to save your life once disease is \"too far gone\"",

            "comment": "1. Cost. The equipment and personnel needed to conduct such regular scans is prohibitive. A lot of people are talking about the machines, but the radiologists trained to read these scans are highly paid professionals.\n2. Time. To conduct full-body scans of every type would be prohibitive. The scans you mentioned aren't like X-rays; they're not instantaneous. They take time to conduct properly.\n3. Lack of personnel. We would need a massive influx of both techs to conduct the scans and radiologists to read them to handle the number of scans you're suggesting, and it would take decades to ramp up to a point where we have enough of them to handle the kind of volume this would be introducing. Both the techs and radiologists require years of specialized training.\n4. Space. MRI/CAT/PET machines aren't small. If you needed enough of them to conduct these yearly scans, you either need to get rid of something in hospitals/labs currently, or create entirely new spaces to house them. This again adds to cost.\n5. It's more likely to result in false positives and invasive exploratory procedures than real positives. Scans aren't always binary i.e. that's cancer/that's not. Many times there are areas that require further exploration. You might have to do more imaging focused on a single area, or a biopsy or other test.\n\nIn short, the chance that it might catch something isn't worth the cost in money/time/false positives. Unfortunately for your friend, the best indicators we have right now are symptoms, family history, and screening tests based on demographics.\n\nHopefully in the future, some or all of these barriers will be removed, and something like what you're suggesting will be possible rather than prohibitive.\n\nI'm sorry about your friend.",

If you gave frequent mammograms to every healthy woman then you would find all sorts of growths. Most of them would never turn into cancer and would never have been found under normal circumstances. But doctors can't tell the difference between safe and unsafe growths and so they treat them all as cancerous - meaning if they find something, they will start you on cancer treatment which itself carries a risk.\n\nIf you were to screen the entire female population every year then you would end up doing more harm by overdiagnosing and overtreating growths that were benign, than you do by limiting the screening only to those that are in a certain age bracket and/or have other symptoms.\n\nhttps://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer/screening-tests-and-early-detection/mammograms/limitations-of-mammograms.html\n\nNote: this is not a theoretical problem. This is *actually why* we have the recommendations we do on eligibility. The medical community has run the numbers and worked out when the harm outweighs the benefits.",

For instance, when [multiple scans over a patients lifetime](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/google-s-cancer-spotting-ai-outperforms-radiologists-reading-lung-ct-scans) are available to look at, it\u2019s much easier to spot growths. That makes intuitive sense, as tumors are going to be changing with time. [Low dose](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/news-events/newsroom/artificial-intelligence-enables-low-dose-ct-scans-faster-scan-time) CT is possible with large sets of training data, and presumable the more data the better the predictions. \n\nIf we got more detailed scans over time we\u2019d probably get better at detecting cancer. There probably characteristics of cancer vs benign dark spots that we\u2019re not tuned into yet, because we don\u2019t have enough info. Scanning everyone all the time sounds like a bad idea, but I\u2019ll bet that with lower doses and more frequent scans at higher resolution we\u2019ll have much better sensitivity in the next decade or two.",

If we do a biopsy and find abnormal cells that look borderline atypical but can\u2019t definitively say they\u2019re cancer, a lot of patients would opt for aggressive treatment.  However, that could potentially carry with it permanent pelvic pain, erectile dysfunction, incontinence, and many more issues.  All for something that wasn\u2019t actually cancer or going to harm the patient.\n\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of art that comes with interpreting test results.  The medical community as a whole is continuously doing studies to improve and deliver the best results to patients.  We do studies all the time analyzing the effectiveness of tests or procedures that we do and what are the drawbacks.  Frequent PSA testing is one of those areas where the large epidemiological studies show a lot of harm.\n\n\nThat said, there\u2019s a difference between widespread testing in an asymptomatic population, and ordering a test in response to symptoms.  If I order a PSA on every 50 year old man in the country, I\u2019m going to get false positives (or elevations that are caused by things other than cancer).  However, if I order the test in response to new onset pelvic pain, rectal bleeding, or unexplained weight loss, then that would be more likely to be to be indicative of cancer.",

It's not just about randomly deciding to test 1,000 instead of 1,000,000, but about selecting the 1,000 that have the highest likelihood of a true positive. They might be high-risk because of their age, or because they have other symptoms etc. But for many tests we need to narrow down who we test otherwise the harmful side-effects impact of false positives can outweigh the benefit of the true positives.",

So no one is getting cancer and is able to directly blame it on an x-ray, but we know x-rays mess with your cells and that can cause cancer. Give a million people an x-ray and *some* of those people are getting sick from it. \n\nIt ends up be really important to these question the exact mechanism by which radiation damage your cells. One theory, the linear no-threshold theory, says that if 100 rem is fatal 100% of the time, one millionth of that is fatal one millionth of the time. These levels are low enough that it\u2019s hard to ever be sure something raises the cancer rate by one millionth, so this is just a theory. Other theories say that our bodies can repair damage, and only large amounts of damage in a short period cause major problems, so that millionth dose maybe raises cancer by a billionth. \n\nThe jury is still out on this, but it would have implications for the current question of giving every yearly CTs. It\u2019s also behind the question of whether Chernobyl killed 400,000 people or 1,000 people (if the whole world got an undetectably low dose of radiation, does that still add up to super small increase in cancer rates, which is a lot of deaths when you consider the whole world\u2019s population).",

We barely have enough MRI time as it is for scans on people with symptoms, much less a yearly scan on every person in the country. There is also the cost to the healthcare system, an MRI scan is expensive for both the hospital and the patient. So the question becomes is the cost of doing that MRI yearly worth the benefit it provides to the population as a whole? Will it statistically improve lifespan or quality of life? And what downstream consequences might occur (i.e., unnecessary biopsies/surgeries)? Does the benefit outweigh the risk? \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs an example, lung cancer screening in a population at high risk (smokers) is still somewhat controversial and that population has a real risk of actually having cancer.

Recently I developed tennis elbow. I've had MRIs of both my cervical spine and elbow. Two different doctors have very different opinions 1.) I have neck pain and elbow/forearm pain due to cervical stenosis. 2.) The cervical stenosis is unrelated to all of my symptoms, I have some micro tearing in my elbow and that's the cause of pain there and my neck/back pain is all muscle related due to posture issues. \n\nMy point being being we don't always know what to do with symptomatic individuals with abnormal MRI results, it would be chaos with MRI results for asymptomatic individuals.",

Let\u2019s imagine a hypothetical test which measures some physiological value.  The readout of the test is a number from 0 to 100.    We plan to use this test to diagnose a condition so we want a binary outcome: do you have the condition yes or no.   So we have to define a threshold value which well call T.   So everyone who has a value above T is positive and everyone below T is negative.   \n\nSo imagine we want to minimize false positives.  We could set our threshold T at 100.   This way, we will never have a false positive (because everyone will test negative, a lot of which will be false).    Similarly we could eliminate false negatives by setting T at 0.   These are both silly choices of course, but it illustrates that there\u2019s a trade off.   \n\nTo give a less silly example let\u2019s assume that people without the condition have a value of 40 +/- 15 and with the condition have a value of 60 +/-15.  So we set the threshold T at 50.   But let\u2019s say someone has a value of 52.   It could be they are reading on the high end of normal.  Or on the low end of positive.   We can quantify these odds, but they form a probability distribution.  We can\u2019t definitively rule out either option.   \n\nSo we have tune the threshold to find a balance between false positives and false negatives that we want.  \n\nThis tuning is done using something called a [receiver operator curve (ROC)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)\n\nAnd remember that this was a simplified example.  Because biology is involved, it\u2019s always messier than you want it to be.",

Something which is cheap, quick, easy and has a terrible false positive rate but a good false negative rate.  So anyone who tests negative is in the clear (you want the test to be tuned for low false negatives because the potential consequences of a false negative are dire, especially if no further testing is done).   Ok, now we take our positive population and test again, this time with a new test which is better.\n\nSo a real life example might be a Pap smear.   It\u2019s uncomfortable but relatively simple and quick to do, with limited risks.  If that\u2019s positive you give the person a biopsy.   That is painful and expensive/time consuming to read, but gives a much more definitive result.",

That isn't really the argument against monitoring (that's the argument for it). Now you have the baseline weirdness documented, future tests are much better informed. (Patient later comes in with some weird symptoms. We know from previous screening these weird results are normal for them and probably not the cause of the symptoms.)\n\nThere is an argument against it though and that's around getting the balance right between not overreacting to the low risk positives and vice versa.

You'll find many incidentalomas that would never become clinically significant, but would incur recommendations for additional imaging or biopsies, leading to complications that could have been entirely avoided in healthy people. You will also find many things for which we don't know the significance but now may need to follow up with more imaging. \n2. CT/MRI/PET scans are not magical tools that can detect all abnormalities or cancers. Early cancers including colon/gastric/prostate cancer may commonly be entirely undetectable by CT/MRI/PET, not to mention with MRI you need to get even more specific (e.g. prostate MRI requires a different coil and entirely different sequences from an MRI of a different part of the body). There seems to be a common misunderstanding among lay people that if a cancer wasn't called on a CT/MRI, then it was a miss -- without understanding that CT/MRI/PET have their own significant limitations in detecting certain pathologies, and that some cancers may be entirely undetectable by CT/MR imaging. Additionally, different pathologies require different modalities: Early breast cancer detection is most sensitive through mammography and is terrible by CT, early bone metastases can sometimes be only seen on MRI and completely invisible by CT, certain bone tumors are better assessed by radiographs or CT than MRI, etc. \n3. Diagnostic imaging volumes are already exploding, and the current volume of radiologists are already insufficient to read all current studies (i.e. the current radiologist job market is amazing because there are too many exams everywhere). Adding a full-body scan to everyone would lead to volumes where even if every single med student became a radiologist, we would still not have enough. Not to mention, exploding healthcare costs.",

Let's say someone comes in to the emergency room with a headache that sounds pretty benign, and as part of their evaluation they get a CT angiogram of the head, which uses contrast dye to look at the blood vessels in the neck and brain. This is sometimes used in the evaluation of a bad headache to look for a 'leaking' brain aneurysm. When used appropriately, it can be helpful. \n\nLet's say this hypothetical patient actually was just in caffeine withdrawal (which causes headache), but got the CT angiogram anyway. The angiogram revealed a tiny, 1-millimeter aneurysm in a blood vessel. \n\nNeurosurgeons will tell you that small asymptomatic aneurysms like this do NOT need to be intervened upon, and the preferred treatment - usually coiling or clipping the aneurysm - is not without risks. However, because of the medicolegal climate in the USA, many neurosurgeons will say \"well, I can't prove that this patient's headache is NOT from the aneurysm, even though it's small, and I don't want to get sued for not doing something, so I'm going to coil it.\" \n\nCoiling is a pretty safe procedure, but a nonzero percentage of these patients will suffer complications - most seriously, poking a hole in the aneurysm by accident and causing a brain hemorrhage. \n\nWould we catch some cancers early? Yes. Would we also go looking to fix things that don't need to be fixed, and cause harm to patients? Also yes.",

That\u2019s 6 exams, just on one side of the body, 30 minutes each. Not to mention you need to be completely still the length of the MRI. Then you need radiologists to read these things. There\u2019s not enough radiologists in the country to read all those studies. Further more, all that money you claim the insurance company would make? How?  It costs 1000\u2019s of dollars for an exam, and you think insurance will just pay all that? You\u2019d spend 100\u2019s of millions annually to find nothing wrong with people. CT\u2019s and PET just give off too much radiation to be done every year.",

Heart disease/stroke/kidney disease: stop smoking tobacco and get your blood work for diabetes, cholesterol, and blood pressure checked. \n5. Have symptoms that don't feel right? Might be nothing, might be something. Talk to your doctor and have a conversation so we can investigate. Doing a random MRI on your elbow is a waste of time. \n\nAll of the above can be done even earlier if you have a family history. Many things such as chronic infections can even be detected. We have tools to help any substance addiction that can lead to organ failures or cancers as well. Taking care of yourself takes work.

Cost can be outweighed if it saves enough people from undergoing years of expensive treatment and lost time/productivity (also the human cost but insurance companies don\u2019t care about that). And the radiation doesn\u2019t matter as much as we get older.\n\nBut what do you do about false positives?\n\nThis is often overlooked because the focus is finding the cancer at all costs, but consider most people don\u2019t have cancer. Many cancers are very hard to detect early. And the threshold of detection by imaging is sometimes not a much better prognosis than detection from symptoms, examination or other methods (although this is also often not the case). \n\nConsider this: a healthy 50 year old has full body imaging that reveals a possible brain tumor. What do you do now? On one hand it could be cancer and stopping it now could save their life, on the other hand the biopsy to confirm this can cause permanent brain damage. Do you tell them to come back in a year and leave the with the anxiety of not knowing if their brain is riddled with tumors? Do you run the risky procedure knowing some amount of patients will be harmed? That is an extreme case but apply that to all the less risky false positives and you have a real problem. The testing will cause some harm to a large number of healthy people unless it can first be proven to be specific enough.\n\nHowever once it is specific enough you have an excellent way to catch cancer early.

I can definitely understand the desire for a preventative pan-scan to stop problems early, but unfortunately it doesn\u2019t work well - and not just for cost reasons. \n\nThere are safety concerns about repeated CT and PET/CT scans, but most of the issues relate to incidentalomas, false positive results, false negative results, and overtreatment.  \n\nIncidentalomas are benign findings on imaging that still raise enough concern to warrant further work up. That\u2019d be OK except that work up can be invasive and carry a risk of complications.  Even if the next step is to monitor for signs of changing there\u2019s still a meaningful quality of life hit from the worry that the next scan might show something bad.  But mostly it\u2019s the follow-on biopsies that would cause problems.  \n\nFalse positive results would be a step further - something where the imaging or even the followup testing say that something is cancer but it\u2019s actually not. That\u2019s an inevitable risk of any test.  Usually you minimize that risk by only running the test in people likely to have a condition.  But if you take a test - even one that\u2019s 99% accurate - and run it in a bunch of low-risk patients then you\u2019re going to get significantly more false positives than true positives.\n\nFalse negatives are also a problem - though admittedly they would get better if the testing were repeated regularly.  But PET for example is good at showing where tumors are - but only above a given size, maybe 1 cm cubed.  That\u2019s small, and for some tumors maybe that means it\u2019s small enough to intervene, but for some it would already be at a size where the treatment options are limited.  Liquid biopsies that detect circulating tumor DNA could be more sensitive, but they\u2019re targeted to very specific tumors and still have false negatives.  As an aside here, a pan scan would perhaps detect some diseases and especially solid tumors, but a clean scan wouldn\u2019t necessarily tell you about many other significant health problems. \n\nOvertreatment is also a real concern. If you had a perfect test you could probably find prostate cancer in the vast majority of older men.  For most it won\u2019t ever cause a problem, while the treatments can be morbid.  Same for basal cell carcinomas on pale people over 85. This may be less true for younger people with a long time horizon, but there are diseases where, in the wrong patient, the cure is worse than the disease.\n\nThese are some of the reasons why even relatively targeted imaging in relatively at-risk people (think mammograms in women) is often controversial.",

Working up a bunch of incidental non-cancerous findings with additional tests would add to the strain on the system, let alone people who would die or suffer complications from needless biopsies or other procedures.\n\nIn my work I need to have a dividing line somewhere in making a call whether or not something is/could be cancer and needs additional testing, versus it not being worth working up.  Having to draw that line means I will absolutely miss some things during my career that turn out to be cancer. Most of those will be caught on the next study when they \"declare\" themselves and are more suspicious, but certainly not all of them. But on the flip side, if I set my internal sensitivity to 110% and have a happy trigger finger to recommend additional testing on everything I see, I will catch some cancers I might otherwise ignore, but in doing so I'm going to put many thousands of other patients through needless testing, stress, and potential harm. \n\nMedicine is an imperfect science.

Like if you had a scan that revealed something that looked like it could be pancreatic cancer, but everything was fine, you'd want confirmation right? But confirmation here looks like either surgery or chemo, both of which put you at significant risk of harm when you had no symptoms and didn't even know if the thing that came up was a threat to you. Bodies are inherently messy, no-one's is fully perfect. We're all walking around with defects and benign tumours and whatever else - the harm required to confirm their existence and also treat them vastly outweighs the tiny benefit of fixing something that wasn't even causing a bother.\n\nIt's also very expensive, and that cannot be understated.",

[Liquid helium is required to run the superconducting magnets that are used in MRI machines]( https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/perspectives/mso-helium-and-mri-technology). MRI machines are constantly leaking helium and once it escapes into the atmosphere, it is actually so light that it escapes into space and is essentially impossible to recover. \n\nOn the other had, we have no way to make more helium since it is only readily available as a by-product of radioactive decay of uranium and other radioactive materials in the ground. We get it by taking out of natural gas, but only get a lot of it in fairly specific natural gas deposits. Turns out there is a pretty limited supply. We actually currently have a *massive* [helium shortage](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/17/1105970804/helium-prices-are-blowing-up-heres-what-is-causing-the-increase) that is so bad that the government is tapping into its [strategic helium reserve]. \n\nThis shortage is why you might have noticed a bunch of [Party City and other stores closing](https://www.businessinsider.com/party-city-closing-55-stores-as-helium-shortage-affects-sales-2019-8). Until we can come up with superconducting magnets that can provide the same level of magnetic field as liquid helium cooled ones, greatly expanding the number of MRI machines is completely out of the question.",

The patient may be informed of FAI before it's an issue and either elect to take preventative action or wait and see it if becomes symptomatic (but they would at least be aware of it).\n\nSome anatomical variations may not present with symptoms but could inform important health or lifestyle decisions for the patient - but only if they know that the variation exists to begin with. For another example, if there was a non-specific scan that could detect May-Thurner Syndrome, then the patient would be aware before they developed a DVT that they are at higher risk of it - and they may opt to avoid certain activities and/or medications because of it.\n\nMuch of the discussion in this thread has been about false positives as they pertain to masses and the risks associated with biopsying those masses. But what about non-mass-related findings available from these scans? Wouldn't there be benefits from that? \n\nAnd what about in emergency scenarios? Wouldn't an emergency scan be easier to interpret for a patient if they had a history of previous scans?",

A full body scan, which covers multiple zones and organ systems, would take a significant amount of time per person, and there is not an excess of them to go around now. My hospital had a diagnostic radiigist quit during COVID, and has had ti scramble to ousource priority reads on actual sick people. Screening everyone head to toe is not practical, cost effective ( the number needed to treat as well and false positive rates), or warranted from a radiation safety standpoint. MRI significantly moreso ( they take a long tike to perform on single joints/limbs/organs) but the radiation argument is not an issue.",

So we can rule that out for obvious reasons\n\nPET is the same problem as CT, it's radiation so no.\n\nMRI is honestly an amazing imaging tool, it's so good that we use it despite the fact it's so insanely expensive most hospitals have one at best. 0 radiation risk is a massive positive. However, human anatomy isn't rigid, and has a lot of variation. Lots of people have things that ~could~ be cancer on imaging but turn out to be fine. Imaging, without indication, is often useless. So any lump or slightly out of place thing would need heaps of follow up investigations, for most people this would result in more harm than good. And it would be expenno even before factoring the cost of analysing all those films",

Something very important to consider is that more testing will have some impact on how positivity is determined. Skilled radiologists who\u2019ve seen lots of scans are better at spotting cancer than novices. AI trained on big data sets are better than AI trained on bad data. People getting many more scans would have some improvement on the sensitivities of the diagnoses. Would that improvement necessarily cancel out the harm of false positives? No, but it might have some important effect.",

Sure our information and accuracy from the dataset would be immensely useful, but its not a very good reason to increase our accuracy that way - There would be a ton of unintended consequences, which is what the core argument against whole body primary screening is based on (i.e. that scans detect a large amount of changes in the human body which most have no clinical significance or effect on end mortality). A better way would be selective screening based on risk , and improving / assessing detection.. which is what is done already. \n\n\nSources: https://prevention.cancer.gov/major-programs/prostate-lung-colorectal-and-ovarian-cancer-screening-trial\n\nhttps://www.choosingwisely.org/patient-resources/whole-body-scans-to-screen-for-cancer/",

A more sinister interpretation could also be that preventative care is just not as profitable.

With hundreds of millions of scans, who is going to go through these things?  \n\n\nI bring this up for 2 reasons: first is that yes the government, should it ever take over healthcare, could likely save money by doing more diagnostic imaging (maybe).  Second is that AI seems to be getting much better at ruling out false positives/negatives for cancer (for instance, here: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26023-2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26023-2)).

We aren't at that stage.\n\nCT scan devices emit radiation and need to be in special rooms to try to limit the spread of that. Scanning can be fairly quick, but there are many ways to do it depending on what you're looking for so it's not a catchall. MRI you don't have the radiation issue, but it's a much longer scan (think in the range of hour/s) where you have to hold relatively still. \nThe device is even less portable, the magnet is always ON so have to be really careful about ferromagnetic material causing injury, etc. Both devices are expensive to produce AND maintain, and we aren't at the stage of AI reading studies quite yet so radiologists are needed as well. \n\nSo no, it's not just naysayers impeding progress. It's just not worth it currently nor is it realistic.",

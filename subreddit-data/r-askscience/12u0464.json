    "postText": "Both formylmethionine and methionine are coded by the same codon, AUG, so why isn't methionine mistakenly added in the beginning of protein synthesis, or why is formylmethionine not mistakenly added later on?\n\nAlso why do prokaryotes use formylmethionine instead of methionine, and why is methionine used to start protein synthesis in eukaryotes in general?\n\nThank you",

            "comment": "There's a separate initiator tRNA in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.\n\nIn eukaryotes, the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases just put methionine on both the initiator tRNA and internal methionine tRNA, but in prokaryotes the synthetase for the initiator tRNA conjugates it with formylmethionine.\n\nThe prokaryotic system is probably ancestral, with eukaryotes losing the formylation of the initial methionine.",

The first step is deformylation by peptide deformylase, and the second step is identical to eukaryotes, cleavage of the N-terminal methionine by methionine aminopeptidase.",

But natural selection just isn't a robust enough mechanism to generate all this. I don't know what is, but this stuff is *designed*. Just look at the ribosome, or the fungus that turns ants into little robots. \n\nThe more we learn about how everything works, I wonder how obvious it has to get before we admit it.",

            "comment": "DNA contains the genes that encode the proteins and direct cells that build the cognitive architecture in brains during embryonic development. Cognitive architecture and dynamics of brains are a necessary condition to behaviors or abilities. In this sense then yes. But I would caution that to fully address the nuances of this question would involve incorporating understanding from many more disciplines than just biology (neuroscience, cognitive science, epigenetics, etc.) and properly linking them together which is too much for a reddit post for me at the moment.",

Nevertheless, there have been interesting research. \n\nIn an experiment on mice, some were trained to associate the smell of cherries with pain, enough that they exhibited fear in the body and brain when exposed to the smell. Their children and grandchildren, though never exposed to the pain, were also afraid of the cherry smell. It's thought that *something* must have been passed on genetically. Further study might lead to generalizing that instincts, or behaviors, can be learned and passed on through DNA. A caveat, I didn't happen to read whether the mothers were exposed to the smell during pregnancy. \n\nLess related to behavior but still interesting is that in humans, we're finding that starvation at any point increases the risk for offspring to develop diabetes. It's thought to be a survival adaptation, like the fear response in mice. Like I said, it's provacative.",

The point is, that an external factor that triggers an internal response can be passed down as a trait. \n\nIn this case it was the smell of cherries, but it could also be the sound of a car alarm or the color yellow. It has nothing to do with the mutagenicy of the external factor.",

Not much room for anything other than encoded instructions. But we do not yet know very much about the how. \n\nAlso, in more complex animals the drive is often less specific and the behaviour requires some external prompt or teaching. Dogs get into mating without instruction - people can end up screwing trees or pillows.",

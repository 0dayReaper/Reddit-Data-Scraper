    "postText": "As the Covid pandemic has waned, it seems like there is talk of whether many buffets will reopen and if it's \"safe\" for them to do so. Were self-serve buffets a worse place for viral transmission than other restaurants? Especially when compared/contrasted with places like Chipotle, which also has people in close proximity, but does not have people touching serving tools and probably much less ability to cough towards food.\n\nIt seems that initial-to-middle of the pandemic reporting indicated that Covid transmission via food itself was extremely unlikely. Transmission via serving tools, like tongs, could certainly happen, but transmission through the air via aerosolized particles was still the biggest threat.",

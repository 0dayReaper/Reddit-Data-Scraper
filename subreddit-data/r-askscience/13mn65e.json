            "comment": "&gt; As a layman, I understand that earthquakes happen because of plate movement in the crust.\n\nMore of a terminology thing, but plates are blocks of [lithosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithosphere) that are moving, where the lithosphere includes both the crust and a portion of the upper mantle. You are correct that earthquakes reflect plate movement, in short, as a whole plates move steadily (consider this [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/plate_motion_drivers/) entry discussing drivers of plate motion), but largely because of friction, their edges (i.e., plate boundaries) typically display more \"stick-slip\" behavior. Meaning that they do (elastically) accumulate strain near the boundary but the boundary itself doesn't slip until the frictional strength of the fault is overcome, producing an earthquake when this threshold is reached (e.g., the [seismic cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquake_cycle)).\n\n&gt; It is either plates are moving apart, or colliding, or moving under the other one (subduction).\n\nThere are three types of boundaries, but you're missing one of them. [Divergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_boundary) boundaries are where plates are moving apart, forming normal faults. [Convergent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_boundary) boundaries are where plates are colliding, forming reverse or thrust faults, but this effectively is the same as one plate moving under another. Subduction zones are one type of convergent boundary, whereas collisional boundaries between two continental portions of plates are not subduction zones, but still convergent. The one that you were missing was [transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transform_fault) boundaries, where two plates are moving past each other and forming a strike-slip fault (e.g., the San Andreas).\n\n&gt; Which movement is most devastating for our cities?\n\nThere are going to be a lot of factors that play into whether a particular earthquake is damaging. The two most directly related to plate tectonics are the size (i.e., the magnitude) and the depth of the earthquake. Broadly, larger earthquakes that are shallow will have more intense shaking at the surface because earthquake waves attenuate with distance, so waves from shallow earthquakes will attenuate less before reaching the surface. Obviously then also the proximity of a given city to the epicenter of an earthquake is important. It is however worth mentioning that there are other geologic and non-geologic considerations for what makes an earthquake more damaging. For example the nature of the crust in the location of a particular city can either serve to additionally amplify or attenuate seismic waves depending on the details (i.e., [seismic site effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_site_effects)). In terms of damage that occurs, a huge consideration has nothing to do with geology, but is instead the type of construction and whether buildings were engineered with earthquakes in mind. This is generally why, even for largely identical earthquakes in terms of magnitude, depth, and distance to a particular city, countries with strict earthquake-minded building codes tend to have less loss of life than countries with non-existent or poorly enforced earthquake-minded building codes.\n\nUltimately though, your question really is **Which type of plate boundary produces the largest magnitude earthquakes?** A logical place to start is by asking what controls earthquake magnitude? Physically, we know that the size of an earthquake scales with the size of the area/length of a fault that ruptures during an earthquake (e.g., [Wells &amp; Coppersmith, 1994](http://activetectonics.asu.edu/ActiveFaultingSeminar/Papers/Wells_and_Coppersmith_1994.pdf) - note, the magnitude scaling relationships here are a bit out of date, e.g., [Stirling et al., 2013](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article/103/6/2993/331667/Selection-of-Earthquake-Scaling-Relationships-for), but they get the point across). Thus, plate boundaries that allow for larger continuous areas of a fault to rupture at once, can produce larger earthquakes. \n\nFrom the above, we can consider both along-strike (i.e., along the fault in a horizontal direction) continuity and the dip of the fault (i.e., the angle that the fault plane makes horizontal). The along-strike continuity is important because if individual fault segments tend to be short and mostly unlinked, then earthquake sizes are limited by the longest possible segment. The dip of the fault is important because stick-slip behavior (that produces earthquakes) is actually temperature dependent and when the temperature is too high, frictional processes no-longer dominate and faults tend to instead \"creep\", i.e., accumulate slow, continuous movement without earthquakes. This means that faults that have a shallow dip (i.e., make a small angle with respect to horizontal) tend to be able to support larger earthquakes because for the same fault along-strike length, there can be a greater area that is in the \"sweet-spot\" temperature wise for stick-slip behavior.\n\nFinally, if we consider some general characteristics of the three types of faults, we can relate these back to earthquake size. From simple expectations (e.g., [Andersonian fault mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson%27s_Theory_of_Faulting)), we expect strike-slip (transform) faults to have nearly a vertical dip, normal (divergent) faults to have a high angle dip of ~60 degrees, and thrust (convergent) faults to have a low angle dip of &lt;30 degrees. Additionally, what we observe is that normal faults tend to be very segmented, strike-slip faults can be pretty variable in terms of segmentation, and thrusts (especially subduction zones) tend to be able to support very long, continuous segments. If we put all of that together, generally, we expect that normal faults have kind of the lowest maximum possible earthquake sizes (short segments, high angle), strike-slip faults are kind of in the middle (longish segments, high angle), and thrust faults have the largest possible maximum magnitudes (long segments, shallow angle, greatest possible rupture areas).  This is why so-called \"great earthquakes\", i.e., those with magnitudes &gt;9, exclusively happen on thrusts, and specifically subduction zones. That is not to say that either normal faults or strike-slip faults are not capable of producing damaging earthquakes, but we would not expect either of these types to support a M&gt;=9 event.\n\n**In short,** we expect convergent (thrust) boundaries to be able to support the largest magnitude earthquakes, with transform (strike-slip) second, and divergent (normal) to support the smallest maximum magnitudes. These are very general expectations and there are exceptions and all types can definitely produce earthquakes that are damaging (especially given local geologic and non-geologic consideration discussed in the longer answer above), but it is demonstrably true that the largest observed earthquakes have occurred on thrusts and this generally fits with our expectations of the physics and physical limitations of earthquake/fault behavior.",

When I visited there on a field geology four day trip back in 1971, all the roads were dirt. They're paved now.\n\nThere was one mountain on the west side of the valley that had a huge alluvial fan at the base. Two thirds of the way up, there was a clear 'crack' that ran horizontally across the fan. This was caused by an earthquake way back when. It was visible from miles away, so was a really big movement during the earthquake.\n\nVisit Seward, Alaska, and tour their museum of the earthquake from the early 60s. The Prince William Sound near Seward is formed by a big Island called Montague Island. During the earthquake, one end of the island rose ten feet and the other end fell 6 feet, or some dramatic change like that. It sent a tsunami up Resurrection Bay and into Seward. There was a boxcar on the far side of the town that had been picked up by the tsunami and thrown over the town, up into the woods on the side of the mountain.\n\nAll of the nautical charts had to be remade after the quake because the depths were wrong in major ways.\n\nEarthquakes are awesome in the original sense of the word.",

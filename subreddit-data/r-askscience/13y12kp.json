    "postText": "As a child of the 90s, I was taught in science class that nothing decays in a typical US land fill. To prove this they showed us core samples of land fill waste where 10+ year old hot dogs looked the same as the day they were thrown away. But today I keep hearing that waste in land fills undergoes anaerobic decay and releases methane and other toxic gasses.\n\nWas I just taught false information? Has there been some change in how land fills are constructed that means anaerobic decay is more prevalent today?",

Rather than burning on site, this RNG is injected directly into an existing natural gas pipeline, replacing fossil fuel sources of methane. The company I work for builds waste to energy plants and the ROI is very short once up and running. These plants are displacing older flare or medium BTU systems as well.",

This gets taken to a local bin where the company picks it up, processes it, then sells the tithe soil back to the community.\n\nMy question was, if more and more people participate in such a program, what would that do to the landfill over time? Would it still decompose without those organic \u201cstarters?\u201d Or would it just take more time and reduce methane production?",

You divide by 365 days, 24 hours a day, that's instant generation of about 350 MW. So one small-ish gas power plant for a whole country of 70 million people.\n\nThe scale of utility power generation is difficult to comprehend. I remember visiting a biomass power plant, that burned straw. It was going through a thousand tons of straw everyday. I think it was one thousand bales of one ton each, each bale the size of a car (not your typical bale). Obviously a giant operation. And the thing was producing 50 MW of power, so a drop in the water considering total gas capacity in the UK is about 28,000 MW (according to Wikipedia).",

I remember there being a lot of weird orange liquid that would appear now and then after heavy rain, and there was a big lake that had the fish in it dying off every few years. The council always blamed algae blooms. It turned out it was leachate from the old landfill coming out of the ground and contaminating the lake, which has a tributary that runs under the old landfill area. A couple of years ago, the whole thing was redeveloped, and the council basically admitted it was because of contamination from the landfill. On warm days, you could smell it. That being said, my county has 6 disused landfills that were redeveloped in the 80s and 90s. 3 of those are now wildlife areas, and the gasses are vented and flared off. One became the park, and one is undergoing redevelopment into an industrial estate. One is now a solar farm. I think the danger depends on what was dumped and what efforts were made to contain the waste. The leachate from most of the landfills is drawn out and pumped to the local water treatment facilities. I think long long term landfills can be repurposed, but there's probably a lot of variables involved around what was dumped and whether there's active settlement and whatnot.",

There haven\u2019t been many new plants for many years due to the fact that people don\u2019t understand our processes and protest every new project to build \u201ca dirty trash plant.\u201d",

My understanding is that European incinerators are actually quite good and standard practice, but they use scrubbers, filters, taller smokestacks, etc. where the incinerators we have in the States simply do not have adequate controls in place.\n\nSo I agree that an incinerator is a better alternative than a landfill, and is an interesting power generation source, but I wouldn't say that the *only* problem here is lack of education on the matter. People in Baltimore who are organizing against the incinerator know full well that it doesn't have to be this dirty, but the companies that run them seem to be completely unwilling to pay to actually make them a good alternative.",

I believe it was the right thing to do, and the context surrounding it is how bad of a polluter the BRESCO incinerator is to this day. While members of this community will likely never come around on incinerators, even though they *could* be a great waste management tool, I think it's also the case that it has been demonstrated over and over that environmental regulation enforcement will be lax, workers and higher-ups will get negligent and sloppy, and ultimately any new incinerator (no matter how state-of-the-art and carefully designed) will perpetuate the environmental injustices these people have faced for generations.",

The carbon stays in the materials like plastics. By comparison, incineration releases the embodied carbon into the atmosphere. \nWhen modeling for carbon it is typically assumed that incineration results in higher overall carbon. This does not make it worse or better. It would depend on what you are measuring for impacts.",

No garbage trucks.  The municipality has several full time employees at the transfer station making sure you properly sorted your stuff and put it in the right bin/trailer.  They also publish where the different bins are headed generally, and the current price they're paying to dispose of it or (rarely) what they're being paid for it.  The paper, glass and plastic all head to local facilities that put it to use - iirc the plastic is used in the creation of artificial turf, the paper and glass are recycled the usual way.  The organics are burned, the general waste goes to a local landfill which provides methane power and steam generation for a nearby campus.  The waste oil is burned at the transfer station to provide it's heat in the winter, etc.",

Most of the time industrial heterogeneous catalysts experience \"fouling\" (covering with foreign material) or other degradation over prolonged use. Whether or not they can be regenerated depends on the particular catalyst. A lot of enzymes can be irreversibly degraded after only a few uses, for example, and you often experience decent separation losses with homogeneous catalysts. Obviously since expensive rare metals such as platinum and paladium are used in many heterogeneous catalysts, a lot of thought and effort goes into designing reactors to minimize fouling and designing processes to efficiently regenerate catalysts.",

Anything organic will breakdown and the bigger the pile the faster it goes as long as there's oxygen. In a pallet size bin bacteria will break down flowers and leaves in a couple of months, industrial methods with constantly churning and massive piles can break it down in a couple of weeks. Woody material needs fungi and they can take much longer to work. That's why chips are doable but logs will take years.\n\nAnaerobic composting is much slower and much smellier. Sadly this is the main breakdown in landfill. Everything organic will break down eventually but it can take years and will be a much less valuable product.\n\nThe science can be read about here.\n\nhttps://www.acs.org/education/resources/highschool/chemmatters/past-issues/2017-2018/october2017/composting-your-trash-natures-treasure.html",

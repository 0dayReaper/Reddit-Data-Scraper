I know the basics but I am hoping that the more knowledgeable of you can provide more correct answers that I can simplify for him. And any other super cool facts wold be super appreciated!\n\nTornados:\n\n1. How do tornadoes create a vortex?\n1. How are their winds so strong?\n1. How do tornadoes form their eye?\n1. Is the center of the tornado the strongest part?\n1. How do tornadoes crush items that it sucks up?",

            "comment": "This is actually right up my alley as I study atmospheric science and have even done some storm chasing myself. If your son hasn\u2019t had the chance, I\u2019d definitely recommend watching old TV shows like Storm Chasers from  the Discovery Channel or storm chaser videos that come out on YouTube after every big tornado event! Also the weather service has great resources such as [https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/faq/](https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/faq/) with plenty of information. I've left out peer-reviewed sources since I don't imagine they're of much interest to a 7 year old.\n\n1. When you see thunderstorms, you\u2019re seeing rising air fueled with energy from water condensing into the cloud we see. The rising air is called and updraft, and the thunderstorm has to continually suck in air from the surrounding environment to fuel it. If the winds in the atmosphere change direction with height, this can cause the core of the storm to rotate \u2013 a rotating updraft is called a mesocyclone. Now the tricky part is we actually don\u2019t have a complete theory for how these rotating updrafts form tornadoes \u2013 some do but most do not \u2013 and this is a topic of ongoing research! If we could figure this out, it would save many lives.  \nTornadoes rotate because the storm rotates \u2013 it\u2019s an extension of this updraft that reaches the surface. Most of the tornadoes we typically think of are produced by supercells, which are the strongest type of thunderstorm. These storms have towering cumulonimbus clouds, have a rotating updraft (mesocyclone), and are fueled by energy from the sun and water vapor and by strong winds in the atmosphere.Fun fact - a supercell's updraft can carry tornado debris to as high as 30 thousand feet, after which it can fall out hundreds of miles away. Seeing this debris on radar is one of the main ways scientists such as those at the National Weather Service can 'see' a tornado without actually being near the storm and warn the public. The height debris reaches is correlated very well with tornado strength and the strength of the thunderstorm updraft.\n2. The winds in tornadoes are so strong because the winds in thunderstorms are so strong! The speed of the updraft in a supercell can exceed 40 m (130 feet) per second, and air is drawn in rapidly to replace air that has risen. As air is drawn  into a tornado and rotates around it, it speeds up much like an ice skater drawing their arms to spin faster. This is because of conservation of angular momentum. A tornado is basically a tiny low-pressure system (like a hurricane or your sink draining) and the winds increase toward the center similarly.Fun fact - we see clouds in tornadoes (called the condensation funnel) because the pressure decreases and water vapor condenses inside the vortex, but the tornado is bigger than the cloud, and a condensation funnel is not necessary for a tornado to exist and do damage.\n3. Tornadoes are not thought to have \u2018eyes\u2019 in the same way hurricanes do, but the wind speed at the center is 0. If you looked at a cross section of a tornado (see the link in 4), the wind profile in a tornado increases as you move towards the center  \u2013  but it can\u2019t go up forever! Near the center, it turns back towards 0 before increasing again on the other side. Any vortex has a calm center like this!\n4. In some ways yes. The area near the center has the fastest winds, though the center itself has the weakest wins. Observed wind profiles from real tornadoes such as [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167610517301174#fig6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167610517301174#fig6) show this pattern.Typically however, being in the center of a tornadoes path *is* the worst place to be. As a tornado moves, the areas in the center of its path will spend the longest time inside, will experience the strongest winds twice, and will endure a complete 180 degree turnaround in violent winds. This does a lot of damage!\n5. Things damaged by a tornado typically are damaged by other things inside a tornado more than they are by the winds themselves. Most of the damage you see when a tornado hits trees or buildings is from debris picked up by the tornado and hurled around! This is actually a reasonably large issue in determining tornado strength. We rate tornadoes using the EF scale, from the weakest EF-0, to the strongest EF-5, but ratings are given based on damage caused. The widest tornado ever recorded, the El Reno, OK tornado in 2013, was a staggering 2.6 miles wide and is often thought to be an EF-5. Researchers nearby recorded nearly 300 mph winds (EF-5 strength) inside the tornado using radar, but since we officially assess tornado strength by damage caused and the El Reno tornado was primarily in open fields, it ended up with only an EF-3 rating.\n\nI hope this helps, I'd be happy to elaborate or answer more questions!",

The experiment with Dorothy and Dot was actually based on old science. Over the course of three years in the 70s and 80s they would take grad students (because they were expendable) and have them try to drop similar devices  called TOTO (TOtable Tornado Observatory) in paths of tornadoes. Over the 3 years none of them actually worked and they moved on, continuing to advance in so many other ways. When OU saw the final script and realized the out of date science they planned on using, they refused to allow them to use OU as a college. As a way to 'get back' at OU, the only piece of OU seen through the movie is an old hat warn by Dusty, the crazy storm chaser.

For example, in the summer in the US midwest, most of the storms are just convective which just means that air is rising as it's heated.  Add in the right amount of humidity (for the water component) and you can get a storm.  As the air is heated and rises, air is pulled in from elsewhere to fill that void (nature abhors a vacuum after all) and the beat goes on.  Now, when that heated air gets high enough, it cools and falls back down to earth, becoming the air that fuels updrafts.  That's why when you can get that cool breeze on a stormy day.\n\nFun fact:  Google Buy's Ballot Law sometime.  With the wind at your back in the Northern hemisphere, the low pressure is always on your left.

            "comment": "Meteorologist here (MSc), and I can answer question 1 rigourously! For a tornado to form there has to be wind shear: that is, the wind speed and direction has to be changing with height. This creates the initial momentum that causes tornadoes. Then you need buoyancy, to add to the energy that causes tornados.\n\nCareful though -- too much shear, and the system will be \"sheared away\" as We call it, too stretched out to do anything. Too much buoyancy, Though, and it'll collapse onto itself. So Theres this balance between shear and buoyancy (something we call the richardson number, or the BRN).\n\nWhat happens when you get the right mix of shear and buoyancy? A bunch of math happens in the form of the vorticity equation. Essentially, the buoyancy tilts the shear so that instead of vertical shear you have horizontal shear (a difference in wind speed horizontally). Here's a picture of it, google vortex tube tilting: https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Supercell20final-thumb-453x837-103416.png . As it stretches out due to buoyancy, it increases in angular velocity (think of a ballet dancer pulling himself in to increase his rate of rotation), and voila, you have a tornado!\n\nFun fact for your kid, the vortex tube tilting always generates two tornadoes, but generally the left one dies.\n\nHappy to clarify anything here.\n\nEdit: in summary: wind shear creates horizontal angular momentum. Buoyancy tilts that into vertical angular momentum and stretches it out to increase the wind speed and rotation.\n\nAlso edited: angular velocity, not angular momentum, thanks u/geeflexx for catching that",

The structure of supercells is that you have a downdraft in the rear flank. That sometimes happens to be where counterclockwise/right-moving vortex is. This downdraft is so strong it makes the vortex stretch out even more and touch the ground, and that's where you get the strong tornado, whereas the other one dies.\n\nIt's quite a bit more complex than this, but that's the gist of it.",

The top layer is the cold front, the bottom layer is the more humid warm front, and when the cold front is pushing a storm through, it's like the top layer of jello sliding across and down into the bottom layer. As the top get pressed down hard enough the dent between the layer is less like a bowling ball on a trampoline and more like a slingshot aimed at the sky. Those long vertical meeting points are where the tornados form, because as the two layers slide across each other, the rub together a bit, and mix, and start to twist off like a pencil shaving, and since they're vertical, they become a tornado.

There are a few main kinds of meteorology texts: Synoptic scale, Mesoscale, and Microscale (I'm assuming you're not interested in the texts on global circulation or turbulence). Synoptic scale meteorology covers things like weather systems, weather prediction, big storms etc. Mesoscale is where the \"cool\" things happens (as an old professor of mine called it, \"weather porn\"): squalls, thunderstorms, tornadoes, severe weather, orography.\n\nMesoscale, from less to more mathy:\n\n- Severe and Hazardous Weather (Charlevoix, Walsh, Rauber) is a good qualitative introduction to a lot of common mesoscale phenomena\n\n- Mesoscale Meteorology in Midlatitudes (Markowski &amp; Richardson) is a bit more mathy, but still covers many topics well.\n\nSynoptic scale, less to more mathy:\n\n- Meteorology Today, Ahrens. Non-mathematical introduction to synoptic scale meteorology\n\n- Introduction to Atmospheric Science, Wallace and Hobbs. Covers a broad range of topics.\n\n- Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate Dynamics, Marshall and Plumb. Gives a more mathematical treatment of synoptic-scale weather, with videos online demonstrating many of the atmospheric flows.\n\n- Synoptic-dynamic meteorology in Midlatitudes, Bluestein. Quite a good, in-depth treatment, and you'll come away with a good physical intuition.\n\nOne note about these texts, don't feel obliged to go from cover to cover, you'll kill your interest that way. You can pick and choose the sections you're more interested in. And if any of these happen to be too much, no shame in going the next level down :)\n\nHappy reading!",

Shear is harder to get and generally occurs most often in the midwest.\n\nIf you have buoyancy with no shear, you get baby, run of the mill thunderstorms that kinda kill themselves. Keep adding shear though and you'll get more and more intense and long-lived thunderstorms (\"organised convection\", we call it) that can become organised or spawn tornadoes. Too much shear, though, you'll get the system too spread out to do much. This theory is called RKW theory (rotunno, klemp&amp; weisman, 1987).",

            "comment": "Torandos form in the sky first as a horizontal vortex of hot and cold air streams meeting. As it becomes more powerful it turns sideways which is what actually becomes a tornado. Tornados only form when the atmospheric pressure is low enough to allow for the formation of a vortex. The winds are so strong because when the vortex first forms in the sky and begins to create the circular movement of air it acts as a continuous feed back loop where the circle gets larger and larger and it gets faster over time as long as it is still receiving input from the air streams. Similar effect to how if you were to spin a heavy object attached to a string, at first it's slow but as you gain momentum the weight of the object actually helps you go faster.\n\nEdit to answer more:\nThe eye is formed once the tornado is on the ground and is actually the calmest part of the tornado. Inside the eye is an extremely low pressure zone, but almost no wind will be present. Similar again to the ball on string thing I mentioned earlier: if you spin the ball, you only have rotational movement but no horizontal movement, as you go away from the center of the spinning the horizontal movement increases creating high wind speeds.\n\nIn terms of how they crush things: it's usually just objects colliding with the ground or each other in the air. If an object was weak and lightweight it could be effected by the centrifugal/centripetal force but usually the most destructive part is just dragging large objects along the ground.",

I\u2019m sure you all have already talked about it, but they can be extremely dangerous and scary - see, for example, the tornadoes in Putnam County Tennessee earlier this year in March. Lots of people die every year when the proper precautions are not taken or the proper notifications are missed/not effectively disseminated.",

He chases tornadoes, but also helps out with research, has at least one presentation that I can think of, and has a couple of interviews with a meteorologist about research in storm and vortex formation.  Plus he's an amazing guy, very laid back with a great accent and attitude.  Fair warning, he does love critters so if your little guy is afraid of bugs, snakes, lizards, and turtles, he may not like it when Hank pulls over to have a chat with them.",

Looks like there's a chance to ask questions as well. You have to register in advance, but here is the link to the series (scroll down to second webinar listed): https://seagrant.whoi.edu/suggested-educational-resources-for-use-during-school-closures/webinars-noaa-live/\n\nWhat a wonderful thing you are doing, to be so encouraging of your son's interests!",

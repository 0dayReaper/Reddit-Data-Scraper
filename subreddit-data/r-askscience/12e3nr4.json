            "comment": "Airpods receive information from a device as microwaves (a form of electromagnetic wave) between 2.402 and 2.480 GHz. Lightning is a massive discharge of electricity and so will also produce electromagnetic waves. According to [this abstract](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL096214) this includes radio waves and microwaves in the range of 0.03 to 3 GHz. So that means lightning will produce some waves of the right frequency to be detected as noise by airpods.",

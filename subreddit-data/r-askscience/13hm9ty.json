            "comment": "As humans we have about 400 unique receptors which molecules (\u201codorants\u201d) can bind to one or more and activate them. When activated, in concert, we perceive a smell or rather a unique signature which we associate with items. \n\nSmell originates from this chemical binding and later electric signal generation.\n\nEvolutionarily, single celled organisms use a process called chemotaxis to navigate to greater concentration of certain molecules to get to a food source so it\u2019s no wonder that similar mechanisms persist in larger creatures.",

We also know what chemicals our tongue can detect, so we can (mostly) recreate taste.\n\nEssentially, all of our senses break down their perception into discrete channels, and by analyzing these channels, we can reproduce any sensory experience.  \n\nSmell is the exception (and so is taste to the extent that it\u2019s dependent on smell).  There are 3 colors, 1 continuum of pressure, and 5 tastes, but about 400 smells, and we don\u2019t know how they map to different olfactory receptors.",

All that is required is for the compound to be volatile and move through the column. If you can smell the compound, then by definition it is volatile enough to move through the column, you can adjust your temperature accordingly. Most small molecules affecting smell will not break down at  50-80C where you can separate them. The only requirement is that the working temperature is higher than the boiling temperature of the compound to move it into the gas phase. If the compound is so reactive that it breaks down before boiling, then yes you have some problems, but chances are that you are incapable of smelling such compounds anyway.  \n\n\nAs for cilantro, I am not sure at all, but could it be possible that it's taste is changed after cooking because the compounds that give it its distinct taste are evaporated off during cooking rather than being chemically broken down?",

Some people, I think, with a fear of heights (or even no fear), have a very far space in which they perceive things.  While others know they\u2019re high up but are more intimately connected to the immediate space around them.  The latter seems like it would cause far more fear, while the former gives you an open space of the world to not be so scared (or it could also just make you very scared).

For those who don't know, a sense is defined as a receptor that delivers a signal about something in your brain. The receptor for balance is in the ear and the receptor for proprioception is in your nerves (all your body). \n\nWe actually know some sicknesses that take one without the other, therefore they are not lumped: deaf people can still walk, some people can walk but can't touch their nose while closing their eyes, some people can feel they touch something but not feel the heat etc.\n\nThere are probably more senses, because there are sicknesses related, but we did not find the receptor linked to it (sense of time for example).",

While it's definitely a valid question, it wouldn't have even occurred to me to wonder this, so it seems that there's a disconnect between how biologists and laypeople conceive of this. Maybe the reason lies in how biologists have this set of vocabulary for talking about protein behavior that's quite unintuitive for the uninitiated? \n\nOr is it related to an assumption that the concentration of scent molecules that we typically perceive is much higher than it actually is? For example, we can smell particular malodorous molecules at a few parts per trillion. That is to say, even if our bodies were absorbing the molecules that our olfactory tissues bind, it wouldn't really be biologically meaningful.",

What about when you have a handful of pennies in your hand, then you can taste them in the back of your throat. It happens more with other reactive metals iirc magnesium I will taste after handling even for a short period of time. Are we smelling the gasses created, or does it literally react with our nervous system or blood in a way to trigger our olfactory senses?",

(Perhaps a natural resonance due to the shape) and along with the specific receptor being activated, we also detect the vibration. The theory was introduced to account for the fact that isomers of some molecules that activate the same exact receptors, account for wildly different smells.\n\nFor example, the same molecule, but the mirror image, will be either pleasant or something completely different in smell. \n\nCan anyone elaborate on this?",

The story about the formulation of the theory and the main theorist behind it is very well elaborated in the book [The Emperor of Scent](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/14546).\n\nIt's a fascinating read, but I think still controversial as the Shape Theory of smell, which you can read about in many comments in this thread, is still considered orthodox. I believe the Vibration Theory is still considered fringe, possibly because, as the book posits, it poses a serious challenge to the established careers and reputations of many prominent scientists.",

            "comment": "Are you asking if seismic waves can interfere with each other (in a [wave interference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_interference) sense)? Then, yes. While I'm not sure if there's a great reference for your specific question, there are plenty of references out there considering the interference of seismic waves, e.g., what is observed at the antipode (i.e., exact other side of the globe) of a given earthquake (e.g., [Rial &amp; Corner, 1980](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JB085iB05p02661)) or scenarios where different types of [seismic waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_wave) from the same event interfere with each other (e.g., [Zhao et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0926985110000601), [Shani-Kadmiel et al., 2012](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/bssa/article/102/4/1729/325455/Simulation-of-Seismic-Wave-Propagation-through)). For a hypothetical with two distinct sets of seismic waves from two different events interacting, the result will depend on the details of the waves, i.e., there might be constructive interference (i.e., the amplitude of the waves are enhanced) or destructive interference (i.e., the amplitude of the waves are diminished) depending on the offset in phase, amplitude, etc. Similarly, there would likely be complicated patterns as different types of seismic waves interact, e.g., the p-wave from one event interacting with the s-wave from another, and so on, as we see in terms of interference within suites of waves generated by single events (see the Zhao and Shani-Kadmiel papers referenced above). Given that, I would guess that there would be both constructive and destructive interference and that this would probably vary with time as the two sets of waves passed each other at a given point.",

You only really see destructive interference with simple sine wave sources OR deliberately constructed inverted waves (as in noise cancelling headphones.)\n\nNeither of those apply to seismic waves. So although you may get the odd fleeting cancellation vertically, it's far more likely the effects will sum and you'll get more destruction. \n\nThat's actually what the Zhao paper says - two wave propagation modes combine and you get more damage.",

The level of destruction also relates to the length of the earthquake. If they overlap imperfectly, you're having a longer period of shaking. Worst case scenario is when they're almost sequential. Then structures that have been weakened by one are hit by the other before any kind of shoring or escape can happen.",

            "comment": "A person within range of experiencing two simultaneous earthquakes would experience an interference pattern of the two separate quakes. This could lead to the two quakes amplifying each other at that point, or in other cases, the two quakes cancelling each other out in that point. The actual results would be highly unpredictable, as they depend on the particular wave pattern of the two individual quakes as well as the exact location of the person in between the quakes, and the propagation properties of the crust of the earth between the observer and the location of the two quakes.",

            "comment": "Interference is what would happen. The crust of the earth is a elastic medium and an earthquake is a wave traveling in that medium. When two different waves in an elastic medium are in superposition an additive synthesis happens and the interference creates a new waveform that is the sum of both waves local values.",

            "comment": "I remember when I was learning Japanese I came across an old history book which had been badly translated, and it was basically firsthand accounts of historic events described by elderly people pre-WWI.\n\nOne was an old lady describing a massive earthquake which killed her parents in the late 1800\u2019s, and it was roughly translated as a \u201cparent and child\u201d earthquake, meaning there were two epicenters close together radiating at slightly different wave frequencies. She described it as being snapped back and forth like a string on an instrument, where one wave would cause the ground to lurch forward and before that wave was over, the second wave would cause the ground to lurch in the opposite direction. Like being in a ball and that ball suddenly bouncing off a wall you can\u2019t see.\n\nThe buildings in her village all collapsed in a strange way, where the roofs sheared off of the walls, with the roofs sliding off to the right and the walls collapsing to the left, like they had been cut in half. She also mentioned how it gave her permanent vertigo, and she feels sick whenever she sees something moving with the same jerking-shaking motion.\n\nNot the most scientific explanation, I know, but that description always stuck with me, being thrown in one direction and then immediately getting knocked back by an opposite force.",

            "comment": "When two earthquakes happen at the same time but far away from each other, their waves will travel toward the same place where people would feel them. The way the shaking feels depends on how strong and frequent the earthquakes were, how far apart they were, and what the ground is like at the place where they are felt.\n\nIf the earthquakes are similar in strength and frequency, the shaking can become even stronger than either earthquake alone. But if they are different, or far apart, the shaking can be more complex and include a combination of shaking from each earthquake and other effects that can make it weaker or stronger.",

            "comment": "Funny enough, I can offer a real world experience that approximates this. At the time I was living in Canterbury NZ, this was post Canterbury quakes (the several thousand aftershocks were still tailing off from the last major quake) and a fault sequence was primed to rupture to our north. Geologically, the Canterbury plains are essentially deep alluvial deposits that propagate a wave well with several basaltic outcrops that present a boundary layer, the largest being the extinct caldera volcanoes forming Banks Peninsular. \nLate at night in 2016, the Kaikoura quake sequence began with a series of faults rupturing simultaneously resulting in a magnitude 7.8 earthquake. The p, s and t waves propagated easily through the plains and bounced off the basalt of the peninsula with the result being that where I was living was affected by waves from two places at 90\u00b0 to each other. It was wild.\nI can't say much for the wave interactions as I was woken up in a hurry and naked at the time (I wasn't ready for some sciencing) but the experience was that the room, house, and area was attempting to shake in two very different directions at once. Minimal damage for us but I thought I was super drunk for a bit until I remembered I hadn't been drinking. It was a fun ride but went poorly for several thousand people to my north.",

            "comment": "Think about a string held by two people.  Both trigger a vibration on their end of the string.  The constructive interference makes the amplitude bigger than the individual vibrations.\n\nTo make destructive interference.  On one side, trigger vibrations every few seconds.  The vibrations interfere with each other because they are out of phase.  This is the principle of noise cancelling headphones.\n\nEarthquakes can interfere with each other.  Two earthquakes on the same fault at different ends will constructively interfere with each other creating a bigger earthquake in between.\n\nSwarming earthquakes at one point of the fault will cancel each other out\u2026 unless another earthquake at another point of the fault constructively interferes to create a bigger earthquake than the original earthquakes.",

            "comment": "I feel this is one of those questions that comes up precisely because this concept is taught so poorly in schools. Teachers drill into our heads that \"mass doesn't impact falling speed\" and \"the acceleration due to gravity is the same regardless of the mass\" and neglect to teach the limitations of that statement. This is a bit of a tangent, but when I was a TA in college teaching a freshman physics class I would always start the semester asking a variation of this question, and the answers I got were all over the place, and quite wrong. But what I found interesting was that the answers I got were elaborate enough, that it seemed like these students had really thought about this question, but were not given the tools to tackle it.\n\nSo, the very short answer is \"air resistance.\" Which, I'm sure you guessed had something to do with it. The full statement should be \"in a vacuum objects will fall at the same speed regardless of mass\" and that is very close to correct (we'll tackle why even that one is very close in a minute). And I do feel a lot of students have heard that, but even then didn't quite have the tools to answer it correctly. I saw a lot of students wrote things like \"they all fall at the same speed until they reach their terminal velocity\" or whatever, which still isn't true. \n\nSo, we can tackle this with Newton's First Law, which says F = ma (applied force is equal to mass times acceleration). In a vacuum, the only force acting on a falling object, and if the object falling is much smaller than the object it's falling onto, and if it's falling from a height where the gravity doesn't change much over the distance of it's fall, then you can approximate the force of gravity to just be `mg`, where `g` is a constant (on Earth, about 9.8 m/s^(2)). \n\nSo then, we can say `F = mg = ma`, and you see that the `m`s cancel, leaving `a = g`, the acceleration on an object is just equal to a constant, mass doesn't play a role. But of course this is only the case when the only force acting on the object is gravity. When something falls through the atmosphere, there is another force acting on it- drag (or air resistance). Actually calculating drag is a complicated process, but there are two things that matter for this discussion- the amount of drag an object undergoes depends on that object's cross-sectional area (the size of the object as viewed in the direction it is going), the shape of the object (for instance, pointy things have less drag than blunt things) and the speed of the object (the faster it goes, the more drag). Note, the mass of the object is not in here. \n\nThis means that a balloon blown up to the same size as a bowling ball will feel the same drag force acting on it as a bowling ball when traveling at the same speed. But of course, the bowling ball will fall a lot faster. Why? Well, Newton's Second Law comes back to the rescue. \n\nSo now, we can say `F = ma = mg - Fd` (`Fd`- the force of drag- is subtracted from `mg` since it is pointing in the opposite direction). So, since the force of drag is subtracted from the force of gravity, the fastest an object will accelerate is `g` since drag will always make it accelerate less. Also notice now that `m` doesn't cancel out. Instead `a = g - Fd/m`. And seeing this, we now have the equation that shows us how mass plays a role. `Fd/m` gets smaller when `Fd` gets smaller or `m` is larger. And for two objects where `Fd/m` is the same, they will fall at the same speed. So, now if we look at our balloon and bowling ball- the balloon and the bowling ball have the same `Fd` (same cross sectional area, same shape), but the bowling ball's mass is much bigger, so `Fd/m` is smaller, so the acceleration the bowling ball undergoes is closer to being just `g` than for the balloon. \n\nSo, it's important to realize it's not just mass what matters- being heavier doesn't make you fall faster if your size increases as the same time, but all else being equal, it does help. \n\nYou mentioned terminal velocity. Terminal velocity happens where acceleration is zero- that happens when `mg = Fd` (the force due to gravity equals the force due to drag). If you remember, the force of drag increases with speed. So, terminal velocity is just when the object speeds up to the point that this happens. One thing to note, normally we think of terminal velocity as \"starting from zero velocity, and speeding up until you reach this max velocity\" like a person jumping out of a plane. But if you start your decent with velocity (say, a bullet fired down out of a plane) the bullet will still reach terminal velocity (if it's up high enough), but instead it will be traveling faster and slow down to that speed. \n\nOK, and finally, coming back around to something I teased at the beginning- how even in a vacuum, a heavier object will fall ever so slightly faster than a light object. Now, I must warn you, this is such a small effect that you'd never notice it for anything reasonable, but it would play a role if say, the Moon was falling onto the Earth. When an object is falling to Earth, yes the Earth is tugging on the object, but actually the object is tugging on the Earth as well, and what may shock a lot of people- the object dropping actually pulls on the Earth with the exact same amount of force as the Earth is tugging on the object. So, if I drop a hammer on the Earth, the hammer applies the same force to the Earth as the Earth does the hammer- you can get this from Newton's Law of Gravity which says F = -G\\*M\\*m/r^(2) where `G` is a constant, and `M` and `m` are the masses of the two objects, and `r` is the distance between them. Note, the m's are treated the same, there isn't one that pulls and one that doesn't. So, as the hammer falls to Earth, the Earth also rises up to meet the hammer. But, since the mass of the Earth is so much bigger than the mass of the hammer, the acceleration of the Earth is so small, that it is completely and utterly immeasurable. But we know it must be there. But should something like the Moon fall on the Earth, well, that would actually be measurable. So, if you dropped a hammer and the Moon on the Earth, even in a complete vacuum, the Moon would impact the Earth faster.",

We teach it without friction, then go back and re-teach it with friction.\n\nOne way I re-teach this (specifically that mass does not affect terminal velocity without friction) is thru Potential and Kinetic energy conversion.  We use kinematics to calculate final velocity, then use Ug / K, paying spefic attention to how no matter what mass we give the object, the answer remains the same.\n\nTHEN we talk about how much energy might be lost due to air resistance etc.  Then we make an estimate and find the \u201cnew\u201d final velocity.\n\nThen we get to the part where we start actually calculating air resistance and toying with the idea of terminal velocity as Ff approaches Fg, and go from there.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot for most HS students to absorb I think.  And not to mention that MAYBE half of the students from my school who go on to 4 year colleges take Physics in HS at all.",

            "comment": "To give a TLDR answer:\n\nMass doesn't directly affect falling speed.\n\nIt affects gravitonal force, but of course we know from Newton that acceleration is proportional to F/m, so twice the mass leads to twice the gravitonal force, but also twice the innertia, so on total it cancels out, and everything is accelerated down by gravity at the same rate, regardless of it's mass (in a vaccuum, called the Galilean principle)\n\n\nBut, outside of a vacuum gravity isn't the only force acting on a falling object, we also have air resistance, and air resistance **isn't** proportional to mass. Let's say we're at terminal velocity, that means the force of gravity is exactly equal to the force of  air resistance.\n\n\nNow when we change the mass of a thing, the force of gravity changes, because it depends on mass, but the air resistance *doesn't*, so the forces are no longer balanced, the object has to slow down or speed up to become stable again, in other words, the terminal velocity of the object jas changed.\n\nMathematically it's fairly easy to see, \n\nF_grav = g\u00d7m\n\nF_air = C \u00d7 A \u00d7 v\u00b2 \n\nWe reach terminal velocity when both are equal, so\n\ng\u00d7m = C\u00d7A\u00d7v\u00b2\n\nHence \n\nv_t = \u221a{g\u00d7m/(C\u00d7A)}\n\nAnd as you can see, our terminal velocity v_t depends on the local gravity g, the mass m, some constant C\u00b9, and the objects surface area.\n\n\nIf we increase mass and leave everything else the same, the terminal velocity will increase by the root of the mass gain.

    "postText": "I guess they cannot, but is it possible? \n\nThis also begs another question. The other day I was travelling in a train, and I thought to myself, \"if I jump will I land in the exact same spot or will the train pass and I will be in a different spot?\".   \n\n\nAnd ofc, I landed in the same spot. Why did that happen? During my jump I was not in contact with the train, and the train was moving at a fast speed, so why did I land in the same spot?",

            "comment": "So this is a pretty common question, and the really simple answer is Newton's First Law: an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. While you're on the train, you're in motion going forward. When you jump, the only force acting on you is a force up, so you do go up, but nothing pushing you back, so you keep moving forward. \n\nBut this leads to a discussion about how to think about these topics. Think about being on the train. If being in contact with the train is what kept you moving with the train, well then the only place you're in contact with the train while standing is your feet. Do you feel a strong force pushing the soles of your shoes forward as you move along? Since it's not, it can't be the contact between you and the train doing it. However, when the train is first taking off, or when it is stopping, you do feel a force between your shoes and the train. And if you were to jump while the train was braking hard, you would fly forward into whatever was in front of you on the train. This is because of the same law as mentioned above. When the train is at a standstill, you are too, and the only way to get you moving is to apply a force to you. So as the engine applies a force on the train to get it to move, the train has to apply a force to you (if you're standing through your shoes) to get you to move too. Once you're moving, you'll stay moving unless a force acts on you. So, when the brakes apply a force to the train, the train has to apply a force on you to stop you. So, if you're in the air for either of these times, the train can't apply that force, and you'll move forwards or backwards (in the train- really staying stationary as measured by the Earth). \n\nPlanes are pretty similar. If you live in the US the rotation speed of the Earth is around 700 mph (faster down south, slower up north, but on average). Of course, when you go outside, there isn't a 700 mph wind in your face all the time. Because the atmosphere is rotating with the Earth. Plane and helicopters, etc are all flying through the atmosphere, and the atmosphere rotates with the Earth, so just hovering there wouldn't get you anywhere new. \n\nBut even without the atmosphere, the movement you inherit from the Earth matters. For space ships, it's why we like to launch from down south (in the US, we launch from the tip of Florida). Why? Because we get a speed boost- the rotation of the Earth gives our rocket ship a boost. As it takes off, it also has the speed of the Earth's rotation, so once it's out of the atmosphere and needs speed to get to orbit, that speed is gotten \"for free.\"",

                    "comment": "I will admit I maybe missing something here but isn\u2019t the train continually applying a force, albeit small, when it is maintaining a steady speed?  I am thinking that when accelerating or braking there is more energy transfer than when you are at a more or less constant speed and so if you jump while the train is traveling at a constant speed then you do land with a small displacement in the lateral direction from where you started presuming you jumped in a perfectly vertical direction.",

                            "comment": "The continual engine force is pushing against the force of air resistance and the wheel friction force. At a constant speed, the forces are balanced and no acceleration is happening. When you're standing in the train, none of these forces are pushing against you relative to the train. The air inside the train is moving the same speed as the train so if you jump, there's nothing pushing you backwards relative to the train. This is assuming the train is going straight. \n\nIf you were on top of the train, your body is pushing against the air. The train has to do a little bit more work to compensate for the larger surface area of wind resistance. Once you do a jump on top of the train, you are no longer coupled to the force of the engine and are now dealing with all the force of the air \"wanting\" to be relatively still. This force pushes you backwards while you have no equal and opposite force pushing you forwards. The fun part is, if you land on top of the train you now have all the engine force pulling at your ankles again. Better brace for that!",

The similar question I\u2019ve always wondered about came about from watching a fly buzz around the inside of a vehicle, traveling 75mph on the highway.\n\nMy brain can make sense of my body remaining in motion on a train if I jumped, but what about a fly that is airborne for a significant period inside a moving vehicle? Is the fly considered to be flying at the same speed? Is it the interior atmosphere of the vehicle that somehow applies force? Why doesn\u2019t the fly get swatted from behind by the rear windshield even after having no physical contact with the moving vehicle for an ongoing length of time?",

Because the air inside the cabin is moving with the the fly, it's not exerting any force on the fly backwards, just like it's not exerting any force on you, blowing your hair back. If you rolled down the window, then the outside air would interact on the interior of the car, and apply a force to the fly, and it would move.",

            "comment": "That depends on what exactly you mean by \"levitate above ground\".\n\nIf you mean \"remain stationary with respect to some point on the surface\", then by definition you are not going anywhere.\n\nIf you mean \"remain stationary with respect to the air around you\" (e.g. a hot air balloon), then you will continue moving with the surrounding air. If the air changes position relative to the ground, we call that \"wind\" and this is probably not what you're asking about.\n\nIf you mean \"remain stationary with respect to some fixed coordinate system\" (e.g. directions to background stars), then in that coordinate system the surface will indeed move underneath you as the Earth rotates. However, since the atmosphere rotates with the Earth, it will be exerting a steady force on you, and you have to counteract that force somehow to remain stationary in your coordinate system. In simpler words, \"fly\".\n\nIf you mean \"on a planet with no atmosphere, first displace myself a distance above the surface, and then stop any forces other than gravity from affecting me\", then that is a much more complicated problem, and it will depend on what speed are you moving at when you stop propelling yourself. (Do you cancel out your velocity with respect to some coordinate system? Do you keep moving with some velocity but only stop accelerating?) You might fall back to the surface, or you might maintain a stable orbit, which might or might not be geostationary (keeping you above the same point on the surface). You should look up orbital mechanics if this is the case you are interested in.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nIn the train example, you begin moving at some velocity, let's say 60 km/h eastward. Then you jump, applying some force that will move you at, let's say, 5 km/h upward. Velocities are additive at vectors, so after you jump you will be moving at some angle east and up. Gravity will apply a constant downwards force (assuming that the differences in the gravity field due to height and the curvature of the Earth are negligible), which will quickly turn the vertical component of your velocity to negative and you start falling. However, there is no force acting on you in the horizontal direction. (That is, assuming that the train is completely sealed and you don't experience air resistance from outside air -- keep in mind that the air inside the train is also moving at 60 km/h eastward and thus is not exerting any horizontal force on you.) Therefore throughout your jump you will always move at 60 km/h on the east &lt;-&gt; west axis. Since the floor of the train is moving under you with the same velocity, you will land on the same spot you started.",

This air will also push on the drone, but won't impart the full force, since the air can also flow around the drone. So the drone will move back toward the rear wall of the train.\n\nWhether the done actually hits the back wall probably depends on the length of the train, the rate at which it's accelerating, and a lot of complicated fluid dynamics math about how the drone interacts with the air around it.",

For example if you launch a rocket straight up, and look at the \"trajectory\" you will see that in reality the trajectory is a parabola, and this is because even while standing on the ground you are actually moving horizontally at the speed of Earth's rotation.\n\nConsider for a moment what someone sitting on the Moon sees when he looks at you -&gt; that person can see you moving through space as Earth is rotating! So you are in fact moving!\n\nSo this horizontal velocity is always there to begin with. A plane is already moving at this velocity. Yes, you could levitate and wait for earth to move under your feet, but this would require to \"cancel\" the horizontal velocity you already have, which essentially from your point of view would be nothing else but accelerating in the other direction.",

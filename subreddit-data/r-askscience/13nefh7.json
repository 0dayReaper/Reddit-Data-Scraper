This confuses me when I think too hard because my brain is like, \u201cYou couldn\u2019t even count to one trillion in a life time so how could you possibly identify one trillion smells?\u201d Is it just an approximation of possible smells or is there like some list of these one trillion smells somewhere?",

            "comment": "This is a scientific editorial about this. And yes, humans have the ability to discriminate an estimated ~trillion smells.\n\nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/human-nose-can-detect-trillion-smells\n\nThe thing you may be missing to understand is that smell is combinatorial. You, as an average human, have about 400-500 genes that encode olfactory receptors. These receptors are NOT 1:1 with discrete smells though, where receptor 1 binds to (smells) the molecule responsible for smell A, receptor 2 binds to smell B, etc. Instead, each scented molecule binds to a set of receptors in some pattern and the combination of activated receptors makes up the signal to your brain. Your brain perceives what you're smelling, not your nose. From this, we know that there are ~10,000 molecular-associated patterns that can be sent to your brain. [Linda B. Buck figured this out](https://www.nobelprize.org/womenwhochangedscience/stories/linda-buck) and won a Nobel Prize.\n\nBut your brain doesn't stop there. While sure, you can smell a pure molecule. You can also smell multiple molecules at the same time and in different ratios where more or less can be discriminated as a \"different\" smell, even if you can't put your finger or a label on why or how it's different. You can tell though. And so it's this second complex, combinatorial layer that gets to the trillion estimate. See details of the experiments done in the first link.",

I wonder is there a method by which different smells could be artificially produced by mixing known ratios of different molecules. In the same way a colour palette can be tweaked in various ways to produce any colour.",

There is more science in perfume than you would expect, especially since IFRA (International Fragrance Association)  banned or limited so many natural ingredients.  Seems like chemical approximations of scents can be much safer than scents from many plant sources.  So, perfumers often have degrees in chemistry.",

So vinegar is like all off and then acetic acid is way up, and sodium acetate and a bunch of related chemicals and whatever else gets distilled with it from whatever source they use, apples or whatever, are really low and then most others are at 0.\n\nAnd it\u2019s the combinations of smell amounts, so maybe we could distinguish 10 different distilled vinegars by what other components are there in trace amounts, maybe we can tell rice wine vinegar from apple cider from\u2026whatever else.\n\nBut then hypochlorous acid (HOCl) will have the bleach smell, and acetic acid if it\u2019s included to make it, and Cl2, ClO, NaCl, ClO2, NaOH, HCl\u2026\n\nSo they are really saying a trillion of these combinations, and of course most smells in that list no one will ever notice the smell of, some might not even be possible to make, like something with a strong acid and strong base maybe, but it might be on their list of a trillion.",

The relative ratio of smelly compounds in a complex smell can titrate though (add or subtract along a spectrum, with discrimination).\n\nYou certainly could create new smells though.

One eyeball has about 10^8 photosensitive cells in it, and even just treating each one as a binary, monochromatic photosensor, you can already conceive of ~~(10^(8))! possible sights you could see, a number too large to calculate directly, but the answer is approximately exp(1.7\\*10^(9)) (via Stirling's approximation).~~ a number of combinations so vast that your calculator will refuse to give it to you. This ignores the fact that the retina does a ton of preprocessing that is probably lossy, but you get the idea.\n\nIt's not a fair comparison to smell exactly in some ways, but it's the same kind of statement. There's a combinatorial explosion of ways you can stimulate a complex sense like smell or sight. It's a cool factoid but not as crazy as it sounds.",

            "comment": "Chemical bonds are what causes this. Hydrogen forms covalent bonds for H2 but these molecules don't interact with each other that much so it is a gas at room temp and pressure. Helium doesn't form bonds so it's a gas. Lithium can form metallic bonds between many atoms so it's a solid.\n\nIt is related to atomic number because of the charge of the nucleus and the number of elections, but not in a linear way. The most important thing is how full the outer shell of elections is. Elements with the same valence shell are organized into columns on the table. Within this group many of the differences are caused by the radius of the atom.",

            "comment": "If you look at the periodic table you can see a tendency for elements towards the upper right corner to form materials with lower freezing points, so it's not that there's no relation but it's more complicated than you're imagining it should be.\n\nIt comes down largely to the octet rule and the size of atoms and molecules. Atoms generally \"want\" to have 8 electrons (or 2 for the smallest atoms) in their outermost electron shell (meaning that they will be unstable and react with other atoms until that happens), and for elements on the left side of the periodic table, that's easier to do by losing electrons, while for those on the right, it's easier to gain electrons. Losing electrons can only really be done through ionic or metallic bonding, and that results in vast crystal networks of atoms all tightly bound together; hence, a solid crystal. But gaining electrons can be done through covalent bonding, allowing an atom to strongly bond to one or a couple atoms and not with others, forming small molecules that can move more freely; hence, a fluid (and the noble gasses on the rightmost column don't need to bond at all, they're fine as is). Hydrogen is a bit of a special case in that it can either gain or lose one electron, so can pretty freely form either a small molecule or an ionic crystal with other elements.\n\nBut even without strong bonds, molecules can weakly interact with each other, creating forces that may restrict their movement, and larger and more complex molecules will tend to interact more strongly. The fewer electrons an atom needs to gain, the fewer bonds it needs to form, so the elements closer to the right side of the periodic table that need to gain the fewest electrons will more easier form small molecules and so stay as fluids, while those a bit more to the right are more prone to forming larger and more complex molecules (though electronegativity and redox potential counteracts with this a bit, but let's not complicate things). But elements further down the periodic table with more electrons have big atoms and so will form big molecules even with just a couple atoms, and so are also a bit less prone to remain as fluids.",

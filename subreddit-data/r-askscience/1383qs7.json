    "postText": "I presume everyone is used to their own sense of depth, and adjusted to it, and it seems normal to them (because it *is* normal for them). But I've also noticed that stereoscopic images made with a wider parallax result in a 3-D image that appears stretched, deeper, and exaggerated.\n\nIt seems this would hold true for someone with more widely set eyes. If I wore specially designed prismatic eyeware that gave each eye a slightly further off-center view than I am used to, would I get the same elongated sense of depth? \n\nWould this offer an advantage to someone who relies on depth perception, like an NFL quarterback, or MLB pitcher? Would they be able to see more detail with their sense of depth, analogous to stretching out the linear display of a soundtrack, with sound editing software?",

Moving the eyes apart changes where that overlap starts to occur, but the sightlines are still parallel. \n\nThe reason it doesn\u2019t make more of a difference is because the angles of convergence (When you move your eyes inward to focus on an object) are very small, less that 1\u00b0 per eye, until you get to within a 2 meters in front of you.",

(the OP's examples of NFL quarterbacks and pitchers, etc would not be as helpful, but certainly for closer observations it would be.)\n\nAs well, even in the long distance case, one thing where a small increase in IPD will make a difference is when the subject being observed is at a large distance from their background (think of the pitcher observing the 2'nd baseman with the outfield wall behind)  Using the common assumption of resolving power of the eye being 60-arcseconds, someone with a larger IPD of say 66mm versus a 60mm IPD would have close 60 arceseconds of angular difference in extra occluded detail of the wall behind the second baseman, and their brain, would combine that with other depth cues to give them a better ability to estimate the distance of the second baseman from the back wall than the person with a 60mm IPD.",

If you are looking right through the centre of the lens, the image is very clear, if you look closer to the edges, the images becomes blurry with some chromatic aberration, the same thing occurs if you put the HMD too high or too low on your face. So much like getting the alignment right with binoculars or a microscope, its not about 3D vision, its about getting the lenses aligned so the light rays go in to your eyes as intended.",

                    "comment": "I did not study optics, but I spent decades on experimental photography. Lately, I got deeply invested in stereo photography.\n\nI make a lot of stereo photos, and I need tune the distance between the cameras to get the sense of depth right for the depth of the scene. It is a very important variable that makes or breaks the result. When space too far apart for the distance, the image breaks apart. If the cameras were too close to each other, all the things in the back seem to be in the same plane, as one backdrop. If I'd photograph a scene where everything is further away than 15 meters, with the cameras spaced 60mm, without any visual cues in the foreground, I would end up with two photos that are the same. No stereo effect at all.  \n\n\nIf I want a sense of depth that goes beyond 15 meters, I need to space the cameras further apart than human eyes usually are. If I want to incorporate the sense that the moon is not in the same plane as the church on the horizon, I space the cameras as far as 10cm apart. Same with clouds behind the horizon, with trees on the horizon.\n\nI can't vary my own IPD but from what I learned from photography, I can see more objectively. I can see that my depth perception is getting less at 15 meters and is pretty much gone at 20 meters. But here, visual cues take over. I know streets have depth, so I know that shop signs,  lamp posts and other street hardware are spaced behind each other, and the houses tell my by how much. If I photograph this, and space the cameras so far that the cameras do get a slightly different perspective beyond 20 meters, the image becomes hyperreal. Which is an amazing effect, by the way.  \n\n\nSo I would answer OP with an enthusiastic yes. At infinity, it wont matter, but the variation of 50mm to 80mm matters a lot for the depth perception from 10 to 200 meters. 100mm pushes this perception to hundreds of meters.",

If that is the case, there is at least some degree of depth perception possible under good conditions out to 350-560 meters away.\n\nEven the depth of field from *one* pupil is severe enough that the \"near\" field, defined as the distance where the smallest resolveable detail is smaller then the aperture, extends out quite far.

The eyes will provide 2 larger angles of view from each eye from each other.  The brain will recognize the disparity between the object if interest from the background.  Of course if the object is a spot of light suspended in darkness, depth perception is more difficult.",

This comes from simple geometry. At longer distances we rely on other visual clues, such as known or expected object size.\n\nFrom geometry, you can justify that at reading-distance your depth perception precision is around 1/7th of your 2D perception/resolution.",

            "comment": "Your question made me curious and a quick search yielded the study linked below, which looked at exactly this question.^1 The researchers found that the answer depends both on the variant of the exercise as well as the stage of the exercise. For example, in a traditional push-up the number is about 69% in the up position (at the top of the movement) and 75% in the down position (bottom of the movement).\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the study also looked at a \"modified push-up.\" This modification [as shown here](https://i.imgur.com/2PagQIv.png) is essentially just an ~~lazier~~ easier version of the exercise where the knees stay on the floor.  Surprisingly (to me at least), even in this simpler version you still lift quite a bit of your body mass (54% in the up position and 62% in the down position).\n\nedit: I corrected \"going up/down\" to \"up/down position\" to reflect the fact the body was kept stationary when the force was recorded in this study.\n\n^(**1**) Suprak, et al. **The effect of position on the percentage of body mass supported during traditional and modified push-up variants.** 2011: 25 (2) pp 497-503 *J.

While the weight *may* be the same, weight distribution and the type of movement are not. There are two kinds of kinetic chain exercises: open and closed. \n\nIn open kinetic chain exercises, the segment furthest away from the body \u2014 known as the distal aspect, usually the hand or foot \u2014 is free and not fixed to an object. \n\nIn a closed chain exercise, it is fixed, or stationary.\n\nA squat, for example, where the foot presses against the floor to raise the body, is a closed chain kinetic exercise. Using a leg curl machine, where the lower leg swings freely, is an example of open chain.\n\nA shoulder press is an open chain exercise, while the handstand pushup is a closed chain exercise. \n\n\n\n",

In highly trained individuals, they might exceed the deltoids, but both are large muscle groups. The reason people are able to lift more in a bench press than a shoulder press is due to better leverage and incorporation of more muscle groups in a bench press.",

The energy used to lift a kangaroo is so high it is impossible to get enough energy in a day of eating to power a day of jumping to find the food in the first place.\nBut a kangaroo only spends that much energy on the first jump of the day. At the peak of a jump that kinetic energy has been converted to potential energy. The kangaroo drops its neck and tail. Storing a crap load of that potential energy as muscle energy, reusing it on the next jump.\nKangaroos are an extreme example to demonstrate the point but similar (if less efficient) processes are at play with human bodies. A baby weighs the same awake or asleep but every parent will tell you carrying a sleeping baby is much more fatiguing than carrying the same baby awake. That's because sleeping the baby really is dead weight. Awake the baby holds on to you, so you don't need as much energy to prevent her slipping out of your arms. She is providing some of the energy for you. Be careful applying basic mechanics to living bodies - they are hugely complex and highly efficient machines that do not operate as simple physics would predict unless you account for all their energy saving, storing and reuse systems. Kangaroos do jump and bumblebees do fly even though simple mechanics says both are impossible. ",

Do what you enjoy.\n\nHowever, something for you to consider...\n\n&gt; I asked for a trainer and he had me lift just the bar. I struggled with that even. \n\nVery common issue. Consider the following two programs:\n\nhttp://www.startbodyweight.com/ &lt;-- build basic strength\n\nhttps://stronglifts.com/5x5/ &lt;-- this program is amazing and starts with an empty bar\n\nDoing either of the above (or starting with the bodyweight one and then progressing to SL) will give you more strength than machines. Machines exercise muscles in isolation -- they came from physical therapy programs in the 1960s and 1970s and were never originally designed for mass fitness use. They were adopted by gyms for marketing reasons, because it is \"safer\" but that is an illusion. You get stronger, but you lose out in training the ability of the muscles to *work together as a whole*.\n\nThis is important for things like catching your kids when they fall, etc. :)\n\nThe bodyweight program is based on gymnastics and teaches incredible body tension and strength, and starts *extremely* easy -- wall pushups etc.\n\nStrongLifts has you start with the empty bar on all exercises, and specifically addresses how to handle not being able to lift the empty bar. Basically, do machine or ideally dumbbell exercises to build up until you can, or use a lighter bar to start with. Switch to the full 45lb oly bar as soon as possible.\n\nSL also takes an *extremely* serious approach to focusing on form and taking things slow, one step at a time. This helps avoid injury.\n\nThe reason it is called 5x5 is because you do 5 sets of 5 reps of each exercise. Each day you only do either 2 or 3 exercises, so you can be done in 45 minutes.\n\nUnder this program you can go from squatting the empty bar to squatting 1.5x bodyweight in 6 months. As in an extra 1.5x your bodyweight resting on your back. Seriously.\n\nJust imagine how easy it will be to handle the kids and baby carriers then. And how much stronger and safer you will feel as the parent knowing you are much more stable on your feet and able to handle a wider variety of problems that may pop up, helping keep them safe. Just something to think about. :)",

Getting stronger faster means less time in the gym, so it's actually the laziest way to achieve the goal of getting stronger. Putting a little work into learning a good workout plan is going to save you a lot of wasted time in the long run. Or you could just commit to the fully lazy path and not work out at all. Either works.",

You can't discount the weight of your hands because they're touching the ground. When you step on a scale and only your feet are touching the scale the scale is still measuring 100% of your weight, not 100% of your weight minus the weight of your feet, right?",

Ideally your arms should be bent at around a 25 degree angle.",

I find that it comes down to technique, both in the push-up and in the bench press. \nIf you do the push-ups with poor ROM and/or with poor stabilization in the core then they are going to feel light. If you do them strict then you have to be very strong to bang out many of them. \nIf you bench press with your feet planted on the floor, arch your back and make sure to use the correct muscles then bench press will feel easy. If you do the opposite they will feel hard. \n\nWithout having seen either technique I would guess your push-ups either have short ROM or lack stabilization and your bench press needs more technique work. Just a guess since you asked. ",

                            "comment": "Weight distribution will have an effect, as the way to calculate the force required to do a push-up depends on where a person's center of mass lies. In push-up position, there are two areas supporting weight, hands and feet, and in this problem we are interested in how much of the weight is supported by hands. The closer to the hands/shoulders a person's center of mass lies, the more direct force they would be supporting during the push-up. Another way to think of it would be to picture placing a large weight on a person during a push-up. If you put it right on their neck/shoulders, the hands would take on most of the weight. The further down the back/legs you place it, the more the feet take some of the force.  \n  \nSo anyway, a rather skinny person with large shoulders and arms would be supporting a larger % of their weight than an otherwise skinny-(ish) person with a large belly or huge thighs.  \n  \nKeep in mind this is a gross simplification, there are also bio-mechanical factors involved, including some moment (torque) forces made greater by moving the center-of-mass away from the arms. These forces would need to be countered by the wrist/shoulders. ",

I got the pushup thing covered.\n\nFor training, you go VERY slowly. Resistance training. Its a misery.\n\nWhen testing for a high score (high repetition count in a short time frame), you set a fast rhythm. So basically fall, bounce, snap back up (like a two armed punch), fall, bounce, repeat.\n\nThe falling is more efficient as you, with practice, are essentially relaxing those major muscle groups for the 1/8 of a second or so it tales to fall and bounce.\n\nhttps://usarmybasic.com/army-physical-fitness/apft-standards\n\n",

As you go down, the angle (measured from the floor under you to your body) is decreasing. In this case, your angle starts at (guessing) about 20 degrees, and decreases down to about 10. In this case, as the angle is decreasing, the cosine function is increasing.\n\nSo the force you are carrying is increasing as you go down, and decreasing as you go up. It is at a maximum, when you are ending your downward decent, and starting to push upwards. So it makes perfect sense that pushing up would be the harder part.",

                    "comment": "Correction, the linked study does say this, but in your wording you make it seem like something else. The study says you're supporting less weight in the \"up\" *position* than in the \"down\" *position*. In other words, the weight on your hands at the bottom of the pushup is different than it is at the top of the pushup, which would be expected, and that weight decreases as you push up, then increases again as you go down. However, at a given point, say halfway up or halfway down, the weight is the same whether you are moving toward or away from the ground. A nice way to imagine why this is is to imagine a giant clock, where the minute hand is broken and now moves freely around the pivot. If you hold the tip of the minute hand when it's in the 9:00 position, you're holding up a portion of the minute hand's weight. When the hand is at 12:00, you're holding none of the hand's weight. As you move between the two, the amount of the minute hand's weight that you're holding, versus the pivot in the middle, changes. Your body is the same, but in a push up, you're moving between 9:00 and, say, 10;00.",

With your hands together, you're slightly higher off the floor, which changes the angle of your body relative to the floor. The change in angle changes what % of your body weight your arms are supporting. It wouldn't be a huge difference since it's only a slight change but a difference none the less.",

I know many people aren't aware of this and truly feel like they are doing them correctly.  67 is a solid number of legit pushups, I'd expect your bench to be higher.  Easy to film at home and check.  Sorry - I'm a nitpicker at pushups having been through a school where were tested on pushups and they had to be right on test day or they didn't count. Not saying yours are wrong - just something to look at.",

It's easy to find people who can do 20 push ups but can't do a single 70% body weight bench press, and many many more who can't do 20 of them. If someone starting out spends some time (3 months) trying to increase his 1 rep max then 2 weeks stamina training he will most likely manage to do more push ups than a guy that just did stamina training with a weight he managed to press as often as many push ups he could do or alternatively the 70% bw. Interestingly enough there are non responders to cardio training and non responders to HIIT (in most cases if you are one the other works fine, and for most people one is better than the other, in most cases HIIT) but I have never found a study that found non responders to weight training (1-15 rep range) with the exception of people with real conditions.",

Since the points where your muscles attach should also have longer levers when you are larger it should all even out.\n\nSecond moment of area (area moment of inertia) increases with length squared, so you should indeed have a harder time accelerating or stopping your limbs.

            "comment": "As you have your answer which will depend a bit on your body design but is easy to find with your hands on a scale, I'll add there's some use with that number (actual number, not percentage). You can make it higher by elevating your feet or lower it by using books or chair. However, don't make the angle too extreme as you change the exercise.\n\nOther methods make the exercise more difficult or easy by changing the balance and leverage. Hands closer together is harder than hands further apart (also shifts whether you use the chest or triceps more). When you shift width of your feet, only the balance is affected. Also, there a range of motion to consider. Usually, your max range is from \"chest to ground\" to \"arms locked out\". This ground part can be deepened using handles or books. Anyway, making the range of motion shorter (going only parallel, bit of bend of elbows) makes things easier as your going less distance.\n\nI'll also add that while it's tempting to just get higher and higher reps, consider having a cap where after that you start adding weight (placed on your back, weight vest, straps, etc) after you've reached a specific goal of reps/time. For example, if you're doing a \"Tabata\" method that's 15 seconds of reps/ 15 seconds of rest for 10 rounds (2.5 minutes rest, 2.5 minutes work) and full range of motion and you're doing this every other day. If you can reach 120 reps total, add five pounds total to your back for next exercise. When you reach 120 after so many days, again, add 5 pounds. If you ever get up to 25 pounds, for fun try it with 0 and be amazed at how fast you knock out reps.",

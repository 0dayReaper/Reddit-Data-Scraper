    "postText": "Welcome to our weekly feature, Ask Anything Wednesday - this week we are focusing on **Biology, Chemistry, Neuroscience, Medicine, Psychology**\n\nDo you have a question within these topics you weren't sure was worth submitting? Is something a bit too speculative for a typical /r/AskScience post? No question is too big or small for AAW. In this thread you can ask any science-related question! Things like: \"What would happen if...\", \"How will the future...\", \"If all the rules for 'X' were different...\", \"Why does my...\".\n\n**Asking Questions:**\n\nPlease post your question as a top-level response to this, and our team of panellists will be here to answer and discuss your questions. The other topic areas will appear in future Ask Anything Wednesdays, so if you have other questions not covered by this weeks theme please either hold on to it until those topics come around, or go and post over in our sister subreddit /r/AskScienceDiscussion , where every day is Ask Anything Wednesday! Off-theme questions in this post will be removed to try and keep the thread a manageable size for both our readers and panellists.\n\n**Answering Questions:**\n\nPlease only answer a posted question if you are an expert in the field. [The full guidelines for posting responses in AskScience can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/index#wiki_answering_askscience). In short, this is a moderated subreddit, and responses which do not meet our quality guidelines will be removed. Remember, peer reviewed sources are always appreciated, and anecdotes are absolutely not appropriate. In general if your answer begins with 'I think', or 'I've heard', then it's not suitable for /r/AskScience.\n\nIf you would like to become a member of the AskScience panel, [please refer to the information provided here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/about/sticky).\n\nPast AskAnythingWednesday posts [can be found here](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/search?q=flair%3A%27meta%27&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all).

Males develop from unfertilized (haploid) eggs, and females from fertilized (diploid) ones. \n\nCaste determination in among females (ie, queen vs the variety of non-queen castes among different species) is physiological. Somewhat biased by genotype in some species but in a minor sense. The variety of environmental factors here is huge: larvae nutrition, average temperature, chilling while the eggs are still in the ovaries in some species or already larvae in others, endocrine signals from the amount of queens already present (called caste self-inhibition), egg size, the age of the maternal queen, etc. \n\nIn the larval stage the process materializes as the determination of what point in development the larva is \u201chalted\u201d. Genetically female eggs which, for any number of the reasons above and generally many of them, are halted at certain checkpoints in development become workers, and those which continue become queens.",

For instance, \n&gt; Genetic tetrachromacy means that a person has two different genes for their photopigments, both active at the same time. Up to 12% of people with two X chromosomes may have the condition. With a copy of OPN1MW on one X chromosome and a copy of OPNMW2 on the other, it's possible for a person to have four separate and functional cones in their retina, instead of the usual three. But the cones' response ranges overlap, so the same wavelength of visible light can saturate more than one receptor. This may explain the visual differences characteristic of this type of tetrachromacy. People with the condition can make finer distinctions between shades, because they have more combinations of color receptors to do it with.\n\nThe quoted resource also backs up my statement that tetrachromats can differentiate additional shades of color within the established human visual spectrum. [Source](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/331169-human-tetrachromacy-is-real-heres-what-we-know)\n\nSince female tetrachromacy and male color-blindness are carried on the X-chromosome, both seem to be variations in one (or only) X-chromosome that shift the frequency sensitivity of one of the color cones. [Source](https://research.ncl.ac.uk/tetrachromacy/faqs/)\n&gt; The best way to identify potential tetrachromats is by looking at maternal male relatives. From our research so far, we know that the most likely candidates for tetrachromacy are those who carry the gene for very mild colour vision deficiency. This means that their son/father/maternal uncle/maternal grandfather etc. will be very slightly colour blind.",

So, regardless of how fantastical or compelling anyone\u2019s statements about this seem, invite them to prove it, because so far nobody has been able to do so.\n\n&gt;\tOkay, but can their brains actually process that information as a different color?\n\nThe idea of human tetrachromats having improved color perception, or even vision that is different at all, arises from a misquoting of Dr. Jay Neitz, a well-known and respected researcher of color vision and related disorders. The \u201c100 million colors\u201d thing is a pop science myth, unconnected to Neitz except by an article from 2006 in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette which quoted Neitz a few times and connected his ideas from an earlier paper to the 100 million colors idea as if one supported the other. Neitz mentioned the idea of hypothetically calculating the limit of color perception based on the number of photopigments in the observing optical systems, with the traditional limit of human color perception with our dichromat eyes (2 pigments) extrapolated to three and then four unique photopigments. At no point did Neitz say anything in support of this myth that human tetrachromats are known to have improved color perception.\n\nThe PPG article:\n\nhttps://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2006/09/13/Some-women-may-see-100-million-colors-thanks-to-their-genes/stories/200609130255",

That is more limited to finding suitable participants and not a statistical measure of the population.\n\nThe camera question is more difficult and needs some colour theory.  Your eyes detect hue, saturation and luminance.  Your eye receptors are also leaky - the detect a range of wavelengths.  It's not like a laser only detecting 450nm, your eye detects what is called a \"colour space\" or a range of wavelengths.  \n\nThe tetrachromat viewers would see a digital image with a different *luminance* but not different colours. It would appear some of the pixels are brighter than the rest, as if they have a brighter lamp behind the color. Some parts of the image will appear more intense, an effect is similar to wearing tinted sunglasses or polarized lenses or even some people who have lazer eye correction and are challenged seeing more blue/near-UV light.",

                            "comment": "Not sure about our about our progress on aging but Alzheimer's is a tricky disease. It has a couple characteristics that make it challenging to figure out. \n\n1. It's in the brain. The brain is difficult to work with because it's incredibly complex (billions of neurons with trillions of connections), has a barrier to keep drugs out, and is so important we can't take biopsies.  For most cancers, we can easily access them (lung, breast, prostate, colon, etc) to take biopsies. Do studies on those biopsies and figure out what's going on. For Alzheimer's disease, while it'd be really helpful to take biopsies and figure out what's going on in the cells while people are still alive, we can't just take a chunk of someone's hippocampus out because it could affect their functioning. So we need to use models but no model is perfect (mice and rats just don't get Alzheimer's on their own) or we can use post-mortem tissue but that's like trying to solve a burglary that happened a decade or more ago. Finally, the blood brain barrier makes designing drugs to access the brain really difficult. So even when we do have promising drug candidates, its takes even longer to figure out how to get them into the brain.\n2. Its a really long disease. After diagnosis, people live between 5-10 years but can live up to 20. And we know that the disease starts about 5-10 years *before* diagnosis since people generally don't get symptoms until their has already been neurodegeneration. So trying to stop something that takes literal decades to happen makes the logistics of clinical trials really difficult. These trials require years to determine if the drugs are affective which isn't just lengthy but also insanely expensive. And the most effective time to be treating people isn't after diagnosis but 5-10 years before diagnosis when they don't have symptoms. So how can we even find these people? \n\nDespite these challenges we are making (slow) progress. We have a much better understanding of the disease now than we did 10 years ago and funding for research is at its highest level ever. The NIH allocated $2.4 billion in 2019 which was the second highest funding rate for a disease behind HIV/AIDS. I don't think we'll find a cure soon but I'm hopeful we'll find some therapies that will help slow disease progression in the next 10 years.\n\nProgress in AD drugs - [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-019-0063-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-019-0063-8)\n\nNIH funding - https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2775642",

The experts in this field, like the power users on /r/longevity, for some reason seem to love ignoring this critical problem at the heart of the field, but until that problem is resolved there is no logically consistent way to say someone is \u201cstopping aging\u201d.\n\nWhat often happens is some development is made in combatting some disease associated with aging (like atherosclerosis or insulin resistance), and then it\u2019s hailed as an anti-aging treatment. This is in stark contradiction to the position of the longevity folks themselves, since the basis of their argument is that aging is some unique process *underlying* those age-related diseases, rather than an emergent phenotype which integrates them (and other characteristics of an aging organism), which is where the rest of biology generally stands.\n\nFor example, lots of them promote metformin as an anti-aging drug for its generally successful but somewhat debated efficacy against insulin resistance and resultant diabetes. However, that would mean metformin is an anti-diabetic therapy, not an anti-aging therapy, since according to the longevity folks IR and diabetes are symptoms of aging, not the other way around.",

Changing the way you live is really difficult because it requires motivation, drive, energy, and sacrifice every single day. If you're already stressed at work, taking care of kids, dealing with home repairs, and refinancing debt then figuring out the weight of your chicken to properly portion it just isn't a priority. Or perhaps you're stressed at the end of the day and a burger is the one thing you look forward to. This person has a sincere desire to lose weight but figuring out how to work it into their life is challenging. It doesn't make them selfish or delusional. \n\nThe same thing can be said about climate change. Just swap out having a burger at the end of the day to having a cool house to return to. Or being able to get new clothes. They do hold a sincere belief about stopping climate change but life is messy and sometimes these long term goals aren't a priority.\n\nNow I'm not saying that these things *shouldn't* be a priority because they should be.

The ratio of those in the hair fibre gives you all the colour combinations of human hair.\n\nAs you age, [the hair follicle starts to produce *hydrogen peroxide* that bleaches those pigments](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090223131123.htm#:~:text=These%20researchers%20show%20that%20going,melanin%2C%20our%20hair's%20natural%20pigment.).  Typically your cell is generating hydrogen peroxide and also an enzyme to destory the peroxide.  It's part of how the cell repairs itself.  Older cells stop generating the enzyme, leaving excess hydrogen peroxide to bleach your hair pigments.\n\nAt the start it is only on the outside of the hair fibre, but as you age it also bleaches the inside of the fibre.  Gray -&gt; white.\n\nAnalogy: turning down a dimmer switch.\n\n&gt; I'll find a hair that's white along the older half and dark brown at the root.)\n\nYour hair has 3 phases of growth.  Sometimes it actively is growing longer, other times it is resting and not growing, other times it is preparing to die/regrow a new hair.\n\nIndividuals will generate different amounts of hydrogen peroxide and enzyme and hair growth.  Overall it is sometimes called a \"melanin clock\", but simply the behaviour describe of partial gray hair fibres is reasonably common.",

It is only done when the emissions are toxic or nuisances that result in fines.\n\nFor some types of waste the emissions also need to be captured.  For instance, wastes that contain heavy metals or reactive chemicals.  It's easier to keep those in solid/liquid form and treat specially.",

                                    "comment": "&gt; there needs to be a supplemental power source, but it seems like a viable solution\n\nApologies if my written words sound cruel, I'm trying to be brief.\n\nIt is only viable for hazardous and expensive waste.  There are only FIVE operating units for waste disposal in use globally.\n\nIt is completely nonviable for conventional waste.  It is competing with landfill, incineration, sorting and other waste treatment options such as anaerobic digestion, pressure digestion or chemical treatment.\n\nIt is far cheaper to sort mixed waste into hazardous and non-hazardous, transport both to separate treatment facilities and do other boring conventional waste treatment.\n\nPlasma gasification only really works when you have almost zero land/work area, very dry wastes, minimal construction material, excess cheap electricity, extremely tight regulations on emissions, lots of highly trained engineers and maintainers because these units need lots of attention.\n\nIt is perfect for disposing of medical or hazardous wastes, but those are really small volumes, all things considered.  A problem is it is really challenging to find enough of those wastes to keep the plasma running!  That requires putting in sub-optimal feedstocks or charging a lot for occasional use.  Nobody wants to create a centralized hazardous or medical waste facility because of NIMBY (c.a. nuclear waste), so it's almost impossible to justify building a large enough plasma facility to be economical.\n\nIt is not suitable for post-consumer waste or domestic waste.  It really only works with large controlled industrial/agricultural wastes that have consistent ingredients.  And those wastes usually have value that can be better extracted in other ways (such as anaerobic digestors that are net energy positive).\n\nIt's just too expensive and too niche compared to other options.",

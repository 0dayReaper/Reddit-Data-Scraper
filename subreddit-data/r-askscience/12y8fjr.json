            "comment": "The energy involved in melting fat is well below the point where molecular bonds (at least those in fats) start to break.\n\nThe reason why unsaturated fats have lower melting points is that unlike straight-chained saturated fatty acid, the double bonds inside (cis-)unsaturated fatty acids [introduce a kink in the carbon chain](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/19/Rasyslami.jpg). Those bent chains cannot pack together as neatly as the straight chains of saturated fats, and so it takes less energy (and thus a lower temperature) to break them out of a packed-together solid structure and melt them.",

                    "comment": "Yes, and furthermore I'd like to mention the intermolecular energy between the carbon chains.  There is an attractive force, an energy you can measure in calories, between the chains, holding them together.  The more surface area they can get in contact, the more calories of force there is holding them together.  Applying heat energy, which is also calories, can overcome the intermolecular forces and cause melting.\n\nThe double bonds which kink the chains cause less surface area from touching between chains, reducing the calories of attractive force.  You need apply less calories of heat to cause melting.",

            "comment": "Double bonds do require more energy to break, but you aren't breaking them when something melts.\n\nMelting is when the different molecules start to move around each other rather than being solidly packed together.\n\nThe double bonds can't rotate, so molecules with those in can't pack as tightly together. This makes it easier to separate the molecules, so a lower melting temperature.",

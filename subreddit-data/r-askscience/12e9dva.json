The collaboration with Norway-based global cattle breeding association Geno will simulate 500,000 animals, providing industry credibility. By optimizing feed efficiency and reducing methane emissions, this research could have a significant impact on agriculture's greenhouse gas emissions, which account for about 14.5% of the global total.\n\nSelective breeding and genetic modification are both very slow and expensive processes, so researchers are also experimenting with special feed and additives that can reduce methane emissions.\n\nSome examples:\n\n* [Carbon Farming: Reducing Methane Emissions in Cattle Using Feed Additives](https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/climate-change/carbon-farming-reducing-methane-emissions-cattle-using-feed-additives)\n* [Feeding Cattle Seaweed Reduces Their Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 82%](https://caes.ucdavis.edu/news/feeding-cattle-seaweed-reduces-their-greenhouse-gas-emissions-82-percent)",

Seaweed is incredibly efficient at consuming carbon and turning it into oxygen (through photosynthesis), encourages a healthy underwater ecosystem, and doesn't take up valuable land space. Only downside is it allows for the continuance of livestock farming, unless we as a society (mostly western diets) cut out the middle \"man\" and embrace eating kelp ourselves\n\nEdit: lots of discussion below on what I meant by the last sentence. While I personally am vegetarian and extremely sympathetic to the vegan cause, I was mostly referring to how inefficient livestock farming is, mainly large-scale operations. As many of you have pointed out below, livestock take up valuable land area that could be used to produce food for direct human consumption and are huge sources for greenhouse emissions, from both animal and industry sources. Another factor often overlooked is that roaming herds are better for the underlying earth and soil. Herds accelerate carbon sequestration into the soil basically by stamping carbon into the ground, and animal waste contains important microbes for healthy soils. For these reasons, while I personally believe eating animals is wrong, I am fine with locally sourced, free range farms that treat their animals and the environment with dignity and respect. It is the large operations that are doing most of the damage",

All that gets eaten by the cow gets turned right back into CO2 or methane. Animal feed isn't an area where we get to improve carbon neutrality, lowering ourselves on the trophic level (by eating kelp ourselves, like you mention) is.  \n\n\nBut yes, it not taking up land space and the better 'emission portfolio' are good selling points.",

First off, I think it\u2019s important to establish that the *cow* is not making the methane, microbes inside the cow\u2019s gut make methane as a byproduct of their energy metabolism. Essentially, these microbes do chemistry to generate ATP for cellular processes, and one of the waste products of this chemistry is methane. \n\nNow that we\u2019ve established that, let\u2019s talk about seaweed. When we feed seaweed to the cow, it\u2019s broken down in the gut, the same place where the methanogens live. In the process of any food that the cow eats being digested, small one carbon molecules are produced, which the methanogens will try to feed into their energy making pathway. The thing is, seaweed has a lot of molecules in it that have heavier atoms, like bromine and chlorine, attached. So when the seaweed gets broken down in the cow gut, it turns into small one carbon molecules that still have these heavy atoms attached. The methanogens try to take up these molecules and put them into their methanogenesis pathway, but the heavy atoms attached jam up MCR, one of the main enzymes in this pathway. This results in less methane output. \n\n\nSo, to go back to the premise above, while the seaweed is eaten and broken down, it does result in less methane output in this case. The goal of the seaweed here is not carbon storage, but to be a feedstock additive that inhibits MCR and results in less methane output. Even if all those carbons were to turn into CO2 instead, methane has far greater warming potential than CO2, so that would still be a preferable outcome.\n\n\nI\u2019m on mobile and will add references later.",

The point of sea weed addition (in regards to climate impact) is to shift the carbon being taken in that would end up as methane (before breaking down to CO2 in atmosphere a long time later) to more directly be released from the cow as CO2. Methane is considered to have harsher short term climate impacts than CO2.\n\nWhile technically in the class of antibiotics, the ionophore rumensin in feed also has a similar effect (reduction in methane output) and my perception is that it's deployed at a much greater scale than seaweed currently is. My understanding is that rumensin in feed does not share the majority of the risks that using antibiotics used for humans has. Rumensin also increases feed efficiency, which is the amount of bodyweight a cow or steer adds for a given amount of feed. This would also  make the cow more carbon efficient because the end goal (raise a pound of meat for people to eat) is accomplished with less inputs (corn, soy, alfalfa) that require fossil fuel energy to create. \n\nCow breeds since pretty much the start of agriculture have been selectively bred for feed efficiency and will continue to be. Always a tradeoff between other breeding traits like docility, disease resistance, or time to market though.",

It grows and consumes more and more co2 and puts out oxygen. Great. Then when the tree is big you decide that's enough, well done tree. Now let's use you for fuel. \n\nEvery single bit of CO2 absorbed by the tree went into two things. One was creating energy for the tree to use, this immediately recreates all the co2 used for that process. This is why plants in darkness produce more CO2 than they use (which is none). The tree uses some of this to grow. They're mostly made out of carbon. \n\nThe moment you burn the tree, every single last piece of oxygen created and co2 captured gets reversed and put back into the air leaving you back where you started before you planted the tree.\n\nThis is why tree planting campaigns are kinda bogus. \n\nAnyway, it's a similar thing for plants. Growing plants as animal feed has no positive effect as the plants get consumed (like the tree getting burned). Except the animals that eat those plants convert some of the carbon into methane which is way worse than CO2 on a atom to atom scale.\n\nThe only solution to reverse CO2 levels is to somehow capture the carbon and bury it to give you more space to capture more. Which leads to the creation of coal and oil. Which we should really really really keep in the ground.",

In the burning the tree for fuel example, if you were otherwise going to burn coal to generate electricity and instead burned woody biomass to generate electricity, and didn't increase overall electrical demand production/consumption, that extra bit of coal would be kept in the ground. \n\nThe tree burning would be essentially carbon neutral, or slightly positive (meaning bad) due to inefficiencies of energy to grow/collect/process it.\n\nBecause the default it displaced  was burning coal is extremely carbon positive (bad), the net impact is slightly carbon negative (good). Burning biomass still has huge issues including deforestation and particulate pollution but the carbon math can be favorable. If you were generating electricity in a hydroelectric dam and shut that down to use a woody biomass project then yes that would be carbon positive (bad).\n\nI agree that these wouldn't lower current atmospheric concentrations of CO2, but as reality stands today, CO2 levels are continuing to increase. So anything that increases less quickly is still a net benefit over things that increase more quickly.\n\nThe goal with respect to ruminant livestock and climate impact however is to make sure they produce CO2 in favor of methane.\n\nIn the burning the tree for fuel example the analogy would be if you chucked that tree into a gasifier, creating CO and H2, and heating over a nickel catalyst to produce methane. That is an industrial process that produces substitute natural gas/synthetic natural gas. If you then burned that SNG in stoves and furnaces that people were going to use anyway (not increasing demand), it would turn into just as much CO2 as if the tree composted down (on a long enough timeline), so still net negative. However if they vented that methane into the atmosphere just for funsies that would be analogous to what the cow does. If instead the cow produced CO2 directly that would have less global warming potential than releasing methane and waiting for decades for it to degrade into CO2.\n\nLastly while collecting the methane (or CO2) they burp/breathe out would be logistically incredibly difficult, a decent portion of the methane emitted is due to manure management practices. Many large dairies store manure in large lagoons. They have relatively low oxygen levels which means the manure breaks down under anaerobic conditions, which produces more methane than CO2 (this is called biogas). This biogas can be collected, processed and input into either the natural gas pipeline system or burned in generators on site to produce electricity. Both of these would displace fossil fuels keeping those in the ground (carbon negative). The alternative would be to spread the manure over a very large area so it breaks down into CO2 directly. This probably requires smaller more distributed livestock which may or may not be feasible at scale. You would also need a commensurate amount of wind/solar/nuclear to make up for the electricity/fossil fuels that we're displaced in the biogas alternative.",

This is a point of huge disconnect with the general public and what actually happens in farming. About [86% of what livestock eat](https://www.fao.org/3/cc3134en/cc3134en.pdf) does not compete with human use in large part because of two things: 1. grazing 2. crop residue\n\n1. Take the US for example. Most of what cattle eat is on grassland not suitable for crop production or very prone to runoff, high inefficiency, etc., and we cannot eat grass directly. Grasslands are already an endangered ecosystem due to competition with crop acres, and they  need disturbances like grazing to survive. Here in the US, practically all beef cattle spend the majority of their life on pasutre, even those that eventually go to feedlots. Grazing that grass is eating at the lowest level we can of that part of the food chain. To follow up on your quote, it would be like saying you refuse to eat plants because they to \"eat\" food in the sense of nutrient requirements they get from soil. Instead we just eat at the lowest feasible trophic level for a particular system.\n\n2. Livestock are essentially recyclers. A huge portion of what they eat, even moreso for non-grazers, are crop residues we cannot use anymore. When crops are fed to livestock like corn and soybeans, human uses are already extracted and the remnants are used as feed. Few crops are \"single use\" involved in livestock feed, and those that are, like alfalfa, are used to break weed seed cycles and avoid overuse of herbicides in the crop rotation.\n\nThere's a lot going on in farming, but more often than not people massively gloss over what's going on and jump to very ungrounded conclusions.",

Because just the same way the 'evil lab' can pour cheap replacement vitamins into your synthmeat, an 'evil farm' can use granulate to stretch food, use illegal steroids to boost muscle growth for more high-value meat, or (even unknowingly) use contaminated ground water carrying heavy metals.\n\nThinking that open farming is magically immune to the same problems you're accusing labs off, is just wishful thinking based upon nostalgia. You're *used* to meat from open farms. therefore you're biased to attributing it with trust and qualities beyond objective reason.\n\n**Any** industry requires accountability in order to avoid it profiteering at the expense of the customer.

                    "comment": "&gt; No. Methane is a pretty much universal product of biology and digestion.\n\nThis is incorrect, [\"preliminary studies show that genetic variation in CH4 emissions is present in Angus cattle\"](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0472/13/3/602). It is implausible that all existing breeds of cattle produce the same amount of methane - even if only because different breeds will encourage different microorganisms to thrive and this will affect their methane emissions. The problem is testing lots of cattle for methane emissions - to pick the ones to breed from those with low emissions - requires significant funding, and nobody has paid for it. But it seems likely the payback in CO2e reduction would be extremely large compared to the cost of doing this work. \n\nFrom the same paper as linked above, \n\n\"One of the most difficult challenges in selecting animals with low CH4 production is measuring the CH4 in a large group of animals. Even commercial farms have difficulty performing these measurements. A genetic selection program necessitates thousands of measurements, which should be taken on a weekly basis. Selection is also difficult because grazing systems differ depending on climate, plant species, soil types, and livestock and include season-long continuous grazing, rest-rotation grazing, deferred rotational grazing, and intensively managed grazing. It appears that animal selection is required to develop biomarkers that can reliably estimate CH4 production on all types of farms.\"",

Slower growth cattle that require twice as many to produce the same amount of food? People have a poor success rate using biology to solve local problems (that island with one imported animal to take care of a problem, then another imported animal brought in to take care of the out of control expanding first imported animal population, then another animal, ...).\n\nCheck out Landfill Methane. ... Even how much suburban homeowners are mowing and bagging grass clippings or leaves going to the landfill (some is composted but still .. methane). Or how many chemicals (and water) are dumped on lawns to keep them green, to cut more, to landfill/compost more? Methane from bogs and rain forests? Need to drain wetlands?\n\nIt's going to be a really complicated problem to solve.\n\nAnd is Methane the big problem that needs solving? Who is benefiting and who is being injured in this fight against the cattle? Check out this pile of Bison Skulls, one group thought it was tactical to cull all the bison to keep food from another group and severely weaken their resistance. ( https://www.oursafetynet.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Buffalo-Skulls-700x600.png ) Those were a lot of methane producing bison piled up.",

Shes currently approaching twenty and has a job in tech security. The biggest factors were a lot more care and focus and the constant patience to keep doing enough patience, but another thing was to keep her brain constantly functioning, like moving/massaging her legs and fingers as an infant and young child. Personally, I think that Hawking did something similar by constantly keeping his brain active instead of turning into a bored slump and eventual husk of a man. I have no idea if keeping the brain busy could be a factor, but it does seem to be a common thing I see for people who shouldn't be alive or are very, very old. ",

Leonard Susskind disagreed with Hawking's position, but was unable to demonstrate it mathematically.  \n  \nIt would take him ten years to do so, involving him with many other physicists and leading to several startling discoveries about the nature of black holes, time and space, leading to the holographic principle. Ten years of furious, brilliant research by multiple luminaries in the field, all touched off by a single, insightful question by Professor Hawking.  \n  \nSusskind's book is quite accessible and well worth a read. Readers will get to see how physics is done, at least at the social and professional level. Plus, for a while and through Susskind, one gets to hang around a quiet social gathering of some of the most brilliant physicists the world has seen.",

To my understanding, Hawking proposed a lot of theories (both accepted and refuted) that have opened a lot of questions with cosmology and quantum mechanics. He did a lot of 'probing' per say, which inspired a lot of research and further investigation. Additionally (and more famously), he was a HUGE figure in black hole theory, and is comparable to the Issac Newton or James Clerk Maxwell of black holes.\n\nOverall Hawking has been a gift to this world and we should be eternally grateful for his contributions. I don't like to jus go out and say \"X was the best/most influential physicist\" because the quantity and complexity of questions answered fluctuates wildly across the greats, but I would consider Hawking to within the top 50 or 40 physicists in all of history. A more accurate and better description is: he is one of the most, if not the most influential physicist following the modern era. For sure, though, he is a titan in the field of astrophysics and cosmology.",

His primary contributions were in the area of black hole mechanics, including the singularity theorems and Hawking radiation. He also did a great deal of interesting  theoretical work in cosmology, but we don't currently have any way of telling whether the models he proposed are correct.\n\nWith that said, I don't think we can call Stephen Hawking one of the all-time greats like Einstein, Newton, or Maxwell, who revolutionized multiple unrelated fields of physics. His work was significantly more localized in subject matter and theoretical, and most of it has not been empirically confirmed (although his black hole research is almost certain to be correct).\n\nOf course, his contributions as an explainer of science to the public and as an ambassador for scientists as a group should not be neglected. But they do give some people the impression that he was even greater than he actually was as a physicist.",

This is the problem with these kinds of discussions - in people's top 10 most influential physicists of all time, 'greatest minds', surely about half of them would have been working in the region 1900-1950. We didn't have a bumper harvest of great minds, there are a whole range of environmental and circumstantial factors at play.\n\nSame goes with the fact that much of Hawking's work is not empirically verified. If two people each have an idea, and we have the technological capacity to test one and not the other, that doesn't mean the second idea is any weaker in terms of depth of intellectual thought or originality. That's just another arbitrary circumstance.\n\nSo while yes you are right, he doesn't have the sheer weight of impact across many fields that people like Maxwell and Einstein did, but I don't think that should necessarily diminish his right to be compared to those people as an original thinker. Science has changed since those days and if we only think in those terms we will never have another 'great' again.",

                    "comment": "I'll start with some of his accomplishments: He was one of the first people to propose primordial black holes along with Carr, Zel'dovich and Novikov, which if observed could give us a window into the early universe, and may even be dark matter. Perhaps his most well-known work is the proposition that black holes radiate as black bodies (ie Hawking radiation), generalizing the work of Unruh. This has led to the creation of the lively subfield of black hole thermodynamics and information theory. He is also one of the founders of quantum cosmology (the idea that you can have a wave function representation of expanding spacetime) along with Hartle, Wheeler and DeWitt.\n\nAs for how he compares against the greats... this is not to belittle his accomplishments in any way, of which there were obviously many, but none of his predictions have ever been experimentally verified. A lot of people here are comparing Hawking to the likes of Einstein, but honestly, from a working physicist who is familiar with his work, he doesn't even come close. Einstein's ideas represented a fundamental shift in our understanding of the universe, and have been verified over and over again. There are many others who have fundamentally altered our view of the universe (and have been vindicated by experiment) that many laymen have probably never heard of before (Maxwell, Dirac, de Broglie, Bohr, Heisenberg, Friedman/Robertson/Walker, Weinberg/Salam, Yang/Mills, Noether, Gell-Mann, and these are just some prominent theorists of the last century, there are many more great minds behind every groundbreaking experiment, like Wu, Hubble, Ruben, Weiss, Rutherford, Thompson, etc). Until his ideas are verified, they're just untested hypotheses (though nobody in the field seriously doubts Hawking radiation isn't real). Hawking's contributions, while very interesting in their own right, are not the ground-breaking game-changers that revolutionized physics.\n\nThat said, I'd say he's probably one of the most influential scientists of the century, not only because of his interesting work, but also because the man is an example of perseverance in the face of overwhelming odds. Not only did he manage to survive, but he pushed the boundaries of human knowledge. That's something we can all aspire to.",

From the viewpoint of positivist philosophy, however, one cannot determine what is real. All one can do is find which mathematical models describe the universe we live in. It turns out that a mathematical model involving imaginary time predicts not only effects we have already observed but also effects we have not been able to measure yet nevertheless believe in for other reasons. So what is real and what is imaginary?

I ripped out the mechanism of our old wind-up gramophone and put in a turntable and a three-valve amplifier. I made a speaker cabinet from an old book case, with a sheet of chip-board on the front. The whole system looked pretty crude, but it didn\u2019t sound too bad. At the time LPs were very expensive so I couldn\u2019t afford any of them on a schoolboy budget. But I bought Stravinsky\u2019s Symphony Of Psalms because it was on sale as a 10\u201d LP, which were being phased out. The record was rather scratched, but I fell in love with the third movement, which makes up more than half the symphony.\u201d\n\n\n[Wieniawski\u2019s Violin Concerto No. 1](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aNOdaBJbT8A)Professor Hawking was actually inspired to buy a collection of Wieniawski\u2019s music after hearing his second concerto on Radio 3 in the 1990s, but prefers the first in particular for its \u201chaunting phrase in the first movement\u201d.\n\n\n[Francis Poulenc\u2019s Gloria](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ReqsEqKtyyA) is the final piece in Professor Hawking\u2019s musical trilogy. Part of the work caused a \u201cscandal\u201d \u2013 in the French composer\u2019s own words \u2013 when it was first performed in 1959 because of its unusual mixture of light-heartedness and spirituality. Poulenc later explained that he had been thinking of frescoes in which angels stick out their tongues and \u201cserious Benedictines whom I saw playing soccer one day\u201d when he wrote it.\nProfessor Hawking first heard the Poulenc Gloria in Aspen, Colorado, during the resort\u2019s 1995 music festival. \u201cYou can sit in your office in the physics centre there and hear the music without ever buying a ticket,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on this occasion I was actually in the tent to hear the Gloria. It is one of a small number of works I consider great music.\u201d\n",

What I loved most\u2014every word he used, every perfect thought and idea, so thoughtful and considerate of the human race. He was a true humanitarian, and it was important for me to see someone model such a visceral belief in the worth of human nature. I feel that right now.

His insight was basically that in quantum field theory, the flux across a surface in vacuum depends on the space-time curvature. He showed that the taken-for-granted result that an empty vacuum stays that way doesn't always hold. The distribution of produced particles or radiation is thermal, which is a minor miracle.\n\n&gt;What sort of particles is it?\n\nAll of them. While the details change, Hawking's argument doesn't care what kind of particle we're talking about, if it obeys QFT, it will be emitted. However the caveat is that if the mass M &gt; kT, (Boltzmann's constant times temperature) then those particles don't participate much in emission. Once the black hole gets small enough and therefore hot enough, you can expect it to emit massive particles like electrons and positrons too at large rates too.",

Thermal distributions come about from quantum systems that have many degrees of freedom and can emit energy in many ways, but because the emission is quantized aka photons, the statistics of what emissions are most likely is restricted.\n\nThis is wholly unlike a black hole which is... well... a vacuum that happens to have a funky geometry. A black hole isn't like a bunch of iron atoms being heated on your electric stove, because a black hole doesn't have many microscopic quantum parts... or at least we can't describe black holes as having many microscopic quantum parts in general relativity. \n\nMy view is that this is because of some unclarified relationship between geometry, and thermodynamics we've just uncovered a small part of. That you can \"derive\" the Hawking temperature entirely by geometrical arguments ignoring what Hawking initially did, but later realized, is a red flag for me. The highlights of that connection is this,\n\n* quantum field theories at finite temperature have this funky property of being \"periodic in imaginary time.\" This happens because the time evolution in quantum mechanics (how stuff changes in time, duh!) and the partition function Z (how likely is your system to be in a certain state/configuration at some temperature) are basically the same math. \n\nSo here's the game--find the periodicity, you get the temperature.\n\n* If I look at a black hole, but consider imaginary time, you immediately in like 2 lines of algebra get a periodicity related to the mass of the black hole. And bingo. We found the periodicity of a black hole, and therefore we know its temperature.\n\nIt's basically black magic.",

You want the physicist to talk to your grieving family about the conservation of energy, so they will understand that your energy has not died.

You want your mother to know that all your energy, every vibration, every Btu of heat, every wave of every particle that was her beloved child remains with her in this world. You want the physicist to tell your weeping father that amid energies of the cosmos, you gave as good as you got.\n\nAnd at one point you'd hope that the physicist would step down from the pulpit and walk to your brokenhearted spouse there in the pew and tell him that all the photons that ever bounced off your face, all the particles whose paths were interrupted by your smile, by the touch of your hair, hundreds of trillions of particles, have raced off like children, their ways forever changed by you. And as your widow rocks in the arms of a loving family, may the physicist let her know that all the photons that bounced from you were gathered in the particle detectors that are her eyes, that those photons created within her constellations of electromagnetically charged neurons whose energy will go on forever.\n\nAnd the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat. There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it. And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here, still part of all that we are, even as we who mourn continue the heat of our own lives.\n\nAnd you'll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy's still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you're just less orderly. \n\nCommentator : Aaron Freeman for NPR",

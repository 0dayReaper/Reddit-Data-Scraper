            "comment": "According to this article, ANY therapy that causes rapid onset glycemic control is associated with a higher *short term* risk of retinopathy, while also being associated with a *lower* long-term risk, and the exact mechanism is not really understood yet. So it\u2019s not specific to GLP-1 agonists (although they haven\u2019t yet ruled out that they do specifically cause problems somehow), insulin pumps etc also show this association.\n\n[HbA1c Change and Diabetic Retinopathy During GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Cardiovascular Outcome Trials: A Meta-analysis and Meta-regression (Diabetes Care, 2021) ](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/44/1/290/33249/HbA1c-Change-and-Diabetic-Retinopathy-During-GLP-1)\n\n&gt;\tIn conclusion, our data suggest that the strongest relationship between GLP-1RA treatment and early worsening of retinopathy after drug initiation is via their impact on HbA1c; however, without dedicated trials designed to evaluate the impact on retinopathy, a direct mechanism attributable to one or more drugs in this class cannot be excluded. In this respect, care for those initiating GLP-1RA treatment should not differ from care provided for patients initiating any type of intensive glucose-lowering therapy. Early detection and treatment of retinopathy remains the standard of care. Screening for retinopathy in patients with type 2 diabetes is recommended from the time of diagnosis and typically annually thereafter, depending on the level of glycemic control and retinopathy status (28). Those with severe, proliferative retinopathy should undergo treatment for retinopathy before or in conjunction with the initiation of intensive glucose-lowering therapy. Progression of diabetic retinopathy due to intensified glycemic control is typically transient and reversible over a longer period of time (29). Even with the potential for initial progression of retinopathy, intensive glycemic treatment reduces risk for the onset and progression of diabetic retinopathy over time compared with conventional treatment (29). Current recommendations that GLP-1RAs be used early in the treatment of type 2 diabetes acknowledge their effective glucose-lowering effects and associated potential for weight loss and low risk of hypoglycemia. As with any potent glucose-lowering agent, clinicians should consider retinopathy status at the time of treatment initiation and follow guidelines for monitoring in patients with established retinopathy.\n\nInteresting! I don\u2019t actually know anything else about this, my medical knowledge is all for different species and we don\u2019t (yet!) even use those drugs in vet med, but as a person with crappy retinas I was curious and went searching and thought you might be interested in what I found.",

            "comment": "The gigantic sauropod dinosaurs were pre-adapted to gigantism - that is, even before they evolved gigantic size they had a number of characteristics that made them suitable for being huge.  And as they evolved toward gigantism, they picked up some other adaptations that let them move further along that path. \n\nMost of what I\u2019m going to say comes from \n\n* [Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: the evolution of gigantism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3045712/)\n* [An Evolutionary Cascade Model for Sauropod Dinosaur Gigantism - Overview, Update and Tests](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3812984/)\n* [Rapid growth preceded gigantism in sauropodomorph evolution](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822\\(22\\)01308-2)\n\nThe first two references are open access and if you\u2019re interested you should read the whole things. The first in particular sums up a lot of work. It offers five main factors: \n\n&gt;\t1. Reduction in body density \n&gt;\t2. Reduced cost of locomotion \n&gt;\t3. Reduced cost of respiration\n&gt;\t4. Lower basal metabolic rate and gigantothermy\n&gt;\t5. Reduced cost of reproduction\n\nI won\u2019t go into each of them, since the article is free to read. But it\u2019s worth emphasizing that dinosaurs, as opposed to mammals, have a much better respiration system than ours. That includes both a more efficient airflow, and (very significantly) pneumaticized bones. That is, dinosaurs, including modern birds, include air pockets in many of their bones, which makes them much lighter for their size than mammals with their thick, solid bones. \n\n&gt;\tThe extensive air sac system of sauropods with diverticula invading most of the presacral vertebral column and the ribs resulted in a specific body density of 0.8 kg L\u22121, with certain parts such as the neck having a value of 0.6 kg L\u22121 only (Henderson, 2004; Wedel, 2005; Schwarz &amp; Fritsch, 2006). This is also expressed as a body mass reduction by 8\u201310% in volume-based estimates (Wedel, 2005). The hypothesis that the light-weight construction of the axial skeleton of sauropods contributed to their gigantism thus is supported. \n\n\u2014 [Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: the evolution of gigantism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3045712/)\n\nBetter airflow makes a more efficient animal:\n\n&gt;\tSince the work of breathing and its energetic cost is directly proportional to breathing frequency and inversely proportional to the compliance of the respiratory system, an avian-like lung-air-sac system in a sauropod would be extremely energy-efficient to operate. The result in the case of a bradymetabolic homoiothermic giant sauropod would be an extremely low energetic cost of breathing per unit time compared with extant mammals and birds (Perry et al., 2009).\n\n\u2014 [Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: the evolution of gigantism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3045712/)\n\nSince there will certainly be many people confidently proclaiming that high oxygen environments had something to do with dinosaur gigantism I\u2019ll point out that that\u2019s not only false, but backwards - dinosaurs evolved during a relatively low-oxygen period; but that\u2019s probably not a major factor either way for gigantism. \n\n&gt;\tThe Late Triassic was the time of the lowest atmospheric oxygen levels of the entire Phanerozoic, and the ability of taking up twice as much oxygen than other tetrapods would have been of great selective advantage. This hypothesis is in accordance with several observations, e.g. both sauropods and theropods increased in body size very rapidly compared to ornithischian dinosaurs, and saurischian dinosaurs dominated the Jurassic faunas. \u2026 This review rejects a number hypotheses about sauropod gigantism: there is no evidence for a higher atmospheric oxygen level during the Mesozoic than today. A higher level is not necessary for the sauropod body plan to function \n\n\u2014 [Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: the evolution of gigantism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3045712/)\n\nAs well as these built-in factors pre-adapting dinosaurs to gigantism, sauropods in particular evolved a series of adaptations letting them move further along the giant pathway. These include long necks, allowing more efficient feeding:\n\n&gt;\tProbably the most conspicuous features of the sauropod bauplan, the very long neck, was the first key innovation in the evolution of gigantism. \u2026The long neck allowed exploitation of food inaccessible to smaller herbivores and a much larger feeding envelope than in a short-necked animal and thus significantly decreased the energetic cost of feeding (Stevens &amp; Parrish, 1999; Preuschoft et al., in press; Seymour, 2009a).\n\n\u2014 [Biology of the sauropod dinosaurs: the evolution of gigantism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3045712/)\n\nThe long neck was possible because of pre-adaption, and it was supported by some innovative structures strengthening and supporting the neck:\n\n&gt;\tSeveral anatomical features enabled this extreme elongation, including: absolutely large body size and quadrupedal stance providing a stable platform for a long neck; a small, light head that did not orally process food; cervical vertebrae that were both numerous and individually elongate; an efficient air-sac-based respiratory system; and distinctive cervical architecture. Relevant features of sauropod cervical vertebrae include: pneumatic chambers that enabled the bone to be positioned in a mechanically efficient way within the envelope; and muscular attachments of varying importance to the neural spines, epipophyses and cervical ribs. \n\n\u2014[Why sauropods had long necks; and why giraffes have short necks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3628838/)\n\nWhy did gigantism evolve? In general, it\u2019s good to be big. The bigger you are, the harder it is to eat you, and you can take advantage of economies of scale - one 50-ton animal needs less food than ten 5-ton animals, for example. For most species, getting bigger hits barriers fairly quickly. Dinosaurs started off with a set of characteristics that permitted gigantism, and sauropods in particular further evolved support for it over time, so they were able to get bigger.",

Because of this huge gamechanger, plants that utilized it spread quickly and became common. it was believed bogs and swamps were also common in this time period, ecosystems with often acidic and hypoxic conditions. As a result it was easy for large amounts of fallen wood and peat to collect and eventually be buried underground in oxygen poor environments, which further prevented decomposition. after that, pressure over millions of years created our various types of coal.\n\nnowadays we have numerous fungi, bacteria, and even larger organisms specialized to chew through wood, living or dead, so its much harder for wood and peat to be buried and eventually turn into coal. The destruction of forests, bogs, and swamps for use by humans also obviously limits nature's ability to produce more coal as well since the best spots for doing so are being converted into parking lots and farmland",

At a bit over 25% oxygen, even wet biological material starts to burn. \n\nIt wasn't until late in that period that organisms developed that could digest wood.

And even then, an I-beam is weaker (albeit only slightly) than an equivalent bar of steel that is filled in.  The I-beam is also much easier to damage as you can chip off a portion of it or bend a portion of it much more easily than if it were a solid bar.\n\nBones with hollowed out pockets are more fragile than solid bone (all other characteristics of the bones being equal).  That increased fragility may be minimal, or they may be strong enough to start that it doesn't matter, but they absolutely are (at least somewhat) weaker and less able to handle damage (which is a separate but important distinction when discussing fragility).",

A hollow shaft has much higher strength per unit weight than a solid shaft in both bending AND torsion (which is where I-beams really suffer - I-beams are optimised for bending and cannot withstand big twisting/torsional loads). And in compression and tension, a hollow shaft and a solid shaft have equal strength per unit weight. The hollow shaft would just bigger (larger diameter) than the same-weight solid shaft because obviously the center is hollow and the extra material to make up lost mass has to be added to the outside.\n\nThis is why in many engineering applications they try and use hollow parts when possible. For example automotive roll cages are hollow round-section steel. Metal chairs use hollow pipes. The only time you'll find solid metal is when the metal is already very thin (like car bodies or paperclips), or when external diameter needs to be kept small (like rebar).",

You wouldn't want to build a suspension bridge or skyscraper out of solid beams even if cost was not an issue. \n\n*begin armchair speculation*\n\nSo in the same way once you get to a certain size of animal, solid bones get too heavy to carry their own weight. Probably around the size of a mastedon. \n\nHollow bones however being lighter allow for the animal to get much bigger. The advantage of size might outweigh the disadvantage of bones that are slightly more fragile to impact. \n\n*end armchair speculation*\n\nIn human (and I assume all mammal) bones, all of the strength is in the hard, outer, cortical layer. The cancellous inner bone barely adds any strength.

The difference between that question and grandma-with-wheels is we know there were adaptive radiations of both grandma and a different grandma that did have wheels so comparing anatomy of the grandmas can certainly provide insight into evolution and ecology of grandmas and more generally, and clues from their evolution and ecology can tell us what wheels might make possible that we didn't realise, in this case, for example, whether hollow bones can support a gigantic animal that isn't aquatic:\n\n&gt;It was believed throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries that sauropods like Brachiosaurus were too massive to support their own weight on dry land, and instead lived partly submerged in water.[79] Riggs, affirming observations by John Bell Hatcher, was the first to defend in length that most sauropods were fully terrestrial animals in his 1904 account on Brachiosaurus, pointing out that their hollow vertebrae have no analogue in living aquatic or semiaquatic animals, and their long limbs and compact feet indicate specialization for terrestrial locomotion. Brachiosaurus would have been better adapted than other sauropods to a fully terrestrial lifestyle through its slender limbs, high chest, wide hips, high ilia and short tail. In its dorsal vertebrae the zygapophyses were very reduced while the hyposphene-hypantrum complex was extremely developed, resulting in a stiff torso incapable of bending sideways. The body was fit for only quadrupedal movement on land.[12] Though Riggs's ideas were gradually forgotten during the first half of the twentieth century, the notion of sauropods as terrestrial animals has gained support since the 1950s, and is now universally accepted among paleontologists.[80][79] In 1990 the paleontologist Stephen Czerkas stated that Brachiosaurus could have entered water occasionally to cool off (thermoregulate).[81]",

Gas exchange happens both during inhalation and exhalation. When a bird inhales, air gets pushed over gas-exchanging structures. When a bird exhales, air again gets pushed over gas-exchanging structures. \n\nMammals only get one air-exchange per breath. We inhale, exchange gas, exhale. \n\n2. No dead space. When mammals exhale, (oxygen-poor) air remains in the lungs. On inhale, fresh air gets mixed in with the old, lowering the available oxygen. \n\nIn birds, dead space is minimal, so the maximum amount of oxygen reaches the lungs and gets exchanged with the blood.",

Then you have to exhale that used air out the same way that it came in. \nBirds have a totally different system where the lungs stay static and they have separate sets of air sacs on either end of the lungs, and [on both the inhale *and* the exhale, new air flows through the lungs.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/BirdRespiration.svg/1280px-BirdRespiration.svg.png)\n\nAlso instead of folds in the lungs they absorb oxygen through branching small tubes. For birds, all this air sac apparatus takes up twice as much body volume as mammal lungs do, but that also isn't really a downside if being lightweight is an advantage. Here is the wikipedia section on bird respiration: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_anatomy#Respiratory_system\n\nEdit: welp, while I was typing this two other people typed the same thing.",

I favor the random chance role of life as my favorite \"why\" answer: that life gets lots of adaptations, randomly, that often do not do anything, but sometimes turn out to be very good for some particular thing (like being able to grow big without breaking your own skeleton from the huge weight).  \n\nThe life form has to have that adaptation before it can take advantage of it.  I don't think the Lamarckian idea of \"we could use it so lets make it happen\" argument has much factual support. \n\nRandom chance isn't much of an answer for \"why\" either. Basically says there is no actual why.  It says, if it can happen, it will.  Just only once in a while.  An awful lot of the way our universe exists revolves around that \"randomness\" idea though.",

You don't get from an early, dog-sized dinosaur to a sauropod in one go; there were a lot of intermediary steps, all of which had to be advantageous on their own, so there was some consistent set of circumstances favoring larger size over that whole process rather than any number of other random mutations that must have occurred. The idea of \"pre-adaptation\" is that the organism's existing set of traits (all acquired for their own reasons, by some combination of chance and previous natural selection) mean that certain future adaptations will either be easier or gel well with the existing traits, making them more likely to be favored in the long term.",

            "comment": "People have given many good reasons but there are two simpler ones that beg a mention, too:\n\nFirst, looking only at modern fauna is incomplete, because we are in the middle of a mass extinction event that began after 100,000 years ago. If you were to time travel to just 20,000 years ago, the largest terrestrial animal on Earth wouldn't be the African elephant, which tops at 4 meters in height, but the Asian straight-tusked elephant Palaeoloxodon namadicus, which topped at 5 meters. P. antiquus was the largest terrestrial mammal of all time, as tall as the largest ornitopod dinosaur Shantungosaurus, and taller than all carnivorous dinosaurs including Tyrannosaurus, Giganotosaurus, and Spinosaurus. It was even taller (shoulder wise) than Diplodocus and almost average for Apatosaurus. \n\nSo while on average dinosaur species are much larger than mammals, the largest mammal ever is actually only surpassed by the most gigantic sauropods, which are a relative small number of dinosaur species overall.\n\nThe other factor is a prolonged time in stable climatic conditions. In general the Cenozoic has not been as long and stable as the Mesozoic (yet).\n\nThe K/T extinction 66 million years ago killed all animals larger than a dog (and many smaller than one). In spite of this, it only took mammals 30 million years to produce Paraceratherium, an animal almost as large as Palaeoloxodon already. If the world had not become drier and colder and Paraceratherium become extinct with no descendants, who is to say it wouldn't have evolved into an even larger animal?\n\nNow I don't know when the first giant sauropod evolved, but the classic Morrison Formation fauna (Brachiosaurus, Apatosaurus, Diplodocus) lived about 150 million years ago. Dinosaurs first appeared about 240 million years ago. Which means, there were potentially 90 million years before dinosaurs reached those sizes compared to just the 30 or 60 mammals have had.",

And regarding the time comparison, sauropods like Lessemsaurus were indeed reaching into the 10 ton range by the end of the Triassic, and it's perhaps worth noting that there was a major extinction event at the end of the triassic ~200 mya, so it wasn't exactly stable all the way through.\n\nYou have a bit of a point regarding the relative timescale but this is an odd way to argue it.",

Maybe not quite as large as the largest dinosaurs but we had giant sloths, giant bears, wolfs, cats and even got raptors back for a while with terror birds. Then humans showed up. There is a lot of debate on if humans are the cause of extinction of many of the large animals but there is a very strong correlation in when humans showed up and when large animals began disappearing from the fossil record. Humans in general do not like giant scary things and giant scary things also feed a group of people for a very long time, those two things don't go well together for the big scary thing. Like the bears were some 20 feet tall and got most of its food by smelling out kills something else made them showing up and being like \"this is mine now\" and animals would just run off letting the bear have it. When the bears walked up on people, they just got more food.",

You mention bears, there was no 20 foot tall bear. The largest fossil bear, *Arcotherium*, could have stood 14 feet tall when standing upright, and may have weighed just shy of 2 tons. This is a big animal, but an 8 ton 40 foot long *Tyrannosaurus* would view it as food. *T. rex* is thought to have been on par in terms of mass with the very largest African elephants ever known, and it shared its environment with prey animals that were significantly larger.\n\nThe largest terrestrial mammal discovered was a relative of the rhinos, *Paraceratherium*. That animal evolved and went extinct tens of millions of years before humans arrived. It was about as large as some of the largest Hadrosaurs, such as *Shantungosaurus*, at around 15 tons.

This was about dinosaurs in general not specifically sauropods I thought though? So the general idea of \"why did dinosaurs have so many while mammals don't?\" Is that mammals did also, it's just a bunch of survivorship bias all coming together. Dinosaurs had a massive length of time to hit a couple real winners and in less time mammals went from basically mice to rival the dinosaurs would imply that mammals are just about as good at it. Admittedly dinosaurs would seem to have higher ceiling than mammals but how many times do we think \"nothing could do this\" then find out some animal breaks that rule?\n\nAlso, pretty sure the specific ones I listed are mostly thought to have become extinct suspiciously close to humans first arrival, so maybe the environment that caused them to become extinct gave way to let humans expand be it through environmental change or just the fact giant predators stopped tearing through us, which as I understand it is where the debate generally is.\n\n\nThen survivorship bias because larger things tend to be easier to find than smaller things and I don't actually know this for sure but I assume the fossilize easier due to just being larger. On the other hand the size may lead to them breaking more and thus actually making it less common, I will fully admit to making an educated assumption on that one with plenty of room to be wrong.",

By the end of the Triassic, there were already Dinosaurs approaching or possibly exceeding 4 tons in mass, while mammals didn\u2019t start getting larger than half a ton until the end of the Paleocene, about 160 million years after that. So Dinosaurs reached large sizes faster than mammals did, even if you only consider what mammals started doing after the end of the Cretaceous, even though that\u2019s ignoring the overwhelming majority of the evolutionary history of mammals.\n\nAnd again, the very largest land mammals only reached a quarter of the sizes that the largest Dinosaurs did, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to say they came close. However to be fair, the largest extremes of the rhino, sloth, and elephant lineages were able to compete with large Hadrosaurs, so they definitely did get very big.\n\nWhat I meant is just that humans have only been around for less than half a million years, so while we undoubtedly played a role in the extinction of certain ancient animal lineages, many of them died out before humanity even showed up.\n\nAlso, smaller animals are much more likely to fossilize than giant ones, because it is much easier for small animals to become buried by natural processes.",

We have a lot of smugness to us for a species thats biggest fear is stuff we make up and subject ourselves to. If a big animal began terrorizing humanity and we just had no recourse we would kill them.

Air sacs allow for animals to take it air while they\u2019re exhaling too. This led to more oxygenation, especially for animals like sauropods that had long necks that would have otherwise made it harder to breathe.\n\n3. Lighter bone densities. This may seem weird because you\u2019d think a bigger animal would need heavier bones. On the contrary, if the bones weigh less then it means less energy spent moving around\n\n4. Co-evolution arms race. A species is hunted by a big predator, increasing in size is a good way to defend against this. Once the herbivores get bigger, the predator must now get bigger. This cycle continues until you get giants.\n\n5. Sauropods we\u2019re also able to reach such large sizes because their long necks allowed them to reach higher and this had almost limitless food and zero competition. Most herbivores we\u2019re eating grass and bushes and low tree branches, but Nothing else was eating tree tops. A species with \u201climitless\u201d resources has nothing controlling it and can just keep going.\n\nAs for today, maybe. First of all the largest living animals today are blue whales. The African elephant is the largest land animal. This is pure opinion and speculation, but I\u2019d say the chances of any animal ever getting so impossibly huge in our era is unlikely. Climate change is heating the planet which will affect plant life and pollution is poisoning the oceans. We\u2019re in the midst of an extinction event. Historically speaking during extinctions the smaller organisms come out on top. They need less food. Sauropods and t-rexes were among the first to go extinct after the meteor.\n\nEdit 1: Co-evolution not convolution. Typo.\n\nEdit 2: this is blowing up and after having a discussion in a different comment I\u2019d like to correct and clarify my statement. Oxygen levels during the Cretaceous were higher which is when a lot of these land giants lived and thrived but many rose during Triassic or Jurassic when oxygen levels were lower. This would sort of nullify my #1 point but would absolutely put emphasis on #2. Other animals that didn\u2019t have air sacs would be limited while ones that did would have an advantage to oxygenate them more.",

Maybe during the Cretaceous, oxygen was higher than today. But the biggest dinosaur herbivores evolved mostly in the Jurassic. \n\n5. The earliest evidence we have for the existence of grasses is 66 million years ago. For basically all of the age of dinosaurs, grass hadn't evolved yet. Or at the very least, they weren't widespread enough to be found in the fossil record consistently before 66 million years ago.\n\nAlso, we don't know the exact order in which dinosaurs went extinct after the KT extinction event. Maybe they all died in a few weeks or months. Maybe some hung on for a few years after, but it's impossible to tell the exact timing. The kt boundary layer is just a jumble of tsunami debris (depending on location) / shocked quartz, iridium enriched minerals, fire residue, etc. It's just that dinosaur fossils are found below it and no dinosaur fossils are found above it.",

Bigger surface area + \"cold blood\" = efficient use of environmental conditions.\n\nOn top of that, higher carbon dioxide levels in the air resulting in more plants resulting in more food for herbivores and more oxygen (overall, thicker atmosphere). \n\nMore giant herbivores means predators have to grow larger to hunt them, and have more food when they do. Scavengers can remain small, but something has to actually kill the things.\n\nUnder present conditions (a late ice-age), we dont have an environment capable of supporting what we call megafauna- and instead incentivize smaller life to live. Small weighted averages add up over time in competition, and result in slow extinctions, as well as gradual miniaturization due to higher success rate of smaller variants of the same \"species\".\n\nKinda like how Great White Sharks are more or less tiny Megalodons.",

It clearly says that it was proposed theory, not set in stone fact. I am all about accepting new information and adjusting my understanding based on new information.

What did change was a HUGE % jump on free oxygen from like 15% to 19% around 250 MYA (were at 21% now) so yes they had had access to more oxygen but not more than present day",

What happens is that tentative but incorrect theories are rapidly replaced, but the idiots who write popular media don\u2019t know it and keep pushing crap for decades, and Dunning-Kruggerites on Reddit parrot the crap for even longer. \n\nFor example, the \u201ctheory\u201d that high oxygen levels were related to dinosaurs really lasted only a couple of years before it was overturned, and that was around 25 years ago.  But as this thread clearly shows, here we are 25 years later with people confidently pushing this briefly-held, long-overturned idea. \n\n* *Pushed in 1996*: Hengst RA, Rigby JK, Landis GP, Sloan RL.

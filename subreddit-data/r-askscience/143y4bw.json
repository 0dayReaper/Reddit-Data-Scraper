            "comment": "Both onions and garlic are species of the same genus, *Allium*. But this isn\u2019t quite the same as, say, *Homo neanderthalensis* and *Homo sapiens* both being members of the genus *Homo*\u2026*Allium* as a genus is [roughly 40 million years old](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7262478/), and contains more than 800 species. \n\nBut within *Allium* there are three separate major evolutionary lineages, and both garlic and onions belong to the third lineage, which split from the second lineage closer to 20 million years ago. And from figure 3B in the above-linked paper, we can see that the ancestor of modern garlic (*Allium sativum*) and the ancestor of the different modern onion species (the branch containing *Allium cepa*) separated roughly 9 million years ago. That\u2019s in the ballpark of when the hominini (humans and chimps) split from the ancestors of gorillas\u2026so garlic and onions are pretty closely related indeed!",

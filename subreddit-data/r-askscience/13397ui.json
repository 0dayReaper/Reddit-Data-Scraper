That tiny little flared nozzle not only makes it easy to meter the liquid but restricts the availability of volatile reactions.\n\nLeave it open and go on vacation ... yeah ... you've got 1/4 a bottle of alcohol now.",

Liquid alcohol may evaporate, not evaporate, or precipitate from vapors while in contact with air, other gas mix, or no other gas involved.\n\nIn a closed container, liquid alcohol will evaporate until partial pressure of its vapors reach value appropriate for ambient temperature, then stop.",

            "comment": "It's a liquid at STP. It's  concentration on the inside of the bottle is very high (at or near it's vapor pressure) so that as much is re-entering the liquid phase from the vapor phase as vice versa. \n\nIt's concentration on the outside of an open bottle is very low, so that it evaporates away. \n\nIf you happened to open a bottle of alcohol in a room filled with alcohol vapor at a concentration (partial pressure) near the vapor pressure, the level in the bottle would not change.",

            "comment": "It reaches the equilibrium point of evaporation within the bottle. You have a pretty small amount of air that can hold only a small amount of evaporated isopropyl alcohol, and once it has that amount the net rate of evaporation/condensation becomes zero. That amount is way less than the amount the air outside of the bottle could hold.",

            "comment": "All liquids have a vapour pressure, which is dependent on temperature and pressure of the system they are in. Once they exhibit that vapour pressure they will go into a dynamic equilibrium with the gas (headspace), vaporising and condensing at the same rate.\n\nIn a sealed bottle, therefore, the liquid level would remain constant as there is no gas entering or leaving the system to reduce the vapour pressure and force more evaporation. It's why once opened a bottle of liquid will eventually dry out over time as the seal is no longer completely airtight and gas exchange can occur.",

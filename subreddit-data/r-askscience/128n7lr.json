    "postText": "I have seen this animation on how the thousands of satellite revolved around the earth, and it led me to wonder about Saturn. Saturn has these rings, and how in the world does it look like that? I have also seen this j1407b who has lots of rings.\n\nSo, what causes the rings on planets, and how did they form? How do they have different layers, and how do they separate?\n\nThanks for any explanation.",

            "comment": "I don't know what exactly causes it or if there is an actual cause for it, but rings around planets emerge due to sattelites (moons) that are unable to form a planetary body (or more likely had one that was unable to sustain itself due to certain gravitational conditions and fell apart in many pieces) that is big enough to absorb al the rubble in it's orbit. Therefore the rubble spreads pretty much evenly through the orbit and is therefore percieved as a ring from far away (this hasn't just happened with sattelites it also happened with planets, which is why we have the planetoid belt in between Mars and Jupiter, this is the result of a planet that was unable to absorb all rubble in its orbit and therefore is a ring of smaller planetoids in the original orbit.",

    "postText": "Just sat and ate a hot sausage roll and then a cold one and noticed a difference in the way I perceived the taste, with the hot one being nicer.\n\nSo my question is, why does a hot meal taste better than the exact same cold one?  I mean a cold tin of beans tastes terrible compared to a warmed tin of beans yet they physically have had nothing added or removed other than heat.\n\nIs this something we perceive as being better because we are biologically programmed to feel more fulfilled after a hot meal, or is there a chemical change in the food which impacts flavour? \n\nAlso why is this sometime the case in reverse, I.e cold pizza sometimes tastes better than hot pizza?",

A lot of our sense of taste is actually smell. \n\nAlso, fats tend to thicken or solidify when they cool, so any flavors that are soluble in fat will be harder to detect.",

                    "comment": "essentially correct, mostly it's a volatility issue.\n\nthough, technically, much of our sense of *flavor* comes from aroma (\"taste\" referring only to the basic tastes, though I understand people use it more broadly in a colloquial sense).  \n\nsome of it is also from reaction kinetics as well.  chemical reactions proceed faster at warmer temperatures, so for example the hydrolysis of proteins and glycosides and other substrates which could generate &amp; release aromatic compounds would happen faster when the food is warmer.",

They would be chewed with the rest of the meat. When they are liquid, you will bite into the sausage and it will run all over your tongue and mouth. This allows more taste buds to partake in tasting those flavors, which easily could change the perceived taste to the consumer",

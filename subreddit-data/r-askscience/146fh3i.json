            "comment": "It depends on how the emission is collected. For example, if you don't have access to a sensitive setup like TCSPC, a boxcar averaging approach might work, which is essentially piecing together multiple steady-state measurements.\n\nSee [here](https://medium.com/@mattchiriboga1/using-the-levenberg-marquardt-algorithm-to-fit-multi-component-fluorescence-lifetime-decay-data-2ce06152fbf6) for example. \n\nOther than that, I don't know of any way to derive lifetime insights directly from a steady-state emission spectrum.",

But this theoretical method is very complicated, I did not understand anything.",

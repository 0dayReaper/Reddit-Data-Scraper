What makes the seed \"know\" that it is in a suitable environment and what does the process look like when it initiates its growing process? \n\n I know that it is water that triggers this, but more a a fundamental level what is the process in a microscopic or even molecular level. Is there a form chemical signal? or is just mechanical swelling? or something else?",

            "comment": "I'm a farmer and work with seed breeders and agricultural researchers, so I can definitely say this is a fascinating and critically important question!\n\nLooking at wheat, a plant whose product of importance are its seeds, which also serve to regrow the next crop.  Humans have two somewhat misaligned goals for their breeding programs with wheat:\n\n1) We want the seeds to be resistant to premature sprouting from rain events prior to harvest, when the seeds are still in the head.  As this can begin enzymatic processes that tank baking quality.\n\n2) But we want seeds to germinate and grow vigorously when planted into even low moisture conditions.  Because the earlier the crop is up, the better it will yield.\n\nThere are many factors that influence grass seed germination (wheat in this case). \n\nFire:  Seeds exposed to smoke or fire are primed to germinate much more readily.  This adaptation allows them to take advantage of the clearing created by wildfire.  So seeds are smoke sensitive. \n\nTime:  Wheat generally doesn't germinate as well immediately after it's harvested.  Historically some varieties were particularly bad at this when farmers were early seeding it back into the ground only 30 days or so after harvest.  The seed industry term \"sweating\" is used to describe seed that has been intentionally stored for long enough for the seed to count out its internal clock and achieve full germination rate.\n\nConversely, there will always be a percentage of seeds that absolutely refuse to germinate in the first season.  This is a population survival strategy in case an adverse event wipes out everything.  There will still be survivors in the soil bank to reestablish a population.  This is the strategy that the grassy weeds we struggle with evolved to evade our control methods.  And it's a strong remnant behavior in secondary crops like rye and oats, which were once wild and readily go feral again.\n\nI have seen rye seed lie dormant for over 5 years in the ground before reemerging.\n\nSoil Cues:  Even when seeds have sufficient moisture for germination they are very sensitive to the presence of other things in the soil.  Seeds particularly do not like to be placed into soil mixed with undecomposed vegetation.  This is a smart strategy, as they are at greater risk of desiccation there.  They likely detect the same chemicals surrounding them that they do when still within the unthreshed head, and resist germinating.  Farmers call this \"hairpinning\" - when seeds are folded within a tuft of straw tucked into soil in turn.  We set up and alter seeding implements to prevent it, or if it's not preventable we must seed at a higher rate to offset the increased mortality.\n\nWheat is remarkably stable in the whole seed form.  You can still process it into flour after decades.  And amazingly enough there are some university studies on long-term germination that get seeds over 100 years old to grow without any special measures.\n\nThere's a reason humans have partnered with wheat for 12,000 years.",

                            "comment": "This is a topic I love, so glad to help!\n\nI'm aware of various experiments that use smoke as a treatment either directly or in infused water to try to enhance germination.  I just read a Pakistani one on wheat that showed a small positive effect but it was dependent on variety.  Wheat breeding has already made seeds that are pretty good at imbibing and germinating, so I think the extra effort and risk of smoking hasn't been worth it.\n\nI do know a farmer who captures his tractor exhaust and applies it to the soil while seeding in an effort to capture carbon and nitrogen, but he's the only one I know doing that.  He and I talked about it and this smoke effect came up, but in my recent reading it seems like the smoke needs to be from vegetative materials.  Diesel exhaust may or may not be helpful,  though there are other advantages to capturing it of course. \n\nAs for stubble burning, I don't know of it being used a a germination aid, but rather to clear excess residue to allow recropping, and to help break some disease cycles.\n\nIn my region, wheat stubble is valuable in providing soil protection, releasing the nutrients it contains back to the soil, or for sale as straw.  So burning on wheat fields is not a thing.\n\nThe burning was on lawn grass seed fields (another reason why we should reduce the infatuation with lawns in America).  Bluegrass seed production has a couple nasty problems that follow harvest. It tends to host multiple diseases that negatively impact following crops, the straw is extremely tough and cannot be managed with tillage alone, and it makes pretty lousy hay.\n\nBecause of all this, the easy answer was burning.  But now it's almost all baled off and fed to cattle.  It's not my specialty, so I can't remember the name of the organism that lives in the residue, but I know it was dangerous to feed cattle in large amounts.\n\nI believe that breeding efforts, prophylactic treatments, harvest techniques and blending the feed to reduce total load have made it a manageable issue now.  I know that's the case because my neighbors who grow it sell 100% of their residue to feed buyers now.",

Several plants species aren\u2019t very picky and will grow as soon as the soil has enough moisture where the water can increase turgid pressure inside the seed and start the germination process. Other plants are super picky and we\u2019re recently learning it\u2019s because of the soil nutrients/ mineral composition which the microorganisms in the soil play a huge role in establishing and maintaining. The exact interactions or role some of the bacteria have with plant success isn\u2019t fully understood but correlation of plant success and the presence or absence of some bacteria is observed.",

            "comment": "Regarding the molecular mechanism, the \"canonical\" chemical signal comes in form of giberellins (or GA, for giberellic acid), a class of plant hormone. Dormancy is maintained by a different hormone, abscissic acid (ABA), and these two hormone signaling pathways regulate each other antagonistically. Mutually antagonistic regulation is a type of positive feedback loop, where the increase in strength of one signal (here, GA) decreases the strength of another signal (here, ABA). Because ABA itself suppresses GA, the buildup in GA becomes self-reinforcing by removing the ABA that was suppressing its buildup. Once a certain threshold of GA concentration is reached, dormancy is broken and the seed germinates. Within a brief period of time, the germination process is reversible.\n\nThe initiators for the buildup of GA are numerous and vary by plant species. The other answers here have mentioned many of them. Also, GA is just the signal for germination: its presence triggers the expression of genes that do the actual work involved, such as breaking down the seed coat and turning stored chemical energy in the endosperm into shoot and root biomass.\n\nFinally, it's important to note that the system described here is highly simplified and probably not applicable to all plants. Hormone classes and their broad functions seem to be relatively well conserved across plant lineages, but the functions of each phyotohormone class are notoriously diverse. ABA, as well as being an inhibitor of germination, is involved in virtually every single stress response, among other important processes. Ethylene (most well known for its role in fruit ripening) has also been shown to promote germination, which I suspect helps the seed sense that it's underground, as ethylene is a gas whose diffusion away from the seed will be slower within the soil rather than in the open air.",

                            "comment": "Ethylene and other hormones are sensed by receptors that bind to the hormone molecule. The binding triggers a change in the receptor's shape that then elicits some function, eventually causing changes in gene expression.\n\nEnvironmental signals are sensed in various ways, depending on the signal, and usually but not always via a transmembrane receptor. We understand quite well how certain signals are perceived (e.g. various wavelengths of light), but for others (e.g. temperature and moisture), we don't know most of the molecular mechanisms. Temperature and moisture are difficult to study as signals because they cause many different physiological effects, so it's hard to tease out the sensing of all these different responses. For example, in a different context, we know that high CO2 causes plants to open their stomata to take in the gas. But we don't know if they're sensing the CO2 directly or if they're responding to some secondary effect caused by CO2, like acidification (through the reaction of CO2 with water) or increased carbon fixation by photosynthesis.",

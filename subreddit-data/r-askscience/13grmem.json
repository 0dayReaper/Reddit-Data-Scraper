    "postText": "So the Wikipedia article on [pufferfish mating ritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pufferfish_mating_ritual) only says that one species, the white-spotted pufferfish has this behaviour and that it's unique to their species, but I find it quite hard to believe. How can such a complex set of instructions be only limited to one species? The ritual for this species might be the most advanced but surely there exist more primitive but still existent construction mating rituals for other pufferfish species, especially the more related ones?",

Scientists have several candidate species, but it seems like a safe assumption that it's another member of the same genus as the white-spotted pufferfish (*Torquigener*), as several species of *Torquigener* live in that exact area.\n\nThese nests are fairly recent discoveries...no one had reported a white-spotted pufferfish nest until 1995, and this new species' nests went unseen until 2018, when they were spotted 130km offshore during an oil field survey. It's entirely possible there are other species of *Torquigener* that also make some manner of elaborate nest, but right now we have only the one known and one unknown species.",

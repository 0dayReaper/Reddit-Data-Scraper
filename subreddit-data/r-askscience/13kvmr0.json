However our traumatic experiences are always a part of us. I like to think of our lives as a quilt - some patches are pretty,, some ugly, some downright scary however together they make something beautiful that can nurture us.  So part of recovery is integrating our traumatic experiences so they are one patch on a quilt and not the whole thing.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOn a more scientific note, there is growing evidence that if we attend to and treat the mental health consequences of trauma we will reduce the likelihood of the physical health consequences down the road.  For example, we have shown that if you reduce peoples PTSD symptoms you reduce their risk of heart disease and other people have shown this too. So one of the best things that a trauma survivors can do is attend to their mental health and that will have a big pay off in terms of their physical health.\n\nReferences:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37178469/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28052776/",

IF you specifically want an academic research career the best way to start is to get research experience  - as early as possible - in college or after college  - early research positions are boring - but work somewhere that interests you and engages your passion. read as much as possible - and find a good mentor - which can be challenging. Finally be persistent - a research career is mostly about persistence.",

That is - taking care of your mental health will have downstream positive consequences for your physical health.  Here are some papers recently published on this. Its a very exciting area and argues for putting more resources into mental health.  Also doing things like exercise, yoga, mediation, or even just activities that bring you joy and connection regularly can have big long term benefits - even small changes.

Sadly, most children will have experienced at least one trauma before the age of 18.  Which are most common really depends a lot on context as the answer differs for boys and girls for example. Violence and childhood abuse is common - but with COVID so is bereavement - and accidents are common too.\n\nThere are many different kinds of trauma so it can feel overwhelming to talk about prevention as it depends on the type of trauma. However, there are things we can do. For example violence is a common trauma that is responsible for a large mental health burden so any intervention that reduces violence can help.  Legislation that reduces car accidents by reducing drunk driving or raising the teen driving age also reduces trauma as it reduces the number of kids who experience accidents. as you can see you asked a big question!\n\nThe other way to support kids is after the trauma - to make if kids have experienced trauma they get the help they need. In some cases this may be medical and mental health treatment - but it also means making sure they are safe, making sure they have their basic needs met for food, clothing and shelter, and have adults they can rely and on talk to about what has happened. Not all kids need medical or mental health intervention but all need to feel safe and loved.",

We have partnered with Dr. Koenen today. One way to answer this question is to talk about the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) study. It was conducted by the CDC and Kaiser. It found that 10 types of childhood adversities that occur before the age of 18 - which include 3 types of childhood abuse (physical, sexual, and emotional), 2 types of neglect (physical and emotional) along with experiencing challenge such as as having a parent/caregiver with problematic substance use, mental health challenges, witnessing domestic violence, having a parent/caregiver go to jail, or having your parents/caregivers separate or divorce when you are a kid - are really common, and consequential.   \n\n\nThree big takeaways from decades of research that revolutionized the way we look at childhood adversity are:  \nA LOT OF US EXPERIENCE ACES.  \nAbout two-thirds of the 17,000 adults in the original study had experienced at least one of the ten ACEs identified in the study, and over a third had experienced two or more. It also showed that ACEs affect all communities, regardless of race, culture, or socio-economic status. Later studies showed some populations are more greatly affected than others.  \nTOXIC STRESS CHANGES OUR BODIES.  \nToxic stress literally changes a child\u2019s brain and body in ways that can increase our risk of illness, and make life more challenging, whether or not we\u2019re engaging in high-risk behaviors.  \nTHE EFFECTS OF ACES ARE CUMULATIVE.  \nThe higher our number, the greater the probability we may experience the effects. ACEs are strongly associated with 9 out of the 10 leading causes of death in the U.S. and over 40 common health conditions.",

A commonality across all trauma types is the need to do some focused work on the trauma itself - this is a common element in all the effective therapies.  However, for people with childhood trauma or more chronic interpersonal trauma it can be helpful to start by working on some coping skills - such as emotional regulation and interpersonal effectiveness skills - so people can learn to identify and manage emotions and function better in their day to day lives before moving on to process the trauma. This is the approach we recommend in our book which is cited in the bio above.",

Its an important question because many people do well after a trauma and we want to focus resources on people who are at high risk of not doing well.  If you take any mass trauma - for example I worked in NYC after the Sept 11 terrorist attacks - and even if you look at people who were at ground zero - some developed PTSD and some did not - why?\n\nI am putting an article in below. But briefly, things that matter include the persons history before the trauma. Lets take sexual assault as an adult as an example. Someone is more likely to do worse if they previously had childhood trauma or had a mental health condition before the assault - so life history factors influence response. We also do work on genetics - that is there is a genetic vulnerability to developing PTSD after a trauma.  Then - even given the same trauma - certain details influence how people respond. For example its more damaging to be assaulted by someone you knew and trusted.  Then factors after the trauma influence response - how did people react when you told them? Were you supported? Did you have physical injuries to deal with? Did the trauma result in other negative changes in your life - like did you have to leave your job or friends or home? Great question!

I am glad its being studied. the challenge is however that its hard to do a true randomized controlled trial on psychedelics. That is because its hard to have a placebo control. People who are on the drug know they are on the drug and if you are not you know you are not. This can indicate all kinds of bias into the results. the research is therefore in the early stages still at this point. They seems useful as an adjunct to other kinds of therapy. One of the arguments is they make the brain more plastic and more susceptible to intervention. \n\nAlong these lines something that is getting more attention is breathwork that induces psychedelic states. Like this for example:\n\n[https://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2021/fall/holotropic-breathwork-ptsd-therapy/](https://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2021/fall/holotropic-breathwork-ptsd-therapy/)\n\nThis is really interesting as it was first explored by folks who did early psychedelic research and then had to adapt when psychedelics became illegal. Breathwork is appealing because it keeps the person doing it in control of their experience - rather than being under the control of a substance - and also it could be used by people who can't take drugs for medical reasons. \n\nThere are many many articles on this so just indicating a few:\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7311646/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7311646/)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00943/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00943/full)",

So, yes - losing a sibling can be traumatic and have a life-long impact. There are a few key things that make the experience different between for children vs. adults. First, children\u2019s understanding and views on loss and death tracks their developmental stage. For example, children who are three years old see loss and death very differently than a child who is 12. Second, children are dependent on a caregiving network as they grow and mature, so the impact on the family system can also impact children.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; Here are a few great resources on childhood loss: https://childrensroom.org/resources/  \nAnd a great directory for locating local grief support resources:  \nhttps://evermore.org/grief-support-directory/",

I'm a PhD student in the social sciences, and I've heard debates regarding  how to diagnose trauma-related disorders - for example, whether it's best to diagnose based on symptoms or assumed causes. So I'm mostly curious as to how you recommend professionals conceptualize trauma diagnoses.\nThanks for doing this important work!",

If we think of our DNA as an alphabet - its a series of letters - that series of letters is determined at conception. The letters make words - that is gene expression. you can think about epigenetic as the font. Have you ever gotten and email IN ALL CAPS where it feels like the person is yelling at you? That is epigenetic - the words are the same but the expression of them changes with chemical modifications. Another analogy I like is that of music as I play the piano. There is the score with the notes - the anotation on top of the notes determines how the music is expressed and that is like epigenetic.\n\nHow long it lasts depends on the actual change. There are some epigenetic changes that last a life time - X inactivation for example - and some that change through life. Epigenetic changes can be different in different tissues. For example, I can get your DNA sequence through your blood, skin cells, hair etc - but if I look at epigenetic modifications of specific places on your DNA in those tissues they could look different.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6857662/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6857662/)\n\nIs one article on childhood trauma.",

Childhood trauma can have a profound impact on mental life - people often experience things like having a hard time focusing, feeling spaced out, or feeling detached and distanced. Sometimes daydreaming - or what psychologists might call mental distancing  - can be an effective coping skill. The key is that the coping skill is used 'on purpose'.

Thanks for this thoughtful question. As many of us know, ACEs are not the only kind of adversities we may face as children. Millions of us have experienced discrimination, poverty, and racism as kids, and these and other experiences can have similar impacts as ACEs. As children, ACEs can cause us to develop a toxic stress response. While not counted in an ACE score, circumstances like living in poverty, experiencing community violence, or dealing with discrimination can also cause a toxic stress response, with similar mental and physical health outcomes to those of ACEs.

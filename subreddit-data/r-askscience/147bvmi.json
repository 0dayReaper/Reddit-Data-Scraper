    "postText": "Could a quasi-star potentially develop a stable outer layer or crust during its early stage of formation if it were to be bombarded with substantial amounts of matter, coexisting with its core and the central black hole? Despite the inherent instability of quasi-stars, is it theoretically possible for such a multi-layered structure to exist?",

Like a cooling lava flow would it get a crust upon it.\nThis is what happened to earth.\nSo it would only work for rocky planets early in thier life.\nA superearth maybe more up your street",

            "comment": "It is very unlikely that a quasi-star could develop a stable crust during its early stage of formation. The reason is that the outer layers of a quasi-star are constantly being heated by the radiation from the accretion disk around the central black hole. This radiation would prevent the matter from condensing into a solid state, and instead keep it in a plasma state. Moreover, the gravity of the black hole would pull any matter that gets too close to it, preventing it from forming a stable layer around the quasi-star. Therefore, a quasi-star would not have a multi-layered structure like a planet or a normal star.",

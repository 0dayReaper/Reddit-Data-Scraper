            "comment": "Yes, fungi can evolve resistance to antifungal agents just as bacteria can evolve resistance to antibiotics. One of the problems with Candida auris is that it\u2019s resistant to a lot of antifungal agents, making infections difficult to treat.\n\nSome antifungal agents, such as ketoconazole, stimulate the liver to alter levels of enzyme production. This can impact how long some other medications last in the bloodstream and thereby shorten their duration of action, rendering them less effective (or prolong their action, raising risk of accumulation and side effects). This property is not unique to antifungals; other medications, and even naturally occurring substances found in grapefruit, among other things, can alter the liver\u2019s metabolic processing characteristics.\n\nHowever, I don\u2019t think any anti fungal agents stimulate their own metabolism and limit their own efficacy\u2026but a pharmacist might correct me. Certainly, if you take a high enough dose to cause acute liver failure, that will alter medication metabolism. But if that happens, you\u2019ve got bigger problems.",

                            "comment": "Example: you are taking an anti-fungal medication and it is no longer effective.\n\nNext step is to try a combination medication.  Maybe using the previous + new.\n\nThere are medications where incorporating a promoter helps.  It isn't a new antifungal, it just makes the old one work more effective.\n\nIf that still fails, potentially take a sample and culture it.  Take little petri dishes that are coated with various antifungal drugs, maybe in a circle pattern.  You drop your sample into the middle of the circle and watch it grow.  If it stays in the circle, that means that antifungal drug should probably work.",

    "postText": "Hi guys, I need a bit of help understanding this. \n\nThere is so much of contradictory information online but from what I understand, UV radiation can be ionizing depending on the amount of energy and wavelength, however, the UV from the sun is non-ionizing. If that's the case, then what is the process that damages the DNA in our skin cells and causes cancer?",

            "comment": "While UV radiation has insufficient energy to strip an electron from biological molecules, it has enough to move susceptible molecules to metastable excited states.  While in these excited states, these molecules react with other species within the cell to create excess amounts of reactive oxygen species (e.g. OH^(-), O\u2082^(-), H\u2082O\u2082). These ROS diffuse within the cell causing oxidative stress, including DNA damage",

    "postText": "&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Today in AskScience we wish to spotlight our solidarity with the subreddits that have closed today, whose operations depend critically on timely communication and input from the admins.  This post is motivated by the events of today coupled with previous interactions AskScience moderators have had in the past with the reddit staff.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This is an issue that has been chronically inadequate for moderators of large subreddits reaching out to the admins over the years. Reddit is a great site with an even more amazing community, however it is frustrating to volunteer time to run a large subreddit and have questions go unacknowledged by the people running the site.\n\n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We have not gone private because our team has chosen to keep the subreddit open for our readers, but instead stating our disapproval of how events have been handled currently as well as the past.",

Assuming that word means what I think it does. \n\nPoint being, the portion of overall site users who will read threads like this and care enough to do anything is most likely negligible in effect.

Though the lobster isn't my favorite long-lived animal.  And I say long-lived because we don't know for sure that the lobster is immortal, we just don't know for sure that they die of old age ever.  It's an exciting field!  On the other hand some species of jellyfish *are* effectively immortal, able to revert back to an early phase and start their life cycle over!  Hopefully reddit can do that too and go back to its old ideals!",

It's function is actually vitrification - replacing up to 60% of the water in the cells so that the cells don't freeze as the temperature in the chamber drops below the normal freezing point. The decreased temperature then lowers molecular energy so far that bio-chemical processes cease to occur.\n\nSource: http://www.cryonics.org/about-us/myths",

It goes on to say:\n\n&gt;By submitting user content to reddit, you grant us a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, unrestricted, worldwide license to reproduce, prepare derivative works, distribute copies, perform, or publicly display your user content in any medium and for any purpose, including commercial purposes, and to authorize others to do so.\n\n**That does not transfer ownership of your content to reddit.** People have pulled their content from other sites in the past because they thought such language had such an effect. The reality is that every single website that hosts user-created content has (or should have) such language in their agreement, because it would be illegal for them to host their users' content otherwise. That paragraph just says you give permission to reddit to display what you submit on their website (which is what you submit it for, right?) as well as in other media (e.g. the Upvoted podcast).\n\nIf you don't believe me, reread the quotes from the agreement.",

By disallowing submissions, and keeping a stickied announcement post, the subs can become effectively \"private read-only\" without disrupting what's already occurred or concealing any information about what's actively going on. I've noticed a lot of the \"rising\" posts in /r/all have people completely confused because their defaults are now private (which I personally think is the way to go for *some defaults* to make a statement) but if the more popular subs, that aren't directly tied in with the issue, decide nuke the ability to submit, it seems just as effective.",

But nobody aside from mods and approved submitters (a list that people must be added to *by* the mods) will be able to submit new links/selftexts. Basically it's in \"read only\" mode just like a Google Drive document.\n\nSo, if by your question you're thinking the point of going dark/private on defaults is to \"hurt\" Reddit's profit and traffic, yes, I suppose this would affect that. But this at least lets people who DO still come here know what is going on - which could be even more effective. Spreading information, *in my opinion* is better (in most cases) than going completely dark.\n\nA good example is the SOPA/PIPA blackout - many websites participated but most had an excerpt about what was going on or linked to informative parts. The mod menu only allows 500 characters to be displayed for the sub (which is what shows up when you get the \"This Subreddit is private\" message), so that wouldn't be too informative.... unless they linked to the /r/outoftheloop post, which I suppose is effective (though a bit convoluted for people who are already confused and/or new)",

This change was presumably to make Reddit a more appealing place to women, who, in many subs as well as other websites, have to hide their gender if they want to avoid \"make me a sammich\" jokes or lewd PMs. (/r/askscience is, as far as I know, a place where that isn't much of an issue, thanks to its strict moderation.)\n\nUnfortunately, instead of decreasing the objectification of women on the front page and making Reddit as a whole more welcoming, the surprise promotion to default status merely [made TwoX less comfortable for its existing subscribers](https://np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/26b8fz/its_been_two_weeks_since_twox_became_a_default/). (A search for \"default\" reveals [many similar threads](https://np.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/search?q=default&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all).)\n\nFortunately, unlike species that were made extinct by the introduction of invasive species -- [such as many on this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Species_made_extinct_by_human_activities) -- the members of TwoX are capable of migrating away from their former territory in search of other safe habitats.",

The subs don't care the she was fired (well they do, but it's not the reason for the protest). The care that she was made to practically vanish with no warning.\n\nPeople were planning to host AMAs **today** only to find, with no warning, Victoria was no longer with reddit. Most subs found out from other subs. I believe the first subs found out from Victoria herself (not even from Reddit).\n\nFor many, Victoria was the only point of communication between the subreddit and the AMAer. So now they lost all communication because she was forced to cut all ties.\n\nReddit ignored questions involving clarification and what was to happen. How is /r/iama to continue when they practically relied on her? Sure she may be gone for a good reason, but to not plan for a replacement? To not explain the situation to the people that make your site what it is?\n\nThat's what people are against. They're against the lack of communication. So it doesn't matter why Victoria was fired.

We're all volunteers with day jobs, so juggling all that takes some time. \n\nAskScience is affected by the broader issues that this incident reveals. The tools we work with as moderators are poor. They're clunky and require a lot of workarounds to function. We write a lot of our own scripts to get stuff done, although for the most part it's manual labor that keeps this sub running. A lot of manual labor, and it's provided on a volunteer basis. That is, we're here because we have a passion for outreach.

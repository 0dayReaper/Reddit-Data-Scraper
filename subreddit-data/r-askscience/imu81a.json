            "comment": "There are large areas in the middle of the major oceanic basins called the subtropical gyres. These could be considered the deserts of the ocean in that the biomass (total mass of all organisms) density and biodiversity are low. This is because the ocean circulation doesn't replenish the nutrients available in these areas for algae to live off, which are the base of the food-chain.\n\nIn general, you tend to find much more biomass and biodiversity closer to the coasts. But you can get hotspots of productivity in other places such as upwelling regions and also near seamounts [(shameless plug of my paper on this)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661116300702).\n\nVertically, there is much much more life in the surface 100 m or so as this is where algae can photosynthesise. But even in the ocean deserts (subtropical gyres) you can find all sorts of life in the deep ocean and buried in the mud at the bottom of the ocean. Just not as much as near coasts.",

                    "comment": "This is a very important point as it relates to the depletion of ocean fisheries. People assume, well oceans are massive so fish stocks are massive as well. But if you went hunting for game as a protein source you wouldn't assume it lives at the top of every mountain and bottom of every valley. You know it has a range that confines its distribution and therefore its  abundance. You dont go hunting across the vast, empty desert.\n\nCommercial fisheries know this and are squeezing the last bits they can out of the pelagic fish we all expect on the dinner table (tuna, mahi, etc), but as you aptly point out, the majority of fisheries biomass is near the coast. Fish we eat do not come from habitat that covers 70% of the planet, its much closer to &lt; 10 %.",

                            "comment": "Moreover, many pelagic fish have very long lifespans and mature very slowly. There have been several examples of species demographics falling dramatically within years of large scale industrial fishing beginning to target them because they needed a decade or more to reach sexual maturity. The fact that we catch species before having a complete understanding of their lifecycle is just insane. You wouldn\u2019t expect to be able to sustainably \u00ab\u00a0harvest\u00a0\u00bb 30% of elephant populations every year. It\u2019s very much the same for a number of fish species.                     \nEdit for example: [example](https://www.int-res.com/articles/ab2013/18/b018p161.pdf).                \n                                                                                         \nEdit 2: damn, I was not expecting this comment to be that popular but thanks for the gold guys! I\u2019m glad I could help spread this knowledge around.                                                                           \nEdit 3: someone rightfully pointed out that this issue is not limited to pelagic species but may be even more pronounced in many non-pelagic ones. I only spoke specifically about the former because I had an example in mind and large scale industrial fishing does tend to happen offshore.",

Because of this, if I can make an impact on preventing similar events, or even just help the victims, then maybe we can talk more about obligation.\n\nI see climate change in the same way. Can those of us born into an already environmentally careless society be held responsible *for* global folly? I would argue that we shouldn't be. However, even if this is true, we are still just as responsible *to* the unfortunate state of our ecosystem as any of the people who are \"more responsible for it.\" After all, we live here, and there's not much we can do except prevent it from getting worse, and hopefully in the future even make it better. \n\nIn short, I believe that no individual is responsible for the state of the environment they're born into, but it would nevertheless be wrong for those individuals to allow the environment to get worse without resistance or complaint.",

Simply practical. Shame is not inappropriate, but it is easy to ignore because it is an emotional appeal which simply does not carry much weight with the people who are presently profiting from exploiting the ecosystems.\n\nI feel it's far better to view it practically. Short term profit pursuit is the big problem, and one we need to fix. We need to make it clear that stripping everything before the next guy gets there is unsustainable. Plunder is not a viable strategy long term.\n\nWe need to stop eating our seed corn. Stop clearcutting and strip mining. It is a crop. Not a gold rush.\n\nIt's a convulsive panic at present, unbridled greed and fear of missing out. The hunger of millions is going to be tough to manage, but if we don't curtail the speed of consumption, there won't be any left.\n\nWe can shear a sheep many times but skin it only once. If we take everything, we are actually stealing from ourselves. Fallow fields replenish. Fish stocks replenish.\n\nWe need to find a system of moderation so that it can be sustainable, not for moral reasons, but for practical.\n\nIn my opinion, most moral and emotional issues are actually practical issues at root. It's not wrong to call overconsumption evil or unethical, but it is absolutely impractical.\n\nCapitalism needs a patch. At present it's a runaway process. And it will be the death of us if we don't rein it in.",

We can reduce meat consumption, but that would severely test the limits of our vegetable, fruit, and grain production capabilities which are already heavily stressed. Fertilizer runoff is damaging waterways. Organic production literally can\u2019t meet the demand. There\u2019s literally not enough acres on the planet period, much less acres of arable land, and that ignores the deforestation that would be required. \n\nThen there\u2019s the options we\u2019re ignoring. The American speed limit used to be 55 mph. What most don\u2019t know or remember is that it was set at 55 mph because of restrictions on fuel consumption set in the 70s. It stayed that way because of pollution reduction efforts in the 80s and 90s. It was raised in the early 2000s because Bush didn\u2019t care about pollution or fuel economy. We could severely reduce greenhouse gas production by setting the speed limit back to 55 mph. We could accomplish a lot by setting it at 65 mph.\n\nMysteriously, no major environmental groups are talking about these things. Free trade so beloved by Democrats increases the amount of overseas shipping every year. Ending free trade and repatriating American manufacturing could potentially have a major effect on greenhouse gas production. Again, nobody brings it up.\n\nThe 2 major problems are corporate corruption and overpopulation. Fixing the first is almost prohibitively expensive and even talking about fixing the second is taboo because of the potential of eugenics being brought up. \n\nImprove education. End free trade. Repatriate American manufacturing. Reduce the speed limit. Build a nuclear backbone for a wind/solar power grid. Move all countries to be trade neutral. Instate universal single payer healthcare. \n\nSounds a lot more pedestrian when you list actual solutions to real problems, doesn\u2019t it? That\u2019s half the problem. Most activists don\u2019t want real change. They want cool sounding solutions that punish the \u201cevildoers\u201d. \n\nThe fact is, until we fix wealth inequality and improve education, we can\u2019t fix overpopulation. Until we build a carbon neutral or better shipping system, overseas trade is killing the environment. \n\nWe *should* hang our heads in shame. Not because we caused these problems, but because we\u2019re ignoring obvious solutions because they don\u2019t make a good sound it or because we let corporations dictate public policy.",

This is simply because the relatively higher diversity of coastal fish leads to a much wider range of possible lifespans.\n\nThe description I think you are specifically talking about are demersal fish, that is bottom dwellers (halibut, rockfish, etc.). These are the dinos that live very long give their low metabolic needs.",

I could buy a few dozen crickets tomorrows and have thousands by the end of the year, millions by the end of next, if I just dump vegetable scraps into their bin and mist a bit of soil now and then. \n\nEven if they aren't the miracle cure for the resource cost of producing protein (I read they are, but you know how miracle cures turn out), they do solve the problem of depletion and extinction, as it only takes a handful of such insects to replenish a large population within a fraction of one human's lifespan.",

The meal worms were my least favorite, but they weren't horrible by any means.  \n\n\nEDIT:  On top of eating more insects, I like the idea of trying to push farming invasive species that are safe to eat, like Lionfish (without the spines), hydrilla, mitten crabs, etc.",

I know that the human body can synthesize complete protein from a variety of incomplete sources, but without any deeper knowledge there's the possibility that this is somehow detrimental compared to just eating animals for protein. It could not be detrimental at all, but I can't be sure without seeing good studies.\n\nNot to mention crickets might convert highly efficient plants into a protein source. Are there plants that are good for protein on their own and don't require lots of water and every to grow and harvest. \n\nLastly, if insect based products are capable of making desirable food items that depend on animal protein, then there's a reason for them right there. As long as producing that protein isn't as insanely costly as beef, or as per this thread, tuna. The reason I avoid beef myself is because it's catastrophic to the environment.",

When lateral transport of fluids meet an edge, it forces the water up or down, which in turns allows exchange of the otherwise stratified unmixed layers in the ocean containing what the other is missing. For coastal regions, this is the upwelling of deeper, nutrient rich waters to supply primary productivity.",

Some of them were found in significant amounts several kilometers away from any fisheries. Obviously, the short-/long-term impacts of this require more research.\n\nJust another reason to become vegan.",

Less than 2 pounds of feed produces 1 pound of live mass. They grow fast too, depending on the market as little as 34 days hatch to slaughter. That's less than half the time needed to grow a soybean. The drawback is that commercially raised chickens consume higher quality grain than pork, and much much higher quality than ruminants like cows, sheep and goats. Cattle can be raised on land completely unsuited for grain production or anything else suitable for human consumption, a factor ALWAYS left out of the vegan argument.",

It\u2019s crazy to think that we don\u2019t know what these species ( now I\u2019m focusing on salmon) do in the ocean then we expect them to return for the commercial harvest along shore. If someone invents a way to track salmon fry to adulthood I think that would be an awesome accomplishment!",

Nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and iron can reach the ocean directly from the land by rivers or dust. Also, oceanic currents and tides play a huge role in stirring up the ocean around coasts, which brings nutrient-rich water from deeper depths in the surface ocean.",

Also, why it is so difficult to find this kind of informations? This should be everywhere. Intensive farming it\u2019s brutal but at least it would mean that we\u2019re not stealing from nature.",

            "comment": "Teeming is a relative term. Typically terrestrial and marine biologists both use Chlorophyll-A concentrations as a proxy for measuring life abundance over a large scale area. This is because the producers in an environment fix carbon via photosynthesis, and the pigment Chlorophyll can be measured by satellites as a substitute for plant biomass. NASA satellite imagery of Chl-A can be seen [here](https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/4000/4097/S19972442003273_lrg.jpg)\n\nNotice, most open ocean areas have low Chl-A while coastal zones and select parts of open ocean have higher Chl-A. This is all due to the physical mixing properties of the ocean. Water is not unlike air, in that the warmest (aka least dense) water will float to the top, and the coldest, most dense water will sink to the bottom. Generally, in the open ocean this means the difference in density between the water upper layers and the icy depths is too great, and water can not upwell from the deep to the surface. To circle it back to the original question, when nutrient-rich water from the depths can not upwell, the top water columns of the ocean can not re-cycle nutrients, meaning the nutrient poor-water can not support high densities of primary producers (phytoplankton in the oceans, grass/trees/etc. on land). With low densities of phytoplankton, zooplankton growth will be limited, then small fish will be limited, then big fish, and so on.\n\n**Additional information edit:**\n\nYou may notice that the areas of high open ocean productivity coincide with the areas on this [map](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jochen_Kaempf/publication/307434835/figure/fig11/AS:601718358306830@1520472244610/Locations-of-significant-coastal-upwelling-regions-in-the-world-ocean.png). These are major upwelling areas of the oceans, generally caused by the wind (although density-driven upwelling does occur in select places). In these areas, nutrient rich waters from the depths rise up to supply vast amounts of ocean life, a prime example being the fishing grounds of South America's West Coast. \n\nAs a side bit, I'm sure you are familiar with open ocean water generally being pretty clear and blue. This is in fact due to the low levels of phytoplankton, as high concentrations will cloud the water. Look at some of the famous examples of clear water beaches (Greece, parts of the Caribbean, Pacific Atolls). Even as coastal areas, they are still low in productivity and concentrations of phytoplankton and as a result their water is clear.",

Then you get other microorganisms feeding on them and up the chain you go. Nutrients in the deep ocean generally come from two sources (any experts feel free time chime in or correct me here). The first is surface runoff from land being carried by currents far out into deep areas. The outer is upwelling of nutrient rich waters from the depths to the photic zone. \n\nWater found very deep is often capable of carrying much more nutrients as there is no light to allow photosynthetic organisms to convert these nutrients to biomass. So often when a deep water current experiences upwelling you can get very remote areas of ocean able to support much larger amounts of life than the normal nutrient deficient areas.",

There\u2019s lots of things floating around out there, and little spires poking up out of the water. It felt pretty sad to me, no dolphins, birds or flying fish for days. They made us sail back at 10 freaking knots. The admirals ride, a carrier, passed us like we going backward. Much resentment over that. I wish I could find an old Notice to Mariners, that chronicles everything they know of on weekly(?) basis.",

You\u2019re most likely to find these plants that start up food webs/chains closer to the shores of continents and relatively shallower parts of the ocean that cover our planet. Out in the middle of the ocean, yes, there may be phytoplankton towards the upper levels of the water, but that\u2019s about it. So to answer your question, the ocean isn\u2019t as teeming with life as it might appear. The most diverse life to exist are in shallow tropical waters such as coral reefs and other areas of shallow water. Some larger animals my potentially migrate through the open waters, but they won\u2019t stay there for long or try to stay there since their food source is closer to the shores instead of the middle of the ocean.",

The food web there starts with sulfur-reducing bacteria, feed by the hot sulfurous water coming out of the vent. These hydrothermal vents support life completely independently of the surface.",

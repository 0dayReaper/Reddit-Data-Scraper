    "postText": "As we know, our planets orbit of the sun and the angle in which it rotates has an impact on our atmosphere which is why we have seasons. And every 365 days or so we pass through the four seasons.\n\nSo if we look at that in a wider scale and look at our solar system. We\u2019ll see that our solar system is orbiting the centre of the galaxy and it takes approximately 230 million years for our solar system to complete 1 full orbit.\n\nMy question is that do we potentially pass through some parts of the galaxy that have a positive or negative effect on our climate during those 230 million years? I find it hard to believe that we can orbit our sun (which is comparison to the galaxy is a tiny ball of fire) and have huge impacts on weather and growth etc. Yet being in a different point in the galaxy would have zero impact.\n\nCan someone help me understand?",

            "comment": "The foundation of your question becomes: 1) What is the closest we get to other stars / solar systems, and 2) At that close range, does their heat/gravity/etc have any meaningful effect on our planet?\n\nThis isn't my field of expertise, but I would hazard a guess that space is much less dense than you might think. Furthermore, many of the forces at play (e.g. gravity), are quite importantly \\*inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers of mass\\*, which means at great distances their effect quickly approaches 0. Put another way, being twice as far from the sun doesn't mean you get half the gravitational pull, but actually a fourth (1/2 \\^ 2). And being 100x the distance from the sun means you get 1/10,000x the gravitational force.\n\nLight has a similar inversely proportional relationship to distance. Here's a short article that might be fun to explore: [https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach/education/senior/cosmicengine/stars\\_luminosity.html](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/outreach/education/senior/cosmicengine/stars_luminosity.html) .",

And that fireball is insanely far away. That's how hot that thing is. That's crazy. \n\nBut there is a distance from any fire you make, where you could stand so it is just as hot as the sun would be or hotter or less hot. \n\nSo, the center of the galaxy can be humungous but not really influence us at all, because it's so far away. \n\nI wonder if the center of the galaxy is like a drain, and everything around it is falling to the middle, eventually. And how much time.it would be for earth to end up there.",

And how much time.it would be for earth to end up there.\n\nIt isn't, but technically gravitational waves will dissipate the sun's orbital energy over time. Assuming nothing interferes (a ludicrous assumption), it would take about 10\u00b3\u2078\u201310\u2074\u2079 seconds for the sun's orbit to decay, using [the formula for merging binaries emitting gravitational waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave#Sources_of_gravitational_waves) and some incredibly dodgy assumptions to get a low-ball\u2014essentially *forever* on normal timescales.\n\nOf course, there are tonnes of things that will interfere with this (e.g. our sun dying, Andromeda merging with the Milky Way, *every* sun dying, tiny interactions with any passing star), so it's reasonable to not even consider this effect\u2014the galactic centre is nothing like a drain.",

I've seen that superclusters of galaxies (Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall) are cited as this, but I wouldn't consider them single entities because of the vast distances between the galaxies. I'm asking for a \"single\" object such as a black hole, star, or something like that. \n\n(I know technically speaking even these objects are mostly empty space since atoms never really touch, but you get my meaning.)",

That's pretty big.\n\nIs a ring system around a planet a single structure, though? Because that makes me wonder if a solar system around a star (or an Oort Cloud of comets) is a single structure, because some of those might be a whole light-year across and relatively well-defined by the way their parent star's stellar wind interacts with its neighbors'.\n\nIs the way all of these stellar systems are nestled up, heliopause to heliopause and in slow orbits of each other on their orbit of the galaxy's center of mass a structure?\n\nIt all depends on your definitions, which makes it too broad to give a satisfying answer to, really, because it's either choosing definitions painfully naively and seeing what fits them, or choosing an outcome and then assigning your definitions to the appropriate breaks in the data.\n\nThis kind of thing is why people argue about stuff like whether Pluto is a planet, by the way.\n\n**TLDR, though:** UY Scuti is a big, hot mess of a star that's bigger than *the orbit* of most of our solar system's best-known planets (Saturn would get to watch Jupiter gobbled up if it replaced the Sun), and although dying, will probably be like it is for many, many more human lifetimes (and was around for many before the first telescope was invented).\n\nStars like UY Scuti are a perfect balance of being *barely held together* because of how incredibly hot and diffuse they are, which keeps them from collapsing. It's *too much stuff in one place*, and it's only not collapsing because of how much thermal energy is keeping it swollen and roiling to the volume of 9 million Suns.",

We don't really know for sure what's inside, or if \"inside\" an event horizon even makes sense as a concept.\n\nThe concept of the singularity being an infinitely tiny point surrounded by empty space is common, but we currently have no way of knowing if that's what it's actually like.",

To my best recollection something passing beyond the event horizon instantly arrives at the singularity because time and space are warped in extreme ways causing light to not be fast enough to escape the horizon. The rest beyond my current understanding of physics",

They are in turn a few orders of magnitude denser than the general interstellar medium in the galaxy. They can be dozens of lightyears across. Are they single objects?\n\nUltramassive black holes have been discussed. They create the question of what do you consider their size to be? The size of the event horizon, which we know? Or the size of whatever is inside, which our current theories predict we can never observe, and which we probably need a well-tested \"theory of everything\" to make a good (but untestable) prediction about.\n\nEven considering supergiant and hypergiant stars. They are \"puffed up\" and have low density outer layers, meaning it's not really clear where the star ends and the interplanetary medium begins.",

We are inside Laniakea which is 250 million light years across  and contains 100K galaxies but there is a central gravitational point on it (the great attractor), which controls the movement of all the galaxies inside (though it is projected to break apart due to the expansion of space) so it is a structure. But it is small compared to the biggest structure , the Hercules\u2013Corona Borealis Great Wall at an astounding 10 billion light years by 7 billion light years in size.",

This galaxy contains jetted outflows which are emitted by the central back hole. These outflows continue for millions of lightyears before finally they come to a halt. Due to the presence of ionized particles and a magnetic field, these outflows produce radio emission, allowing us to observe them. The total distance from one end to the other is estimated to be about 16 million lightyears of practically continuous gas.",

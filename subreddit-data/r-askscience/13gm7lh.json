UV lights cleaning power is strongly (it\u2019s a squared proportion) dependent on how close the source is to what you\u2019re trying to clean. You can make up for this by increasing the time of exposure or by using more power. the most energy efficient at killing germs is UV-C. But UV-C is also unable to bounce or reflect off of surfaces. Even a thin sheet of see through glass or plastic is enough to make sure the germs on the other side are unaffected.\n\nSo at first you hang a big UV-C (UV-C only bulbs are rarely manufactured right now so you\u2019re essentially using un-enclosed tanning bed lights) bulb in a bathroom and turn it on. \nThen you have to turn it off because direct exposure causes cancer. \nOk so you only have the light on when no one is in there.\nBut the light doesn\u2019t bounce or reflect so anything not in direct line of sight isn\u2019t being cleaned.\nSo you add a bunch more lights to light up all the nooks and crannies but you can\u2019t have lights along every surface so some of the lights are more than a few feet away from their cleaning surface but that\u2019s ok because as long as they shine for longer the distance loss isn\u2019t important.\nBut people keep coming in and out of your bathroom so the lights don\u2019t get to stay on for very long so they don\u2019t have much time to clean. So you crank up the power.\n\nNow you\u2019ve got a bathroom filled up with expensive cancer causing bulbs with the power cranked up. \nSomeone walks into your bathroom and the UV lights turn off as planned and everything is germless. But then the person passes out because the room is so hot from all the bulbs and filled with Ozone. UV lights also make ozone gas. \nThey stop moving, the lights come back on and give them cancer or something.\nLol it got a little ridiculous at the end but you see the problem. \n\nThere have been some solutions with moving roomba lights but the general consensus is that they\u2019re way better for sanitizing Small areas where you can get a bulb really close and let it sit for awhile. And even in the small enclosed areas where they would be good for area cleaning (portapotties) there\u2019s no replacement for a good old fashioned scrubbing to get dirt and grime out. \n\nEven with my device it dispenses an alcohol wipe because UV light can\u2019t get rid of screen smudges.",

Generating them at high power levels (sufficient for sterilizing a bathroom) isn't easy though, and a device that could do that would likely still cost quite a bit of money which would DQ it from many cleaning applications alone.",

Don't forget how complex surfaces are at the microscopic level. Light moves in straight lines, but fluid is dynamic, meaning a cleaning chemical can get right up into all the divots, gaps and so on, that a beam of light would simply fail to even shine on.",

A robotic arm descends from the ceiling, sprays select interior surfaces down with a mild cleaning solution, sprays those down with water to rinse and retreats into the ceiling.  After that, a strong UV light comes on for a short period while air is blown through to dry everything.  Once the UV like turns off the kiosk unlocks for the next user.  This doesn't have to be a terribly complex mechanism.  \n\nMaybe it's enough to do the full sanitize cycle every ten users.  Do a partial at least to clean and dry the toilet seat and maybe the sink after each. Only do the UV once every 100 users or once per day whichever comes first.",

No system ever created has a perfect enough record to be relied upon not to UV blast some poor unfortunate, and once is too many times. \n\n Second, if you are using cleaning solution less often on account of the UV, don't skimp. Strong mix the stuff. Everywhere the light can't reach is going to be a threat. The underside of the toilet seat, particularly the rubber buffers that hold it off the toilet pan, also the hinge points and the area under the waste pipe, tiny imperfections in the grout between the tiles on walls and floors, which would normally be soaked in high strength cleaning solution and those microscopic furrows properly cleared, but will now be missed by UV. \n\n Theres just no replacement for a good janitor and a strong cleaning solution, unless you design the entire room to have practically no seams, no gaps, and VERY minimal places where light from a central source can't reach... The whole interior would have to be redesigned. Can't just stick a UV lamp and a robot arm in, and expect it to work, really. There are significant limitations to the idea, that make successfully implementing it unreasonably challenging, considering a professional cleaner will be happy to make the money doing the work.",

            "comment": "The traditional way of establishing the location of groundwater is through drilling test wells based on understanding gained from surface features (e.g., [this explainer from the USGS](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/how-do-hydrologists-locate-groundwater)). There are however increasing applications of a variety of geophysical methods for locating groundwater, some of which that do not require wells (though this will definitely improve the data). [Binley et al., 2015](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015WR017016) provides a summary of some of these methods including; a variety of electromagnetic survey techniques (e.g., resistivity, potential, induction, etc.), ground penetrating radar, seismic surveys, and gravity surveys. In terms of depth, most of these are restricted to the relatively shallow surface (&lt;10-15 meters) unless they are being applied down a borehole. Of the methods Binley highlight, only [time-domain electromagnetic surveys (TDEM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transient_electromagnetics) are potentially able to detect groundwater at depths of ~100 meters (e.g., Figure 5 in Binley) depending on the power of the transmitter / size of the receiver. So the short answer is that what they're claiming is certainly possible, but depends on what methods they're using and the quality of the data they're promising (assuming they're indicating they would do this assay without any boreholes vs boreholes guided by something like TDEM results from an aerial survey).",

Also depends on what the specialty of this company is, ie even if it\u2019s a small outfit, if the main thing they do is EM surveys, then this is not that outrageous. A lot depends on the details which OP has not provided. It totally could be a scam or it could be legit depending on those details.",

They charge around 120 $ . In 2-3 days they will be coming in my Village to my uncle's farm then i will have a talk with them how they operate and what methods they use .",

I will be adding more details in upcoming days as some people in my Village are interested and they will be getting these tests done in around 10000-15000\u20b9(120-150 $) .  \nI was just curious to know if some sort of technology exists.\nI am also concerned because i live in desert area which is very dependent on borewell as 90% people livelihood depends upon farming which requires water (rain is very poor) . Our ground water level is rapidly dropping and borewell are drying. So farmers are resorting to dig more borewells which are costly and many time can't tap water . Earlier there were some religious people who use to do predictions on where to find water but now people are becoming aware . I just wanted to know that is there that sort of tech available that can detect water 100+ meters below",

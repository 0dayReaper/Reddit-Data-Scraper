            "comment": "Usually for those nutrients to be absorbed by your body they have to dissolve in some solvents, either water or lipid. You can then try to extract everything in the fruit into this solvent, then use something like high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to separate them and record the concentration.\n\nAnother aspect of this question is the stats, since nutrient contents would vary across varieties and even every individual. I don't know how they're sampled so I would probably leave this question to other people.",

    "postText": "I visited the very impressive Wieliczka Salt Mine recently, and something occurred to me: Where are the natural caves?\n\nI'm no geologist, but I've been in plenty of limestone caves to know these basic facts (which I'm spelling out so that I may be corrected if I'm operating on incorrect knowledge): Limestone is soluble in acid, and water is ever so slightly acidic (there's also a role played by microbes). A flow of water causes the slow dissolution  of the limestone over time, eventually carving a cave system.\n\nNow salt is far more easily soluble than limestone in water, so there should have been vast natural caverns. And there is certainly water present under there, I saw it, and it needs to be pumped as in most mines.\n\nSo where are the caves?",

            "comment": "Large bodies of salt are slightly plastic under great pressure. Therefore, cavities in underground salt bodies tend to fill in over time. Here's some research on how fast it happens, citing 1% per year: [https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=3093924318ddf5d3f080466d8d87c568ab978cc8](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=3093924318ddf5d3f080466d8d87c568ab978cc8)\n\nThis is actually used to advantage in deep repositories for gases because the walls of salt cavern have very low permeability. Cracks tend to close, so the bulk salt body has very low pororosity. See  [https://www2.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsuk/download/planning\\_factsheets/mpf\\_storage.pdf](https://www2.bgs.ac.uk/mineralsuk/download/planning_factsheets/mpf_storage.pdf) for a general information sheet covering storage of many things in salt caverns.\n\nIt is also an advantage for geologic storage of nuclear material, where the expectation is that the salt surrounding the material will deform plastically over time, ensuring that the material remains sealed and is not subject to penetration by flowing ground water. See for example [https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1206/ML12068A057.pdf](https://www.nrc.gov/docs/ML1206/ML12068A057.pdf)\n\nThe crystal caves mentioned in another answer are not caves in the bulk salt, so they form by different means and are more durable.",

Can you explain that?\n\nI think the answer already inherent in this question is that the salt remains intact down there because water does not get in.  I've been fascinated with salt domes and their resulting diapirs since I lived near them in SW Colorado but only now that u/Scifiase posed it does it occur to me that it is rather odd that the salt can be so close to the surface as it is in these German deposits, and still avoid intrusion by groundwater.",

What is important here is that you wouldn't expect a hole in salt to persist for very long because it lacks the strength to keep the hole open given the overburden pressure. So you can definitely have salt dissolving by groundwater, but it's going to be around the edges of the salt structures (and the rate will be limited in part by how fast the groundwater can move away as the salinity of the water near the salt dome increases) because if holes started to form through dissolution, they'd close relatively quickly as the salt flows to fill in the gap(s).",

Where salt layers are exposed at the surface in arid climates, they form salt glaciers that flow like (ice) glaciers. Of course, compared to other viscous substances that we are familiar with (motor oil, syrup) salt viscosity is much, much higher. But despite this high viscosity, salt caverns or tunnels in salt mines deform over decades and eventually close up by the process of creep. The tendency to creep makes rock salt rather tight for fluid flow.",

Slightly acidic groundwater (either because of carbonic acid and/or humic acid) can enter the formation along the fractures and dissolve the limestone along the fractures. So it takes both for caverns to form, some rock material than can be dissolved away, and fractures for water to enter. While rock salt (especially halite, the type of salt we use for human consumption) is even more soluble than calcite, it generally lacks the fractures because they tend to close by creep, i.e. slow ductile flow under the weight of the rock overburden. Where rock salt is exposed at the surface, it will get dissolved at the surface without forming caves. Caves can form by salt dissolution if the salt forms a layer between less soluble rock formation, in which case all the salt my be dissolved away and only the more resistant rock units are left. But that would not be a cave within the salt.",

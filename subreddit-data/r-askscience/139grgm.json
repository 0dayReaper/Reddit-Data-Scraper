    "postText": "Things like hyper or hypo thyroid problems cause this; rare diseases like blood cancers; mast cell disorders; and I have heard that basic run of the mill infections/inflammation may cause it. I am trying to find information about what other problems in the body result in massive oxidative stress but it seems like it's a very new or understudied topic. \n\nI would specifically like to know about issues where the oxidative stress affects the brain. I do know that the brain is the most easily affected organ, but usually people don't experience symptoms from having things like a cold or an infected toenail. You feel sick but you don't feel massive oxidative stress in your brain. I am looking for things that would cause stuff like general fatigue and massive anxiety/depression/irritability.",

            "comment": "Extreme exercise such as running a marathon is the most common example.  Aging is the next most common as your body increases production of things and decreases product of other things.\n\nThe primary sources of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in the body are mitochondria, xanthine oxidase, uncoupled nitric oxide synthases and NADPH oxidase.\n\nThings that get affected are DNA, lipids (including phospholipids), proteins and carbohydrates.  The ROS can have a direct function such as inhibiting a signalling enzyme (uh oh, messages aren't getting where they should) or non-specific damage in the local area (e.g. looks like you have an injury and the body needs to recover).\n\nIt has been known for decades that [ROS have a huge impact on cardiovascular health](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3830063/#:~:text=Biomarkers%20of%20oxidative%20stress%20can,response%20to%20increased%20redox%20stress.).  ROS cause modifications that alter the function of important cellular proteins and signalling pathways in the heart.\n\n[Your brain already has large amounts of ROS as part of normal processes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3078504/#:~:text=The%20brain%20is%20a%20metabolically,lead%20to%20neuronal%20oxidative%20stress.)(*This review focuses on identifying the multiple sources of ROS in the mammalian nervous system...*)  It uses those molecules to signal.  However, the brain keeps the concentration in check by also having lots of *anti-oxidants*.",

Are the diseases associated with those things? I know artery hardening and damage has something to do with oxidation and nitric oxide in blood vessels, which then causes heart disease if it keeps going. \n\nDoes the effect on lipids mean something happens to your fat? Can you no longer burn fat, maybe that goes along with stuff that happens to the mitochondria since that's all energy production? If that's downstream of whatever actually goes wrong I assume that would cause fatigue, even if you don't have a mitochondrial disease? \n\nIt sounds like the body thinking you have an injury would ratchet the immune system up, but since there's no real injury then there's no off switch either like would happen. \n\nDo we know specifically what damage that ros in the brain can cause, and if it's permanent like the artery damage is? Damaged blood vessels in the brain aren't good but that's slightly different from damage to the brain itself. The link says memory and learning are affected, but how about stuff like ADHD type issues, anxiety, judgement, other specific problems?",

The study showed people with personality disorders, which depression is present in people with mental illness, have very high levels of oxidative stress. \n\n Does the oxidative stress aid in developing mental disorders or does the disorder cause high levels?",

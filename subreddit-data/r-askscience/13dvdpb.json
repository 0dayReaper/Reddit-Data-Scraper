            "comment": "Antibodies are proteins produced from B-cells, a subtype of white blood cells which originate in the bone marrow (hence the \"B\", for bone). They are relatively long-lived in the blood for proteins, having half-lives on the order of at most a few weeks. But, like all serum proteins, they are recycled and removed at a regular cadence. When antibodies are delivered into the body, without self-replicating cells to produce them constantly, their levels will decline to non-significant in a matter of months.\n\nBreast milk contains mostly antibodies of class IgA which is mainly responsible for regulating immune response in mucosal membranes like the gut. This makes sense since we don't expect too much transfer of breastmilk antibodies into the bloodstream (if that happened, then drinking cow milk would put a ton of cow antibodies into our bloodstream and cause huge immune reactions leading to death). This class is usually not associated with autoimmune disease.\n\nBreast milk also contains anti-idiotype antibodies which basically bind other already present antibodies to enhance immune response in neonates. This could lead toward hyperactive autoimmunity but for the most part because the  antibodies are transient and no memory mechanism forms for their continued expression (there are no B-cells in the child making the antibody that can become memory cells) it's unlikely that autoimmunity could be acquired.\n\nIn fact, some studies have shown that consumption of breastmilk as infant is associated with lower rates of autoimmune disease potentially because of the effects of the antibodies helping seed a healthy microbiome though more research is required to elucidate the correlation and mechanisms behind it. Here is a great [recent review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421002208) of our understanding behind the effects of breastmilk antibodies.\n\nPlease note that we certainly do not have a complete picture of breastmilk antibodies and most definitely are lacking in understanding of the mechanisms for the formation of many autoimmune disease. Exception exist to almost everything in biology, but for the most part it does not seem like there is an association between formation of autoimmune disease and the type/quantity of breastmilk antibodies ingested.",

Maturity of B-cells was first described in the bursa of Fabricius in birds, and so the B actually refers to the bursa.\n\nDoesn't really change anything, just always thought it was one of those weird things you'd think you would learn in college-level biology classes but usually don't.",

            "comment": "Breast milk is not only a completely adapted nutrition source for the newborn but also an impressive array of immune-active molecules that afford protection against infections and shape mucosal immune responses. Decisive imprinting events might be modulated during the first months of life with potential health long-term effects, enhancing the importance of breastfeeding as a major influence on the immune system correct development and modifying disease susceptibility. The aim of this review was to clarify the link between breastfeeding and autoimmune diseases, inquiring the related mechanisms, based on data available in the literature. Being breastfed was associated with a lower incidence of diabetes, celiac disease, multiple sclerosis and asthma, explained by the protection against early infections, anti-inflammatory properties, antigen-specific tolerance induction, and regulation of infant's microbiome. The protective role of human milk in idiopathic juvenile arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel diseases remains controversial. \n..[excluded the part about the mother] \n\n2018\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29083070/",

            "comment": "Autoimmune diseases apparently have to do with the X chromosome, which is inherited during fecundation. This leads that some cells have the paternal X chromosome activated and others have the maternal X chromosome activated. Sometimes the immune system begins a graft reaction against these differently marked cells.\n\n[Related video](https://youtu.be/BD6h-wDj7bw)",

            "comment": "Usually no--ultimately the atmosphere is being ionized. But there is this study--you'd need to be very far north where the Northern Lights are very strong and where you get temperature inversions:\n\n\"In an attempt to lay the question to rest, scientists set up recording equipment in the Finnish village of Fiskars and listened to the night sky. Most of the time the auroras were silent, but to their surprise they found that about 5% of the strongest auroras were associated with whistles, cracks and hisses. The researchers found that the noises always coincided with a temperature inversion (cold air trapped under a lid of warm air) and appear to be caused by the release of static charge, linked to changes in atmospheric electricity caused by the aurora\u2019s disturbance to Earth\u2019s magnetic field.\"\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/jan/05/noises-of-the-northern-lights-weatherwatch",

The theory goes that both events induce low frequency modulated radio emissions which can on occasion cause items local to the listener to make sound due to them converting the modulation directly to mechanical motion.\n\nIt may be hearsay but I've personally experienced both auroral buzzes &amp; meteor pops &amp; bursts of pink noise that cone from items around my observing site (rusty iron gates, dew coated fir trees etc) the sound most probably involves em radiation as it occurs almost simultaneously with visual events instead of delayed by a considerable time as one would expect from sound emitted directly.",

All the buildings shook violently, like a dumptruck ran into them, and the sound itself was just cool, unlike anything else.",

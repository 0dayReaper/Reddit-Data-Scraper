            "comment": "There are structures known as turbinates within the nose. Their purpose is to increase the surface area of olfactory cells and to induce turbulence in the air flow to improve air-olfactory contact. They are not boneless, but mobile, essentially like flappy meat curtains hanging inside your nasal cavity. These can become inflamed when experiencing illness or allergies, and they are also capable of moving side to side a bit. The sensation you feel is when a turbinate moves to unblock the nasal passage on one side. This is why laying down on your side often opens up the nostril that\u2019s on top with respect to gravity. The clicking may be the sound of the turbinate disadhering from the sticky nasal cavity wall, but I\u2019m not 100% certain on that.\n\nEdited for accuracy.",

Laying on your back and tilting your head will not produce as much of a shift as laying on your side, even if the total rotation of your head is the same.\n\nCitation:\nWilde AD, Jones AS.

We have attempted to demonstrate this response in\rnormal individuals. Ten individuals with no history of nasal disease or allergy were studied. All subjects\rwere exposed to sustained pressure (using a crutch) for a period of 4 min. Nasal cross-sectional area was\r measured on both sides of the nose using an acoustic rhinometer along with pulse and blood pressure.\n\r\n&gt; The individuals were then rested for at least 29 min and the test repeated with pressure applied to the\ropposite side. Statistical analysis was performed by non-parametric methods. **_There was a significant fall\rin nasal cross-sectional area on the side of pressure (median change = 0.09cm\u00b2, P&lt;0.01) while cross-\rsectional area in the contralateral nasal passage increased (median change 0.35cm\u00b2, P&lt;0.01)._** There\r\nwere no significant diferences between these results and those obtained by axillary pressure on the opposite\rside. Pulse and diastolic blood pressure rose with axillary pressure while systolic blood pressure remained\r\nunaltered. There was no difference in the laterality in the blood pressure response. The results indicate\rthat axillary pressure produces nasal congestion and both afferent and efferent arms of this reflex are side-specific.\n\nThanks for the ref!",

This means the rate at which aromatic compounds (the stuff you want to smell) are reaching the walls of your nasal cavity, where the smelling actually occurs, would be very slow in a laminar flow condition. In turbulent flow, however, those same compounds are convected to the olfactory sensors much more quickly because the air is swirling around and bumping into the walls much more regularly.",

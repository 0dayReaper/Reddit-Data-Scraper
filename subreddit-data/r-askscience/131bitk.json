    "postText": "They say that as long as we test positive on a lateral flow test we're likely to have an active infection and be contagious, since these tests are less sensitive and only turn positive when there is a high enough viral load. I understand these tests are testing for the nucleocapsid protein of the virus. Does dead/inactive virus not have this protein?",

            "comment": "Please correct me if this is wrong.\n\nA virus doesn't produce proteins on its own, it requires the cellular machinery. The protein that they are testing for is not contained within the viral capsid but rather expressed by the viral RNA when it infects a cell. In order to have a high enough level of protein in the saliva for the lateral flow test living infected cells need to be expressing the protein at a high enough level that it is detectable.",

            "comment": "Adjusting to darkness takes longer because the more sensitive rods have had their photopigments bleached (while less sensitive cones were taking care of vision).\n\nThe all-trans retinal generated when light is absorbed has to be recycled back into 11-cis retinal and incorporated into an opsin protein. This takes multiple reactions and in fact part of it happens in completely different cells, in the retinal pigmented epithelium. So it just takes a while for enough to be built back up after moving from light to dark conditions.",

Both help you when you go from bright to dim, the cones adapt quicker but do not work as well where the rods take a long time, sometimes 20 minutes to fully adapt to very dim light:\n\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-eyes-adjust-to-darkness/",

This is so they don't saturate and maintain an effective dynamic take for sight but then the effect is as OP says.  Most other neurones in the body have a different system.   Somebody can correct or add to this.",

    "postText": "To start, I'm a biologist and am absolutely NOT questioning evolutionary theory. What's been bothering me though is when people ask the question \"Why did Trait X evolve\"? What they're asking of course is \"Why was Trait X advantageous?\". Usually someone comes up with some logical reason why Trait X was advantageous allowing everyone to sit around and ponder whether or not the explanation is reasonable. If something doesn't come to mind that makes more sense, the explanation is usually agreed upon and everyone moves on. Ok cool, but we know of course that not all traits are propagated by natural selection. Some are propagated by genetic drift. Some traits may not confer a particular reproductive/survival advantage, they could be neutral, or just not mal-adaptive enough to be selected out of the population. \n\nSo, outside of inductive logic, can we ever have empirical evidence for what factor(s) caused Trait X to be selected? I can sit here and tell you that a particular bird evolved feather patterns to blend in with its surroundings, thus giving it the adaptive advantage of avoiding predators, but this may not be true at all - it could be sexual selection or genetic drift that caused the trait to persist. While some adaptations selective pressures may be so obvious that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent, many are not so obvious and we should be cautious assigning causation when only correlation may exist.",

            "comment": "I think it can only be empirically answered via experimental manipulation. Eg ornament manipulation:  male birds of species X have long ornamental tail feathers, did this evolve through natural selection or sexual selection? If you were to artificially lengthen some males tails feathers and found that they had greater reproductive success, but greater vulnerability to predators, then you can be reasonably sure that long tail feathers evolved via sexual selection (probably also performing the converse experiment too)",

More grandiose and colorful plumage means a better diet, which is an indicator of better genes.\n\nI suspect this is almost certainly correct but there are a lot of physical features that have multiple evolutionary advantages and I'm always concerned about the fallacy of the single cause.",

So does it make sense to say it boils down to sexual selection, when selection was also happening concurrently for other reasons that are tangled up in the sexual selection? Seems like an inherent problem of trying to find explanations for evolutionary history, which is that it occurred in the past and so empirically testing it in its current form is not going to offer a complete picture.",

The more we research on some features the more complicated it often gets.\n\nOne example being height in humans.\n\nOne could with the same argument as plumage and say that it is an indicator for caloric intake but when you look closer that could only be one of many causes because:\n\n- it's often relative to your own height\n\n- there is also a \"too tall\" preference wherein a mate can be too tall\n\n- there are a variety of other plausible explanations like protection from other humans for both the tall mate and the partner, competition for resources, and a lot of lesser other potential benefits to being tall.\n\nMaybe part of the explanation is that major size differences lead to higher maternal death rates in child birth and then you have an entirely different evolutionary force working in the opposite direction.\n\nSuffice it to say, that simpler experiments with less imaginable alternative explanations will lead to more satisfying conclusions but feature selection that is more complicated and has more plausible explanations will be much harder to land on a satisfying answer for.",

Surely the birds aren't doing deductive logic here. They like what they like, there's some genetic basis that affects that, and it may be selectively advantageous, but nothing in neurology or developmental genetics of the thing gives a reason for the preference.\n\nI say this because it's more problematic to talk this way in human evolutionary biology. Even if some of the hypotheses about gendered behavior having a genetic basis are true, that doesn't mean that say, women have some subconscious genetic program for assessing their mate's earning potential. There's nothing about the neurology that says why it came to be that way, and for many purposes it doesn't even matter.",

The physical features that are seen as desirable now are often at odds with primitive survival strategies, like low fat percentages. And the behaviors that attract humans are very hard to separate from the artificial and constructed environments and cultures we currently live in. It's incredibly easy to argue the the major factors of human attraction (outside of a very small handful like body symmetry) are just learned behaviors not evolutionary or biological. \n\nSure, historically many people (not just women and not all people) have been attracted to the indicators of \"success\" (which are determined by society and frequently are different between genders, class, or other identities), but what those are change so rapidly it becomes next to impossible for them to be biologically driven. It also is very hard to biologically explain the sheer range of human desires, because at the same point in time from very genetically similar individuals, you can have someone who is into statuesque muscular people, some be into short, petite, skinny people, some into large, chubby people, and a furry.",

Humans often can't even explain why they find certain features attractive, yet people believe that much less intelligent animals are having such complex, calculated thought processes? I think it's far more straightforward to assume that there's some subconscious mechanisms for attraction towards certain traits. From a theory perspective, this is also very straightforward- females that (have genes/alleles that cause them to) choose mates poorly will have worse reproductive success. This line of thought only requires, at minimum, a chooser gene to complement the chosen trait (big mane, long tail, etc), while the alternative requires a mountain of mechanisms for females to be able to make computations about how well a male must be doing in its day-to-day in order to overcome the fitness cost of the chosen trait.  \n\nThiat isn't even getting into the conversation around the usefulness of parsimony in evolutionary inference, either- as someone in the genetics side of evolutionary biology, I definitely have a lot of thoughts about *that*.",

It has been a debate literally since Darwin and Wallace.\n\nThe other person replied no with an explanation that is correct in a vacuum but misses the context here. An example that would fit your scenario is a high hip/waist ratio in women: men have a tendency to be attracted to this phenotype, and it also signals a good development arc of the anatomy needed to birth a child. You can delineate these two instances of selection based on the individual: the woman is facing natural selection for wider hips based on the mortality associated with childbirth, and sexual selection for the same trait based on its attractiveness to men vs other variations of the trait in the population. There\u2019s nothing preventing the two processes from coinciding.",

Just about every academic source I can find considers sexual selection just a specific type of natural selection. Natural selection is typically described in terms of adaptations that make a creature more likely to pass on the genes that aided their success. Even survival only matters to the extent it helps a species pass on its genes to the next generation. Sexual selection definitely fits this description.\n\nhttps://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolution-101/mechanisms-the-processes-of-evolution/sexual-selection\n\nDarwin's theory is brilliant, but you must remember he created it before the existence of a genetic code was even hinted at. (makes the accuracy of his theory all the more incredible, really.) I think it's been refined a lot since then. You would need to artificiality limit the scope of natural selection to exclude sexual selection, as everything sexual selection does is described well by natural selection.",

These moths also have behavioural traits whereby they seek out suitable backgrounds to sit on. If you make them more obvious to spot they suffer more predation, hence their camouflage and their background seeking behaviour confers an advantage. I would imagine this is quite good evidence of selective pressure to develop better camouflage in order to improve survivability.\n\nAn example:\nhttps://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2656.13817",

To be clear, I don't doubt that selective pressures exist, just that we largely can't \"know\" which selective pressures (if any) caused a trait to persist. The moth example is a good one since there is some experimental evidence. Note though there could be other selective pressures (in addition to camouflage) that cause the trait to persist (sexual selection is a possibility) but it's tough to contorl for every variable in biology. I think the study shows though that indeed camouflage acts as a selective pressure for the patterning trait, even if we can't say it's the \"only\" pressure for that trait. So I would concede that this is about as good as it gets for empirical evidence for a particular selective pressure.  \n\n\nMy issue isn't so much with actual studies, but with conversations where people claim, quite confidently, that trait x clearly evolved because it was advantageous due to X selective pressure with absolutely no study or empirical evidence to back it up. I get why this happens, we can't test EVERY trait for every species after all.  I just want people to recognize that these statements are often provisional rather than definitive.",

When Kimura and subsequently Ohta described the concept of drift, they weren't just pulling theory out of their respective asses; they presented evidence and described how to distinguish drift from selection at the molecular level.  \n\nSpecifically, positive and negative selection leave clear fingerprints on the selected genes, by looking at (ludicrously simplified) the rates of synonymous vs. non-synonymous changes in codons; selected genes show relative differences in the frequency of non-synonymous changes. You can't invoke drift without accepting that selection *can* be measured. \n\nThere are a vast number of variations that can be rung on the basic concept, that help with the statistical and theoretical validation (for example, [Codon-based tests of positive selection, branch lengths, and the evolution of mammalian immune system genes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2837078/); [Improved inference of site-specific positive selection under a generalized parametric codon model when there are multinucleotide mutations and multiple nonsynonymous rates](https://bmcecolevol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12862-018-1326-7); [A beginners guide to estimating the non-synonymous to synonymous rate ratio of all protein-coding genes in a genome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25388108/); [Directional Darwinian Selection in proteins](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3849801/)) but the basic concept is well established.",

            "comment": "It is possible to empirically demonstrate *ongoing* selective pressures through experimental methods as already mentioned, although with the caveat that the same trait is likely experiencing selection from multiple sources which may not all be captured. The widowbird study u/avolans mentions is a good example in that it clearly shows directional intersexual selection for tail length, but does not measure the counteracting selective pressure of longer tails being detrimental to survival, which they must eventually be to some degree.\n\nHowever, when considering the *historical* context of how a particular trait that has become established first evolved, I would argue that this is not really knowable with certainty. The spread of a trait through a population can occur for any number of reasons (including drift), and once established, traits are frequently co-opted for other uses besides their original function - if they were even functional to begin with. It's still of course possible to find evidence that suggests one hypothesis over another for the origin of a particular trait, but it will never be as definitive as experimentation.\n\nFor a classic example, consider the evolution of long necks in giraffes. This trait has variously been suggested to be an adaptation for reaching previously unavailable food resources, for sexual selection (though typically intrasexual rather than intersexual in this case), or for spotting predators from greater distances. And of course, modern giraffes use their necks in all of these ways! There is a significant amount of literature on the relative importance of these potential pressures; see [Simmons &amp; Altwegg 2010](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7998.2010.00711.x) for a fairly balanced discussion. I personally think the so-called \"necks for sex\" hypothesis probably has the most points in its favour, due to a pretty well-established fossil history of using heads for fighting in species predating modern giraffes and differential neck allometry on the basis of sex, but even so there's just no way to be certain that this is the reason long necks *originally* evolved. There's no guarantee that the selective pressures currently maintaining a trait are the same ones that originally shaped it.",

Many other sciences are historical too (cosmology, geology) but are accepted as having high scientific standards.\n\nHere are some types of evidence that you can use to show evolution happening: look at patterns of genetic variation to see which genes have been conserved across populations and which have drifted apart. Here is an example in humans: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2933187/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2933187/)\n\nOr you can use experiments to test responses in the here and now. Here a recent example of predation experiments in the peppered moth, a classic textbook example that has been studied for over a century: [https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsbl.2011.1136](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsbl.2011.1136)\n\nOr to take your example of bird colouration - gather some data and do some experiments! Manipulate the colour or brightness of males and give females a choice task and see what they prefer. This would suggest whether female choice is important. Or test for male-male competition in a competitive paradigm. Or count the number of mates or offspring that different males achieve as well as their survival rates. Or measure the genetic variation underlying colouration and see if is conserved across populations or species. If not, it suggests that drift is at work.",

Only that definitively assigning the specific cause of selection to a specific trait using only inductive logic is not scientific and may indeed be wrong (or at least not the whole picture). Giraffes are a great example: ask someone why giraffes have long necks and you are likely to get the answer \"because it helped them reach higher leaves giving them a survival advantage\". However, we also know that male giraffes with longer necks outcompete those with smaller ones (they fight with their necks). So longer necks may have evolved due to this selective pressure (likely both, but we can't ultimately say exactly).   \n\n\nA more nuanced example might be freckles on skin. Do these confer a selective advantage? Not that I'm aware of and I can't think of any that sound good. It's totally possible that this trait is one that is simply neutral.

My ultimate concern is with people (often biologists) stating that \"trait X evolved due to X selective pressure\" in response to a question by a layperson. This is often stated definitively without any evidence at all, but rather using just inductive logic. Recently I came across a post asking why Hyenas in India had stripes rather than spots like their African cousins. The response given was that \"the stripes must confer some sort of advantage, perhaps camouflage to help it hunt\". While I give the responder credit for not speaking definitively to the exact selective pressure (camo), they **were** definitive about it having some sort of survival/reproductive advantage. It's entirely possible the trait does not have an advantage at all. I think we need to be cautious about answering questions definitively using inductive logic alone.",

            "comment": "You're right that it is generally very hard to study the specific context which led to a particular trait in a particular species. Much of evolutionary biology is a historical science, we're interested in things which happened in some species (or set of species) in the distant past (possibly hundreds of millions of years ago). There are a few broad categories of reasons this is hard. For one, projecting back into the past is difficult in general. We have a lot of useful techniques that allow us to make inferences about evolution over long time spans, both across many species (phylogenetic tools) and within species (population genetic tools, including things like the [PSMC](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6972798/)). But the genomic signatures of things that happened in the distant past can get overridden by things that happened more recently. Secondly, disentangling the evolutionary forces acting is hard. While it's rather straightforward to talk about the generalities of evolution, how drift, selection, migration, and mutation affect genetic diversity and interact, it gets much harder to consider them all acting together. And sometimes a particular observation can be attributed to multiple possibilities. For example, we may see a clear signal of a bottleneck in the effective population size at some point in time. But was that demography (population size bottleneck), selection (a selective sweep reduces diversity), or mutation (the effective population size is a product of the real population size and the mutation rate)?\n\nNow, this is not to say that the entire enterprise of evolutionary biology is hopeless! Just that when we're dealing with historical questions, we need to be appropriately cautious (not disbelieving of everything, just cautious). While we need to be careful about the possibility that certain signals in genomes arose due to different forces, with the appropriate assumptions [we can disentangle them](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2013798118). And natural selection does leave a variety of [signatures in the genome](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822\\(09\\)02070-3.pdf) which we can look for. There are times when we can line up genomic changes and physiological effects and come to some pretty interesting insights. Studies of [high-altitude adaptation in humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_adaptation_in_humans), for example. Some research groups that do good work studying selection include [Graham Coop's lab](https://gcbias.org/), [Andrew Kern's lab](https://kr-colab.github.io/), and [Matthew Hahn's lab](https://hahnlab.sitehost.iu.edu/research.html).\n\nBut, all in all, I'd say you're generally right to be skeptical of things that sound like [\"just so\" stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-so_story), and to ask if we might just be looking at [spandrels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spandrel_(biology\\))",

            "comment": "Well, I spent years working on something called \"adaptive laboratory evolution\" where you purposefully impose a selective pressure on a population, of in this case, a bacterial species, and you let natural selection happen (I have a few published articles, worked directly with one of the most active PIs in this in the world). Cells have a certain basal mutation rate for the different types that happen (SNPs, transposons jumping around, duplications etc), and anything beneficial that happens will quickly take over the population with subsequent passages (you keep passaging cells into new growth medium with the selective pressure so they can grow up again) and we resequenced isolates that acquired selected traits (usually improved growth in a particular condition). You can literally watch simple trait acquisition happen in real time, and we dissected which mutations were causative (usually nearly all of them, as there is no selective pressure for mutations that do nothing to fix in the population, and obviously anything deleterious is selected against), and could sometimes (but often not...mainly not enough time to study every single thing at mechanistic level) figure out the exact mechanism(s) at play. \n\nA more simple example was loss of function of an import protein that had promiscuous activity with a molecule we added to the medium at toxic levels. Inactivating it kept more of it outside the cells. Many other examples but usually they were layered complex effects. We sometimes ended up with \"hypermutator\" strains where mismatch repair of mutations in DNA (one way cells correct a lot of random mutations that happen) was inactivated and these cells evolve at a faster rate by accumulating mutations more rapidly. This was mainly an artifact of being in a too controlled environment however, as these cells usually can't handle a range of different conditions very well...error correction obviously evolved to kind of tune the mutation rate with what was needed for robustness, cells that lose it lose robustness (this sort of thing causes rampant cancer in higher organisms...some people have defective error repair and they have serious issues).\n\nMaybe this is too bottom up answer for your question, but yes we have tons of empirical evidence of trait selection from the thousands of studies like I describe. Given that it doesn't take a huge amount of genetic change to take say, a higher animal DNA blueprint and say, change limb length or convert hair or scales to feathers, it's not too wild conjecture to imagine these traits arising and being beneficial, but obviously much harder to observe this in higher organisms with much longer generation times than bacteria or yeast cells.",

Any random traits which marginally trend towards tolerance bias the individual towards winding up one of the survivors and passing the tolerance further, and the drug becomes 99.98% effective.\n\nFor species with a generation time of minutes to hours, a 1 hour generation means there have been about 832,000 generations of that species since the discovery of penicillin.\n\nDarwin's finches breed at about a year old, so in that context, the drug resistant bacteria compressed almost a million years of evolution into less than a century.

These lice vary in size and shape and color. This study (and others) placed lice from feral wild-type gray pigeons on white, gray and black pigeons as well as really large pigeons, average sized pigeons and very little pigeons. The resulting lice populations \"evolved\" different colors and sizes to better match their host pigeon. I'm simplifying here but it's experimental evolution in one species that could be applied to other lice species. In other pigeon and dove species their lice tend to also match their \"shade\" and overall size to fit among feathers correctly. Obviously we can't prove that every single louse species evolved because of these exact selective pressures but it's a pretty good suggestion as to what's happening. The paper also dives a bit into genetic drift in experimental evolution.\n\nEven shorter tldr: pigeons eat/preen lice that are the wrong size to hide in feathers or a shade that stands out on feathers. Hence lice evolve to match birdies. Lots of wild lice appear similar! Yay experimental evolution!",

            "comment": "You're getting into more of a philosophy of science question, as this is the kind of thing I've noticed most researchers struggle to answer about their own field (except maybe economists, because afaik they get asked/told this all the goddamn time).\n\n&gt;So, outside of inductive logic, can we ever have empirical evidence for what factor(s) caused Trait X to be selected?\n\nDepending on how strict and classical one wants to be I guess, there's no such thing as empirical evidence outside of inductive logic (thanks Hume). But nobody cares about that, and you make clear what you mean later on:\n\n&gt;While some adaptations selective pressures may be so obvious that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent, many are not so obvious and we should be cautious assigning causation when only correlation may exist.\n\nCorrelation vs causation seems like a good starting point for getting into the epistemology of your field. Of course this applies to only some fraction of what modern science \\[any field\\] does, i.e. fitting models to empirical data, but it's still a necessary task in almost any empirical research. The problem and approaches are also presented *slightly* differently by each field (though at the end of the day the paradigm and math should all be fundamentally consistent across all empirical fields -- I don't know if that's verified though). I personally find it very useful to look at how other fields approach these same fundamental problems, so lets go:\n\nAt one extreme I think of is economics \\[e.g. [Anderson's blog on causality](https://info.umkc.edu/drbanderson/establishing-causality/) with light stats\\] -- not as a fact, but just because they probably get s--- on about this more than any other field. (On some recent podcast an economist recounted telling someone about her research and getting the response \"correlation is not causation\" for the millionth time, to which she replied something along the lines of \"Yes, we know -- that's the entire point of doing the research; what did you think all that math is for?\".) On perhaps its own extension is medicine broadly, where standards for evaluating correlation with a common language of strength of evidence have been important developments which undergo regular formal revision. Here establishing a mechanism that adequately explains a correlation is required to show causation, which is a very different standard from fields and subfields that usually can only measure wild populations and may [rely on nifty statistics](https://economics.stackexchange.com/questions/6273/what-are-the-empirical-techniques-to-show-causation). And of course [the epistemology is still debated](https://blogs.kent.ac.uk/jonw/files/2015/01/ECCiM-6.pdf) \\[my source for all the medicine stuff\\]. \n\nOne thing that's important, in a case where you can't prove causation, is whether the correlations you find give you something useful, or whether they are just as likely to be null and lead you astray. (And in some fields, even if the data only giving marginal confidence that one can reject the null, maybe you can run 10,000 more such experiments and average them out.) \\[[Russo, who is being debated in the previous paper above, [waxes on philosophically on this kind of thing in medicine](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-94-017-8706-2_46-1) I guess; I gotta end this comment.\\]\n\n\\[Response to other top-level comments\\]: Many in this thread are saying you can run a controlled lab experiment to show that a trait evolves when some condition changes, with a few different scenarios given. Ok -- how does that show that a trait that the species possesses now evolved *in the past* in response to such conditions *in the past*? That's once again an inference or induction. Even if we were in some sphere of perfect perception (again, thanks Hume) all the examples given in top comments (as of this post) would be using *analogy*, as opposed to, say, conducting measurements and then deducing the values into the past and future.",

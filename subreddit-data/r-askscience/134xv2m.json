            "comment": "&gt;\nThe only moving parts in the cryocooler are the two 2-cylinder horizontally opposed piston pumps in the CCA, and by having horizontally-opposed pistons that are finely balanced and tuned and move in virtually perfect opposition, vibration is mostly cancelled-out and thus minimized.\n\nBased on a simple image I found, they probably dissipate the wave energy rather than amplify it (the ridges in the heatsinks remind me of sound proofing foam) . \n\nEven if the heatsinks did create extra waves, they probably get cancelled just as the main waves do.",

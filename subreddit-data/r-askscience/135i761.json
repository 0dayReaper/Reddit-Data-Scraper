The glands (called castor) are extracted from beavers which are otherwise harvested for other uses.

Consider a single beaver yields about 75g of it.\n\nHow I know, I used to work at Revlon for a time and had many interesting talks with the perfumists haha",

These components all contribute different aspects towards an end flavor. For example, a simple strawberry flavor would be broken into 4 components:\n\n3-cis hexanol (leafy green flavor/smell)\nDelta decalactone (creamy peach)\nEthyl butyrate (pungent fruity)\nEthyl furanone (fruity cinnamon)\n\nIndividually those chemicals all smell/taste like mentioned above, but combined they taste like strawberry. Different strawberry flavors are primarily different ratios of these components. \n\nAnother fun fact is that all colas (coke, Pepsi, etc. ) Are based on differing ratios of spices, citrus, and vanilla. \n\nThe reason watermelon flavor doesn't taste anything like actual watermelon is because the aromachemicals that make up watermelons are a) extremely hard to replicate synthetically b) very expensive naturally and c) simply don't taste as good as the jolly rancher type flavors you see for watermelon.",

Watermelon juice is prevalent and also contributes relatively little flavor but it degrades quickly and when it does, turns brown and smells like rotting banana esters.

Highly trained flavorists use science and sensory perception to blend up flavors by mixing individual compounds found in nature. There is big money in producing new and better flavors.\n\nWhat you taste in a fruit is the combinatory effect of thousands of little chemicals with various thresholds for detection. Replicating that exact cocktail would be impossible/unwieldy, so typically flavorists zero-in on a a much smaller combination of key compounds in order to replicate a more complicated natural product.\n\nThis is why \u201cartificial flavors\u201d often taste hollow or incomplete, because they\u2019re not a full portrait of the original aroma, but more like a caricature. \n\nSometimes, those flavors taste weird to us because they are literally replicating a fruit we no longer have access to, or are from a time when we had fewer tools for analytical chemistry. Banana flavoring is replicating the [Gros Michele](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gros_Michel_banana) banana which was the main worldwide variety until the 50\u2019s, and is now no longer grown for global production. Banana flavor tastes weird because you\u2019ve never eaten the banana it was originally based on. [*citation needed, see below*]\n\n*Edit: I have been informed and some quick Google-fu has confirmed that this story, while exciting, is likely apocryphal. The Gros Michele is claimed to have higher levels of isoamyl acetate than the Cavendish, but that\u2019s just one ester among many compounds responsible for banana flavor. I\u2019m keeping my comment as-is to highlight the importance of diversifying our food supply. All it takes to disrupt monoclonal agriculture is the right* ***Fusarium***, *and keeping earthlings fed requires that we do what is best, not what is most profitable.*\n\n**Edit 2, Banana Boogaloo: The replies to this comment are appreciated, and proof that the best way to summon correct answers on Reddit is to confidently state an incorrect one.**",

After multiple agricultural plagues and other disasters, we have a totally different variety with a much more mild flavor, and so many who have never had the older variety think artificial banana tastes extra fake.\n\nSame with strawberry and grape; with grape in particular you wpuld need to go for wine grapes to find something similar to artificial grape flavor, since grapes grown for raw consumption are massively inflated with a much lighter flavor. The same can be said for strawberries, also strawberries on store shelves are rarely fully ripe. They gain more flavor as they darken, like tomatoes, but will not darken easily off the branch, like tomatoes.",

Chocolate is an extreme example of this.  It takes a multitude of chemicals to give chocolate it's aroma and flavor:  purine, theobromine, caffeine, vanillin, dextrose, fructose, sucrose, lactose, tannin, casein, cocoa butter, and milk fats; plus a multitude of other acids, alcohols, aldehydes, amines, aromatics, esters, ketones, lactones, pyrazines, and pyrroles.  Over [600 compounds have been identified in chocolate](https://ift.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1541-4337.12180). And at least [39 have been found necessary to reproduce the aroma](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jafc.0c05787), an important component of flavor.",

A single fruit can be expressed in different ways such as dried, fresh, rotten, boiled, unripe, etc. The extraction process is inefficient and damages the flavor profile. Analysis is often sketchy - some of the key flavors are found in trace amounts. \n\nI don't think flavorists start from analysis at all. They should be attempting to recreate nature, not mimic it, with the flavor molecules they have on hand. There are various market reasons why they would do this: mainly for flavor stability at different pH levels and exposure to temperature etc. Flavored water is a good example. Most taste molecules won't directly dissolve into pure water.\n\nEven the artificial synthesis process can have an impact, it's well known that vanillin ex lignin may taste different from vanillin ex eugenol etc. This comes down to trace molecules such as anisaldehyde or ethyl vanillin found either in nature or the synthesis process.\n\nConsumer expectations play a larger psychological role in flavor identification as well. Real Wasabi tastes different from the dyed horseradish typically served, but the latter is what comes to mind as wasabi. What should sakura blossoms taste like? The fact that cherry blossoms literally have zero flavor does not stop KitKat from making cherry blossom flavored kit kats.",

It literally doesn\u2019t matter the slightest amount except I can hear my HS French teacher (probably long dead or at least in her \u201890\u2019s) screaming in agony every time my eyes slide over the final \u2019e.\u2019  Also, artificial banana flavoring doesn\u2019t taste like any kind of banana, Gros Michel or Cavendish or any other. It tastes like horrible plastic poison and should be banned.",

            "comment": "In organic chemistry class I learn that the compound that give fruits their smell is often an ester. Since smell is heavily involved in taste adding this compound can mimic the fruit. These esters can be easily synthesized by combining an organic acid with an organic alcohol. Different combination give different fruit flavors.  For example grain alcohol (the type you drink) with vinegar give a cherry our grape flavor.",

I think it's skittles that all the colors are the same flavor but some people will still taste a difference between the colors if they can see them.\n\nSo some of it is finding compounds that have fruity tastes or actually using some of the actual fruit. But another component is just using our brains to trick us into perceiving what they want us to. This last part can make people very angry when they learn how it works.",

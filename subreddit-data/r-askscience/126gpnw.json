            "comment": "Definitely for foods and some other things, very early exposure reduces the risk of allergy.\n\nThe last 20 years of aggressively avoiding peanuts for babies has caused a 20x rise in peanut allergies.\n\nTurns out that giving babies (under 6 months old) small amounts of peanuts SIGNIFICANTLY reduces their risk of peanut allergies.\n\nI don't know if there's great data on things like fragrances.\n\nTHere's pretty good data that \"overly sterile\" environments contribute to allergies.  Babies who grow up in households that regularly sanitize all surfaces have significantly more allergies.\n\nBabies who are given sterilized pacifiers end up with more food allergies than babies who are not given pacifiers or who are given unsterilized pacifiers.\n\nJohns Hopkins says:\n\n&gt;Infants exposed to rodent and pet dander, roach allergens and a wide variety of household bacteria in the first year of life appear less likely to suffer from allergies, wheezing and asthma  \n&gt;  \n&gt;Infants who grew up in homes with mouse and cat dander and cockroach droppings in the first year of life had lower rates of wheezing at age 3, compared with children not exposed to these allergens soon after birth. The protective effect, moreover, was additive, the researchers found, with infants exposed to all three allergens having lower risk than those exposed to one, two or none of the allergens. Specifically, wheezing was three times as common among children who grew up without exposure to such allergens (51 percent), compared with children who spent their first year of life in houses where all three allergens were present (17 percent).  \n&gt;  \n&gt;In addition, infants in homes with a greater variety of bacteria were less likely to develop environmental allergies and wheezing at age 3.\n\nThey also point out:\n\n&gt;children who grow up on farms have lower allergy and asthma rates, a phenomenon attributed to their regular exposure to microorganisms present in farm soil.\n\nThe old addage of \"eating a little dirt is good for you\" probably holds scientifically based on the data.\n\nLiving in a bubble of sterilization DEFINITELY contributes to increasing incidence of allergies.",

The immune system is like a car engine and the gas to air mix must be just right otherwise you get backfiring or burn oil, etc. But in the case of the immune system you can get allergies, asthma, and all sorts of autoimmune issues.

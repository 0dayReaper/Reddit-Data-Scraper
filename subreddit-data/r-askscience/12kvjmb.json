    "postText": "I noticed this broad trend across and within materials, like metal oxides vs silicon, low-dimensional perovskites as a function of n, graphene. Not sure about III-Vs, but I think it's there too. Is it to do generally with the size of the gap relative to kT? Also, is the effect ever significant enough to affect upper bounds on, say, photovoltaic device fill factor?",

            "comment": "The average speed of a carrier can be roughly modeled by how much \"collisions\" it encounters when moving in response to an electric field.  The more collisions an electron encounters, the slower it's average speed. A higher bandgap means fewer bands for a given electron energy giving it \"less room\" to travel.  This increases the collision rate, and reduces the speed and increases it's resistance.",

                    "comment": "Thanks for answering! I'm with you on collisions as a speed-determining factor. Could you elaborate in a more quantitative way on the idea of fewer bands and less room for the electron to travel? My understanding of what you said there is that a larger band gap means lower density of states at the band edges, but I can't reconcile that with my understanding of how band gaps arise. I think of band gaps as no states, but the available states above and below the gap may or may not be plentiful in a way that's not closely related wrt to gap size.",

If you walk along the center of this road you will have to traveled the entire squiggly road distance.\n\nNow imagine if this exact same squiggly shaped road was 10 meters wide and you weren't constrained to walking in the center of the road. You could kind of walk in a path that goes through the inner radius of each curve so to minimize your turning (acceleration) and distance traveled.\n\nSo a wider road, or a band with more states allows for less restrictive travel.",

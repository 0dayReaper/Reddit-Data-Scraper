When the coloured units are relaxed they are small enough not to influence the visible colour. \n\nQuite how they know which colours to do and how they coordinate it is still in I'm pretty sure, but a large proportion of their big brain is dedicated to colour change.\n\nEdit: one thing I didn't clarify well is that there's one pigment per cell and the cells are distributed evenly across the skin, rather than each cell containing every pigment. \n\nThe cells are called chromatophores \n\n[here's a fun video of those cells in action](https://youtu.be/hNZ8Ui5Txbc)",

The difference is their brain is unable to support somatotopic representation or point-for-point mapping of the body due to the complexity of how their body can move. The second is the extensive autonomy in sensory processing and motor control of the arm nervous system (the brain has absolute control over the arms, but it needs visual association with \"x\" arm to do non autonomous actions).",

But only in cases like accidentally resting your hand on the stove.

That\u2019s why your hand can jerk away a split second before you can register the heat and pain. It\u2019s strictly instinctive.",

Half of the bars in that grill were *warm*--not even uncomfortably warm, just definitely warm--and the other half were chilled.

This is true for many sensory pathways in vertebrates.\n\nEdit: to be clear, the vertebrate brain is a deliriously complex network compared to invertebrate brains, and in humans does far more processing that the rest of the CNS combined. What I\u2019m talking about here is the claim that was made, which differentiates cephalopod nervous system plans as mostly distributed, as opposed to vertebrate nervous system plans being entirely centralized in the brain. Both characterizations are incorrect.",

To clarify, I'm coming at this from the perspective of an artist who works heavily in digital art, with a bit of experience in printing and in painting.  So, I'm very familiar with how techniques like pixels, halftone, and dithering are used to mix a limited array of colors into millions of colors.\n\nI was kinda trying to extend the analogy.  Pixels on a monitor generally have a wide array of brightness levels for each sub-pixel (generally 255 discrete levels in the current conventional digital format) .  If they were either on or off, they'd be limited to purely black, white, red, green, blue, cyan, yellow, and magenta. So I was wondering how the chromatophores are manipulated to different color intensities to get the broad array of different colors we see these animals making.\n\nBut I guess you sort of answered that saying that they might activate some chromatophores of a certain color, rather than every one over a certain area, to create a partial color effect?  Which kinda sounds like the half-tone dot example, by way of how many cells are activating rather than lots of cells being partially-activated.",

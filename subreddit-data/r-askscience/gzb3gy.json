    "postText": "\nI often see articles about breakthroughs in eradicating cancer, only to never hear about them again after the initial excitement. I have a few questions:\n\n1. Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs\u2019 effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media\u2019s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people\u2019s hopes for a cure to get revenue.\n\n2. While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?\n\n3. What are the major hurdles to actually \u201ccuring\u201d cancer universally?\n\nHere are a few examples of \u201cbreakthrough\u201d articles and research going back to 2009, if you\u2019re interested:\n\n2020: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/health-51182451\n\n2019: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/06/190604084838.htm\n\n2017: https://www.google.com/amp/s/time.com/4895010/cancers-newest-miracle-cure/%3famp=true\n\n2014: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140325102705.htm\n\n2013: https://www.cancerresearch.org/blog/december-2013/cancer-immunotherapy-named-2013-breakthrough-of-the-year\n\n2009: http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/12/17/cancer.research.breakthrough.genetic/index.html\n\nTL;DR \nWhy do we see stories about breakthroughs in cancer research? How can we know what to be legitimately excited about? Why haven\u2019t we found a universal treatment or cure yet?",

(Though obviously there is tremendous work yet to be done.)\n\nOften, new treatment technologies, while genuinely promising, fail to fully live up to that initial promise.\n\nPop science and medical news reporting often exaggerates or overstates the potential of emerging technologies. Even responsible journalism is often sensationalized to bolster reader interest.\n\nFinally, there are MANY different forms of cancer with wildly different causes, characteristics and disease processes. It is pretty unlikely that we will ever see any single \"cure\" for all types of cancers.",

Cancer refers to a whole range of different things, which can loosely be called \"abnormal cell growth\". Your body is often fighting cancerous growths off before you ever realise. \n\nWe will just improve treatments until they are so good we can deal with most cancers (hopefully), but it's likely to be a mix of different treatments for different cancers depending on a massive range of individual factors.",

Elephants have a huge number of p53 genes. p53 is a watchdog for DNA. It is so important that that vast majority of human cancers have to mutate p53 to survive. Elephants get around this problem by having many copies of p53.

If you could just boost your immune system, you would likely increase allergies and autoimmune disease.  Our immune system evolved to balance these factors to increase our chances of survival, a single tweak likely won't help much or might even throw off this balance and do more harm than good.  Elephants likely evolved other mechanisms to compensate for what would otherwise reduce wound healing in humans.  It's like trying to swap one part from a car's engine to one of a different make and model.  That one part works great in the first car, but without fully understanding how it works within the engine it would be impossible to integrate into the second car, and the second car will likely require further modifications to accommodate that part and see any gains in performance.",

First, let\u2019s clear up a small bit of confusion and establish some definitions. Telomeres are caps at the end of chromosomes that protect the chromosomes when cells divide. Each cell division erodes the telomere just a little bit. All cells contain DNA encoding for a protein called telomerase, which rebuilds the telomere. Most cells, except stem cells and immune cells which divide rapidly throughout even an adult organisms life, do not express telomerase. Telomerase is \u201cturned off\u201d in almost all other cells. Cancers often turn on telomerase because they must divide rapidly. Oddly enough, the fate of the average cancer cell is to die quickly. When cancer messes around with its genome, almost all changes will be bad. Most will kill the dell. To evolve, the cancer cells therefore divide very quickly, with most dying but some surviving. They undergo so many divisions that telomerase is required for them to live. I don\u2019t think of telomerase and p53 as connected pathways to cancer. Activating telomerase and mutating p53 are just two critical steps enroute to cancer. They are keys to \u201cdividing endlessly\u201d and \u201cmutating genetic code\u201d respectively. If you want to get an idea about what cancer must do to survive, google \u201challmarks of cancer.\u201d The thing is, having long telomeres isn\u2019t really helpful for most human cells. You have cells that are almost as old as you (some nerve cells and muscle cells may live for your entire life). Telomeres caught the public imagination because some unproven ish science suggested that telomeres could be the cause of aging. I don\u2019t really think this is the case. Telomeres are important, however, for the reasons mentioned above. With respect to long lived organisms like sharks, it is again important to consider the difference between living for a long time and large size. Cancer happens when cells make a genetic mistake and divide. The probability of this happening is nearly uniform for each cell. Larger organisms have more cells, so they should get cancer more than we do. They don\u2019t get cancer very often because they have mechanisms, like lots of p53 genes, that protect them. However, organisms that live for a long time may not necessarily undergo many cell divisions, which would make them resistant to cancer (i.e. the box turtle which lives for a long time but is small). In the case of sharks, a few google searches suggest that they have immune system changes that protect them. These papers are recent, so I suspect the area is not fully fleshed out yet. In my opinion, sharks are an excellent future route to find cancer fighting insight in the natural world. This was a very nice question. Thank you. I hope that helps!",

This paper with the delightful name [Return to the Sea, Get Huge, Beat Cancer](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/8/1746/5485251) (Step 4: Profit??) seems to indicate that whales have developed a number of adaptations to slow mutations in most DNA regions, but have a relatively high mutation rate in those regions that produce tumor suppressing proteins, as well as some duplications of these genes. This is not my area of expertise at all, though; this is just from me searching and skimming a bit, so take it with a grain of salt.",

I only understand it at it's simplest (not a researcher) but it basically regulates the cell cycle and can halt the cycle if the cell is damaged. (Damaged cells that can continue through the cell cycle will replicate unregulated which we know is cancer.) Healthy (non cancer prone) humans have 2 copies of the P53 gene. Elephants have 40 so they are much better at suppressing tumors and stopping damaged cells from reproducing.",

Sometimes you get a mutation that sends a pro-growth protein into overdrive, other times it's an anti-growth protein that gets shut down. Sometimes whole segments of DNA get lost or duplicated, changing the amount of protein that gets made. And this isn't even getting into all the reasons that the DNA might have developed a mutation in the first place. So it's hard to identify one specific problem like \"improving cell replication.\"\n\nThat being said, it's not like there aren't things that can be done, at least in theory. Elephants, for example, [get significantly less cancer than humans](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/how-elephants-defend-against-cancer). This seems to be because they have a lot more copies of a protein that causes cells to kill themselves when they sense DNA damage. This could, potentially, inform ways that we might be able to significantly slow the rate at which cancer occurs in humans. Not likely any time soon, but eventually. Find enough strategies like this and maybe you can reduce cancer rates enough that hardly anyone develops it before something else kills them first.",

Most traditional chemotherapeutic agents work by inhibiting cell division. Unfortunately, that is why traditional chemotherapy is so toxic; it also inhibits healthy cell division.  Many of the common adverse effects you see with chemotherapy are on cells in the body that normally have rapid cell turnover:  patients become immunocompromised because white blood cell production is inhibited, clotting abnormalities occur because platelet production is inhibited, the lining of the gut and the mouth are affected, and of course you see hair loss.  There are treatments available to counteract the effects on specific cells, such as colony stimulating factors (CSF) that increase the production of white blood cells.  Instead of looking at therapies that stop cellular duplication in general, many more recent approaches do the opposite: Target a specific type of cell or specific abnormal step in cell division.",

There is no general one size fits all solution because there are multiple mechanisms that can result in abnormal cellular proliferation.

Some are associated with better outcomes to chemotherapy, while others have very low success rates with chemo but have a targetable allele that a commercial drug can help with.\n\nAnd even across cancers there can be similarities and differences. A drug mostly intended to target mutated genes in breast cancer might be totally viable for a bladder cancer patient because of the similar genetic profiles.\n\nThat's where it gets hazy: should the cancer in one patient's breast and another's bladder really be called different cancers if they have the same genetic/pathologic profile?

I also have a much better understanding of the significance of things when I see articles about new studies or potential treatments, or even references in pop culture (I was in a drug trial to prevent the infection that ended Tom Hanks' character in Philadelphia).\n\nBut that's all because I learned a lot of details since it was very personal for me. I wouldn't expect most people to know those details. They don't see how much the slow, steady march against cancer has actually improved things, not just in survival rates but improvements in quality of life during and after treatment.\n\nAnother personal example, for my leukemia treatment, instead of a \"bone marrow\" transplant I had a \"stem cell\" transplant. Stem cells are a big buzz word, so there's a lot of preconceptions and misconceptions, but here's how this particular use was explained to me. For my end, they're essentially the same, but it's much, much easier on the donor. Going into the bone is extremely painful (I can attest to this thanks to biopsies), so for a bone marrow donation they have to be anesthetized. The new way, the donor is give a special drug for a week or so that causes bone marrow stem cells to migrate from the bone marrow into the blood stream. Then they can be harvested like a normal blood/platelet donation. Easier donation = more donations = more patients healed. Not a flashy headline, but real progress.",

                    "comment": "&gt;Finally, there are MANY different forms of cancer with wildly different causes, characteristics and disease processes \n\nI'd like to expand on this because this is the most important reason.\n\nThe thing with \"cures\" is that people tend to think that it's just a \"magic substance that does things\" and now you're not sick. It's not like that. It's a very hard and, most importantly, **long** process of testing and ponderating pros and cons. It's relatively rare to see a perfect cure because human bodies react differently to the same *cure*, and different *cures* often bring different results, depending on the patient the professional can recommend one or another.\n\nThe thing with cancer is that \"cancer\" is not a sickness, cancer isn't but a particularly destructive mutation. Basically, the cells have a syste that tells them to kill themselves when the right moment is due, and to stop multiplicating likewise. A cell can misdevelop that system, and become unable to respond to that command, hence reproducing non-stop. This cell cluster then can even form new organs, blood vessels, or just become dangerous because of its own presence, these cells still ask for resources, still occupy space that press on existing organs, the body is pretty tight so a tumour can be dangerous on its own.\n\nWhen that happens, the body has tools to deal with that, some cells of the immune system can go and kill those cells, but sometimes that fails, and that's when the thing has to go into other hands, literal hands. That's when chemotherapy comes in hand. The thing is that chemotherapy does not cure cancer, it just kills cancer cells, and cells period, so it's prone to cause collateral damage.\n\nReturning to the other topic, cancer itself is tough because, as stated, it's not a single sickness, but instead a misformation of the body. With that in mind, that misformation can be because of lots, **lots**, **LOTS** of things, and the thing to treat it can also be different, the \"cure to cancer\" can be different, there are places where some things can reach and some cannot, there are parts of the body only accessible through bloodstream, some even with that is not so easy. Overall, the \"cure to cancer\" is almost a case-to-case scenario.",

As I'm sure you know, even if the general population won't like to hear it, the harsh truth is there will never be a universal treatment for cancer.  There are so many different driver mutations for tumorigenesis that you can't target them all with one treatment.\n\nPerhaps a universal CRISPR therapy that removes/edits the tumorigenic mutation, but the problem is that as tumors grow they acquire many more secondary mutations, so you would have to remove the initial driver mutation very early in tumor development.  With current medicine, if you find the tumor that early your prognosis is already good to excellent, so why use CRISPR in that scenario?",

Draw from a healthy donor, remove all the DNA that would code for recognizable antigens, and insert the CAR as is done presently.  For a given tumor, like B-cell lymphoma/leukemia, the tumor antigen is the same (CD-20), so this \"off the shelf\" approach theoretically can work.  And it's quicker, just infuse right away rather than wait ~3 weeks.\n\n\nThough, it's actually amusing following clinical development, just a few years ago CAR-T was considered a god send, and already there are a bunch of new biotech companies hating hard on traditional CAR-T as if it's this piece of shit therapy lol.",

One of the sources listed says it was able to unlock the genetic structure of a certain cancer or something to that extent. While it is a breakthrough to see how the cancer may develop or spread, it isn\u2019t the whole picture. It\u2019s similar to how you may have pictures of a particular engine, but that doesn\u2019t mean you know how to build the engine or change it in a way that will make it more efficient. \n\nAnother source stated a type of T-cell was found that can distinguish between cancer cells and normal cells and would leave the normal cells alone. That is great that we have found that type of T-cell. But without being able to control that T-cell and make it do exactly what we want or to duplicate for the benefit of others, it is hard to move past the \u201cbreakthrough\u201d point.\n\nOther examples may be finding a certain drug or treatment that is extremely effective against a certain kind of cancer in lab rats. That is good for knowledge of how it may be used in humans, but human physiology is very different from rodent physiology. It can take a very long time to make the transition between the two. Or after they have made the transition to human testing, they can find it\u2019s no more effective than the other treatments we currently have. \n\nAlso, at least in the case of the United States, it can take many years for even simple drugs to go through the multiple phases it takes to go from initial testing to FDA approval. Drugs for more complicated conditions can take longer as they may be more risky and so they start with lower doses and wait longer to see if there are any side effects. With a smaller pool of candidates (like with rare cancers) it\u2019s harder to get a clinical trial going so that can add time as well. \n\nAll said, many of the breakthroughs are wonderful things and we can learn a lot from them, but it\u2019s hard to translate this new knowledge into a practical form of treatment that works reliably across multiple types of cancers and the different body types.",

Often times cure is a relative term in cancer because many patients just go into remission on and off for years. Many drugs provide a relative cure for a certain period of time but their effectiveness wears off over time. \n\n There are also so many causes of even just the same type of cancer. A lot of research is just discovering the differences. For example p53 is common in many cancer but a lot may also been caused by say a genetic disorders or environmental exposure that have changed other genes. They can have either one or many of these things contributing to their cancer. So a cure may only work for a vary small subset of that cancer population even if it's a common cancer. That's even  if even gets that far in trial. \n\nAdditionally, laypersons are invested in cancer research on a top level because they give to charities, participate in events or know someone with cancer. So they want to hear about stories of people beating cancer or drugs that cure.",

For example, blood cancers has better treatment outcomes than solid tumor relatively speaking. So studies that find a cure for specific types of leukemia doesn't automatically mean that they've also found a cure for solid tumor. For example, CAR-T has had great success with lymphoma, but not as effective for solid tumor.\n\n- There have been great breakthroughs. But like I said, a breakthrough in one type of cancer doesn't mean it works for all cancers.\n\n- Breakthroughs in cancer often means extending the patient's life by a few months or a couple years, instead of total cure. There are a few reasons for this. One of them being that treatments work best if given to patients in early stage of the disease. However, patients typically only received the expensive new treatments if they have failed more conventional treatment, and this reduces the efficacy of the new treatments. \n\n- Clinical trials take a looooong time. It takes years to get approval for any new drugs and treatments. Often things make it to the news because of a successful animal study. Add about 10 more years for when the drug would hit the market.\n\n- The news isn't for you. Now this is a bit of a cynical view on the whole thing... But more often than not, the press release on early successes of a drug isn't written with the generally public in mind. They are for potential investors and existing stakeholders. This is how a company showcases that it has hit an important milestone. Clinical trials are very expensive to run and companies need to continually attract investor funding. This is one way to do so.",

Same for imatinib, Chronic myelogenous leukemia was basically a death sentence but the drug slows the cancer essentially to a halt and people live with the cancer well into their 80s and usually die of a heart attack or stroke. And all-trans retinoic acid essentially takes cancerous blood cells that are immature and immortal, usually killing the patient in a year, and basically pushes them passed a cell division checkpoint causing them to mature and die like they would normally as a part of their life cycle. \n\nBasically take any cancer survival rate from 30 years ago and compare it to today.

For example, the 2013 article talks about immune checkpoint inhibitors, which have been approved for several cancers. For examplee, in late stage metastatic melanoma, they have increased long-term survival from &gt;2% to about 40%. Such improvement has never been achieved by a single class of drug in any cancer, ever. Child leukemia mentioned in the 2017 article now has a &gt;95% remission rate, whereas it was absolutley deadly a few decades ago.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor some other \"breakthrough\", the drugs are still in clinical development. It takes many years (10-15+) to develop a drug based on a biological finding in the lab.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSome others have been hindered by toxicity issues or disappointing results in clinical trials. This point is important to remember: most drugs who enter clinical trial will never be used in the clinic, and there can be mulitple reasons for that.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe media also has a role to play in these seemingly disappointing results, as they often fail to understand the limitations of a specific scientific report, or will use sensationalism for, you know, business reasons.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n2) Unfortunately, it is often difficult to discern facts from exaggeration, especially as a non-scientist, as the only way is to go back to the original research. Many articles will report a new drug that \"kill cancer cells\", but won't state, for example, if they also kill healthy cells. One indication of the quality of a specific research article is to look where it was published. An article published in a very low impact factor scientific journal is unlikely to revolutionize medicine. But ultimately, a new therapeutic strategy exposed in a Nature paper may very well turn out to be a total disappointment when applied to humans.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n3) Each and every cancer is a different disease, with different driver mutations, not only between types of cancer, but also between patients with the same type of cancer. The body  is incredibly complex and it will often react to a drug in different ways. Another layer of complexity is added by the drug resistance phenomenon. Many drugs will initially induce great results. Unfortunatley, cancer cells are genetically unstable, very heterogenous, and thus very adaptable. They will often find ways to evade the action of a certain class of drugs, and the mechanism of resistance is often very diverse according to patients. Therefore, it is extremely unlikely that a universal cure for cancer will ever be found.",

            "comment": "There are a couple reasons here.\n\nThe first is that coming out with a treatment takes time. Once a target is identified it can take a year or two to run the appropriate preclinical mouse and other studies and develop the drug. Then several years more for the clinical trials to run.  For the articles you posted from 2020 and 2019, not enough time has passed to make viable treatments off those discoveries.\n\nThe second is the variety of cancer. Cancer is any cell that grows in an uncontrolled way in your body. This means that any tissue type could become cancerous using any mutations that induce uncontrolled growth. This in turn creates a huge amount of biodiversity in cancer which means a single treatment is unlikely to be able to treat all cancers. As an analogy you can think about how one treatment doesn't work for every virus (flu meds won't necessarily work for covid, and hepatitis treatments won't work against ebola, etc.)\n\nThe third is that there have been some phenomenal breakthroughs in treating cancer in the last decade in a half thanks to one man in particular, James Allison, and the rise of immunotherapy. But what we consider a breakthrough is not as glamorous as what the general public may consider a breakthrough. Immunotherapy is using the body's own immune cells to fight cancer instead of treating the cancer directly with drugs. And in one of the first trials for a type of immunotherapy called a check point inhibitor, a small, single digit % of patients lived for years afterwards (so long that they stopped keeping track for the trial) and showed no relapses. These were stage 4 patients who didn't really have any chance of survival who then went on for decades now and raised families and were (we really don't like using this word for cancer, but I'm going to anyway) essentially cured. This was a major breakthrough but it only affected a small % of a single type of cancer indication, but the mantra in the industry became, raise the tail (referring to increasing that small % of long term survivors to higher % values). That is a huge breakthrough by our standards, but not anything close to a universal cure.\n\nAs far as clues to indicate whether a piece of mainstream media is hyping up or over exaggerating the impact of some new discovery, there's a checklist you can use.\n\n\\-Is the discovery they are referencing published yet (as in is there a peer reviewed paper about this breakthrough in a respectable scientific journal)?\n\n\\-What stage is this discovery in? As in has it just been performed on cells in a perti dish, is there only mouse data, or is there data in humans? Mouse data and in vitro data (data on cells in dishes instead of in whole animals) are often not repeatable in humans so claims that there's a breakthrough at that stage warrant scrutiny.\n\n\\-Is the discoverer making outlandish over grandiose claims? There was an Israeli lab a few years back that claimed to be able to cure all cancers within a year using targeted peptides (a not terribly novel technology), obviously that was too bold a claim to be accurate.\n\n\\-Is the lab in question funded by a group with a political agenda? For instance a PETA funded lab making a claim that veganism cures all cancer, or a lab in a dictatorial country making grandiose claims that the state news network can use as propaganda.\n\nThere are probably other good metrics that I'm not thinking of right now, but that is a good starting point to weeding out falsely inflated stories about breakthroughs.",

This step can take a long time and is consistently going to be peer reviewed to ensure it is scientifically accurate. After this we can do trails and red tape before production.

You have to be admitted to have your t-cells removed from your body, it then takes a few weeks to expand and modify them before they can be infused back. (Long process, potential for issues from leukapheresis). 2. Once they\u2019re infused back there is a serious risk for cytokine release syndrome which can be fatal. All in all I think this treatment will ultimately be one of the first choices in the future but we need to work through the bugs and it would also be super helpful if we could use \u201coff the shelf\u201d T cells instead of borrowing from the patient. \n\nThe other articles seem to be incremental laboratory work which will be used to design other experiments which ultimately could drive new treatment options...as others have pointed out, while neat to read about and definitely important discoveries...the advances these things promise are almost always years away because it takes so long to bring a treatment from the bench to the clinic and then ultimately to the public.",

I work for a pharmaceutical company that makes cancer medicines and here is my take:\n\nOften when a new compound that has potential to treat cancer occurs, the discoverers start a new company and start researching. This can be done first in cultures cells in a test tube, then one or two animals that have been engineered genetically to get the kind of cancer the drug is made to target, then the human trials (clinical trials). \nSometimes the company falls apart, sometimes they runs out of something essential, money. Not enough people invested or the burn rate was to high. Sometimes there\u2019s mismanagement. \nLarge pharmaceutical companies will often acquire these companies at a hefty buy out at various stages of research and continue it onward. In some cases, further testing shows that the drug does not perform as well as existing drugs. Sometimes the side effects are too severe. \nIn one case I can recall, a drug worked too well, and killed the cancer so quickly it caused the spleen to explode if I remember correctly (too many dead cells to filter at once). Ones a drug I shown to be to risky for human use it\u2019s pretty much dead. \n\nJust my two cents.",

But, essentially, they post pop science stories like \"vitamin C cures cancer,\" then add the tag line \"... in mice.\"\n\nThe idea is to point out that the journalist in question took a study in mice and then wrote an article about this being true in humans *when none of the work to prove that has been done yet, and mice testing is simply one step needed to examine whether something works.*\n\nThe most pithy description of the issue comes from the medium article I linked above:\n\n&gt; Reporting pre-clinical research as something that\u2019s directly relevant to people in the here and now is like pointing at a pile of two-by-fours and a bag of tenpenny nails and calling it a cottage.\n\n[Here's an example](https://twitter.com/justsaysinmice/status/1260565875322748929).\n\nThe original article says:\n\n&gt; **In studies on mice**, researchers found that the combination delayed tumor progression in multiple mouse models of colorectal cancer; in some mice, it caused disease regression. The results were published in the journal Nature Communications.\n\n(my bold).\n\nThe title they ran it under said:\n\n&gt; A combo of fasting plus vitamin C is effective for hard-to-treat cancers, study shows\n\nSo of course that's misleading. Hence the tweeter added, \"in mice.\"\n\nI'm not saying that's always the case. But if you follow \"just says in mice\" for any length of time, you'll grow increasingly depressed how often mice research gets picked up with a headline that generalises it to humans as if no more research is needed.\n\nLet's take [your first story](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51182451) just as an example.\n\nThe headline was:\n\n&gt; Immune discovery 'may treat all cancer'\n\nThe article body says:\n\n&gt; However, the research has been tested only in animals and on cells in the laboratory, and more safety checks would be needed before human trials could start.\n\nand the scientist in question says:\n\n&gt; Daniel Davis, a professor of immunology at the University of Manchester, said: \"At the moment, this is very basic research and not close to actual medicines for patients.\n\nBut, unfortunately, \"some indications may be available for a new line of research but even if it works, it would need years of study to pay off\" doesn't make a good headline.",

            "comment": "1) Not per se. It all boils down to what the specific circumstances were for that particular drug and or treatment to be considered a \u201ccure\u201d. Many drugs work wonderfully against cancer and other devastating diseases when tested in cell culture or animal models, however, as soon as you try with humans they fail miserably. If the story is picked up before they do human trials they are essentially reporting a very promising drug that fizzles in humans. It is not possible to predict how well a new drug will work in humans; you need to do clinical trials in humans (tens of millions of USD and years).\n\nThe opposite is also true, there have been many cases when a drug showed no effect in animal trials but had significant effect in humans (thalidomide comes to mind). This is both good and bad. An older review about this can be found [here](https://www.bmj.com/content/334/7586/197?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=a8572afe2d36c799cfcb3b144f7484a5a207c74e-1591672027-0-AfUFHNdFdByNFJLvVE5KJmZUKqEbvFNUsfoHMFN4EvEwWAf4M3nfmVMV3wmztvwcAOjzq-3-UPSfhqq34WU8Nt25YgGZwcNLFoSIF3QIeys0gMMwtdWQosCeE-4XOEVBm9645YEbyWgm5rnbhokRnY4gyd3HF2nH2BsWYPscgo7wnnaTmgHatrhF-_STCNKSVusPfPdLuN2OBPlmJm2qCuBgA6vgH0CRZcf0uEIyX0X0mReKCzrtuTgxuhWxqPLzlD8D6xqN3fkD0eD5n9ZYqg6CfOgVKCbQoHw7E7VOpD5G) .\n\n\n2) As a simplified rule of thumb any study that is [blinded](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment) presents more accurate data than those that are not. This is a gross simplification, but one that makes life easier. Another indicator for the reliability of the results from a study is the stage of [drug development ](https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-drug-and-device-approvals/drug-development-process)  the study was conducted, e.g. if someone claims they cured a disease in animal models vs claim of stopping progression of disease in humans. If both studies were scientifically rigorous, then the human study has far superior value.\n\n3) Cancer itself. As was explained by others, there are many types of cancer. Each one is different and manifests differently in different patients. Some cancers can be grouped together by their disease development, location in the body, or effects; members of such groups may be susceptible to the same treatment, but different groups may not have any commonalities. In fact, there are treatments that work against one type of cancer but promote other types. Think of it like this (super simplified example): when you have a headache, drinking a glass of cold water often helps. If the headache is caused by anything other than slight dehydration, e.g. you bumping your head on the cabinet, drinking water will not help at all. Similarly, treating cancer requires that you know exactly what the cause is and how to treat that specific cause with a targeted drug. \n\nNow, having said that I have to mention that radiation works equally well on all cancers that are localized (non-metastatic) and that have clear physical representations. However, we seldom tolerate radiation therapy well since our healthy cells and tissue suffer as much damage as the cancerous cells and tissue.",

Each one is incredibly nuanced and difficult to answer in any sort of generalized manner. \n\n&gt;Is it exaggeration or misunderstanding on the part of the scientists about the drugs\u2019 effectiveness, or something else? It makes me skeptical about new developments and the validity of the media\u2019s excitement. It can seem as though the media is using people\u2019s hopes for a cure to get revenue.\n\nA lot of trials end up failing because the clinical trial pipeline is designed to test safety first, then efficacy, then effectiveness. What we care about in terms of curing cancer is effectiveness. So companies can spend years in the Phase I and II trials looking at safety and efficacy profiles and making sure that their drug passes through these phases. Phase III concerns effectiveness, which is a larger scale study in patients under scenarios more closely approximating the real world. Contrast this with efficacy, which is whether the drug works in a smaller population of patients under highly controlled conditions. Drugs can fail effectiveness trials and thus be worthless. \n\nScience in general is also about hyping up results. It's simply the culture. Once a scientist makes a discovery, it is to their benefit to hype it up because that's what generates additional funding and that's how you publish. Obviously pharmaceutical companies are less interested in academic publishing (although there has been a recent trend towards increased funding for this) but they still hype up their drugs. \n\n&gt;While I know there have been great strides in the past few decades, how can we discern what is legitimate and what is superficial when we see these stories?\n\nOnly time will tell. When people say something that sounds too good to be true (\"I've cured cancer!\") always take it with a grain of salt. If you do that, you'll never be disappointed. And statistically speaking, you'll be right most of the time. The only surefire way is to dig through the scientific data (which isn't always readily available) with a critical eye. \n\n&gt;What are the major hurdles to actually \u201ccuring\u201d cancer universally?\n\nThe issue is at the heart of what cancer is. Cancer is a disease of your own cells that start to grow in an uncontrolled manner. It's not a disease that you can acquire from other people (except for specific cases like HPV-caused cancers) and thus any therapy that kills cancer cells will almost inevitably kill your own cells. The idea behind most chemoradiation is to kill the cancer cells before the treatment kills you. More modern treatment options like many of the immunotherapies target markers that are only expressed by cancer cells so they reduce the non-specific targeting of your own, healthy cells. These therapies are still being developed and refined and so far, haven't yielded a universal cure.",

Take PD-1 inhibitors for example: the first published papers on PD-1 inhibitors for cancer date back to 2001. The first clinically approved PD-1 inhibitor was approved in 2014.\n\nYou may see a news story about a cancer being cured in a petri dish somewhere, but you would have to wait over 10 years to find out if it can actually make it to the clinic.",

Many do get to market though and there are breakthrough drugs every year that have continued to change the paradigm of cancer treatment and increase survival. Phase 3 trials and on market drugs are usually for very specific indications and often nuanced efficacy improvements like \"increases progression free survival of metastatic colon cancer after failure of first round of therapy over typical second line treatments\", which is not as flashy for pop media as \"amazing new treatment for colon cancer!\"",

These therapies was approved by the FDA (and has been approved in many European countries since) in 2017-2018 with the names Kymriah and Yescarta. There is several reasons it's not used in plenty. The cost of one treatment is ~300000$. And it is usually \"last line defense\", after other treatments have failed.\n\nThe reason it's so expensive is every \"batch\" has to be tailored using the patients own T-cells. So you can't just make a bunch and keep it on ice/storage. \n\nResearch is being made into making CAR-T-cells that anyone can take.",

The \"early years\" (which are actually up until the 1980's) are actually rather gruesome. But what this documentary well illustrated IMHO was the \"russian dolls\" nature of cancer(s). Every single time one major breakthrough was found, from the first chemotherapies to the most recent immunology-based ones, while it did cure some cases it mostly uncovered how complicated the disease can be.\n\nOne particular part I remember is when genetic sequencing was first used on some cancerous cells. The first result was \"yay, we found one gene that is defective in tumor cells, we're much closer to a cure!\". And then when more tumors from other types of cancer were also sequenced, it appeared that for these it wasn't just one gene, but two, 10, or even 50.",

A key part of this success if the cooperation, sharing of results and uses of protocols.

            "comment": "So there are a lot of factors that go into this the main two I see are this. The level of understanding of journalists and translation from in vitro (in a test tube) to in vivo (in an animal model).\n\nMost journalists sensationalize results either one for more views/clicks or purely out of scientific ignorance. In a lot of cases they have no more science background than your average college graduate. There\u2019s also the invitation of research bias when they interview lead researchers. Researchers of course will be very proud of any breakthrough because it generally takes years of work and a little luck. This can lead to some exaggeration from excitement when they speak on a more personal level.\n\nThe difference between in vitro and in vivo can be massive, especially working with cancer cells that are already working differently than healthy cells. Whatever fueled the breakthrough whether chemical drug, protein manipulation, or immune modification could potentially still be toxic even deadly on an organism level. There\u2019s also the possibility that the breakthrough simply won\u2019t do anything at the organism level due to metabolism and clearance of the product before it can make any meaningful physiological difference. Finally we come to funding and time. Millions of dollars and several years most likely went into the in vitro studies, it will take millions more and hopefully a little less time(still years though)to get through in vivo studies, and then millions more and at least 5 years to get to actual drug trials. In a perfect world those funding hurdles wouldn\u2019t matter, but that\u2019s not where we live.",

Because funding. Even if grant reviewers don't buy the sensationalized media, the people influencing that grant money availability - like congress or their constituents - *will*  be affected by the media. I believe it's better to cast the results in a positive light so the larger community can benefit for (a) continuing and expanding research funds and (b) so that 0.00001% chance of a treatment making it to FDA-approval improves that much more - not because of poor regulation but because of good science, good statistics, and good compatibility with existing treatments.",

People like to throw the \"companies don't want to find a cure because it stops revenue\" argument when trying to discourage medical research companies but another thing they seem to omit is that sometimes it's just not worth the fallout when compared to the success rate. \n\nIve seen case studies where a new treatment is made available to a select few patients but the results aren't up to the standards that the developing company was expecting. For example 30% of patients recovered while 70% of patients did not, and in those 70% variables that are generally not seen with the underlying illness were present. \n\nSo yes, 30% survived but the risk of having to fight those who did not is not worth the hassle.",

They are a revenue based business like any other business in America. While they try to attempt integrity with their reporting, they almost always carry some sort of bias, either towards a view that will attract specific audiences (MSNBC, Fox News towards their respected demographics for example) or they will try to sensationalize or use other tactics to get you to click. So maybe what actually happened in the world is a minor-breakthrough but a news media might sensationalize it to get you to click and read the article... because that's what's good for THEIR revenue even if they are slightly misinforming you of the bigger facts.\n\nJust a perspective. Not the end-all-be-all of this debate, but I think what I stated about Media defiantly holds true for a lot of things.",

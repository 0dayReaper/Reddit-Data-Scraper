You perceive time subjectively at all times but, an organism that processes thing faster would consider their perception of time to be normal even if you might consider the equivalent to be slowed down. You can actually change your perception of time in a lot of ways, my personal favorite: watch YouTube videos on double speed for a few hours than try talking to someone, you will feel slower and like they are slower than usual. (I do this unintentionally all of the time)",

It means there is no proof of a spectrum on time perception.\n\nHowever, we have biological clocks. The day/night cycle is often perceived even in a closed room for a few days after being locked in.\n\nIf our brains work with neurones as our computer do, the number of hormonal cycles, chemical reaction and/or \"thoughts\" could be the brain's interpretation of time. Hence it is very much personal and can be altered in many ways: alcohol, drugs, a good conversation or a slow lecture.\n\nIf you ever felt that time passed by fast during a good discussion, it may be just because the number of thoughts transmitted during that time is really low (your brain measured less time than what passed). On the other hand, a lecture with a lot to take in during the same amount of time would seem really slow because the number of transmission is big (your brain measured a lot more time than what actually passed).\n\nAll of this is just conjectures, it is not scientifically proven to my knowledge.",

Then pay more attention to your surroundings. I think you're onto something here. This would explain why time seemed to go much slower as kids and why kids has such an easy time learning new things.",

The perception of time does not seem to be related to the number of computational activities going on. That very dense lecture can seem very slow if you're struggling to understand and not interested, or very fast if you're really excited by the ideas and thinking hard about them and have a lot of thoughts wuzzing through your head. \n\nTime perception is certainly not my area of expertise, though I am a neuroscientist. To my knowledge the issue of differences in the perceived length of time, if something seems slower fast, is poorly understood at best.",

It's why things feel like they're moving slower on a 240hz monitor vs a 60hz.\n\nThe neurochemical reaction of how we learn and remember is also stronger during these times.  The combo of this and perceived time dilation is why PTSD is an absolute horror to deal with.",

I do not think it is just about processing speed, but more like our perception of colour or smell, our perception of time is a calibrated part of our conscious experience, one that is probably optimized for better functioning in specific situations. In emergency situations especially there can be a sense of time dramatically slowing down.",

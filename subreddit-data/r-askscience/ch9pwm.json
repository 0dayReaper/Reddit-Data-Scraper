            "comment": "Most of the major points regarding refeeding syndrome and hyponatremia have already been covered in this thread. So I'd like to point out a different issue with severe dehydration. As the body becomes increasingly dehydrated, it becomes increasingly difficult to actually get water in. \n\nThis is especially true when you consider one of the most common causes of dehydration is fluid loss due to GI illness. (vomiting and diarrhea). This is even doubly so with infants. It's not possible to rehydrate simply by drinking. You cause more vomiting, more loss, and risk aspirating and drowning. And with dehydration comes hypovolemia. There's so little volume of blood in your veins that they are virtually impossible to start an IV without blowing the vessel. \n\nThe most extreme treatment for this is [Intraosseous Infusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intraosseous_infusion) , where fluids are injected directly into the bone marrow. In laymen terms, we jam a straw into your shin and pour saline/meds/etc.\n\nThere isn't really a point of no return on life, so long as you're still alive. But that's not to say you won't have lasting ill effects. Lifelong dialysis due to kidney failure is a bitch.",

To avoid this they are initially fed with specialised therapeutic feeds called F75 and then later F100 as the child improves. The numbers refer to the number of calories in the feed. The quantity of the feed given is also controlled carefully, starting with a small amount and gradually increasing as the weight of the child improves. Many times several weeks of hospital care is required for these children. These feeds correct the electrolyte imbalances associated with refeeding.\n\nAs for dehydration, a dehydrated malnourished child is very difficult to rehydrate. IV rehydration is very risky and can be fatal. It is reserved for cases in shock. What is used is a solution called Resomal (rehydration solution for malnutrition). If the child is not able to take the solution orally, it is given via nasogastric tube.",

And that is just one of many mechanisms, you could have issues with production of digestive enzymes, bile, stomach acid, etc, which can stop or slow down absorption.\n\nAnother way to look at it, though, is this; if you have a person dying of starvation (or rather, massive organ failure, because of a lack of nutrients), who just died, but their cells are mostly still alive, if you pour food and water down their throats, do they come back to life? Of course not. It's just a question of what fails and how, and that point of no return is probably highly variable, and perhaps subject to what sort of medical care a person can get.",

Too little potassium suddenly in the blood causes major problems to muscle and brain tissues. Some tap water has more potassium than others, so it depends. The other problem with tap water is that it has different amounts of calcium, magnesium, fluoride, and other salts. This affects the osmotic gradient.

            "comment": "I did my senior thesis on the physiology of the Refeeding Syndrome, so I can definitely answer about starving, but not  so much about thirst. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Refeeding Syndrome is when someone who has been fasting for a long time gets food, and this causes their body to experience a massive shift in ion balance that makes a bad situation (low ion levels from depletion during fasting) much, much worse. Most notably, phosphates are depleted from the serum, meaning the bajillion physiological pathways that rely on phosphates all shut down. There are all the other ions that are probably out of balance too, and need to be fixed, but they only cause relatively mild problems that can be dealt with later. Hypophosphataemia (low phosphate concentration) is going to be the one that kills you. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYour body is slowly losing electrolytes (importantly: phosphates) all the time, but these are replaced by electrolytes in food and drink. When fasting, the electrolytes aren't being replenished. When you eat, insulin is released, which tells cells to start glycolysis and make energy. Energy must be used in order to make more energy, and phosphates are also needed to make energy. So, insulin also tells cells to take phosphates out of the serum, and to start using energy to make more energy. The problem is, there isn't much energy or phosphate to be used/taken out of the blood, and both are required for pretty much every process that is critical to keeping you alive. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnother issue with refeeding has to do with your stomach and intestines. During fasting, the absorptive mucosa of your gastrointestinal system is downregulated. Since it isn't being used, the body allocates less resources to it, and it shrinks and becomes less effective at absorbing nutrients. Also, the gastrointestinal system houses gut bacteria that help you break down your food and use its energy and nutrients. When you fast, these bacteria are starved. While they probably wont die out completely, their numbers will be greatly reduced. All of this means that you also are going to be less good at using the food that you eat.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe solution is to manage the phosphate and other ion levels first, then slowly start to feed so that you don't make huge insulin spikes. It's better to starve for a few more days, which you'll probably survive, than to feed you right away and trigger acute hypophosphataemia that will cause tons of other problems that have a good chance of killing you. Current treatments suggest beginning with electrolyte fluids and no calories, and then feeding 25%, then 50%, then 75%, then 100% RER (resting energy requirement, the energy you use just sitting there doing nothing) over the course of 1-2 weeks. Some studies recommend giving IV phosphate supplements too. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: My background is veterinary. While I did do some research into refeeding syndrome with humans, most of my knowledge is in regards to other animals, mostly cats and dogs.",

The general rule of thumb was if they weighed less than 40 kilograms they were unlikely to survive.",

Their willpower keeps the body going (placebo effect) until help can intervene.

            "comment": "This may not pertain EXACTLY to what you are asking but once someone reaches a certain point of starvation/hydration the introduction of nutrition can actually have a detrimental &amp; potentially fatal effect.\n\nThis is known as \"Refeeding Syndrome\"\n\nBelow is an excerpt from the wikipedia page:\n\n&gt;Any individual who has had a negligible nutrient intake for many consecutive days and/or is metabolically stressed from a critical illness or major surgery is at risk of refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome usually occurs within four days of starting to re-feed. Patients can develop fluid and\u00a0electrolyte\u00a0disorders, especially\u00a0hypophosphatemia, along with neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, and hematologic complications.\n\n&gt;During\u00a0fasting\u00a0the body switches its main fuel source from carbohydrates to fat tissue\u00a0fatty acids\u00a0and\u00a0amino acids\u00a0as the main energy sources. The spleen decreases its rate of red blood cell breakdown thus conserving\u00a0red blood cells. Many intracellular minerals become severely depleted during this period, although serum levels remain normal. Importantly,\u00a0insulin\u00a0secretion is suppressed in this fasted state and\u00a0glucagon\u00a0secretion is increased.[2]\n&gt;During refeeding, insulin secretion resumes in response to increased\u00a0blood sugar, resulting in increased glycogen, fat and protein synthesis. This process requires\u00a0phosphates,\u00a0magnesium\u00a0and\u00a0potassium\u00a0which are already depleted and the stores rapidly become used up. Formation of phosphorylated carbohydrate compounds in the liver and skeletal muscle depletes intracellular\u00a0ATP\u00a0and\u00a02,3-diphosphoglycerate\u00a0in\u00a0red blood cells, leading to cellular dysfunction and inadequate oxygen delivery to the body's organs. Refeeding increases the\u00a0basal metabolic rate. Intracellular movement of electrolytes occurs along with a fall in the\u00a0serum\u00a0electrolytes, including\u00a0phosphorus\u00a0and\u00a0magnesium. Levels of serum glucose may rise and the B1\u00a0vitamin\u00a0thiamine\u00a0may fall.\u00a0Abnormal heart rhythmsare the most common cause of death from refeeding syndrome, with other significant risks including confusion,\u00a0coma\u00a0and convulsions and\u00a0cardiac failure.\n\n&gt;This syndrome can occur at the beginning of treatment for\u00a0anorexia nervosa\u00a0when patients have an increase in calorie intake and can be fatal.[4]\u00a0It can also occur after the onset of a severe illness or major surgery. The shifting of electrolytes and fluid balance increases cardiac workload and heart rate. This can lead to acute heart failure. Oxygen consumption is also increased which strains the respiratory system and can make weaning from ventilation more difficult.\n\nTL;DR - The body attempts to conserve energy by rationing nutritional reserves and focusing on slow burning calories such as Fat as opposed to carbohydrates. Once the body is in this nutritional hibernation if various nutrients are consumed/added too quickly the body can't digest/metabolize them and overloads.\n\nThink of your computer running on battery saver and you suddenly open hundreds of applications at once.",

That's why it's helpful to moisten their mouths with ice chips or a sponge.\n\nI don't think that's directly because of dehydration, but because of the overall terminal condition. But I suppose if the person was that close to death, the initial cause is kind of irrelevant at that point.\n\nThe people I was with were not fully conscious at that point, but could become agitated/distressed. It's not easy to tell what people perceive in that state. The nurses &amp; hospice experts told me they were only reacting to internal sensations like difficulty breathing, not responding to outside stimuli like being spoken to. But it's a bit mysterious.",

Among people who dry fast (no food or water), it's not uncommon for people to go 5-7 days without adverse effects.\n\nThe body can create water from burning fat and breathing air. From what I've read, 100 grams of fat can be made into 107 grams of water (where the hydrogen from the fat particles are combined with oxygen from the air to create H2O).\n\nSo as long as a person has enough fat, and they don't lose too much water to sweat and respiration - they can probably go quite a long time without food or water.\n\nBears don't drink during hibernation. And trans-ocean migratory birds don't drink when they are flying hundreds or thousands of miles over sea water.",

Pretty much all the way up until the point that your digestive system permanently shuts down, you can recover. However, you can get to that \"point of no return\" if you eat too fast. When you eat something, your body needs to spend a little energy to extract the energy and nutrients in the food. When you are starving, you don't have enough energy and nutrient reserves to digest the food. Digestion is an autonomic process, so there isn't much anyone can do do stop it. Your digestive system will increase your heart rate and draw out nutrients from your blood. When starving, this is all that's left. Your vital organs have nothing left to sustain themselves and shut down. \n\nTo summarize, that point of no return is when the first morsel of food goes down your throat.",

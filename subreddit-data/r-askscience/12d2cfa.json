    "postText": "If you look at the NASA images of the Human Landing System for the Artemis mission, the solar panels are not a uniform color (like those on a house), but have some bright parts an some dark parts. It doesn't look like there is a pattern, but it's part of the material. Why not have a uniform material for the solar panels?\n\n[https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/](https://www.nasa.gov/specials/artemis/)",

It was produced by NASA to serve as a design reference for the subsequent commercial HLS proposals.",

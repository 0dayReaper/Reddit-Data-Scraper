            "comment": "Canadian checking in here. \n\n**This comment has been updated with better info and links for the sake of clarity, see below for new info**\n\nOriginal Comment:\n\n&gt;As far as I can tell from my research into how this affects Canada, there is only one undersea fiber cable linking Canada's internet to the rest of the world that doesnt go through the US first. That link goes to Greenland and reportedly has had frequent issues since it was built due to poor construction. Aside from this Greenland link, all other wired Canadian internet traffic goes through the US first before going to the rest of the world. The US could effectively cut Canada off from the internet if it wanted to.\n\n&gt;However, there is a proposal to built a new, modern fiber link through the Canadian arctic that would link London, UK with Tokyo, Japan. This would significantly reduce latency between Western Europe and East Asia while also bypassing the mainland US. It would also provide gigabit internet access to thousands of remote Inuit communities in the Canadian Arctic, which could have life changing effects on their economies.\n\n**UPDATES**\n\nThanks to /u/RcNorth and /u/markszpak for highlighting [this more detailed map](https://www.submarinecablemap.com/#/submarine-cable/gtt-atlantic) than the ones I based the previous version of this comment on. This more detailed map clearly shows that there are 3 fiber links from Halifax to the UK in addition to a fiber link up to Greenland that I mentioned previously.\n\nHowever as described by /u/SoontobeSam:\n\n&gt;As a former network operations technician for a Canadian ISP, this is correct, telegreenland's cable is the only subsea fiber I am aware of that does not enter the US before Canada, our other main access routes are in Toronto and Vancouver, but both connect to the US to access international networks.\nI can also confirm that their network uptime is mostly ok, but when they do have issues it takes forever to get any progress and dealing with ongoing non outage issues is difficult, also Newfies and Scots have a serious language barrier even though they're both speaking \"English\".\n\nSo while my initial remarks regarding the US basically being the gatekeeper for Canada's access to the wider Internet may be more or less correct, I was incorrect in saying that the Greenland fiber link is the ONLY fiber link Canada has to the rest of the world. While the Toronto, Halifax, and Vancouver links /u/SoontobeSam mentioned appear to all go through the US in some way first which technically restricts Canada's direct access through those links.\n\n**Arctic Fiber**\n\nBy popular request here is [the link to the site](http://qexpressnet.com/system/) for the fiber link through the Canadian Arctic that I mentioned previously. The project was formerly known as Arctic Fiber, but has been re-branded as the Quintillion Cable System after the name of the company task with installing the cable. Yes, you read that right, this project has gotten the green light since I last checked up on it (I didn't have time to check on my way to work when I commented originally). They just completed Phase 1 which covers Alaska, and will be starting the Phase 2 to expand through Asia to Tokyo soon. Quintillion has also built a terrestrial link through Alaska and down to the mainland US in order to provide connection to existing connection hubs on the west coast.\n\n*UPDATE 2: Just have to highlight these two awesome users comments:*\n\nUser /u/KrazyTrumpeter05 posted [an awesome comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7ez85x/with_all_this_fuss_about_net_neutrality_exactly/dq9ir7v/) with more info about Canadian Fiber connections, and also linked to [this 293 report](http://subtelforum.com/products/submarine-cable-almanac/) they claim to have played a major role in writing about Internet Fiber connections around the world. Thanks for the fascinating info!\n\nUser /u/Fochang1 posted [this fascinating comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7ez85x/with_all_this_fuss_about_net_neutrality_exactly/dq9ic13/) about how South American/Caribbean nations have a similar issue with the US acting as their Internet gatekeepers. They linked to [this insane Internet Exchange Point](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAP_of_the_Americas) in Miami that routes most of South/Central America's internet traffic. Thanks for sharing this incredible perspective that Canadians like myself would otherwise be oblivious to!\n\n**Some thoughts on the impact of Arctic Fiber**\nThe fact that this project is actually being built is incredible, because it will mean a huge boost in connection for remote arctic communities that open up massive new economic and information exchange opportunities to these historically very isolated regions. I can't wait to see what the Inuit peoples of Canada's arctic will do with this new link to the outside world. Reconciliation between Canada's indigenous and non-indigenous peoples has become a major focus for Canada in recent years, with the Canadian government [set to fully implement into law](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wilson-raybould-backs-undrip-bill-1.4412037) a 2007 [UN declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples](https://www.un.org/development/desa/indigenouspeoples/declaration-on-the-rights-of-indigenous-peoples.html). There is a long way to go for reconciliation, and it has been a very rocky road so far, but I hope that this new Fiber link will open up new ways for a large portion of Canada's indigenous population to showcase their own culture to the world and make new economic opportunities for their communities in the digital marketplace.\n\nIf you for some reason read through everything to this point, thanks for reading :)",

If this Net Neutrality stuff is repealed, and valve doesn't pay up then all steam server access will be significantly slowed.\n\nBottom line is internet is a network of sub-networks. These sub-networks are owned by ISPs and they make deals to allow one another to route packets through their cables. If this net neutrality stuff is repealed, although the rest of the routing around the world wouldn't be effected much, any routing via the US, or from the US will be subject to the bandwidth limits set by their ISPs.\n\nThink of it as a pipe it doesn't matter how large the pipes are, if there is one section of the pipe that is really small then that is the limiter of the throughput of the entire system.

Look at the Netflix issue from a couple years ago. They basically ransomed the customers' connection to Netflix for a chunk of their profit. They could have just as easily said no and choked them off to the point where they lost all those customers. Subscriptions were involved so there was money to be made. In anything with a paying customer involved the fee, in a similar situation anyway, would be passed on to the consumer on the services side. What if they had decided to do this to a service that doesn't have subscriptions? What's going to stop them from double dipping and charging the service and the customer for access to the service?",

In some countries, different networks within the same country won't exchange traffic directly. So instead, they send the traffic to the US where they exchange traffic with a US network. The US network (usually in Miami) then passes the traffic to the other network and its sent back to that country. So in effect, a lot of local traffic in Latin American and Caribbean countries ends up being sent to the United States and back as a \"normal\" traffic pattern. \n\nThis is getting a little bit better. In the last few years, some countries in the region have started putting in Internet exchange points (IXPs) where multiple networks can peer and exchange traffic within the country. If you have your local network operators exchanging local traffic in country at an IXP, it can cut down significantly on costs, latency, and also the local traffic isn't usually leaving and passing through a third party network (who may manage the traffic differently). Also, it makes the global and local networks far more robust. If your only undersea cable to Miami gets cut, you can at least still send local traffic. \n\nAlso, the data center where a lot of Latin American and Caribbean traffic is exchanged in Miami is built to handle strong hurricanes. Its called the NAP of the Americas and it looks like a fortress: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAP_of_the_Americas \n\nAlso, here's a pretty quick read about IXPs: https://www.internetsociety.org/policybriefs/ixps/ \n",

I just love the accents and would be so happy to be connected to an old Inuit woman every time I had a problem.  \n",

They currently have a monopoly on low-cost reusable rockets, and this reusability opens up new venues that weren't previously available. They only reuse first stage right now, but their next rocket, BFR, is going to be designed with full reusability which would make the marginal cost to only be the satellite (which they are claiming is going to cheap), fuel (methane), and maintenance.\n\nWhen SpaceX first started to do reusability rockets it may have seemed pointless, as space launches were infrequent, but what that did was opening up completely new uses for satellites that would otherwise have been too costly to be practical.",

That's why SpaceX is still looking for ways to cut costs even more.\n\nOn the satellite side, most satellites are massively overbuilt, since launch costs are so much.  If a launch doesn't cost as much, and the satellite only has a few years worth of designed lifetime, there's no reason to overbuild, and raise costs to stupid levels.\n\nOn the launcher side, expanding re-usability and turn around time means they can put more satellites in orbit for less money.  The fact it's LEO instead of GTO means they can put up several satellites on a single launch, and recovery is much easier.\n\n&gt; GPS satellites have to be replaced quite often and they are much smaller than data transfer satellites AFAIK.\n\nThe first [GPS satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_satellite_blocks) had a 7.5 year design life, and lasted almost 17 years.  Also, later satellites might not have been strictly needed, but they added more GPS signals for more robust/accurate location information.  Plus, the newer ones allow the US to selectively turn GPS off over certain parts of the planet.  They might not be in geostationary orbit, but they're much higher than you think they are.  ISS is at 400km, and GPS satellites are at 20,000km.\n\nI can't find a good mass for communication satellites, but I suspect that several of them can be carried by a single Falcon 9.  So, there won't be as many launches as you think.",

You dont pay for, lets say, a 300/50 connection for your block of servers, you buy what basically amounts to a data pipe and they charge you based on how you use it. So if you have a theoretical 100gbps line out, but you never use it, it doesnt cost \"much\", but if you fully saturate it 24/7 thats when it gets expensive. The pricing is entirely based on average throughput, not a metering of how much data you actually sent. So if you occasionally burst 100gbps for 5 seconds, but otherwise average out to 10gbps through the billiing cycle, thats what they charge you for (plus the base cost of the line). \"Throttling\" your connection would be counterintuitive because they would just end up charging you less, and theyre also not providing you the service youre paying for. And at the prices they charge, someone in the legal department will have a real problem with that. \n\nIn short, network neutrality in the united states means nothing to someone who doesnt live in the united states, the services you want to access hosted in US data centers will continue to operate as expected for you. Its only a problem if youre using a consumer ISP or if you want to use a service or view content someone is hosting on their consumer ISP, which is pretty rare. ",

Also check [here](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/us-population/) and [here](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/europe-population/). You can see the percentages of households with a computer and internet access is in both around 70% - 80%, just pick 75% for ease of calculation, US having 330mln citizens and EU having 750 mln, that means that there are at least, respectively, 250 mln US citizens with access to internet, and in EU 560 mln. To achieve the best internet experience the datacenters for all big companies that everyone uses are spread across the world, with the concentration of datacenters being proportional to the traffic. Knowing EU has twice as many internet users as US, logically there should be, and probably are - more datacenters in EU than in US. This means that impact on EU will be low but it can lead to other unforeseen consequences outside of \"just the internet\". Same counts for other regions like Canada, South America, Asia, Australia (they have shit internet anyways) and Africa. Biggest impact (in order) I expect this to have is: Canada, EU, South America, Asia, Australia, Africa. Look for example how IBMs datacenters are [spread around the world](https://prnewswire2-a.akamaihd.net/p/1893751/sp/189375100/thumbnail/entry_id/1_ny63t7c4/def_height/2700/def_width/2700/version/100011/type/1?.jpg). Other big companies probably have the same spread. This would confirm which regions of the world would be fucked most by US net neutrality laws being repealed. Also check out [Azure's datacenters spread](http://africatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/microsoft-804x452.jpg) and [Google's datacenters spread](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2345/2404505335_9f06ed86ac_o.jpg). \n\n[Here](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/complete-white-paper-c11-481360.html) you can see US will account for \"only\" (still a big chunk though) 30% of the worlds internet traffic in 2021 (maybe that will change with the laws repealed though). But there's still the 70% of traffic outside US.\n\n[Worldwide](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS) 45% of the population has internet access one way or another (for 7 bln people that makes 3.15 bln). Of those 3.15 bln users, US counts for 250 mln, or just shy of 8% of the worlds internet population. This means other internet traffic is generated by 92% of the rest population in the world.\n\nSo, as of now the 8% of internet worldwide internet population located in US generates 30% of the internet traffic while 92% of the world generates 70% of the traffic.. well good for Americans I guess, that will make the impact a bit heavier on the rest of the world?..\n\nAs for other unforeseen consequences, think of intercontinental shipping, they need to send data between them to coordinate stuff, slow it down and it could mean your shipping container gets delayed by a week? Maybe this is an exaggeration but who knows..",

It's also much more expensive to buy bandwidth in Asia vs. the US so unless your application has low latency requirements you're probably hosting on the west coast of the US.",

                            "comment": "Not really, data shouldn't unnecessarily pass through US servers, it would be very bad design. You always try to distribute your content around the world and get copies of it close to the so-called eyeball networks, which are those where you have a lot of end users.\n\nThere are caching servers that are installed in ISPs networks directly like [Netflix Open Connect](https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/), [SteamPipe](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamPipe) and there is one for YouTube but I can't find public info right now.\n\nOr if you can't get ISPs to cache your content, because you are not important enough, then you hire a content delivery network (CDN) like Akamai, Cloudflare or Limelight, who have fast connections to literally thousands of small ISPs and host your stuff all over the world.\n\nA third option is hiring servers to run your applications at Amazon or Microsoft, who have datacenters all over the world. That would of course also provide some locality.\n\nThe thing is, you do this because sending traffic around the world, beyond the reach of your own network, usually means paying a Tier-1 ISP, those are the two handful of really large ones (Level 3, Congent, AT&amp;T, Sprint, Verizon, Deutsche Telekom, Telia, Tata, NTT, Telecom Italia, KPN, Liberty, and Orange) who can deliver traffic to any IP address without having to buy access from anyone else. Those are billing you per volume of data, so you try to minimize that, by improving locality in any way you can, caching, CDN, local servers, or peering with other \"small-fry\" tier-2 ISP. Of those peering doesn't help if you want to cross an ocean.\n\nIn addition to the cost there is also latency. The speed of light in fiber-optics is reduced to about 2/3 of the vacuum, so that means it takes 5000km / 200'000km/s = 25ms for the pure distance over the Atlantic alone and then all the signal repeaters and routers on the way add their bit. From my experience a signal across the Atlantic and back takes at least 100ms, so for interactive real time applications you already start suffering consequences.\n\nSo it should be safe to say that _passing trough_ should be very limited except for maybe Middle American countries who use your transatlantic and transpacific infrastructure.\n\nHowever there is of course significant data exchange happening where entities in North America want to communicate with entities in Europe and entities in Asia and vice-versa. What I can find right now it seems to have been [15 TB/s with Europe and 10 TB/s with Asia in 2015](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/internet-transatlantic-data-flows-version-2.pdf) but there is no mention if it's particularly one sided. It just says in 2012 the market value of the digital online services exchanged was about 3:4 in the US benefit vs the EU, so maybe the data is split the same way.\n\nAbout sources: I can't individually source a lot of this very general knowledge on internet architecture, but a lot of what I know stems from the The Internet Peering Playbook by William B. Norton. Everyone who has to do with Internet Architecture knows the Playbook. The rest is from my professor Timothy Roscoe in his Internet Architecture and Policy seminary.",

The established web players and paper maps paid to not let that get off the ground.\n\nImagine no games like League of Legends because major ISPs in the biggest market block them (they already did that to League of Legends before Obama's net neutrality rules).\n\nImagine you like a game - Minecraft - but the major ISP builds their own knockoff, PixelMine, and blocks/slows Minecraft to the point it doesn't succeed and/or you give up.\n\nIt's not even hypothetical, they've done it before. Examples of just some of the stuff which the FCC had to clamp down on over the past decade for breaking Net Neutrality, before Obama got in and codified the rules:\n\n&gt; 2005 - Madison River Communications was blocking VOIP services. The FCC put a stop to it.\n\n&gt; 2005 - Comcast was denying access to p2p services without notifying customers.\n\n&gt; 2007-2009 - AT&amp;T was having Skype and other VOIPs blocked because they didn't like there was competition for their cellphones.\n\n&gt; 2011 - MetroPCS tried to block all streaming except youtube. (edit: they actually sued the FCC over this)\n\n&gt; 2011-2013, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and Verizon were blocking access to Google Wallet because it competed with their bullshit. edit: this one happened literally months after the trio were busted collaborating with Google to block apps from the android marketplace\n\n&gt; 2012, Verizon was demanding google block tethering apps on android because it let owners avoid their $20 tethering fee. This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do that as part of a winning bid on an airwaves auction. (edit: they were fined $1.25million over this)\n\n&gt; 2012, AT&amp;T - tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money.\n\n&gt; 2013, Verizon literally stated that the only thing stopping them from favoring some content providers over other providers were the net neutrality rules in place.\n\nAnd:\n\n&gt; 2007(?)-2009: Verizon Wireless blocks access to the device GPS and therefore all third party PalmOS and Windows Mobile mapping/navigation apps and forces users to use their slow, unstable, inaccurate (potentially dangerous) VZNavigator... for an extra $20 a month.",

We think the separation we have between network owners (like Chorus and local fibre networks) and Internet Service Providers that sell you Internet access, protects us against the majority of net neutrality issues. However, we are keeping an eye on the Internet Service Provider and wholesale markets to make sure we don't end up with a net neutrality problem.\n\nOur ISPs are the same people that own the lines. Its impractical to lay 17 different lines over the last mile and we decided to build out via giving a handful of companies huge tax breaks worth hundreds of millions over the years.\n\nWhile I really like the NZ solution its laughably off the table.  The choice isn't between having a functional NZ like internet and using the FCC to enforce network neutrality.\n\nThe choice is the already horribly dysfunctional internet we have and one that is even more so.",

    "postText": "These chemicals in your blood may cause autism (#7 will surprise you!)\n\nIf you are in the USA, there is a 70-80% chance you have pyrethroid pesticide metabolites in your blood right now. If you have a can of bug spray, they are likely in it. If someone sprays for insects in your apartment or home, this is likely what they are spraying. If you are in an area where they fog for mosquitoes, this is what they are spraying. It is used in landscaping in public green spaces and businesses. These pesticides are everywhere - and for good reason. They are considered completely safe for adults.\n\nAnd yet, multiple recent studies have shown that exposure to pyrethroid class pesticides during pregnancy, or even just having them used within a mile of your house, is a risk factor for autism and neurodevelopmental disorders in the unborn child.\n\nIn my research, published today in the journal PNAS Nexus, we exposed three separate cohorts of pregnant mice to a \"safe\" low dose of the pyrethroid deltamethrin during pregnancy and lactation, then we examined the offspring. All three cohorts of offspring had hyperactivity, reduced vocalizations, increased repetitive behaviors, failed basic learning tests, and had wide ranging disruptions in the dopamine system in the brain. All symptoms which, in humans, are related to autism and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nI am happy to answer all your questions! I will be on today at 12pm US EST (16 UT) until at least 5pm (21 UT).

One of the best examples of this is the [CHARGE study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4181917/), which looked at 970 families in California and correlated the incidence of autism and developmental delay in the children with geographical data on pesticide use near their home during the mother's pregnancy. That study found that pesticide use within 1.5 km (\\~1 mile) of the home during pregnancy was a risk factor for autism and DD in the child.\n\nAs u/kompooter mentioned, the results of the CHARGE study are similar to results from [Hicks et al 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5443159/), [Ehrenstein et al 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6425996/) and others.\n\nThe strength of careful epidemiology is in their ability to identify risk factors at the population level. However, risk factors are not necessarily causes. Well-designed basic research is critically important in determining whether a risk factor may be a cause.",

                    "comment": "Great questions. With regard to proposed mechanism, in the exposed mice at least, there are changes in the dopamine system in the brain in adulthood which likely started with the exposure in utero or early in life. We see changes in the pups' vocalization frequency as early as 6-7 days of age. The dopamine system is by no means the only thing changed in the brain - it is simply the one that we looked for. Not to get too much into unpublished data, but there are almost certainly other mechanisms throughout the brain that have been disrupted by the developmental exposure.\n\nWith regard to metabolites in the blood, that work was done by the CDC as part of their NHANES database, where they collect blood samples and clinical data from the general population every year and make the results available to researchers. [Two](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4458051/) [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4415012/) on the NHANES database showed 70-80% of the samples had detectable 3-phenoxybenzoic acid, a pyrethroid metabolite. The fact that the (type I) pyrethroids are metabolized so quickly, and yet are so pervasive in general population blood samples, suggests that our exposures are not acute by nature. We are likely being exposed and re-exposed all the time.\n\nThere is evidence that both type I and type II pyrethroid metabolites cross the placental and blood-brain barrier, and can also be found in breast milk. However, whether these cross in sufficient quantities to directly cause changes in the brain/fetus (or instead have indirect effects, through the mother's metabolism/immune system for instance) is still unknown.",

We are currently performing these same experiments using prairie voles, a rodent species indigenous to the Midwest which we breed in the lab from wild-caught stock. I don't want to go too much into unpublished results, but we seem to have very similar findings in these wild animals.\n\nAs far as I know, there are no other natural sources of 3-PBA. It is used as a marker for pyrethroid metabolism in many studies, including the CDC's NHANES database of human samples.\n\nRegarding dose, we used one that I would call intermediate - below the EPA's benchmark \"safe\" dose, but above what is considered an \"average\" human exposure level. The careful dose work to determine the limits of these effects is forthcoming.",

Both papers are introduced with literature reviews listing papers that test links for specific pesticides to specific symptoms/disorders with various methods, if interested in further reading. \n\nHuman surveys are done in California because it's the state that most comprehensively locally reports pesticide use. Despite pesticides being found in some amount everywhere, there is going to be a minimum exposure level at which risk becomes statistically significant. For now the studies I glanced at seem to be recommending caution for pregnant women whose home gardens use pesticides or who live within 1 km or so of farms. \n\n(Apparently -- I don't know any of this, I'm just reading what's said in the intro and conclusion on these papers.)",

In the beginning, we were fundamentally drawn to the results of the CHARGE study, which at the most basic level showed that those who were developmentally exposed to the pesticide were also more likely to receive an autism diagnosis by age 5. However, in retrospect, that increase in likelihood of a diagnosis can be for many reasons, even if the pesticide turns out to be a cause. The pesticide might just make existing symptoms worse, for example, making diagnosis more likely (or sooner). Or, the pesticide might cause \\*some\\* symptoms in a subset of people who were going to develop \\*other\\* symptoms due to other unrelated risk factors.\n\nIn the manuscript, and in our research in general, we are pivoting to think more about neurodevelopmental disorders in general, rather than autism specifically. ADHD is also a neurodevelopmental disorder and is the largest component of the 17% prevalence among US children. And while we started this work with autism in mind because of the CHARGE study, we performed the experiments in a way that informs about all neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nIn fact, the effects on learning outcomes, to me, are the most dramatic and important. I can't think of learning tests more simple and easy than (1) learning to avoid a threat and (2) learning to get food when you're hungry. Yet the developmentally exposed mice still failed. We really need now to do the dose work see how much of the pesticide was needed for that to happen.",

Nonetheless, the changes we see in the mice are relevant to a range of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism, ADHD and intellectual disability.\n\nMore broadly, I am interested in studying environmental contributors to autism risk because those are at least somewhat controllable. Genetic studies of autism risk seem to indicate that most of the genetic risk derives from a combination of \\~1000 common, low-risk alleles. This makes any kind of prevention very difficult, even with genetic screening. However, we have at least some degree of control over our environment, and can try to reduce our exposure to known environmental risks.",

Our goal is to expose pregnant mice to a chemical that we, ourselves, are exposed to during pregnancy, and which is linked to autism risk in humans.\n\nWhen we do that, we see that the exposure during pregnancy causes changes in the mice which are very similar to symptoms of autism and neurodevelopmental disorders, including hyperactivity, repetitive behaviors, learning deficits, and changes in the dopamine system in the brain. This suggests that the exposure in humans could be causing a similar set of symptoms.",

The benchmark dose (or technically, the benchmark dose lower confidence limit, or BMDL) is determined by the EPA from a combination of human and animal studies, and represents the highest dose that might be considered safe. The current BMDL for deltamethrin is 10.1 mg/kg, and we exposed our mice to 3 mg/kg.\n\nThe BMDL is chosen, in part, based on results from rodent studies. These are often considered in combination with a correction factor that takes into account humans' slower metabolism relative to rodents. So, a significant developmental effect on mice below the BMDL means that the BMDL may not have been calculated correctly, and may not represent the highest safe dose for humans either.",

The vast majority of cases of autism do not derive from a single identifiable cause, but rather from the combination of many causes. The genetic risk, for instance, seems to primarily derive from \\~1000 common, low-risk alleles. These may consist, in part, of genes encoding susceptibility or resilience to environmental insults. Or, the environmental insults themselves may only be a cause of some of the symptoms, and genetics may contribute the remaining phenotype.",

                    "comment": "Thank you for your perspective, RogueEmpireFiend. There is no one cause of autism and I do not mean to demonstrate that a pesticide can be a singular cause. In fact, very few cases of autism arise from a single cause; instead, there are many small causes, which add up within each individual. This is the most obvious from the genetic work, which has identified 1000+ common gene variants which each contribute a very small amount of risk individually.\n\nThe reason I, and perhaps other scientists, are researching environmental causes is that, in the past 10 years, evidence has been building that the amount of autism risk that is contributed by the environment is much larger than previously thought. The most recent careful work was done by [Huguet et al 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK453174/), which estimated the risk contributed by the environment at 38-48%. That is a very large contribution of risk and we understand very little about what it might mean compared to what we know about genetic risks. These environmental factors are likely to be similar to the genetic ones - many different exposures, each contributing a small amount of risk.\n\nThe other reason I study environmental risk factors is, simply, that they are preventable.\n\nRegarding mice vs. humans, there is a great deal of autism research being conducted in humans. My study was largely inspired by a range of human epidemiology studies. Just in my area, there are clinical trials going on at the University of Toledo, University of Michigan, and just about every major University. Human genetic studies are largely how we know about the 1000+ risk genes that have been identified. I recommend you look into research being conducted at Universities in your area to see if you might be able to contribute.\n\nHowever, in order to study mechanisms, or to prove that any risk factor (gene, environment, or other) is a potential cause, you must also study animal models. It is simply not possible, nor would it be ethical, to perform genetic manipulation experiments or toxic exposure experiments in humans.\n\nThe goal of environmental factor research is the same as the goal of genetic research into autism: to find preventable causes and effective treatments. I am making my own small contribution to that using the knowledge and tools that I have.",

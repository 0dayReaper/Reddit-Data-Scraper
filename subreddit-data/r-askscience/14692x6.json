            "comment": "There is no clear answer yet on whether long COVID still exists with the new omicron variants. Some studies have suggested that omicron may cause milder illness and lower risk of long COVID than previous variants. Butj other experts have warned that omicron may still cause long COVID in some people, especially because of the large number of infections and the possibility of reinfection. More research is needed to understand the long-term effects of omicron and how to prevent and treat long COVID.\n\nhttps://time.com/6283028/long-covid-after-omicron/\n\nhttps://www.webmd.com/covid/news/20221228/is-long-covid-less-likely-omicron-strains\n\nhttps://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2022/02/harvard-experts-expect-new-wave-of-long-covid-cases/\n\nhttps://www.verywellhealth.com/omicron-long-covid-unclear-5215533\n\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health-news/omicron-and-long-covid-what-we-know-so-far",

    "postText": "During the Hadean period, which goes from Earth's formation 4.6B years ago to 4B years ago, Earth was bombarded by numerous meteorites, which brought most of its water. \n\nHowever, processes such as complete combustion and celular respiration create water, and photosynthesis destroys it. So, we have water being destroyed and new water being created all the time, essentially recicling our water.\n\nThis makes me think: how much of Earth's H2O is actually the same molecules that came to us through meteorites, and how much of it actually came from complete combustion?",

            "comment": "The discovery that there is as much or more water deep in the earth\u2019s mantle than in the earth\u2019s oceans a few years back throws into question the concept that earth\u2019s water was almost entirely delivered by comets and asteroids during the Hadean period. It suggests a significant fraction of the earth\u2019s water was intrinsically part of the planetesimals that fused to form the original Gaia body",

Outgassing from volcanic eruptions. There is multiple times more water than in all the oceans combined trapped in the mantle still, mostly bound in with minerals.\n\nThe fraction which came from meteorites is frankly a drop in the ocean.",

And the oceans from outgassing and rain after the surface cooled down (3.8 billion years ago?)  \n\nDoes this account for the thinness of Earth's atmosphere compared to Venus?",

            "comment": "Just to add:\n\nScientists believe that Europa, one of Jupiter's moons, has the most amount of water in the solar system. Europa is covered by a thick layer of ice, beneath which lies a vast ocean of liquid water. Estimates suggest that Europa's ocean contains two to three times the amount of water found on Earth's oceans. Other bodies in the solar system that are believed to have significant amounts of water include Saturn's moon Enceladus and Mars.\n\nWhere it came from, I don't know :)",

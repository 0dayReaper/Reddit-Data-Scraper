This is because the radiation emitted by these devices is so weak, they are not capable of altering your cells (non-ionizing radiation). Bananas, on the other hand, do emit ionizing radiation (just a very, very, very small amount. You do not need to be worried about bananas). So you might explain to your parents that bananas are more dangerous than cell phones, and ask them if they know anyone who has died suspiciously after eating a couple bananas",

OK, there's one other: to get the patient to shut up. Seriously, after having conversations with several dentists and their techs about the idiotic conversations they endure around x-rays, flouride, cancer screenings, and any number of other things, it's a pretty easy \"yes please\" to just throw the apron on.\n\nhttps://www.iaea.org/resources/rpop/health-professionals/dentistry/patients\n\n\n&gt;**Should patients and carers wear lead aprons and personal protective devices during a dental radiographic procedure?**\n\n&gt;With well-designed and optimized equipment and procedures there is no need for routine use of lead aprons for the patient in dental radiology. Lead aprons may provide some protection in the rare case of the vertex occlusal examination, especially in a patient who is, or may be, pregnant. On the other hand, the use of a lead apron may reassure patients that every effort is being made to ensure their safety, and may reduce the amount of time that needs to be taken to reassure them. Certainly, a lead apron should be provided for any patient who requests one. It may also be advisable to consider using them on a cautionary basis where equipment and/or technique have not been verified by a radiation protection specialist, and where they will not otherwise interfere with the examination. Thyroid collars should be used in all examinations where the thyroid may be exposed to the main beam or to a considerable amount of scatter radiation.\n\n&gt;Lead aprons must be provided for a person who is required to support a patient during the radiographic procedure (i.e., a comforter or carer). Assisting adults should be positioned so that all parts of their body are out of the main beam.\n\n",

You're always rolling the die and there is still a chance that the first  time the die lands on your unlucky number.\n\nSo best to minimize as much as you can. Minimize exposure duration, dose, and area exposed as best you can while being more useful than it's absence.\n\n\nBUT, X-Ray radiation is NOT the same as cell phone radiation in terms of danger. To understand how they are similar and are different you want to learn about the electromagnetic radiation spectrum (it includes visible light, all light is radiation, which I think people like OP's parents often completely miss).",

A ~6 hour flight gets you ~40 uSv.\n\n\nTo compare to X-Rays, here's some context that goes beyond that xkcd image when it comes to x-ray machines.\n\nThe x-ray examples the xkcd image uses is either of single-shot x-ray exposures; think like a camera flash, just a fraction of a second; or a CT which is a series of single-shot exposures with something like your camera's panoramic mode, basically they take a bunch of single images and stitch them together to make one bigger image. But a CT is still just \"camera flash\" exposures.\n\nWhat's not shown on the chart is a method called fluoro which is x-ray video, continuous uninterrupted exposure; like your light-bulb. And sometimes the patient can be getting exposed to x-ray radiation for hours continuously when they are getting cath or cardiac work. There's also all the nurses and doctors and surgeons who are in the room around the patient and the machine during the procedure. The staff are definitely suited up in lead and use as much shielding as they can, but there are limits on how much one can be shielding and still be able to do their job.\n\nFluoro is legally limited to a maximum of 180mSv/min in the U.S. (a 4500 times higher dose in one minute than a 6 hour flight), but there is no legal time limit (though there must be an alarm that goes off for every 15 minutes of accumulated exposure).\n\nLook on that chart again and place where 180mSv puts you. And I've heard of cases that have had multiple hours of exposure.\n\nAnd it's done because it's more useful than not.\n\nThat airplane ride? The risk is worth it because it's a fraction of a drop.",

            "comment": "No, it is not.\n\nPhones and other devices that broadcast (tablets, laptops, you name it ...) emit electromagnetic (EM) radiation. EM radiation comes in many different forms, but it is typically characterized by its frequency (or wavelength, the two are directly connected).\n\nMost mobile devices communicate with EM signals in the frequency range running from a few hundred megahertz (MHz) to a few gigahertz (GHz).\n\nSo what happens when we're hit with EM radiation? Well, it depends on the frequency. The frequency of the radiation determines the energy of the individual photons that make up the radiation. Higher frequency = higher energy photons. If photons have sufficiently high energy, they can damage a molecule and, by extension, a cell in your body. There's no exact frequency threshold from which point on EM radiation can cause damage in this way, but 1 petahertz (PHz, or 1,000,000 GHz) is a good rough estimate. For photons that don't have this much energy, the most they can hope to achieve is to see their energy converted into heat.\n\nConverting EM radiation into a heat is the #1 activity of a very popular kitchen appliance: The microwave oven. This device emits EM radiation with a frequency of about 2.4 GHz to heat your milk and burn your noodles (while leaving parts of the meal suspiciously cold).\n\nThe attentive reader should now say to themselves: Wait a minute! This 2.4 GHz of the microwave oven is right there between the \"few hundred MHz\" and \"few GHz\" frequency range of our mobile devices. So are our devices mini-microwave ovens?\n\nAs it turns out, 2.4 GHz is also the frequency used by many wifi routers (and devices connecting to them) (which coincidentally is the reason why poorly shielded microwave ovens can cause dropped wifi connections when active). But this is where the second important variable that determines the effects of EM radiation comes into play: intensity.\n\nA microwave oven operates with a power of somewhere around the 1,000 W (depending on the model), whereas a router has a broadcast power that is limited (by law, in most countries) to 0.1 W. That makes a microwave oven 10,000 more powerful than a wifi router at maximum output. And mobile devices typically broadcast at even lower intensities, to conserve battery. And while microwave ovens are designed to focus their radiation on a small volume in the interior of the oven, routers and mobile devices throw their radiation out in every direction.\n\nSo, not only is EM radiation emitted by our devices not energetic enough to cause direct damage, the intensity with which it is emitted is orders of magnitude lower to cause any noticeable heating.\n\nBut to close, I would like to discuss one more source of EM radiation. A source from which we receive radiation with frequencies ranging from 100 terahertz (THz) to 1 PHz or even slightly more. Yes, that overlaps with the range of potentially damaging radiation. And even more, the intensity of this radiation varies, but can reach up to tens of W. That's not the total emitted, but the total that directly reaches a human being. Not quite microwave oven level, but enough to make you feel much hotter when exposed to it.\n\nSo what is this source of EM radiation and why isn't it banned yet? The source is none other than the Sun. (And it's probably not yet banned due to the powerful agricultural lobby.) Our Sun blasts us with radiation that is far more energetic (to the point where it can be damaging) than anything our devices produce and with far greater intensity. Even indoors, behind a window, you'll receive so much more energy from the Sun (directly or indirectly when reflected by the sky or various objects) than you do from the ensemble of our mobile devices.",

The normal stuff like light, infrared, UV, radio is so common and harmless, we don't think of it as radiation, except when speaking scientifically. \n\nThe reason ionizing radiation is dangerous is that high concentrations of ionizing radiation are so powerful they penetrate all but the most dense matter (ex. lead). Ionizing radiation has so much energy, when it's traveling through matter, it smashes through it, breaking apart molecular bonds. When these molecular bonds are in your DNA, your DNA can get messed up and that cell in you body won't function properly any more. A few cells here and there, your body can handle, the cells self-destruct or are otherwise cleaned up. But if too many get messed up DNA, they get out of control, these cells run amok. We call that cancer.\n\n[Also, here's a handy chart from XKCD explaining the scale and levels of dangerous ionizing radiation.](https://xkcd.com/radiation/)",

However, it is completely filtered by the atmosphere and does not reach the earth's surface.\n\n&gt;Medium-wavelength UVB is very biologically active but cannot penetrate beyond the superficial skin layers. It is responsible for delayed tanning and burning; in addition to these short-term effects it enhances skin ageing and significantly promotes the development of skin cancer. Most solar UVB is filtered by the atmosphere.\n\n&gt;The relatively long-wavelength UVA accounts for approximately 95 per cent of the UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface. It can penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin and is responsible for the immediate tanning effect. Furthermore, it also contributes to skin ageing and wrinkling. For a long time it was thought that UVA could not cause any lasting damage. Recent studies strongly suggest that it may also enhance the development of skin cancers.",

This is to stop particle radiation like cosmic rays. Then you have some dense metal, like lead or tungsten. This stops the ionizing radiation. You have to put them in that order, if the charged particles hit the dense metal first, they create deadly \"brehmsstralung\" or secondary radiation.\n\nFar more information that you'll ever want or need, written for the layman sci-fi author or games designer, can be found here: http://www.projectrho.com/public_html/rocket/radiation.php",

If you mean trying to create an earth-like atmosphere around an object in space, not only will that not be possible for centuries if ever (without a container of some sort), but it wouldn't be helpful unless it's multiple km deep. You could contain it with some sort of balloon I suppose, but that introduces its own problems and sort of defeats the purpose (a metal wall is lighter, simpler, and more effective).\n\nIf you mean some sort of shield \u00e0 la star trek, it would certainly work for ionized particles (though I don't believe this is a concern, they don't penetrate solids). As for EM radiation though, magnetic fields can't do much of anything. From a brief bit of research it appears that magnetic fields can interact with light, but this is due to the magnetic field bending spacetime (gravity). Technically possible, but not really useful or feasible.",

There are no known effects of radio waves on the human body that cannot be attributed to heating, nor are any measurable effects expected from theory. There is no reason to expect harm to accumulate over time if the harm is nonexistent to begin with.\n\nUltimately, since there can always been unknown unknowns, we can turn to epidemiology. In the span of 50 years we have gone from almost no one having a mobile device to a majority of humans having a mobile device. In that time, no disease has tracked this increase. Long before mobile devices, we also had high powered radio transmitters, and we didn't always have regulations to keep people away from them, but the people working there did not get weird diseases, and didn't feel anything that could not be attributed to heating (aside from a tingling sensation from ELF transmitters).\n\nI even tried to see if, as an exercise in ridiculousness, I could find any disease, *anything*, that correlates well with cell phone use. The best I could due is that the number of people who own Apple iPhones correlates (after hacking the y-axis) with ratio of people who die of cancer on thursday opposed to other days https://i.imgur.com/30HqHzL.png . The number of people who own smartphones also correlates over recent years with the risk of falling off a cliff, and car vs. truck accidents. Actually, those two make a little sense.",

Essentially the universe s mostly a cold, dark and empty space, with isolated pockets of matter and energy sprinkled around, and on at least one of these isolated spots of energy/matter, life forms have evolved some specialized cells that convert a tiny part of the EM spectrum into what we know as vision. What we know as vision, light etc is essentially just a construct (like consciousness itself) in a dark universe.",

I'm taking part in an international study called [Cosmos](http://www.ukcosmos.org/) which is tracking the health of thousands of people to try to determine if there is any long term effects that are not immediately obvious. When the study was started the assumption was that there would be no effects to radiation of this power level and frequency range but it had never been studied in detail for extended periods of time and there was a media frenzy about mobile phones causing health damage (which makes funding easy to get).\n\nI forget how long the study has been going now but it's many years. There was an interim report a couple of years ago and, as expected, no ill effects were found. IIRC the study is scheduled to run for 40 years so I'll be an old man by the time it ends.",

While antenna gains as symmetrical, amplifier gains are not.  Optionally, you could put a preamplifer on the router that boosts the power of signals being received by the router so that the router can hear the other devices better.  Another poster brought up that you could theoretically reach a power output value that actually makes the received signal too strong for your phone to correctly receive and process.  This is theoretically true, but a 10x power increase in this case probably wouldn't be enough to actually cause this problem, especially if you're at a distance that previously was spotty with coverage.  We don't implement changes likes these mostly to prevent needless interference, and to conserve energy on mobile devices.\n\nThat said, land mobile radios, like those used by police, fire, town public works departments, etc do use this method.  To allow people in vehicles or on foot to communicate over large distances, a repeater is setup with a strong amplifier, receiver pre amp, and antenna, typically on a tower/hill/mountain etc.  A handheld unit might transmit at 5 watts, but the repeater can hear that due to it's pre-amp, antenna, and height advantage.  It then rebroadcasts the signal on a slightly different frequency with significantly more power (ex 150 watts) from a much better antenna in a better location than the handheld radio.  The result is you can now get a bunch of lower power units to talk to a base station or each other over distances larger than they could cover alone.",

I think the power adjustment function is often more difficult to find than it needs to be. It\u2019s probably the most important button and yet it is placed in such a way that it blends in with all the other buttons. I\u2019m no UI expert but I think the most important and most often used buttons should always be the biggest and easiest to find. Of course, once they find the button, it needs to be easy and intuitive to use as well. People expect to spend exactly 2.5 mindless seconds operating it. Since adjusting power requires multiple button presses, sometimes requiring the use of the number keypad, it\u2019s too complicated and takes too long so nobody uses it. This is why I\u2019m an advocate of power knobs. They are simple, intuitive, universally recognized, visually prominent, and quick to use. \n\nTL;DR: give us power knobs",

Give it a short calibration blast, see the temperature increase and guess density/water content and decide power and time from there.\n\nYou can use the IR camera to detect colder spots on the surface and aim the microwave radiation in the same way those tray-less microwaves do it but intelligently to eliminate cold spots.\n\nHave a top and bottom grill element to get some dry heat to finish the exterior of certain foods.\n\nGo one step further and have top and side facing cameras internally, machine learning image recognition it and work out what the food actually is to make an even better cooking decision.\n\nNow add a subscription model to the cloud based food recognition service and you have the microwave of the future, just $99 per year for perfectly reheated food every time.\n\nMan I think I should quit my job and become a microwave engineer.",

Well shielded definitely seems to reduce the range it'll interfere, but it doesn't completely contain it.\n\n&gt;So, not only is EM radiation emitted by our devices not energetic enough to cause direct damage, the intensity with which it is emitted is orders of magnitude lower to cause any noticeable heating.\n\nAlso worth noting: Even if you're not carrying a single mobile device, not even wearing a watch or in a house with a microwave oven, if you are anywhere you could potentially get a cell signal you are being hit by ~0.8-2Ghz EM radiation being shot at your from cell towers. Potentially even 5Ghz EM radiation if you or your neighbors have 5Ghz cordless phones. Plus continous ~1Ghz frequencies coming in from GPS and 12-18Ghz frequencies coming in from Satellite TV. \n\nBasically, unless you want to live in a cave in the woods there is no way to avoid getting bombarded by *some* level of man made radiation.

Due to free space loss the signal from the tower is going to be much lower than the signal from the phone you hold next to your head.  \n\nAt a distance of 3 inches at 1Ghz, you burn about 10dB, which drops a cell signal from a phone around 500mw to 40mw.  At 3 miles the loss is about 105db, which drops a 100w signal down to about 0.000003mw.

            "comment": "No. Most evidence says it isn't true.\n\nRadio waves are a form of electromagnetic (EM) radiation and the term \"radiation\" scares a lot of people, but EM radiation also includes the heat from the sun, visible light, radio waves, and x-rays. Some of these are more dangerous than others. In a lot of cases people in medicine and physics talk about \"ionizing\" and \"non-ionizing\" radiation. \"Ionizing\" radiation means that it can knock an election lose (making an \"ion\") and break a chemical bond. Since our DNA is a large molecule this type of radiation can change the structure of DNA and create errors in the DNA which can cause cancer. Non-ionizing radiation can't do this. Radio waves, and visible light are all lower energy non-ionizing radiation, while ultra violet light and x-rays are ionizing radiation.\n\nNow, having said that, obviously enough heat will cause burns. Microwaves are non-ionizing, but enough of them can boil water and cook meat, so it isn't enough to just say that \"non-ionizing\" means that it's safe. Now a microwave oven produces 500-1000 watts of EM radiation, while a cell phone produces at most 0.7-1 watt (some old ones could go up to 3 watts, but in practice cell phones try to send a weaker signal to conserve battery life, so even the 0.7 watt is very rare). A 1000 watt light bulb will really hurt your eyes while a 1 watt bulb isn't enough to read by, and it's a similar for cell phone -- very low power doesn't appear to be a concern.\n\nNow, one other problem is that In addition to the strong chemical bonds (e.g. ionic and covalent), there are also weaker bonds (e.g. hydrogen bonds) that don't actually require ionizing radiation to break them. Now breaking a hydrogen bond in DNA doesn't change the structure, but it can unzip the DNA, and cause different genes to be expressed. Every cell in your body has the same DNA, but your liver and your skin cells read different parts of the DNA so they make different proteins, which means they look and act differently. Some non-ionizing radiation can affect this (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633881/) and while this is the same general range as the airport body scanners, the scanners probably don't provide enough energy or for long enough to show this effect. However, some of the new 5G cell phones, and some high-speed wireless (that some phone companies are rolling out to simplify connecting new houses, not the normal WiFi), also use similar EM energies and they would involve much longer exposure times so should probably be studied better.\n\nFor a long time there was concern about living near high voltage power lines, since they also produce EM radiation (of the non-ionizing type). It turns out that people who live under power lines get cancer more often, but when this was analysed more carefully, the problem is that poor people tend to live under power lines and poor people tend to get cancer more often. We still don't know exactly why poor people tend to get cancer more -- it could be don't know if this is this is due to stress, food, chemicals from clothes, or less access to health care, but we're now sure that it isn't due to the power lines).\n\nNothing is absolutely, provably, safe in all cases, and it is worth continuing to examine new technologies, but as far as wee can tell there's more danger from not getting enough sleep due to staying up playing on your phone than there is from the radiation from the phone.",

More telling, however, are the results of the informal experiment that we are all taking part in every day. Cellphones have been frequently used by a significant portion of the population for decades now, more than long enough for any associated pathology to make itself known. Although it is true that there may be further developments as time goes on and we see the effects of a full lifetime of use, it would appear that instances of things like brain cancer and dementia have not risen in any appreciable way that tracks the proliferation of cellphone use, nor does there seem to be any increase in risk as dose increases. \n\nGiven all this it is pretty safe to say that there is no need for concern but if you are still worried then you could take some basic precautions like using a wired headset or speakerphone when making calls, keeping your phone in a bag or hip holster if you are worried about your gonads and, of course, you could try to limit your usage.\n\n[EDIT]\nP.S. You shouldn't take my word for all this though, I'm neither a doctor nor scientist, the writers of the blog linked below, however, definitely are. Rather than linking a single article or firing off a bunch of URLs, I have provided a link to a search of the topic on SBM (Science-Based Medicine) so you can choose which ones to read for yourself.  \nAs a small aside I couldn't recommend SBM more highly, they are a fantastic bunch of writers and they really (like, really really)know their shit. They blog about more than just medicine too btw so you'll find a few gems covering other areas of science too.\n\nhttps://sciencebasedmedicine.org/?s=Cellphone+radiation&amp;category_name=&amp;submit=Search",

How something like that effects a biological system is too complex for speculation. Even if the radiation doesn't have enough energy to create radicals, even just producing localized sub-dermal warming could have implications. Linear thinking that works in physics doesn't really suit biology which has so much going on that we don't understand. ",

Such changes may be caused by a sequence of biological processes and may affect the living organism at different levels (from the molecular to the cellular, the organ, and the whole living organism) activating various mechanisms that affect health.\n\nEpidemiologic studies pointing to an association between non-ionizing radiation and the development of cancerous tumors led to a working hypothesis that living cells in the body are able to 'sense' non-ionizing radiation and react to it without undergoing heating. To verify this hypothesis, the effects of different frequencies of non-ionizing radiation on intracellular processes in tissue cultures of various cell types were studied. \n\nAs expected, non-ionizing radiation did not have a significant effect on the DNA sequence or on its structure.  Conversely, slight but reproducible effects were observed on intracellular mechanisms of signal transduction, including of free radical formation, phosphorylation and protein breakdown. These findings showed that cells are able to 'sense' non-ionizing radiation; however to date there is no evidence that the 'sensing' leads to physiological changes, including cell proliferation or death. \n\nIn order to reveal the mechanisms whereby radiation affects living cells, additional research on more sensitive systems (such as mutation -bearing or DNA-deficient cells) is needed.",

            "comment": "Another user gave a wonderful answer already, but it lacks some of the very specific data.\n\nThere are two kinds of ways that \"radiation\" or electromagnetic waves can hurt you.\n\nThe mild way is with heat transfer. We all own and operate a cool device that performs this in a contained box: the microwave.\n\nWhen a photon collides with an atom, it is either reflected away or it is absorbed by the atom's electron(s). When the electron absorbs the energy, it speeds up and bumps to a higher energy level (where it is unstable and imbalanced), and then falls back down while releasing that energy as heat, light, etc.\n\nThis can warm you up as you absorb that energy. The hydrogen atom in the water in your skin might catch a photon, release the energy as heat, and cause the molecule to wiggle a little more than normal, which you'll feel as heat if it happens enough.\n\nWith enough heat transfer, you can cause some fun chemical reactions, most notably combustion, or some physical changes like melting or vaporization.\n\nThis can definitely harm you, but only in extremes. Your phone battery and circuitry will generate much more heat than you could ever absorb from it's radiation. \n\nSo how else cab radiation hurt you? In a process called **ionization**.\n\nIonization occurs when the photon has so much energy that when an electron absorbs the photon, it speeds up so much that it actually escapes it's orbit of the nucleus. By losing an electron, the atom now has an imbalanced charge and by definition becomes an **ion**.\n\nTherefore this atom was ionized. \n\nThe ionization energy requires is different for each element and electron energy level on that element, but the simplest is the ionization level of hydrogen, which only has one electron. It requires 13.6 electron volts (a measurement of energy) to ionize a hydrogen atom.\n\nAnyone who's taken some chemistry might start thinking now \"hold on, what if the electron that leaves was part of a bond?\"\n\nElectrons are what allow atoms to form molecular bonds. If one suddenly gets  blasted away, we have a problem: The bond will break.\n\nThat breaks the molecule. For simple molecules like water, nbd. It'll find a new hydrogen soon enough.\n\nThe real danger is for massive long chain molecules like DNA.\n\nWhen you break a bond in a DNA molecule, it doesn't always get fixed properly. When it doesn't get fixed properly, the cell either dies, or it can \"glitch out\" and continually reproduce. That's the fast and dirty definition of what cancer is.\n\nWell the good news is that most electromagnetic radiation doesn't have photons with enough energy to even do that. You only get to that amount of energy when you're in the UV,  x-ray, and gamma radiation range.\n\nRadio, microwaves, and visible light simply do not contain enough energy per photon to cause ionization.",

We can conclude that not only phones don\u2019t increase brain cancer risk, but also that nothing did. ",

There is, however, a lot of hype and emotion-driven hand wringing in some circles online - not different from all the conspiracy theories you see online all the time.\n\nThe transmitter on a typical cell phone makes about 1 W of electromagnetic radiation. I am a HAM radio operator. Me and my buddies build and use transmitters up to 1 kW (1000 times more powerful) or more, at all kinds of frequencies (including those that are close to cell phone frequencies) and with all kinds of modulation (including digital transmissions like the ones used by cell phones). This hobby is over one century old now. No one in this hobby is dying of any mysterious illnesses. Case closed.",

Concentrated doses in the for of beams can easily cause severe burns. It is even used to shape diamonds, one of the hardest materials know to man. \n\nMost people call that type of radiation light.

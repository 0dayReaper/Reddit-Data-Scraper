[Why is the sky dark at night?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxJ4M7tyLRE)   \n\nSummary:  \n\n* Universe had a beginning so there aren't necessarily stars in every direction\n* Some of the far away stars light hasn't reached us yet\n* The really far away stars light is red-shifted towards infrared (not visible to the naked eye) because of the expansion of the universe. \n\nEdit: To add in some points from the comments.  \n\n* Yes some of the light from distant stars is blocked by dust and other objects in the way. The dust tends to absorb visible wavelengths and re-emit in the IR range which we can\u2019t see but that wasn\u2019t in the video so I didn\u2019t include it in my summary.   \n\n* Inverse-square law for light intensity. Intensity reduces massively over interstellar distances but that doesn\u2019t really help answer the question because every star does this. Multiplied by an infinite number of stars in every direction, suddenly that tiny bit of light from each star adds up and the night sky should be far brighter than it is. For why it isn\u2019t, I refer you back to the video and my original 3 points.",

If we could, then the night sky (rather, just the sky) wouldn\u2019t stop us from seeing things. \n\nBut the light scatter from the atmosphere would blind us when our half of the earth faced the sun - much like trying to use night vision goggles in the day time.\n\nSo, I guess the evolutionary path our eyes took was to see really well when the sun light was scattered by the atmosphere (day time) and not so well when there is no light scatter (night time). Had it been reversed, we would consider night time our day and have to rush to darkness at sunrise because it would blind us. The current way is much better for survival, it seems.\n\nAm I overthinking this?",

Anything main-sequence (look up the HR-diagram if you\u2019re unfamiliar) should be relatively stable, but you don\u2019t want anything too massive because of the amount of time we currently believe it takes life to develop on a planet. \n\nEarth has been around for ~4.5 billion years, but the earliest prokaryotes arose around ~3.8-3.9 billion years ago. A star of three solar masses (most likely a class B star) only lives for around 600 million years, meaning we don\u2019t generally look at an exoplanet orbiting that star as a good place for life to evolve because chances are high that you wouldn\u2019t even get a few primitive prokaryotes before the star exits the main sequence. In addition to this, a star with that mass likely has a high surface area, which means more radiation being emitted (most stars emit the same amount of radiation per unit area). High stellar radiation without protection= bad for life, so that\u2019s where wavelength comes in, but again, that\u2019s more a consequence of mass and much less likely to affect prokaryotes than complex life, which is an important distinction because we\u2019re not necessarily looking for complex life. We\u2019re just looking for something which fits the description of life in general.",

One of the earliest results of quantum theory is that light is quantized - every photon has a fixed amount of energy related to its frequency.  The only way one photon can have more energy than another photon is if it has a higher frequency (this is to say that photon's don't have an \"intensity\".. intense light just means you have more photons).\n\nSo, depending on how much energy an electron in a star loses as it falls to a lower-energy level, it'll emit a photon with a frequency corresponding to that energy.\n\nThe differences in energy levels of electrons themselves is determined by the orbital shells around a nucleus.  These have specific energies associated with them, and when an electron moves from one to another, it either emits or absorbs a photon of the corresponding wavelength.\n\nThe frequencies we see in light from the sun correspond to the differences in energy levels.  This is one of the ways that we can determine the elements and relative abundance of them in faraway stars.  All the different elements have different orbital shell energies, and we can look at the frequencies coming from a source and work-back the kinds of elements that produce those frequencies.",

That is because hotter objects emit [more light at all wavelengths](http://quantumfreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/black-body-radiation-curves.png), even as the peak intensity shifts to shorter wavelengths with temperature. So the sun is emitting in those wavelengths, and the sun is so much closer than any other stars.\n\nAlso, distant galaxies are shifted to the infrared, but they are very dim compared to the stars in our own galaxy. They would hardly blind you even if you could see IR. \n\nSide note: Sunlight intensity [peaks in the visible wavelengths](http://www.sunlightinside.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Sunlight_spectrum_Fiji_July.jpg), and water is transparent in the visible wavelengths but [gets opaque outside of that window](http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/images/water_spectrum_2.gif).

The eye adapts by having a *pupil* that shrinks to reduce the amount of light entering the eye, and by having two separate detectors with different sensitivity -- *rods* that operate under weak illumination (but are totally swamped during the day), and *cones* that see colors and operate under strong illumination levels (but are useless at night).\n\nCones: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopic_vision\n\nRods: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotopic_vision\n\nThere's no reason why we couldn't have a third type of receptor that's sensitive to the infrared.

Older tubes did a similar trick, but did not have the reflexes to go all the way to daylight. It's not a good idea to use them in direct sunlight, but they can handle brief exposure (such as someone turning on the lights in a room).",

It's advantageous to the plant for the fruit to be eaten, after all. Bear in mind that fruit only appeared on the planet about 140 million years ago, long after sight had evolved, and about 60 million years after the earliest mammals.\n\nOur perception of color (as opposed to wavelength), though, may very well have evolved (in part) to help identify when fruits are best.\n\nOr, perhaps more accurately, animals seeing the light they do informed the evolution of fruit just as much as fruits reflecting the wavelengths they do informed the evolution of sight.",

You know how the surface of a pool creates caustic effects where there's a pattern of concentrated bright spots and dull spots on the bottom? That's due to refraction from the water surface. Our atmosphere does exactly the same thing to light that passes through it, just to a lesser degree since air is not as dense as water. The twinkling is when the atmosphere has refracted the light from a star in such a way that some of the photons either get spread out, or concentrated.\n\n[You can easily see this distortion effect when looking at the moon through a telescope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9OHHRjtKvk).

In order for you to even see a star shining, even if it twinkles, that means a lot of photons are already entering your eye.\n\nThe perceptible twinkle is a variance in intensity procduced by other causes. I think chiefly it's pressure waves in our atmosphere.\n\nIt's similar to the shimmering of light on the floor of a pool in the summer. Except you are tiny and on the bottom of the pool and the sun is so dark that you can only see it when a bright spot on the pool floor hits your eye. So it appears to twinkle as the light and dark spots hit you.",

The \"thickness\" of your laser ray is smaller than a moving wave from the surface of the water. Therefore the angle at which your laser ray will hit the bottom of the pool changes constantly. It \"dances\" at the bottom of the pool. These are called \"speckles\". Take a very large light source, like the one we use to light up the sky or search for enemy planes at night during WWII. The diameter of that light source is greater than waves. Hence, even if the edges may be fuzzy, the large circle of light remains fixed at the bottom of the pool.

Next time you're out in a clear night, you should be able to tell that stars near the top of the sky (right above you) twinkle less (or seemingly not at all) compared to stars nearer the edge of sky/horizon. This is because starlight traveling from stars near the horizon pass through more atmosphere than starlight from stars near the zenith.

Cover the flashlight with your hand and observe, then move a few feet away from the light source and observe it hitting your hand again. The closer you are to the light source, the more dense the photons are, and the brighter your hand will be. There won't ever be gaps between photons, but the amount of photons hitting you will be smaller the farther away you get.",

The issue is that we the photon's position (it's hitting your hand). \n\nTake a look at a phenomenon known as 'shot noise' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shot_noise). Essentially, the exact number of photons hitting the receiver changes. Take this to the extreme case where you would expect a single photon at a time, and you technically get gaps between when a photon arrives (e.g. in single-photon detectors).",

The 1/r^2 dependence of brightness from stars at a distance r would exactly cancel out the r^2 dependence of the number of stars at a distance r. Thus, a spherical shell of radius r centred on Earth should contribute the same amount of starlight to us regardless of r, on average. In an infinite universe, such shells would extend forever, and the sky would appear infinitely bright. The reason this doesn't happen in our universe is that distant stars are redshifted due to the expansion of space, which makes them dimmer, and the visible universe is not infinitely big.",

You can tell what color they are.   \n\n\nThen he took us outside and spread them far apart all over the parking lot.     Now, you couldn't really tell there were marbles at all and could only see ones that were close or many clumped together.   \n\nHe basically said each one of the marbles represnets a photon of light.   Densly packed together they are easily seen.   But when they become spread out over a large area, there are fewer residing in a small area.    So even though each individual photon is mostly the same brightness individually, it has increased distance from other photons so the group as a whole appears dimmer.     \n\nProbably isn't exactly right in terms of what is going on, but helped get our midns thinking on the impacts of growing dimensional space.",

[a negative overall trend can turn into a positive trend when viewed in groups](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Simpson%27s_paradox_continuous.svg/640px-Simpson%27s_paradox_continuous.svg.png?1511787464814), implying causal relationships that don't exist. If the blue dots are people and the red dots are dogs, and this is a plot of life span vs running speed, looking at the whole you might think \"if you run faster, your life is shorter\". \n\nOr the birthday paradox. [in a group of people larger than 23, you are likely to find a pair with the same birthday](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Birthday_paradox_probability.svg/800px-Birthday_paradox_probability.svg.png?1511787554049)\n\nOr the False Positive Paradox, which relies on Bayes Rule which is nonintuitive. [A highly accurate test, say, for a disease, returning a positive result, can still be weak evidence of the disease.](https://imgur.com/vDmg6Zp)\n\nThe Coastline paradox: [the length of the coast of any given landmass can be resolved to any number, by varying the length of your meterstick.](http://40.media.tumblr.com/cdb7b518ed96f5d1ba3abace99077638/tumblr_n5s9fhsUsw1sutkk1o1_500.png)\n\nThe [Faraday Paradox](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Faraday_paradox_(electrochemistry\\)), wherein it is observed that low-concentration nitric acid will attack steel, but high-concentration acid will not. \n\n[Arrow's paradox](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Arrow's_impossibility_theorem), which can't be explained succinctly, but is a favorite of mine: basically, a voting system cannot have all of the desirable properties of a voting system at the same time. (non-dictatorship, universality, independence of irrelevant alternatives, unanimity) \n\n-----\n\nAnd there are some such paradoxes that must have a resolution, because they are physical phenomena, but the resolution is unknown. \n\nSuch as the [Faint Young Sun Paradox](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Faint_young_Sun_paradox). The Sun was not bright enough to melt ice on earth for the first billion years of its existence, yet there was liquid water on Earth at the time. \n\n[The GZK paradox](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Greisen%E2%80%93Zatsepin%E2%80%93Kuzmin_limit), cosmic rays hit the Earth with more energy than should be possible.\n\n[The paradox of youth](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Galactic_Center#/Stellar_population), there are too many young stars near the SMBC at the center of the Milky Way. \n\n[The Information Paradox](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Black_hole_information_paradox), black holes seem to destroy information, contrary to known laws of physics. \n\nedit: fixed parenthesis in link, added explanation to Simpsons graph",

Stuff like dust would just emit energy as infrared light regardless of what wavelength the energy was when it was deposited as heat into the particle(s) of dust or gas, unless it's REALLY hot.\n\nAll of that said, this really only half answers OP's question, because the other half of why everything isn't bathed in light and you can't see all the stars and galaxies in the night sky is also a matter of magnitude, since (in short) the dispersion of light from a single point into space lowers the magnitude of light received proportional to distance from the source. Most of the light emitted by anything will just exist as energy in space pretty much forever.",

The starlight problem can be resolved with a universe of finite age and a finite speed of light: only a finite number of stars' light can be visible at any time from a given point in the universe. However, SurprisedPotato's answer is relevant to the CMB for a different part of the paradox. From the Wikipedia page on Olber's Paradox:\n\n&gt;However, the Big Bang theory introduces a new paradox: it states that the sky was much brighter in the past, especially at the end of the recombination era, when it first became transparent. All points of the local sky at that era were comparable in brightness to the surface of the Sun, due to the high temperature of the universe in that era; and most light rays will terminate not in a star but in the relic of the Big Bang.\n&gt;\n&gt;This paradox is explained by the fact that the Big Bang theory also involves the expansion of space, which can cause the energy of emitted light to be reduced via redshift. More specifically, the extreme levels of radiation from the Big Bang have been redshifted to microwave wavelengths (1100 times the length of its original wavelength) as a result of the cosmic expansion, and thus forms the cosmic microwave background radiation.\n\nThus, the problem of why the night sky is not brightly lit by the light of the Big Bang is, in fact, explained by the redshift in the remnant that forms the CMB.\n",

The sphere receives all the energy of the sun, but the bigger the sphere, the bigger its area, the lower the energy received per unit area is. Since the area is a function of the square of the distance, the energy per unit area(Watts/m^2) varies with the inverse square of the distance. Thus if you get a little far away from a star, you get a big drop in energy per area. Since the earth is a fixed area, this just means a big drop in energy. With distances of many light years, the drop in energy per area is insane. ",

That contains about 0.000012 Joules of cosmic microwave background.\n\nAssuming half of that strikes the earth each second (which won't be correct, but will be about the right order of magnitude) that means the earth absorbs 6 microwatts (0.000006 Watts) of CMB energy per cubic metre per second. \n\nThat's 250 million times less energy than sunlight. If you're hoping to make a nice cup of tea with energy harvested from the CMB, you'll need a collector the size of a football field - and it will still take 24 days to warm up your perfectly insulated teacup from room temperature to boiling point.

            "comment": "Incredibly sad to see that no one has provided the correct answer. While it is true that the red shift from the expansion of the Universe does play a role, it's a minor one, at least at this point in time, and the inverse square law is entirely irrelevant as the amount of stars at some distance grows with the square of that distance, which cancels out the inverse square law of the intensity of the emitted light.\n\nEDIT: For the CMB the expansion of the Universe is the key factor for not lighting up our sky and in that regard /u/Surprisedpotato's answer is correct , but not when it comes to star light as in OP's question.\n\nThe real answer to your specific question is time. The Universe has a beginning, a birth. The Big Bang happened a finite time ago so light from distant stars have only had a limited amount of time to travel, which means that light from the furthest reaches of space haven't had time to reach us. And most of the light emitted from the far reaches of space will never reach us, because of the expansion of the Universe, which is why that does play a role but that role will be a bigger, more important one, later on in time.",

Yes, the universe expanded at a rate faster than the speed of light but empty space is not a particle, merely the space in which particles sit, and therefore expanding faster than light does not invalidate the 'speed limit'. The Universe here is not even moving, the space between two points are being stretched. Nothing is moving, only new space is being created.\n\n[Inflation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_\\(cosmology\\)) theory is accepted by most scientists, as a number of inflation model predictions have been confirmed by observation. \n\nMany physicists also believe that inflation explains the origin of the large-scale structure of the cosmos, why the universe appears to be the same in all directions (isotropic), why the cosmic microwave background radiation is distributed evenly, why the Universe is flat, and why no magnetic monopoles have been observed.",

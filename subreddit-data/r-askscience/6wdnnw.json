            "comment": "Electricity is run on an alternating current (AC) which reverses voltage in the pattern of a sine wave. In the US, the frequency of this alternating is 60 Hz, which is a B flat (more of a flat B or sharp B flat, really). Sometimes interactions with surroundings, especially at high voltages like in transformers, can cause a hum at the frequency the grid is run on. In most of Europe, as an example, it's run at 50 Hz not 60 Hz, so you would hear a G (a little sharp) instead of a B flat.",

                    "comment": "Good answer! To expand on this, in the industry we call it \"60 cycle hum\":  Electrical current flow creates a magnetic field, and transformers have cores made of ferrous metal.  So the changing alternating-current is causing the big metal cores to move a little bit in a way that matches the rate at which the current changes.\n\nThe fundamental frequency is 60Hz like our power frequency, but because of a phenomenon called [\"magnetostriction\"](http://tdvib.com/magnetostriction/) the transformer iron vibrates at twice that rate, or 120Hz.\n\nIf an electrical load on a piece of equipment screws up that normal 60Hz current we can absolutely hear it:  Transformers that have a ton of current harmonics no longer produce a nice \"60 cycle hum\", but can have a much louder, sharper buzz that sounds very noticeably different.",

Do they still bother doing this, now that most clocks use quartz  or internet connectivity to stay accurate?",

                                    "comment": "All hydro, gas, nuclear, and coal plants connected to the grid have governor systems which control the amount of fuel (water, steam, etc) entering the turbine in an attempt to keep the system frequency at 60Hz. If system frequency falls, all generator governors connected to the grid pass more fuel to the turbine to speed it up. The opposite is true for high frequency. A perfect 60Hz AC on the grid requires an exact balance of generation and demand, but since load is varying all the time, frequency is mostly maintained within about 59.98 to 60.02 Hz. Beyond these ranges, if frequency starts to get really bad (like 59.8 to 60.2 Hz), then special protection systems will automatically disconnect loads or generators to return the frequency to normal. Since the Eastern and Western halves of North America are separate synchronous grids (with the exception of Quebec and Texas), every region in each of those grids has to be perfectly balanced to maintain frequency. If the grid as a whole has been under or over generated for a significant amount of time, it produces \"time error\", the slowing or speeding of a clock which runs on the 60Hz mains frequency compared to a reference clock. In the Eastern interconnect, time error is measured and recorded by one system operator designated the Time Monitor. Once time error exceeds 10 seconds positive or negative, all system operators in the interconnect participate in a \"time error correction\", in which they change their scheduled system frequency to 59.98 or 60.02Hz. This causes their automatic generation control systems (fast moving regulation for small changes in demand without requiring redispatch of the whole generation fleet) to trend generation slightly high or low for a time, reversing the time error until it reaches around 0 seconds again. If you look for time error correction on NERC's website, it dives into a lot of detail. Whether or not this is still necessary, I don't really know, but time error correction is definitely still done. ",

I would guess there are very few electric clocks left in existence that rely on grid frequency for oscillation. Certainly none that are used for any critical purpose. Ever since the 1980s, when quartz oscillators and the related electronics became very cheap, any serious timing application would use internal quartz oscillation and not be sensitive to grid frequency. In addition, the automated solutions for correction / calibration are now so easy, with the Internet based Network Time Protocol or using a GPS receiver. ",

If it's a device that is supposed to be powered by plugging it into the wall, then a stepped down AC signal is often readily available and can be directly connected to one of the inputs of the microcontroller.\n\nThis saves the hassle of having to add an external oscillator instead of relying on the builtin oscillator. That would have only been a small amount of extra parts, but why bother when it isn't actually needed.\n\nOf course, if I really cared about precise time keeping, I'd get an RTC chip instead. Cheap quartz oscillators often aren't all that precise either, but RTC chips tend to be pretty good even when temperatures fluctuate.",

They work very hard to keep it at 60Hz probably just because all our gear is optimized to run at that speed.\n\nSimply put:  The more stuff that people turn on, the more it slows down the generators (and the more the frequency drops), so the more power has to be supplied to the grid.

Why does the frequency of the grid drop suddenly when the load goes up? And why does it go up when the load drops? This is because when there is a load increase, the additional load is supplied by a loss in the kinetic energy of the turbine which means it slows down ever so suddenly. The turbine rotating 60 times a second is what keeps the electric voltage at 60Hz. When the turbine slows, the frequency drops below 60. The generator detects this and ramps up the output to bring the turbine back to 60Hz. The opposite happens when load drops. The excess energy causes the turbine to spin a bit faster, before the generator detects and lowers output.",

Power companies provide generation resources and serve loads.\n\nThe entity controlling voltage, frequency, reliability, balancing, and a few other functions is called an Independent System Operator (at least in North America). There are 7 of these companies, and each oversees many power companies.\n\nWhen there is a surge in demand (or a sudden drop in generation), *every* online generator responds. This is simply because they have automatic governors in the generators themselves to maintain frequency at 60Hz. \n\n&gt; what is there to make sure Company B does their fair share of extra supply? \n\nHonestly, that's not built into real-time operations at all. Power is needed, power is supplied; that's it. Companies are paid for each MWh produced, just like you pay for each KWh you use in your house. There is an economic incentive for each company to produce what we call for. But there is a whole after-the-fact settlements process to make sure payments are made to where they need to go. ",

For instance, in Alberta (the energy market I am familiar with), a company sells a block of power at the market, say 30-40MW. The energy regulator then is given remote control of the plant and can operate it between those two limits. The company is paid for their block (just being available to provide that amount of power) AND the actual power consumed by the end users. Then there are all sorts of other services power companies can provide that they are paid for. I can expand on some points more if there's interest.",

Small gasoline motors generate more horsepower at higher rpms so a 2 pole generator makes sense. You sacrifice some efficiency at lower loads as the engine Alesha has to spin at 3600 rpm, but get more high end capacity for a given size of engine. Medium size diesel engines produce gobs of low end torque, and don't do well at higher rpms, so 4 pole generators and 1800 rpm is more common. Large diesel engines sometimes will use 8 pole units and run at 900 rpm, continuing the tradeoff of rpms for torque. There's nothing preventing you from using a 4 pole generator with a small gasoline engine, but you'd need a higher horsepower unit to handle the lower rpms. ",

If you have a hand-cranked generator, first crank it with nothing attached, then with a light bulb or something similar attached to the circuit. There's a highly noticeable difference in effort needed. I remember seeing this in high school and it being a demonstration of the idea \"you can't get something for nothing\". \n\nThe same principle is used in regenerative braking in electric cars. It's basically a dynamo attached to the wheels, and when the brake pedal is pressed, a circuit is connected that immediately makes it harder for the wheels to turn because they are now charging the battery at the same time, which slows them down. \n\nIf this happens to a generator attached to a turbine in a power station (the load increases) then the turbine will turn slightly slower, decreasing the grid frequency. You can see the fluctuations on the National Grid site among others I think.  ",

Frequency can only increased if the generators actually speed back up to 60Hz through increased torque applied to the rotors.\n\nThe grid acts like a mechanical rotating shaft, rotating at 60Hz. when you add more load to the shaft, the rotation will slow, so the generators/engine will need provide more power to maintain 60Hz. If the generator/engine doesn't provide more power, the system will find a new steady state at a lower frequency where the generation/load is balanced. Reducing a systems frequency reduces the systems power demand until a new balance is found. If the load doesn't reduce (which can happen for certain types of load) the system will collapse.",

The first is by using mechanical energy (water, steam etc..) to spin a shaft/rotor. Then by using DC electricity to produce an electromagnet on the rotor.\n\nThe mechanical energy spins the electromagnet (the rotor) which generates electricity in the stator. The mechanical energy used will change the speed of the generator and the current in the DC system will increase or decrease the generators voltage.\n\nBefore you connect a generator to the grid, you want to frequency and voltage to match the grids (think of dropping the clutch in a car, the better your engine is matched to the speed of the shaft, the smoother the connection).\n\nIf the frequency and voltage are matched perfectly, when the generator connects to the grid, nothing happens, no current flows, the generator is in a state we call \"speed no load\". At this point if we increase the mechanical energy we will start to export electrical power into the grid. If we reduce the mechanical energy, we will actually start using electrical power to spin the generator, called 'motoring'. (this can be done on purpose in 'pump storage' to bring water back into the dams reservoir).\n\nIf the DC current creating the electromagnet in the rotor is increased the generator will then start to output VARS into the system (reactive power), which supports the system voltage (exactly what a capacitor bank would do), and if we lower the DC current, the generator starts to take VARs from the system to produce the electromagnet.\n\nSo a condenser is basically a synchronous motor that using electrical power from the grid to spin the rotor, while providing a strong electromagnet which produces VARs for the system support the voltage. \n",

Throughout the day, demand changes, so generation has to constantly adjust (ramp up/down, bring on or take out units) to keep this matched. The frequency is directly the result of the units generating power at a specific rpm; for example a generator must run at 3600 rpm to maintain 60 Hz, and the generator converts mechanical power to electrical power directly. The more load on the system, the harder the generator is to turn, so it has to work harder to maintain that 3600rpm. Likewise if it's got less load, it will be easier to turn. Changes in the system (both gradual and instant) need to be accounted for, and the rotating inertia of the network of spinning generators helps keep our 60 Hz at exactly 60.00 by working very hard (and manual correction a few times per month). \n\nThink of this- the less rotating mass that we have online, the less resiliency the grid has to absorb frequency deviations (caused by things tripping offline; again, generator trips results in a lower frequency, and a line trip may result in a higher frequency). Things connected to the grid can be seriously damaged as they were designed to operate on 60.00 Hz-- electric motors cannot sufficiently cool themselves if frequency goes too low (as a motor is a giant electromagnet, which is essentially a dead short at low frequency), and electronic equipment can be damaged on high frequency (as solid state devices do not like changes in frequency). \n\nThis is something that *must* be kept in mind as we retire more and more spinning units and replace them with DC generation (solar photovoltaic and wind). They will not be there to arrest frequency decay if we need them...\n\n\nedit: double negative",

In the Eastern Interconnection, we keep track of the time error and enter what is called \"Time Error Correction.\" When it reaches +/- 10 seconds, the entire Interconnection enters either fast or slow time correction by changing the frequency schedules to 59.98 or 60.02. Time error schedules run for full hour increments. As the error approaches zero, the time error monitor (currently ISO New England I think) will declare an end time at the top of the hour. We don't necessarily get it to zero, just close. \n\nTime error in the west is a little different. All the grid operators in the east or west have a responsibility to meet the load inside their footprint. We use an error measurement called ACE (Area Control Error). This is a measurement of how close you are to perfect balance between load and generation. The goal is to maintain a zero ACE. \n\nAnyway, in the Western Interconnection, every hour they figure out the error each operator has caused and assign them a modifier to their ACE to correct the error back to zero. This modifier is calculated by each operator themselves and the operation is pretty much automated. I could have erred slightly in this western mechanism, I work on the Eastern Interconnection. The broad strokes should be accurate though. \n\nSource: Am a NERC certified reliability coordinator and operate the electric grid. ",

This is less true now than it was 40 years ago (digital power systems can do it with little loss), but they can still lose a significant amount of energy (energy loss = higher failure rate, since you have a component dissipating heat).  Where this matters less is long-distance transmission lines; these can jump to frequency and voltage ranges that are more efficient at long distances, so the conversion loss is offset by potentially larger transmission losses.\n\nPoint is, huge swaths of the US electrically vibrate, not just all at 60 Hz, but a near-simultaneous 60 Hz.  It's really an interesting thing to think about.",

Too much generation going off the grid leads to large scale blackouts as in 2014( again, iirc).\n\nI don't believe there are clocks depending on grid frequency accuracy in India.",

                            "comment": "It's also a big issue in professional audio. If two devices are on different circuits, it can introduce something called a ground loop. Basically, a ground loop is what happens when two devices are on a common ground, but via different ground paths. So if, for instance, you plug one device in at one side of the room, and plug another device in at the other side of the room. Then run an analog audio signal between them. So if I plug my sound board in at my Front of House mixing location, and use powered speakers on the stage, for instance. Both of the devices will \"fight\" to control the ground, and it will produce an audible 60Hz hum in your speakers.\n\nWe get around this in a couple of different ways. The first (and cheapest,) way is to use something called a ground lift. Basically, you put it on the offending device, and it allows the signal to pass through while interrupting the ground's continuity - It lifts the ground. This eliminates the buzz, because now (as far as the analog signal is concerned,) you only have one grounded device on the signal chain. The other way is to use a digital signal, like fiber optic or Ethernet.\n\nAlternatively, we can prevent the issue altogether by making sure our devices aren't sharing ground anywhere. Either they're plugged in at the same place, (like on a power strip,) or they're on a completely different circuit.\n\nIt can also cause issues when we run cables - If there is an unbalanced signal somewhere, (like a quarter inch cable from a guitar, or a headphone cable from a laptop/phone/ipad/etc,) that is running next to a power cable with a heavy load, you'll actually be able to *hear* the power cable sitting next to the audio cable - When power runs through a cable, the push-pull of a 60Hz AC will produce an electromagnetic field, which unbalanced cables will pick up on. \n\nWe can get around this in a few ways. First off, we can shield the cable - This basically just means we sheath the cable in an extra wrap or lattice of metal. Then we connect that sheath to the ground wire. Just like with a faraday cage. This will try and direct any incoming EM interference to the ground. However, strong EM signals can still get through. \n\nWe can also balance the signal. An unbalanced cable, like a guitar plug, will only need two internal wires. A balanced cable will use three - Two signal carrier wires, and a common ground. An unbalanced signal will simply send the signal down the cable. Any interference that gets picked up along the path will be heard, because there's no way for the unbalanced cable to cancel out that signal. A balanced cable gets around this by using two copies of the same signal - One copy is sent like normal. The other copy is inverted, and then sent. So, while the first copy is going \"push pull push pull\" the second copy is going \"pull push pull push\". Basically, think back to high school algebra, and plotting waves on a graph - When you invert a wave, it will cancel out the original wave. Everything that the original signal is doing, the inverted signal is doing the exact opposite. Like adding 10 and -10 together. Under perfect conditions, the two waves will produce perfect silence... \n\nSo why would you want to do this? Because both signal cables will pick up the *same* interference as they travel. So now you have identical interference on both the regular and inverted signals. All you need to do is invert the inverted signal again, (essentially, you *un*invert it,) and add it to the original signal. Now you have identical signals that add together... And since both wires picked up the same interference, the positive interference on the second (inverted) signal just got inverted. Remember how a wave added to its invert will produce silence? The (now inverted) interference on the second signal cancels out the interference on the first when you add them together.",

Nowadays it only comes up in odd situations (like when Fukushima knocked out a chunk of the east's generating capacity) because virtually all consumer electrical goods are compatible with both 50Hz and 60Hz. (There are also three converting stations but their capacity isn't huge.)",

It's not a SPICE-grade simulation or anything, but will give you an idea. \n\nYou can scroll in and out if it doesn't show everything.  1\u03a9 resistors are there because the sim doesn't like infinite current across superconductors. You can use the sim speed slider in the upper right to make it go faster, but be warned that it is CPU hungry.\n\nThere are 3 scopes: \n\n* Voltage (green) and current (yellow) at the generator. The product of the two is the load on the generator, in Watts.\n* Current on the transmission line\n* Voltage/Current through the load\n\nYou can click the switches to simulate putting different frequencies on the line. By default, the 50 Hz signal is connected in parallel with the 60 Hz signal.\n\nThe scope in the middle shows what happens on the transmission line between 2 \"generators\". You can also watch the scope on the left to see the load on the main generator. When all of the generation frequencies match, you'll only see 5A on the transmission line (because it's 5V through 1\u03a9). \n\n[Things get nasty when you start connecting generators to the grid when frequencies aren't matched](http://i.imgur.com/Apnhpqr.png), and current (and load on the generator) triples as the generators \"fight\" each other. With mismatching loads and/or voltages in the real world, this would be much more unpredictable.\n\nThere are circuit protection devices in place to keep things from actually exploding and catching fire, but it's generally frowned upon anyway. It will cost someone somewhere time, money, and probably sanity. Frequency monitoring of existing installations is important for the same reason. If frequency drifts, you have the same problem. If a generator or segment goes offline for any reason (maintenance, etc.), it has to be synchronized *exactly* (voltage, frequency, phase angle, and phase order in the case of new construction) before feeding the rest of the grid.",

That's why our stoves and dryer outlets can work with that funky 220v plug. Europe went with 50hz later, because it was easier to calculate with metric standards.",

Things like clocks actually would not work on the new power grids as their time was kept electrically. And of course other appliances would not function optimally.\n\nMaybe that's worth googling or something.",

Then you could fairly reliably tune your \"A\" to the electrical hum instead of trying to ignore it or \"go up a smidge.\"\n\nOf course, choosing A at 440Hz is a relatively modern choice anyway. I guess it would be easier at this point for musicians to choose Bb @480Hz (or G @400Hz) as a new standard. Or have it depend on locale. Seems somehow culturally fitting that Americans would tune to Bb (common \"home base\" among a typical jazz horn section) and the rest of the world would tune to G, too.",

You can meter the 60 cycle hum via pitch!\n\nI wish the tuners had a little program note that recognized it and showed a new screen that acknowledged \"60 cycle hum\".  It could have a little graphic of a power pole with lightning bolts or something.  That would be more satisfying than watching the meter struggle to pick the note.",

There's a reason 3-phase is usually a different certification level for electricians. Another major problem is that 3-phase GFCI is a lot more complex (read: less safe) so more electrocutions would occur.\n\nIf we didn't have hundreds of millions of existing single phase installations *maybe* it would make sense to run residential on something like +48VDC for all lights (LED only), switches, small loads and electronics. High power devices would run on 3-phase VAC Delta connections for all motor and heater loads. \n\nWe'd get rid of every wall wart replacing them with tiny buck converters that would fit in most devices. While we were at it we could raise mains to 230V per phase to make better use of copper and make things like a 30 kW electric BBQ a serious possibility. ",

There are some old (bad) lightbulb designs that wildly whipped the filament around even at 60Hz.  Though I am confused, modern generators and transformers behave better at higher frequency.   I think the ones at the time didn't employ lamination and had severe eddy current problems at higher frequency.  This sounds like a very regrettable mistake to set it so low.\n\nMotor behavior were a secondary concern, it was not a strong application until after the 60Hz standard was established.\n",

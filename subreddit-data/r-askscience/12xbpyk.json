TEMPO, [which launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket earlier this month](https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-s-high-resolution-air-quality-control-instrument-launches), will monitor and report on levels of nitrogen dioxide, aerosols, and other pollutants several times a day.\n\nTEMPO is the first-ever space-based instrument to measure air pollution over North America and will transform the way scientists observe air quality from space. TEMPO's observations of pollutants will take place during daylight hours and will have incredible and unprecedented accuracy-down to four square miles.\n\nThis data will play an important role in how scientists study and analyze pollution, including studies of rush hour pollution, the potential for improved air quality alerts, the effects of lightning on ozone, how pollution spreads from forest fires and volcanoes, and even the effects of applying fertilizer.\n\nAsk us anything about TEMPO!\n\nWe are:\n\n+ Joseph Atkinson, Public Affairs Officer, NASA Langley Research Center - JA\n+ James Crawford, Senior Scientist for Atmospheric Chemistry, NASA Langley Research Center - JC\n+ Laura Judd, Research Scientist, NASA Langley Research Center - LJ\n+ Gonzalo Gonzalez, Physicist, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics - GG\n+ Xiong Liu, Physicist, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics - XL\n\nAsk us anything, including:\n\n+ What's in the air we breathe, from aerosols to oxygen and everything in between\n+ What air quality is, how we measure it, and why it's important\n+ How TEMPO will observe air quality over North America\n+ What data we're expecting to see from TEMPO's observations\n\nPROOF: https://twitter.com/NASA_Langley/status/1649503271059443738\n\nWe'll be online from 12:00 - 1:30 pm ET (1600-1730 UTC) to answer your questions.

Through the development of the TEMPO mission, numerous applications of the data have been identified through the science team and [the Early Adopters Program](https://weather.ndc.nasa.gov/tempo). One of those is the use of TEMPO data to identify disparities within communities related to air pollution with the goal of achieving environmental justice.\n\nIn recent research, satellite observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have been used to identify disparities in cities, in relation to fossil fuel combustion in cities, showing that higher emissions occur in low-income/non-white communities vs high-income/white communities. The key for satellite data in this type of application is to provide this data in high enough spatial resolution to \u2018see\u2019 the source that is causing these disparities. TEMPO data over North America will be the highest spatial resolution NO2 measurements ever recorded (\\~2.5 x 5 km), which gets down to the neighborhood scale.\n\nIn addition, TEMPO will be able to see how these emissions vary throughout the day.  I also know there are research efforts to expand beyond NO2 to other pollutants such as near-surface ozone. Therefore, TEMPO data can (and will) be integrated with information about community statistics (i.e. the US census) to provide those environmental justice maps.\n\nWhile TEMPO data is not available yet, NASA\u2019s Health and Air Quality Applied Sciences team has been working the last two years to integrate satellite data into environmental justice data portals.

Any chance this could become a worldwide project or used globally?\n\nI ask simply as an American living in South Korea, constantly choking on the air quality we live with on a daily basis. In comparison, the air quality in North America is paradise (usually aqi of 60 or less in most places). The usual aqi in Korea is generally 100-150 and on bad days, upwards of 250. The Pm 2.5 and Pm 10 particles are always high here which are known to be cancer causing. I'm sure you're aware of Asia's air problem but its gotten 10x worse in the last decade. \n\nI don't see South Korea (or China...where the wind blows from) doing much at all about it. I would be elated to know that Nasa is working on this for a global benefit. Now, if someone can invent a way to actually clean the air, we'd be set! I wish Nasa had answers for that specifically but I suppose I have to be realistic. Anyway, thanks for taking questions!",

It is impractical to measure everywhere on the ground. By contrast, a satellite can see everywhere (when clouds are not in the way), but imperfectly. For instance, the satellite observes the optical impacts of particle pollution (light scattering and absorption). \n\nSatellite observations must be interpreted to account for the relationship between particle abundance and optical impacts, as well as the vertical distribution of particle pollution above the ground. Thus, it is the combination of ground observation networks and satellites that offer the most value. \n\nIf satellite observations can be favorably compared to ground measurements, then the satellite observations can be extended to areas unmonitored by ground networks. This work is also aided by atmospheric models that ingest information from ground networks and satellites to better represent the distribution of particulate pollution (PM10 and PM2.5). - JC",

The value of the satellite imagery alone will help spur more attention to the problem. It is also anticipated that satellite distributions of pollutants will contribute to optimizing ground-based monitoring, attracting more resources to problem areas identified from space. Air quality forecasts will improve as TEMPO satellite data is used in air quality models.\n\nThe additional information from TEMPO will also assist state and local authorities in developing better pollution mitigation plans.

Once we obtain the TEMPO data, we want to make sure we can produce the baseline products meeting the measurement requirements first. Then we would like to use the TEMPO data to address the initial science questions when we proposed TEMPO:\n\n1. What are the temporal and spatial variations of emissions of gases and aerosols important for air quality and climate?\n2. How do physical, chemical, and dynamical processes determine tropospheric composition and air quality over scales ranging from urban to continental, diurnally to seasonally?\n3. How does air pollution drive climate forcing and how does climate change affect air quality on a continental scale?\n4. How can observations from space improve air quality forecasts and assessments for societal benefit?\n5. How does intercontinental transport affect air quality?\n6. How do episodic events, such as wildfires, dust outbreaks, and volcanic eruptions, affect atmospheric composition and air quality?\n\nAlthough TEMPO is primary a science mission, a TEMPO Early Adopters program, funded by NASA Applied Sciences, has been established and worked with us to broaden and enhance TEMPO applications with special attention to public health and air quality.\n\nMore than 300 early adopters including federal, state, and local air quality agencies, health organizations, non-profit organizations, and international partners have been trained with synthetic TEMPO data and are waiting to learn how to use TEMPO data for societal benefit. -XL",

The term used to describe that is column density, and the value will be given in molecules per square centimeter or Dobson Units. With some added information provided by models, as well as using multiple wavelength channels within the algorithms, some pollutants can be separated into sub-column amounts.\n\nThe primary products for TEMPO are NO2 tropospheric column densities, formaldehyde (CH2O) column density, and ozone profiles (near-surface, tropospheric, stratospheric).  NO2 and CH2O are proxies for emissions that are ingredients for chemically produced ozone and particulate matter.  All negatively affect human and environmental health. -LJ",

Most of the particle pollution (PM2.5) is also the result of condensation of gases to form these small particles. \n\nThe raw data provides us with pollutant distributions, but we still have the important task of using this information to understand the progression from emissions to poor air quality outcomes driven by chemistry and transport as compounds mix and evolve. -JC",

This is especially true for point sources, i.e., large stationary sources associated with industry or power generation. But there are also distributed \"area\" sources (traffic for example) and temporary sources (construction, wildfires, crop burning, etc.). This highlights the value of the temporal resolution of TEMPO. \n\nWhen looking at data with high horizontal resolution with great frequency, the changes observed (morning vs midday vs afternoon; weekday vs weekend, stagnant vs windy conditions, etc.) all provide valuable information on the pollution sources involved. Combining these satellite observations with models can help identify what we are getting right versus what might be missing. \n\nIn the end, we need high-fidelity representations in models so that we can predict how policy changes might improve air quality in the future. - JC",

Or is this phenomenon more of an optical effect of our eyes than how the atmosphere filters light? What can urban centres do to address/reduce light pollution?\n\n- How can we expect TEMPO and its data to help us develop/coordinate technologies for addressing atmospheric and space pollution(s) over the next five to ten years?

The brightness of the nighttime sky is directly related to energy use and our collective activities that light up the night. Some have used the intensity of night lights to indicate where polluting emissions occur. This is complicated by several factors. \n\nLight from traffic is co-located with the polluting source, while light from buildings, street lights, and other sources are remote from the power plants that provided the electricity. It is also difficult to know if lights are related to electricity powered by coal, natural gas, hydro, wind, or other sources, all of which have different polluting impacts. \n\nReducing the impact of light pollution can be done in two ways. One is to turn off unnecessary lights. Another is to promote greater use of window shades, shades on street lamps, and lower brightness to limit the amount of ambient light in urban skies. \n\nBTW\u2014the question is not entirely unrelated to TEMPO, which will be able to view night lights from space. -JC",

Ultimately, NASA is not a regulatory agency, so the best thing we can do in relation to the TEMPO mission is provide the best air quality data we can to those in position to make decisions. -JA",

Therefore, the satellite is always located in the same spot in location relative to North America. This altitude is \\~37,000 km above Earth's surface. While this is very far away, it is actually a benefit, because this means we can measure the same location multiple times in a short time period (nominally once an hour over greater North America). \n\nOne of the biggest challenges with satellite air pollution data is that clouds mask our ability to \"see\" the pollution. More measurements in a day will enable more chances for us to see between clouds. Even with this distance, the satellite is still going to get adequate signal:noise to provide data products at high enough quality to match or even exceed previous satellite measurements. Timescales of most air quality events are on the order of hours rather than days, so it is exciting that we will be able to see pollution from this perspective. -LJ",

            "comment": "There's more than one problem to solve for this to be a viable treatment. The problem is not only 'Can we regrow teeth from stem cells?', we already know that that might be possible. But how do we get the tooth bud safely and predictably in just the right spot so that the tooth grows in straight and functional and not crooked? What if there's not enough bone in the site were we want to regrow the tooth? How long will it eventually take from tooth loss to fully regrown tooth? How expensive is this going to be? How will the tooth look, will it need a crown right away to function properly and blend in esthetically with the other teeth?\n\nI think we might be able to see the first regrown human tooth in the next 10-15 years. But it won't be viable in a clinical setting for a long, long time, and even then it will be a super high-end treatment option and not easily accessible for anyone. Right now, an implant (which is the gold standard treatment for lost teeth) will cost you about 3000-5000 USD, it will take about 3-6 months from start to finish and by now it's a very predictable and proven treatment option. An implant however is not a perfect replacement of a natural tooth, it comes with its own risks and disadvantages, but it's the best we have right now. Surely, a regrown tooth would be better than an implant in some regards but it would have to outperform implants in more than one category to become the new gold standard. They would be prohibitively expensive, they would only be available in very specialized clinics (as opposed to implants which are placed in many regular dental offices across the globe) and it'll probably take longer too. So don't expect any miracles soon.",

Many revolve around the fact that we aren't a fetus in a sort of \"suspended animation\" being fed through our navel with everything developing together.\n\nThe tooth would have to grow into the jaw in situ so that takes a good amount of time.  In the meantime we have to eat so you have to protect the developing tooth from biting forces and all of the bacteria in the mouth.  For a living tooth you have to wait for blood vessel and nerve growth, two things I assume would require seeding it with some sort of growth factors.  \n\nHow would the roots develop into the bone? Normally they grow together but here the jaw is already developed so do you cut channels into the bone?  Would it grow into the bone somehow?\n\nEven if you could grow teeth in a lab you'd still need a way to grow and implant a living one unless you want a dead tooth.  You'd still need roots to hold it in, heal, grow vessels and nerves, etc.",

Very simplified, a developing tooth is basically a small sack of liquid that slowly hardens into the shape of a tooth, with the two major hard tissues growing in opposite directions (enamel grows outward, dentin grows inward). The whole process takes years from tooth bud to fully developed tooth, and it happens while the tooth is still unerupted. So I see no chance of this ever happening, or it being feasible in any way. It's always easier to place a filling in 30 minutes than to wait months for the tissue to grow back. We do need to work on filling materials though, right now we're working with non-ideal materials, making a few compromises.",

However, the efficacy of this methodology is questionable, since studies have shown poor cell survival, engraftment, and unpredictable differentiation in vivo.42 The potential efficacy of stem cell delivery and differentiation may be improved with the adoption of tissue-engineered scaffolds for cell delivery and structural support. Delivery of dental stem cells can potentially be supported by scaffolds that provide both mechanical and molecular (GF, integrin receptor engagement) cues for differentiation. HA is a naturally occurring mineral form of calcium apatite; it can be coated onto implants and prosthesis to promote osteointegration.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3842883/",

If you, a senior at a large dental or other medical company, develop something that replaces their ongoing income flow with a magic one-time fix product, no matter how expensive it will be at first, you're going to struggle to have management commit to it. Only when, say, a small player has a wealthy fan bankrolling all the work/losses, and a chance to usurp the incumbents, are you likely to get a proper chance to progress. Something like the Gates Foundation or Elon or Bezos taking an interest or a massive prize fund like an X Prize. Otherwise we'll probably need to wait until pure science almost entirely solves the problems all by itself, then either the incumbents or new players will rush to finalise a marketable product, to beat their competitors who will all be doing the same.",

None of that is cheap to begin with so while maybe in the distant future we will be able to do something like that, it being available and anywhere near cost effective is not on the table imo.",

But oftentimes, when prepping a tooth for a crown, people go sub-gingival in preparation for 1)aesthetics 2)because so much crown structure has been lost, which is why a crown is needed in the first place. The margin between the crown and the root serves as a place where bacteria/food/etc. can become trapped and leads to plaque/caries.\n\nThere is no interface between the crown (usually some type of ceramic nowadays, often zirconia for posterior or e-max in the anterior) and the tooth structure. That's why cement is used to retain the crown. In an implant, the bone will grow \"into\" the titanium screw, a process called osseointegration. That does no happen with crowns because your tooth is no longer growing.\n\nYour link shows that people with crowns have a higher prevalence of periodontitis compared to those without crowns. Regardless of sex stratification, having a crown increases your risk for the reasons I mentioned above.",

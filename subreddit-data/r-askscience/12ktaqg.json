            "comment": "Native aluminium [does exist on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_aluminium), though it's very, very rare. It's not clear to me at least that this rarity is due to biogenic oxygen the way native iron is, though - pure aluminium doesn't rust like iron does, and it just gets a transparent hard oxide layer on the outside. In fact, the aluminium you interact with on a regular basis is already coated in this oxide layer. So the fact that it's almost exclusively found in compounds in minerals is likely due to geological processes rather than biological, as I understand it.",

            "comment": "While aluminum is a pretty common element on Earth, it does not exist in its native form. Almost all aluminum is in the form of an ore such as bauxite, aluminosilicates, and other minerals. Aluminum just loves oxygen too much to exist in a pure form. As for the Cyanobacteria, the oxygen they produced already existed on the planet. The oxygen liberated by Cyanobacteria generally comes from carbon dioxide.",

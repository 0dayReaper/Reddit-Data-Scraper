Specifically, as discussed by papers like [Davies et al., 2021](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/228/1/316/6355447), in their words, \"Cooling of the liquid core leads to freezing at Earth\u2019s centre and the growth of the solid inner core, which provides additional power to the dynamo through release of latent heat and gravitational energy\" and they in turn point to thermodynamic simulations that demonstrate this (e.g., [Gubbins et al., 2004](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/157/3/1407/2110839)). Details of core geodynamics as it relates to the magnetic field is a bit out of my specialty, so I'll leave further discussion/explanation to folks with more domain experience, but it's not as though the articles presenting this data do not discuss the mechanism at all.",

                    "comment": "That quoted line summarises it quite nicely really. Convection is great for dynamo action as not only does it provide the kinds of turbulent motion that is great for inducing magnetic field, but it acts as an energy source. Prior to any freezing of species one would imagine the fluid to be well mixed and essentially only a single phase homogeneous fluid. For a single phase single composition fluid convective instability sets in under the Schwarzschild criterion which essentially says that the instability sets in when the temperature gradient is larger than the adiabatic gradient (the temperature gradient at fixed entropy, we fix the entropy as temperature is a function of density and pressure and so mathematically the gradient is a partial derivative). In physical terms the way I think of this is there is an amount of heat a static fluid can transport through conduction, but if the amount of heat the system is trying to push through the fluid is above this amount then instability sets in, the convection then transports the heat by physically moving it. \n\nIf the fluid also has compositional gradient then we fall under the Ledoux criterion for convective instability and it is easier for convection to set in. This is known as compositional convection or double-diffusive convection. Mathematically the compositional gradient is subtracted from the adiabatic thus lowering the actual temperature gradient required to onset the convective instability. The best way to physically understand this is through parcel arguments which really require figures so instead I will refer to [Pascal Garauds excellent lecture notes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08072) which are more related to astro than geo. The result will be more efficient heat transport and more energy available for dynamo action. \n\nAnother process is two phase fluids which is the freezing out of material. This I know a lot less about as I am more concerned with starts than terrestrial planets but I am in the same boat as the rest of the fluids community in this regard as even the hydrodynamic (no magnetic field) problem has only recently begun to be properly worked on. \nIn simplistic terms it can be thought of in a similar way to compositional convection in the sense that it provides an extra source of energy that can power the dynamo.\n\nThe bottom line is, convection is a natural way of producing a dynamo and stronger convection will lead to a stronger dynamo. Thus any mechanism which can aid convection or act as a source of energy/entropy will be beneficial for dynamo.",

In a way in that scale gravitation and electromagnetism are the only meaningful forces, but forces (or rather interactions) called strong interaction and weak interaction can have pretty drastic local effects (these forces only work on very short distances, i.e. atomic and subatomic level) that can then affect the things on larger scale.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model\n\nNote: my knowledge here is bit rusty (pre observed Higgs boson) and elementary level.",

So if you find certain rocks of a certain age you can use them to get information about Earth's magnetic field at the time.\n\nFor volcanic rock, this is because molten rock is too hot to be magnetic. As it solidifies and cools below a certain critical temperature (its [Curie temperature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curie_temperature)), any magnetic minerals will retain the magnetic field of their environment, and so these rocks preserve information about the strength and direction of the geomagnetic field when they formed. This is the same principle by which [bar magnets are created](https://youtu.be/qed4ynPYVIA).\n\nThere are also several ways that sedimentary rocks can end up with a \"fossil\" magnetic field. The study of these phenomena is called [paleomagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleomagnetism).",

I had no idea that it fluctuated.\n\nI think what you are looking for is the theory of geodynamo, which is referred to in the article you shared:\n\n\"Earth\u2019s magnetic field is generated in its outer core, where swirling liquid iron causes electric currents, driving a phenomenon called the geodynamo that produces the magnetic field.  \n\"Because of the magnetic field\u2019s relationship to Earth\u2019s core, scientists have been trying for decades to determine how Earth\u2019s magnetic field and core have changed throughout our planet\u2019s history. They cannot directly measure the magnetic field due to the location and extreme temperatures of materials in the core. Fortunately, minerals that rise to Earth\u2019s surface contain tiny magnetic particles that lock in the direction and intensity of the magnetic field at the time the minerals cool from their molten state.\"\n\nhttps://websites.pmc.ucsc.edu/\\~glatz/geodynamo.html",

The sources i have seen say we think it acts like a plastic toward the bottom of the crust but we dont know a lot of the composition in most areas unless there is a volcano, but even that can be missleading because not all magma is the same composition either. And even when you hear people say 'The core is iron, thats why we have the field', well Iron has a curie point which means at 1420 F / 770 C it loses its magnetic properties. Its wild how little we know or care about the planet we live on.",

I have done most of my searching using youtube/google searchs/and wikipedia (I know it gets a lot of crap but its a decent non acedemic resource)). What I meant about its composition is that it isn't uniform, what the composition in one area may be completely different in another area. We havent even been able to get samples from the mantle yet (Apart from lava) even the Kola super deep borehole is 12,262 meters, the crust is 40 kilometers. On top of that, we know that the magnetic field and even gravity is different in different parts of the world, which would indicate that composition and density varies.

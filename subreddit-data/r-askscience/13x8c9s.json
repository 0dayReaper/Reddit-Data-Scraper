They told me that based on my anatomy that my right one would be easier to transplant. \n\nInterestingly, taking the right kidney means they have to cut an extra incision for the laparoscopic surgery. Usually it's just 3 (two for the instruments, one larger one by the belly button to pull the kidney out). But for the right kidney, they cut a fourth. The purpose of that one is to use an extra instrument for lifting the liver, because the right kidney is hiding behind it!",

But there's a wide range of current level that's good enough to give a kidney.\n\n  - Work with your doctor to monitor your creatine levels (they indicate kidney health) during your annual checkups\n\n\nThere are some risks, but they're small. The good thing is that after you give a kidney, you're near the top of the list to receive one if you ever need one.",

[This picture](https://teachmesurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Renal-Transplant-Annotated.jpg.webp) shows the kidneys in their natural place as you\u2019d see them when face-to-face with someone, and the two ways they can be implanted (labeled A &amp; B). As you can see, the left kidney (on the right in the image) has a longer renal vein than the right kidney, since it must cross over the midline to reach the inferior vena cava (large vertical vein, in case you don\u2019t know), which lies on the right side of the body.\n\nVeins are much harder to suture and connect than arteries. Veins are thinner and have a much thinner muscular layer, and have a consistency closer to wet paper compared to the rubber tube consistency of arteries. The longer vein makes it easier to connect up during the implantation procedure. This assumes that anatomy is otherwise normal; if any of the vessels (ureter isn\u2019t technically a vessel, but also counts) are duplicated, that might prompt a right kidney to be taken instead, but it typically comes down to which one would be easier to implant.\n\nDisclaimer: I haven\u2019t yet completed my general surgery training, nor have I gone through my time on our transplant service yet, so my hands-on experience is minimal. I will still defer to those further trained than me.",

If it's something called a splenule, very common btw, they can be developmental or occur after some type of trauma if a part of the spleen ruptures off the main organ and maintains blood supply. We see it pretty frequently in CTs, which are almost always obtained for non related reasons (every once in a while it's to evaluate if the splenule is a cancer in someone who has a history of some abdominal cancer). It's common enough that I rarely mention them on my reports since it just causes confusion and concern for patients and is of \"dubious clinical significance\". Wouldn't consider them vestigial though, since they have blood supply and functional tissue.\n\nAlso yeah, first do no harm. Aka if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",

It lays itself to accomplish a functional goal (\"Get a system of pipes that gets blood from A to B\"). The fact we tend to be laid out so similar is due to an easy way that tends to be used to solve that problem of A to B, not because your fetal body read Netter anatomy and wanted to replicate it. You'll notice that exact forearm vein placement varies widely between individuals, for example.\n\nSome anatomical \"variants\" are so rare, problematic, or clearly screw-ups that they get labelled congenital defects (e.g. horseshoe kidney). Others are so benign and common that they just get called \"normal variants.\" Vessel-like structures (arteries, veins, bile ducts, thoracic ducts, etc.) tend to fall into the latter camp of normal variants. So it tends to go with renal vessels. \n\nThe picture in the anatomy book is just one variant. It's usually the most common, but sometimes for reasons of simplicity or historical holdover, so-called \"variants\" are even more common than the de-facto standard you learn first. Knowing all these variants tends to only matter to anatomy-heavy specialties like radiologists and surgeons, because from a functional standpoint, the exact variant doesn't tend to affect much.",

When I had my surgery, everything was done laparoscopically EXCEPT the removal of my kidney, which was done through about a 7 inch incision that started above my belly button (went around it) and down to the top of my pants line. The surgeon said this is the preferred way as to provide enough space to remove the organ without damage. Pulling a diseased organ through a laparoscopic incision is less concerning because it will just be disposed of. A kidney for donation needs to be treated gently to ensure it doesn\u2019t get damaged before transplant. This is just my experience, though, so other surgeons might do it differently.",

There has been evidence on the success of implant on same-vs.-opposite sides, and to my knowledge there\u2019s no functional difference. The reason opposite-side implant is done is one of operative convenience. The ureter lies at the back (posterior) side of the kidney, which artery/vein overlying. If you imagine flipping the kidney about the vertical axis, you end up with the ureter now forward (anterior) of the arteries/nerves, which eases the difficult process of attaching the donor ureter to the recipient bladder.\n\nAs that picture in my main comment showed, they are also placed in the pelvis, not in the original spot where the recipient\u2019s (now-failed) kidneys are. Removing recipients\u2019 failed kidneys and/or putting the new kidneys where the failed ones went is risky while providing no real benefit.\n\nThus, left kidney is the preferred harvest from the donor, and opposite side pelvis of the recipient is preferred site for implant, making a left kidney into the right pelvis the most typical choice.",

Not for transplant specifically (as I haven't seen much of transplant at all), but I've done a lot of time with vascular surgery, so I'm familiar with vascular anastomoses in general (anastomosis = general term for surgically creating a connecting hole between two tubular or hollow structures).\n\nThe typical suture used for vascular anastomosis is Prolene, a brand name for a monofilament suture made of polypropylene plastic (think of monofilament vs. braided suture just like the smooth plastic dental floss vs. rougher braided floss). This smooth suture glides through it's hole in the vessel easier, whereas a rougher braided suture would be more prone to snag and tear at the tissue (which can be advantageous in some cases, like in suturing skin, which is far less delicate).\n\nSmall-diameter suture with more close-packed stitches are used to spread pressure, instead of concentrating the pulling/tearing force at one hole.\n\nThe needle on the end of the suture thread is circular and comes to a point (like a sharpened pencil, called \"taper-point\"), as opposed to the the \"cutting\" type needles used on tougher tissue, which are triangular like a bayonet with sharpened edges. That circular needle won't create little cuts in the vessel that a tugged suture thread can easily enlarge, and that nice circular hole seals better around the thread to minimize leaks when the vessel is under pressure again.\n\nWhen throwing suture through the two vessels, the so-called [\"parachute technique\"](https://andreaslazaris.gr/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/B9780702044816000236_f23-05-9780702044816.jpg) is often used (at least among vascular folks). The suture isn't pulled tight (and the vessels aren't pulled tight together) until *all* the sutures have been thrown. This helps visibility (especially in tight spaces) and ensures that the pulling is dispersed through all of the suture holes more evenly, rather then tugging on each hole individually after each throw of suture.\n\nThe last--but arguably most important--technique thing I'll mention is that of a \"tension-free anastomosis,\" meaning neither of the vessels should have to stretch to reach the intersection (think of like a power cord that you have to stretch taut to just barely reach the outlet). This yanks on those sutures risking tears, or can cause ischemia. This need for a healthy amount of slack on your anastomosis site is a big part of why that longer left renal vein is advantageous: the vein is especially friable and prone to tearing if under tension.\n\nEven after all this, once fully tightened down and blood is allowed to flow through under pressure, it's still not uncommon to see pinpoint leaks through the tiny gaps between suture throws, or even leaks through the holes where the thread is passing. Any of several hemostatic products can be applied to the spot bleeding (often in the form of cotton- or fleece-like pads, and can even be soaked in clot proteins to kickstart hemostasis).",

                            "comment": "Has to do with the specific functions of arteries vs. veins, beyond the obvious carrying blood away vs. toward the heart.\n\n**Arteries contain much more pressure than veins.**  \nNormal arterial BP ranges (very) roughly 10-20% above atmospheric, transiently pops up to 20-25% above atmospheric with exercise, and need to be able to not immediately pop like a balloon if BP gets into the mid-30% above atmospheric (which would be bad, but at least not immediately fatal from a rupture). Contrast this with veins, where normal pressure is under 1% above atmo, and getting up in the 1.5-2% would be getting to be concerningly high.  \nArteries have a thick layer of smooth muscle and elastic fibers to resist this pressure, whereas veins have almost no muscle because they don't need the reinforcement for pressure. If you've ever seen an A-V fistula for dialysis, that's what happens when you directly connect a vein to arterial pressures.\n\n**Arteries have to constrict &amp; dilate when needed**  \nThose muscles in arteries are controlled by chemicals like adrenaline, causing them to constrict and relax bases on BP. This is one of the main determinants of blood pressure (along with heart rate &amp; pumping force). In addition to this going on body-wide to regulate, you can also constrict flow to some areas while allowing open flow elsewhere, as the situation demands. This allows you to divert blood to muscles and away from your intestines when exercising, then do the reverse after a meal while your bowel needs extra bloodflow to digest. Veins have very little of this function as a general rule, so have little-to-no musculature around them.\n\n**Veins pool a lot of slow-moving blood at low pressure**  \nThey need to be an easily distensible storage bladder to do so., which thick muscle would hinder. Furthermore, the degree to which they constrict/dilate on command to regulate flow/pressure is negligible compared to arteries.\n\nThe presence/absence of this muscle/elastic fibers is what gives arteries and veins their characteristic consistencies.",

Is this a good or bad thing, or does it serve some purpose? I wonder if this is related to when arteries constrict/dilate to get more/less blood going somewhere\u2013 resulting in more/less blood flowing out from organs (or wherever...) and thus pooling in the veins, since they don't have the same muscles to send that excess blood elsewhere.",

Even if you made a vacuum with no charge you would have to use an electric field to make the vacuum inside have no charge therefore there would always be an electric field.  \n\nIs that a flawed understanding?\n\nIs an ideal vacuum a theoretical or mathematical concept that is technically impossible in our understanding of physics? \n\nThank you for any clarification, I think I have a good idea of high school level math + a high level of modern physics concepts so ELI16?",

You could argue that zero is the strength of the existing field, but that's just semantics. In practice you won't achieve a field strength of *exactly* zero, of course, but that's just an experimental limit.",

This is above highschool level but the wuick answer is that, using maxwells equations, you find the the electric potential inside such a cage is exactly 0 no matter what  charges there may be outside the cage. And since the electric field is the gradient of the potential (again, sorry if that's too advanced for you) it is also 0.",

Therefore, if you have a perfect vacuum, there is no matter to disrupt. But, a high enough voltage could still create electron-positron pairs out of the vacuum and therefore make a conductor in something empty. It's called schwinger effect. It is only a prediction of quantum electrodynamics.\n\nSo if there is nothing there, electricity could pass through when \"matter\" (here electron and positron) are created in it.",

The prolonged (in the case of men) or increased (in the case of peri or post menopausal women, or women with PCOS) engagement of testosterone causes the thickening/lengthening/darkening of hair which is normally incredibly fine or hard to see. The hair follicles are not new, it's just that the hairs were so fine and/or light that they weren't noticeable before.",

Essentially, what happens in androgen-related baldness (male pattern baldness) is that the testosterone which signals your hair follicles to thicken and grow will eventually kinda \u201cburn out\u201d the most sensitive ones and cause them to mniatureize. The genetic susceptibility to it is mostly just about how sensitive your follicles are to DHT (an androgen produced endogenously from testosterone), though the specific mechanism is more complicated than that, involving things like the way in which your body handles the development and maintenance of  vascularity in your scalp.",

To a degree, there is something of a \u201cburn out\u201d effect and toxicity for the follicle which degrades it over time, resulting in the hair ultimately miniaturizing and becoming more colorless. Aside from that damage (which we don\u2019t perfectly understand the overall role of), there\u2019s the decrease in blood flow to the scalp as this process occurs. The blood supply to the follicle decreases from the influence of the hormones as well as the diminished follicle, and this is a problem for any hair growth in general. That vasculature will not easily be brought back once it has atrophied for a long time (like several years). And that is also something that naturally occurs as you get older, and is partially responsible for how our hair changes as we age (again, only partially). \n\nSo, like almost anything, it is really very much more complicated than what can be communicated easily to the general population. And treating those simplified models as definitive truth will give wrong answers outside of some of their direct connections. My explanation was even super simplified, and still leaves a lot of other things out.",

That principle of mildly and acutely inflaming tissue to promote blood vessel growth is the reason why dermal rollers exist.

Even if you were to go on estrogen hormone therapy, you wouldn\u2019t regrow everything lost to androgenic alopecia from many years past (though anything that could regrow, would regrow).\n\nEdit: spelling/grammar",

Caucasians have the highest serious AGA proportions. \n\nnot a slight against you, I am an Asian dealing with hairloss. I used to think \"nah it's fine, people don't have symmetric hairline anyway (they don't).\" Looking back, there were signs. Once it became obvious, you start overthinking \"what could have started this?\" \n\nit's not as easy to conclude relationship between the two, because you cannot randomly assign baldness to your participants. you can only observe. This is often obfuscated because balding men, when they bald, they start to work out to get in shape because they don't want to look like Homer Simpson. \n\nSo it comes down to \"balding men exercise more, but are they balding because they exercise or are they exercising more vigorously because they want to get in shape?\" \n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5500728/\n\nI like to think no, because circulating DHT does not matter as much as androgen receptor counts in our head and face. In my case my mother's side also dealt with adult acne. \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9496234/\n\nSome new treatments proposed are now targeting these receptors than suppressing the whole DHT.",

If you nuke your testosterone (like I've done and replaced it with estrogen), then you shouldn't experience male pattern baldness. You can get a similar effect by blocking DHT formation with Finnasteride, which generally isn't going to have a bunch of unwanted side effects for cis men. If you do have normal DHT though, you probably will experience some male pattern baldness, but when it happens and how much is going to vary person to person. There are probably some people who just never experience male pattern baldness because of genetics too.",

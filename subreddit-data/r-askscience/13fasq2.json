What was their logic/reasoning behind their methods? \n\nFor example if we mix a batch of bread dough too warm, we know the dough will ferment quickly because bacteria are more active in warmer environments. If a baker mixed dough too warm in 1820, what did he think was happening?",

            "comment": "I know a little bit about this oddly because of studying the lore of alchemy.\n___\n**TL;DR**: We only need an explanation for fermentation via microbes because we assume everything is lifeless until proven otherwise, but ancient peoples didn't assume this. The way they understood the world assumed that everything was alive and imbued with spirit until proven otherwise, and the spontaneous fermentation or decay of foods appeared to them to be the evidence of this.\n___\nThe Swiss alchemist Paracelsus (Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim) who lived in the Renaissance period didn't think of fermentation as being carried out by organisms that were alive, but thought of living things as carrying out fermentation in their various organs. Digestion, the bodily functions, etc. were thought of as your organs all doing some kind of fermentation. Fermentation and distillation were cutting edge technology in those days, and just as analogies are made between our brains and computers nowadays, in his day, analogies were made between various human organs and bodily processes and fermentation. (With regards to some aspects of digestion, this wasn't too far off, since our guts have an entire microbiome that co-exists with us. Our gut microbiome literally ferments the fiber in our food to provide us with certain beneficial compounds like butyric acid and propionic acid, while others make us gassy, and make us fart out gases produced during their fermentation. It's not hard to see where the inspiration for this concept came from.) **EDIT**: For example, pregnancy was thought to be a fermentation process where the mother's womb fermented the semen of the father, thereby converting it into a baby. **/EDIT**\n\nAs far as I understand of his concept of what was going on, fermentation was a natural transmutation of substances: gases were produced from wet solids, and sugar was turned into alcohol, or in the case of lactic acid fermentation, sugars were turned into acids. All of this was mediated by a living substance, though they didn't necessarily understand the mechanism nor that there were individual cells of yeast or bacteria doing the work, or even mold in mold-fermented meats and cheeses such as salami or brie.\n\nAnd the substances that did the fermenting inherited something from their ancestors, and separate \"cultures\" could thus be preserved in order to propagate fermentation with the qualities that they exhibited. In the human sense of the term, culture is what we inherit from our society that shapes how we do things and what sorts of things we do. This same term got applied to fermenting substances such as leaven because each lineage of yeast or starter dough or whatever continues to do what its ancestors did, each with its own 'cultural' characteristics, which we perceive as the flavors characteristic of each lineage of wine or beer yeast, or yogurt or cheese culture, or sour dough starter.\n\nIn the same way, our term 'spirits', in reference to alcohol, comes from this period's view of fermentation. When you ferment, the foaming bubbling ferment was referred to as the 'body' of the ferment. When you boiled it, you killed the 'body' (which would not ferment after being removed from boil, and was thus dead), and the vapors that came off of the boil were thought of as the 'spirit' of the ferment as it departed the dead body. This spirit was what they believed they were condensing when they distilled alcoholic ferments into hard liquor. This is why the term used to refer to distilled alcohols is 'spirits'. This is also why concentrated alcohol was referred to as [*aqua vitae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_vitae), the water of life, because it was believed the life of the ferment was captured in the distillate. And each type of thing you ferment had its own character, its 'spirit'/aether, which was thought to be the essence of the thing, just as a person's spirit was a sort of essence of the person. It was thought that this 'spirit'/aether of an animal or person or substance or thing was the 'fifth element', after the other four classical elements that were thought to compose all things\u2014air, water, earth, and fire. That is why we have the term 'quintessence', coined by the French alchemist Jean de Roquetaillade. 'Quint' means five, and 'essence' means element. The quintessence of something was that thing that gave the substances of a thing its essential character\u2014the 'spirit' of that thing. In alchemical lore, this was conflated with highly concentrated alcohol produced by repeated distillations. The alchemical way to capture quintessence is to do seven sequential distillations (usually of an alcoholic ferment), after which you would supposedly have the purest of the pure essence of the thing you're extracting. To this day, when you distill out the fragrances of plants, these distillates are referred to as 'essential oils', meaning the oils that contain the essence of a plant, its characteristic 'element'.\n\nThe world view that the world was full of interconnected life, and was imbued with spirit, even to substances like leaven and fermenting dough, is called [*anima mundi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anima_mundi) (living world, world soul), and it informed the various ancient world views of the pre-scientific era. (And even today, you might be surprised at how many people operate with this world view. In Japan, a lot of people seem to operate under the *anima mundi* world view as part of the culture. For example, Marie Kondo thanking things for their service to pay respect before getting rid of them because they no longer spark joy when she tidies up the home of one of her clients is an example of viewing all things as alive and imbued with spirit, and therefore deserving of respect.)\n\nYou can see that yeast was recognized as a substance that grew and spread even in the way it is spoken of in the Bible, for example, [Matthew 13:33, 1 Corinthians 5:6-8, Galatians 5:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A33%2C+1+Corinthians+5%3A6-8%2C+Galatians+5%3A9&amp;version=CSB). But as far as I can discern, at least in Europe, where alchemy dominated the proto-scientific natural philosophy of the day had it that these substances carried out the processes of life, and were in some way \"alive\", and even had \"spirits\" in them.",

Alchemy, or fermentation, or something else?\n\n___\n\n**How fermentation preserves food:** ***One form of filth kills another form of filth***\n\nFermentation is best described as human intervention into a three way microbial war for the purpose of preserving food and enhancing its flavor. These are the three major combatants in this microbial war:\n\n* **Yeast**, which produce alcohol that kills bacteria and molds\n* **Bacteria**, which produce acids that kill molds and yeast\n* **Molds**, which produce digestive enzymes and antibiotics that kill yeast and bacteria\n\nThese three battle for supremacy over who gets to take over our food, and in the course of doing so, produce substances which fend off the colonization and growth of the others, particularly the decomposers. This microbial chemical warfare is memorably summarized by the observation that one form of filth kills another form of filth. What we do when we ferment is to make alliances with the microbe of our choice by creating conditions favorable to that particular kind of microbe so that they can take over our food; in exchange for letting them utilize some of the calories in the food, we utilize their natural defenses to ward off unwanted microbes that would decompose the food or cause food poisoning.\n\nIn some forms of fermentation, such as Kombucha (fermented tea), we ally ourselves with two classes of microbes at the same time\u2014bacteria and yeast. In others, such as Sake (Japanese rice wine), we switch sides midway through; in sake, mold is used to break down rice starch into fermentable sugars; then, the alliance with mold is broken as the moldy rice is mashed up to break up the mold structures; the mash subsequently liquefied and fermented with yeast, which convert the sugars into alcohol. For vinegar, yet another stage of fermentation is carried out where acetobacter bacteria are employed to convert alcohol (in low enough concentration that it won't kill bacteria) into acetic acid. In the case of rice wine vinegar, all three of the microbes are employed one after another. Many cured meats such as salami and cheeses such as brie are cured with penicillium mold, which colonize their outer surfaces and prevent the infiltration of harmful bacteria. Miso (fermented soy bean paste) is fermented with koji mold and preserved with salt. Sour cream and yogurt are fermented with various kinds of lactic acid bacteria and get their characteristic sourness from lactic acid and other flavorful acids.",

We interconnect with the rest of the planet and it\u2019s organisms in a way that proves we\u2019re just a normal, everyday part of it (though perhaps more destructive lately). \n\nHowever, our ability to guide other living things is extraordinary. This isn\u2019t just a symbiotic relationship like birds that eat ticks off my hairy back\u2026 we can\u2019t even see the organisms that we\u2019re controlling. We were controlling them before we knew that they existed. And whilst the microbes are tiny and seemingly simple, many of them have existed and will exist for a massive amount more time and in a lot more spaces than us - arguably more evolutionarily successful. \n\nWe\u2019ve become the boss of these bitches, and we do it all *just to eat nicer food* and get pissed",

Grape wine maxes at about 11-12%, so a 2:1 or 1:1 water dilution works for wine vinegar.",

For this reason, fermentation was more or less inevitable. There was almost certainly a couple of generations where people learned things the hard way, with deadly food poisoning, but eventually we figured out what kinds of microbes we want on what kinds of food. From there on out it was just a matter of refinement, guided by noting what interventions resulted in something tasting good and what resulted in food tasting bad.\n\nMold taking over your fruit is bad, but yeast taking over your fruit (particularly the juice) makes alcohol, which is rad. Bacteria taking over the same fruit is kinda gross, but in some cases it is kinda nice. (For example, balsamic vinegar is grape juice directly fermented with acetobacter.) Bacteria taking over meat is a recipe for stomach cramps, diarrhea, and death, but penicillin mold on dry cured meats seems to work great. Yeast growth on meat is just nasty.\n\nAll of this was made possible by lack of refrigeration and by persistent food scarcity. If we had not been compelled to deal with microbes by being forced to eat food that some microbe took over, we would never have discovered these things. I don't think anyone would ever have invented bread or beer or any of these other things if we had convenient preservatives and refrigeration. Nowadays, if something goes moldy, we toss it out. If you ever looked at bread fermenting, it looks downright nasty and smells unpleasant as well. The first bread that was ever made was probably someone returning to his gruel after having left it out too long, cussing at how nasty it looked as it was bubbling with yeast, and throwing it into the coals of his camp fire. The hot charcoal probably baked this into some sort of primitive naan that smelled and tasted far better than the fermenting gruel it was made from, so the guy started systematically doing it again, this time pouring the fermented gruel on hot rocks next to the fire rather than in the fire itself. And from there, likely in less than one human lifetime, primitive man would have modified his fire and hot rocks into an oven and started baking bread regularly.\n\nThis is how I imagine bread was invented. All of the great fermented foods were probably first invented by accident in some manner like this, without any true understanding of what the fermenting microbes were doing.",

But if you work with them and inhale their spores too much, they can cause lung problems.\n\nOur gut bacteria substantially overlap the bacteria that grow on our vegetables. They do not natively appear in our gut. We have to get our gut biome from our food.

A huge amount of attention was given to this, and this helped develop many of the highly specialized cheeses and alcohols in Europe.\n\nYou know how China has monks who spend every waking hour practicing kung fu when they're not praying and meditating? Europe had monks like that, but instead of doing kung fu, they were brewing beer and making distilled liquors, and much of this developed in the era when alchemy, fermentation, and distillation were the pinnacle of ~~science~~ natural philosophy. That's why we have things like Trappist beers and liquors like chartreuse and other monk-made alcohols.",

At some point, primitive man was going to end up eating rotten food. The ones that didn't get people violently sick were the ones people realized they should re-enforce, selecting these \"cultures\" of preferred modes of decay, and by trial and error, they found out how to make food rot the way they preferred. \n\nConsider sake. Someone at some point had moldy rice (with just the right kind of mold\u2014white koji) they didn't know what to do with, but couldn't throw it out because they'd starve. That dude may have tried to make porridge out of it to make moldy rice palatable, and found that it tasted sweet. Boiling it to make porridge killed the mold, and airborne yeast got into his porridge, and began to ferment the porridge when it was being stored, and as a starving dude, he had no choice but to try it, and behold: he got drunk.\n\nMaybe it happened this way. Just a series of happy accidents from a time when food was scarce. Now we live in an age of abundance, and if food gets moldy, we throw it out. We would never have invented bread and beer if we had refrigeration from the beginning. I don't think anybody would look at yesterday's gruel, bubbling and fermenting, and think \"I'm going to try that when the bubbling stops\" unless scarcity forced them to not waste anything.",

The problem is, it\u2019s the weakest of the fundamental interactions by many orders of magnitude.\n\n If you could take all the energy of the largest nuclear weapon ever detonated, the Tsar Bomba, and somehow (!) focus it to create a gravitational effect, you\u2019d get same gravitational effect as you would with just 2.7 kg of water, or any matter.\n\n That gives us the answer for how to concentrate the vast amounts of energy needed: matter with mass already does that for us, and it\u2019s everywhere, no need to mess around with huge radioactive explosions or whatever. \n\nBut, to generate the gravity of say the Moon, you need a mass the size of the Moon. It\u2019s as simple as that. The wonders waiting to be unlocked are already visible everywhere in the universe: moons orbiting planets, planets orbiting stars, stars orbiting galaxies.\n\nA simple way to visualize the weakness of gravity is to notice that a tiny magnet (or for that matter your arms) can overcome the gravity of the entire Earth, and pick up a piece of metal. Magnetism is on the order of 10 billion billion billion billion times stronger than gravity.",

That idea comes from a kind of mixing of Newtonian mechanics and GR. This is part of the reason that the idea of relativistic mass has been deprecated in physics. Kinetic energy does contribute to gravity - all energy does - but you can\u2019t take the effect you\u2019d see in straight line motion and apply it to a spinning object.\n\nBut, even if we ignore that, there are plenty of youtube videos showing real examples of the problem with the spinning idea, long before you get anywhere remotely close to the speed of light: the object will be destroyed by centrifugal force. The reason that happens is, again, because that force far exceeds gravity. The weakness of gravity is a fundamental constraint on its possible effects.\n\nFor gravity to be able to hold such a fast spinning object together, you need something like a neutron star: very massive and extremely dense, giving it correspondingly large gravity able to counteract the centrifugal force. The fastest spinning neutron star has a surface velocity close to a quarter of the speed of light. Which isn\u2019t enough to introduce very strong relativistic effects anyway.",

This stick would have been imbued with \u201cgood yeast\u201d. Also goes for the brewing vessel etc. There would\u2019ve been some religious affirmation about this.\n\nFor making salami (another type of fermentation), they used the same room, tools, etc, all which had \u201cgood germs\u201d in high quantities. Certain butchers grew famous for the best salami which was partly luck and partly controlling the environment to sustain the favourable germs.\n\nThey were basically farming microorganisms without realising it and artificial selection applies here.",

            "comment": "I can speak specifically about beer a little bit.  \n\nThe history there is quite old.  Some scholars even speculate that cultivation of cereals, (esp barley) actually began not for bread-baking, but rather for beer-brewing.   NB, that this is only speculation and most evidence suggests that people were using grains for both food and beverage when agriculture started to become a thing.   \n\nThe earliest material evidence we have for beer comes from neolithic Israel, from approximately 12,000 BC (Predating agriculture as far as we know).   Residue was discovered in the rock pits used for preparing the beer.  \n\nThe earliest written evidence comes from the Sumerians, which is quite famous as the first \"recipe\" for beer as well.  from ~1800 BCE, the \"Hymn to Ninkasi\" describes the process of beer making as actions of the goddess ninkasi.   \n\nIt seems reasonable to assume that early humans attributed something mystical or magical to fermentation; the work of spirits or gods.    That seems to be a human go-to.   \n\nThe Nordic people used to have totem sticks, which were used to stir the mash and wort in brewing.  These were passed down in the family from parent to child;  it was believed that the power to ensure a good brew was held within the stick itself.   Which ironically was actually sort of true, as the yeast would be transmitted to the wort from the stick, and vice versa, inoculating it with a yeast culture.   \n\nIt's important to note, people did not necessarily have a sense of what made fermentation happen, per se, only that it did.  It was basically a case of \"When we do this, that happens\".  Though they did have some understanding of ways to help ensure a good fermentation like the totem sticks, or using the same brewing vessels.  \n\nBy the middle ages, they were certainly inoculating new brews with young ale from old brews, even the actual yeast; or one should say, either the foam from an active fermentation, or the stuff that settles on the bottom of the vessel after fermentation calms down.  In medieval England, it was called \"godisgood\".  Later, they called it \"ale barm\", and it was used in a lot of things, such as bread-making, as well.   Again, note the reference to gods in that name; how it happens was still seen as a gift from the supernatural at that point.   \n\nThis was reinforced during the middle ages, when brewing of beer became more the purview of monks and specialized craftsmen, rather than a cottage industry dominated by women as it had previously been.   Then the method of brewing beer became a somewhat mysterious trade secret that was not freely shared (though of course in some parts it was still known, as homemade beer never entirely vanished in all of Europe).  \n\nBy the renaissance and certainly by the enlightenment, a more \"scientific\" understanding did emerge of fermentation.   I use quotations because they weren't using the scientific method per se, but they had begun using a more methodical and empirical approach to understanding why beer worked.   A dominant theory during this time was related to the Phlogiston, and how fermentation isolates it (And distillation concentrates it) from the plant material being fermented.   Phlogiston being the essence of flammability, according to that theory.   \n\nAnd since we're talking about the 17th century and onward, I should address the OP's question.   The discovery of bacteria actually occurred at the end of the 17th century.   The tiny little critters swimming around in pond water were first observed around that time by early microscopes.   Knowledge of their existence, however, did *not* translate to understanding of their role things such as spoilage, fermentation, and disease until much, much later; the late 19th century.    \n\nBut again, that doesn't mean people didn't have a sense of cause and effect.  I have seen 18th century pickle recipes that warn people to use a spoon or fork to remove the pickle from the jar, and not bare hands, as that would cause it to spoil.  They didn't really know why, but they knew it did happen.  \n\nFor fermentation of yeast to make beer (and etc), this was not understood as a microbial process until it was discovered by Louis Pasteur in the 1850's-60's.    Prior to that, there were still varying theories out there, including (still) the phlogiston.",

Certainly with regard to brewing, the author suggests that inoculation with yeast was a later and deliberate step in the brewing process. The means, however is not known (addition of bread dough, Nile water\u2026.) While the biological process may not have been understood, this suggests that brewers knew that some agent was needed to make beer. The fact that we don\u2019t understand what\u2019s happening doesn\u2019t mean that people can\u2019t develop sophisticated models to ensure repeatability. In other words bread and beer have been made on commercial scale for millennia. People knew how, if not why. Indeed we are still learning why food processes work: take the Swiss cheese industry. As hygiene improved the cheese lost its  holes. It turned out that hay dust is essential fo CO2 nucleation, and now it is manually introduced in minuscule amounts to ensure the right number of holes are created.",

One theory is that this led to some helpful superstitions, like thunderstorms being a bad omen, or only very few select people allowed in the cellars, or doing each step of the production by certain saint days (with the right temperatures and humidity). \n\nOften a small portion of existing wine was mixed with the new grapes to boot-start the right type of fermentation. \n\nThey also knew about the importance of cleanliness: Burning, smoking, taring and/or using sulphur or spirit on the vestiges and/or the wine were common practices. Often this was intertwined with Christian liturgical interpretations like using certain herbs for the smoking and doing it on certain festive days (which were not coincidently in just the right time of the year for this).",

This is a fairly slow process and doesn\u2019t result in as much biomass being produced as in the aerobic fermentation. Yeast then can go dormant and not die for quite some time. \n\nIn \u201clagered\u201d beer the yeast is effectively left in the beer to starve and in this starvation process it breaks down the complex carbohydrates that it didn\u2019t need to back in the day, creating a crisper beer. Usually killing of yeast (autolysis) is very undesirable and if stored at cool temperature the yeast is able to go dormant for months. In wine some sort of autolysis of yeast can produce pleasant flavours, but this is usually after years of storage. Yeast is a pretty hardy bacterium, and take that from someone who has literally tried to kill it haha.",

While they didn't have an understanding of microorganisms like bacteria, they observed and developed methods based on their empirical knowledge and practical experiences. Here are a few explanations and reasoning behind their methods:\n\n1. Spontaneous Generation: One widely held belief was the theory of spontaneous generation, which suggested that living organisms could arise spontaneously from non-living matter. People believed that fermentation was a natural and spontaneous process that occurred when certain conditions were met, such as warmth, moisture, and exposure to the air. They attributed the transformation of ingredients into fermented products to the inherent \"vital force\" or \"life force\" present in organic matter.\n\n2. Vitalism: Another concept related to spontaneous generation was the vitalist theory. Vitalism posited that living organisms possessed a unique life force or vital principle that enabled them to undergo certain transformations. People believed that this vital principle was responsible for the fermentation process, as the dough or liquid seemed to come alive and change in the presence of warmth and other conditions.\n\n3. Chemical Reactions: Some individuals understood that the process of fermentation involved a chemical reaction of some sort, although they didn't have a clear understanding of the specific mechanisms. They recognized that certain ingredients, such as yeast or sourdough starters, were necessary to initiate fermentation, and they employed methods to preserve and propagate these \"fermentation agents.\" They might have associated fermentation with the breakdown of complex organic compounds into simpler ones, leading to the release of gas (carbon dioxide) and the creation of distinct flavors.",

            "comment": "Not much to explain really. Things dont last forever. Bread go bad in couple of days if not stored below ground, then few more days. \n\nWhy does it go bad? Why wouldnt it? Everything else goes bad. \n\nIf something lasts 4 days on ground level but lasts 8 days in a cellar, its pretty simple that cold food go bad slower than non-cold. \n\nIf you use dough thats too warm in bakery, the fermentation already started, if you try to bake with that, it will fail. \n\nI dont know for certain, but im 99% sure they knew from trial and error. \n\nIf you knew nothing, except how to make bread, wouldnt you try to improve it?",

This is 0.015%, compared to the 0.65% of the general population who are currently getting infected each week. This would suggest an efficacy of around 95% as claimed by Pfizer. None of the 20 were hospitalised. \n\nThe effect after a single dose is significantly smaller (and apparently less than Pfizer was claiming), though it still reduces infections by around a third. \n\nOverall infections among over 60s have dropped very significantly compared to the rest of the (still mostly unvaccinated) population. This has coincided with the British virus variant becoming more widespread in Israel, leading to an increase in infections among younger people.",

Pfizer's data is that immunity\\* after 1 dose does not start until 12 days, and that by the time the second dose is given (21 days), immunity is at 52%.\n\nThe data reported from Israel was that after 14 days, shortly after immunity starts at all, but long before the second dose, it is already at 33%. This does NOT contradict the data from Pfizer. We'll know more after Israel and others publish more data.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\*immunity from severe symptoms.",

                            "comment": "That's actually also wrongly reported. The efficacy rate of 52% comes from comparing infections in the vaccine and control groups **from the first dose to the second**, which includes the first 12 days where antibodies haven't kicked in yet. If you look at the Pfeizer data and ignore those first 12 days, you'd get around 90% efficacy from the first dose alone.\n\nSee Figure 3 here:\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577\n\nThe reason I think this is reported wrong, is probably to encourage people to get the second dose (as it probably ensures longer immunity).",

That's how their post sounded to me but is not what the paper says. The 52% in the paper came from comparing the proportion of people infected in the vaccine group to the placebo group; people that got the vaccine were less likely to contract the virus than people that got the placebo at that time point. That's all that figure says.\n\nI'm not sure what everyone else is talking about with herd immunity and all, that has nothing to do with what the researchers are doing. They're just controlling for variables as required for these kinds of studies. Presumably something happening in the vaccination process, going to the hospital/doctor for the study, the fact that study participants are always generally more health conscious, etc might make people more or less likely to get the virus so to control for that you have to compare between people in the study. And you can't use any sort of historical data, especially now, because we know that there are different more transmissible covid variants, more people are infected or have been infected overall compared to the past, etc.\n\nYou might know all this already, I just wanted to point out I don't think that they are trying to say anything about herd immunity.\n\nEDIT: Grammar/clarity",

It is very simple. Constraints may cause that number to deviate slightly but it is a good ballpark number in terms of the general percentage of population that needs inoculation.\n\nNow, it's becoming clear that in real-world constraints 88% of Americans will generally not be vaccinated. So, you are correct: even once we have sufficient supply, herd immunity may not be something we can count on. But come on, we can talk about it like adults instead of scolding each other for even thinking about it.",

With measles, the R0 is about 15, it's a very highly infectious disease in that you can catch it by merely being in a room after someone with measles has been in there a while. This means that the immunity % needs to be far higher. Covid has an R0 rate of between 2 and 3 ish (from memory without looking it up) which means using the herd immunity formula you need a lower % of immune people in a population for herd immunity to work :)",

It does also give an increase of 5% to effective immunity. \n\nHowever the issue is people not being aware that the first dose essentially takes 2 weeks to kick in. You aren't immediately safe. If you look at the graph it almost seems to do nothing at all in those first 2 weeks. People need to be aware of the delay",

Probably I was too young to remember, I only have a vague recollection of doing a vaccine shot once in school and another time because it actually gave me a nasty side effect.    \n\nFun anecdote time: all my life i had this vague memory of getting a vaccine shot when I was very very young, and being completely unable to move one of my legs for a couple of days after that (and I remember it kinda scared the shit out of me at the time, as you can imagine, but somehow I don't remember my parents being fazed by it at all). I actually asked my parents a few months ago if I was making this up, and they say that it did happen, although they're not sure anymore what the problem was, just that it looked scary but was not a big deal. My father says most likely it had nothing to do with the vaccine itself but was probably the result of the needle hitting a nerve, and leaving my ass and leg so aching that I couldn't move it much.        \n\nAnyway, thanks all for the explanation!",

Clinical trials wouldn't be done yet with a longer timing between.\n\nSo we don't know much for sure. We know the vaccine is effective after a certain period of time, but we don't know how long that immunity lasts, either from getting the disease or from the vaccine, since it just hasn't been around all that long.",

They gave doses three weeks apart, right? And the immunity response from the first dose is supposed to ramp up over a couple of weeks. So you have a very limited time frame to look at for when the first dose would be 'active' in people, but the second dose not yet given. Most of the time between the doses is time when the immune system activity from dose 1 has not yet kicked in.\n\nYou really need a good population size that delays the second dose for 6+ weeks after the first dose, to properly see the effect of just one dose.",

For example, how many people after one dose decide they're protected enough to start taking risks? As a hypothetical example, imagine the vaccine has a 60% reduction in chance of infection ceteris parabis. However, also imagine that before their first dose, most people weren't eating at restaurants, and it turns out avoiding restaurants roughly halves someone's chances of getting an infection. If enough people got the first dose and then decided, \"Well, I'm somewhat protected now, must be safe to go out and eat at restaurants,\" it could result in an infection rate that looks a lot like a reduction of a third.\n\nThat's not very clear but hopefully you can figure out what I mean. I tried writing it out twice and I can't think of how to say it any better.",

Note that if the comment above you is correct, then the final efficacy estimate of the vaccine (95%) is not different from the real world efficacy, just the (MUCh rougher) estimates of the between dose immunity. Pfizer didn't make any strong claims about immunity after the first dose, they've always stressed that two doses are needed. IIRC the estimates of ~50% efficacy from the first dose were for three weeks after the first dose. So the real life data we're seeing might not be different than the trial data.",

If you look at their kapplan-myer like curves for time since first dose &amp; covid rate, you don't actually see any difference until at least 10 days after the first dose. This is presumably attributable to the fact that an anamnestic response takes \\~14 days to launch, so no vaccine would actually be effective before that. So if you filter the results for only those that got the first dose 2 weeks ago, I'm sure the single dose is actually much more effective that just using the raw post-single dose numbers. Everyone who got the second dose however has obviously had the first dose long enough to launch an appropriate secondary response, so those numbers are in line with advertised",

The vaccine's impact will take weeks, if not a month or two, to start really showing up in national statistics.",

It was not possible to know for sure if they would have suffered worse symptoms without the vaccine.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNonetheless, Dr. Anat Ekka Zohar, who studied the data for Maccabi sees the data as very positive: \"This is very encouraging data... We will monitor these patients closely in order to examine if they continue to suffer from mild symptoms only and do not develop complications as a result of the virus.\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWith a small population and a regular supply of vaccine, Israel is following the Pfizer protocol of giving two doses of the vaccine three weeks apart. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe Pfizer clinical trials - which is all we had to base efficacy on until now - indicated a vaccine efficacy of 95% protection from 28 days after receiving the second dose.

    "postText": "How did humans evolve lactose intolerance (lose the ability to digest lactose in adulthood)?   \nI am not referring to how certain Eurasians, Africans, etc developed lactose tolerance in adulthood thousands of years ago. \n\nInstead, I am talking about how virtually all human babies are born lactose tolerant with the ability to product a lot of lactase enzymes to be able to drink and digest a lot of milk....but then a gene kicks in to turn off the lactase producing enzyme when they grow into older children/adults. Thus, I'm asking how and why the gene/traits/etc to turn off the lactase producing enzyme in adulthood evolved to create lactose intolerant adults when the default seems to be everyone starting out from a point of lactose tolerant babies.  \n\n\nI've tried to research this myself, but everything I've found talks about how humans developed lactose tolerance in adulthood rather than how babies lost lactose tolerance when transitioning into adulthood.",

The selection pressure is quite straight forward: Apart from modern humans basically no mammal consumes milk in adulthood. So there is essentially 0 benefit to producing lactase once you're an adult mammal. And producing lactase, just like producing any other protein, is a process that takes resources. It's not free.",

Lactase obviously did not evolve in early humans but in very early mammals many many millions of years ago since feeding milk to their young is the main defining characteristic for mammals. We are talking about many millions of years before non-avian dinosaurs went extinct. I also don't like the way you said \"to allow babies and adults alike to consume lactose\" because it sounds like you're implying evolution has a goal in mind and also because I highly doubt adult mammals ever consumed a significant amount of milk. I can't imagine a selection pressure for that, so I don't know why you assume that such a behavior was ever widespread in mammal populations. I don't think that's a necessary evolutionary step in mammal evolution.   \nThe restriction of lactase expression to early childhood probably also falls within that time period. Let me reiterate: we are talking about a time when there were still non-avian dinosaurs around, not about the time of early humans. I don't know why you are so fixated on the idea that this happened specifically in humans. Not producing lactase after weaning is how most mammal work, including all of our close relatives. This is not something that evolved in early humans but rather more than a hundred million years ago.",

This is very wasteful as they're producing an enzyme that they only use for the first portion of their life until the day they die.\n\nIt's fairly easy evolutionarily to have a checkpoint develop where the expression of a gene turns on or off, so fairly quickly these early mammals would have developed genetic mechanisms to turn off the lactase gene in adulthood. Even if it's not a giant advantage it is an advantage to not be wasting resources building an enzyme that does nothing.\n\nThis is the default for all mammals in the modern day. Lactose intolerance is the standard adult mammal condition. Humans are the odd one out in that many humans actually have lactase persistence. \n\nIt's also not that consuming lactose as an adult was counterproductive or bad, it's that the sugar is exceptionally rare in nature and the only place where you get enough of it for lactase to be a useful enzyme is in dairy. Milk hasn't been a regularly available resource to any adult animal at any point before humans.",

For any gene, whether it is on or off depends on what transcription factors are being produced in a given cell at a given time and on epigenetic control of the gene itself. There are all sorts of genes that are active during development but aren\u2019t required during adulthood. This kind of regulation isn\u2019t specific to lactase and there\u2019s no one gene that is responsible for it.  \n\nYou can read about what\u2019s known about the control of lactase expression specifically [here.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4899171/)",

This DNA mutation was more successful at reproducing itself in humans and spread to different populations across the world. \n\nTldr: Because lactose intolerance is the default among non-human adult mammals (as a general rule), we know that lactose tolerance is a mutation that humans evolved independently from other mammals.",

When drinking milk there is a benefit to it so there is selection pressure to keep producing lactase. When mammals reach a certain age, they no longer drink milk so there is only cost. This would create a selection pressure to stop producing it after a certain age. \n\nAs to why mammals stop drinking milk at a certain age? I would guess that came from the selection pressure favouring mothers being able to suckle a new child and increasing the number of offspring overriding the advantage to the individual child.",

At this point, the milk is mostly proteins and fats, with a minor component of oligosaccharides which mostly serve as a probiotic to promote the growth of good gut flora, and as a protective agent against bacterial toxins.  The production of these oligosaccharides also produces low levels of lactose in the milk, because it's an intermediate step in their production.\n\nNote that _also_ at this point, you probably start to see the beginnings of genetic regulation of gut development so that the infant gut is different from the gut of older mammals.  The infants are relying more and more on milk for food, which is different from whatever the adults are eating.  So their gut starts out focusing on that milk, then later adapts to an adult diet.  This might be small changes at first, since protein and fat rich milk is maybe at first similar to protein and fat rich bugs they were probably eating.\n\nNext, you have a process where oligosaccharide and sugar levels in milk increase, and infants start getting more and more energy from them.  In monotremes and marsupials, most of this energy comes from oligosaccherides themselves, which are brought into small intestine cells and digested.  I don't think much is known about how their ability to digest these changes as they mature into adulthood, but given the distinctiveness between the increasingly sugar-based  milk and the diet of adult marsupials and monotremes, there are likely substantial changes happening in their intestines around weaning. \n\nAt some point in the ancestry of placental mammals, they start expressing lactase enzyme from a subset of cells on the fringe of the small intestine.  Lactose levels in milk also rise a whole lot, from a minor component to a large component.   This is how placental mammal babies get a lot of their energy.\n\nNow, the key thing is that probably from the very start of lactase being produced, it was only produced in infants.  There's no way to know for sure, but it's reasonable.  The way it works is, some  cells in the lining of the intestine mature with the ability to produce lactase enzyme.  These cells are constantly being replaced, though, so if you stop making them anew you eventually run out of them.  And because lactase seems to be derived from preexisting enzymes that were present in infant mammal intestines to digest oligosaccharides, probably their gene expression just followed the  expression of those other genes...turned on in the gut of infants to handle the unusual diet infants consume, then no longer activated in cells that grow later on.  There is, after all, an existing genetic machinery to control changes in the gut (and the entire rest of the body) as a mammal matures from infant to adult.  It's not just loss of lactase, a ton of other stuff changes as well.  Hormone levels, growth, teeth loss and replacement, etc.  \n\nAt the very least, we know that no other adult mammals seem to be able to digest lactose, so if the ability was ever present at all, it must have disappeared a long, long time ago.  \n\n\nI pulled information from [This paper on milk](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/778414/1-s2.0-S1751731112X70617/1-s2.0-S1751731111001248/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHcaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJGMEQCIBsfyuYhb%2FRcWPoYBKr%2FzV2HfQJhM4%2Fp%2F8LI4iOI%2FqyxAiBh1YKOeJUT9Ff8edoQpomtCZ0gOarHYumzumaQVtkpHCq7BQjA%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F8BEAUaDDA1OTAwMzU0Njg2NSIMatquqwi1n8AkzoBGKo8FDxgeqNrxNOyQccfgupvmA6EcS1PJHcwRM9JlBe8HJhJnUD1eW55C7QnydeKJqj9%2BskLRuIzaKikZolAe1v6laCMe1KDemYj9KpFyAzg0J77LsCm3jjPm%2FJXQJMNU%2BgiRW%2FrznaTadFmTxUZ4OMMllP1mYb5N2%2BSxCO9%2BipYZiU9V7UXa2aarjOF1HsWKqPRvWysrqOBTwOJ8QMectm%2BQ1%2B860IBr8jUY0vE0BcFkadb6Gp0HzirCiLz53ssgmz0XmqQq15evKCv7lgKKw4AKyHwN9s9Fv2kUP7c9%2FKfoSrei5olz62T5Ot7YmXYSPcCNHk7Rkk1CGu2FUTK7xVauL4Ui5T6iGdgahcfK5XzhMEIgIj91tC45Aj1xV4dcE%2B2Tl8ON974gxYvP0h2OAEVGmaDJR9DV%2FrQ69Eqr1CvlHVEw%2F4dDUA%2FcolR8UN9npR36Vgyl5vNQvr88BGpefe%2BlPrzifQB7SQtQqwzIEcrhYgImTEjwSDUPKuIcUgg%2BpMAYOaMDWKmL5qGkR51zwg2%2BOjeVV91aFAa0sRIOwgtxzjRUgeylJzAjaBrrdK3I2PhH2LIvvja7JPMS1DFcuK6UWu2n7SWmDmPC48R7fxIGKprw0STE77wZa2rqCfB0WCKcSemcKODhYYBBhpvt9yViD3%2FECCasY9vcTu0f1aaHLhPZ3To36xfIzCj956Sr2dHgzloyKRcg7aYmoFKCU7VoksfjIrpqInzcefKWdhFYBeAHdwMsopED7wxz77izjoFDzIA2ySu5KlD89HE4RLFEm5QAzcM%2B0hy08nZb1xaIJS4A7yA%2BCM%2B0CYXz1Z6oplmcG99kyjHcwsqOeHyuT2l%2B9lqGDJv54BAe1%2Bo7rgH1TTCQvJekBjqyARUnLBZPUXKjChFZq%2FKox7ndVJDwbPjzchLXIJUn8V0vmvvG7LIst%2BXZMpLQ8jLzn%2FRcUGEKRlfJy9jl7tj0qnpN3N4VSAE8Z%2F3RHBs%2Byn7fYREbYDU7KWbjtOaM83tvuA5OuC8z0EFVfrv2zxRJnpRul6wbghgjgJv9SN3cQxDI%2B%2BCQkZd%2B24ZXUOeIHwf2x9jvwaagnvxePrIt5GupYkjLEX2%2F7P4EZ5SWPN18ZHqsmmM%3D&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20230611T152327Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=300&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY6PMUCDEN%2F20230611%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=f7dc1a3d3058d181d2d155f7efe436cf285eaac592d96e37483d21f18da0bb66&amp;hash=4293262a6d0d8cfabd6b8d9eec6c06df40a9601bf99f5c06a33304a84480fdcb&amp;host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&amp;pii=S1751731111001248&amp;tid=spdf-d131f3ba-06a5-479c-91c4-934eeda61004&amp;sid=8209585e9fe3d84d358bc5e3fea223cc14e7gxrqa&amp;type=client&amp;tsoh=d3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29t&amp;ua=1015520b510305040757&amp;rr=7d5adaf52e6196b4&amp;cc=us) and [This paper on lactose](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3184/003685005783238408).",

Most mammals lose the ability to produce the enzyme that breaks down lactose (I believe it's called \"Lactase\") after \"childhood\", which is when they stop relying on mother's milk.\n\nOnce humans figured out that we could drink milk as a food source, those who were mutated to tolerate it continued to utilize it, and in some cases thrived because of it, causing the mutated gene to spread. This is why many people of Asian ancestry are lactose intolerant; their culture doesn't drink milk, so the gene to tolerate it didn't do anyone any good, and it remained an uncommon expression of genes.\n\nAs a side note: Don't feed your cats milk or cream; they can't process it, and it will only give them an upset stomach. They might want it, because cats are drawn to proteins, but they don't know it will hurt them.",

Somehow, along the path of evolution of H. sapiens sapiens, those with access to herd animals for meat and milk (pastoral cultures) survived better if they developed a mutation on a gene(s) that suppressed the natural trigger for losing lactose tolerance after weaning age. Since being able to use milk and dairy products as food persisted into adulthood, those with the mutation were more likely to survive to the age of reproduction, and so passed along their genes more frequently than those who did not possess the mutation (and thus had fewer food options and were less likely to survive to reproductive age).\n\nSomething like that.",

So lactose intolerance is actually people that havent evolved the necessary ability to produce sufficient lactase :)\n\nYou're talking about the recent chain of events creating lactose tolerance while I am asking about a different earlier chain of events creating lactose in-tolerance.\n\nI am assuming the chain of events were as follows:\n\n1) First, mammals and all early humans evolved the ability to create a lot of lactase to digest lactose.  \n2) Then early humans evolved an additional trait that caused them to lose the ability to create a lot of lactase when they grow from babies into adults (eg. switch off the lactase producing genes).  \n3) More recently in the last several thousand years, some humans evolved another trait that caused them to continue to retain the ability to create a lot of lactase when they grow from babies into adults (eg. stop switching off the lactase producing gene). \n\nYou are talking about event #3 but I am actually talking about the much earlier event #2 when lactose-tolerance evolved among mammals but then was switched off in adulthood by the addition of another trait/gene.",

One of the many critters we get dosed by on the way out of the birth canal  (source: book Life Unfolding, and I Contain Multitudes)\n\nThere's a big concern that more babies are lactose intolerant these days because many mothers do not have  enough of these bacteria to dose them adequately, or due to C section (the second which can be fixed by swabbing the mom then baby) (I contain Multitudes).\n\nAs you get older these critters reduce in numbers, although in some tribes they last much longer... Delayed weaning time, breast feeding culture, and diet are factors. \n\nThe act of drinking baby food may have started as an act of desperation during hard times, or perhaps as a way to use more of the animal than just it's meat and hide.   From there, figuring out how to store, preserve and use it came about.  (The ancestors tale)",

I know more about the microbe side than the genetic side in this case.   The book I Contain Multitudes has an entire section about breast milk.  But it's been a while since I read it.   The truth is probably in the middle. With the biome most powerful when we are a baby and it tapers off over time as one weans. But many people consume milk  without a problem (albeit not at the rate or amount that a baby does)\n\n\n\nAnd one can be dosed as an adult with the microbes.  There is also pills you can take to offset the problems of intolerance too.  Cultures that breast feed longer, or have mothers that share breast feeding with each other (ie one can be 're infected' to an extent) also will retain their microbes as well for that period.  \n\nHOWEVER ones genetics does seem to play a role. They did gut microbes transplants and found that over time, the biomes 'returned' to their original mix.  So you could in theory dose yourself with them but it might not stick (I contain Multitudes)\n\nI suspect personally that the truth is a combination of both genetics and microbes (and we also inherit our microbiome from our mothers for the most part).  The system is incredibly complex and we discover new things all the time.",

It depends on several factors such as genetic lineage, culture and such \n\nFor example, a tribe of pastoralists who have drunk milk for thousands of years probably have a higher genetic tolerance, because those who can handle it would be healthier and produce more offspring  \n\nA people who delay weaning probably have a higher microbe tolerance, because the microbes are fed longer (ie the weaning basically cuts off the microbes food supply so population decreases)\n\nA culture that weans quickly and doesn't consume much dairy probably won't be very tolerant, because there's no genetic pressure to handle milk and no microbes needed.  Use it or lose it.\n\nModern society with all the added factors (donated milk, antibiotics, probiotics, more genetic mixing between groups previously isolated, new diets, caesarian) I think has been really throwing a lot of randomness into it, but studies into various urban vs rural vs... other groups are ongoing to undo the web.  It's COMPLICATED.  \n\n\nI heavily encourage I Contain Multitudes  for more details. I might go pick it up again myself to refresh my memory.",

What I learned in one of my anthropology and the environment classes in college was that most humans are born with the ability to digest their mothers milk. Eventually, they will no longer need that as a source of nutrition, and the enzymes produced to digest lactose stop.  \n\nHowever, there were nomadic groups of humans that would often traverse across large areas of land with their livestock who would graze on grasses whilst the humans heavily relied on the cattle for sustenance. One source being milk; one of their main sources of nutrition was blood letting where they would drink the cows blood in the milk in a way it didn\u2019t hurt the cow, that way they could get certain minerals and nutrients they couldn\u2019t obtain elsewhere.  \n\nAnyway, over time natural selection chose those who were more able to digest lactose as a means of survival, and that gene was then passed down to future generations.  \n\nIt\u2019s a very general and basic summary of that theory/idea, but I found it fascinating!",

In human evolution when agriculture was beginning and we stopped being hunters /gatherers, early humans in areas with traditionally low resources (think Scandinavia), mutated (or those who had the mutation survived) and were able to tolerate/digest lactose as adults. In resource-rich areas such as the Mediterranean, this mutation didn\u2019t have any advantage over not being able to digest it. So over generations, those who could get extra nutrients (mostly protein and fats) from animal milk were the survivors, and were able to pass their genes to their offspring.",

If it\u2019s still needed then it\u2019s still there.

            "comment": "This is not an answerable question because (1) this not how we actually characterize risk for earthquakes, (2) we are not able to reliably forecast specific ruptures to the point where we could give a probability, and (3) a lesser part of this is this is actually vague, i.e., are we thinking a whole margin rupture? a northern Cascadia rupture? a southern Cascadia rupture? a northern San Andreas + southern Cascadia rupture? etc. Toward that last point, we still can't give good probabilities of any of these events, but it highlights an additional aspect of the uncertainty here.\n\nWhat we can discuss is the probability that you might experience a specific amount of shaking and/or damage in your lifetime, in a given location. Specifically, we can consider a \"probabilistic seismic hazard assessment\", or PSHA, e.g., [this discussion of PSHAs](https://www.conservation.ca.gov/cgs/psha). If you browse through that, you'll see that these use a variety of data and simulations that go into determining the probabilities of specific outcomes. These are very much geared toward engineering goals, i.e., they're often cast as maps of something like the peak ground acceleration within a specific spectral range that has a specific probability of being exceeded in a given time frame. This is not particularly intuitive for the average person, but it's actually quite useful if you're trying to design a building that you want to last for X years in a given location and not kills its occupants. If we look at the most recent PSHA for the US as presented in this [paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/8755293019878199), we can see several versions of these types of maps (e.g., Figure 10). \n\nProbably more intuitive are versions of PSHA that are cast instead in terms of potential damage, often using something like the [Modified Mercalli Intensity scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Mercalli_intensity_scale). In that same paper, they provide probabilities that a given area will experience a specific intensity in Figure 14 within 50 years (which fits your time frame for the most part). The answer then depends a bit on where you live. Let's say you live in coastal Oregon, then within 50 years, you have a: \n\n* 50% chance of experiencing intensity IV (Light Shaking - Felt indoors by many, outdoors by few during the day: At night, some are awakened. Dishes, windows, and doors are disturbed; walls make cracking sounds. Sensations are like a heavy truck striking a building. Standing vehicles are rocked noticeably.\n* 10% chance of experiencing intensity VII (Very Strong - Damage is negligible in buildings of good design and construction; but slight to moderate in well-built ordinary structures; damage is considerable in poorly built or badly designed structures; some chimneys are broken. Noticed by motorists.)\n* 2% chance of experiencing intensity IX or greater (for IX - Violent Shaking - Damage is considerable in specially designed structures; well-designed frame structures are thrown off-kilter. Damage is great in substantial buildings, with partial collapse. Buildings are shifted off foundations. Liquefaction occurs. Underground pipes are broken. )\n\nImportantly though, you can see that this depends a lot on where you are. If you live in central/western Oregon or Washington, all of the intensities are lower at a given probability range. If you live in Seattle or the eastern Olympic Peninsula the intensities are higher for a given probability range. Also importantly, these do not reflect probabilities of specific earthquakes on specific faults. Now, if you're thinking about coastal Oregon and considering what's giving you that 2% chance of violent shaking, it's *probably* going to be related to a Cascadia event, but if we're thinking southern coastal Oregon, you might also be feeling shaking from an northern San Andreas rupture, or something along the [Mendocino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendocino_Fracture_Zone) or [Blanco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanco_Fracture_Zone) fracture zones/transforms offshore, etc. Similarly, if we're thinking of Seattle, again, Cascadia is one way to end up shaking, but so is the [Seattle Fault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Fault). The point is that while these maps fundamentally depend on identifying potential earthquake sources in their construction, the ending probabilities are large source agnostic (or at least reflect sums of probabilities from different sources) and cannot be strictly interpreted in terms of probabilities of a large event on a particular fault. \n\nFinally, we focus on these types of measures because this is what actually matters in terms of preparation, design, etc. There are lots of details of earthquakes (depth, directivity, distance, etc.) that control how much shaking an area might experience, along with [site effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismic_site_effects) which can make shaking more or less intense in an area. Thinking again of Seattle, the uniformly higher intensity of shaking at a given probability reflects not only that there might be more local earthquake sources (i.e., the Seattle Fault), but also that much of the area sits on sediments that will amplify shaking.",

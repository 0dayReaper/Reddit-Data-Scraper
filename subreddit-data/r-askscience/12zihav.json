I doubt you would call that \"seeing\" your hand though, just being more right than not that it was there is you guessed. And those photons need to be in the visible spectrum for our eyes to detect them though. In earth orbit there is clearly plenty of light for this to work since we can see on earth. Even much farther out in the solar system there are plenty of visible spectrum photons for us to see our hands in front of us. \n\nSo, deep space. The average photon density of the universe (which corresponds to deep space) is reasonably high at ~few hundred per cm^3, but the problem is most of those photons are not detectable by the human eye since they are not in the visible spectrum. I'm having trouble finding a good data source to get a better answer, but there's so little stuff in general in the universe that its likely close enough to pitch black in the darkest places in the universe (far from any galaxy) that it would be similar to being in a cave with little spots of light being distant galaxies. Your hand would be visible by blocking those pin-prinks of light",

But the analogy is not very good. The Earth is not heated from the centre. The heat comes from radioactive decay all over the Earth. The effective viscosity is also much much higher so the dynamics is different. The rigid plates on the surface also influence the pattern of flow, they don't just passively ride the flowing mantle. The sinking slabs at subduction zones contribute to driving the motion.",

                    "comment": "First, two big misconceptions/myths:\n\n1. While Earth's mantle flows slowly, it is overwhelmingly solid (think putty). The outer core is liquid, but that is not directly related to plate tectonics. The mantle and crust do contain some areas of partial melt (up to a few percent).\n\n(1a. Volcanoes aren't supplied from some ocean of magma, but rather localized magma chambers of partially solid 'crystal mush'. The melting point decreases with pressure. Magma is generated in the mantle and crust by hot rock flowing upward, which partially melts as it decompresses.)\n\n2. The plates aren't just passively being driven along by convection in the underlying mantle. The plates are an integral part of the convection.\n\n(Edit: 3. Not all, or even most, of Earth's heat is from radioactive decay. Roughly half of Earth's internal heat flow is from heat leftover from Earth's formation: the kinetic energy of the large objects that collided to form it, and the friction form dense iron sinking to form the core.)\n\nPlates are made of relatively rigid rock (as opposed to the flowing rock below), a layer called the lithosphere, which comprises both the crust and the uppermost part of the mantle. Immediately below the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, the relatively weak and low-viscosity layer that makes up the rest of the upper mantle.\n\nThe largest driving force in plate tectonics is slab pull. The subducting lithosphere (slab) pulls the plate along. The slab sinks because it is (a) compositionally denser than the continental crust it may be subducting under and (b) cooled so that it is denser than the surrounding/overlying rock of more similar composition. (Oceanic crust can subduct under younger, more buoyant oceanic crust, not just continents, and in any case has to sink through the weak asthenosphere.) When oceanic crust first forms from cooling magma at mid-ocean ridges, it is still relativley hot. It cools and contracts (becoming denser) as it age and spreads away from the ridge. The flow induced in the asthenosphere by the subducting slab exerts another driving force called slab suction, which accelerates the subducting and overriding plates.\n\nAnother, weaker, driving force in plate tectonics is ridge-push, but this is a misnomer. Magma upwelling at the ridge does not actively push the plate along. The young, hot lithosphere is buoyant, rising to form the ridge, but the seafloor gets deeper with the cooler lithosphere away from the ridge. Ridge-push is the lithosphere sliding downhill because of gravity. The buoyant magma passively upwells from the mantle as the newly made oceanic lithosphere moves away on either side.\n\nThere is viscous drag from the underlying flow acting along the entire base of the lithospheric plates. But this is much weaker than slab pull, which it tends to oppose.",

For a pot of water, I'm assuming that the dominant currents are created by a combination of the shape of the confined pot and the fact the heat is more concentrated at the center though. I'm curious what physical features or forces would cause such regular prevailing currents in something that's always illustrated in textbooks as a featureless uniform sphere.  What's so special about certain hot spots down at the core that causes hotter magma to constantly well up from there, and not from some other place?",

The same convection currents keep the earths mantle from boiling over. In the earths mantle the currents flow in patterns where hot mantle material flows from near the outer core, rises to the crust where it propels tectonic plates along, is gradually cooled by proximity to the crust and distance from the outer core, then sinks to be warmed all over again.",

But on the surface we've got things like mountain ranges, large bodies of heat-absorbing water etc. that cause those patterns of currents to form.  Are there geographical hot and cold spots or \"mountains\" in the earth's core that cause the currents of the core and mantle to keep flowing the way they do, or is it just the inertia of massive amounts of molten rock that keeps it going in such a predictable way?",

But this isn't true after you cross the threshold of the star's surface. When you are inside the star, the effect of gravity pulling you towards the center of the star decreases since there is less mass towards the center of the star. Note that this is not the same as pressure, the pressure will still be very intense, but gravity will be less so. The further into the star you go, the smaller the force of gravity, but the opposite will be true for a black hole since the density of a black hole is infinite. I.e. as you get closer a blackhole's center, the effect of gravity increases.\n\n[Stack exchange answer](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/18446/how-does-gravity-work-underground)",

We're still figuring out the big ones.\n\n\n&gt; If so, then according to mass conservation, a star's mass equals a black hole's mass, right? \n\nNot exactly, some of it usually gets blown out in the process that creates it, and some mass is carried away by energy in that process as well (including gravitational waves, which for mergers can be enough energy to amount to a substantial fraction of the original mass of the system).  But yea, they still obey conservation laws, it's just that not all of the mass will be *in the black hole once you're done*.  So if you read an article saying a 20 solar mass star left a 2 solar mass black hole, that's probably why.\n\n&gt; So then, if a black hole has enough mass to prevent any lightwaves from escaping, why don't stars?\n\nGravity depends on two things -- the amount of mass involved, and the distance between the mass.  Solar mass black holes aren't black holes because of their large mass, they're black holes because of their small radius. If you can somehow figure out how to get it to collapse to a small enough size, the Sun would become a black hole. Or the Earth. Or your pet hamster.  It's just that no natural processes cause that to happen to Earths or hamsters, but there are such processes for massive stars.",

Let's call the lever arm length \"R\". Assuming you have the same rotational speed regardless of your lever arm then we can translate your rotational motion to linear via (omega)x(R) = V, where omega is that rotational rate and V is your launch velocity. So the impact on your lever arm length is linear to your launch velocity:  **twice the lever arm results in twice the launch velocity**\n\nIgnoring air resistance and assuming you always release at the same angle, we now need to know how your launch velocity affects your throw distance. Some re-arranging of kinematics equations eventually yields that for a initial velocity V and launch angle (theta), the distance of a throw is equal to: (V^2 )xsin(2xTheta)/(g) where g is the acceleration due to gravity. So that means that **twice the launch velocity results in four times the distance thrown**\n\nPutting it all together your experiment seems correct! Ignoring air resistance and all other factors held constant, **Doubling a lever arm will result in a throw four times as far**",

                    "comment": "Oh! A question I can answer!\n\nBecause Mercury has a small magnetosphere (and almost non-existent atmosphere), it is highly sensitive to solar wind changes, and processes happen very quickly (sorry, my source for this is a book I own. But there are a lot of papers that mention it, like this one by [Slavin et al., 2014](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014JA020319)). This includes changes in the levels of plasma precipitation, which is when solar wind plasma impacts on the surface, and is the source of the exospheric sodium which then produces a tail. So the magnetosphere itself changes dramatically based on solar activity, and on very short timescales. \n\nThe sodium tail typically observed is neutral sodium, which is not as sensitive to solar wind changes. However, it does change with distance from the Sun (which, for Mercury, is effectively season) as shown in both ground-based data ([Baumgardner et al., 2008](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2007GL032337) and [Schmidt et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0019103509004333?via%3Dihub) are two of many paper discussing variability in the tail) and MESSENGER data ([Jasinski et al., 2021](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL092980)). So, if you consider distance from the sun/season as a type of \"solar activity\", then yes! In terms of solar cycle, it seems to be more complicated. Page 26 of [Millilo et al., 2020](https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1470767/FULLTEXT01.pdf) says that the scientific community is a bit divided on what the major driver of the neutral exosphere is (whether photons, plasma precipitation causing sputtering, thermal, etc). It's definitely a combination of all of them, so solar activity like CMEs does have an effect. The Millilo paper also contains a ton of citations to other papers if you'd like more info.\n\nUltimately, this may be something BepiColombo can help us understand. With two spacecraft, we will have multipoint measurements inside the planet's magnetosphere, which can tell us a lot about what processes are going on, and we will be able to observe both neutral and ionized sodium in situ.",

The heat \"rising\" is simply the surrounding air which gets heated around the sunlit surface, which dissipates the further it moves from the heated surface. The air above the canyon is simply cooler as it is as removed from the hot surface as possible.",

You can observe this by letting some air out of a car tire on a hot day and noting that the air comes out cold. Likewise when air is compressed, it heats up.\n\nSo places with higher elevation are colder simply because the air that moves there from lower elevations cools down in the process as it expands, and vice versa.\n\nIn addition there are local effects, such as the canyon trapping heat due to its shape.",

This additional dimension gives us a four-dimensional space called spacetime. \n\nEverything moves through spacetime at the speed of light. We aren\u2019t quite sure why, but we understand this to be true with Einstein\u2019s theories. The faster (and we\u2019re talking really much faster) an object moves through space, the slower it must move through time, so that it maintains the same speed through spacetime.\n\nIt helped me to think about a car that can only move at a constant speed, say 60 mph. The car is on an infinite 2d plane. The car can move North, East, or some combination of North and East, but still can only move at 60 mph. If the car is moving at 60mph North, it is not moving East at all, and vice versa. \n\nNow switch North with \u201cTime\u201d, and East with \u201cSpace\u201d. The car can only move at the speed of light (something like 300,000 km/s). So, it can move completely in the \u201cTime\u201d direction (like a photon would do in a vacuum) or completely in the \u201cSpace\u201d direction (or likely a combination of both). The more it moves through space, the less it moves through time. \n\nThat\u2019s Special Relativity (without explanations of observers and how it all depends on how you\u2019re actually viewing said car too).\n\nBut yeah, time as we understand today is just another axis that we move through. Only difference is that we can\u2019t move backwards through time.",

In order to accomplish this you would need something with negative mass. As far as we're aware, nothing has negative mass and there's no mechanism by which something could achieve it (there's no negative of the higgs mechanism, the thing that gives particles their mass).\n\nThere are some other ways in which it's technically possible in quantum theory, but not in any particularly useful way and again it seems to only be possible in the extremes that only math can really explore (in this case, using wormholes that we're fairly positive can't even happen in the first place).",

                    "comment": "There is no such force as gravity, basically. Gravity is distortion of spacetime caused by mass.\n\nThe problem that stands in the way of intuitive understanding of this is that we the humans can sense and understand the \"space\" part of the spacetime, but not really the \"time\" part - we only see the consequences of it, but not the \"time\" itself.\n\nIf you imagine yourself staying (floating) still in space for a split second near a massive object - you can say that you're not moving. That's only partially true, because you're indeed not moving in space, but you are at the same moment moving very fast through time. Now because the massive object distorts the spacetime, your path through the spacetime is not straight anymore, it is curved. \n\nThe closer it is to the massive object, the more is the curvature of the spacetime. Which means that at a larger distance from the object you move faster through time than at a closer distance. Which in turn means that your head is moving faster through time than your feet (if you're floating in space oriented in such a way that your feet are closer to the object than the head). So there's a gradient, a difference, in your speed through time between your feet and your head. \n\nProvided that your head is still attached to your feet via your body, this action causes your whole body to turn in time dimension towards space dimension and causes you to start gaining speed in space towards the massive object. \n\nIt's like when you're moving in a car in a straight line in a forward direction, and then suddenly left side of your car slows down compared to the right side - this will cause the car to turn and you won't be going straight forward anymore, you'll start turning to the left gaining speed in left-wise direction and losing speed in forward-wise direction. The same thing with moving through spacetime: when moving in curved spacetime near massive object, one part of you slows down in time dimension and \"turns you around\" in time causing you to gain speed towards the object in space dimension and lose the speed in time dimension.\n\nSome sci-pop channels on youtube that explain this without going into math:\n\nScience Asylum [https://youtu.be/F5PfjsPdBzg](https://youtu.be/F5PfjsPdBzg)\n\nPBS Space Time [https://youtu.be/UKxQTvqcpSg](https://youtu.be/UKxQTvqcpSg)",

                    "comment": "No, the inner core has definitely not reversed direction. Most of those headlines were extremely misleading, if not outright nonsense. The dynamo is also not generated by the inner core spinning within the outer core.\n\nThe inner core had generally been thought to be rotating *very slightly* faster than the overlying liquid outer core and solid mantle/crust, caused to do so by forces in the outer core (roughly analogous to a type of electric motor). This difference in rotational would amount to a few degrees per year at most--possibly much less. What the new paper argues, instead, is that the core oscillates between rotating slightly faster than and slightly slower than the outer core on a \\~70 year cycle, and is currently on the slower part of that cycle. The inner core always rotates eastwards, completing a rotation roughly every [23 hours and 56 minutes](https://www.google.com/search?q=sidereal+day+length&amp;oq=sidereal+day+length&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j0i22i30j0i15i22i30l2j0i22i30j0i390i650l4.2561j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8). Just according to this paper it is now doing so slightly slower than the rest of Earth--for example every 23 hours and 57 minutes. (Rotation involves acceleration, and so unlike linear velocity, is absolute. This cycle would be completely different from any geomagnetic reversals (\"pole flip\"), and is really only of academic interest.\n\nEarth's magnetic field is generated within the liquid outer core. Convection currents in the liquid iron-rich metal are twisted into columns as a result of Earth's rotation, and this motion of the electrically conductive fluid sustains the dynamo. (See [dynamo theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory).) Over the past \\~500-1500 million years since the inner core first formed, the gradual freezing of the outer core to grow the inner core has powered Earth's dynamo.\\* However, the inner core itself doesn't play an active role.\n\nEarth had a dynamo for most or all of its history, In general, a solid inner core isn't necessary for a rocky planet to have a dynamo. Dynamos of non-terrestrial bodies work via different mechanisms and in different materials, but in general there is some kind of motion (usually, but not necessarily, convection) of an electrically conductive fluid, which requires a source of energy (and entropy). For example, Jupiter's dynamo is generated by convection of the liquid metallic hydrogen that makes up the vast majority of its interior. (Whether Jupiter even has a solid(-ish), rock/metal core isn't clear, and if it does, there certainly isn't a clear transition point from liquid to solid.) Stellar magnetic fields are generated by convection in their hydrogen-helium plasma interiors.\n\n\\* Earth's outer core is mostly iron (and nickel), but contains some light elements such as oxygen, silicon, and hydrogen. These light elements preferentially (although not entirely) stay in the molten core instead of freezing out with the iron. As the inner core grows from the molten core freezing out, the concentration of light elements in the remaining melt gradually increases, at first near the inner/outer core boundary. The rising of buoyant light elements through the remaining liquid core is the main source of energy source (ultimately gravitational potential energy, released by a form of friction) that drives the convection to sustained Earth's dynamo since the inner core first formed. Latent heat released by the freezing itself is a minor contribution.",

The added objects have a density lower than Earth's average density, but we would compress the existing material a bit more. Let's assume Earth keeps its average density. The volume increases by 17% which means the radius increases by 5.4%. The required orbital velocity increases by 5.4%, too, from ~7.5 km/s to ~7.9 km/s. We also increase gravity losses, especially directly after take-off, but all rockets can still take off nicely with this slightly increased acceleration. Going to a low orbit on this larger Earth is still easier than e.g. reaching geostationary transfer orbit (~10 km/s), something many rockets routinely do.\n\nIf you add the mass of Venus (80% of Earth's mass) then some rockets couldn't take off any more while fully fueled and others would face significantly increased gravity losses. Some might still be able to reach orbit but you really want to redesign rockets at this point. If you also add Venus' atmosphere then no rocket will work.",

I did a bit of reading and it seems that Wolf-Rayet stars are much larger than the type that form planetary nebulae, but is the mechanism the same? \n\nMy (limited) understanding is: a smaller-mass star fuses mostly hydrogen in early life, starts fusing more and more helium and becomes a red giant. Then as the red giant starts running out of helium and fusing heavier elements that\u2019s when there is a lot more energy radiating from the core and that overcomes gravity and pushes the outer layers into a planetary nebula? Is that correct?\n\nIn a Wolf-Rayet star, is it the same mechanism of radiation &gt; gravity? But what drives the shift to when it starts losing mass?",

                    "comment": "AFAIK, the distinction is just the type of star that drives the winds, although there are probably differences in the composition of the winds. \n\nIn general the mechanism is the same, often referred to as \"line driven winds\": Absorption of photons by metals in the star. However the energy scale and composition is different, making the difference in the size of the clouds.\n\nIn general, planetary nebulae are made by stars of around 6-10 solar masses. These will make it off the main sequence of hydrogen burning, where they begin to burn helium. Helium then burns into carbon, and carbon into oxygen, making a Carbon-Oxygen core in the center of the star. Before Carbon/Oxygen ignites, the star contracts, and this contraction heats the star to the point where Helium in a layer just outside the core ignites, as well as a layer of Hydrogen outside of that. \nThis is called double shell burning or the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. During this period, the star becomes extremely luminous compared to the main sequence, and also a little unstable. The burning layers radiate away tons of photons, which are then absorbed onto \"metals\", usually Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen that have been dredged up from the core to the outer layers. Since photons contain momentum, this drives a wind off of the star. The instability caused by the double shell burning also results in pulsations in the star - this contributes hydrodynamically driven winds to the outflow as well.\n\nIn contrast, Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are still on the main sequence when they start driving mass loss. These stars are much more massive, with a lower limit of ~35 solar masses. This time there is no pulsations, and no requirements of dredge up from the core (which is mostly hydrogen). They drive winds simply because their luminosity is really large, meaning that any metals which are well mixed into the stars outer layers at the time of its formation will absorb the photons and cause the line driven winds. The amount of wind that gets driven is in general dependent on the metallicity of the star and its mass, which is correlated to its luminosity, and the escape velocity at the surface of the star. \n \nChapter 2 of Stellar Interiors by Hansen, Kawaler and Trimble gives a great overview of this stuff if you're interested in more.",

That's one of the reasons lithium ion batteries are so cheap and useful, because its light (low molar mass) and highly reactive (large redox energy). \n\n[Energy-density wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density#/media/File:Energy_density.svg)\n\nHere's an interesting article on different battery technologies that may be applicable when scaled up:\n\n[Alternative Energy Storage](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/01/renewable-energy-storage-innovations-batteries/)",

Like the way hydro plants sometimes use excess electricity to pump water back up into their reservoirs so it can be run through the turbines again.\n\n In theory you could drop massive weights into a mine shaft, running a generator as they fall, then hoist them back up when you want to store energy. But I don't know if dropping a ton of concrete 2000 meters underground is actually that much energy compared to the storage needs of a modern city.",

Basicially you need an indefinetely high burning point and a surounding temperarure of absolutely zero to have a efficiency of 100%. \n\nIn reality the surrounding temperature and the burning tenperature are not that far apart, wich results in a relativly low efficiency.",

A few of these likely stem from an impact with another planet like object at the beginning of the Earth's formation.

That stretching out is called redshift, and it is how we can measure the expansion.We do this by looking at the [absorption lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_line) from the light of our observed star, and measuring how far off they are from a theoretical \"0 redshift,\" thus giving you your expansion rate.There's more to it of course, and using different methods to independently measure the expansion gives us different numbers oddly enough. if you want to learn more about it search for \"the cosmological crisis\"",

So keep in mind that you're asking about the rotation of the earth around the sun, which is not necessarily dependent on the Earth's mass. Then you are specifically asking about a situation where youre bleeding off (or adding to) Earth's momentum around the sun, for instance by impacting it with an asteroid. That's a more complicated scenario than I'm prepared for haha. \n\nAdditionally, we'd need to move faster around the sun in order to lose the leap year, which I think would require less mass of the earth. Less mass (with the same velocity) would mean less momentum, and I think this would lead to the Earth being drawn closer to the sun and increasing the speed of Earth, leading to a potentially shorter year.

One year to accelerate, one year to cruise (which would suck because no gravity) and one year to decelerate.",

First, I will remove the acceleration (because general relatively is hard) and pretend that you travel away from earth at a constant rate for one and a half years. Then return at a constant rate for another year and a half for a total trip time of 3 years. This constant rate is very important to determining the relative time dilation. \n\nIf that rate is 0.9c then about 6.9 years will have passed on earth. \n\nIf that rate is 0.95c then about 9.6 years will have passed on earth.\n\nIf that rate is 0.99c then about 21 years will have passed on earth. \n\nIf that rate is 0.999c then about 67 years will have passed on earth. \n\nYou can find equations here:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation",

The top speed achieved will be 0.7748c. \n\nAnd if the crew wants to get home, they will need to turn around and do the back trip for another 3 years from their perspective and another 3.9565 years from the Earth's perspective.

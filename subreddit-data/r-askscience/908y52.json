            "comment": "Its not actually circulation of BLOOD (if it was, those limbs or body parts would die off) \n, its nerves being compressed and cut off . When ever you sit in a position or are in a position for a while that can COMPRESS nerves, they will stop transmitting. The nerve cells themselves will TRY to transmit at first, but when they don't receive feedback, they stop. This is the \"numbness\" or \"this body part fell asleep\" that we all experience. When the compression ends, the nerves can sense this and all at once begin a chain of \"testing\" aka sending out signals to all cells affected down the line, to make sure they are still there. Its like the electrical grid firing back up. It feels painful because our nerves use pain a response. The sensory organs in our brain after about 30 seconds to 120 seconds will shut this test firing pattern off and resume normal operations. But that time in between is pretty painful. It feels like Pins and needles because each sensation is a nerve \" thread ending \" being tested.

(To get really in the weeds, compression the nerve largely means compression of the tiny vessels that feed the nerves, and the fact that the nerves lose some of their own circulation as well as the actual compression of the nerve cells is what is happening to cause the numbness. If larger vessels are also compressed, sure that can be a huge big deal, but that is a separate emergent scenario that you have unfortunately faced yourself)",

Learned a lot along the way. Damaged (but not dead) nerves are still transmitting some info to the muscles, which is very good news, dead nerves are very bad. Damaged nerves will send the painful burning stinging pain signal, healthy nerves that get squished too long (from sitting or cuddling with bae) will also. \n\nThe muscle response you\u2019re having is from them misfiring due to improper nerve signals or from compensation from your injury. There\u2019s not much you can do yourself to relieve them but being able to tell it\u2019s happening ahead of time is beneficial. Heat, ice, muscle rub, muscle relaxers, cannabis, cbd are all good options to calm the muscles before it gets too out of hand. \n\nYour nerves are sending confusing information to your muscles, the surrounding muscles are trying to help out but they also getting confused.

            "comment": "Hey! This was actually one of the first /askscience questions I answered. Copy of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/30d61w/when_a_part_of_your_body_falls_asleep_can_it/cprhn58/?st=jjt35mqo&amp;sh=a680b675) below.\n*****\nThe tingly feeling is usually related more to nerve impingement/entrapment. It's actually pretty hard to completely cut off blood flow to your limbs by compressing/ligating vulnerable vessels. Using the arm as an example, here is the [blood supply](http://imgur.com/CMtLdm4), and the [nerve supply](http://imgur.com/CgykZRR) to the upper limb. (Source: Netter's *Atlas of Human Anatomy*). In the first image, note all the vessels that branch off of the subclavian, sections labelled 1 &amp; 2. The vessels that wrap around the back of the scapula (shoulder blade) and connect with the others around the glenohumeral joint (where the ball of the humerus meets the socket of the shoulder blade) provides *collateral circulation* even if the subclavian/brachial artery is pinched shut in the axilla (armpit), the most vulnerable point.\n\nNow look at the nerves. With the exception of the musculocutaneous nerve, all the nerves that innervate the upper limb pass through the 'pit' of the axilla that is vulnerable to compression (The MC nerve is also vulnerable, just less so).\n\nThe same applies to compression at other vulnerable points, there's almost always better collateral blood supply than there is innervation, since taking out nerve supply upstream cuts off the downstream more effectively than with blood flow.\n\n****\n\nI was a a second (or 1st?) year med student at the time so I'll expand a little - I focused on macro scale blood flow in that answer &amp; waved the rest away as \"nerve compression\", but what actually happens with nerve compression? It's likely related to ischemia/impaired flow, but at the *microvascular* level supplying the nerve. The nerves have tiny blood vessels (vasa ~~vasorum~~ *nervorum*) that supply them, and compressing the nerve will compress these and can compromise the blood supply to the nerve.\n\n[This abstract](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/10679707/) has a decent overview, relevant part quoted below:\n\n&gt;while the membrane depolarization produced by ischemia affects both transient and persistent Na(+) channels. Postischemic and posttetanic paresthesias occur when hyperpolarization by the Na(+)/K(+) pump is transiently prevented by raised extracellular K(+). The electrochemical gradient for K(+) is reversed, and inward K(+) currents trigger regenerative depolarization. These mechanisms of paresthesia generation can account for paresthesias in normal subjects and may be relevant in some peripheral nerve disorders.\n\nThe gist of which is that 1) cuteneous &amp; superficial sensory nerves are more likely to have \"false\" firing (see section above where I quoted) not related to actual stimuli; 2) ischemia (lack of blood flow) causes tissue pH to lower, this is balanced by exchange of Hydrogen ions outside cells for potassium ions inside such that Potassium in the fluid is higher. Then when this hits a tipping point, potassium flows back into the cells - including the nerve. This triggers depolarization (aka firing) of the nerve.\n\nTyping this out between patients, please let me know if you have any questions or want more explanation of something! Hope this answered your question.\n\nEdit: vasa nervorum, not vasa vasorum",

The nerve that supplies your genitalia is known as the pudendal nerve, and it can become compressed, though I couldn\u2019t say for sure if that\u2019s what you\u2019re dealing with. If it gets worse (rare), you can look up \u2018pudendal nerve entrapment\u2019 or \u2018pudendal neuralgia\u2019 (more likely).\n\nBut really the only reason I\u2019m answering this is to say that the name for the nerve is derived from the Latin \u2018pudendum,\u2019 meaning \u2018parts to be ashamed of.\u2019 Shaaaaaaaame!

            "comment": "As people have already correctly mentioned, the pins and needle feeling is due to external pressure on a nerve.  I wanted to expand on it a little bit.  There are a couple of reasons why the pressure affects the nerves.  The most common reason for it is that the compression on the nerve temporarily cuts off the blood supply to that part of the nerve.  This results in a reversible injury to the nerve.  The numbness as well as the pins and needle sensation is called a paresthesia and the nerve injury is called a neurapraxia. \n\nNow for the reason why you feel pins and needles.  What it actually is is your body's perception of pain from the nerve.  Nerves themselves are actually composed of a group of axons and a bunch of supporting cells.  An axon is an offshoot of the nerve cell (the neuron) and this axon is what brings the signal from one neuron to another.  These axons all send different signals.  There are certain axons that come from neurons that control movement.  There are other axons that come from neurons that control normal sensation and other axons that conduct the signal for pain.  When injured, these axons all recover at different rates.  The rate of recovery is dependent on a number of factors including the number of supporting cells and the axon's size.  It just so turns out that the axons that recover from the compression the fastest are the pain fibers and this is why you get the sensation of pins and needles first before you get any other sensation back.\n\nMost of the time, the limb that fell asleep is temporary and harmless but if the pressure is on for an extended period of time, it can cause a long lasting or even permanent injury.  This is why, when a person undergoes surgery, the people working in the operating room take a lot of care in ensuring that no part of the body is being compressed too much.",

            "comment": "Fine. Low quality answers... Ha!  \n\nThe medical term for pins and needles is \"paresthesias\". They usually occur when there is pressure on a nerve. Pressure on a nerve blocks conduction of neural activity in large diameter axons (nerve fibers) selectively, which leaves only conduction in small diameter fibers.  \n\nThe large diameter fibers in a sensory nerve are responsible for light touch and perceptions of length and force in muscles (proprioception). The small diameter fibers are responsible for crude touch, thermal sensation and nociception (responses to stimuli that cause pain in a conscious person).  \n\nSo, when there is pressure on a nerve, you lose light touch and proprioception, and you retain crude touch, thermal sensation, and pain. This results in the paresthesias feeling people report as numbness and tingling, or pins and needles. It usually means a nerve is partially blocked. \n\nIf a nerve is actually partially blocked, a doctor is instructed to map out the body region containing the paresthesias, and use their anatomical training to assign it to the location of the pressure block. Nerve root blocks in the back are common paresthesias (like sciaticia), but so is the paresthesia leading to Tommy John surgery (ulnar at the elbow), and Guion's canal (pinkie numb). \n\nIf you haven't fallen asleep yet in my lecture, the next segment will cover the Gate Control theory of Pain Perception, and how spinal cord stimulators achieve their analgesic effects.

I work in neurophysiology interpreting nervous signals during surgeries that put the nervous system at risk. Mostly, they are spine procedures. Depending upon the position you\u2019ll be laying in for surgery (particularly the prone \u201cSuperman\u201d position) a system of nerves near your armpit is susceptible to discomfort of your arms are positioned awkwardly. In every day situations, if you are laying uncomfortably, you can feel the pins and needle sensation and adjust your position to relieve it. But for surgery, you won\u2019t be able to wake up and adjust yourself. \n\nWhat I do is attach electrodes to different parts of the body and interpret neurophysiological signals from your body that I detect. I can see the effects of mal-position and adjust your position for you so you don\u2019t wake up with a paresthesia (which can last for quite a while). \n\nImagine going in for a back surgery and losing strength and sensation in your arms! That\u2019s just one of the many reasons I might be on your OR team- to reduce the chance of you experiencing this post-op :) \n\nEdit: mobile formatting ",

Nerves can be compressed, sheared, torn, damaged (by high sugar in diabetes or even by your own immune system). In any case, the most common reason to feel pins and needles is from compression. Your nerve can get irritated and send impulses to the brain in this form (ie, feeling like pins and needles, or even burning sensation). Prolonged compression can cause permanent damage. Eventually, the area with pins and needles will feel numb and become weak (depending on the nerve). SO if you sit on the toilet for too long and your legs get numb, no you won't have permanent damage.",

While the origin may differ the reasons this happens is the same; a nerve or group of nerves are unable to properly send signals to the brain. Most commonly it happens when a sensory nerve is compressed from being in an awkward or cramped position such as sitting on a foot fpr too long. The tingling sensation is caused by the nerve trying to resume sensory function by sending pain signals to the brain. More chronic conditions such as pvd or poor circulation can cause this sensation because without adequate blood supply nerve cells can no longer properly send signals to the brain. Hope this answer helps! \n",

            "comment": "Interestingly enough, it\u2019s not a blood vessel that gets blocked or cut off when you get \u201cpins and needles.\u201d It\u2019s a nerve. Nerves generally come in 3 types. Motor, sensory and autonomic (present in internal organs usually). The former two are the most common types and some of our nerves actually are a combination of the those two. The ulnar nerve, for example, innervates the flexor carpi ulnaris (a muscle that helps bend your wrist) and also innervates the area of your hand adjacent to your (and on the) pinky and the pinky-side of your ring finger, front and back. If one is to cut off the supply or block the ulnar nerve, one would feel \u201cpins and needles\u201d or paresthesia on the area aforementioned, and weakness of the innervated muscles. Usually when it\u2019s not a serious injury to the nerve though, only sensation is compromised and it\u2019s more or less temporary. Serious lesions, however, tend to affect the nerves motor innervation causing the muscles it supplies to weaken and waste away (atrophy), and takes more time to recover. Both sensory and motor compromises can be recovered through medical treatment and therapy.",

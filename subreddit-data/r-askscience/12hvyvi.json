At 13:27 Veritasium talks about mutating the ability to mutate more:\n\n&gt; Six of the twelve populations evolved hypermutability -- mutation rates 100x higher than their ancestors. But these populations subsequently acquired additional mutations that brought the mutation rate back down.\n\nEarlier in the video Prof. Lenski mentions that \"evolution in a new environment gets off to a rip-roaring start and then tends to slow down over time.\" So in the first generations, it is advantageous to develop hypermutability to get an edge on the competition, but after the gains from further evolution begin to flatline, it's better to return to a more conservative mutation rate to avoid the proliferation of harmful mutations.",

The human genome is &gt;50% repetitive elements that arose largely from retrotransposon events, causing gene duplications and divergent evolution from there etc. This has been mostly advantageous to us in increasing genetic diversity, however highly mobile transposable elements can be detrimental, and so through evolution the genome has selectively mutated to stop these elements from being mobile. One way this was achieved was through mutation of the poly-A tail of some of these elements, like Alu elements, from an AAAAG repeating sequence to an AAGGG repeating sequence. Great, this inhibits poly-A tailing of the Alu, and stops it retrotransposing to another part of the genome, but having such a G rich repeating region leads to replication slippage and repeat expansion. \n\nThere are a few neurological disorders that have arisen due to this, where large repeat expansions in 3\u2019 regions of Alu elements cause familial myoclonic epilepsies, and also some ataxias.",

            "comment": "This is a actually an interesting question that leads to a much more complex answer than I can probably answer simply. But I'll try. TL:DR: It depends on the environment and what the stressor is. \n\nEssentially, evolution processes are mostly conservative and lazy. If it's not really that big of a deal to the organism, then who cares if the traits drift from one trait to another. It's all pretty much the same so 'who cares mannnn.' As well, large changes to protein sequences are selected against because, usually, these result in a loss of function and are overly deleterious to the organism. Mutations can come in a few varieties: bad, neutral, and beneficial. This depends completely on what the gene is and what the mutation is. Mutations in important regulatory elements are usually selected against - that is, protein changing nucleotide substitutions lead to alteration of the gene's function, misregulation, and ultimately a reduction in fitness of the organism. Mutations that have no real effect on the function of the gene or occur in a gene/region that doesn't really matter that much won't affect the fitness of the organism, so they're retained. And sometimes you get beneficial mutations that leads to gain of a new function or loss of a deleterious function, leading to increased fitness of the organism. \n\nLet's say your example is true and there is some rapid selective sweep of a given allele leading to fixation across the population and this mutation also leads to an increased chance of future mutations. If this is a general feature - that is, a change in polymerase proofreading capabilities that leads to increased mutations, then this would overall be negative for the organism. In a stressful environment necessitating increased mutations for adaptation, then this trait would be beneficial. However, when the organism has adapted and is in a stable environment, many mutations would detrimental. Many mutations would occur in regulatory genes and lead to decreased fitness of the organism. Instead, conditional alteration of mutational rate would be much more beneficial. And, funny enough, this is what is seen. \n\nGenetic duplication is actually another important method for acclimation to stressful environments. It's also one of the ways in which mutational rates can increase. When an important gene with an important function now has a backup copy, one or both copies are now able to mutate without consequence. One copy can complement the lost function from its paralog if they lose a function. This is also how we can get new genes with new functions. If a paralog has reduced selective constraints, its free to accumulate mutations that can lead to a new function. For example, plants exposed to a herbicide. One way they can overcome this stress is by increasing the number of copies present of metabolic efflux pumps. In some cases, the copy number can range between 3 to 9 copies of the gene! \n\nSo I guess to answer your question...this mutation could happen in the short term for some environmental stressors, but that feature itself would be negatively selected against in a stable environment. In fact, high mutational rate may not even be the driver behind adaptation. Genetic duplication may - and usually is - a very important feature in rapid adaptation to environmental stressors.",

This is generally restricted to somatic cell lines (i.e. your body, not your reproductive organs or offspring), and restricted to genes that are involved in detecting and fighting pathogens, like the genes that produce antibodies in your B cell lines. These rapidly mutated proto-B cell lines are then tested in the thymus for their ability to (a) detect and bind to foreign/pathogenic proteins and molecules, and (b) ignore and not attack your body's own cells.",

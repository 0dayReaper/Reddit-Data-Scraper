Some people shorten Saigon to Sigon (\"see-gon\", the g sound from great) because the \"ai\" sound is too long.\n\nThen, splice that together with the word for city, thanh pho, you get Sipho. Of course there are accents on all these words but I thought that was interesting.",

                    "comment": "After experiencing so many viral outbreaks the CDC and local health organizations have gotten much better at responding to these situations. We simply have better protocols in place and better precautions to help contain the disease as much as possible. The hyper-vigilance is more preventative than anything. Also I suspect it\u2019s being more sensationalized than is necessary by the media as that also tends to happen.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to downplay the severity of this outbreak at all, especially for those in the endemic regions. I just want to put this article here as it\u2019s a good reminder of perspective - the world and media loves the spectacle and alarmism of a new outbreak. It\u2019s exciting, and our culture is addicted to entertainment of all kinds. A lot of people have asked about getting the Flu shot. While the flu shot covers *Influenza* virus, which is very different from this 2019-nCoV, a *Coronavirus* - you should know that influenza has killed several thousand people this season in the US alone already. If this outbreak is alarming to you, it should be a good reminder to get your flu shot if you haven\u2019t yet!\n\nhttps://www.providencejournal.com/zz/news/20200124/coronavirus-terrifies-us-but-another-virus-has-already-killed-6000-in-us\n\nEDIT: I of course can not speak on behalf of the Chinese government or Chinese medical officials. There is a metric ton of speculation being thrown around as fact at this point, and it\u2019s too early still to have solid numbers for any meaningful statistical analysis. I would urge you all to be very careful where you get your information from. If it\u2019s not from a website that ends in *.gov* or from the WHO or CDC directly - I would be wary. In the coming weeks try not to focus so much on the panic inducing click bait articles, and wait to hear from reputable organizations on official data. \n\nNote: The mortality rate can only be calculated based on those who are *confirmed* serological cases - there are undoubtedly many more cases who are not officially documented; who either don\u2019t seek medical treatment or do but are not tested for 2019-nCoV and sent home. This is why the official reported mortality rate for these things is hard to assess, but logically is a gross overestimate of reality. Especially being so early in the course of this outbreak we don\u2019t have any remotely reliable numbers. \n\nIn the meantime - if you are in a region of exposure risk you can best protect yourself by avoiding crowded public spaces as much as possible. If traveling a simple surgical mask should suffice as these Coronaviruses are known to spread mainly via respiratory droplets in the air (cough, sneeze, normal breathing). Getting your hands on an N95 or better would offer more protection, but probably isn\u2019t necessary outside of a medical facility. Also wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, avoid touching your face with your hands. This doesn\u2019t guarantee anything but can help prevent many infections. I cannot give out medical advice on here - if you or someone has any concerns for your health it is important that you see a health care professional in your area to be evaluated. \n\nThank you and stay healthy out there!\n\nBonus: how the 2019-nCoV compares with other pathogens, interactive graphical format:\n\nhttps://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/the-microbescope-infectious-diseases-in-context/",

Media is blowing it up because China and other governments are likely not reporting/over run with new cases every minute. The main thing that needs to happen is education about what the virus does and when to get help. Media typically reports the information that gets views rather than saves lives or prevents spread. It\u2019s pretty sad that when I google Coronavirus, it brings up an article with the title like \u201cPatient dead by new coronavirus\u201d when it was an 80 year old male with emphysema and other complications and they proceed to quote young patients who were told to go home and take some medication to prevent spread and get over the illness. They \u201cbelieve the hospital is not handling this well.\u201d Well maybe try to look up some info about the virus and try to minimize spread by staying home unless you need medical attention. I hope the WHO or CDC can send some actual recommendations to the population about what they can reasonably do to prevent spread and treat at home.\n\nEDIT: found a decent graphic on signs and symptoms until a certain organization can make an actual recommendation.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/coolguides/comments/etlo9i/coronavirus_signs_and_symptoms/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_term=link\n\nEDIT 2: to be clear I don\u2019t want to demean the severity or implications of this outbreak. We simply don\u2019t have enough info so far. I\u2019m really hoping someone can publish some real guidance soon. Yes the graphic isn\u2019t for this outbreak but it is for people who don\u2019t even know what Coronavirus is \ud83d\udc51 to understand what we may be dealing with until there is more formation\n\nEDIT 3: since people did not like the graphic, here is at least a bit of info directly from the WHO. Hopefully more to follow. \nhttps://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus",

It\u2019s difficult cuz most people get their news from Facebook or google searches which *surprise* - is not backed by the CDC or any reputable entity.\n\nEDIT: yes I\u2019m aware of the risk of birth defects Zika carries, particularly microcephaly. Numerous studies have shown this and the viral RNA has been shown to persist in male semen. \n\nFrom the CDC: Men who have traveled to areas with risk of Zika should wait at least 3 months after travel (or 3 months after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to conceive with their partner. Women should wait at least 2 months after travel (or 2 months after symptoms started if they get sick) before trying to get pregnant. The waiting period is longer for men because Zika stays in semen longer than in other body fluids.\n\nI was referring to people not pregnant nor looking to become pregnant within the conceivable future. In these people there is little to no risk of a Zika infection. But still many people were scared to travel anywhere south or tropical because of how the media blew it up at the time. That was my only point, not to delve into details of the Zika virus.",

If that fails, then we are looking at hundred or millions of cases and corresponding deaths.\n\nMuch much more importantly is the risk of further mutations. Those risks dramatically increase as the number of infected increase.",

Its like the ultimate \"survivorship bias\" in practice.\n\nA subtle example would be sickle cell anemia, having both disease alleles generally isnt great, but you see the disease allele actually get selected for in malaria prone areas. You cant really say having the disease gene is \"more evolved\" or not having the disease gene is \"more evolved\". It gets more complicated when you might have a *heterozygote advantage*, where you have both a non disease allele and a disease allele which confers the highest increase in fitness while both homozygous states dont have as much selective pressure driving it, its just the evolutionary trade off. It just is what it is. Whatever is most functional for the environment. Ditto with cystic fibrosis.",

But if I\u2019m understanding you correctly the virus mutation is basically dumb luck and that makes it resistant.\n\nViruses mutate because they mutate.  There is no way to add \"to become\" into that sentence.\n\nYour second alternative in the second sentence is also not quite correct.  It's not dumb luck making it resistant. \n\nWhat happens is that a virus mutates.  When it does so, one of three things can happen: either it is more likely to survive and multiply with the mutation, less likely, or no effect.  If, for whatever reason, a mutation causes a virus to be more effective at surviving and multiplying, then that particular virus will be more likely to pass on its genes.  That makes the entire more population more fit.\n\nA couple things to note:\n\n* You could actually take out \"survive\" from that sentence above.  If a gene actually made the virus less likely to survive but \\*more\\* likely to pass on its genes, then this will actually cause the descendant of that virus to end up dominating the population.  \n* In some cases, it may actually help the virus to become \\*less\\* resistant in order to survive.  A virus that gets too successful might actually end up killing off its hosts too fast.  Also, if the virus becomes too dominant in determining the fitness of another species, then suddenly an arms race begins where the host concentrates on fighting just that virus.  There are more possibilities as well, any of which would actually reduce the overall effectiveness of the virus to propagate. \n* Mutations can eventually lead to other changes in the virus that have nothing to do with resistance.  Anything that makes the virus more fit is going to be selected going forward, although there is a complicated interplay between fitness in the short, medium, and long term.",

Once exposed to it the immune system does not recognize it so it takes longer to fight off and can potentially do more harm and be transmitted broadly. These types of outbreaks also tend to occur in more impoverished regions with dense populations as well as overall poor sanitation, and poor access to quality medical care. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to compare which ones are \u201cbetter or worse\u201d aside from looking at the mortality rate or death toll and other complications after the fact. Although comparing this to Ebola I\u2019d say it\u2019s definitely not nearly as extreme or dangerous *if you were to be infected.* \n\nEdit: From a global standpoint it is too early to tell the impact of mortality compared to past epidemics. I am not familiar with details on the new Wuhan Coronavirus transmissibility but I have seen others post early estimations about it. The outcome of total deaths will depend on how well it\u2019s contained. For example influenza is more easily spread and ubiquitous worldwide (compared to Ebola) and kills many more each year than Ebola ever did. \n\nWe can speculate to no end on the possible number affected but this thread is not meant for speculation. We are still in the very beginning of this emerging outbreak, so all we can do is wait for hard data to be released. Also note that the official count of people infected is a gross underestimate in these situations. The vast majority will experience mild cold symptoms of fever, chills, muscle/body aches, headache, fatigue - and not seek medical attention. And if they do, most will likely not be tested for serological confirmation of 2019-nCoV infection. Therefore whatever the officially released mortality rate ends up being is on the very high end of estimation and in reality is probably significantly lower.",

I\u2019d been into the containment lab, developed a fever within the 10 day window and it wasn\u2019t strep throat (simple easy thing that could rule out worse issues). So I had to quarantine myself in my apartment for 3 days. Rule is, 3 day at home unless respiratory symptoms develop, then it would be off to hospital quarantine for more stringent measures. Thankfully, no respiratory issues, and fever broke after 2 days. The reason I go into the details here is to try and make it clear what level of precautions we take when working with these viruses, to protect ourselves and everyone else",

The problem with these markets, is that there is a lot of mixing of animal blood and germs and stuff. When that mixes, that means that the bacteria and viruses also mix, and can evolve from the mixing (more or less). So when they eat the animals, or sometimes even just come in contact with the animals, then boom they can get a new virus or bacteria that has never been seen before. Since it was just created by the mixing of animal matter, that also means that we have no current vaccine for it either.",

This is why it is slightly \"easier\" for disease to jump from birds or pigs to humans but generally not other animals.\n\nI don't think there has been any discussion of concern so far for birds spreading it via migration.",

It was approved for use on the US in 2019, but was deployed in the Congo in 2018. I believe the current formulation was ready around 2015 at a point ready for human trials.  So, that was 12-15 years depending on how you look at it.  They are still working on SARS vaccine.  This virus is similar, so there's a chance that research could \"speed\" things along a little.",

Speaking for myself who is currently in midwestern United States the flu season usually runs through May at the very latest. It usually peaks around Dec-Jan. Notice how I said it is *getting towards* the end and I didn\u2019t say *it is the end* of flu season, and I started by saying it still won\u2019t hurt to get the flu shot, regardless.",

    "postText": "  \n\nHello,\n\nI came across this article today (it was a busy weekend) and wanted some opinions on some thoughts inspired by it. The article is from Tyson (2023), which details an experiment that showed wood (altered) can be used to conduct electricity (Tran et al., 2023; Tyson, 2023). Tran et al. 2023, imply (to me) that the outcome was essentially a cellulose product that can be impregnated with a polymer to help conduct electricity and likely reduce the flammability. However, if I understand (Salmeia et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019) correctly; given the assumption that if heat can be used to create energy (Chu,2018), the opposite is true; and if that is the case heat is likely to be a byproduct from electricity (assumption based on energy loss/entropy). \n\nSo, my initial question is: \n\nIf Tyson (2023) and Tran et al. (2023) allow for a cellulose material  (impregnated in a polymer) that improves conductivity (and likely reduces flammability), and some concerns are conductivity of cellulose and the flammability (Salmeia et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2019). An additional factor is an ability to create flame-retardant cellulose fibers better (Claire, 2023; Salmeia et al., 2016) and potentially combine them with the properties allocated (in this posting) to Tran et al., 2023. Primarily the impregnation and coating of the material with a polymer to increase conductivity and assumedly to reduce flammability (Chu, 2018; Salmeia et al., 2016; Tran et al., 2023; Tyson, 2023; Zhang et al., 2019). Could a layer of conductive metals, silver (Tran et al., 2023) or a silver and superalloy mixture (Sands, 2022; T. Smith, 2022; T. M. Smith et al., 2023); with an outer coating of the polymer that also incorporates a matrix structure (within the polymer) to facilitate conductivity better (Pan et al., 2022) comprised of the metals used, increase conductivity, and additively decrease flammability?\n\nAdditional Questions: Could the cellulose fibers (flame retardant) be created to include a matrix of metal fibers (second option) within its structure and be subsequently impregnated and further coated, as inquired about above?\n\n   Thanks for any help or responses; I was trying to de-stress and grow (or correct my knowledge base). Have a Good Day!!\n\n**References**\n\nChu, J. (2018, January 17). *Turning heat into electricity*. MIT News | Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

    "postText": "I have type 1 diabetes and manage my blood glucose with a CGM, pump, and insulin (Novorapid which is supposedly identical to human insulin).\n\nRecently I have been using an APS (artificial pancreas system) which links my CGM and pump together to effectively emulate a healthy human pancreas. This APS system doesn't work perfectly and I often have high glucose after meals and occasionally low glucose (usually due to the absorption speed of meals or exercise).\n\nI don't know any of the technical parts of how the pancreas does its job in managing glucose levels, but I have a good understanding of how to manage my own diabetes regardless. \n\nMy main two questions would be:\n1. How does the pancreas prevent (or at least reduce) sudden spikes in glucose after a meal?\n2. How does insulin on board not affect healthy people (non diabetics) as much during exercise?\n\nTo add to the first question, as a T1 diabetic I need to inject (using a pump) a predetermined amount of insulin based on the total carbohydrates in a meal and this is a very rough estimate because absorption speeds can vary greatly. In a closed loop APS, the only way I've seen people prevent spikes (without knowing the carbs) is having insulin already on board but I don't understand how this would be possible in a healthy human body which isn't warned in advance about food.\n\nTo add to the second question, it is often too risky for me to exercise just after a meal because of all the insulin on board. The only method I can think of to reduce the risk of a hypo during exercise is to inject less insulin for the meal, but from the first question I either need to know this in advance or I need to be injecting small increments whenever I see a rise in glucose which would also result in hyperglycaemia.\n\nI suppose I should also mention that CGMs measure glucose from the interstitial fluid, so trends are usually delayed by 10-15 minutes (although I'd assume the current glucose level can be extrapolated).\nAlso there are faster types of insulin available, such as Fiasp and Lyumjev, but I'd like to focus on why human insulin is still effective without needing these properties.\n\nThanks for reading!",

            "comment": "&gt;2 How does insulin on board not affect healthy people (non diabetics) as much during exercise?\n\nThe insulin-glucagon hormone system is not the only system that can affect glucose metabolism. Adrenaline and noradrenaline have somewhat similar metabolic effects to glucagon (opposing insulin), promoting release of glucose to the blood to prepare for fight or flight. Exercise releases adrenaline and noradrenaline, helping to provide glucose to fuel the effort.\n\nI'm actually not sure exactly how that situation would differ in diabetics. But a disruption in one of the hormone systems involved, combined with non-physiological insulin release, probably leads to less fine-tuned control of blood glucose levels.",

I don't know anything about how they work, but I'd assume insulin production would also be linked to the rest of the endocrine system and being able to measure hormone concentrations in the body could help us refine the current closed loop algorithms. That's all assuming the location of insulin delivery doesn't make much of a difference.",

            "comment": "An increase in blood sugar causes a series of hormonal releases (probably starting in the hypothalamus) that ultimately tells the pancreas to release insulin, which makes the cells of the body permeable to glucose and also makes the liver start converting glucose to glycogen. So between them they quickly reduce your blood sugar again. There will be a short spike but the body's desire for homeostasis means it returns to a normal level pretty quickly.\n\nIf blood glucose gets too low then the pancreas secretes glucagon which tells the liver to turn glycogen back into glucose to increase the level again. If there's no more glycogen then the body starts releasing fat from adipose tissue or breaking down protein (or even nucleotides) as an emergency fuel source. This last one is the worst option as a byproduct is ammonia which is toxic and can interfere with Kreb's Cycle.",

Glucagon stimulates the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose\u2026the more glucagon, the faster blood sugar will respond.\n\nBy releasing insulin in response to high sugar, and glucagon in response to low sugar, the (healthy) pancreas keeps blood sugar in balance.\n\nMany type-1 diabetics carry an emergency dose of glucagon, and [some research has been done into closed-loop systems for diabetics that could release glucagon and insulin both](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/43/11/2721/35834/Dual-Hormone-Closed-Loop-System-Using-a-Liquid) just like a healthy pancreas.",

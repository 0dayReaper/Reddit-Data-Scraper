    "postText": "Hello, I am a researcher in a research lab on a college campus and I am getting started with electron microscopy and I am having issues with sample preparation. All of my magnetic nanoparticles keep clumping together and that is not what we are wanting to view, we want to see individual nanoparticles. Our solution is in a liquid, and we have tried diluting the solution more and more and yet, the particles still agglomerate and give images that we are not looking for. Thanks for any help y'all can give.",

            "comment": "I did some work with gold and silver colloids comprised of nano particles, and we stabilized the colloid with a citrate, which forms a double layer of charge, providing electrostatic repulsion(via zeta potential) and stabilizing against agglomeration. In general this is called colloid stabilization. Perhaps there is an analogous stabilizing agent you can use for preventing agglomeration of your particles.",

            "comment": "Is it possible that your nanoparticles are magnetised, and that is adding to the clumping problem? Might it help to \"demagnetise\" the solution (with a decreasing-amplitude AC magnetic field) before attempting sample-prep?  \n\n\nA couple of decades ago I was preparing magnetic nanoparticles... my biggest issues were that they were pyrophoric so had to be handled in a glove box, and then when bone dry, they'd fly away everywhere with static electricity!",

            "comment": "First do your best to prevent NP agglomeration in solution. This is handled by dilution and as someone else mentioned, potentially with additives. Naturally, use the solvent most suited to dispersing your particles. Vortex or ultrasonicate the solution immediately before preparing your sample.\n\nYou also need to prevent NP aggregation as your liquid dries. Spin coat if you can. Use TEM preparation tricks if you can. Maybe you can even use a TEM grid instead of a Si wafer (just view the TEM grid under SEM). Place the TEM grid over a highly wicking material like a cleanroom wipe and dropcast your solution. Use a low surface tension and fast evaporating solvent like IPA or even hexanes if possible. The wicking of the solution away from the grid combined with fast evaporation will allow the nanoparticles to settle on the substrate faster than they can find each other. Contrast, e.g., just letting an aqueous solution dry slowly on the center of a Si wafer.",

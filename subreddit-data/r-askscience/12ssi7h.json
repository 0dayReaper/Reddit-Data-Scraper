            "comment": "One factor is that many plants have more than just pairs of chromosomes - they may have 4+ copies of the same chromosome.  This provides protection against inbreeding by increasing the reserve of diversity within any population / region.  So assuming there's some normal cross-plant pollination going on, a few generations of inbreeding isn't a big deal.\n\nAlso, inbreeding just isn't that big a deal anyhow, at least not for populations of plants.   The consequences can be harsh for individuals, which bothers us when it happens to fellow humans or pets, but as regards a species, it is a useful tool driving evolution or even domestic breeding.  The fact that some seeds may not flourish is not really a big problem for a plant population, especially if it means some few individuals do abnormally well.\nMany domestic animals a highly inbred.  When I worked with lab mice, they were intentionally inbred for 20+ generations to ensure genetic consistency.  The inbreeding helped insure an ABSENCE of (unwanted) defects.",

Many plant species have a LOT of genetic diversity so can tolerate inbreeding more so than others. The sheer amount and diverse genetics of most plants help hide or mitigate defects. \n\nYou sound more knowledgeable though. My bio degree is disintegrating because it's so old, haha!",

One person had a bag of red ones, one had a bag of yellow, etc. The person with the blue bag had the very first blue eye mutation. When blue and yellow had kids, the kids had a mix of blue/yellow M&amp;Ms, and some of them had blue eyes. \n\nTens of thousands of years later, everyone has a bag full of randomly mixed colors. Everyone with blue eyes has at least a couple blue M&amp;Ms in there because they're a distant descendent of that one guy, but most of their bag is probably not blue. If you have blue eyes and you have kids with someone else that has blue eyes, technically you're very distantly related. But you probably only have a few M&amp;Ms in common, specifically the eye color ones, most of your M&amp;Ms are different - nothing to worry about.\n\nThe thing with cheetahs is: they have no more blue M&amp;Ms, no more green ones, no more yellow ones, and so on. Every cheetah today has a mix of red and brown M&amp;Ms only, because at some point in the past every other color got wiped out. When a cheetah with 60% red M&amp;Ms mates with one that has 45% red, there's a *lot* of shared genes, and that's when you have problems.\n\nA little inbreeding isn't ideal, but it's not a disaster. It quickly gets worse when you repeatedly inbreed for multiple generations.

All individuals, by necessity, share a limited number of potential ancestors.\n\nThe other is the mutations you've mentioned. These mutations likely occur in the context of a larger population where the mutated individual still has a large amount of potential partners, and while all descendants might share that ancestor, they don't share all/a limited amount of ancestors. \n\nTo use the example of 4 cheetahs, every individual cheetah would have those 4 as *multiple* ancestors in their family tree, a bit like [Cleopatra VII ](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qeqNOjC7wd0/TjTfjAdtlRI/AAAAAAAAK6c/Qr75rPB3Q-w/s1600/ptolemaic_tree.jpg).",

While there was a great reduction in diversity near then, it may have occurred earlier.

Mostly because it would require humans *everywhere* to all evolve simultaneously as humans had already expanded out into Asia and had made it as far as Australia.  We have no evidence that those humans are significantly different genetically based on bones found.\n\nWhat's more likely is that the milder climates of Asia allowed larger tribes, easier lives for their members, and provided new stimulus for more complex tools.  Those tools then proliferated quickly, in archaeological terms, across humanity.  Just as population growth drove innovation and specialization in the modern world, so it did after humanity began to expand around the world 65,000 years ago.",

A family contains many genuses.  Literally no species is genetically similar enough to any species in other genuses in their family to interbreed. If they could, then they wouldn't be classified as separate genuses in the first place. Species and genuses are not inmate facts of reality; they're just ways in which we write things down to help us understand how things are related to each other.\n\nHumans HAVE interbred with many other species of apes within their same genus over time, though. None of them are alive today because we incorporated them into us and the remaining ones that didn't come to live and mate with us died out because we were too badass for them to compete with.\n\nThe evolutionary picture is still very incomplete and there were a TON of interbreeding events before we were technically *Homo sapiens* yet but at the very least we have direct evidence that *Homo sapiens* in Europe interbred with *Homo neanderthensalis* extensively and with *Homo denisova* in Asia. There is also evidence of the Denisovans and Neanderthals interbreeding independently of Humans.",

            "comment": "Inbreeding involves repeatedly mating individuals with similar alleles. Because they are genetically similar, this means that it's far more likely for offspring to be homozygous for genes \u2014 that is, they will have the same alleles for one gene instead of different ones. This is in contrast with outbreeding (breeding with distantly related individuals), which is more likely to yield heterozygous individuals \u2014 individuals with non-identical alleles for genes.\n\n\nAs mentioned by other comments \u2014 this isn't inherently dangerous or damaging. Consider the following: there is a gene in dogs with two alleles. One of the alleles does something bad (e.g. makes dogs very likely to get cancer when they're an adult), while the other doesn't harm them at all. If inbreeding was selectively performed (i.e. only breeding together individuals with the harmless allele), you could very easily stamp out that bad allele and make it so all dogs have that good gene.\n\n\nThe above described scenario is incredibly common, as well as inbreeding for specific traits. In fact, practically all of the things you eat which come from plants are the result of inbreeding. Just look at prehistoric corn compared to modern day corn \u2014 you can't even tell they're the same plant because of how insanely different they look. \n\n\nHowever, note the very, very, **very** key word here: **selective.** Inbreeding becomes harmful when individuals with harmful alleles are continuously allowed to breed with their relatives, increasing the amount of harmful alleles in offspring as generations go on. For inbreeding to be consistently positive, breeders must be be ruthlessly selective: \n\n\n1. Individuals without the right traits are not bred and may be sterilized.\n\n\n2. Individuals with the right traits who sire sickly offspring may be removed from the breeding pool and sterilized. \n\n\n3. Oftentimes, only the best of the best is bred. Want to breed giant strawberries? Every generation, only the couple of plants that make the biggest strawberries get bred.",

At the same time, the number of crossovers is usually kept at a very low level. As a consequence, many organisms need to make the best possible use from the one or two crossovers that occur per chromosome in meiosis. From this perspective, the decision of where to allocate rare crossover events becomes an important issue, especially in self-pollinating plant species, which experience limited variation due to inbreeding. \n\nhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2018.00609/full\n\nThe math:\n\nhttps://www.cs.cmu.edu/~genetics/units/instructions/instructions-3FC.pdf",

The idea goes that cloning/selfing offers many significant short-term advantages (more consistent phenotypes, no need to find a mate) at the cost of long-term survival. Eventually, environmental changes will outpace a clonal/selfing lineage's ability to generate adaptive genetic variation and the lineage fail to adapt/go extinct.\n\nIn any case, this hypothesis leads to a testable prediction: clonality/selfing repeatedly evolves over and over again, but these lineages tend to go extinct at higher rates long-term. Consistent with this, we do generally observe a \"patchy\" distribution of purely clonal/selfing plants across the tree of life, and these lineages are often inferred to have originated relatively recently. [Here's](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/68/3/505/5200730) the most recent paper I know of that tested (and found support!) for this pattern using state-of-the-art statistical models.

Yes there may be more obvious differences between isolated populations over time due to different selection pressures affecting different groups, but this really just leads to more speciation and less randomness because of less intermixing leading to lower overall randomness.\n\nThats why animals that are less likely to be geographically isolated seem to have more diversity than those bound to certain environments as survival strategies.  Migrating insects and birds are much more biodiverse than species isolated to a specific habitat or those living in a specific niche for a single ecosystem.   Reef fish and deep ocean fish are much more biodiverse than freshwater fish adapted to fill niches in rivers and lakes.",

The difference between cross-pollinators and selfpollinators is that cross-pollinators can have homozygous alleles like AA or heterozygous alleles like Bb. In the case of cross pollinated crops you are right. The offspring could recieve two recessive alleles from the same parent. For example AaBbCc x AaBbCc could become aabbcc and therefore suffer from inbreeding depression after multiple generations but it depends also on sensitivity of the crop itself.  \n\nBut self-pollinated crops only consist of homozygous alleles. For example AAbbCCdd. So if you would self this plant it would be AAbbCCdd x AAbbCCdd and the offspring still has the same alleles AAbbCCdd as the parent.\n\nSo this was just an example I know a plant has way more alleles but if its a self-pollinator all the alleles are homozygous. \n\nUnless (induced) mutations happen of course.",

They breed out most harmful recessive traits pretty quickly. Offspring is genetically often very similar to the parents but not on the level of clones.\n\nThis is because if a organism would have Aa as a trait. Where a is a recessive gene that would either stop or significantly reduce the chance of the offspring from reproducing it has a large selective pressure from being removed from the gene pool in a self fertilizing organism. Let's say aa is competently infertile from 1000 offspring 750 would be able to reproduce again and 250 of those would be AA and 500 Aa. Every generation 1/3th of the offspring of Aa would stop carrying the recessive gene while AA would very quickly make up most of genetics of the population.\n\nThis happens to all recessive traits in self fertilizing or pollinating organism. Negative recessive traits that allow some individuals to produce offspring get also affect by this but slower but then it's hundreds of generations instead of 10's of generations before a bad gene is removed from the gene pool.\n\nIf you had a organism that often breeds with a genetically different member of the species the a trait is rarely going to express itself. So those species don't really weed out recessive traits as fast. Humans are part of that category and we have a bunch of pretty bad recessive traits that don't often get expressed if we don't breed with family members.",

It refers to the deleterious genes present in an individual that can reduce an individual\u2019s survival or reproduction.  If self fertilization occurs, genetic load in a population can be removed as the individuals who inherit deleterious genes suffer reduced survival or reduced reproduction.  Reduction in survival and reproduction eliminates the presence of deleterious genes in the population.  Generation after generation of self fertilization will eliminate genetic load.  Also, it takes very little out-crossing to maintain genetic diversity in a population.  The value of genetic diversity in the context of genetic load is that the effect of deleterious genes on survival or reproduction can be reduced or masked by the paired presence of functioning forms of the genes.  All of this assumes that the species is diploid and reproduces sexually (by selfing or outcrossing).",

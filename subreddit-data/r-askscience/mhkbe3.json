            "comment": "The short answer is no. The long answer: Our immune systems aren't like muscles that need to be worked out to grow strong. By the time we reach young adulthood, we are (under normal circumstances) exposed to so many microbes, pathogens, spores, allergens, etc that we have very robust immune responses, even to things we haven't been exposed to. This isn't necessarily because we have the antibodies for every disease we've been exposed to being produced and floating around our bodies at all times as \"strength\" would suggest. Rather, our immune system maintains \"the plans\" for those antibodies so if we are re-exposed to a pathogen or encounter one that's similar to one we've had in the past, our bodies can quickly and efficiently drum up the antibodies necessary to kick it to the curb.\n\nComing into contact with a pathogen triggers an immune response whether we've been exposed to it previously or not (hence why novel covid-19, for example, didn't have a 100% mortality rate), but this won't make your immune system stronger because that's not how immune systems work. They don't strengthen, they diversify. As a result, low exposure to pathogens in 2020 due to social isolation doesn't weaken or atrophy immune systems. But we don't need constant exposure to different things for our immune systems to be able to run immune responses.\n\nThat's not to say that social isolation doesn't have an effect. There's research to show that immune responses are diminished in individuals experiencing stress, loneliness, anxiety, and other negative psychological stimuli. An aggregate of 148 different studies found that people who were more socially connected had a 50% lower mortality rate. One experiment even found that people with many social ties are less susceptible to the common cold which is another coronavirus. This is not a direct effect however, it's indirect.\n\nAnd almost all bets are off with influenza. As other commenters have mentioned it's going to be very difficult to create an effective flu vaccine for the upcoming season due to the gap in case data from the prior year. Flu almost always jumps from animal populations to human populations on a regular basis so the virus is \"novel\" very often. Again, we have some ability to mount an immune response to it, but influenza continues to maintain a high mortality rate given how commonplace it is.",

I was going off the logic that I\u2019d heard that young kids whose parents try to keep them away from germs might be actually hurting them by not giving them germ exposure. But it sounds like that might be more of an issue for children, not adults. Does this create risk for children who have had little bacterial exposure the last year? Or is it a short enough period of time not to matter?\n\nRelated link: https://askdoctorg.com/kids-germs-bubble/",

You reach a point where your immune system has a pretty good database to work off of after a few years of encountering infectious or inflammatory stuff. \n\nWhat people don\u2019t consider is that on a daily basis, our bodies are launching an immune response to literally millions of attacks that we don\u2019t even know are going on because not every immune response causes symptoms. (Fun side fact, the symptoms of an illness are not caused by the pathogen, they are the result of your body\u2019s immune response. Fever for example is your body raising its own temperature in an attempt to kill foreign bacteria or viruses). Even with lower socialization in quarantine, our bodies are still inundated with countless immune triggering pathogens, bacteria, spores, allergens, even our own cell mutations. Just because you haven\u2019t gotten a head cold in a year or dodged the flu doesn\u2019t mean your immune system isn\u2019t still being put to the test. The world is a filthy place. \n\nThat being said, unless kids have been in hyperbaric chambers all 2020, they\u2019re probably still being exposed to enough immune triggers to keep developing healthy and normal immune responses.",

Bacteria (and one virus) that produce exotoxins have direct effects which are often severe, causing many types of food poisoning, whooping cough, botulism, gas gangrene, some staph infections, and major rotavirus symptoms. Then plenty of bugs have mechanisms that dampen down immune responses and they cause a lot of tissue damage and susceptib ility to other opportunistic infections while the immune system isn't looking, eg rubella infection of a fetus, gas gangrene (again), measles encephalitis, AIDS-associated fungal infections, various bacteria that cause \"flesh eating\" ulcers and soft tissue damage (mycobacterium ulcerans, group A streptococcus) etc. There are undoubtedly effects on the immune system by all these bugs, but not all symptoms are caused by the immune system.",

The Covid measures have been effective at breaking the transmission within the human population, but once we\u2019re no longer wearing masks and distancing, once it returns to the human population in a crossover event, it will resume its usual transmission cycle.\n\nPerhaps if the idea that people who feel unwell should wear masks and not do silly things like try to work through it in the office become established norms, we might have far less severe flu seasons, but I fear that won\u2019t be the case.\n\nI am given to believe that a lot of the reason we were able to get Covid vaccines so quickly was because of research efforts to develop flu vaccines. The team that developed the AZ vaccine at Oxford, for example, had previously been working (so far unsuccessfully) on a \u201cuniversal\u201d flu vaccine.",

Most human cases of flu are caused by influenza A strains, and influenza A infects so many damn birds that one or two years of fewer humans getting it probably won\u2019t have a big impact on its evolution. \n\nIt\u2019s more possible that Covid mitigation could have impacted the evolution of influenza B (which has animal reservoirs but does primarily infect humans). But it\u2019s also possible that the behavior-driven decrease in cases will obscure which strains we need to be most concerned about when behaviors can shift back and make planning  vaccines more difficult for the next couple seasons.\n\nBasically all the public health people I know who think about this have even less confidence than normal that they know what future flu seasons will look like, and they\u2019re hoping people in more countries are now comfortable enough with masks that in the future they\u2019ll wear them when they feel under the weather, especially during the winter.",

It's not -eradicated-, so it'll pop up again when conditions allow it to spread (both in number of contacts/travel, and in our immune resistance to a particular strain).\n\nIt's sorta the opposite of victory. Our failure to contain Coronavirus means that it's likely to become a disease -like- the flu, where there's enough of it circulating among humans and animal reservoirs at-scale that it becomes seasonal and common, with lots of mutations.\n\nThat's not saying that coronavirus as-is will rage on forever, more that vulnerable populations who are wary of influenza today have two families of virus to worry about, and we all need occasional boosters.\n\nSpanish Flu was likely the first H1N1. H1N1 still exists, it's less deadly now because the people who are most vulnerable to it... are dead. That's not victory, that's defeat. If we'd been able to stop H1N1 from spreading in 1917, there would have been one fewer way to die for the last 100 years.",

It's that humans WERENT a host for mutation. \n\nSince no one knows anything about mutations...Any time an organism reproduces there is a chance for a mutation to occur. It usually does nothing, sometimes it's bad for the organism, sometimes it's good. And since this is occurring at random, the number of chances it gets increases the likelihood for it to occur. With fewer hosts because humans were basically taken out of the pool, it is LESS LIKELY to have happened.\n\nIn addition to this, the mutations were not able to use selection pressure in human hosts to become more virulent. Think of it like this. A virus is in a dog. It mutates. It can now infect human cells twice as well. But there are no human cells. The mutation did not help the virus. And usually mutations come with a cost. So now it can't infect dog cells as well. The virus that would do well in humans now dies. This basic idea is why we aren't susceptible to every virus in existence.",

Once you get out of your environment and get exposed to other people and the diseases *they\u2019re* immune to, there\u2019s a problem.  I could point to things like the 70-80% of native peoples in North America that died to exposure to European diseases when the Scandinavians arrived (leading to later colonists seeing fields of cultivatable plants waiting for them, as if by providence\u2014and of course, the diseases *they* brought wrecked the survivors of the previous centuries\u2019 outbreaks)...but that\u2019s an extreme example.\n\nA better example would be the disease seasons you typically see in colleges at the beginning of the school year, particularly in service academies.  At Texas A&amp;M, we referred to it as \u201cthe Corps Crud,\u201d mostly because\u2014as I\u2019m sure you can imagine\u2014it seemed to affect the Corps of Cadets more than non-regs.  It\u2019s not a seasonal disease in the traditional sense; just a mash of diseases that hits everyone because they\u2019re coming from all over the state (or country, or world).  \n\nThat\u2019s what I imagine the end to social distancing measures being, anyway: a whole country coming down with the Corps Crud.",

Above this, they can spread increasingly quickly and be more destructive with more oxygen.  So forest fires would be worse. A lot worse.  This is the fire window. \n\nAbove 30% or so, earth would have to be much wetter than today, and oxygen levels stop mattering as much as moisture levels, so there is a control there. But any fire starting in dry material at 30% oxygen levels like they were in the past would spread incredibly quickly and capable of immense destruction.",

Probably would burn annually or even more often and would be brushy like chaparral or grassy. Some really wet areas like rain forests and swamps wouldn\u2019t burn.",

When a fire gets big enough, it sucks in all the oxygen it needs anyway, like a thermobaric bomb.",

Think slash and burn agriculture, hunting, land clearing for settlement, resource collection, etc.  The reasons fires in the US in particular seem so bad is because the nations that existed here before burned their land much more frequently than we currently do.  Frequent fires usually mean low intensity fires.",

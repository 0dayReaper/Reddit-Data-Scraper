I don't mean \"why is h2 at the cathode and o2 at the  anode\", I mean, the water molecule is split somewhere, and then the  oxygen and hydrogen just... travel to the place where there be their  charge? Are the water molecules split between the anode and cathode and  just travel up at them? If they travel to the opposite end, why don't we  see bubbles anywhere but the electrodes?",

            "comment": "&gt;I mean, the water molecule is split somewhere\n\nI think you are getting hung up thinking of it as **the** water molecule.  Keep in mind water is a sea of molecules, with a lot of exchanges going on:\n\nH2O \u21cc H^+ + OH^-\n\nOH^- + H2O \u21cc H2O + OH^-\n\nH^+ + H2O \u21cc H3O^+\n\nH3O^+ + H2O \u21cc H2O + H3O^+\n\nSo when the hydrogen in a water molecule near the cathode accepts an electron to start forming H2, the remaining OH^- doesn't *itself* have to migrate to the anode to be oxidized to O2.  It just has to exchange with a neighboring water molecule's hydrogen, so now there is a new OH^- a little closer to the anode.  So you end up with H^(+)'s being transferred along through the aqueous medium, something like a bucket brigade, to keep supplying H^+ to the cathode and OH^- to the anode, but not necessarily the same H or O in each transfer.\n\n*H*3O^+ + H2O + H2O + H2O -&gt;\n\n*H*2O + H3O^+ + H2O + H2O -&gt;\n\n*H*2O + H2O + H3O^+ + H2O -&gt; -&gt; -&gt;\n\n\nH2O + H2O + H2O + *O*H^- -&gt;\n\nH2O + H2O + OH^- + H2*O* -&gt;\n\nH2O + OH^- + H2O + H2*O* -&gt; -&gt; -&gt;\n\nIn effect you have H^(+)'s being passed along in one direction, and OH^(-)'s being passed along in the other direction.\n\n(Edit: italicized the initial H and O)",

And unlike a Newton's Cradle (with simultaneous transfers), this is a much less orderly process.  Sometimes a sandbag gets passed back before going on, or someone has to wait for a sandbag, etc.  This makes it a much slower process than say electrical conductance in a wire.",

[This is what 1 picosecond of movement in a water droplet at 0 C looks like](http://www.chamotlabs.com/Movies/ColdWater.mp4).  They do move around a lot, and a lot of collisions take place in between even  diffusion controlled reactions like H-abstraction (timescale 10^(-9) sec).\n\nBut relative to molecular vibrations, for instance, they are barely moving at all.  Bond stretching vibrations (O-H stretch timescale ~10^(-13) sec), are orders of magnitude faster than collisions.  And electronic transitions are several orders of magnitude faster than that (timescale ~10^(-15) sec), so thinking of the atoms and molecules as \"fixed\" in space would be an excellent picture of them on that timescale. Thinking about an electrical conductor, instead of an H^+ transfer medium, for instance.",

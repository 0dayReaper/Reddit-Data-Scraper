            "comment": "The geomagnetic poles have indeed wandered extensively during the last 10,000 years. However, I could not find a specific source that provides the precise information about the date and distance of the closest proximity between the magnetic and geographic North Poles during that period.\r  \n\r  \nThe study by Ohno and Hamano (1992) is an important reference for the geomagnetic pole movement, but it does not provide the exact information you are looking for. The website you mentioned (poleshift.com) is not a scientific source, and its content should be taken with caution.\r  \n\r  \nIn general, precise information about the geomagnetic poles' movements in the past can be challenging to obtain due to the limitations in our ability to reconstruct the Earth's magnetic field. The available data come from studying rocks, sediments, and ice cores, which provide a snapshot of the Earth's magnetic field at the time they were formed. The resolution of this data can be limited, and thus may not provide the exact date and distance of the closest proximity between the magnetic and geographic North Poles during the last 10,000 years.\r  \n\r  \nFor more accurate and up-to-date information on this topic, you may want to consult scientific literature, such as articles published in peer-reviewed journals, or reach out to experts in the field of geomagnetism.",

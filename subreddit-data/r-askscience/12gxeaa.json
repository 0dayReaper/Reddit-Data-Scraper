Why is this not a viable option for humans as well? It seems our options are confined to deet and permethrin as the only viable solutions which are generally one-use treatments.",

It's even prescribed for a couple months at a time for severe acne cases. It's usually not more than 4 months or so due to risk of resistance and it does indeed screw with the body some as time goes on, though it all usually clears up after stopping a while. \n\nAs someone concerned about antibiotic resistance, its widespread use is nothing an individual can do anything about, but there's no reason not to take it if you're using it as an anti-malarial or similar. Made me nauseous for half an hour every time after I took mine for that reason... Still preferable to malaria.",

You can spray permethrin on both sides of your clothes to kill ticks that get under your clothes, but if the ticks don't touch the permethrin they won't be affected. \n\nI would assume what they were saying was they were wearing tick-repellant clothing specifically and that permethrin would allow them to wear more breathable clothes. I bought a supposed tick-repellant pair of pants once and it was made of a synthetic material that was much hotter and less breathable.",

Rather, these percentages directly translate to relative risk reduction (see [a basic explainer by the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson3/section6.html)): it means there is a 80% reduction of cases in vaccinated persons with respect to unvaccinated persons. It could very well\nbe that instead of there being 20% of people in the population where the vaccine \"does not take\" (which is one *possible* explanation for the number), this reduction in cases comes from some \"minimum virus threshold\" that's higher after vaccination. The latter would mean that any vaccinated person can still get the disease, they're just less likely to than if they were not vaccinated. \n\n(This is not meant negatively towards the parent poster here, thanks for correctly citing your source!)",

This vaccine was very odd, it didn't protect the human, it counted on the tick sucking your blood with the antibodies, and it treated the tick. \n\n\n&gt; Unlike most vaccines, which stimulate a person\u2019s immune system to make antibodies that fight off a germ once it enters the person, LYMErix instead \u201cimmunized\u201d the tick against its own dangerous bacteria. If a tick were to take a sip of a vaccinated person\u2019s blood\u2014now full of bacteria-neutralizing antibodies\u2014the pathogens in the tick\u2019s gut would be killed before they could be transferred to the human.\n\n[We Used to Have a Lyme Disease Vaccine.

For a 10% reduction without any side effects, it seems like a pretty good deal. For a 10% reduction with a 10% chance for birth defects in your future children, it may not be worth the risk.",

In his book on the Cutter Incident\u2014a disastrous episode in the mass distribution of the Salk polio vaccine\u2014and its impact on vaccine production, vaccine historian Paul Offit described what happened with LYMErix as a story about liability. The Lyme vaccine was an optional shot, so it wasn\u2019t covered by the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. (The program was set up in the 1980s to encourage pharmaceutical companies to continue production of vaccines by reducing the fear of liability.) Because of that exemption from the federal program, writes Offit, there was no cushion between the manufacturers of LYMErix and anyone who might claim it caused their arthritis. The vaccine \u201cwas left to survive the abuses of personal injury lawyers and the inaccurate media reports that inevitably follow.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt was more than just low demand. Anti-vaxxers strike again. \n\nhttps://slate.com/technology/2021/07/lyme-vaccine-history-lymerix-hesitancy-ticks.html",

The preventive stuff we give our pets is so that the ticks will die when they start sucking blood. It is not necessarily to prevent them from biting but to make sure the exposure time is short. By checking yourself and removing any potential ticks sooner rather than later you get similar results.\n\nThere's also other vaccines that are still in research.",

            "comment": "Most of the drugs (chemicals) we use on animals are not the best chems in the world, but we make the decision that risk to animal from chemicals is small compared to risk from ticks and fleas.  We require higher safety for use on humans, because 1) the risk to humans from insects is lower, and 2) human health and safety is treated more strictly than pet health and safety.\n\nLots of other reasons too, but most drugs or topical antiparasite compounds aren't super safe and are not doing nothing at all to the chemistry of the animal being treated.  We prefer to only prescribe them to humans when they are definitely needed, when the risk from the disease is real so the risk from the chemicals themselves is less important.\n\nYou can argue about whether our pets should be given the same level of safety that we give humans, but the simple fact is that we generally do not.  Part of the thinking is that we avoid dosing the humans by preventing the transfer of the parasites or carriers from the pet right off the bat (by dosing the animals as a preventative measure), rather than coming in later and trying to fix the infection to the human.\n\nLots of chems that get used for animals but are seen as unfit for humans.",

Say we find out something increases cancer risk past 10 years, many animals might not live long enough for that to be an issue or the risk is worth the treatment. 5% of animals dying to a side effect of a drug isn't huge especially if it saves more than that, 5% lethality rate in humans would be unacceptable especially since we come into contact with ticks significantly less. We just need to do way more studies and more long term studies of medication to make sure its safe for human use.",

A medication with a serious 5% complication rate (especially a 5% mortality) would absolutely never be approved in veterinary medicine and would 100%  never be prescribed for parasite prevention. \n\nSafety studies for veterinary drugs are incredibly thorough and not as lax as you make them seem. \n\nThe isoxazolines and macrocyclic lactones (current most commonly used parasite preventatives) have adverse effect rates in the fractions of a percent. \n\nIn addition, veterinary species in general have shorter life spans, faster aging, and similar rates of age associated disease as humans in their various life stages. If a drug causes cancer in humans after 10 years, there is a high likelihood it would do the same in dogs and cats after 1-2 years.",

Whereas, the transmission fastest time for Ehrlichia transmission is just 1 hour. I tell this to owners who argue that they give preventives for ectoparasites. They're not very effective if exposure to ticks is pretty much 24/7. Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are really hard to control given the quick transmission time and pathogenesis. My former professor had several studies about downregulating certain antioxidants in ticks with the goal of \"poisoning them from blood feeding\". I recall bringing up pathogen transmission time as a problem and he pretty much agreed (like most experts in the field) that tick control is a better and cost effective solution. We won't even have to deal with parasiticide resistance. (It's a huge problem since the US cattle industry suffered for 40 years before being able to create a new parasiticide for resistant ticks)",

There\u2019s little evidence on what the minimum amount of time for transmission is. There\u2019s some clinical evidence for transmission in under 24 hours, and under 16 hours in animal models (happy to share sources for those interested!). Also, western blot is known to be prone to false negatives and not a reliable measurement of infection, especially if not done in the proper window as the other comment or mentioned. The literature and medical recommendations really conflict a lot of times. I hope there will be more research in the future. We\u2019re seeing a shift in the way long term effects of infections are treated due to Long COVID so hopefully this will extend to Lyme!",

Are these vaccines a result of refining current immunotherapy practices?\n\nAnd as sort of a bonus question, would these vaccines make a breakthrough to treating most cancer cases? I\u2019ve heard some say that these vaccines are more like stop gaps than an actual tool for complete remission, but it sounds promising given that the vaccines can be personalized.",

            "comment": "Cancer vaccines are targeted against antigens which only or predominantly exist in cancer cells in order to stimulate the immune system against it. Often this is done by introducing RNA, coding for the respective antigen(s). There are two major hallmarks that make this a complicated task.\n\na) it is far from trivial to choose the correct antigen(s). Besides them really needing to be specific for the cancer, you also face a rapidly mutating environment and massive differences between patients. This is also why personalized therapies are a thing (like biontechs inest approach) in development. This is in top of cancer being not one single illness, but hundreds.\n\nb) you need to deliver a substantial amount of the antigen coding RNA via the correct route, also targeting the correct tissue etc. This is far from trivial, since you at best want to be precise, but end up rather systemic with nuances.\n\nThese two things are not that complicated in, let's say, infectious diseases, such as COVID, where you have a pretty distinct target (like spike) and also can be pretty systemic with the administration.",

I just want to mention there are other cancer immunotherapies where they inject genetically engineered antibodies that target the cancer (e.g. CAR-T cells).  While not technically a vaccine, it does use the immune system to attack the cancer.",

            "comment": "Cancer vaccines are receiving more limelight these days because of the success and promise from the COVID-19 vaccines. However, in my opinion, this is isn't due to their actual therapeutic potential. \n\nI've been in cancer immunotherapy research for the last 12 years or so and have a PhD focused on T cell-based cancer immunotherapy. I don't see vaccination as a viable route for **treating** cancer as monotherapy. If you search the literature, there are publications almost yearly for the last 20 years highlighting the progress of cancer vaccines and how they are just around the horizon. Although this isn't to say its not useful to continue researching and exploring the potential.\n\n* The reality is that cancer is highly adaptable and is capable of employing the regulatory and homeostatic pathways and mechanisms evolved in humans to control and limit adaptive immune responses. \n\n* De novo (meaning newly generated) immune responses produced by a vaccine take 1-3 weeks to mature, which is **too slow** for a therapeutic strategy. The heterogeneous nature of cancer means that a slow attack results in change and selection of subpopulations that are resistant to that attack - such as by losing the antigens of target. Researchers have attempted to overcome this by creating vaccines against a slew of neo-antigens present in a patient as a highly-targeted personalized medicine. However this is extremely arduous and expensive, and does not get around the slow kinetics. In fact, in most patients with cancers bearing mutations already have infiltration by lymphocytes targeting those epitopes, but the cancer has shut down those cells - hence the success of checkpoint blockade therapy which seeks to liberate these anti-tumor T cells. \n\nNow there are avenues where cancer vaccines do have a lot of potential. In cases where the [vaccine is an oncolytic virus has more potential](https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-4598-12-103) because the treatment now is a dual-hit approach. Alternatively, cancer vaccines may be useful in cell-based immunotherapy approaches such as with T or NK cells where the vaccine can boost the transferred cells. [This is currently under clinical trials to improve the efficacy of CAR T cells](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aay5967?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed). This is particularly pertinent because if you ask almost anyone in the cancer immunotherapy field, the consensus is that combination strategies are the way of the future, especially in solid cancers. No single treatment will be effective for the entire population.  \n\nThe fact is vaccines are great at prevention, and are less useful therapeutically in a setting where the disease state is established. If we could know what cancer we might get, they are wonderful. Look at the success of the HPV vaccines in preventing virally-induced cervical and penile cancers! For most other cancers of non-viral origin, it is much much more complicated. It is almost impossible to know which mutations a cancer may have in most cases (with a few select exceptions), and generating an immune responses against host tissues is risky due to the potential of auto-immunity, so the antigen has to be VERY selective to mutated or oncofetal antigens that are not seen in the body normally. Achieving regulatory approval for a vaccine that may prevent a cancer one day would require a massive trial spanning multiple decades to prove statistical benefit.",

            "comment": "If you are \"lucky\" to have a specific antigen produced only by the cancerous cells it's great since you will have chances that the vaccine will really target only the cancerous cells.\n\nThe vaccine would be great if it would be mainly CD4  activation and the cancerous cells won't evolve to hide from the immune system. The antibodies will  have to be efficient even in acidic environment since some cancerous clusters are creating an acidic environment. So it will be another great tool to help people but won't work 100% since the cancerous cells are unfortunately able to evolve quite quickly and create \"non-natural\" environment that are not always predictable.",

            "comment": "Personalized medicine is the future, the problem now is that you need to get a cohort of enough \"sameness\" to overcome (necessary) regulatory oversight. If we're talking specific drivers of disease that's pretty restrictive to success, because cancerous cells are usually the culmination of a few growth/survival-permissive mutations and the patients respond differently to agents targeting one aspect of their proliferation for more than just that reason. \n\nI'm an expert in the preclinical in vivo space breaking into human clinical trials, and can say with certainty that even genetically \"identical\" mice really aren't. Even given the same patient tumor engraftment in a group, you won't get similar \"take\" in terms of the tumor or response to the drug. Hell, even siblings will respond to anesthesia differently. \n\nI know I didn't answer your question directly, but I love the personalized medicine discussion because that's where I want to contribute my career efforts.",

Immunotherapies currently are what is known as checkpoint suppressor inhibitors, so rather than presenting an antigen or activating a specific pathway, they reduce the inhibition of the immune system, making it more likely to become sensitised to abnormal cells present in the neoplasm (hence the adverse event profile tending towards autoimmune activity).",

That's one of the things that makes it cancer. \n\nSo a normal vaccine won't work on cancer the same way it would on an infectious organism.\n\nA modified vaccine could potentially slow the cancer down, and that's what we seem to see in recent results. But you're giving this to an individual whos immune system didn't recognize the cancer in the first place, so anything you come up with to stimulate the immune system is going to have side effects.",

Several years ago I worked in the clinical development group of a biopharmaceutical company that had developed a cancer vaccine strategy which used unique antigens sequenced from patients' tumors and the results at that time were pretty meh. Since then, I don't think this methodology has been anything like the checkpoint inhibitors have been, but who knows, down the road something might emerge.",

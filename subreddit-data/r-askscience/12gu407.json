In fact, at least according to the last lit review I read about this, there is no simple mapping between facial expressions and emotions. I know this violates a lot of people\u2019s intuition and some previous research, especially by Paul Ekman, but it is the current state of the science nevertheless.",

In order to demonstrate a reliable and useful connection between the respondents' truthfulness and their emotions, you would have to perform an experiment in which the subjects were under similar psychological pressures to those that would occur when their honesty is questioned in the real world. But a lab experiment cannot (ethically) simulate the emotional stressors that would be present in the real world--potential job loss, arrest, etc. Thus, no matter how \"conclusive\" your lab data, any suggestion that those signals would still be detectable against the backdrop of emotional signals present in a real-life scenario is nothing more than speculation.  \n\nTo even approach a confirmation of the utility of polygraphs, microexpression analysis, etc., you would need a retrospective study of data obtained from people who were actually being questioned in the same circumstances in the real world, and whose truthfulness could be ascertained by independent means. Trying to obtain such a data set would be very challenging, and still subject to all sorts of questions about sample selection in the first place.\n\nSo, I know the answer isn't very satisfying, but I would consider virtually any attempt to claim scientific support for such an endeavor to be hopelessly flawed from the start.",

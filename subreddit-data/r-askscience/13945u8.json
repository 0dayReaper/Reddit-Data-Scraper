A single dose of 1g of azithromycin would be the closest thing we have, but that would typically consist of two 500mg pills, and is no longer a preferred course of therapy. The reason it's no longer preferred is that many bacteria (including C. trachomatis) have been developing increasing levels of resistance to the drug, and even when it was still preferred, it was never 100% effective. Even if everybody correctly took the full course of medication at the same time, the expected failure rate of (at minimum) \\~2% would be more than enough to ensure the continued survival of the C. trachomatis species.",

Azithromycin 1g is used if a patient is pregnant, and you can also use levofloxacin 500mg (once a day) x 7 days.\n\nAlso, they are pushing for expedited partner therapy (EPT) which means that if you find out you have chlamydia, you can get a prescription for your sexual partner the same time you get your own. It\u2019s pretty neat because if someone has huge barriers blocking care, they can still get treated \u201cvia\u201d their partner.\n\nFun fact, if you contract gonorrhea, and if chlamydia cannot be ruled out, they give you the doxy regimen to treat it - gonorrhea is just one quick intramuscular shot of ceftriaxone. It also has EPT, cefixime 800mg (if chlamydia ruled out in source pt). Ez. Hope someone reads this and asks about EPT/tell a friend about it, because it\u2019s a step in the right direction for accessible STI treatments for both partners.",

Or is that something the pharmacist should handle?",

I\u2019ve had MANY people do what you just mentioned; I\u2019ll ask if they\u2019re allergic to azithromycin and patients will get a little upset. Usually a response is similar to \u201cNo!! I\u2019m allergic to AZPACK! *followed by something akin to \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can trust you guys, always getting stuff wrong, you could hurt me.\u201d* I wish I was kidding. Then of course you have to figure out what they mean by \u201cAzPacks\u201d, but we\u2019ve heard almost every single way to (mis)-pronounce the most common 1,000 drugs or so, never feel bad if you butcher it. You\u2019re attempting, and that\u2019s awesome. \n\nOnce again, I don\u2019t blame em. Trying to ascertain if you need amlodipine or amiodarone, fluoxetine or duloxetine, prednisone or prednisolone, chlordiazePOXIDE or chlorproPAMIDE (that\u2019s why we use tall man lettering), and so on and so forth. When patients call in for refills, I usually just go down their list and ask if they need their heart med, cholesterol med, thyroid etc instead of making them pronounce names. I do always try to help teach patients (difficult) the brand and generic names, as it was shocking at first to see so many people have no idea what their meds are called.",

You can be treated for both gonorrhea and chlamydia at the same time, but there's no overlap in the treatment anymore.\n\nYou might be confused and thinking of when gonorrhea used 1g of azithromycin in addition to the ceph.",

Sure.  But it would take a level of funding and international coordination beyond our current capacity.  And it wouldn\u2019t even be a good use of our energy, relative to other stuff we could be doing.  \n\nMoreover, for that level of effort, we could more easily develop a chlamydia vaccine and make  it widely available.  We would have *some* of the same anti-vax issues that we have with the Covid vaccine.  That being said, we\u2019ve seen from the HOV vaccine and interest in the HIV vaccine that people are really enthusiastic about preventing STIs in ways that don\u2019t require celibacy or condoms.   \n\nThe other reason we *shouldn\u2019t*?  Because giving antibiotics to everyone on earth is a terrible idea.  Antibiotics do more to your system than just kill one specific bacteria.  \n\nWe don\u2019t know what would happen if everyone was given them at once. We *might* end up killing off a ton of other bad germs too. Yay!  Except we also might permanently screw up the human gut microbiome in a way that destroys society.   We just don\u2019t know. \n\nOk, now onto the fun part, \n\n#Why It Would Work:\n\nYou don\u2019t need to catch every single case to drop carrier rates so far an STI is functionally eradicated in a region.  \n\nWe actually have a very good example of that from quite recently.  \n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, the style for pubic hair in the United States shifted dramatically.  The big bush of the 70s and 80s was long gone, but the real change was the adoption of fully shaved / waxed. \n\nAs this style caught on, some researchers noticed that [pubic lice cases were going down](https://www.wired.com/2014/09/pubic-lice-still-not-going-extinct/) precipitously, even as STI rates were climbing a bit.  \n\nPubic lice weren\u2019t *entirely* eliminated, but we also never had anywhere close to 50% of adults shaving their pubes.  \n\nWhat if we could get everyone to shave or wax  their pubes on the same day?  We would almost certainly eliminate pubic lice for good. That\u2019s an experiment actually worth running.",

            "comment": "Chlamydia trachomatis can cause a range different clinical syndromes depending on the location that it infects. When we colloquially refer to Chlamydia we are usually referring to it infecting the cervix (for women) or the urethra (for men and women). These are generally less severe/invasive infections that historically were treated with one dose of azithromycin. The new CDC STI guidelines now suggest that our first line treatment should be doxycycline twice a day for seven days. This is in part because Chlamydia can also cause proctitis (infection of the rectum) which can be harder to treat and potentially asymptomatic at time of presentation. The idea of the longer course of doxycycline is to better treat potentially under-diagnosed proctitis which can cause re-infection of the cervix or urethra after just the single dose of azithromycin. \n\nChlamydia trachomatis also has different serovars which cause different clinical syndromes. Some serovars require only a single dose of antibiotics to treat -- for example the serovars A-C that infect the eye and cause the condition trachoma which can lead to blindness only need a single dose of azithro. Other serovars require a longer course antibiotics --for example the serovars L1-L3 which can cause a disease called lymphogranuloma venereum where you get pus filled lymph nodes in your groin and requires 3 weeks of antibiotics.\n\nSo yeah, not as straightforward as one would initially think. Chlamydia trachomatis also is not a zoonoses as some people are suggesting and is not transmitted to humans from animals.",

The reason it's no longer preferred is that many bacteria (including C. trachomatis) have been developing increasing levels of resistance to the drug, and even when it was still preferred, it was never 100% effective.\n\nWhat they used to do if someone continued experiencing symptoms after a single dose is give them a longer course of treatment, but that\u2019s no longer considered a good idea because of the resistance issue. Also, chlamydia can often be asymptomatic, so people who take a single dose may actually remain infected without knowing it.",

It does not have other known hosts. \n\n*Chlamydia pneumoniae*, the other species within the genus that commonly causes disease in humans, also has no animal reservoir, and doesn't cause the STI we call chlamydia (instead, as the name suggests, it commonly causes pneumonia).\n\nThe various species in the *Chlamydia* genus that infect domesticated animals are not the same bacteria that cause the human STI. While some are a concern to possibly jump to humans, most currently are not known to do so. *C. psittaci* is the only one that does occasionally transmit from pet birds or poultry to humans, but it causes respiratory psittacosis, not the disease we call chlamydia. There are only extremely rare reports of, eg., *C. felis* (the species found in cats) causing conjunctivitis in humans.",

Vaccines teach the body how to prevent its own illness, antibiotics are basically poison for various microbes. That\u2019s why they trash your stomach flora. They don\u2019t provide any long term immunity, and I\u2019ll get to why thats important in part 3. \n2.\tthe idea of \u201ccertainty\u201d with either of them is a complete crapshoot. There\u2019s no such thing as a 100% effective treatment because immune response variance exists. Someone with no immune system is rendered useless for either of these treatment options. Putting those together we get:\n3.\tthere\u2019s a big difference between the years of constant generational vaccination that it took for us to wipe out smallpox, and \u201cwhat if everyone took a drug that probably kills this thing\u201d. Smallpox was eradicated by a consistent long term shrinking of its reservoirs. It didn\u2019t happen overnight, even once the majority of the population was vaccinated, some people got the vaccine and still got it. The difference is that those people couldn\u2019t then pass it on. The above situation would remove that generational progress because the one dude with no immune system who still has it at the end of a course of antibiotics cuz he has no immune system(and with the fact that the most common immune compromise disorder in America is ALSO an STD means that guy is statistically almost certain to be out there, right now, not wrapping his fucken tool) would then just go pass it on to someone else and we\u2019d be back to square one.\n\nSo yeah not even a little bit of an argument because the idea of a drug being 100% effective is a nothing argument that doesn\u2019t ever ever ever happen at a scale of 7 billion people.",

Not fun. \n\nNice factoid about PrEP: two most common combination drugs are **Truvada** and **Descovy.** They are very very similar except for the form of the second combo drug: \n\n**Truvada** is (Emtricitabine + Tenofovir **disoproxil fumarate**) \n\nand\n\n **Descovy** (Emtricitabine + Tenofovir **alafenamide**) \n\u2014\u2014- notice the salts of tenofovir are different, Truvada has TDF while Descovy has TAF. TAF enters HIV cells more efficiently than TDF, which means you only have to use 25mg of TAF in Descovy but 150-300mg of TDF in Truvada. TAF has less side effects compared to TDF, and you use 10% of the dose, so less reactions in patients. \n\nLast two odd fun facts about PrEP: If you were born a biological woman, Descovy isn\u2019t approved for you. Why? Because the studies they preformed only had (born) biological male participants. The name of the study? PROUD. Yup, not kidding. Lastly, it reduces sexual HIV transmission by 99%, BUT it also is used for IV drug users - it reduces HIV transmission (via shared needles/supplies) by 75%",

Yes, kidney and bone issues are more common with Truvada/TDF than Descovy/TAF, but cholesterol and weight gain issues were higher with TAF. And these issues were relatively minor as far as side effects go.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that TDF is available as a generic now while Gilead will have the patent on Descovy until the 2030s. So there is a financial incentive for Gilead to get people to switch.",

            "comment": "Nah, eradicating chlamydia by having everyone take a pill and abstain for a week would not actually work. Here are the reasons why:\n\n1. Compliance would be terrible. Telling everyone on Earth to not have sex for a week is unrealistic. Most people wouldn't actually follow that advice. So not enough people would be abstinent long enough to fully clear the infection. \n\n2. Chlamydia has an incubation period. The bug that causes chlamydia, Chlamydia trachomatis, can survive inside someone for weeks before symptoms show up and get tested/treated. So any infections present at the time of the pill would still be transmissible after a week of \"down time\". \n\n3. Reinfection is possible. Chlamydia is highly transmissible, and a vaccinated or previously infected person is not necessarily immune to getting infected again in the future after abstaining. They could get exposed to another strain of the bacteria that leads to reinfection. \n\n4. Asymptomatic infections go unnoticed and untreated. A large percentage of chlamydia infections do not show any symptoms but can still be transmissible. Without symptoms, people may not even consider getting tested and treated. So the infection could persist in asymptomatic carriers who wouldn't know to abstain.\n\n5. There are too many alternative hosts. As long as chlamydia has other potential hosts in animals like koalas, it could continue to re-emerge and spread to humans even after being cleared from human populations. Animal reservoirs of the infection would allow it to crop back up in humans again. \n\nIn short, chlamydia is too adept, transmissible, and persistent to be truly eradicated by a single global abstinence and pill campaign. Containment and management are more realistic goals. Widespread testing, treatment, safer sex practices, and education will have a better chance of reducing chlamydia rates than trying to eliminate it altogether.",

You have to account for people who can't or won't follow the eradication protocol for some reason.\n\n2. The treatment itself is not magic. Some people will be more or less responsive depending on their genetics and current state of overall health. Consider as an example that th COVID vaccine wouldn't work for immunocompromised patients.\n\n3. Some viruses and especially bacteria can survive outside of the human body. Check this out for an example of bacteria and viruses hiding in unexpected places in nature.\n\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sciencealert.com/ancient-15000-year-old-viruses-found-in-melting-tibetan-glaciers/amp\n\n\nThese reasons are why we still vaccinate children against polio even though the WHO declared polio to be \"eradicated\". The reality is that isolated cases still pop up here and there. It's still out there it's just highly contained and very rare.",

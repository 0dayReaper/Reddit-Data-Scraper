I was curious if ML had bee applied to this type of data yet, and if so what type of ML and what were the findings? I find applying ML to social behavior or things like that interesting. Thanks",

            "comment": "Most terrestrial mammal migration patterns have been known for centuries. These are some of the oldest data sets on the planet; entire cultures\u2014and some hominid species\u2014were built on knowing these patterns.\n\nML requires a lot of covariates. This is where large-scale data collection becomes challenging. We\u2019re getting better at developing algorithms to discern crops, eco-region scale vegetative biomass, and even oceanic plankton blooms from satellite imagery but refining these algorithms and having the kind of data on the scale necessary to make ML a reasonable tool just isn\u2019t there yet.\n\nSource: MS in wildlife and fisheries sciences and senior DS in FAANG.\n\nEdit: nice username. Take off on Zappa\u2019s \u201cmoving to MT Soon\u201d or are you really moving to Wyoming?\n\nEdit 2: oh. You\u2019re moving to Laramie! I used to live there.",

            "comment": "probably?\n\n[the theory attributes consciousness to a self-connected lattice network] (https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/12/1160), and GoL is basically just a grid network with very nonlinear activation rules.\n\na while back, i actually set up a game of life network to analyze with a version of the [IIT 3.0 code] (https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003588) like what's in the lattice paper above, such a network will certainly be composed of a huge number of causal mechanisms, which implies that the system would have a reasonable amount of overall integrated information. the newer versions of the theory would find the same thing.\n\nthe open question is *how much* of the grid would be conscious according to IIT - my hunch is probably it would condense into lots of connected but separate entities.\n\n**\n\nit's not very hard to build a model (and the corresponding transition probability matrix) for a GoL network. and the version 4.0 formalism code is online for anyone to use (https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi). so you could try to answer the question for yourself (though it gets computationally prohibitive for networks bigger than 10 units or so, so...)",

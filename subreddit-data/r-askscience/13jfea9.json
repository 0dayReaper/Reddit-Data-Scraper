Our speed is generally to high for them to follow for long times\n\nBut when we take in ballast water there is a risk of taking small fish, or eggs, in the tanks that can be discharged in totally new waters where they than ere invasive... For this reason we have a ballast water management plan to minimise and prevent this. And all/most vessels are in these years getting a ballast treatment system installed to kill these specimens to avoid the spread of invasive species in the ballast water...\n\nAnother source of spreading is by hull growth, here the paint is an important part to avoid this. In the old days it was usually a highly toxic paint, but that is prohibited today. The newest technology is self polishing silica paint, so the paint is always smooth and clean without growth",

In this sediment you can have small organisms (mainly copepods) living inside. They are quite happy with a fresh supply of food everytime ballast water is pumped in. \n\nThis is why during install of a bwts it's vital to clean out the tanks.",

The notable exception is the pilot fish, which are named because of their prediliction for following ships around. But they have evolved to specialize in following sharks around, for protection and endoparacistism.",

They seek to maximize energy gain while minimizing cost. And again, its not about the speed per se, plenty of fish can keep up, its just that there is virtually no reason to, and traveling at high speeds is a waste of energy, unless you are hunting.",

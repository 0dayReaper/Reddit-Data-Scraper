            "comment": "I think you're asking, Can you put the gene for a monoclonal antibody into a person, have that gene produce the antibody, and have that antibody provide protection?\n\nYes, of course you can do that, and it's been done for decades experimentally. From a 2002 paper:\n\n&gt;Our concept calls for an antibody gene of choice to be transferred to muscle where the antibody molecule is synthesized and distributed to the circulatory system. In these experiments, we used a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector to deliver the gene for the human antibody IgG1b12 to mouse muscle. Significant levels of HIV-neutralizing activity were found in the sera of mice for over 6 months after a single intramuscular administration of the rAAV vector. \n\n-[Generation of Neutralizing Activity against Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 in Serum by Antibody Gene Transfer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC136414/) \n\nBut there are large disadvantages to this approach that make it experimental at the moment. \n\nIn particular, you need quite a lot of antibody to confer protection across the whole body. There's a really simple way to get large amounts of antibody, which is the way that was invented many decades ago -- the standard way of producing a mAb, in a vat, followed by purifying the antibody and injecting into people. \n\nIf you want the person to produce lots of antibodies over a long period, we also know how to do that very safely: Vaccination, which has been around for hundreds of years with a very, very high safety and effectiveness profile. \n\nPutting the gene into people, and essentially getting them to be the vat, doesn't have a lot of upside compared to the well understood standard process. If you're using DNA-based approaches, there is also some safety concern - can it insert into the genome and lead to aberrant gene expression, potentially cancer? Gene therapy has been around for a long time, but it's used mainly in people who are otherwise pretty sick, and on a small scale. Monoclonal antibodies are used in a much broader range of people, so there are more people, with otherwise low hazards, who might be put at risk this way.\n\nRNA treatment is safer in many ways, because it's often very short-term -- like the mRNA vaccines. But of course, if you are only delivering the mAb for a very short period, then what's the advantage over a nice simple protein injection? \n\nStill, this is being looked at experimentally (for example, [Engineered mRNA-expressed antibodies prevent respiratory syncytial virus infection](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06508-3) and [Nebulized mRNA-Encoded Antibodies Protect Hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 Infection](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/advs.202202771)). \n\nBut once again, you have to ask what problem you're trying to solve. We have great, well understood ways of producing antibodies now. Why is a new, potentially risky, way better?\n\nThe most likely place where this would be useful is in conditions where standard vaccination doesn't work well -- in particular, against HIV. Using this approach, you could ensure that a treated person produces the highly specific, but usually very rare, antibodies that are actually protective against a wide range of HIV strains.  This is likely the most active area for this work, with at least one clinical trial under way in humans:\n\n&gt;In this study, we administered a recombinant bicistronic adeno-associated virus (AAV8) vector coding for both the light and heavy chains of the potent broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody VRC07 (AAV8-VRC07) to eight adults living with HIV.  ... These data represent a proof of concept that adeno-associated viral vectors can durably produce biologically active, difficult-to-induce bnAbs in vivo, which could add valuable new tools to the fight against infectious diseases.\n\n--[Safety and tolerability of AAV8 delivery of a broadly neutralizing antibody in adults living with HIV: a phase 1, dose-escalation trial](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01762-x#Bib1)",

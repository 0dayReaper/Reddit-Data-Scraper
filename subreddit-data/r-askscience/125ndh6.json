    "postText": "I've been doing some work on personal trauma recently, and I'm curious about how the body responds to these sort of things. Food can often bring up a lot of memories (smell being a powerful sense, of course).\n\nSpecifically, I remember having porridge a lot for breakfast as a child - pretty robust breakfast I suppose, with carbs, fibre and some protein. I've not had it in a long time, but had it again more recently and felt I'd been hanging on to more weight than usual, when I look at the scales.\n\nGiven childhood, in my case, was often filled with a myriad of stress-inducing situations, including fast-paced mornings where breakfast was often eaten quickly, I wondered if there's any link between specific foods (more than just nutritional connections, like carbs, etc.) and the circumstances in which we first had it that might contribute to how we process foods, excluding potential factors like speed of eating (I understand that can affect these things also)?\n\nCould the stressful situation of childhood breakfast times that perhaps triggers some evolutionary mechanism in my body that thinks it would be better to process certain foods in different ways?\n\nI.e., body thinks something is in trouble in stressful situation, decides that circumstances might be difficult, decides to put food into fat storage for resources, situation repeats and food becomes associated with particular mode of processing.\n\nThis could be absolute nonsense, but I wondered if there might be any robust scientific literature on this based on my own limited understanding of ourselves, even if it disproves this. Given how complex our body is though, and the connections it can make between particular things related to trauma, it's a question that sounds interesting to explore.\n\nI suppose it might be referred to as a psychosomatic connection - I've heard that term thrown around, but happy to be corrected on that.",

            "comment": "Your gut microbiome is mostly bacteria that helps to breakdown and make food nutrients available. Those gut bacteria have learned to create brain chemicals that influence the \u201cyou are what you eat\u201d loop. https://youtu.be/VzPD009qTN4\n\nIn nature many animals find various ways of transferring these microflora bacteria to their off spring (birth, lactation, regurgitation, grooming, coprophagia, etc). In humans we delay the introduction of solid foods until a baby has developed their gut to be able to process and literally crave that food. We train our offspring with food culture and norms about how and what we eat. Stressful environments with food insecurity issues create a host of natural responses and learned behavior. It was only fairly recently we discovered that ulcers, often made worse by stress, is a bacteria designed to penetrate the protective acidic barrier of the stomach and gate keeper to our intestinal gut colony. The recent phenomenon of poop bacteria transfers combined with dietary changes is an attempt to help people make life style changes (usually weight loss). It is important that people also look at counseling as an important part of helping people with trauma, especially if there are food issues. Maybe in the future there will be \u201cnutritional psychologists\u201d to help people.",

Ice cream and tea among them.  A nurse told me I would find I didn\u2019t like them anymore after chemo and suggested I \u201csave\u201d something for after.  I didn\u2019t eat steak.  My all time favorite food!  She was absolutely correct and I\u2019m in her debt.  I used to eat a pint of ice cream almost every day before.  Now it does nothing for me.  I don\u2019t hate it.  I just don\u2019t want it anymore.",

            "comment": "To answer the question specifically, the nicotine acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) undergo something called [reversible desensitisation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006899306005130?via%3Dihub) after continued exposure to nicotine. Initially, there's an increase in ion conductance through the receptor, which is then followed by reversible desensitisation. That's why you feel a short high that decreases pretty quickly.\n\nFor chronic users, it's slightly different because the number of nAChRs is upregulated (meaning more of them are expressed) due to chronic exposure. So in that case they might need to smoke a bit more to compensate.",

                    "comment": "This is the correct answer. Yes, nicotine has a short half-life (~2ish hours) but really it is the desensitization and subsequent internalization of the receptors that limits the ability for whatever nicotine is left over to bind the receptors. This is an adaptive response as too much nicotinic activation can produce seizures.",

It's why they can detect THC in your system for months sometimes. They're looking for what the body breaks the drug down into in most cases I believe. Wish I could have given you a more concrete or scientific answer",

The byproducts last longer and are detectible for well past that.\n\nYou're right that most drug tests are searching for metabalytes not the product itself, but that's different from this circumstance/question.",

            "comment": "Somebody already pointed out the metabolites side.\n\nBut keep in mind that any compound will peak in concentration after you start taking it. It takes a little time to get into your blood and start having an effect. But once you stop taking the concentration will fall as your body metabolizes it. Once it falls below a certain level you stop feeling the direct effects. But it still present in your blood for some time after depending on the half life of that compound in the human body. \n\nIt\u2019s the same reason different medications have different dosing schedules. It\u2019s more evident in pediatrics. Too little does nothing, some gets you the therapeutic effect, too much damages you. That\u2019s why pediatricians dose based on weight. The calculation is derived from the metabolic rate and the therapeutic level of the medication. Adults can handle different ranges so often medications have a \u201ctypical\u201d dose, like antibiotics or ibuprofen. But in some cases the physicians may tune adults too.",

            "comment": "What you have to consider is that most drugs dont get eliminated in a linear manner. One prominent exception is alcohol, thats why you can easily extrapolate when youre approximatly sober. With most drugs however, this is not the case and they usually have a half life for their elimination rate. The decrease in blood concentration takes longer the lower your current concentration is. However nicotine has a relativly short half life of 2 h roughly so after 48 h we say that there is pretty much nothing left, but current analytical methods might still be able to detect these minor amounts.",

The feeling you experience may be transient but the nicotine will have an effect for many hours before it drops below an effective concentration... IF you're not habituated to it.",

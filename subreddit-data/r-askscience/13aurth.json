    "postText": "Hello everyone\n\nI've been studying neuro-pathology and have been having difficulty in understanding how the pathophysiology of PD results in its clinical manifestation. This probably has an obvious answer but I haven't been able to figure it out.\n\nWhat I've understood till now is that there's destruction of the dopamine-producing neurons in the Pars Compacta layer of the Substantia Nigra. Dopamine generally counters the normal inhibitory influence on motor activity in the Basal Ganglia so a decrease in dopamine would naturally make it harder to initiate muscle movement.\n\nThis would explain the bradykinesia, gait disturbances and dysarthria **but how would this result in rigidity and the resting pin-rolling tremor.** Why would this be seen when motor activity is already reduced?\n\nI'm a med student and haven't studied neuroscience in detail so I'm sure there's something I'm missing. I've consulted my textbooks and google but still haven't found an answer.\n\nAny insight would be greatly appreciated!",

            "comment": "What you're missing is that dopamine is only an exitatory neurotransmitter when it binds to D1-type receptors. When dopamine binds to D2-type receptors, it has an inhibitory effect. Among other regions, D2-type receptors are found in the external globus pallidus which projects to the basal ganglia and is part of how the brain controls movement. When dopamine levels drop, there is a loss of inhibition of unnecessary movement. This results in increased muscle tone (rigidity), tremors, and unwanted fine movements. \n\nThe way the human body is able to achieve wildly different effects from just a handful of neurotransmitters by expressing different receptor types is such an elegant adaptation. Have fun in your studies.",

Thus body will require more than normal dopamine for its receptors to react thus ACH action is not normalised unless you induce dopamine released by external means\n\n5) serotonin and noradrenalin. also contributes. \nIf excessive pleasure due to sex or drug that causing excess seretonin release body will remain in happy and relaxed state. To stress out body again and bring it to motion back MORE ACH is released and the excess ACH will lead to minor tremor (we called twitches)\n\n\nOther : GABA dysfunction",

            "comment": "one reason is that it's a small difference. the larger pupil dilation effects from sexual attraction (etc) are on the order of a 10% change in pupil area and thus in retinal illuminance. meanwhile, luminance discrimination thresholds are on the order of a few percent. so the change in retinal illuminance is, at most, just a bit more than you are minimally able to detect (meaning, it's perceptually pretty small).\n\nalso, the relation between increased illuminance and perceived brightness is already very compressive - for example if you increase the luminance of a target by 100%, it will only appear to be ~50% brighter. and this compression is greatly increased when you're talking about the entire scene/retina rather than a single target or object, because the retina as a whole has other gain control systems than just pupil diameter to more-or-less balance its sensitivity to current light conditions. (case in point: if you've ever had atropine put in your eyes to fully dilate your pupils, like at the eye doctor, you probably notice that everything is quite a bit brighter - but does it seem &gt;20x brighter? Probably not, but that's about the degree of increased retinal illuminance.)\n\nanother reason is that the retina is mainly built for transmitting *contrast* information, not mean luminance. it does transmit some information about the overall brightness of a scene, but even this is only weakly correlated to physical luminance, and for the most part the retina is sending signals about *ratios* of brightness between nearby positions - and this signal is *independent of retinal illuminance* (given that there's enough light to have any signal at all). more light just makes the contrast signal clearer, but doesn't make it stronger.\n\nso, while there probably is a perceptible effect of pupil change in these kinds of conditions (i can't find any studies where this is explicitly measured but they may exist), it's very small and probably masked by other much more significant content in the scene.",

You might change shutter speed a tad, or sensor sensitivity (iso) which might be like biological sensitivity, and imperceptible going from like 100 iso to 93 iso to keep it properly exposed.",

They also betray mental and emotional commotion. In fact, pupil dilation correlates with arousal so consistently that researchers use pupil size, or pupillometry, to investigate a wide range of psychological phenomena. ***And they do this without knowing exactly why our eyes behave this way.***",

                            "comment": "the tilde is doing a lot of work there.\n\napparent brightness depends on a lot of things (even avoiding the low-intensity regime, where there's definitely not a simple relation between transduction and stimulus), but completely free of context I am thinking not of Weber's law (the logarithmic relation) but of brightness as a power function (Stevens law) with exponent around 1/2. This is certainly true for the high-contrast regime of contrast perception (apparent contrast increases as a power function of stimulus contrast, with exponent around 0.4) - and I think it's reasonable (again, without context of background, adaptation state, etc) to direct this back to apparent brightness (since apparent contrast is exactly a matter of brightnesses and darknesses). \n\n(edit: taking all of that literally, you'd get an increase in brightness closer to 32% than 50% by doubling intensity - but again, it's a complicated question and one number is not going to be correct for all situations)\n\n(edit2: if you want a good examples of the complexity of the brightness/intensity relation, but also with a nice simplifying plot, see Whittle 1992 Brightness, Discriminability and the \u201cCrispening Effect\u201d, and check out Figure 10 for some extrapolations that actually kind of fit with something closer to the 50% number i threw out above\n\nclassic paper:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004269899290205W)\n\nAnyways, it's just a rough number.",

Painfully so, in the case I'm talking about. I think that other causes of dilated pupils besides drugs don't cause enough of a difference for it to be noticeable and your eyes are able to adjust quickly enough that it might only be bright for a few moments, i.e. going from pitch black to outside sun.",

The difference in brightness between \"bright\" and \"dark but I can still see after my eyes adjust\" is more than a thousand times larger than the difference in brightness from your pupil alone going from narrowest to widest.",

When you are going to make a muscle movement, your motor cortex will usually send an impulse to the corresponding sensory cortex to ignore the result of that action.

This hasn't been demonstrated for pupil dilation, but there does seem to be a difference in [internal vs. pharmacological dilation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9121535/) that is consistent with it.",

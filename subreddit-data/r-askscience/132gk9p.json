    "postText": "I was curious because I see many articles/announcements about trying to resurrect extinct species. But how about instead, is it possible to collect genetic material from museum and taxidermy collections to clone existing vulnerable and endangered species?\n\nMany species like cheetahs in the wild are trying to make a rebound but one of the topics brought up is the surviving members are all closely related making poor genetic diversity. Can science help those species by using DNA from older preserved specimens?",

            "comment": "Yes with a limitation. A couple of years back there was a black-footed ferret clone born for the first time and the motivation for cloning was explicitly in part to use older DNA to bring back a bit of the diversity that existed decades ago. If you have DNA from a much older specimen, preferably before a bottleneck event, you can clone it and reduce the risks of inbreeding.\n\nThe limitation is actually having the DNA. The ferret that was cloned was kept frozen for thirty years. There's no guarantee that the DNA will be intact enough to work from a preserved specimen because things like taxidermy are focused on keeping things recognizable rather than functional. Some cases it might work but if they aren't pulling specimens out of the ice the use will probably be fairly limited.",

            "comment": "Cloning is polar opposite to what genetic diversity is,, first off it avoids all pathways when crossing over and random orientation could occur (cause you don't essentially use gametes for procreation). Moreover, somatic cells of extinct species are probably unavailable to be used for in-vitro methods of cloning.",

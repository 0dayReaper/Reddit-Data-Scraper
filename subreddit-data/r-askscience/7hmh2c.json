            "comment": "Hi, medic here! It depends. For the sake of the conversation, I'm going to assume you mean something like a run-of-the-mill, basic cut. You nicked yourself shaving, or your knife slipped a little when you were cutting veggies. Nothing that would require sutures. \n\nTypically, its best to wash the cut with antibacterial soap (like Dial) and warm water, that probably constitutes \"wiping it away\", but only to get any dirt/nasties out of the cut. You do this because when you DO hold pressure to stop the bleeding, you don't want to keep the trapped nasties in there. So technically, it's better to take a little of column a, a little of column b. After your cut has been wiped clean, put steady pressure on it until it clots, then put a layer of protectant (neosporin or the like) and a bandage/bandaid/gauze over it to help it heal. \n\nNow, if you're talking about a trauma situation, it's a little different. Say, for example, you're first responding to a motorcycle accident and this dude's calf is just wrecked to hell, blood everywhere, gravel everywhere inside the laceration- your best bet isn't to keep wiping the gash continuously, you need to apply direct pressure first and foremost to stop the bleeding. Wiping it will do nothing and not allow the blood to clot properly. Pop a tourniquet on too. (This includes keeping the nasties and gravel and all, unfortunately, the hospital will properly clean and suture when they arrive. Motorcycle dude has bigger issues than a little dirt and gravel right now.) You don't want to be exsanguinated just because you kept wiping blood. Wiping continuously doesn't really promote clotting factors, nor allows platelets to form to stop the blood. It's why you are always taught \"direct pressure\" any time there is blood leaking from a wound that shouldn't be there. \n\nTL;DR: when in doubt, keep pressure on it. \n\nI hope this makes sense and answers your question, I'm on maternity leave, pregnant AF, insomnia and heartburn have kept me up for over a day. (: \n\nEdit: holy shit RIP inbox, I wake up because my son decided to falcon punch my bladder after I could finally go to sleep (weird sensation from the inside out) and I have 100+ comments, replies, and messages. Obligatory thank you for the gold! Now, a few clarity points:\n\nFor my first basic scenario, I used a common example of what might happen at home/what people have at home to use. Water and really any kind of soap is fine, Dial soap is just what I've been taught to use if I have it, and many of my colleagues do too. (I HATE it though, but I'm also allergic to a lot of other cleansing agents and have to stick with it.) Personally, I don't think water temperature is a difference/makes a difference in the basic cut situation. I cut myself in the shower shaving the other day (big 'ol 32w pregnant belly over here) and I just let it run in the shower, cleaned with soap, but it didn't clot until after I got out and put pressure. EVERY PERSON'S CLOTTING FACTOR IS DIFFERENT, your mileage may vary from others. It takes me 20 minutes to stop a simple little cut like that, whereas my husband just washes and slaps a bandaid on it and forgets about it in three minutes. \n\nOn using alcohol/sticking your finger in your mouth- as long as it's rubbing alcohol or peroxide, I don't see why you couldn't dab a bit on. We carry it in the ambulance in situations like this. (Since we don't exactly have a sink with soap and water.) If the drinking alcohol (high proof) you want to use is fresh/unopened, or ensure that nobody has drank from the bottle directly. I've never used drinking alcohol as a sanitizer, so I couldn't tell you. As for sticking your finger or cut in your mouth- I'm completely guilty of doing this too, but just keep in mind that human mouths are NASTY AF! We treat human bites wayyyy more aggressively than dog or animal bites (save for snakes, because venom). Human mouths are just... filthy. I learned how gross our mouths are and made a conscious effort to stop sticking my cut up hands/arms in my mouth. Google some human bites, and look at when they get infected. They aren't pleasant. After seeing some in the field and looking at the infections they harbor, I wouldn't ever consciously do it again- but I mean, you do you. Like I said, I'm guilty of it too, and I think it's a bit of a reflex if I'm honest. (So many people do it!) I'm too tired to do any link adding, so if someone wants to add it, I'll put it here. (:\n\nON TOURNIQUETS:\n\nA little background for those that don't know me: before I got off the truck due to my little parasite I have affectionately decided to raise, I work in a huge metropolitan area with a combo critical care/911 system. I'm mainly on the CCT (critical care transport) side, meaning we transferred people from hospital to hospital, higher level of care, etc. Got to see some gnarly stuff. We also backflowed our 911 areas when they got busy, so I've seen some crap there too. \n\nTourniquets are coming back into the mainstream. Using a tourniquet is simple, easy, and (in my opinion) should be part of a public safety course/first aid/CPR for civilians. You have HOURS (if tourniquet applied correctly) before you risk ANY harm to the limb. (And remember! Life &gt; limb, regardless. So that argument is out.) \n\nYou do not need to loosen it every fifteen minutes. That's the exact opposite of what you're trying to do. You do need to check for pulses in the extremity very frequently- if you feel one, readjust till there isn't one. Double tourniquets are a thing, I've had to do it on people before. You are restricting blood flow. A pulse means that the person has blood flow and they will continue to bleed out. Once you apply it, hospital staff need to be the ones removing it, not you. In my trauma scenario, I pictured a free flowing bloody calf that got ripped to shreds by a gravel road and is squirting blood that you can't stop with direct pressure alone. (Guess I should've said femoral, I wasn't thinking straight. Either way.) Put the tourniquet on the femoral artery, as high as you can, and cinch it tight. If that doesn't help, double tourniquet it. \n\nTourniquets are a very underrated emergency medical device, in my opinion. We carry several on the ambulance. They're good use for GSWs, deep cuts, lacerations, arterial bleeding from pretty much anywhere. It's easier to remove a tourniquet than remove a limb. We might use them more than you think. Open fractures that are bleeding and you can't put pressure on because bone is protruding, etc. They're very useful and can be used for several situations. \n\nAnother local EMS company near me actually does civilian first aid training, and they are doing a good job in removing public stigma around tourniquets in our huge metropolitan area. \"Stop the Bleed!\" is really great too. \n\nAs for in-field debridement: if I have the chance to squirt some saline and remove the dirt from a wound (and the bleeding IS CONTROLLED) I do en route to the hospital. If they're so messed up that I got called because of a GSW or severe accident, I'm going to be a little too busy maintaining airway, keeping BP up, etc to do much. We'll be at the facility that can take their time to clean it properly versus my crude knock-up job when I really need to focus on doing other things. If I have an extra hand or some firefighters, I might ask them to help me if I have everything else under control. (S/O to my fire guys, you rock!) \n\nI hope I answered all the questions and cleared some stuff up in the edit. I will totally try to get back to all that commented! Baby boy is craving some tacos, now I gotta go make some tacos at 7am... my husband will be very confused when he wakes up, lol. ",

I ran over to give first aid to one guy motionless on the ground. He did not have a pulse, so my first instinct was to start CPR; however he also was lying in a very large pool of blood. I hesitated because I didn't know whether to do CPR with such high blood loss. Should I have just done CPR anyway or was it not going to matter no matter what?",

If it's a trauma situation and the pool of blood is massive and they don't have a pulse, you'd probably be doing nothing but draining him more. \n\nThe protocols have changed from airway, breathing, circulation (ABC) to circulation, airway, breathing (CAB), for the fact that if you don't have anything (blood) to circulate, the rest is irrelevant.

A lot has changed in the last five years. \n\nNone of what you're telling me is accurate in the least, I've never even heard of releasing the tourniquet every 15 minutes- that's the complete opposite of what you're trying to do. There are HOURS before the affected limb suffers any kind of damage, be it nerve or vascular. Check for pulses every 15 minutes in the most distal point to the tourniquet. (e.g. slashed arm, tourniquet at shoulder, check for pulses at wrist- there shouldn't be a pulse if done correctly.) If there is a pulse, tighten the tourniquet until there isn't one. \n\nIn certain situations, you don't need to have arterial bleeding to warrant using a tourniquet. (Open fx, snake bite, large gaping wound, even large venous bleeding.) In a prehospital setting, I can't just stick my finger in the artery to stop blood from coming out. It's impractical, unsafe, and I'm sure as hell not trained to do that. Tourniquets safely stop blood flow until I get them to a trauma center where a trauma team and an OR can do a better job of plugging holes than I can. \n\nIf I'm applying a tourniquet to someone, they have bigger issues than a little nerve damage. And the nerve damage wouldn't be caused by me. I'm only with the patient for an hour at most, long term damage is noted after 8ish hours of restricted flow- by then, you should be out of surgery. Tourniquets are to preserve life. Life &gt; limb, always. Most people would take a little nerve damage versus either needing their whole arm chopped off or losing their life completely. ",

If blood is just pooling out or shooting out because an artery was hit, I am assuming that would justify one.  Also, is it worthwhile to write down the time one was placed on someone?",

Think trying to slow water loss in a long straw vs. trying to slow water loss in a barrel. It's probably easier and more effective to plug to hole for a barrel first where a straw would be best handled by pinching it up stream and sealing later.",

Wiping can irritate the wound, reopen it, and generally make the owner of the cut have an even worse day.\n\nPressure is key on cuts of any size. After cleaning it as well as you can, use something clean and preferably something without a lot of lint to apply pressure, as it can get stuck in the wound. Continue applying pressure until  A: It has sealed up on its own and the bleeding has stopped, or B: The wound can be properly stitched shut by someone trained to do so is it is large enough.\n\nBy applying pressure, you not only soak up the excess blood with the cloth/gauze/whatever, you are also leaving blood on the cut to harden and help close the cut and let it scab over.\n\nDon\u2019t pick the scab.",

Yes, blood coagulation is what stoops bleeding, but it\u2019s better if you clean the wound first \n\nIf it\u2019s a slash on the neck, or something like that, apply immediate pressure to the wound, improvise with a t-shirt or something. At that point all that matters is slowing the bleed before they shock out and die.\n\nSmaller cuts like on the finger, just pressure and wash it, and cover with a bandaid. Most bacteria would be washed out, and depending on what cut you, like if you were cutting onions or whatever, you\u2019ll be fine without a topical antibiotic. \n\nLarge arterial bleeds like if you\u2019re bleeding from the femoral (thigh) or brachial (upper arm) arteries, you\u2019re better off using a tourniquet, which can be easily improvised with a strip of cloth and a sturdy stick or something. I\u2019ve seen tourniquets improvised with a t-shirt and the spare barrel from an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon.\n\nOther bleeds like inguinal ( groin ) or axillary (armpit) require packing and pressure dressing, which is something best left to trained professionals. \n\n\nTl;dr \n\nHold pressure, call for help ",

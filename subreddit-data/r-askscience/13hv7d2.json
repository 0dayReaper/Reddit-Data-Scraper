    "postText": "I am getting ready to move to Asia later this year for a few years of traveling, and I'm reading up on the recommended vaccines. One of the recommended vaccines is the Japanese Enciphilitis vaccine.\n\nWhen reading about JEV, I read that pigs and some birds are common breeding grounds for the virus, then mosquitos will contract the virus from the diseased animal. However, humans can only contract the virus if they get bit by a diseased mosquito, and not if they eat the diseased animal. \n \nVirology/science has never been my strong point (I'm a financial advisor, so my strength is in finance/economics), so I don't understand how you don't get sick if you eat the diseased animal. Do our stomachs have some acids that breakdown certain viruses or something? Do viruses require special types of hosts to develop to the point it can affect humans?",

            "comment": "&gt;Do our stomachs have some acids that breakdown certain viruses or something?\n\nOne of the functions of stomach acid is precisely to inactivate many pathogens. Some evolve to resist that, but JEV is transmitted by mosquitoes and thus has no selection pressure to resist human stomach acid. Nor is there any pressure for evolution of a way to dock to the lining of the intestines and cross into the body proper. This is doubly so since humans are not the main host for JEV - it's mostly a virus that lives in pigs and birds, with mosquitoes transferring it from host to host.",

The part of the virus that binds to cells are made of proteins. If the enzymes break down the proteins on the surface of the virus, for example, the virus cannot infect. Also viruses can be very fragile too and the stomach acid itself might be enough to inactivate it. People often confuse severity of viral disease with virus stability and that is not so. Many viruses are easily killed in the right conditions. The stomach is one of those.",

This complex life cycle is probably the answer to your question.

That\u2019s not really ELI 5, so I\u2019ll explain it further. Basically the virus is transmitted between wild animals and humans with mosquitoes as the vector of transmission. In this case, why people wouldn\u2019t be affected by eating the animals is that it doesn\u2019t generally occur in domestic animals and contact between humans and wild animals is relatively limited. Basically, Mosquitoes feeding on wild animals and then on humans increases the rate of contact required to transmit the virus.\n\nSomeone else had the right idea about the wrong type of microbe. There are parasites (malaria and others) that carry out part of their life cycle inside mosquitoes and require mosquitoes to transmit them, but that isn\u2019t the case here.",

Similarly, the holes in their defenses are not like ours so a pathogen that can get into a gap lizard cells won't find the chemical holes in mammal cells. \n\nAnd the more similar the animals, the closer on the evolutionary tree, the more likely that a disease will mutate in a way that lets it infect another species.  That's why humans keep getting diseases from other apes and monkeys (and why endangered primate populations need to be protected from human diseases).

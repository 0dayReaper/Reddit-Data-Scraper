            "comment": "Plants get oxygen through photosynthesis reactions and openings called stoma that allow CO2 and O2 to move between the plant and the environment. There is also some water loss called evapotranspiration, so sometimes plants only open their stoma at certain times (such as night when its cooler).\n\nPlants have various methods of obtaining oxygen through stoma, such as C4 and C3 grasses, where there is more or less efficiency at attracting oxygen/CO2 from the environment",

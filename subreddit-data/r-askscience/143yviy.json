Because then numerator will always = 0 so no acceleration.  \n\nAnd if not, then the ball would surely fall back to earth. And if that\u2019s true, wouldn\u2019t humans also float towards earth away from the ISS on a spacewalk?  \n\nAnd gravity is still present even at the ISS. Satellites use fuel to stay in orbit (yet the moon seemingly orbits earth in a way where gravity is not pulling it closer essentially in a perfect way which IMO proves godlike or spiritual influence on literal matter for it to be there over 1000s of years), so how is a human on a spacewalk not being dragged by their tether and instead it looks as if they move with it. Or is the force of the spaceship canceling out gravity what keeps the human moving at a constant rate seemingly locked in place?  \n  \nBlows my mind that the ISS is going 17k+ mph and the humans with it.",

Satellites use fuel to stay in orbit (yet the moon seemingly orbits earth in a way where gravity is not pulling it closer essentially in a perfect way which IMO proves godlike or spiritual influence on literal matter for it to be there over 1000s of years)\n\nWhile the Earth's gravity certainly affects the ISS and our satellites, the fact that ISS (and the satellites) are moving so fast means that they're in a constant state of free fall. They're being pulled towards the Earth by gravity, but they move so quickly perpendicular to the Earth's surface that they're essentially \"falling over the horizon\". Astronauts on board ISS experience weightlessness not because they're in a \"zero-gravity\" environment, but because they're in a constant free fall.\n\nBut ISS and satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) are not that far out in space. ISS orbits only 400 km above the surface and many satellites are at similar altitudes. At these altitudes, there is still some atmosphere left. It's extremely thin, but it's there and it has a measurable effect on satellites as the atmosphere creates a drag force that slows satellites down. If left uncorrected, this will cause satellites to gradually lose altitude and eventually crash or burn up in the denser atmosphere closer to the surface.\n\nThat's why these satellites have thrusters that they have to use. Every now and then, they need to burn some fuel to get a nudge and restore their orbit. But this need is solely due to the presence of trace amounts of air. If there was no air, an orbiting object wouldn't need these corrections. And that's why the Moon doesn't need thrusters as it's far enough away that there's no air left to slow it down. Just for a sense of perspective: At the furthest point in its orbit, the Moon is about a 1000x further from the Earth than ISS is.\n\nComing back to the space walks:\n\n&gt;  so how is a human on a spacewalk not being dragged by their tether and instead it looks as if they move with it. Or is the force of the spaceship canceling out gravity what keeps the human moving at a constant rate seemingly locked in place?\n\nThe astronaut on a space walk is in free fall just like the space station. That means that there's no (significant) net force pulling the astronaut in any specific direction if the astronaut is just floating there. The same air resistance that slows down the ISS and requires periodic boosting also affects the astronaut, but this effect is so small that it's irrelevant and unnoticeable in the time frame of a space walk.",

They aren't using fuel to counteract gravity, nor are they burning constantly -  they need to be periodically boosted every now and then to maintain their desired orbit.\n\nWithout reboosting, the satellite would gradually slow down, reducing the height of its orbit, until it re-enters Earth's atmosphere and burns up. This orbital decay is very slow because there's hardly any air at that height, it takes months - an astronaut who let go of the ISS will not immediately fall to Earth. \n\nBut the moon is *much* further away from Earth than the ISS - at that height there really is no air at all - so its orbit does not decay. In fact, the Moon is slowly moving *further away from Earth* due to tidal interaction - the energy of the Earth's rotation is slowly being transferred to the Moon.",

            "comment": "Gallileo showed a few centuries ago that all objects fall at the same rate under gravity, so in your example the reason the astronaut wouldn't be pulled away from the space station by Earth's gravity is they are *both* being pulled at the same rate by Earth's gravity so they stay together.\n\nSatellites are mostly significantly closer than the moon and so have more interactions with the atmosphere. The air doesn't just stop suddenly, it gets thinner and thinner and there's faint whisps really far out. Plus the gravity of the Earth is uneven and the satellite experiences like a very slightly bumpy road. They need fuel to correct for these.\n\nBut you are kind of right. The moon might be massive and able to largely negate a whisp of air, but the whisp counts and it's been millions of years. Even if it hasn't collided with us or whatever, *something* must be happening.\n\nThe moon *is* getting energy.\n\nIn fact the Moon's orbit is getting larger because of it.\n\nThe Moon goes around us one per month, and we rotate under it once a day. As the Moon pulls on the seas to form tides the seas pull on the Moon because gravity pulls both ways. If the high tide just sat under the Moon then that would make no real difference, but the land masses of the rotating Earth pushes the water away which gives a tiny tug on the Moon making it speed up and because the energy budget has to be balanced, it's also slightly slowing down our rotation.\n\nGiven an unlimited amount of time, the Moon would speed up and the Earth would slow down until they were tidally locked. In the same way the Moon only shows us one side, we'd end up showing the Moon one side of the Earth (and days would be super long). \n\nAlas that would be on the timescales where how the Sun evolves over it's lifetime becomes a significant question and it's likely the Earth will be burnt up long before the Earth tidally locks to the Moon.",

There is no need to fine-tune anything, staying in orbit is the only option for the Moon.\n\nHumans next to the ISS are in the same orbit as the ISS (to an extremely good approximation) so they can just float next to it, both are in a free fall. The very thin atmosphere at the altitude of the ISS means that the orbital altitude decreases slowly over months, that's why they need a bit of fuel to raise the orbit once in a while, but that's negligible within the time an astronaut needs to move around.",

            "comment": "&gt;which IMO proves godlike or spiritual influence on literal matter for it to be there over 1000s of years\n\nIt's kind of amazing how much this sentiment reflects a joking one Feynman once made in one of his lectures, where he said people used to believe little angels were pushing the planets along in their orbits.\n\nHere's a good, heuristic way to understand the orbit of something like the moon. Shoot a cannon into the air 45 degrees, and it will travel some distance along the surface of the globe before it falls to the ground. Shoot another one into the air, only this time a little bit faster, and it will go even further along the globe. Shoot one fast enough, though, and it will circle the whole globe and continue to do so indefinitely (ignoring drag forces). Gravity is always pulling the cannonball towards the center of the globe, but, if you were to manage to fire it fast enough, it would never actually hit the ground and it would continue along in an orbit: That's why something like the moon stays in orbit around the Earth and never falls into it.\n\nThe human on the ISS undertaking a spacewalk is moving with the ISS-- they have the same velocity as it does-- so they are moving fast enough to stay in orbit with it. Gravity is still present and pulling them towards the surface of the earth, but they're moving fast enough that they never fall back into it: The combination of the velocity they're moving and the pull of the earth's gravity, in fact, keeps them and the ISS from flying off into space. The ISS, unlike the moon, moreover, has to use fuel to stay in orbit, not because there's a miracle that keeps the moon from falling to the earth, but because the ISS is closer to the earth's atmosphere and experiences drag from that, which would otherwise slow it down over time.",

            "comment": "To add to the other answers regarding orbital decay. The ISS travels around 7600 metres per second (17,000 miles per hour). A typical orbit boost manoeuvre accelerates the space station by less than 10 metres per second (22 mph) and takes several minutes to do so, and a boost like that is done about once a month. It's a very slight boost to compensate for a very slight amount of air drag.\n\nIt ends up needing about 4 tonnes of propellant a year, which sounds like a lot but considering the ISS masses over 4 *hundred* tonnes, it's a bit like if half a tank of gas was enough to last your car the entire year.",

    "postText": "Hi, as a popsci reader, I don't really have any insight on current research in psychology, so I would love some input. I read Kahnemanns 'Thinking, fast and slow' maybe 10 years ago and just finished a book about Acceptance &amp; Commitment therapy and to me it seems like the ideas in each synergize very well. \n\nE.g. ACT talks about 'fusion' of cognitive processes with behavior - a system 1 acting automatically - and proposes 'observing' your cognitive processes and 'defusing' these with behavior - a more deliberate and conscious system 2. Has there been any research into this? It seems like it could help therapy if the ways to assist system 2 are employed?\n\nI'm not sure of the scientific standing of either of these models, especially in the face of the replication crisis but any input is appreciated. Thanks!",

            "comment": "Kind of yeah.\nThe concept of automatic thoughts is prevalent through a lot of CBTs. \nCognitive Processing Therapy calls them [\"stuck points\"](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/treatments/cognitive-processing-therapy); cognitive therapy calls them [\"automatic thoughts\"](https://dictionary.apa.org/automatic-thoughts); some therapies refer to them as [\"cognitive distortions\"](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-to-recognize-and-tame-your-cognitive-distortions-202205042738).  The idea is that our brains get stuck in habitual ways of responding/thinking, which is typically a helpful System 1 (fast) approach that has been applied too broadly or generally and what helps is activating System 2 in response to that thought. You see techniques like [mindfulness](https://www.apa.org/topics/mindfulness), challenging beliefs, etc. commonly throughout CBTs as a way to force System 2 on to help to become effective in the face of those.",

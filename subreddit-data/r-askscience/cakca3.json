            "comment": "Former zookeeper here: I\u2019ve only personally worked with lesser apes, but from my observations they either squat to use their urine to scent mark, or just pee from their perch. No hands involved. Ring tailed lemurs (not an ape, but a tangentially related fun fact) will pee on their tails, then flick the scent at each other. \n\nThe rest of the great apes have much much smaller penis to body size ratios than humans do. Gorillas are only about the size of your pinky. Also unlike humans, most apes have a penis bone, which means their flaccid penis is much less \u201cfloppy.\u201d So humans have a much different penis anatomy than other apes, which could lead to the behavioral difference of holding it while you pee.",

Animals are often like us in that they try to avoid defecating in places they eat and sleep (really depending on the animal) so you might not see them doing this in their main living area.",

I would notice a little pile and vacuum it up, only for it to reappear again and again. One day I sat and watched. Sure enough one after another these dead ants would get pushed out of the hole in the ceiling and make a little pile on the pillow.",

It wasn\u2019t clear if these were actual latrines or if these areas just coincided with preferred sleeping spots. We noted every time one of these spots were utilized and it was pretty rare that they were used outside of sleeping times. They did forage in these areas during the day and they did not exclusively use the \u201clatrine\u201d areas to go to the bathroom. \n\nThe only primates that have had latrine behaviour documented are lemurs. Remember that lemurs are actually fairly separated on the evolutionary chain from New World and Old World primates and tend to have more primitive characteristics. Thus, this behaviour may be a primitive hold out. \n\nSource: https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/85/3/420/900401",

We started like every other primate, genitals tucked under and intercourse from behind; missionary position isn't something you see a lot outside humans.\n\nWhen some mutation made us start to stand more erect, we were not designed for it (hips, pelvis, etc.); but it was so advantageous it overcame the negative points that came with it. Being able to sprint is such a big evolutionary deal we can deal with childbirth and intercourse not working the way it had for millions of years. Some stuff is cramped, some stuff is out of place, but whatever.\n\nDon't think 'someone screwed up their design'; think 'when something better came along, the other parts of us had to deal with it best they could'.",

Natural climate change later dried it up but back then it looked very different.\n\nThe great ape of the plains is probably a myth. The great ape of the swampy forests more like.",

AFAIK the great plains in southeastern Africa were real and very much a forest that used to be very dense but through climate change turned into more of a savannah than a forest and forced the apes to either walk or stay in the trees and likely die out. In the northwest, apparently there was more of a tropical environment with swamps and rivers that also gave an advantage to bipedal apes because of better movement and hunting in water. According to the museum, one theory doesn't make the other one impossible so I think both are still just as valid as before.",

It could be like peacock feathers, where it's a sexual feature that might attract mates, the shape and size showing some sort of healthiness of a male.\n\nIt might be disadvantageous fighting wise, but also a male that can protect their penis and prevent it from getting maimed or disfigured might be a signal they are a worthy, healthy mate... in prehistoric times, maybe a male with a somewhat large and healthy un-maimed penis was a pretty big indicator that they haven't lost serious fights, could protect themselves, are strong and healthy genetically and physically, etc. If one of the most vulnerable parts of a person's body is healthy, then that's a sign they can protect themselves.",

There's no relation between size and virility, so it's almost certainly due to some aspect of human social behavior in mate selection rather than utility. Beyond that, there are no widely recognized theories as to why it's larger. Making conjectures as to why is fun and all, but the fact is that we don't know why.

If we are outside we do it out of habit more than anything and it\u2019s socially learned. No human baby pulls out it\u2019s penis and \u201caims\u201d it. It\u2019s learned when we potty train the child, and often a last step as we have them sit first.",

            "comment": "Human male penis size relative to body size is VASTLY greater than other apes (and almost every other mammal). This is likely due to a number of reasons, although it\u2019s important to understand that physical evolutionary traits are not being governed by some conscious force trying to get optimal results, so it could just be a random genetic mutational accident that we have since compensated for (as long as it doesn\u2019t seriously inhibit reproduction then a trot won\u2019t be selected against).\n\nFirst, is that we have a very low degree of sexual dimorphism compared to other apes (and many mammals in general). A male gorilla with a penis the same proportions as their body compared to humans would potentially cause a lot of pain from ripping and tearing the relatively much smaller female gorillas, for example (especially considering they don\u2019t generally give the female any time to \u201cwarm up\u201d and get the natural lubricant flowing).\n\nSecond, female sexual pleasure is an important part of human mating, and encourages more frequent reproduction opportunities compared to animals that don\u2019t have this trait. Other traits that contribute to this effect in humans are frequent menstrual cycles concealed estrus. Instead of a yearly period of \u201cheat,\u201d human females are available for insemination at regular, frequent intervals. It\u2019s apparent in other species when the female is fertile, but human females do not exhibit engorged and discolored labia, nor do they exhibit strong pheromones during their period of receptivity to being impregnated. All of this contributes to increased mating opportunities. It also contributes to a confusion about paternal parentage, which seriously reduces the amount of babies killed by dominant males that only want females to spend their time and energy caring for their children (since any of the kids given birth to by a female they have mated with could be theirs), which would otherwise be common, and is still frequently seen when males from outside a group take over that group (they can safely kill all the kids because they definitely aren\u2019t theirs). But that\u2019s not relevant to the current discussion; I just wanted to point out how these things aren\u2019t only related to the same root causes as increased penis size, and how they may not really be related to penis size at all. Some of these factors are also present in other primates, not just us.\n\nThird is the phenomenon of a sperm arms race, due to the aforementioned incentive for frequent copulation of females with multiple males in the same general time period. When multiple males inseminate a female around the same time, the one that gets their sperm the furthest in has a better chance. Ejaculation velocity and sperm \u201cswimming\u201d speed are also important, but sperm can be relatively slow to get going through the first parts of the vagina, so those things being equal, a longer penis equals enhanced reproductive capabilities. Gorillas, for example, typically only have one male attempting copulation within their harem at any one time, so there is no need for sperm competition.\n\nIf you look outside apes to other primates, there are a bunch of monkeys that have similar penis ratios, likely for similar reasons, so we\u2019re not exclusive with this particular trait. We do have very small testicles relative to our body weight, compared with other apes, but I haven\u2019t studied the reasons for this as much so I\u2019ll just leave it at that, except to say that chimpanzees probably have even more sperm competition than humans ever did, but they don\u2019t have larger penises, and that\u2019s probably because their testes are over 33% the size of their brains, while ours are a paltry 3%. This is because their solution to this sperm competition is to use their massive testicles to copulate with females many times a day, every day, whereas if humans attempt this, their sperm count drops drastically after only two ejaculations a day.\n\nThere are a variety of other factors to consider, such as our tendency towards monogamy and how it clashes with some of these other theories. We could have moved closer to monogamy relatively recently, but conflicting with that is the fact that Humans have remarkably smooth penises, which is generally found in monogamous species. Polygynous species usually have odd proportions such as huge heads that act as a plug, or bumps and ridges and extreme curvatures, etc. Human males also are quite a bit bigger than females, just not as much as some other species.\n\nEdit: I meant to respond to the other comment about this, not the main post.",

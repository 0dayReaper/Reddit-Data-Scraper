I don't see where entropy is involved in this case ?",

            "comment": "Entropy and Enthalpy are connected in your example. As was mentioned there is heat loss, etc.\n\nThe issue you raise is more intuitively understood in simple systems. Think of a system of three billiard balls bouncing around a table. For a short clip, it's not obvious if the video is being played forward or backward. The balls collide and rebound based on simple forces and there is no arrow of time in evidence except in their slowing down due to friction. \n\nScale this up to a larger system where the atoms behave classically like the billard balls and you have the basic conundrum. Even dissipative forces are classically just forces on the balls and have no inherent \"direction\" at the simplest level. In the aggregate, however, Entropy enters the picture and the system tends toward disorder. \n\nIn classical physics this is a manifestation of large probabilities, and not a fundamental force or \"arrow of time\" that drives the system. Hence, at a fundamental level, the system is theoretically reversible and time's arrow is just a probabilistic manifestation of large numbers. In theory, pockets of the universe could, at times, run against the arrow by sheer \"luck,\" though the numbers involved make this unlikely at any macro scale.\n\nThat's more or less what is being talked about regarding classical physics and the lack of a universal time direction or discrimination.",

An isolated system is defined as one that exchanges neither mass nor energy with its surroundings. When water freezes to form a snowflake, that process involves heat being transferred to the surroundings, so it is not an isolated system. If you take the water and the surroundings, however, the entropy of the combination does increase, because the entropy lost in the freezing process is less than the entropy gained by the surroundings due to heat transfer over a finite temperature difference.",

This whole topic is about entropy and disorder, and this is a great example, because entropy is just probability at it's core. So you can shuffle a brand new deck and have x amount of possible ways the cards are now in order. Only 1 way will return them closer to their original state. Then do it, I think, 7 more times. The probability of all 8 of those shuffles being the exact ones you need to bring back order is many times smaller than the probability of there being disorder within the deck of cards. \n\nThis is also why people are saying entropy **tends** toward disorder, because it doesn't necessarily have to. There is an infinitesimally small probability that everything in the universe will become more orderly and come back to being in a single place, rather than disorderly spread across the cosmos. The chance is just so small that it's basically negligible. This leads to the belief that any system will **always** being more disorderly.",

It's also a known theory that the universe recycles itself but collapsing back to an infinitesimally small point and reigniting the big bang. \n \nThe thing is, we don't really know what's going to happen in many billions or trillions of years. Heat death of the universe is another theory, but mostly thought to be without collapsing back in. Just sitting there forever with nothing but iron.  our knowledge of cosmic inflation and the (most likely) increasingly expanding universe, we can't be certain.\n\nEven another theory is that inflation becomes so great that space itself is ripped apart well before the heat death would come. In that case, the probability of such an event you speak of happening would probably be almost nothing.\n\nTl;dr: Possibly, but we just don't know honestly.",

The cards, moving forward in time, are slowly breaking down into particulate. If you left the cards on a table for a million years the cards and table would be gone when you came back. To \"reverse the shuffle\" you would have to also reverse this effect of time, which we can't do. Just shuffling the cards themselves, even perfectly in reverse, doesn't reverse what happened to them. They're still affected by the events that occurred. Because we can't turn back time.\n\nBut if we could, if that was part of shuffling in reverse, then their entropy - assuming a closed system, for this one instance - should also reverse. The particles shaved off the cards from the friction would come back, the cards would return to their original state.",

You jump off, never to return, and appear in a part of space that we imagine is so empty that the nearest particle to your ship is getting pulled away from you at lightspeed by universal expansion.\n\nNow we ask the question - Are you moving? Perhaps your FTL unit deposits you with some nonzero momentum, but... Compared to what? How can you be sure? There's literally no frame of reference - You cannot be moving, because motion is relative and there is nothing to move relative to. In a sense, there is no space for you - There is no way to measurably change your position.\n\nOn the other hand, you could argue that you left with your nose pointing away from Earth, and you haven't turned, and your FTL carries you in a straight line - So you have a point of reference, it's just impossible for you to see it or interact with it because you're permanently causally disconnected from it. You'd imagine, then, that if you fire your engine forwards, you're moving away from Earth with some velocity. Perhaps space does exist, and you can't measure it? If you drop a rock out the window, so it and you are the only two things in your observable universe, does space exist again?\n\nIt's kind of a philosophical question, in a way, because obviously the space-time continuum is still there, you just have no way to measure movement through it.\n\nIt's the same with heat death. If the universe is perfectly homogenous, then there is no real change that can occur - if you step forward in time a little, or backward in time a little, things look exactly the same.\n\nSo, is time still there? Is time moving? Is time only moving because you know far enough in one direction there was still some heterogeneity left?\n\nSurely the time dimension will still exist, but we've lost any good way to describe it - If you took a thousand pictures of a heat-dead universe and asked some intelligence to sort them in time order, itd be physically impossible to do so, because they're all identical - Even if pictures were taken thousands of years apart.\n\nScience likes to operate with things that are measurable. Heat death makes time unmeasurable, at least outside a thought experiment where everything is heat-dead but you with your battery and your clock.",

The relationship between statistical and classical thermodynamics allows us to find a relationship between the \"order\" of a system in terms of microstates and the thermodynamic property of entropy. The Second Law of Thermodynamics tells us that, at a universe wide level, entropy can never decrease.\n\nOne of the reasons thermodynamics is difficult is because words have very specific meanings that are not necessarily aligned with how the same words are used in \"everyday\" conversational speech.",

The example can be extended past individual particles, the laws of physics allows *everything* to be reversed. The math describing everything only has a notion of sequentiality / causality but not any notion of direction.\n\nIf you record a collection of particles in a vacuum which starts in order and then scatter randomly, this recording is indistinguishable physically speaking from if you started with random order and waited *eons* until a structure spontaneously appeared and then selected the interesting bits of the recording to display in backwards order. Mathematically speaking, going back in time just means flipping one sign. But we don't know if one sign or the other means \"forwards\" and we can't even tell which sign something has by looking at it, we can just tell when the sign flips, so we just have to pick one and go from there.",

The attendance sheet doesn't much care where people sit, so long as the right people show up. So unassigned seating has higher entropy (or disorder, if you must) than assigned seating.\n\nThe thing to keep in mind about your example is that the star at the center of a solar system is releasing energy from the system at a much higher rate than in a diffuse cloud of gas. That allows the local decrease in the number of equivalent microstates.",

The end game requires that you roll the exact right number to get your piece past the finish line. So while it's equiprobable that you get any possible roll of the dice, you end up in situations where certain outcomes require specific rolls.\n\nThis happens in more than just games. The oxygen III forbidden emission lines are called \"semi-forbidden\", because the excitation state necessary to release the photon is too rare to be observable on earth. That is, the particular arrangements of oxygen atoms that would lead to the emission of [OIII] is entropically very low relative to the purest vacuum ever achieved on earth. Do we know what those configurations could be? Of course not. There are too many atoms, so those configurations are practically unknowable (I use \"practically\" in the narrow technical sense. There is no *practical* way to know even one configuration of atoms in an [OIII] emissions region of a nebula). But in the context of [OIII] emission, we call those configurations that lead to [OIII] emission \"highly ordered\", because there are fewer of those configurations compared to the number of configurations that don't lead to [OIII] emissions. [OIII] emission is observable in e.g. planetary nebula, but since it cannot be duplicated in a lab, initially astronomers thought it indicative of a new element \"Nebulium\".\n\n\nThat is, incidentally, why I hate the \"order/disorder\" explanation of entropy. Most human definitions of order are not tied together in any meaningful sense (see my assigned-seating analogy). The entropy of a cash drawer containing a defined amount of money is calculable, but then somebody says \"well, money isn't real, so your 'order' is just arbitrary\". But a given macrostate (emission of [OIII], for instance) has a finite number of equivalent microstates, and that finite number is less than the number of equivalent microstates that compose the no-[OIII]-emission macrostate.",

Rewind the clock far back enough and you have the theoretical moment where all of spacetime was compressed down to a single point - the most ordered anything could possibly be.\n\nNow what came before that? Hard to say. It might be a nonsensical question, like asking what's north of the north pole.  Plenty of theories out there of what a \"before\" might be, or what a multiverse might look like.

Conformal cyclic cosmology posits that there's an eternal cycle of universes coming into being, expanding, then decaying into massless particles. Since particle interactions are necessary for time to exist, you can compress infinite time into a single moment, and get a very unlikely Big Bang to happen again in all the nothingness. Put another way, complete nothingness and complete somethingness (all of existence in a single point at the Big Bang) are indistinguishable.\n\nIn any event that's one valid theory out of many.  Again, it could very well be a nonsensical question to ask what came before the Big Bang. Or it could not. We don't have enough evidence to confidently arrive at either conclusion.

It just was, that's the best explanation we have right now.\n\nWe follow the chain of orderliness backwards through time and we see orderliness increasing as the universe tends towards a much smaller and more compact state (which means everything has to be arranged in more and more specific ways in order to fit it all in the smaller space) and finally we arrive at the big bang which held the entire universe in a mindbogglingly, completely un-understandably compact space and that's as far as we get. Why was it so ordered? Dunno...\n\nBut since it was so ordered, entropy was given a long lifespan to work the order towards disorder, and during that process useful work can emerge, because some areas are more orderly than others (stars are more orderly than empty space), and the flow of energy from one place to another can power things. That is why life exists. So we required that orderly start with a disorderly finish (at least, we expect it to be disorderly) in order for us to even exist to observe it.\n\nIt's all kinda weird and thought-provoking and \"mystical\" in some sense. We are the universe examining itself, asking why does order move towards disorder, and yet the universe requires that movement of order to disorder for us to even exist to question why it is happening in the first place...",

Thus there are the same number of states of either kind. \n\nThe probability explanation is not really right, because (ad you said) it could be used  to argue that it would be most probable, entropy was higher in the past. \n\nThe crucial thing which has to be added here is the explicit postulate, that the entropy of the world was very low at a point in the past, in reality set at the big bang. This is called the \"past hypothesis\". Without it (or another time-reversal-symmetry breaking assumption) it is impossible to derive a time-asymmetric law from exclusively time-symmetrical ones.",

But the process of creating a crystal releases energy.  This energy diffuses into the surroundings.  This diffusion of energy increases the entropy of the surroundings by more than the entropy of the crystal decreases.  Thus, even if the crystal becomes more \"orderly\" and has a low entropy, the universe has gained entropy as a result of the crystal forming.\n\nSimilarly, every single chemical reaction that happens in your body increases the entropy of the universe.",

Entropy, and Enthalpy. \n\nEntropy: Disorder in a system\n\nEnthalpy: Energy in a system\n\nThe \"perfect\" state is that of low energy and high disorder. The universe is ALWAYS trying to achieve this goal, but achieving these properties is inversely related. (I will talk from a chemistry perspective, I am a chemical engineer by education, so it's easier for me to explain)\n\nThere is always a tradeoff or compromise to be made for a change of state, or a reaction to occur. As I stated, the quest for high entropy and low enthalpy are inversely related, meaning as disorder increases, the energy of the system increases as well. \n\nSomething that has entered a crystal lattice structure has taken a state that is highly ordered (very low entropy) but is very low enthalpy (energy) (solids are lower energy than liquids, which are lower energy than gasses). While something being melted, has taken a higher energy state, with higher entropy.

Its not literally impossible for a system to become more ordered, just very very *very* unlikely.  The barrier preventing a system from becoming lower entropy is probability.\n\nTo help you visualize: putting a deck of 52 cards in order is the lowest entropy state, and there is only a few well ordered ways to arrange the deck (grouping suits together while arranging them by point value).  There are 8x10\\^67 ways to organize a deck of cards.  As you shuffle an ordered deck of cards you would expect the cards to become more randomly distributed.  This is because while there are a few arrangements of cards that are well ordered, the vast, vast, *vast* majority aren't.  You could spend the entire lifetime of the universe doing nothing but shuffling, a hundred, a thousand, *billions* of lifetimes of the universe just shuffling, and have almost no chance of recreating that original ordered state.  There isn't some force preventing you from reaching that state, its just that its one ordered state in an unfathomable sea of randomness.  The same is true for all systems.  There are always going to be many many more ways for things to be in a random mess rather than in an ordered structure, and that is why systems have a tendency towards disorder.",

There is only exactly one way for the balls to be perfectly racked at the end of the table as they would be before a game. Once you break them, chaotically rearranging them into some new state, they will wind up in one of many many states that we consider \"disordered\".\n\nImportantly, if you took a snapshot of the balls as they were immediately after breaking, there is *also* only exactly one way for them to be arranged like that. The difference is that arrangement is considered more or less equivalent to all the other \"broken\" arrangements, whereas no other arrangement is considered equivalent to the \"racked\" arrangement (ignoring rotations and such).\n\nRandomly scattering the balls into *exactly* that arrangement again has about the same probability as putting them right back into a racked state, but we don't care if they break into exactly in that same state. It is a high entropy state, and there are many more that are just like it for all intents and purposes, even though technically every possibility is a totally unique state with an equally minuscule probability of happening.",

If you have an infinite volume space and place it next to an infinite volume space, they will both infinite expand and contract at once well not really, how about I assume whoever reads this gets the concept of infinity in that it doesn't count, it just is. As you walk closer, it stays the same distance. So if you have an infinite volume, you can't really move it anywhere because its already there. The second implication of an infinite volume is that every point is the center point. If you have the two volumes next to each other the farthest points apart will always be the center points. So any movement in any direction will move you away from the center point and make you move away/towards the other infinite volume slower than remaining stationary in the center, while still remaining the center point, so you don't really move anywhere. So we have the infinite volumes and they are moving away from each other but as the volume expands within its own volume, each of the center points begin also falling away/towards the other center points. So from each points perspective it is the center of the universe and therefore effectively becomes its own thing within a thing like a bubble inside the infinity. The bubble would allow while not violating the movement issue because nothing moves in the infinite volume but the volume is infinite and can be stretched or bent in anyway, no matter how far you pull at the string, it will keep going.\n\nSo why would infinite volumes cause chaos vs order? Because it would mean every point is falling away/towards all of the other points but if they all exist within the bubble then their movements naturally want to go away from all other points while they and everything else expands. Like everything's inside a balloon and we only see the outline of anything pushing against the side and the balloon and everything in it expands while expanding at the same rate. Without variation in speed there would be just a balloon shell. With variations in speed you get the edges being pressed against unevenly which is caused by time dilation which functions very intuitively within the infinite volume model as the faster you go, you get farther from the center and thus lower the speed at which you move in relation to the other infinite volume.\n\nLike I said, thats my crackpot model.",

For any pair of two balls, if we delete all the other balls, their interaction is obviously time reversible.  If we do this with many balls clumped together and moving at high speed, the ones on the outside will soon fly away from the pack, and the ones in the middle will rapidly bounce around until they have more room after many of the outer balls have shot away.\n\nThis doesn't initially seem time reversible, since if you shoot a bunch of balls toward the same point at a high rate of speed, you wouldn't expect them to all bounce around perfectly until they arrange themselves in a dense lattice.  But it is time reversible.  If you let this experiment run for some amount of time, and then pause the clock, reverse all velocities, and let it play again, what happens?  Sure enough, all the balls bounce perfectly into that lattice we specificed as an initial configuration.\n\nBut real life doesn't work like this, because such a perfect collision requires all of the billiard balls to have exactly the right initial velocities and come in at exactly the right angle at exactly the right time.  Why should such a coincidence happen?  \n\nHmm, makes me wonder if there is some kind of principle that over time, there is a high likelihood of a system moving from a state of order to a state of disorder.

Here, it is obvious that this is the case, which is why I specified a \"short\" clip where it is not obvious that the balls are slowing down. The analogy, and any analogy, will break down when you dive into enough detail. Here it's important not to \"mistake the map for the territory.\" The example is given as a way of helping the reader to understand the broader physical problem. \n\nIn the second case, we can take your point a step further. Here we ask why the frictional force provides a directional component to the the system? The answer is that it does not *a priori*. It is only with the additional knowledge that the frictional force is dissipative that we are able to make this inference. \n\nIn fact, considering the larger context of the problem, there is no fundamental physical law in classical mechanics dictating that the frictional force need be dissipative. It is POSSIBLE that the random thermal interactions of the atoms on the table surface happen to align to impart *more* energy to the balls, speeding them up. Thus, the only directional time component arrives in the aggregate as a large number of particles interact. \n\nAgain, using the pool table analogy as written but simply specifying a frictionless table, we arrive at the same point and then scale the number of these \"pool balls\" up my many orders of magnitude to achieve the atoms of the table itself: it is only in the statistical aggregate that they slow down the macro pool balls. That is, it is only because it is orders of magnitude more probable that, at any given moment, the interaction of the macro pool balls with the atomic \"pool balls\" of the table is dissipative (that is, on average, aligned in any direction *other* than in the direction of the macro ball's motion) that the resulting interaction slows rather than speeds the macro pool balls. \n\nSo, the apparent emergence of a time vector is simply a manifestation of statistical probability spread across a massive number of force vectors and not the result of any physical law. It is entirely possible and physically reasonable to run the whole system backward by instantaneously reversing the momentum of every particle. There is therefore no fundamental preference for a \"forward\" flow of time in Classical Physics, it's simply the result of laws of large numbers which tend to drive systems as a whole toward the most probabilistic states (that is, those collections of states with the highest number of possible configurations). \n\nTo pile analogy upon analogy: The are approximately 43,000,000,000,000,000,000 ways to configure the tiles in a Rubik's cube. There is one 1 \"correct\" way. By randomly spinning the cube's axes, you will effectively always end up in a \"disordered\" state. If you begin in a state very near the ordered state, random chance will drive you further from this state and toward increasing \"disorder\" with fewer tiles in the correct location, simply because the number of these states is so much higher. \n\nThe appearance of a directional arrow of time in classical physics is just a manifestation of this same phenomenon, even when accounting for dissipative forces like friction.",

The term order is really in reference to a statistical probability of possible states.\n\nTo help with the example of a billiard ball, the ball slows down because of friction. What this really means is that on a molecular level, the momentum of the ball is transferred to molecules of air  and we call that \"heat\" since the average velocity of these molecules has increased.\n\nNow, is it possible to run this backwards and have all the faster molecules of air strike the ball at the right angle to transfer the momentum back? Yes but this is very unlikely. \n\nGiven a certain amount of energy in the \"system\" of air and ball, most of the time the energy from the air will not be transferred to the ball and maybe once in a few trillion years the molecules will align to strike in such a way that the room temperature lowers and the ball speeds up.\n\nSo 99.99999999999...% of the time things can happen one way and almost never happen the other. This is your time arrow. The reason that one \"direction\" is more likely is that the ball transferring energy into air molecules can  happen in a gazillion different ways with the same result (air gets \"warmer\" and the ball slows down). There are very few ways for the air molecules to align to transfer the energy the other way so you say that, in general, it does not happen. This is entropy.",

            "comment": "My understanding is that Newtonian physics is time-reversible in the sense that if you inverted the momentum vector for every object/particle, nothing would prohibit the system from returning to its original state.  This is true even in spite of the second law of thermodynamics, which is a statistical law that holds only on average; it is possible to find (statistically very rare) counterexamples in which entropy spontaneously decreases.\n\nHowever, these rare exceptions are ultimately far too rare for them to be borne out, on average, in macroscopic systems with huge numbers of microstates (e.g. particle positions and momenta in, say, a gas) which evolve randomly.  It is statistically overwhelmingly more likely that entropy will increase rather than decrease.  This *statistical* difference in likelihood between increasing- and decreasing-entropy outcomes for randomly-behaving systems is ultimately what drives the thermodynamic arrow of time:  since systems are so much more likely to evolve into higher-entropy states than lower ones, that is what they reliably end up doing in the grand scheme of things.\n\nSo there is a sense in which the thermodynamic arrow of time is \"incidental\" in that it is not a hard and fast physical law that must always be obeyed \u2014 nothing enforces the higher-entropy outcome \u2014 but rather is a statistical law where exceptions exist but are rare.  Consequently, if you analyze any typical system which started in a low-entropy state and evolved to a high-entropy state (i.e. virtually all natural thermodynamic systems that were not carefully prepared), and were to reverse its' kinematic time-evolution, you would expect to see it go from a high-entropy state to a low-entropy state without violating any laws of physics, in fact just purely following the exact same laws that governed the system's forwards time-evolution.\n\nThat is why it is counter-intuitive \u2014 nothing in the laws of physics prevents systems from decreasing in entropy if the conditions are right, and by simply flipping the momentum direction in any system would give a clear prescription for doing so for any arbitrary system.  But in practice it never really works out that way statistically because it's exceedingly unlikely for a randomly-behaving system to find itself in such a configuration.\n\nHope that helps!",

Funnily, it turns out, that for any level of entropy, there is exactly the same amount of states tending to lower entropy than states tending to higher entropy. This can be seen in the following argument: \n\nConsider a (micro)state of the system, that tends from lower to higher entropy. Because of the time reversal symmetry, the state will evolve backwards, if you flip the momentum of every particle. Thus there is a one to one correspondence between states from both sets.\n\nThe argument is often given, that, because of the higher number of states with high entropy, it is very likely, that the system will be in higher entropy at any point in the future. But for a system where you only know the current macrostate and nothing else, it could in the same way be argued, that the system probably was at higher entropy at any point in the past. (Because there is no fundamental asymmetry between past and future.)\n\nThe assumption that has to be added is, that there was a point of low entropy in the past. (The big bang for example.) This just has to be postulated and is usually called the past hypothesis. Without an assumption that breaks time symmetry, you just can't derive a time-asymmetric law from exclusively time-symmetrical ones.",

            "comment": "&gt;To me a simple oscillatory system with damping is not time-reversible, since you would notice it immediately if it was played backwards.\n\nThis is a bit of a deceptive example because the damping is a forcing function, and you had to know something *a priori* about the forcing function before you could look at its action on the system and conclude which direction time flows.  More to the point, it's not about whether you'd \"notice it\".  It's about whether you could trace the system's behavior back along a unique path to a unique starting point.  With a damped oscillator, you can do this.\n\nNewtonian physics isn't a full and complete description of reality.  It makes a great deal of simplifying assumptions, which are most famously clear when comparing to quantum mechanics, but in principle are always present.  In this case one of the simplifying assumptions *is precisely* that we can always trace every single interaction backwards or forward through time.  Or more precisely, that we have access to the measuring technology that allows us to do this.\n\nEntropy is a thermodynamic concept, and is statistical in nature.  By way of that, it doesn't care what individual particles do, only how an *ensemble* of particles can be described.  One simple way to think of entropy is as a measure of the *degeneracy* of the system you're looking at.  The meaning of degeneracy here comes from math and is similar to redundancy.  Different configurations of particles in an ensemble (that is, different combinations of position and velocity for each particle in the set) are *degenerate* if each of those configurations leads to the ensemble having the same total energy (or really the same value of any other state variable).\n\nEntropy is linked to temperature in that the higher the temperature, the more available configurations there are (because the number of possible speeds for particles to have is greater).  Higher temperature -&gt; higher entropy -&gt; more degenerate configurations.  Conversely, lower temperature -&gt; lower entropy -&gt; fewer degenerate configurations.\n\nIn reality, we don't and cannot trace the paths of individual particles, at least not outside of the lab.  Instead, we trace the paths of ensembles, and thus degeneracy is key.  Degeneracy messes up your ability to trace a unique path of interactions backward in time to recover a unique initial state.  Under Newtonian assumptions, you can always do this perfectly, but under Newtonian assumptions, we have measuring devices so goddamned amazing that we don't have to resort to tracking ensembles.\n\nI have made it sound like entropy is purely a consequence of using statistical shortcuts to model bulk materials.  I leave it for another day to discuss whether that's actually the case and what either answer to that question imply.  :)",

And then the arrow starts to make sense.\n\nIn one time direction, the energy starts localized as potential energy and is dissipated into the environment and the damping system.\n\nIn the opposite time direction, randomly dissipated energy needs to coalesce all moving in the same direction, smoothly interfering in exactly the right way to put the energy back into your oscillator.\n\nNewtonian physical calculations are only time symmetric in the ideal case. If you actually did have to account for the wind resistance on your cow-shaped cow, your calculations become much more complicated.\n\nBut if you can account for all the losses to friction and other things, then you will find you have the same amount of energy at the end of the measurement as you had when you started.\n\nConservation of energy arises from the time symmetry of the universe. \n\nThere are just more ways for any given system to lose energy to the universe than there are for any given system to spontaneously gain energy from the universe.

Nothing about the physics is incorrect, and nothing about the colors is physically impossible, but nevertheless this requires cheating; we let the blocks fall, color them once they've landed, and then propagate the colors back in time. This is possible on a computer. But if it did happen in real life, you would only be able to say \"this is an incredible coincidence\" and not \"this is physically impossible\".\n\nThe same is true of an oscillatory system with damping played backward. You would see the oscillations increasing, not unphysically, but because the atoms in the material and in the air just happened to be moving in the right way to increase the amplitude of the system instead of decrease it. You would only be able to say \"This is an incredible coincidence; it should never happen in the entire lifetime of the universe that the macrostate I observed (a seemingly-dampened system) would correspond to one of the microstates which time-evolves into a higher amplitude!\"",

The 'rules' of thermodynamics which disallow time-reversal are derived through a whole string of statistical mathematics that includes dropping statistically insignificant terms and quantities.

It would start with the concentration of molecular motion (heat) within the damping mechanism which would organize into motion of the components and cause the device to begin oscillating. While this is allowable in Newtonian physics, it is so unlikely as to be functionally impossible.

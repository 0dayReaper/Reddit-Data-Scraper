    "postText": "When a body part is compressed for a short period of time, why are only sensory neurons affected (paresthesia/anesthesia) by compression but not motor neurons (paralysis)? Like, the body part gets numb/tingly, but voluntary movement continues to function. Why is this the case?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nYes, I am aware that mild paralysis occurs with compression, but this tends to occur later. Also, by \"compression\", I meant like when your arm, thigh, etc., is squished, not like carpal-tunnel-like nerve compression.\n\nAlso, thanks for all your wonderful input, but I would really appreciate some sources.",

The sensory fibers are the outside of the nerve(insulative portion of the cable) and the motor fibers are the inside(copper wire).\n\nThus when compressing the nerve the outer layers are effected first and the inner fibers require more compression and time to be effected compared to the outer. This leads to sensory deficits superseding motor deficits.",

Weakness and muscle atrophy is a hallmark sign of nerve entrapment, although I agree that sensory effects often seem more immediately noticeable.\n\nPerhaps unconscious proprioceptive feedback circuits modulate motor tone to compensate for mild weakness and ensure normal posture. Or perhaps somatosensory deficit is more bothersome and therefore more consciously noticeable. Or perhaps it has to do with a difference in fiber physiology or myelination. I'd guess it has more to do with the first 2, and its simply that the body is more consciously aware of sensory deficit while mild motor deficit is handled more unconsciously.\n\nEdit: As another person pointed out, the correct answer is that sensory fibers are conveyed around the periphery and motor towards the center of the nerve. Appreciate the love though. I tried my best.",

            "comment": "When a body part is compressed, the pressure on the sensory nerves that carry information about touch, temperature, and pain can cause temporary disruption of their function. This disruption can lead to paresthesia, which is an abnormal sensation like tingling, numbness, or burning. In more severe cases, the compression can cause anesthesia, which is a complete loss of sensation in the affected area.\n\nOn the other hand, motor neurons that control voluntary movement are less affected by compression because they are less sensitive to pressure. These neurons are located deeper in the body and are more protected by other tissues like muscle and bone. Additionally, motor neurons do not rely on sensory information to generate movement. Instead, they receive signals from the brain and spinal cord that instruct them to contract or relax muscles.\n\nTherefore, even if the sensory neurons are temporarily affected by compression, the motor neurons can still receive signals from the brain and spinal cord and initiate voluntary movements. However, if the compression is severe or prolonged, it can eventually affect the motor neurons as well, leading to paralysis or weakness.",

            "comment": "One clue might be that of course seeing as your sensory neurons are not going to be completely saturated or suppressed in temporary parasthesia -- and certainly not all of them in an area will be -- and the same goes for any motor neurons that you might snag in a similar manner. The difference is that the translation from motor neuron stimulation to motor *movement* involves integrating a lot more components that might mitigate the effect that pinching a couple disparate nerve endings would have.\n\nTaking from [Knudson's Biomechanics](http://www.profedf.ufpr.br/rodackibiomecanica_arquivos/Books/Duane%20Knudson-%20Fundamentals%20of%20Biomechanics%202ed.pdf) (ch. 4 pp. 95--96):\n\n&gt;If the muscle fibers of a motor unit twitch in unison, how does a whole muscle generate a smooth increase in tension? The precise regulation of muscle tension results from two processes: *recruitment* of different motor units and their *firing rate*.\n\n&gt;*Recruitment* is the activation of different motor units within a muscle. ... *Firing rate* or rate coding is the repeated stimulation of a particular motor unit over time. ...\n\n&gt;When muscle is artificially stimulated for research or training purposes to elicit maximal force, the frequency used is usually higher than 60 Hz to make sure that motor unit twitches fuse into a *tetanus*. A *tetanus* is the summation of individual twitches into a smooth increase in muscle tension.\n\n&gt;... at the whole muscle level[,] muscles are activated to in complex synergies to achieve movement or stabilization tasks. Muscles are activated\nin short bursts that coordinate with other forces (external and segmental interactions) to create human movement.\n\nAnd there's a bunch of more details to recruitment and firing rate, and it goes on in complexity and unknowns pursuant to further research. One relevant point is that in many cases you use only one firing per motor neuron, over several different neurons, to create a long smooth complex movement (the example they use is bicycling). Since it's an integrating effect, a single missing signal may not actually cause much of a problem -- but I don't know. Anyway, it's a clue.",

The short term paresthesia you get is actually from compression of arteries that give blood to the nerves. When the nerve has a loss of blood, it starts function poorly. The large motor nerves don\u2019t get affected as quickly because there\u2019s generally more blood flow to these and have more stores nutrients. Eventually though, a motor neuron will get affected, look up \u201cSaturday night palsy\u201d which is basically prolonged compression of the radial nerve I believe.

I suspect that the tingly feeling, while it feels crazy, it\u2019s not all your neurons, if it were it would hurt a lot more, like having the limb shredded or something.  So maybe your neurons are at 80% but it feels like zero",

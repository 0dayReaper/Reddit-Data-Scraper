            "comment": "As far as I know, it\u2019s thought to come from the swim bladder of fish. Fish have a gas storing organ that is typically used to maintain buoyancy. In oxygen poor waters, some fish (aptly called lungfish) evolved many blood vessels on their swim bladder allowing them to gasp some air and have the oxygen diffuse from their bladder into their blood. This eventually became the lungs.",

                    "comment": "Interesting idea but it's actually backwards. The swim bladder of advanced Actinopterygii is in fact a modified lung. Lungfish, Coelocanths, and also Cladistia, represent the primitive condition of having a single lung and no swim bladder, while those Actinopterygii that do have swim bladders sometimes retain a degree of respiratory functionality.\n\nCoelocanths, lungfish and tetrapods never had swimbladders at all. What likely occurred was that the ancestor of the bony fish lived in low oxygen shallow marine environments and evolved lungs, then an adaptive radiation occurred wherein some became ray-finned fish and others, likely those near the coasts, became lobe-finned fish. Swim-bladders likely then evolved in a pelagic context where lungs were less useful, and coelocanths likely lost their lung function as they were pushed deeper underwater into their current niche.\n\nThe Lungfish + Tetrapod clade moved into more inland river ecosystems where keeping and adapting lungs made sense, and eventually left the water more and more often once they were already living in fresh water.\n\nThe tetrapod clade developed paired lungs.\n\nStem amniotes lost their gills.\n\nStem mammals adapted the amniote lungs to have a fractal structure greatly increasing surface area but still function on a \"blind\" basis, exhaling with airflow moving the opposite direction as during inhalation. This made them suited to high energy lifestyles.\n\nStem Archosaurs developed a different modification of the primitive condition, with lungs that include an elaborate network of air sacs throughout the body and have a one way \"through\" flow of air in a series of tubes which reconnect to the lungs, both increasing surface area and breathing efficiency. This made them suited to high energy lifestyles. Even crocodiles have this warm-blooded style lung structure although it's questionable if they get much benefit out of that.\n\nOther reptiles seem to have largely kept the more primitive amniote condition of lungs being a relatively simple structure with a small amount of folding but which isn't a fractal the size of a tennis court inside. This limits their energy. Even at high enough temperatures a reptile does not have the lungs for high aerobic performance.",

So aerated blood is not likely to come from them.  I can think of what might have been other steps along the way, like mudskippers, and amphibians such as axlotl \u2014 it makes sense the evolution would go through animals whose lives are both below and above water.",

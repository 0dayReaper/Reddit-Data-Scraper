    "postText": "I was looking at an infographic about shaded light posts and how they can decrease light pollution, but what about the light itself. We've been transitioning away from the old orange-glow sodium streetlights and moved towards LED lights with more of a \"daylight\" shine to them. But do these different lights impact how much of the night sky we see? Or is it all about brightness?",

            "comment": "They matter somewhat. Bluer light gets more rayleigh scattering, so is in that sense worse for light pollution. The rise of broad-band LEDs also mean that some light pollution filters used in amateur astronomy are becoming increasingly ineffective.",

At least in one application, phosphorous is applied to the LED to achieve a balanced broad-band emission.  These kinds of color balance measurements would be found under the name \"color rendering index\" or \"CRI.\" \n\nAlternatively you could filter the light out by absorbing it at the lens level with a layer that would block/absorb the blue end of the spectrum.   This is how blue light glasses that are supposed to help with eye strain / circadian rhythm issues from screens work. \n\nThe push for high CRI LED is because they illuminates with light more closely resembling sunlight and sunlight is pretty much the basis for what we think \"balanced\" light is.  So you'd have to accept that the light will seem \"off\" to a certain degree.  A really exaggerated version of this would be how things look under single color lights, like red or green lights etc..",

            "comment": "There is a difference. The spectra of gas lamps, including sodium ones, are not continuous like those of white LEDs, leaving spectral gaps. With a properly chosen band-pass filter you could efficiently filter out a large portion of terrestrial light pollution in the visible spectrum, which is no more possible with an LED.\n\nHowever, white LED have at least the benefit of causing virtually no pollution outside visible range (i.e. 400-700 nm).",

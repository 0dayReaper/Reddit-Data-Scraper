What happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370? if there was a transmission pilots could not turn off sending out coordinates, altitude, the basic stuff, would it not help locating it? Just minimal bandwidth usage, doesn't need to update more than every 30 seconds or so. Black box would still be required for storing the bulk of the data though.",

There's excellent world-wide coverage, although the poles are always a problem.  I've worked on military drones that used this as a BLOS (beyond line-of-sight) communications channel to get aircraft location and send waypoints.\n\nIf you move to a higher frequency Ka/Ku satcom system, you'll end up with a much more complicated antenna, an inertial nav system to point the antenna, an antenna power supply / controller, and approval from the aircraft manufacturer and the FAA to fly the thing.  You'll get data rates pushing several hundred kbps (until the plane rolls or yaws faster than the antenna can cope with, or there's lots of precipitation in the air).  The poles are still a problem.  And you just lost a bunch of space in your avionics bays and added drag on the plane that will screw with your fuel economy.\n\nIf you only fly over land, and over land that has cell phone infrastructure, you could go with that.\n\nAnd if you're old school, most over-water flights already have HF ARINC data links, but that's subject to the usual joys of HF - limited bandwidth, intermittent propagation.\n\nEdit to add: This might be silly, but there is excellent satellite reception of maritime AIS data.  If all you want is a plane to reliably send its lat/long/altitude/course/speed, you might be able to get by with that.  It's a 160 MHz signal, and doesn't require much power to reach a satellite.",

It is technically feasible, it is not economically feasible.\n\nFwiw it's around $10,000 per pound just to get something into space, that's not even counting the cost of the system itself. And you need a LOT of those systems. There are over 300,000 cell towers in the US alone and the US only covers 7% of the land area (not even counting water)",

Many many many towers overlap and there are 4 major carriers overlapping as well. A constellation capable of handling low bandwidth real time telemetry data is already being launched at a cost of roughly 3000 dollars per pound. The airlines would just need to pay for access, which they likely won't because they are happy with the current black box system.",

I was seeing optimal latency predictions around 30ms, which is around what current wire speeds are in the US.\n\nEdit: changed latency from between 35 and 75 to around 30ms, but this claim is still not backed up because it's based on a new protocol that no information is known of. I'm not hating on starlink, and I realize latency won't be an issue for people that aren't gaming on their connection, but that's one of the first things I think of when I consider an internet connection.",

It is likely that MH370 broke up on impact, and all of the debris was carried quite a distance from the point of impact, making it nearly impossible to locate.  Additionally, unlike shipwrecks, which tend to be large pieces of the ship, aircraft wreckage tends to spread out more, and blend into the ocean floor.  It took almost 3 years to locate the black boxes of AF447, which hit the ocean at a very low speed, and remained largely intact.  If MH370 hit the ocean at cruise speed like most experts speculate, there likely isn't anything large enough to be located by sonar, and the wreckage may have been passed over multiple times by search teams, or dispersed throughout the ocean.",

It then immediately disappeared from radar, did a sharp turn southwest and the next time it was seen was just heading on a straight shot towards Antarctica. The pilot brought the plane up to an elevation above what was considered safe on the turn, arched the plane and killed every passenger aboard by destabilizing the cabin pressure.\n\nWhen he turned the automated/full systems back on to re-stabilize, the plane\u2019s location pinged enough times for them to chart a line graph course from it. The plane\u2019s last known location was far out in the southern sea before Antarctica and then shot straight down into the ocean, probably running out of fuel.\n\nIt\u2019s not known why this was done, and as far as we know that black box may never be recoverable as it\u2019s in unexplored, no traffic deep southern sea.",

                            "comment": "# tl;dr\n\n***The short answer: Yes, starlink likely resolves the issue and there would be enough bandwidth for airplanes to stream their black box data. BUT the stream would not replace the blackbox, just act as a backup/secondary/alternative***\n\n# The long answer\n\nNow for the long-winded technical details for those interested. Sorry it's so long.\n\nFor context, the two major technologies used to transmit avionics data is [ARINC-429](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARINC_429) and [MIL STD-1553](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIL-STD-1553). For the tech savvy, 429 is similar to UDP: you send data out and don't care if the recipients get it (it's not a reliable protocol). 1553 is like TCP because it IS reliable because it's a command-and-response protocol. \n\n# Example Avionics:\nFor the examples below, I'll assume a nominal amount of avionics equipment. Typical avionics you see on an aircraft include:\n\n* AHRS (Attitude Heading Reference System)\n\n* ADC (Air Data Computer)\n\n* GPS (The kind you know and love)\n\n* INU (Inertial Reference Unit; kind of like a back up of AHRS and GPS)\n\n* Autopilot \n\n* Engine(s)\n\n* Control Surfaces (ailerons, elevators, rudder) - these aren't necessarily electronic. Sometimes they're hydraulic/pneumatic but there's still usually some device that's recording/reporting torques on servos and whatnot\n\n* TCAS (Traffic collision avoidance system)\n\n* ADS-B\n\n* Landing gear\n\n* Radio Altimeter (collects height above ground)\n\n* Doppler radar (collects speeds/accelerations relative to ground)\n\n* Weather radar\n\nThe most complex aircraft systems I've seen had about 40-50 avionics devices transmitting data that would be recorded by the black box (and that includes the redundancy of devices)\n\n\n# The important parts:\n\n429 and 1553 are simple enough that we can easily compute how much data they use, and I'll assume 50 devices as mentioned above.\n\n\n# ARINC-429\n429 transmits everything with 32 bit words, the first 8 of which is a 'label'. Each label describes a unique piece of data. For example, if the label is equal to the number 100 then perhaps it is \"True Airspeed\". Any time label 100 is seen on that same bus, it is going to be true airspeed.\n\nThe confounding factors for 429: Since labels need to be unique, and there's lots of data to transmit on an airplane (definitely more than just 256 pieces of information), you need multiple ARINC-429 buses to accommodate the data. As originally designed, in fact, you need an ARINC-429 bus for each piece of avionics equipment that transmits data.\n\nARINC-429 operates at a top frequency of 100 Hz. If there are 50 devices transmitting all 256 labels (which are each 32-bits) at 100 Hz, that comes out to 50 devices \\* 256 labels * 32 bits each * 100 = 26,214,400 bits per second. This comes out to ***4.883 Megabytes/second***. (1 Megabyte = 1024 * 1024 bytes)\n\nBus redundancy just multiplies it, and most airplanes are only dual redundant, so 9.766 MB/s is the upper bound of data on 429.\n\n# MIL STD-1553\n\n1553 allows a Bus Controller (BC) and 32 Remote Terminals (RT) on a bus (or is it 1 BC and 31 RTs....I forget). Let's just assume a BC isn't an RT and that we have 32 RTs. Also for simplicity, let's assume we only care about RT-to-BC communications. BC-to-RT is likely duplicate data, and RT-to-RT certainly is. A black box participates as a \"Bus Monitor\" and just listens/records everything on the bus.\n\nLuckily, up above we figured we had 32 devices and that's where one 1553 maxes out, so we'll just assume one 1553 bus. The BC requests data from RTs, and it instructs the RT where to send that data by indicating a Subaddress (SA). A single RT/SA message can contain up to 32 pieces of information that are each 16 bits. There are a total of 32 SAs.\n\nSo we have 50 devices * 32 RTs \\* 32 SAs * 32 Words per message * 16 bits per word = 26,214,400 bits to represent the *entire* bus at an instant in time. The maximum frequency on 1553 is 50 Hz, so this turns into ***156.25 MB/s***\n\n# Conclusion\n\n*I cannot stress enough how these are upper bounds - even large aircraft do not have saturated 429/1553 buses. Most devices don't send data on all labels or RT/SA pairs, and most messages are not at the max data rate. In reality, 1 MB/s is likely sufficient. The calculations are to offer rough orders of magnitude.*\n\nThe upside: In a realistic setting we're talking about data rates that are less than a 1080p stream, and there are more people streaming 1080p than there are planes in the sky. Starlink's ultimate goal is to offer a 'normal' internet experience to many people (as opposed to geostationary internet satellites which have low data rates and high latency, Starlink's goal is meeting the needs of average internet users in the US, including streaming movies at low latencies).\n\nThe downsides: \n\n1. If the blackbox stream-transmitter is the first thing to die, or it loses connection (like if the plane turns upside down or spins too fast to transmit data) then you'll never have all the information and would have to revert to the blackbox itself. So it can't replace a blackbox. But it can be a backup/secondary/alternative. \n\n2. The data also has to be stored, and thousands of planes could be petabytes or exabytes of data (really depends on how much it needs to persist). Not impossible, but certainly expensive. \n\n3. There's also timing considerations. Since we already know the stream isn't replacing a blackbox but just acting as a backup/secondary/alternative, we don't need to worry about real-time issues. As long as the transmitter time tags based on the aircraft's system/GPS time the data can be properly ordered on the receiving end.\n\n*Disclaimer: I changed the number of devices I used for estimates (to a higher number) part way through. I tried to edit everything but I might've missed something*\n\n# Addendum\n\nAfter reading other responses throughout the thread, I wanted to point out that this would give you the ability to 'see' what the aircraft equipment sees, not just position data (as others have stated can already be done via ADS-B and other technologies), which is an important aspect of a blackbox.",

            "comment": "A black box is two data recorders, one that's recording real-time information about plane and one that's recording voice. \n\nThe information is useful after a crash, or after a near miss/emergency, but it's not particularly useful any other time. \n\nIt's hard to estimate how many planes fly a day, but based on FAA information on [faa.gov](https://faa.gov), just the US FAA handles: 16,100,000 flights a year (including international flights that enter FAA areas). That's 44,000+ daily flights. There are 5000 planes in the sky at any time at peak travel just in the US alone. \n\nIn 2019 there were 14 fatal crashes *globally.* \n\nThe amount of real-time data streaming you'd need to track even just the domestic commercial flights, plus cargo flights would be staggering. Streaming telemetry and voice from the entirety of a flight's transit would require massive amounts of data, storage and processing. And it's only needed those 14 times a year. \n\nThere are limited ways to transmit data from a plane, you've got terrestrial and satellite. Terrestrial wouldn't work, there are too many hops between towers. Satellite would be available, but someone would have to put the satellites up just to record flight data. If you've ever seen how crappy in-flight WiFi is, imagine how bad having to move the data from 16 million flights would be. \n\nYou couldn't rely on that transmission either, because it's another system to go down, satellites lose communication etc. \n\nThe flight data recorders and cockpit voice recoders are designed to survive 3400Gs and temperatures exceeding 1000\u00ba C (1830\u00ba F). \n\nThe NTSB has proposed cockpit image recorders as well, because control panels are now electronic\u2014when a plane crashed with an analog gauge it usually stayed on the last position at impact. LCD screens just break.   \n\n\n(A good overview is here [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight\\_recorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_recorder))\n\nIn 2014 after the Malaysia flight vanished, there were pushes to make planes transmit their data or to eject from planes before crashes. \n\nHouse Rep David Price called for black boxes that would eject after Malaysia Flight 370 vanished. \n\n\"But he said the 9/11 Commission recommended after the terrorist hijackings in 2001 that planes carry ejectable \"black boxes\" to make them easier to find. Navy planes have carried them for years, and Transportation Security Administration was given $3.5 million in 2008 to study and test the proposal.\"\n\nWhich is good except, it's not moving along very well. The same article from that quote points out that F/A 18 Navy jets have black boxes that eject on impact detection, or when the ejection seat is triggered, and they float at well. \n\nIn many cases, you don't need a FDR and CVR to figure out what happened, though of course they're always helpful as they show you exactly how the crew and the plane reacted. In the 14 2019 incidents, one was an attempted hijacking . There was no crash, the hijacker was killed, so that's considered a flight-based fatality for some reason. Three were planes that overshot the runways. The reason for those crashes is almost always pilot error. \n\nThere was one bird strike (cause of crash, birds), one was a collision between two planes (cause of crash, collision), one plane hit the runway twice, banked, and hit a building. Passengers who evacuated via the wing-exits slipped on ice on the wing. (cause of crash, ice). One had a plane flying through thunderstorms.\n\nIn a few of them the cause of the crash was determined via FDR or CVR, and several were crew error. \n\nSo to answer your question, there haven't been a lot of researchers thrown at this because it's a problem that would cost an astronomical amount to implement and would only matter in those cases where the black boxes were not retrievable anyhow.",

The Black Box itself doesn't hold data for a long period of time but must overwrite it after a fixed period because it's so large.  For a central database to hold all this information for all aircraft real time would not be feasible at this time in our technological development.

They're able to be activated through a switch in the cockpit or through a G-force switch, so in the event of a crash the ELT activates itself. They broadcast on 3 specific frequencies, 121.5, 243, and 406 MHz, and they're typically located on the tail section of a plane which is the most likely to survive intact during a crash. They have their own batteries.\n\nMy assumptions as to why so many planes aren't found is that one, the batteries only last so long; two, I'm not sure how well everything holds up to water damage in the event of an ocean crash; and three, there's no guarantee that the ELT will actually survive the crash in general.\n\nSource: I'm an aircraft mechanic.",

            "comment": "This is something I might be able to contribute to. I was previously a director in the aerospace communications industry and one of my roles was to manage a team that sold connectivity to airlines and aircraft operators. I did this all over the world, including Asia and I regularly wrote articles, gave presentations and spoke on panels as it relates to connectivity and aircraft tracking. \n\nThe short answer is that it\u2019s down to technology and cost. Forgive me if some of this is repetitive, as I've not read through all of the comments.\n\nThere\u2019s a technology called ACARS (Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System) that's been around since the 1970s and it sends information via Very High Frequency (VHF) radio as a data transmission. Think of an old school text message for airplanes. Some messages are automated like engine reports and departure messages where the aircraft sends a signal that it has taken off and landed. There are also some manual messages that the pilots can send from the cockpit. VHF is limited by line-of-sight, and a typical VHF ground station can only cover a certain distance, much like a cell phone tower. This is generally around 200 nautical miles at 20,000 feet altitude. VHF stations aren't that big, about the size of a vending machine but they're expensive to deploy and it's a complicated process to obtain and maintain government permissions to legally operate in any country. So while there are VHF ground stations that transmit this data all over the world, it\u2019s still not worldwide because there\u2019s not always a business case for it. Africa is a perfect example where coverage is still sparse. Additionally, due to the range issue, flights over open water do not generally have VHF coverage once you're far enough away from a ground station. \n\nAnother supplementary technology exists called High Frequency (HF) radio. The major benefit of HF is that it's much longer range than VHF. While the stations are generally much larger than their VHF counterparts, there are far fewer of them given their capabilities. HF is usually a cheaper option that satellite and many aircraft use HF when they fly across the pond. \n\nBoth VHF and HF are used for voice and data transmissions every day in the commercial airlines and they are considered very standard means of direct and indirect communication with the ground. The issue is one firstly of cost. The major providers of VHF and HF connectivity for aircraft around the world generally charge based on volume. The more data sent and received, the more it costs. Although there are some specially crafted plans in place and the costs of data transmissions have gotten cheaper, much of the technology on-board aircraft was designed to minimize the amount of data that's sent or received from an aircraft. Secondly, they don't have anywhere near the bandwidth capability to support the high volume data transmissions that would be required for these types of transmissions. These mediums can and do, however, facilitate the transmission of simpler text based messages pertaining to engine conditions, position reports, and manually entered crew messages amongst many others. \n\nNow come satellite communications or SATCOM. SATCOM has been around for decades and is really nothing new. The largest users are the maritime and aviation industries. The major and likely obvious benefit of SATCOM is that satellites are orbiting the Earth and as such aren't limited by terrain. Thus, they can work well if an aircraft is operating far out to sea where terrestrial based ground stations cannot reach. Generally speaking, SATCOM has been wired into aircraft to act as the backup for your VHF and HF connections. Think of this like VHF and HF are your home based WiFi network, but once you leave the house, SATCOM takes over. The first few satellite systems launched were quite limited in their bandwidth and further, they were horrendously expensive to use. If I remember correctly, a call from an aircraft satellite phone (SAT phone) could reach as much as $20 per minute. It's far cheaper now, but still a significant cost over a fleet of aircraft. It costs a lot of money to build, launch and maintain a satellite network so naturally, it was going to be expensive. Airlines operate on thin margins and are notorious for keeping costs to a minimum, thus SATCOM much in the same way as VHF and HF are concerned, was to be used very sparingly and only for specific purposes, if the aircraft is equipped at all. The pilots and aircraft dispatchers that I worked with during my career are still very much in the habit of keeping messages and aircraft phone calls as short as possible due to the legacy of lengthy messages being more costly.\n\nSATCOM is also capable of sending both data and voice transmissions and relatively recently, high throughput transmissions to provide internet connectivity. Today, SATCOM on an aircraft is becoming far more common and much cheaper. Fly a commercial airline today and you're quite likely to have WiFi service available to you, some free of charge and some with a cost to the consumer, the passenger. As the demand grows for connectivity, more companies are looking to increase network capacity and increase available bandwidth and so more advanced satellites are being launched to take advantage of this growing market. Two important points to note here are the bandwidth and cost of this service. I would argue today that the bandwidth is capable of supporting a constant stream of data transmissions from the aircraft relevant to the FDR and CVR, but this is only very recently that this is so. Further, the systems were not all designed to constantly transmit data on an open connection which would be a requirement to provide the \"streaming\" that you're referring to.  \n\nThe last point here is the cost. Satellite services are still very expensive to all aircraft operators. Although the costs are lowering, it's still very expensive to firstly equip the aircraft with the appropriate avionics (computer and instrumentation for your aircraft) and to pay for that data connection. A large aircraft fleet such as Emirates, can afford lower pricing based on volume. A business jet operator that operates only one aircraft, however, is not so lucky and they can pay prices that are nearly $8 (USD) per Megabyte (MB) if volume based or between $6 - $25 per minute for a streaming service. It was not unusual for a customer to see invoices in the thousands of dollars for a single month for a single aircraft for satellite data services alone. Even Emirates will likely pay cents per MB which spread across their entire fleet is no small sum of money. In summation, it's still a very expensive service. \n\nSo, those are the general means of communication. I did see some comments related to ADS-B and while that's related and a super cool topic, particularly space-based ADS-B and the partnerships between Irdium, Aireon and FlightAware, ADS-B still does not generally provide the type and volume of data that that's stored within the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) and the Flight Data Recorder (FDR). These two separate \"boxes\" record very specific parameters on-board the aircraft which aid in a determination of the causation of an accident. So while ADS-B information would certainly be helpful in determining the possible location of a lost aircraft and even assist in any possible accident investigation, the picture is not complete without the entire data set that's stored within these two instruments. \n\nWhy is this now a question that comes up all of the time and where do we go from here? Well, although aircraft have been disappearing since the beginning of air travel, the technology today is so advanced that of course we couldn't lose an aircraft, right? Air France Flight 447 and Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 are two very big catalysts for a shift in paradigm and these two incidents have drawn attention to the limitations to aircraft tracking and communications. In my role in the aviation industry, I saw this as likely to change. As more and more data is automatically pulled from the aircraft, bandwidth increases and the cost decreases, I think it will be likely to see raw flight parameter data being transmitted to the ground and further, I expect that civil aviation authorities will be more inclined to mandate the use of a Quick Access Recorder (QAR) and or other technologies which require the date to be routinely stored and transmitted. \n\nLet me know if you'd like further info or any any sources. \n\nTL:DR: Sending data from an aircraft is still quite complex and very expensive.",

Every time there is a crash traffic drops, and you can bleed money really really fast. Maintenance costs, hanger rent, labor, and perhaps the worst *jetfuel*. It's stupidly volatile, hard to budget for, and when the price jumps it can eat profit margin overnight. Major weather fucks us too.

            "comment": "Well... the short answer is: that's not really their job.  Essentially, planes are always kind of doing that anyway.  They are, in various ways, in regular communication with the rest of the system.  They've already got ways of communicating everything that they should need to communicate with everyone that they should need to communicate it with as they need to do so.\n\nBut unexpected things happen. And when they do happen, after the fact, once the emergency bit has been taken care of, the question becomes 'what exactly happened'  so that we can figure out if something that should have stopped this from happening failed to do its job, or if there was something we didn't even know to worry about that we should pay more attention to in the future.  That's the job of the black box, to let us figure out what happened after the fact.\n\nIf we did hook up the black box so that it was constantly communicating everything it knew in real time, that wouldn't actually be terribly useful.  Most flights go as expected.  Massive amounts of information would have to be communicated over great distances and 999 times out of 1000, actually even more often than that, that information wouldn't ever need to be glanced at, because the parts of it that needed to be know are already known by the people who need to know, the pilots.\n\nSo, what about that one in a thousand, or more accurately, one in a million situation, could that information be used to save lives?  Probably not.  Because it isn't enough to have the information, we have to know what it means.  The people who analyze the black box information are trained to do that.  They're also doing it with access to other information, like what exactly happened, so they're comparing what they know from the wreckage and eye witness accounts, etc, to what the black box is telling them.\n\nIn order for there to be any point to having a black box in constant communication, we'd need someone to be able to analyze the information as it's coming in.\n\nThe day may come when we have AIs who can take in all of that information, analyze it in real time, and spot problems before they become disasters, and when that day comes, hopefully we'll be in a position to set up black boxes in the way you described, but for right now, the amount of data the black box records is mostly useful in looking back to figure out what happened.",

            "comment": "In computer engineering, there is actually not physically possible to do anything in \"real-time\", as you call it. There will always be delays due to hardware limitations, the algorithms processing and handling the data and of course bandwidth (aka signal processing). In other words, several layers of technology are communicating and dependent on the layer \"below\". \nAlso, as someone here pointed out, there is a huge amount of data collected (telemetry and parameters, voice recordings etc.) , and it would be impossible to stream it all in \"real-time\". So instead, they prioritize important information the air traffic control needs in order to coordinate the air space. They send this data on low frequencies which results in a low bandwidth, but has a huge transmittion range. Otherwise we would need radar stations everywhere... And even this minimum information is delayed, so I believe the algorithms at the air traffic control are using interpolation and extrapolation to calculate and predict future data based on earlier data, and then corrects itself if needed when the real data comes in from the plane. But I haven't personally looked at these protocols, so I can't say for sure, but it's a fairly common concept in, for instance multiplayer games over the internet.\n\nSo yeah, that's why we can't just stream to a remote area. It would require a fairly complex system in order to work. And money is a huge factor when it comes to this. Some questions  have to be asked and answered. So one would have to do a cost-benefit analysis (CBA). First of all, is the investment worth it? What's the benefits of such a system? Does the current black box system work? And so on...\nObviously, we don't find it worth our time and money to improve it, because the current system works. As long as we find the box...",

            "comment": "The biggest issue is the amount of data. One rolls Royce engine can generate terabytes if data. The F22 has a wire harness made out of optical fibers because copper simply didn\u2019t have enough bandwidth to carry the amount of data that plane generates. Even if there were a bunch of multi band antennas at x-band (7-11ghz) our max throughput on one channel is 1-2gbps depending on data protection which needs to be high. The plane frequently generates much more than this. The thing that\u2019ll get us there is laser data transmission. 900nm doesn\u2019t absorb super well in atmosphere so you could use it for long range data transmission at insane rates. (Frequency is about 300ghz) and that could do it but the infrastructure will be highly complex and the range would still be lower than VHF and KA band which is what most planes use today",

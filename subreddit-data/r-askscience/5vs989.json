It will however try to keep its orientation due to gyroscopic effects. This is sometime used on spacecraft to either stabilise them or to turn them (with moment gyros).  [Here is a great video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni4j5K4Lz3o) of my favorite astronaut Dr Don Pettit inventing new yoyo tricks on board the international space station.",

The lack of stress caused by not being all stuffy might not actually effect his health, but he might be more comfortable or less inconvenienced than a baby with body fluid distribution issues. \n\nAre even these small things considered pressures?

In the middle there is a disk spinning very fast. \n\nIt's pretty late here so I won't go into too much detais but the cool thing with a fast spinning object is that if you apply a torque perpendicular to its axis of rotation you get a constant rotation velocity along the axis perpendicular to both your torque axis and the original rotation axis. On [this picture](https://s32.postimg.org/lnd3yo31x/image056.gif) body D is rotating on axis 1, if you apply a torque along axis 2 with motor 2 you get a rotation along axis 3. This is pretty useful because the rotation velocity is directly proportional to the torque you apply. So not only you can spin the spacecraft but you can also stop it very easily. And best of all you don't need any propellant for that, just a a bit of electricity.",

More like in one of those \"I should be more on the lookout for girls who just show a general curiosity, open-mindedness, and thirst for knowledge\" kinda ways.\n\nThis guy is one hell of a class act.

He uses this to get it spinning probably because he doesn't want to accidentally hit something if he throws it badly. ",

Gravity plays no real part in basic yoyoing, only in certain tricks",

If you did that in space it would immediately bounce back because of the tension in the string caused by throwing the yoyo down and the absence of gravity to counteract the snap that lets the yoyo wind itself back up again.\n\nA lot of yoyo tricks and basic yoyoing rely on gravity to constantly pull the yoyo tight against the string which wouldn't happen in space unless the yoyo has momentum other than it spinning about its axis. You'd have to adapt basically everything about it if you were doing it in space because as soon as you throw it out it would bounce back at you almost as fast.",

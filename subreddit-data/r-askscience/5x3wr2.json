If we break the colors into the RGB components, the green will be something like R:0 G:200 B:50, and the grey will be R:100 G:100 G:100, that is, much more red component and much less green component.\n\nThe eye/brain's color processing is super complex, but the most simple version is that we take a lot of cues from the *differences* between shades, and not their absolute values.",

The image absolutely does have the red information in there - just that it's a red as seen relative to the cyan\\*.  If it didn't have that, then something close to the original image (see other comments) couldn't be recovered from it.  \n\nHere's the same image, but *actually* all-cyan: http://i.imgur.com/6Y9m1WH.png  \n\\* It's cyan.

It's not like if you disassembled the checkerboard, threw the green cylinder in the trash and held block A and block B up to the light you'd find they're the same colour.

When I looked directly at the ceiling, I couldn't see it.   I spent more time than I should have moving my eyes from the left to the right (looking away and then directly at it) to see this effect.

Being able to detect objects in our environment is obviously vital, and indeed that's why we have colour constancy.",

Knowing the actual color of  light hitting your eyes is generally both unnecessary and misleading: what's important is knowing the actual color of the object reflecting that light.  And accounting for lighting does that.  Otherwise, eg, you'd have a very hard time finding your car when you park it during the day and come looking for it in the evening.  \n\nWe generally have to resort to highly contrived illusions to make this system produce errors.\n",

Your brain also knows that dark things can look gold-ish when they're in bright sunlight. In the photo of the dress, it is obviously a sunny day, but it's not clear if the dress is in shadow or in the light.\n\nThe actual pixels of the dress are blue and gold, which you can verify with an eyedropper tool. If you think the dress is in shadow, your brain compensates by lightening the blue to white, and the dress looks white and gold. If you think the dress is in bright sunlight, your brain compensates by darkening the gold to black, and the dress looks blue and black.\n",

The most common adjustment we're used to is seeing a light object under a shadow, and that is white/gold lookers perceived the dress. It looked like it was being shadowed in a brightly lit room. The blue/black lookers interpreted the camera flash as to having flushed out all the color and applying a yellow filter to everything. By changing perspective between the literal pixels and an adjusted perception of the flash, one could see it both ways.",

Every time I saw the dress that first day it was *clearly* blue and black and I could not for the life of me understand the white/gold view. However, way late that night, like 2AM, after having been in the dark for hours staring at a bright screen I saw the image again and **BOOM**, White/Gold. I remember shaking my head, changing tabs, then looking back and it was back to blue and black.\n\nRegardless, the reason is that creamy or white colors can look blue-ish in shade. Not *that* dark blue, but still have a blue tint. \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/9N4KNLn.jpg",

I guess the crazy thing is how quickly and definitively our minds make a subconscious decision about what colors we see. For me the the dress was always white and gold.

When you're 20, 1 year = 5%. It actually makes sense that every year is shorter, because proportionally it is.\n\nEdit: Thinking about it, it actually parallels the image that OP posted really well. We perceive colours in relation to the colours that we know (around them). In a similar way, we perceive time in relation to what we know (time we've already experienced). So, every moment of time we experience in the future is slightly shorter as a proportion of every other moment we've already experienced. If that makes sense. Which it did in my mind before I tried to type it out. Now I'm confused. I think I should get off the internet at this point.",

As a child you are constantly learning and experiencing new things. You have different grades and different activities. Waiting for summer break, graduating junior high, etc. And this continues on through high school (and college) until you become an adult.\n\nBut at some point you turn into a normal adult. You have a steady job, you work a consistent schedule. The years stop mattering as much not because you've experienced more of them, but because this year is largely similar to last year and will largely be similar to next year. Short of major life events (moving far away, marriage, kids, buying a house), your life becomes fairly regular with no big changes. That makes it much harder to notice that time is still moving by.

Their peak sensitivities are to wavelengths that we experience as those colors (if we are not colorblind). It is more accurate to describe them as short, medium, and long cones to indicate the range of wavelengths that they are most sensitive to independent of any psychological interpretation / experience of those wavelengths as a particular color. That is, we're describing the cones by their sensory properties, not by the types of experiences our visual system gives rise to.",

How does the brain deal with merging those two images where they overlap, or reconcile the differences in color where they don't overlap? For example, if you have the ocean filling your entire field of view, would there be a gradient of color from left to right instead of the entire thing appearing blue?",

Here's an imgur link to my experiments: http://imgur.com/a/y9TGC\n\nI made it an indexed image with 3 colors: black, white, and blue.  Zoomed out, the berries look red (so it wasn't the varied shades of gray causing it).\n\nThe more you zoom in, the effect goes away.  I was staring at it up close, then would zoom out slowly and there was like a magic % zoom where the colors would just kind of pop in - really weird. \n\nI have a cousin-in-law that has a degree in art/painting/color theory and said it had to do with the color white, since it's made of all colors.  I tried replacing the white with a ton of different colors, and the illusion immediately goes away.\n\nI then did some color corrections (curves) and re-indexed it with 5 colors: red, green, blue, black, white - and was able to recreate what the original image probably was.

I made [this](http://i.imgur.com/1kAuSVB.gif) using only grey and two different shades of blue and you can still see red. The problem is that red is a relatively \"bright\" color so you need at least one bright primary like cyan, yellow, or green to dither it with.\n\nWhite isn't even really a color, and I don't just mean that in \"well technically...\" kind of way. The \"white point\" is kind of an arbitrary color that you reference to compare other colors to. Since you can choose and change your color reference, this white point isn't constant, so even the concept of \"white\" as a single color is kind of fuzzy.\n\nIf you really want to get precise about color, you'll have to look at spectral power distributions which measure which wavelengths of photons actually exist, but then this has very little relation to color as we perceive it.",

A green tinted monochrome picture could not achieve the same effect, otherwise black and white TVs could have reproduced colour just by having a green filter in front.\nThe image is green/blue and grey.  That's significant because the grey contains reds, greens and blues within it - whites and greys appear neutral because they contain the other colours in equal degrees.  The red is not coming from no-where - it is actually there.  The green/blue tint of parts of the picture that should be neutral leads your brain to automatically compensate by removing the greens/blues from the whole of the picture - thereby bringing out the reds *that were already there* in the grey parts.

It is green tinted and desaturated, meaning individually, the colors look pretty not-red. But there is red in the components of the color.\n\n2. So if you look at the RGB values, the berry color is around (173, 182, 181), and the table is (158, 225, 208). You can see, there is significantly more \"red\" in the berries both absolutely (173 to 158) and relatively (the G and B components go from ~180 to 208-225). \n\nSo the only really remarkable thing is that when you look at the colors individually you see green and grey. It just turns out that putting those two next to each other highlights the relatively high amount of red in the \"grey\" color.",

            "comment": "EDIT: TL;DR view these images I made first: http://imgur.com/a/42m1K\n\nTHERE ARE RED PIXELS IN THE IMAGE! Each physical \"pixel\" on your display has 3 channels - red, green, and blue. Something on the screen appears white when the brightness is 100% for all 3 channels. We see black when they are all off, and we see gray when the brightness of each channel is equivalent but less than 100% (for example R:70% G:70% B:70%). We perceive different colors on a phone, computer, TV, etc... when the ratio between the RGB channels changes, and unless the \"pure\" color is being displayed, all 3 RGB channels will all be active. In other words, intensity differences between these 3 channels within a pixel create the perception of different colors. Although something may appear blue, it will actually contain varying degrees of red and green as well. This means that RED LIGHT IS PHYSICALLY EMANATING from your screen in the strawberry image!!! You can verify this yourself by using a strong magnifying glass (a pocket microscope would be best)!\n\nThis will help to visualize what I am talking about: http://cdn.bigshotcamera.com/images/learn/LCD/color_pixel.jpg\nIf this image were actual size, you would see (from left to right) a red, green, and blue rectangle on the top row and a white, followed by black rectangle on the bottom row: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/LCD_pixels.jpg\n\nBut zooming in to the strawberries or sampling the color in photoshop looks grey - why? Well when you zoom an image it gets \"pixelated\" and you begin to see defined squares. Zoom in enough and you can see individual pixels right? Not exactly. These are *rendered* pixels, meaning that if you were able to somehow physically stretch your screen to the same size, you would see that same gray color. In reality however, you would see the three RGB bars - the gray color displayed is the rendering/ sum/ blend of the 3 channels in that pixel and the color that should theoretically exist. \n\nRecall earlier I said that gray is perceived on a screen when the RGB values are of equal but less than 100% brightness. This is a bit oversimplified because the values do not need to be exactly equal, gray starts to be seen as white around 90% brightness, and there are other factors as well. However, it is IMPORTANT to note that things we see as gray will have approximately the same intensity for each channel. This means that the viral strawberry image DOES SHOW RED LIGHT! If you still don't believe me, I imported the linked image into photoshop and made some edits. I also used my phone's camera focused through the pocket microscope to demonstrate what was happening on the actual laptop screen: http://imgur.com/a/42m1K",

            "comment": "So, you are stretching \"realistic\" physics a bit to build a Dyson sphere in the first place - it might take more material than is actually available in the Solar System, and even then a solid shell would require some science fiction materials and be gravitationally unstable. A swarm of small stations whose orbits completely completely cover the star is a bit more realistic. But regardless, any question on Dyson spheres is going to be limited in scope if it's not touching more on science fiction than actual science.\n\nBut if we do apply realistic physics, it turns out that a Dyson sphere (whatever form it takes) must emit just as much light as the star itself did. By conservation of energy, if the Dyson sphere is absorbing more energy than it is emitting, then it is heating up, and it can't just heat up forever.\n\nWhat happens here is that the \"outside\" of the Dyson sphere will emit energy in the form of infrared radiation, and this will have exactly the same luminosity as the star it surrounds. Power plants don't \"use\" energy, they convert it from a \"more useful\" low-entropy form into a \"less useful\" high-entropy form, doing \"work\" along the way.\n\nHere, distant objects orbiting the Dyson sphere may still be warmed quite a bit by this warm low frequency radiation. Objects will not be heated as much as they would be by the \"hot\" radiation of the star, particularly nearby objects, as the Dyson sphere's radiation is emitted from a larger area than the star's radiation, but it won't be nearly as bad as having zero radiation from the object.",

Holding a wormhole open or something, because at this stage why not. That could reduce the external temperature by a lot. \n\nIn any case, the first rule of the Dyson sphere club is not to build one around your home star!",

By conservation of energy, if the Dyson sphere is absorbing more energy than it is emitting, then it is heating up, and it can't just heat up forever.\n\nI don't think that's sound thermodynamics. It could be using that energy to increase its *internal energy*. Not indefinitely, of course, but it could be stashing that energy by, e.g., driving endothermal reactions or speeding up a giant flywheel.",

The radiation is less directed, which makes it more difficult to use heat shields and radiators for thermal management, but if we assume a dumb spherical blackbody then it'll receive the same radiation, still given by the inverse square law.",

The same amount of radiation is being emitted, still in all directions. Shouldn't any object still receive the same amount of energy from it?\n\nIf I'm standing on a planet and I watch the sun get replaced by a Dyson sphere, the sphere's surface will be much dimmer than the star's surface was, but it will take up a much bigger chunk of sky. It seems to me that these effects cancel out, and the total amount of EM energy hitting my planet would remain the same. Maybe I'm missing something in the math.",

There is also the thermodynamics aspect: with a star inside the box (sphere), the energy has to go somewhere.

Earth cannot evacuate all the energy emitted by the surface of the sun without itself being warmer than the surface of the sun, so we will have to move that heat to the Dyson sphere or a second Dyson sphere to emit it. \n\nThe IR will warm the rest of the solar system unless that energy is moved as electricity outside the solar system. They won't have visible light anymore however.",

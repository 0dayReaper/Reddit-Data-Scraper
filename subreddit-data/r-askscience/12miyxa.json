            "comment": "So, it's not the gene itself that's dominant or recessive - it's traits resulting from variations in that gene (different variations of a gene are called alleles). \n\nGenes typically encode a protein that has a specific function in the cell. For example, a gene might encode an enzyme that makes the pigment that makes eyes brown. Another allele of that gene might make a protein that is non-functional. If we have one copy of the functional gene, and one of the non-functional, pigment is still made and the eyes are still brown. So brown eyes are a dominant trait because you only need one copy of that allele. Blue eyes only happen when you have two non-functional copies and so no pigment is made at all.\n\nBasically - in the majority of cases, recessive traits are those that result from an allele which has a loss of function, and dominant ones from an allele that is still working. In practice there are complications and exceptions to this, but that is the basic principle.",

The 3 recognized colorings\u2014yellow, black, and chocolate\u2014are controlled by 2 different genes that have simple dominant/recessive phenotypes.\n\nOne of gene codes for a receptor protein, I think, that controls the deposition of eumelanin pigment (which is responsible for black/brown colors in skin and hair) into the hair. The recessive mutation(s?) break the functioning of the receptor, so if there are two copies of the recessive gene, the fur won\u2019t have any eumelanin, which results in the yellow^* coat color. But if there is one copy that codes for the functioning receptor, eumelanin will be present in the fur, so the dark coat colors are dominant over yellow.\n\nThe second gene codes for an enzyme that\u2019s involved in melanin synthesis. The gene has a few possible mutations that basically make the enzyme non-functional, which (for reasons I don\u2019t totally understand) causes the produced eumelanin pigment to have a brown color instead of black. If there is at least one copy of this gene that codes for the functioning enzyme, then the eumelanin will be black. So, black eumelanin is the dominant phenotype over brown. In labs that have the phenotype where eumelanin is expressed in the fur, this gene determines black vs chocolate coloration. It affects the melanin color in the skin as well, so the phenotype is visible even in yellow labs. All black labs have black noses, and all chocolate labs have brown noses, but a yellow lab can have either a black or brown nose!\n\nTaken all together, we can see that yellow labs are the result of a recessive-recessive combo, which means that yellow labs \u201cbreed true\u201d. Black labs, on the other hand, are dominant-dominant, so 2 black labs bred together can produce a litter with all 3 colorings represented.\n\n^* Note that there is a very wide color variation in the \u201cyellow\u201d category, ranging from white to red-orange. This is due to differences in the expression of pheomelanin, which is responsible for yellow and red pigments in skin and hair. The pheomelanin expression is more complex, I believe.",

There are a decent number of examples in humans that are in reality controlled by a single gene and it's dominant/recessive status, but eye color is not one of them. Eye color is a spectrum with a lot of variables that contribute to it which don't create a binary situation where it one parent has green eyes and the other rhas brown eyes their children will only have either green or brown eyes.",

Which is very cut-and-dry and tangible example of how DNA effects our daily lives.\n\nUnfortunately, it's very boring. The other go to example is some snail shell's spiral direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) is dictated by some basic combination of alleles, but also not a great example. \n\nBeyond that you need to discuss gene regulation, like Operons and promoter/regulatory regions, upstream and down stream effects, and protein synthesis is critical part, not even touching post-translation modifications required for glycoproteins and such. \n\nCan you tell what I majored in college?",

But \u00af\\\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af \n\nThe reasons that blood has types is so your immue system knows what to look for and what not to attack. So blood types are a bad practical example since blood is used for more than transfusion, you have to talk about complimenting receptors to those blood proteins, and it's still not really tangible. So it's an ok idea and a decent jumping off point to explain something like fetus/mothers having incompatible immue systems, but I wouldn't use it with children and adults may have incorrect notions you don't want to fight so it's best to have a fresh example they won't know about.",

The most obvious example is your hands (hence handedness). They are similar but reflected: there is no way to rotate one such that you get the other. So too with the spiral. Many people have difficulty rotating a spiral in their head, but just consider looking at two spiral staircases side by side, where one is going clockwise and the other counterclockwise. They're distinct structures that cannot be rotated to match. If you flip a clockwise spiral, you will still have a clockwise spiral. But consider that there are two choices to orient the name of each spiral: by going up or going down. I think this is what confused you based on your question. On a spiral staircase on which you go counterclockwise going upstairs, you will go clockwise going downstairs; but there is also the other staircase on which you will go clockwise going upstairs and counterclockwise going downstairs. And they are distinct.",

In fact it seems to be uncommon.\n\nWe\u2019ve known since 2010 (Tarutani et al, *Nature*) that dominant alleles produce small RNAs which silence the recessive one(s), and since 2015 that this represents a large (90%+) proportion of observed gene silencing in monoallelic expression (ie, the classical Mendelian scenario).\n\n&gt;\tBasically - in the majority of cases, recessive traits are those that result from an allele which has a loss of function\n\nThis, specifically, is the incorrect part.\n\nThe overall topic here is the molecular basis for dominant/recessive expression, and the processes which actually produce dominance are gene silencing pathways, of which there are a variety and haploinsufficiency is only one.\n\nIt also seems that there is a consistent mechanism across genomes by which deleterious mutations are biased towards recessive expression patterns, though moderated by connectivity. The fact that silencing seems to be under selection precludes the notion of dominance arising purely from knockout of the recessive allele via mutation, since mutation is random in locus and incidence.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05281-7\n\nIf you wanted to base your comment around a \u201cbasic principle\u201d which covers the broad strokes, but like most things in biology is subject to specificities (which I think is reasonable) you should choose small RNA silencing as this general case. Haploinsufficiency is reasonable to describe the general case for recessive pathologies, but only in the mutations causing the disease. Those represent only a tiny amount of all dominant/recessive scenarios in the genome, and more so a tiny proportion of all genomes in the population. In other words, only a very small number of people have these recessive disorders, and that\u2019s only for one gene among the tens of thousands in their genome.",

You just cant pass it down to your kids.\n\nIt may be caused by *spandrels*, which is a complicated mess to pin down. Essentially less of a single gene than the outcome of a complex interaction between two or more genes.\n\nYou could, for example, have a gene or set of genes that causes a great deal of inconsistency between the production and uptake of pigmentation in your eyes. Such things could be practically invisible and undetectable if it were anything else- but in the case of pigmentation theres a visual marker.\n\nMost genes come with rather specific if-this-then-that conditions attatched to them, and so if you have a rare transcription factor, you might end up with erratic behavior where it produces pigment under some conditions but not in others- and you might get wildly different pigmentation in areas based on like, the width of veins and capilaties restricting or allowing the flow of certain amounts of proteins that signal pigment production.\n\nTheres all kinds of different ways it can happen.",

One is I guess brown pigment, one is for yellow pigment, and one is for making pigment. So you can have blue eyes either by having recessive genes for the brown and yellow pigment, or you could have the genes to make the brown pigment, but if you have the recessive genes for making pigment in general then you can have blue eyes. So there is more than one way to have blue eyes. \n\n\nYou can also have brown pigment, yellow pigment, and make pigment, and that would give hazel eyes. You could have no brown pigment, yellow pigment, and make pigment, and you'll have green eyes. \n\n\nSo a couple with brown eyes can produce offspring that has blue eyes by either passing along recessive genes for the eye color pigmentation, or by passing along recessive genes for the ability to make pigment at all. This is why eye color isn't a reliable way to determine biological parents. It could also be impossible for someone with brown eyes to have a blue eyed child, if both alleles are dominant for brown eyes and both alleles are dominant for making pigment, then the resulting offspring would always make brown pigment and have the ability to make pigment, ruling out the possibility for blue eyes. \n\n\nI think eye color is still more complex than this and there may be other genes that influence or control it, but I think this is the general example used when introducing this concept in classes.",

The *i* allele encodes a non-functional enzyme resulting in neither antigen. *I*^A and *I*^B are codominant and can be expressed together resulting in the AB blood type.

For example, why isnt an animal with one allele for albinism paler than normal?\n\nThe reason is that most genes have feedback mechanisms.  If a cell needs a certain protein it will keep making it until it has enough.  If it has 2 copies of an allele, it will make some from each.  If it has one copy, it wont make half as much, instead it will just keep making protein from the functional copy until it has enough.",

                    "comment": "Yeah, this is what I came to say. Most often a recessive is a code for a nonfunctional protein. So it's not like a gene codes for this protein or that other different protein. It's that either a gene codes for a functional protein or a nonfunctional protein.\n\nLactose intolerance is a good example. A functional gene codes for the production of lactase, the enzyme that breaks down lactose. The recessive is just a broken version of lactase that is malformed and nonfunctional. Your body still makes the protein, it just doesn't *do* anything.\n\nSo homozygous dominate is functional-functional. Heterozygous is functional-nonfunctional. Heterozygotes may have some mild symptoms but they have some functioning lactase and so are not intolerant. Only nonfunctional-nonfunctional (homozygous recessive) is totally lactose intolerant.\n\nBlue eyes are basically this. Most babies are born with blue or grey eyes because that's the color of your eyes before supplamental eye pigment is created. Blue eyes is basically a lack of functional code for additional eye pigment so you keep your \"baby\" eyes, aka \"baby blues\"!\n\nInterestingly, you might wonder why we aren't born with full eye pigment. Darker eye pigment is created to protect your eyes from the sun and it's creation is stimulated by your eyes being exposed to sunlight. Babies in the womb don't have eyes exposed to sunlight. Also, this means blue eyed people are lacking sun protection for their eyes, and the lighter your eyes are the more likely you are to be photosensitive (bothered by bright lights). Light eyed people should always wear sunglasses in bright light because sunlight can damage your eyes, literally you get sunburn on your eyes and over time this can permanently damage your vision.",

            "comment": "First, terminology: An allele is a variant of a particular gene.  You can have various alleles of a gene represented in a population, but only two alleles in a particular person.  One allele on one copy of a particular chromosome and either the same allele (homozygous is the term for this) on the other matching chromosome, or a different allele (heterozygous). \n\nWhether a gene is recessive or not has to do with the relationship between two different alleles of that gene.  A dominant allele is called such because it produces a product whose properties dominate over those of a recessive allele.  The amount of dominance can be complete (you can't tell if a person is carrying a recessive allele for that gene, just by looking at the product produced by the gene or by its effect on the body), or partial, which is obvious.  An example of partial would be hazel eye color, as opposed to brown when you are homozygous for the dominant gene or blue if you are homozygous for the recessive gene.  A gene being dominant or recessive is not inherently good or bad.  It depends on the gene.\n\nAs an example, say you have a gene that makes an enzyme that catalyzes a necessary chemical conversion in the body.  The enzyme 21-hydroxylase is a good example.  If you have two alleles that both make a well-functioning 21-hydroxylase enzyme (you are homozygous dominant), you are good.  If you are heterozygous for the gene, having one good copy and one bad copy, you are still good, as the good copy can make enough functioning enzyme.  The bad copy is recessive, in the sense that you never see its effects (even though it makes the bad enzyme), as long as the good copy (the dominant gene) is present.  But if you have two bad copies (homozygous for the recessive gene), you are in trouble.  Since there is actually more than one mutation that produces a bad 21-hydroxylase enzyme (i.e., multiple recessive alleles out in the population), then you can be somewhere in the middle, if you have two of those.\n\nThere are recessive genes that make plenty of whatever product it is they make, such as the recessive genes for different kinds of hemoglobin molecules.  Sickle cell disease and the thalassemias are good examples.  Sickle cell disease demonstrates an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern.\n\nColor in flowers can be another example.  A recessive allele may produce a pale color, or no color at all, or maybe something like yellow, and a dominant allele produces a brighter color.  Heterozygosity will mean that the dominant allele will produce its brighter pigment, with the result being a brighter color (results may vary), than if only the recessive allele were present.\n\nI hope this helps.  You might look up the work of Gregor Mendel.  He didn't know the mechanisms of genetic expression but focused on genetic traits (phenotypes) in plants.  That's really what dominant/recessive is about.",

But it turns out Notch is a signaling molecule involved in almost every developmental process.  There are several eye phenotypes that are recessive, like the strawberry eye color and faceted eye morphology. You have to have two utations to see those.

            "comment": "This is a definitional question - what do you mean evolve? If you mean \u2018change\u2019 then yes. If you mean something more narrow, it may not be the case. It also depends a little on what you mean by non-living things, but I think that is of secondary importance. \n\nFor example crystals don\u2019t have any Darwinian elements to them. The bigger crystals aren\u2019t evolving to eat smaller ones. Yes crystal change over time, but it\u2019s not really competitive. \n\nOn the other hand, businesses could be said to be Darwinian in that there is competition and they will consume, kill, waste away etc. \n\nYou could mean something even more narrow, which might also apply to the non-living thing of viruses.",

(Surfaces are essentially 2D defects of unsatisfied bonding relative to the bulk.) As a result, material tends to naturally diffuse from the smaller crystals, which ultimately vanish. \n\nSo the bigger crystals do end up \u201ceating\u201d the smaller crystals even though the materials are unquestionably inanimate.",

            "comment": "There is the concept of [mineral evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_evolution) and the co-evolution of a growing diversity of life and minerals. There are only a handful of minerals, identified in [pre-solar grains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presolar_grains), that existed prior to the formation of our Solar System (notwithstanding exoplanetary systems). The number increased to ~250 with the formation of Earth, asteroids, and other planets, then to ~1500 through early geologic processes such as volcanism and the beginnings of plate tectonics. The advent of life, and in particular the oxygen-rich atmosphere it eventually created, more than tripled the number of minerals on Earth. To sum it up, in the words of [Robert Hazen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hazen): \"The origin of life depends on minerals, but the origin of [many] minerals depends on life.\"",

            "comment": "There's a subfield of computer science called genetic programming. Genetic programming mimics evolution by randomly mutating bytecode programs or hybridizing two such programs to solve some problem. It's very effective when you can quickly evaluate via a fitness function how good a solution is when a closed form solution doesn't exist. I believe modern antenna design benefits a lot from this technique, but that's not what I work on.",

            "comment": "Behavior modification and learning in an individual organism is in many ways analogous, in that both are driven by selection pressure. \u201cAnimals do what works\u201d (even if the resulting behavior is counterproductive in other ways or not the most efficient way to go about something) and so does evolution (even if some of the structures that result are less than ideal). It really blows my mind sometimes how in many ways our entire world is a result of this process being applied at all levels in a fractal sort of way. Start with semi-random trial and error, apply some type of selection pressure, keep and amplify what seems to work best, discard what doesn\u2019t work. Our genes are the result of applying this process on a molecular level over millennia and we can learn new skills by applying the same process to our actions over a very short amount of time. A little more abstract than your crystal example, but fun to think about!",

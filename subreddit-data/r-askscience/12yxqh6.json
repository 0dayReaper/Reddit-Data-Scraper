The added bouyant mass to the fluid simply adds to all the forces the fluid exerts against the containment (floor/base primarily, but the sides of a container as well if there are vertical faces).",

                            "comment": "A pool completely supported by a giant scale (but rigid, like a standard aboveground pool) will always weigh 1,000 lbf more if you add a 1,000 lbf weight. The increased pressure on the vertical sides of the pool can only hold the water *in*, not *up*. If the sides aren't perfectly vertical, the sides do provide some support to the weight...but all the force they provide has to be channeled down onto the base, which is supported by the scale.\n\nThink about it this way: \n\nIf you have 100 mL of pure water at 20\u00b0C, it masses 99.8g and weighs about 979N. You put a flask on a scale and zero out the scale, then pour the water into it. You expect the scale to show an increase in weight of 979N (or a little less if not quite all the water wants to pour out), right? And this is true regardless of whether the flask is a weird art project or something with vertical sides.\n\nIf you put a solid 99.8g mass in the flask, again you expect the scale to show an increase in weight of 979N. \n\nSo why would it be any different if there already happens to be water in the flask when you add the weight?",

Ie if you have a 1000 lbs weight hanging from a spring scale as it is lowered into the water, the spring scale will read less than 1000 lbs because of the buoyant force of the water acting on the weight. In that scenario the full weight of the object wouldn\u2019t be read by the scale under the pool because it is being held up by the separate spring scale. The pool scale would however increase by the amount the spring scale decreased.",

I've got an object of known mass M, hang it by a scale in a liquid of known density and observe the remaining weight the string has to support, S.  S = density\\*volume\\*g-(liquid density)\\*volume\\*g = M\\*g - (liquid density)\\*volume\\*g so volume = (M-s/g)/(liquid density) and object density = Mass/volume = M\\*(liquid density)/(M-s/g).\n\nObviously the string causes problems, but if it's close enough in density to the liquid (some polymers), it'll be trivially small.",

            "comment": "A kind of nice neat and tidy way to think about this is that when an object that floats is added, the water level will rise.  That's because some of the object is below water level and the water that's displaced when that goes in has to go somewhere.\n\nThe pressure at the bottom of the pool is rho gh, where rho is the density of the water, g is gravity, and h is the height of the water level above the bottom of the pool.  \n\nThat equation holds whether there's an object floating in the pool or not.  So when you add a large floating object and you want to know how much the pressure on the bottom of the pool increased, you need only look at a ruler on the side of the pool that shows you how much the water level increased.",

            "comment": "The pressure exerted by a column of water depends only on the height of the column. Making the column wider only increases the total force, not the pressure. If you put something buoyant into a reservoir of water, the height of that reservoir is raised evenly by the amount of water displaced by the object. Therefore, the additional weight is also distributed equally over the ground of your reservoir.",

            "comment": "Ok, so, imagine you have an inflatable wading pool, which weighs 5 kg or \\~10 pounds by itself, filled with, just for fun, a whole cubic meter or 1000 kg or \\~2200 pounds of water. Let's say the whole pool is sitting on a giant scale.\n\nIf you put a 50 kg/110 lb person in the pool, no matter whether they float or sink, the scale is going to read 1005 kg or \\~2210 pounds before they get in, and 1055/2320 when they're in the water.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, let's say they float.\n\nThey'll displace some water (50 liters, oddly enough), and that will make the level rise in the pool. That will increase the pressure in all of the water, which will increase the force on every bit of surface area the water is in contact with below the surface.\n\nIf the pool is strong enough, the sides will deform some but the structure will still direct the sideways forces downward, just with more intense stress in the material of the inflated plastic. Same story if it was a free-standing solid material pool, or a pool in a hole in the ground, but the inflatable wading pool is easier to picture sitting by itself on top of a big scale.\n\nFun thought, though: if they sink, whatever part of them is resting on the pool bottom is exerting some normal force that, if they were a low enough density to float, would instead be dispersed over the whole pool.",

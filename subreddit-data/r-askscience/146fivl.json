                            "comment": "I want to add a note that nobody's actually covered in any of these answers. The reason it's so potent of an explosive is that the density of the explosive as a solid is many, many times higher than when those compounds react to become a gas. The explosive reaction is what converts these molecules to a gas, and once they're in gaseous form they undergo further entropy, wanting to move from an area of high pressure to an area of low pressure. The rate at which this reaction occurs in the explosive dictates just HOW explosive it is as well, this is why different explosives are used for different purposes (and why there's a distinction between high and low explosives, it's based on this reaction rate). For context, one gram of TNT produces 1 liter of gas. 1 liter of volume, for context, is the volume that 1000 grams of water takes up, so the expansion ratio for TNT is 1:1000. Now imagine a bomb with 500,000g (500kg) of TNT, which is a common bomb yield for air dropped warheads (it's the 1000lb bomb class for those unfamiliar with metric). That bomb almost immediately produces 500 million liters of gas in a space that only takes 500 liters of explosive. For context, an Olympic swimming pool is only 2.5 million liters. If I misplaced a decimal anywhere someone feel free to let me know, but I think I got it all right since I checked everything twice lol.\n\nTNT isn't as commonly used today as it used to be, but it's still a gold standard explosive that is used as the high explosive to which all others are compared in explosive yield, which is why I picked it to do the math with. Also its expansion ratio is a nice whole round number, so the math is easy lol",

            "comment": "The short answer is that Nitrogen has a strong energy incentive to be bound only to itself with a triple bond as N\u2261N - so any compound that contains nitrogen is generally going to be less stable than one that does not. \n\nThe reason that Nitrogen gas is so inert is because of the strength of the N\u2261N bond. It takes a large amount of energy to break this bond, and because its so easily reformed it takes very little energy for a compound to shed any Nitrogen by comparison.\n\nFor a particularly extreme example, have a look at Nitrogen Tri-Iodide, and generally any compound with an Azide group is also going to be hideously keen to detonate.\n\nEdit: For a particularly humorous introduction to 'energetic compound' chemistry, which almost always includes Nitrogen, have a read of Derek Lowe's 'Things I Won't Work With' blog: https://www.science.org/topic/blog-category/things-i-wont-work-with. I particularly recommend the one about Hexanitrohexaazaisowurtzitane (aka CL-20)",

There is a general rule of thumb (calculator online somewhere) that rates likelihood of explosivity against the percent of nitrogen atoms in your molecule. If you have a big organic molecule with one azide group chances are fairly low that it will ever detonate unless maybe you really force it to",

            "comment": "As the other comments mentioned diatomic nitrogen is an energetically very favorable state. \n\nAdditionally explosives make use of another property of nitrogen compounds.\nEvery proper explosive starts out as either a solid or liquid and decomposes into several particles of gas per particle of explosive. Now gas occupies a much higher volume per mol than solids or liquids (for example solid TNT has a molar volume of about 0,13 l/mol while an ideal gas has 22,4 l/mol) and this \"explosive\" volume change is one of the main causes of the pressure wave. Nitrogen compounds usually straight up completely decompose into diatomic nitrogen, while hydrogen and carbon compounds might go through subreactions first or even need atmospheric oxygen, reducing the net increase of gas molecules. Especially carbon compounds have a tendency to require atmospheric oxygen and do incomplete oxidations, resulting in soothe.\n\nSo nitrogenbonds are used in explosives both because  they store large amounts of energy and because they guarantee a net gain in gas molecules.",

Though since may of those are still gases that isn't really a problem for explosives. In Beirut there probably wasn't enough stuff for the large amount of excess oxygen to react to as the fertilizer was already a high oxygen content nitrogen-oxygen compound.",

When bonds are formed they create a release of energy. When triple bonds are formed they release a lot of energy. Therefore explosives that contain nitrogen will release a great deal of energy as the nitrogen atoms come together to create the diatomic N2 gas. Additional oxygen and carbon will also create H2O and CO2 that when the explosion takes place which also releases energy from the formation of their bonds.",

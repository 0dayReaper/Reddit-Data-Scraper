That\u2019s important for several reasons.People who are confirmed to be immune could venture from their homes  and help shore up the workforce until a vaccine becomes available, for  example. In particular, health care workers who are known to be immune  could continue to care for the severely ill.\n\nGrowing immunity in the community also is the way the epidemic ends:  With fewer and fewer people to infect, the coronavirus will lose its  toehold and even the most vulnerable citizens become more insulated from  the threat.\n\nImmunity may also bring an early treatment. Antibodies gathered from  the bodies of those who have recovered may be used to aid those  struggling with the illness caused by the coronavirus, called COVID-19.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of  plasma from recovered patients to treat some severe cases. A day  earlier, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that New York would become the  first state to begin testing serum from people who have recovered from  COVID-19 to treat those who are seriously ill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a trial for people who are in serious condition, but the New  York State Department of Health has been working on this with some of  New York\u2019s best health care agencies, and we think it shows promise,\u201d  Cuomo said.\n\nThe body\u2019s first line of defense against an infectious virus is an  antibody called immunoglobulin M, whose job is to stay vigilant in the  body and alert the rest of the immune system to intruders like viruses  and bacteria.\n\nDays into an infection, the immune system refines this antibody into a  second type, called immunoglobulin G, exquisitely designed to recognize  and neutralize a specific virus.\n\nThe refinement may take as long as a week; both the process and the  potency of the final antibodies can vary. Some people make powerful  neutralizing antibodies to an infection, while others mount a milder  response.\n\nThe antibodies generated in response to infection with some viruses \u2014  polio or measles, for example \u2014 bestow a lifetime of immunity. But  antibodies to the coronaviruses that cause the common cold persist for  just one to three years \u2014 and that may be true of their new cousin as  well.\n\nA study in macaques infected with the new coronavirus suggested that  once infected, the monkeys produce neutralizing antibodies and resist  further infection. But it is unclear how long the monkeys, or people  infected with the virus, will remain immune.\n\nMost people who became infected during the SARS epidemic \u2014 that virus  is a close cousin of the new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 had  long-term immunity lasting eight to 10 years, said Vineet D. Menachery, a  virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.\n\nThose who recovered from MERS, another coronavirus, saw much  shorter-term protection, Menachery said. People who have been infected  with the new coronavirus may have immunity lasting at least one to two  years, he added: \u201cBeyond that, we can\u2019t predict.\u201d\n\nStill, even if antibody protection were short-lasting and people  became reinfected, the second bout with the coronavirus would likely be  much milder than the first, said Florian Krammer, a microbiologist at  the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.\n\nEven after the body stops producing neutralizing antibodies, a subset  of immune memory cells can reactivate a response effectively, he noted.\n\n\u201cYou probably would make a good immune response before you even  become symptomatic again and might really blunt the course of the  disease,\u201d Krammer said.\n\nA crucial question is whether children and adults who have only mild  symptoms still generate a strong enough response to remain immune to the  virus until a vaccine is available.\n\nDr. Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam,  and her team have screened antibody responses in 15 infected patients  and health care workers.\n\nThe researchers are also using banked blood samples from about 100  people who were known to be infected with one of four coronaviruses  known to cause the common cold.\n\nIf those samples show some immune response to the new coronavirus,  too, Koopmans said, it might explain why some people \u2014 children, for  example \u2014 have only mild symptoms. They may have antibodies to related  coronaviruses that are at last somewhat effective against the new one.",

From what I recall: bats have a hyperactive immune system because they don\u2019t have much inflammation because it would affect their flight. So this coronavirus evolved to survive in bats, but when it infects us, our immune systems go into overdrive because they struggle a lot more. So it\u2019s the immune system response to the virus that ultimately kills people in this case.",

Personally I think the cooler thing is just how much of our immune system (and everything else) we inherited from our fishy ancestors.  In fact, who developed it first is moot, modern fish and humans inherited it from the same common ancestor around the same time we invented jaws.  So in fact \"we\" developed it at the same time as fish, because that's just who we were back then.\n\nA nerdy but fun read on the evolution of our immune system can be found here:  \n\nwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3805090\n\nOr for a layman friendly tale tracing our common ancestors back up the family tree try The Ancestor's Tale by Richard Dawkins and Yan Wong.",

When they encounter those again, they are more likely to avoid getting sick, compared to a child that has never been exposed to that same pathogen. \n\nSince this is an emerging pathogen, no adults had memory cells/antibodies ready to fight it, our immune systems have never seen it before.\n\nThe advantage a child has over an adult is a thymus that functions better. The thymus is where T cells mature. T cells don't make antibodies, but some types of T cells help turn on the cells that do and others can kill cells infected by viruses to stop the virus from replicating and spreading. \n\nAs you age, your thymus declines, and thus, you start to make less new T cells. With pathogens your immune system has already seen, you don't notice the difference because you already have memory T cells hanging around in case that pathogen reinfects you. A child that doesn't have as great of a repertoire of memory T cells will at least have the benefit of a more robust thymus pumping out tons of T cells. With a completely new pathogen, sometimes this can give children a slight advantage. The more T cells that are made, the better chance that the \"right ones\" will be produced to fight the current infection. However, there still is that element of chance, explaining why some kids are still getting pretty sick from this.",

Especially if they are given the time to recover and allow the memory cells to develop.\n\nDue to our extensive precautions already in place for health care workers (N95s, sterile procedure, hygiene, etc) the actual dosage they get is pretty minimal per exposure.  Lets say they get exposed, notably sick and head home for 14 days like is suggested.  They would develop memory and then go back to work.\n\nWhen they get back in, assuming hte virus doesn't evolve, the nurse will become exposed to the virus again.  In this contrived scenario her memory T cells would be armed and ready to combat the virus and clear it with very little symptoms and in about half the time.\n\nAll that said, under the conditions we have now due to abysmal political negligence, N95s are rare, nurses are working stupid hours and people are not being hygienic because the hospitals are inundated.  Under these conditions HCW wind up being exposed more frequently causing the virus to accumulate in their system.\n\nChronic exposure to the virus could actually lead to the exhaustion of cells that specialize in killing viruses (CD8 T cells) and stop performing their crucial functions.",

A person who's O- can donate whole blood to anyone because their red blood cells don't have any of the proteins that would cause a reaction in someone else's immune system.  However, their bodies make antibodies to all the proteins that could be on RBC.  A person who is AB+ wouldn't make any antibodies to any of the RBC proteins, so they could donate plasma to anyone.\n\n&gt;I.e. if someone has a disease that would ordinarily prevent them from donating blood, or other risk factors that would make a blood bank turn down their donation?\n\nSomeone who was anemic probably couldn't donate whole blood but shouldn't have a problem donating plasma.

The SARS type virus mutates slower than Flu, so it's less likely we need multiple types of vaccines to cover one class of virus.  \n\nIt may be similar to chickenpox, in that children have mild responses and get long term immunity while adults have much much worse responses.\n\nWe won't know more until we have time to study in labs and in reality.",

Interestingly enough they have found a viable virus in the air after 3 hours, so that's enough to be scared when people are sick around you. \n\nIt seems the virus generally has a shorter half-life and dries out and dies within a day. Even so, it just takes one virus to live for awhile to infect one person, and then have them spread it to 3 others.",

I believe the antibodies were insufficient to fight off the infection, but did cause a more severe reaction from the body (cytokine storm if I recall the term correctly?).  It may have been related to Dengue, but I can't find the article offhand.\n\nIn the event we see \"kinda good\" antibodies from those who recover, is it possible that if the SARS-COV-2 virus does become more persistent or seasonal that subsequent exposures could be more severe?  I'm not sure if this is likely or not, but if not too much of a pain was curious if there are any references or terms you may recommend to look into this type of response further.",

If you get one version of the virus and then at a later date get a mutation, the second infection should (theoretically) be easier for your body to fight off.

Same concept as the flu shot - even if the flu mutates and you get a new strain, the shot will help reduce the severity of illness. \n\nProbably doesn't help much as far as preventing spread, but if you're a high risk individual who survived one strain of corona, you're more likely to have an easier time fighting off a mutation.",

Flu is a really bad comparison for a couple of reasons...\n\n1) The coronvirus polymerase (which copies its genome for every round of infection) has a proofreading domain. So it makes fewer mistakes than the flu virus polymerase does. This means that the set of viruses that come out of an infected cell are less diverse than flu. This slows down the rate of evolution.\n\n2) The flu virus has a segmented genome that can get all jumbled up with another flu virus when they infect the same cell. This can cause massive changes and strains that humans would have no immunity for. This is called reassortment. It's what happened with the swine flu.",

But that is with the endemic coronavirus strains. We don't yet know how COVID-19 (SARS CoV-2) will affect immunity however, the first SARs coronavirus back in 2002-03 disappeared after a year or so suggesting a far more robust and lasting immunity and so the hope is that SARS CoV-2 will result in the same situation.",

Genetics aren't based on anything that simple.\n\nViruses are just as difficult to compare, but in different ways. Viral genomes are much, much smaller than mammal genomes and tend to not waste much space. Still, by necessity they have some \"junk\" (non-coding RNA) that sits outside the gene regions and those parts. Those parts of the RNA are frequently different between strains of virus families, but the changes are generally meaningless.\n\nIn the case of immunity, the only parts that matter are how similar the four structural genes are between SARS and SARS-CoV-2. Those structural genes code for the exterior proteins of the virus and are the parts that your immune system is able to look for. The other genes (not shockingly called \"non-structural genes\") don't really matter as your cells only see the proteins they make once a cell is invaded. \n\nSo, some percentage of similarity is only really important if its talking about how similar the structural genes are. There's less variation there between coronaviruses than that percentage really tells you.  It's still enough that a vaccine for one won't work for another one, but its not so much that you can't make some pretty accurate assumptions about how one will act based on what you observed of another one.",

If so, how long after you fight off the virus can you contract it again?**\n\n**Dr. Clark:**\u00a0This has a lot of people worried, so I\u2019ll go in depth below, but to\u00a0summarize:\u00a0there is no scientific evidence to suggest people can get re-infected within weeks of recovering. There is reason to believe protection\u00a0may\u00a0last at least a year.\u00a0\n\nMost experts think it is unlikely that most people can be re-infected in the short-term. It is more likely that the reports of reinfection are either rare events where the person did not produce an adequate antibody response, or a situation where that the person had not actually recovered and instead had a false negative.\n\nLike with other aspects of SARS-CoV-2, we look to other coronaviruses for clues. Coronaviruses that cause the common cold do not elicit a strong immune response, but the response generally lasts on a scale of years rather than weeks. Though in one study healthy volunteers were able to be infected twice with the same strain a year apart.8\u00a0A better comparison probably comes from\u00a0SARS because it causes a more severe disease. With SARS, people produced protective antibodies (that is, antibodies that protect against the virus) for up to two years after being infected, though the amounts of these antibodies decreased significantly after 16 months.9\u00a0Until we know more about COVID-19 specifically, this data is probably the best we have.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nSo, as of right now, we do not know how long this antibody response for SARS-CoV-2 lasts. But a recent pre-peer reviewed article showed that rhesus monkeys could not be immediately\u00a0reinfected\u00a0with SARS-CoV-2, which is good news and a\u00a0good\u00a0start.10\u00a0In the coming months we\u2019ll be able to answer this more clearly.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n 10.Bao, L.\u00a0*et al.*\u00a0Reinfection could not occur in SARS-CoV-2 infected rhesus macaques.\u00a0*bioRxiv*\u00a02020.03.13.990226 (2020) doi:10.1101/2020.03.13.990226.",

    "postText": "Particle entanglement is often described as spooky action at a distance.  Where two particles interact regardless of the physical distance between them.  Entanglement has also been described as a measurement of one particle that decides the properties of another because the interaction between them determines their shared properties that must be conserved.  However, can the entanglement include more particles, can this be expanded to a macroscopic level to observe things like additional dimensions or new physics?",

            "comment": "In principle you can entangle as many particles as you want. A prominent example is the [GHZ state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state). You can also get entanglement with effective particles like phonons where you could say the entanglement includes the whole object.\n\nThe more particles you include the harder it tends to get to preserve entanglement.\n\n&gt; Where two particles interact regardless of the physical distance between them.\n\nThey don't interact with each other.\n\n&gt; can this be expanded [...] to observe things like additional dimensions or new physics?\n\nNo.",

The state is a superposition of these two options \"all particles are in state 1\" and \"all particles are in state 0\" (for some systems that have these two options for each particle). It's pretty similar to the typical example of two entangled particles where you have one particle in one state and the other in the other, or both in the same state. Just with a third particle.",

They don't send information back and forth.  We don't know the mechanism for preserving the entanglement.\n\n&gt;Entanglement has also been described as a measurement of one particle that decides the properties of another because the interaction between them determines their shared properties that must be conserved.\n\nThis is closer because at the most fundamental level is when two particles are entangled, the shared state constraints between them are preserved until measurement of either or both (and possibly after).  But the measurement simultaneously collapses the state of both particles, potentially even when done to the original system state before the particles left it.  However, again, we don't know the underlying mechanism (is it non-local binding?  pilot waves?  collapse of probabilities?).\n\nThe wrong way to think about entanglement is a pair of particles that send info back and forth between them to make sure everything checks out - they share state, they don't exchange it.  This is why parallel worlds, pilot waves, etc. are theories about how the state is shared are more accurate because they attempt to preserve the state constraints globally.  Nothing about entanglement moves faster than the speed of light.\n\nAnd to answer your question, yes, entanglement does appear to be transitive to other particles under the right conditions, so you can chain state constraints.\n\nThis assumes that entanglement is correctly understood by experiment today, which is still not entirely clear, even though the physics community has settled on Copenhagen for the most part.",

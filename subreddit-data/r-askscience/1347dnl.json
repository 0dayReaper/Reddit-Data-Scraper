Since there is no well defined surface, you'd sink until you were a few hundred km below the photosphere, when your density would equal the plasma density so you'd be buoyant. At that point, you'd need to swim. Assuming survival in 6000 degree plasma is possible, an you can breath hydrogen, that is.",

Sol is the Latin name (and thus used in Romance languages).\n\nNote that Common Germanic *did* have the cognate *sowulo*, thus why Scandinavian languages also have *Sol*. Common Germanic had at least four words for \"the Sun\".",

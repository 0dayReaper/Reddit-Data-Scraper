            "comment": "Yes! There has been quite a bit of research showing that hydrating with drinks that contain salts and sugar help us better absorb and keep water. In brief, we need to replace salts lost via sweating, otherwise we won't retain the water we drink. Sugars and other sweeteners like glycerol have been found to help our gut absorb the water we drink even more. But you don't need to buy commercial sports drinks, you can also just make it at home or buy the cheaper store brands. \n\nA big caveat here is that this applies to people who are doing moderate to intense exercise or are spending time in a particularly hot environment and are sweating a lot. Hydrating throughout the day can and should be done with water. Using sports drinks to hydrate all the time instead of just during/after exercise often will cause us to consume excess calories and salt which can be harmful.\n\n**In more depth** \\- our bodies determine our fluid level by sensing the osmolality of our blood (eg the concentration of salts). When our blood is hypotonic, our body senses this as too much fluid and our kidneys work to get rid of it by diluting our urine. When our blood is hypertonic, our body senses this as too little fluid and our kidneys concentrate our urine to retain fluid. Our sweat is isotonic so if athletes rehydrated with water, they would be diluting their blood (hypotonic) resulting in their bodies not retaining it and instead peeing it out. In fact, marathon runners who only drink water can dilute their blood so much they are at risk for hyponatremia which can be really dangerous. \n\nRehydrating with iso- or hypertonic solutions replenishes salts and keeps our blood isotonic so our bodies retain that fluid. In fact, we can actually hyperhydrate by drinking sports drinks before exercise which can help athletes withstand water and salt loss for longer periods of time.\n\nAnother body of evidence for this effect of better hydration with salt and glucose comes from the field of heart disease. Consumption of salt results in our bodies retaining fluid. If this happens regularly without compensatory fluid loss (IE through exercise) then our bodies will be fluid overloaded. Too much fluid in a (relatively) closed system resulting in increased pressure (IE blood pressure). Chronically elevated blood pressure wears out the heart and eventually leads to congestive heart failure. The way people can reverse this effect is by consuming less salt so their bodies sense hypotonic blood and their kidneys remove fluid through their urine. One of the few medically proven healthy diets is called the DASH diet which reduces salt intake for people with high blood pressure. \n\nHydration and exercise (review) - [www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900704001029](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900704001029)\n\nHydration and exercise (study) - [www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900709001130](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900709001130)\n\nHyperhydration - [link.springer.com/article/10.2165/11530760-000000000-00000](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/11530760-000000000-00000)\n\nMedical oral rehydration solutions - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9464461/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9464461/)\n\nHeart disease and salt intake (including DASH diet) - www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002934311009491",

Sodium, magnesium, and potassium are all absolutely essential for the proper functioning of muscles.  Many minor muscle injuries, and things like cramps, twitches, weakness, and spasms, are often caused by a deficiency of one or more of these minerals.  These maladies will invariably result in deminished performance when they occur, and these are the very same minerals which are depleted by high-intensity exercise. \n\nSo yes, sports drinks do help to maintain performance during high-intensity exercise, especially in hot weather, better than an equal volume of water would without these additives.",

Sportsdrinks will work exactly the same way depending on if they are hypotonic, hypertonic or isotonic. Hypotonic fluids will hydrate the fastest because of the passive absorption caused by the difference in the amount of salts between your bodily fluids and the drink. Not all sportsdrinks are the same, though. There are many that are no different from soft drinks and thus hypertonic without being labelled as such, and will be absorbed slower.\n\nThe best sportsdrink for fast hydration are actually diarrhoea rehydration mixes.",

It definitely isn't \"superior to water\" for your normal dietary needs but it actually is better than water for sustained intense athletic activities. If you pushed yourself hard enough, long enough and kept drinking water you would eventually run out of salts and have a problem with hyponatremia. That is not the case with a properly designed sports drink. \n\nThey're definitely not as big of a deal as the marketing makes them out to be either though.

The sweat rate was nearly 0.5 kg/hour of water and can be higher than 1, and 0.5 g/hour of sodium (~ 1 g/hour NaCl). (Potassium loss due to sweat is about half as much as sodium, which is not mentioned explicitly in the study, but is very significant if you're not [replenishing your K](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/potassium/).) The study concludes that energy drinks like Gatorade replenish water and salt very effectively, but the sugar content is *way too high* for being used solely for that purpose for an all-day workday -- 8 hours of construction, mining, whatever, just doesn't burn the calories with the intensity of a couple hours of elite football -- therefore they recommend sparing if any use of such drinks and really good (possibly multiple) lunches. (They also measure that people acclimatize for salt loss in harsh environments over a week or so.)\n\nand to the question: energy drinks don't \"hydrate\" you better (water is water, and you need a certain amount, and if you're getting enough fluids and not too much salts (you can tolerate a surprising amount if healthy) you will absorb what you need from your intake regardless), but they do replenish electrolytes (in order of importance: Na &amp; Cl, K, Mg) which will be critical during prolonged exercise. Mind the sugar relative to the workout intensity, though.",

The salts and electrolytes cause your body you hold onto water while the alcohol tends to try and dehydrate you. The mixes are better than Gatorade or Powerade because you can mix them up far stronger. Sometimes I use a bottle of Gatorade as a base and add extra hydration mix to it. This has not only nearly eliminated hangovers for me (though I don't drink all that much these days) but it has also stopped me from getting migraines due to dehydration while working outside when it's hot. Often I could not physically drink enough water to keep myself hydrated before discovering those mixes. Literally life changing.",

I would explicitly define a food as healthy as any substance that sustains the bodies basic metabolism with no innately harmful effects. So that excludes alcohol. Sugar is healthy, our brains evolved on it and Omaga 3s. But we absorb more sugar that crosses our BB barrier and is used by our brain then we realize. So eating excessive sugary foods only stresses out your pancreas, liver and heart. Meat is healthy, it provides essential protein and vitamins and minerals. But excessive intake of red meat with saturated fat, especially processed red meat products, correlates with HTN and Cardiac disease. FRUCTOSE Corn syrup is innately less healthy than CANE sugar because it is a more simple sugar molecule, therefore it's \"glycemic index\" for diabetics is higher (more likely to contribute to higher blood sugar levels). So \"healthy\" is not so much arbitrary as it is contextual/personal. It depends. What's healthy for you may not be for someone else based on their health history. Doesn't make the food item in question less healthy overall, just some peoples unique health conditions may not allow its consumption.",

If you work outside in the heat and do physical work, I highly recommend at least trying Pedialyte, Gatorlyte or other sugar free/low sugar rehydration drinks. I was quite skeptical until I tried it myself, although it could be a placebo effect. Whatever it is, it works for me :)",

It won't hurt you, but it's extra sugar and electrolytes is just unnecessary unless you are legit sweating, highly active, etc. The purpose of these drinks is not only to allow the water content to be absorbed faster, but to replace the electrolytes you may be losing through sweat, urine, etc.  \nThat's why they hydrate you \" better\". I would say an objective definition of better in regards to the term hydration is \"faster, with electrolyte replacement\".",

I will never go back to Powerade because of what they did.  \n50% MORE ELECTROLYTES was their excuse to skimp on whatever they did to the taste.",

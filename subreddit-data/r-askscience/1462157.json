            "comment": "These answers are kind of wild.\n\nOk so I'm a dentist and I'll give my 2 cents.\n\nSo first of all, the nerves that tell you that you are biting are not IN the tooth, but *around* the tooth -- specifically in the periodontal ligament.  This is a thin layer of tissue that stretches, and that stretching or compression tell your brain what you are chewing is either soft or hard. If I put a blindfold on you and put something in your mouth like a potato chip and you bite down, you know immediately that it's crispy and you adjust your force accordingly.   A denture does not give this feedback.  There are lots of studies to show that chewing with dentures is decidedly worse than real teeth, and this is a principle reason.\n\nOk so the chewing and feedback is from around the tooth -- the connection between the tooth and the jawbone.  What about the nerves *INSIDE* the teeth?  Why do you feel pain there?\n\nTeeth are *alive*. They feel temperature. There is blood inside the tooth.  The tooth *lays down more dentin throughout our lives*, making the dentin layer thicker and the pulp layer thinner.  The reason it's there in the first place is because that's how your tooth was made.\n\nI'm simplifyung things, but have two types of hard tissue-making cells for your tooth.  The first at ameloblasts, the second are odontoblasts.  They are buddies until the start growing your tooth.  The former grows OUT, and the later grows IN, and KEEPS GROWING IN until the tooth dies or there is essentially no pulp left.\n\nNote: if your pulp gets SUPER thin, you can't feel temperature anymore.\n\nSo why do you feel pain inside?  Because it's messing with the tooth trying to make more dentin -- something is messing up the process.  Bacteria, trauma, etc.  Bacteria make abscesses in teeth, and that hurts.  Putting pressure on that tooth will injure it more.  Teeth are special in that it won't get better on its own, mostly because the blood supply inside the tooth sucks, so your immune response sucks.",

                    "comment": "There is a rather dated paper (1971) by Dr. Otto Schaeffer, documenting the changes in Canadian Eskimos with the advent of the modern diet, entitled \"When the Eskimo Comes to Town\". Most of the paper concerns how Western dietary habits (lots of sugary foods) is bad: the Hudson's Bay Company is implicated, causing the populations to have traditional foods high in fat and protein replaced by chocolates and Coca Cola with predictable dental results.\n\nIn these populations, the teeth have been used for generations as tools, to chew sealskin to soften it in lieu of chemical tanning methods. In many instances, the teeth have been worn down nearly to the gumline; see also [Pedersen's paper](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/003591574704001216) from 1947:\n\n&gt;The general attrition of the teeth is severe during maturity and in the old\nEskimo-male as well as female-the teeth are often worn down to the gums. In\nfemales the chewing of hides accounts for part of the wear. On the whole, however, the bearing of this kind of work upon the attrition of Eskimo teeth has been over-emphasized since the male Eskimo. who does not chew hides, also shows exceedingly pronounced wear of his teeth.\n\n&gt;Exposure of the pulp due to attrition is comparatively rare. In most cases\nabundant formation of secondary dentine protects the pulp cavity from being opened.\n\n&gt;Multiple small fractures of the teeth are seen in almost all adult Eskimos living in primitive areas. Extensive fractures exposing the pulp are rather frequent.\n\nPerhaps predictably, in the near-absence of dietary sugars, there are few caries to be found:\n\n&gt;We do not know of any case of caries in Eskimo skulls dating with certainty before contact with white people.\n\nDespite the extensive wear, these native peoples did not seem to suffer from oral pain.\n\nI suppose my question would be this: for indigenous populations that grind their teeth down, what is happening? \"Secondary dentine\" is said to be responsible by Pedersen; my rough reading from Google is that it's a secondary deposit once the tooth has formed, and that it is \"dentin deposited in the pulp chamber after the formation of primary dentin has been completed.\"\n\nSo- literally tooth material deposited *inside* the tooth as a response to this kind of wear, preventing pain?",

Teeth suck at fixing themselves, but they still do it to some extent. If you have an infection it might create a layer of puss and ooze that loosens the tooth in its socket and if you just kept ripping into meat with it it might pull it out. But if you favor that side of your mouth for a few days or weeks you can fight off the infection, the puss dries up, the tissue regrows, and the tooth is set firmly in place again. Or if you crack a tooth, it may need many months or even years to regrow enough dentin to be solid enough to go back to chewing meat. But you can still use it to chew apples or berries or something, which is why you only notice pain if you bite too hard on something.\n\nIt's also a mechanism for avoiding injuries altogether. You start to feel pain long before you reach a level of stress on whatever tissue it is that will cause injury. For your teeth, if you try to bite a rock in half or something, you're going to feel pain that makes you avoid putting more force into it long before your tooth shatters. This is a great evolutionary trait because we eat things that have hard stuff inside them. Like bones in animals, or pits and seeds in fruit. We try to get those out visually, and by feel with our tongue, but if we miss one and chomp down on it, we want it to hurt before our tooth breaks.\n\nEdit: typos",

It's to keep you from using it so you have time to heal.\n\nBroken bones are catastrophic injuries. They were death sentences unless you had someone else to care for you. \n\nWhen you break a bone any movement at all could cause further injury, possibly even leading to bleeding out and dying within a matter of minutes where you would survive and heal if you had remained still for the weeks and months it takes the bone to knit.\n\nSo you feel that excruciating pain because you quite literally need to stay completely still for a long time for bone to start to knit and because moving can easily cause the bone to slice and tear muscle,or worse, sever veins and arteries or puncture organs.",

So where is this supposed evolutionary pressure is coming from?\n\nThe excruciating pain you have from breaking a bone is most likely to do with the fact that the entire system that causes pain can't just be shut off that easily even when an injury is so severe that the pain becomes kind of pointless (and it can't be shut off because we didn't evolve to shut it off, because there is no reproductive advantage to doing so).",

Again, this needs to lead to enough of a reproductive advantage to actually change the gene frequency within the entire population. The situation of having a catastrophic bone breakage and then being nursed back to health by your group is not common enough to have an evolutionary impact.\n\nAlso, *all* mammals feel excruciating pain with a broken bone, not just the social ones, meaning that that pain response evolved a long, long time ago, likely well before there were social mammals.\n\nPeople really seem to get this the wrong way around with evolution. There is an evolutionary advantage to feeling pain, because you know there is damage and can take care of it to some extent. That's why you feel pain where there are nerves.\n\nTo have that pain *not* be there in certain situations where it isn't useful, such as catastrophic injuries that you cannot recover from, there would need to be an evolutionary advantage to getting rid of the pain. There's not. Hence why we feel it sometimes when there's literally no point to it.",

So don't bite on it so it hopefully heals. This is the general reason for all pain as far as we know -- stop doing that thing that makes pain.  (There are exceptions like headaches, but still).\n\nHowever, pain due to something within the tooth, like bacteria, is not an advantage at all in my opinion.  But the fact remains you have acute nerves for temperature sensation perceived as pain in teeth.  Not everything has an evolutionary advantage -- it's a trade off.  Within the tooth you can either have temperature sensations or no pain.  In fact, a classic sign that a tooth is infected is \"hey, so i was having pain pretty badly to anything cold, and then it suddenly stopped, so I don't know whats going on.\" The internal tooth nerves died.\n\nApparently temperature won.",

Further analysis showed there were regions with the right amount of naturally-occurring fluoride in the water, been a few years since I studied this in geochemistry but I believe it was certain parts of Arkansas and maybe Alabama? My memory is rusty, and Google isn't helping. Some areas have *too* much, and it makes the tooth brittle- also \"skeletal fluorosis,\" which is pretty unpleasant. Somewhere around 1-2 parts per million in drinking water seems to do a pretty good job at slipping into that calcium phosphate matrix that comprises our teeth, and making that lattice stronger. Too much, not so much: it's kind of like alloying steel or aluminum, the concentration of certain trace metals can make all the difference in the finished product.\n\nBones are a *little* different in that they contain a surprising amount of protein- 1/2 its volume, 1/3 by mass. Teeth contain less, about 5% of enamel, according to a quick Google search. But it could mean that you have stronger bones.\n\nAnyway- my guess would be that you got just the right amount of fluoride while growing up. Congrats!",

I'm honestly not even sure what \"hardest teeth\" means really, because we're all made of the same stuff -- hydroxyapetite.  It's like 99% of enamel.  For comparison, most of your long bones are around 80%.  It could mean 1) you don't get cavities, so in layman's terms \"you have really hard teeth\" 2)you chew ice all day and I can't believe you haven't broken any teeth yet -- you have the hardest teeth that I know of 3)???  You get what I'm saying?\n\nThe *vast* majority of people who say they have soft teeth don't really have \"soft\" teeth.  They are the opposite of what I say above like 1) they get a lot of cavities because their diet and/or microflora are more likely to dissolve teeth or 2)  they chew ice and their teeth break because they chew at different angles, chew thicker ice, etc.\n\nThere *are* some conditions that do make your teeth actually softer, but they are *very apparent* when looking at the teeth.  Google amelogenesis imperfecta to see what I'm talking about.\n\nIt's like saying one diamond is harder than another diamond. Who knows man.",

For example there are blood vessels supplying blood to nerves and there are vascular nerves that innervate blood vessels. They contain both motor and sensory neurons. The motor neurons control vasodilation and vasoconstriction (the widening and narrowing of the blood vessel, respectively) and the sensory nerves are attached to baroreceptors which detect pressure on the vessel wall. Baroreceptors are only in a few places, though, like the aortic arch, and I believe the corrotid artery, though I'd have to look that one up.",

            "comment": "To the specific question of \"evolutionary advantage\": you should know that the pan-adaptationist view, that all traits are adaptations, is very outdated. Not everything is an adaptation. Plenty of traits are \"spandrels\", or structural evolutionary changes that are just byproducts, as well as genetic drift (traits that come along for the ride becasue they're neutral), as well as exaptations, traits that were adaptations for one thing but become useful for something else when environment changes, which means the trait was *not* selected for because of the new use, but an old, prior use. Etc., there are many other examples.\n\nThe point being, stop thinking in terms of everything needing to have an \"evolutionary advantage\" or adaptationist explanation.",

An untreated cavity will eventually (over years) kill you due to the infection inside the tooth spreading to your gums and body.  Without modern dentistry, only the humans who were driven by pain to pull infected teeth out of their mouth survived into old age",

            "comment": "I think there is a big misunderstand on how evolution works. Evolution doesn't favor the best/strongest/fastest/etc it it doesn't favor anythingbits a concept to describe species propagating traits because those are the ones that survived long enough to mate.\n\nSo teeth causing pain, if it didn't hinder the creature from propagating, would have no effect from an evolutionary perspective. It's why we have things called \"evolutionary shadows\" like cancer. Things that occur after a species reproductive peak are often not bread out because they occur after the species has propagated. Teeth pain could be one of these shadows, only affecting a species after it has reproduced, functionally not having any evolutionary impact.",

            "comment": "Shouldn't this discussion start with the more general question of the evolutionary advantage of pain. Clearly we have specifically developed a nervous system that can feel pain. But we don't have a specific nervous system for pain in all parts of the body. If you hold your breath it will eventually become too painful to continue holding your breath and you will be forced to breathe. But there's no nervous system that creates pain if your heart stops beating. But then you cannot consciously stop your heart beating, while you can stop your breathing.\n\nWhile it is true that the pain of an injured leg stops you putting pressure on the leg, the autonomic system could simply stop your leg working when there was damage. Pain seems to be instrumental in allowing the conscious system to control some part of the body but not to the extent that it harms the body's survival. You can hold your breath when you need to avoid detection by a predator but you can't hold your breath so long that you die of asphyxiation. You feel pain in your leg which tells you to look after the leg but it doesn't prevent you using the leg if you need to run away from a predator. \n\nThe evolutionary value of pain seems to be to allow a limited conscious action instead of immediately forcing a mindless autonomic action.\n\nBut I don't know if that applies to tooth pain.",

If it hurts so much that I yank that sucker out now I don't have a nexus of infection (or painl; yay!) in my face and instead I have admittedly a huge gaping wound but the mouth is sooo good at closing wounds pretty quickly. I sure the local elder medicinal person even has something to aid the process. Now that that whole experience is over I am fine to go on and rear my offspring, good thing my tooth hurt way back when.",

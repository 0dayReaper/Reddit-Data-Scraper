            "comment": "As long as an object is either emitting its own light (e.g. stars) or reflecting starlight (e.g. planets, moons, comets, gas clouds) then we can analyze that light and look for spectral lines. These are lines in the spectrum that show what elements are absorbing or reflecting light. They are like unique fingerprints that tell us exactly what an object is made of. \n\nAll the planets in our solar system came from a single vast cloud of dust and gas that collapsed under its own gravity to form a spinning protostellar disc. Eventually, the core of this disc became our sun and the disc of dust and gas surrounding it clumped together under gravity and became the different planets, moons, asteroids that we see today.  They are roughly in a flat plane because that original disc was flattened out as it spun - a bit like a pizza maker spinning a ball of dough to make a flat disc. Hope that helps.",

We can then determine the density by measuring the planet's size against that known mass.\n\nGravity affects spacetime in a way that can over-simplistically be compared to the slanted curves around a racecar track.\n\nGravitational lensing has been verified by observation of the light passing near our star, during a total solar eclipse.",

When you set the gravity equation equal to the acceleration equation, the mass of the object orbiting cancels out. \n\nIf the object is big enough compared to the star, you can measure the wobble in the stars position (or wobble in other planets orbits), but you can't tell the mass of an object based on its own motion.",

The star also reacts to the mass of the planet, so overall the orbit depends on both masses. That method is much less precise than using the moons of the planets, of course.",

Gas giants are more massive than earth, so they have more gravity and can hold onto a thicker atmosphere.\n\n3. In a simple 2 body system, like the sun and 1 planet, the planet will stay in a circular or elliptical orbit. If 2 planets were to get close enough together, they could interfere with each other's orbits. In our solar system, all of the inner planets are in roughly circular orbits, and far enough apart to not affect each other much.",

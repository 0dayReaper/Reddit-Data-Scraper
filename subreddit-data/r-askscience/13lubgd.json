    "postText": "It's a question I came up with as I was listening to a talk about transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (which I know is very controversial/maybe not true). \n\nI learned in a biology class that cell fate is determined in the embryo and highly regulated by epigenetics. Don't we have all a similar amount of each cell type? How does the body determine which cell becomes what and assuming it's all the same epigenetic marks, wouldn't that be a case of inheritance?",

            "comment": "Epigenetic marks are chemical modifications to DNA or histones. They are written or erased by enzymes that recognize particular DNA sequences, or the presence of other epigenetic marks.\n\nMarks such as DNA methylation can be inherited from mother cell to daughter cell when cells divide. However, in mammals, the marks are extensively erased in primordial germ cells, the precursors to eggs and sperm. Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals is  quite controversial. In my opinion, there may be a few extreme cases where it can happen, but it is quite overhyped. In other organisms (worms, plants, etc) this erasure doesn't happen and transgenerational epigenetic inheritance definitely exists.\n\nEpigenetics is a quite complicated topic, and if you'd like to learn more, I've written about it here: https://denovo.substack.com/p/what-is-epigenetics\n\nNow, cell fate is more than just epigenetics. Different cells express different RNAs and proteins, and this is regulated by things like transcription factors. \"How the body determines which cell becomes what\" is basically the entire field of developmental biology. I would suggest taking a look at a developmental biology textbook if you want to know more.",

I didn't realize that was what developmental biology was about. \n\nI assume then that the RNAs and proteins that are expressed are encoded in the genes which are inherited? Not sure if this is a naive question but if epigenetic marks aren't inherited, does that mean that those proteins determine the cell and the epigenetic layer I'd just an \"extra\"? Is the epigenetic profile of e.g. liver cells different in different individuals even if they are all expressed as liver cells?",

That's because they, in effect, *are* the cell, which is a lipid sac with a bunch of proteins in, on, and around it.\n\nThe genome provides the instructions for making proteins, and epigenetic markers are one way that the precise mixture of proteins and their relative abundances are determined - this is called regulation of gene expression. Epigenetic regulation is not fundamentally different from other forms of gene expression regulation, but epigenetics has its own named field of study because epigenetic markers are relatively long-lasting, potentially persisting over an organism's entire life and therefore having significant impacts on long-term development.\n\nTo answer more concisely, the epigenetic layer in part *gives rise to* the protein layer. Epigenetic markers turn gene expression on and off, and gene expression is (for the most part) protein production.",

            "comment": "Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is neither controversial nor untrue. It's just very new, and very poorly studied. Kerri Ressler's seminal paper about transgenerational inheritance opened a lot of doors.\n\nIn general, placement of epigenetic and all sorts of DNA modifications generally depend on activity. Heavily 'used' genes are also naturally more accessible in the chromatin and would accumulate modifications.\n\nCell fate determination is a different can of worms altogether. It depends a lot where the cell is located. Female gametes are usually radially symmetrical. Fertilization is usually the 'symmetry-breaking' event. The site of contact with sperm determines developmental axes. Cell fates are then usually decided based on location; decisions being governed by signalling gradients.\n\nI hope that answers your question.",

Thinking on this I am curious if he looked at the resultant dna for any epigenetic changes due to the electrical system.",

    "postText": "**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change. \n\nWhen 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.\n\nWhen black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.\n\nThese disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. \n\nChange requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. \n\nHowever, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.\n\nThese numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.\n\nThis lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.\n\nIt is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change. \n\n-----\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793\n- https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/\n- https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/racial-disparities-time-of-covid-19\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK24693/\n- https://www.joincampaignzero.org/research\n- https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/black-workers-coronavirus-covid-19\n- https://www.npr.org/transcripts/867466515\n- https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/diversity-in-the-stem-workforce-varies-widely-across-jobs/\n- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0519-z\n- https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.3.20190529a/full/\n- https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/09/11/even-progressive-academics-can-be-racist-ive-experienced-it-firsthand/\n- http://www.bu.edu/articles/2017/lgbt-issues-stem-diversity/",

Why is there still a large discrepancy in poverty levels in the different races and ethnicities in the US? Why does poverty lead to crime in such a large degree? If reducing poverty reduces crime rates and police homicides, can we decrease the poverty level without dragging the rest of the nation down?",

                    "comment": "&gt; Why is there still a large discrepancy in poverty levels in the different races and ethnicities in the US? \n\nIntergenerational wealth is a huge factor. There have historically (up until very recently) been huge barriers to (particularly but not only) black Americans building wealth.\n\nThere is a lot you can dive into in this area going all the way back to slavery. Or the [successful terror campaigns of the Klan during reconstruction](https://newrepublic.com/article/153772/racial-terror-failed-promise-reconstruction-trump-america) preventing black representation in their home states. Or the deliberate destruction of successful black communities in events like the [Tulsa race massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsa_race_massacre) (historically, [race riots in the US have been white communities attacking local minorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_racial_violence_in_the_United_States)).\n\nBut I'd start in the last century with [redlining](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/24/upshot/how-redlinings-racist-effects-lasted-for-decades.html) and the [modern legacy of housing discrimination](https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/12/4/20953282/racism-housing-discrimination-keeanga-yamahtta-taylor).\n\nIn a short version, the way mortgages were made available through a mix of federal and local policy meant that it was far harder to buy homes or invest in new developments in minority or \"racially inharmonious\" areas. Mixed use areas (such as in city centres) were also disadvantaged for investment. This was further exacerbated by explicitly segregated suburbs that drew yet more investment away from city centres while trapping the minority residents.\n\nThe first line from that second article;\n\n&gt;As of 2016, the median wealth for black families in America was $17,600, while the median wealth for white families was $171,000.\n\nThat lack of wealth limits everything else. You can't afford to do most of the stuff others might do to guarantee a higher income in the future.\n\nNow you layer on top of that the [various effects of living in a poor neighbourhood.](https://www.vox.com/2016/6/6/11852640/cartoon-poor-neighborhoods) Taking someone out and giving them access to a wealthier neighbourhood directly improves outcomes, even if there are no other changes to their situation.\n\nNotice that that article starts with the redlining problem as well. The mix of official and de-facto segregation reinforces the environmental gap that layers inequity upon inequity for the next generation. One generation being poor and trapped in a poor neighbourhood reduces the chances of the next being able to escape.\n\nAll of these factors are theoretically race blind. You might see similar issues in extremely poor white areas and individual poor white families are going to experience similar barriers from a wealth perspective, albeit with very different social and physical geography that are going to complicated the comparisons. But the history of the US means the particular mix of factors disproportionately impact black people and communities.\n\nThen there are the explicit racial factors that emerge from social perceptions of black people and act as further barriers to escape. Things like [unconscious bias against black people in hiring](https://www.pnas.org/content/114/41/10870.full) making it harder for them to find employment compared to equally qualified white people. Or people perceiving the same traits as [negative in black men and positively in white men](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2711), leading to potentially worse outcomes in similar encounters. When those encounters are with police officers those negative outcomes can be devastating, if not fatal.\n\nThis has sprawled a bit now so I'll stop there.",

If I snapped my fingers and eliminated all racism in law enforcement, we'd still have a ton of innocent people being killed every day, just perhaps in more equal numbers. Because the police in many places are essentially paramilitary forces that operate mostly above the law.\n\nHowever, if I snapped my fingers and eliminated police brutality, those lives would be saved. Yes, we still need to resolve the racial bias because certain populations would still be subjected to unfair policing, but if we're trying to save lives, then it's the abuse of power and corruption that we need to get rid of first.\n\nEdit: Multiple people have pointed out that many of these abuses probably wouldn't exist if they had predominantly affected whites, and that's very likely. However that cat is out of the bag, the abuses have been accepted and allowed. I look at the protests that focus on race and I wonder... If the police departments sat down and literally said, \"we will do anything you want that is physically possible to fix the race problem\". What would they ask for? Sensitivity training? Racial guidelines? Stricter hiring practices?  A plethora of these already exist. There are no practical solutions to the racial bias problem that can just be all of sudden implemented. That's a years long transition of all of society, one that we should begin, but that won't save lives for years to come.\n\nBut what we *can do* all of a sudden is... 1. Force them to wear body cameras, and make turning them off a criminal offense. 2. Eliminate no knock warrants. 3. Create an independent body to investigate abuse. These things focus on the root cause.\n\nEdit: I've realized that there may be another philosophical side to this argument. My argument rests on the principle that a human life is de facto the highest priority. I haven't even attempted to compare it to the unfair policing, which in some cases might be seen as torture, of millions of Americans. So which is worse? The loss of a few hundred lives, or the potential torture of millions? It's not a philosophical question that I'm qualified to answer because I can't actually speak to the subjective effect of being black in America. I don't really think it changes the fact that that problem can't be solved nearly as quickly as the others, but I at least want to acknowledge that my argument comes from a place where I don't even have to compare against living black, because I'm not.",

Responsibility and being incarcerated for crimes (like the military federal court UMCJ) 2. MORE training like Deescalation training, less than lethal weapon training, unarmed \"aggressor\" training, melee armed \"aggressor\" training, and \"gun aggressor\" training.\n(Lack of training: https://www.apmreports.org/story/2017/05/05/police-de-escalation-training)\n\nThat way they are equipped to handle all situations better and all deaths will be reduced. \n\nBecause what happens is an untrained and racist cop doesn't know what the right response is, become afraid, and then people die. And you can ask them, and they say well he was X so i did Y. I did what i could. What was i supposed to do?\n\nBut now, if a cop is trained and racist, it is much more clear they are racist. Because they won't have any excuse. Why did you disobey your training? He did X and I did Y, but the manual says Z. Oh i did what i could. Well that wasnt what you were supposed to do. Also, if they systemically act differently in their responses, then a clear case of bias is present and they can be re-trained or fired.\n\nThis also makes it much easier to enforce the law on police officers. Right now the spectrum of what is an allowed practice is quite large. But what if in their training there are legal parameters, that if they dont obey, they get fired. Even if what they did was not illegal (like escalate a nonviolent situation into a violent one), they can still be held accountable.\n\nEdit: a few words, but also what I said has now came true! \n/u/T1germeister is an aggressive person who isn't being conductive to what is trying to get done. Baby steps are needed.\n\nMichigan has now passed senate bill NO. 945 - mandating training such as de-escalation and bias realization. If they fail to do these things, they don't get their license or have it revoked. If they violate these things, then they get fired. Woah? Guess what, being fired means you no longer have the authority to do injustice. Yes, authority should never allow you to injustice. I think they should be fired and encarcerated. At the moment, they are getting neither. So just having them be fired and their license revoked is a big step.\n\nSource: http://www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2019-2020/billintroduced/Senate/pdf/2020-SIB-0945.pdf\n\nScroll to the bottom for the most relevant stuff.

            "comment": "Regarding the women and minorities STEM, the claim that they have low numbers is manufactured, dishonest, and borderline scientific fraud.  \n\nFirst off STEM is a vague definition, which allows those making this claim to basically manufacture the data to agree with them.  What counts as a STEM field?  Well there is not agreed upon and unambiguous definition. Usually, medicine, psychology, social science/anthropology, and sometimes even biology are omitted from the category (yeah I've seen a number of so called studies or talks on STEM demographics that didn't include biology).  Why?  All of these fields are doing some sort of scientific research. Ok maybe social science and anthro can by omitted as they are soft sciences, and not all anthropologist are actually scientist (but many are), but then why keep computer science?  But medicine, psychology (which is a medical and a scientific research field), and definitely biology all fully qualify as science.  By the way, those 4 fields are the 4 largest STEM fields by population and are all majority women.  So no surprise if you exclude them, then you're left with a lot of men.  Essentially, STEM is being defined as fields with few women, in order to prove there are few women in STEM.  Of course the non STEM fields have far more women than men, and the gender imbalance is even larger as universities as a whole have mostly female students and no one complains about that.\n\nAs far as the minorities claim, again it's based on vague a subjective ethnic categories (that really only make sense to an American).  It's true there are few black students, but they aren't the only minority category.  There are a lot of Chinese, Japanese, Taiwanese, Indians, and Jews in STEM.  All of which are minorities in the US.  But except for Jews, they all get lumped together as \"Asians\".  And so it appears as if there is little diversity.  But these cultures are very different from one another, and would never group themselves together.  Indian culture for example, has far more in common with western European culture than with Chinese and Japanese.  Grouping them all as Asians, demonstrates your ignorance and American ethnocentrism.  There are also a lot of Europeans from various countries, but they all get lumped together as white with white Americans, even though they all come from different cultures too, again, demonstrating that the category is centered around American perception.",

It's no secret that within the US, the Latino and Black communities tend to be among the most impoverished with the lowest high school graduation rates, worst test scores and lowest that go on to higher education. How do you break that cycle that has middle and high school aged kids spend the time to take their studies serious and want to graduate and go on for further education?\n\nCompare that to your suburban areas that are primarily white, Asian and Indian, most kids do graduate high school and a decent percentage do go on to 4+ year degrees. \n\nAs far as looking at those percentages, 29.7% of native born white citizens go on to earn a Bachelor's versus 16.3% of the black population (both of which pale in comparison to the 48.3% that the Asian population has). \n\nYour stats of 11% of the workforce is made up of the black population whereas only 7% of STEM jobs are held -- that actually falls in line with the disparity of the degree earning differences. \n\nMaybe the answer isn't forcing more diversity out of the current adult population, but to work on getting those kids who are in poor schools to prioritize their education and future and have a community that surrounds them to better support and encourage them.",

The count based on degree means it can be used in evaluating some other topics, such as degree choice and access to higher education, and in most STEM fields, IT excluded, a degree is more or less required for any mid to high paying job, and so can reflect degrees of the economic inequality faced by many BaME workers. I suppose a similar metric of those in STEM with pay above a certain level might be equally useful.\n\nBut obviously overall count of BaME people in STEM regardless of formal education or economic standing has its own value for some enquiries, and as you say, would include a wider range of workers.\n\nEdit: just to clarify for anyone who has not encountered the phrase BaME, it stands for Black and Minority Ethnic",

The black population in the united states is roughly 45 million. If we assume half of those are male and we're seeing roughly 240 black deaths by police per year, how do you arrive at 1 of every 1000 is likely to die from a police interaction? Those numbers simply don't add up. Also the word disproportionate paints a significantly different picture than the actual numbers do. While a black man may be 2x more likely to be killed by police, the actual number of deaths is not disproportionate. \n\nI think a safe take-away is that, at least by the yearly numbers per-population, we're all very unlikely to die as a result of a police interaction, regardless of race. Considering there are some 50 million police to citizen interactions per year.",

            "comment": "Not sure i agree with this paragraph.\n\n *However, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of  diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce,  but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree or  higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up  16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s  degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the  US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral  degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies  as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.* \n\nIf we are talking about black workers make up for 11% of the us workforce then isn't it natural that only 7% make up for STEM jobs and 4% of medical doctors? i mean if they only make up for 1/10th of all jobs then isn't it unlikely all of that 1/10th are skilled enough for STEM jobs. Having 7% working in STEM jobs seems about accurate considering they only make up for 11% of working population. Also wouldn't this bring more attention to hispanic workers? they make up for 16% of the working population yet only have 6% of STEM jobs.\n\nAlso with this paragraph.\n\n *When black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19  deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In  Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19  deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but  account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to  work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these  industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to  have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in  medical care.* \n\nFirst you mention in Michigan black people make up for 40% of COVID-19 deaths however fail to mention health conditions that could be related to why that figure may be so high. According to this site:\n\n[https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=25](https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=25)\n\nnon-hispanic blacks are 1.3 times more likely to be obese compared to whites and they are 20% less likely to partake in physical activity. Also 4/5 african american women are overweight/obese and are 50% more likely to be obese compare to non-hispanic white population. Couldn't the percentage of COVID-19 deaths be more attributed health conditions which i can't see how that would correlate to systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. Also in that same paragraph you mention that black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs which could essentially contribute to that 40% death rate aswell? It just seems that these statistics are just being thrown around and drawing conclusions without explaining possibilities to why these statistics are so high IMO. I don't know the credibility of the link i provided as i do not live in the U.S.A so they could be wrong statistics so i welcome you to explain the situation better.",

The jury's still out on whether you're obligated to disseminate that information. I believe so, though.\n\nHowever, willfully ignoring evidence without rationale, or willfully not-observing what can and should rationally be observed undermines the whole process.",

I thought it was a point of the protests that blacks were unfairly singled out and had more interactions with the police, such as the stop and search/frisk \"random\" stops.\n\nIn fact, I find these numbers very awkward.  According to FBI stats, https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2017/crime-in-the-u.s.-2017/tables/table-43 , blacks account for roughly 27% of the arrests in the US total.  It seems somewhat \"in line\" - I apologize for the phrase - that 25% of the people the police kill are black, since, well, police can only kill who they interact with, and which roughly the same percentage are black.",

Perhaps more black people choose suicide by cop? \n\nAlso how many of these cops were black that killed their black criminal counterparts? \n\nI do believe black lives matter and this is a sad issue to address, but please bear with me.

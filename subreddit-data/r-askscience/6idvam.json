Great discussion everyone!\n\nalso yes ants don't have eyes i know that now. i just meant something small that does have eyes.\n\nEdit 2: ok ants DO have eyes.\n\nalso why am i on the front page for asking if elephants can see ants? this is the best day ever!\n\nFINAL EDIT: somebody gave me gold, and this has become the third top post ever on askscience... that is not how i was expecting this to go. thank you all!",

            "comment": "in terms of optics and photoreceptor density, which are the principal factors in a creature's visual resolution (\"details per degree of visual angle\"), there probably isn't much real difference between the *angular* visual resolution of e.g. a jumping spider and a house cat - both can see, at best, about ~10 details per degree. so if you shrank a cat down to spider size (or vice versa), they'd both have similar limits to the smallest things they could see.\n\nbut since they're different sizes, the sizes of the things they can see will also scale; since the eye is getting smaller, its ~~*near point*~~ (i think i meant 'depth of field' here) is getting proportionally shorter. so if a jumping spider's eye is a thousand times smaller than a cat's eye, it can potentially resolve details that are a thousand times smaller than what a cat's can resolve. a cat can never get optically close enough to a grain of sand to make it a degree wide, so that it could see 'ten details' on its surface, while this optical distance is easily available to the spider.\n\nthe caveat to this general scalability of vision is in the \"noisiness\" of light, i.e. factors like diffraction (limitation in how small of a point can be focused) or chromatic aberration (the difference in focal distance for different light wavelengths) - for a big eye with a big pupil, this noisiness is insignificant, but for a spider's eye it is getting significant, since all of us are looking at more-or-less the same light bandwidth. jumping spiders, for example, deal with this by having retinas at different focal depths to try to account for chromatic aberration.\n\nbut this stuff gets complicated, especially considering that the range in optical quality and photoreceptor density across species washes out most of these limitations. i think you could safely suppose that, in the range of terrestrial creature sizes, vision basically scales with size.\n\n*edit* the important thing is that things scale, but my concepts are confused re \"near point\" etc, see /u/craigdubyah for better/more detailed info---\n\n*edit edit* sorry i didn't keep up with this, was busy all day; but let me excuse the rough edges of my answer by saying it was a lot of well-informed hand waving and of course i didn't try to go into detail about diffraction and lens power and etc etc; i just wanted to get the basic gist across that vision should more-or-less scale with the size of the eye, receptor sampling being equal (as in the cat/spider comparison). field of view, pupil sizes, etc, all very important but another time and place, ok?",

That is why you see a rainbow pattern once light leaves a prism and the same applies to rainbows in the air, where the water is the medium responsinble for the bending.\n\nChromatic aberration is that principle applied to lenses. On photos you might see an object several times slightly offset and in different colours. That is not an error of the sensor or film, but the lens, which can't bring all different colors of an object onto the same pixel.",

It wasn't until Isaac Newton came along and invented the reflecting (or Newtonian) telescope that we could see clearly. Even the Hubble is a Newtonian design. (There are more compact modern scopes that use a mixture of reflection and refraction, but they're rare.) There was a top end to what refracting telescopes can see clearly because of chromatic aberration, and we hit it pretty hard.",

A tech put an extra washer into the machine that measured the surface polish of the mirror, so it was just a tiny bit out of whack.

They made it insanely accurately, just with some slightly bad maths, it was off by something like a couple thousandths of a degree/a fraction of an arc.\n  \n They basically had to calculate and make a contact lense to put in the end equipment neat the photo sensor from what I understand. Taking relatively closer pictures it was \"ok\", not great. But it was useless for the deep field (really far away) pictures that they put it in space for in the first place.",

Red light is a longer wavelength than blue light, and the index of refraction for a material is *dependent* upon the wavelength.\n\nIt's also why SLR lenses can be so expensive - a fixed zoom lens can be made nearly pristine since it only operates at a single focal length (I.e. Zoom  value).  \n\nA telephoto lens has to have good focus at different zoom positions AND for all those visible wavelengths.  So, a good lens will have extra coatings like ED on the lenses that affect dispersion the most.\n\nAchromatic lens groups are also often used - that's when a negative refracting element is bonded to a positive index of refraction element.  The ED coating is typically here.  \n\nCoatings and glass are what contribute to the high cost of lenses - $1k, $5k, $10k are not unheard of.  But, at least they're more resilient to obsolescence than the DSLR body...",

Using a 2000mm human instead,and assuming a spider's eyes are 5 times larger in proportion to human eyes, we get a ratio of 1:100. \n\nObjects the size of a ballpoint pen tip to us would compare to objects  0.005mm or 5 um to a spider. Here is a list of some objects that size:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(length)#1_micrometre\n\nInterestingly, that includes an E.

First, you mean the \"far point\".  Near point has to do with accommodation of the lens, which we aren't discussing here.\n\nThe far point is determined by the axial length of the eye and the refractive power.  If you make an eye proportionally smaller, you decrease the axial length and increase the refractive power at the same time.  They are inversely related, so they counteract each other, and the far point of the eye will remain unchanged.\n\nTo make an eye have a shorter far point, you need to change the proportions of the eye.\n\nThe diffraction limit would actually allow the larger eye to see more at short range.\n\nSource: ophthalmologist and optics researcher",

The far point of the eye will be unchanged.\n\n&gt;If an ant can look at a grain of sand from much closer than humans, shouldn't it also see more detail?\n\nThis is true if the ant eye is more nearsighted than the human eye (its far point is closer to the eye).  To do this, you have to change the proportions of the eye (either by adding refractive power or adding axial length).\n\nIf you took a human eye and made it just as nearsighted as an ant's eye, it would be able to see more detail than the ant's eye.  It's the same thing as being very nearsighted - someone's who is very nearsighted can remove their glasses and see finer detail by holding objects very close to their eye.  It has nothing to do with the overall size of the eye, it's the relationship between refractive power and axial length.",

In central vision we have the highest density of receptors, and that resolution falls off as it appears further from central vision (your *fovea*).  Since the sensation is more acute in central vision, we have more of those receptors getting their own ganglion cell and those ganglia have more representation in your visual cortex (called *cortical magnification*).  In the visual periphery, your receptors become bigger and more sparsely distributed, and they will often share a single ganglion cell, and will receive fewer cells in the visual cortex.  So, these cells have poor resolution, but they are much more sensitive to light intensity.  Your other senses show this kind of pattern, too! For instance, your hands have many sensory receptors and have the ability to detect fine textures better than by your tricep, but your ability to resolve pressure is much more sensitive by your tricep than your hand. \n\n\nFor your second question, keep in mind that the eyes are curved, which means that the retina will pick up different information based on where the image appears.  On the right side of your right eye, you are picking up information in the left visual field, and vice versa.  So the information between your eyes will be parsed at the optic chiasm so that the information from the same visual field is projected the the same hemisphere to create a more stable image.  \n\nEdit: a word",

I can't remember what it is called but about a year ago I saw a new camera being demo'd.\n\nBasically what it does is, say you have a potted plant. Take a still image. Then, rustle the leaves so that they are all moving ( or, I think they put a fan on it to create movement ) then the camera takes little snap pictures of it. It analyzes where the movement is and essentially creates an object of that part of the image in your program. They were then able to move the plant around in their program, even beyond what was normal in the fan blowing motion they filmed.\n\nIt is going to be used in movies (it may already have) to give us better 3d effects without having to use CGI. it looks hyper realistic. it is really impressive to watch and almost seems like it shouldn't be possible.",

A lot of higher-level math goes into doing that analysis, but the upshot is basically that you can use information from neighboring pixels or image locations to determine information about a given location. You can also extract information about high- and low-frequency spatial changes to determine what is being looked at, or what an image should look like.\n\nIf you're curious, the wikipedia page on [digital image processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing) goes into more detail, but it assumes that you have a little bit of prior knowledge.\n\nAs [u/2localboi](https://www.reddit.com/user/2localboi) pointed out, the same image sensor can be used to produce very different results. Recently, an engineer at Google used the Nexus 6P's camera to take some really breathtaking low-light images with his own custom algorithm, which he discusses in his [blog post](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/04/experimental-nighttime-photography-with.html).",

Nyquist sampling says we should have 2 sampling points per resolved distance, so if our eye was diffraction limited, we just about have that. The question is, are the optics good enough?\n\nAs it turns out, we have a little better Nyquist frequency than predicted by the cone pitch (60 cycles/degree for healthy eyes). It is speculated this could be due to the hexagonal packing of the cones in the fovea.\n\nSo, not only are we approximately diffraction limited (in the daytime), our retinal sampling is very well matched to our optics.\n\nAlong the same lines, the retinal sampling frequency decreases with field of view (or eccentricity), closely following the optical resolution of the eyes' optics, which have field dependent aberrations as the FOV increases.

Whales even more so, if we're comparing their air-vision to ours, but I'll bet they're great at seeing underwater.\n\nMy guess continued: Birds have better vision than we do for the most part (they can see things further away more clearly at least) because they had an evolutionary need to see rodents in the grass from far away. This doesn't negate whether bigger eyes (elephants/horses/whales) have higher quality vision than smaller though. So yeah, I don't know and would like to hear from a proper biologist.",

Cameras do not have scaled up sensor sizes because there's no room for more megapixels on smaller sensors, it's for other optical characteristics like dept of field (which is changed in having a wider sensor in the same way as having two eyes set apart gives you better depth perception than one alone). You can just as easily have a tiny cell phone sensor with 20 megapixels as you can a full frame sensor. There is a size limit to how small you can make the individual pixel size light detectors on a sensor but it hasn't been hit with current technology. Also, a smaller lens lets in less total light than a large one, but if the sensor that detects the light has been proportionately shrunk then the actual intensity of the light hitting any one spot on the sensor remains unchanged. In that way a small lens and small sensor can resolve an image just as well as a large sensor and large lens. If some larger sensor cameras are better in low light than small ones it's because of technological limitations that have not yet been overcome in manufacturing small sensors, not an inherent property of how light passes through lenses of various sizes.",

Random globs don't satisfy the ways those electrons can be arranged, so they would require huge forces to make atoms exist in a glob. Molecules are lower-energy, and all particles will lose energy if they can.\n\nTL;DR: Atoms form organized molecules because that's the easiest thing for them to do.",

First, our cones are called S, M, and L cones for short, middle, and long wavelengths, because they aren't just sensitive to \"blue, green, and red\" light, but to broader, overlapping ranges of the visible spectrum. Second, mantis shrimp have very different eyes, namely compound eyes, which technically don't have any cone cells, but other types of photoreceptors. And they certainly are not sensitive to the \"entire light spectrum\", just to a slightly wider range than ours. They can basically see our visible range (wavelengths of 400 to 700 nanometers) plus ultraviolet (280-400 nm).\n\n[Some further info here.](https://np.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3es7zc/the_mantis_shrimp_has_16_cones_what_exactly_can/cti5sop/)",

So bug vision and human vision are apples and oranges. Visual sharpness is a function of focus and resolution. Resolution is limited by a) the number of receptor cells used to draw an image and b) the color of light/radiation being perceived.\n\nThere's a physical limit to how small a microscopic thing that can be drawn with the 390-700nm visible light range, so it's not like tiny eyeballs could see viruses. Ants clearly see antennae and hairs on their nearby sisters, but it's not clear that ants can see our eyeballs at distance or a Paramecium in a water drop.\n\nThe sharpest visual acuity in human-like eyes is found in eagles and other raptor birds, as sharp as 20/5 or 20/4 as we can measure it. Eagles don't have large eyeballs, even for birds, but they have exceptionally dense receptor cells. It's estimate they could resolve ants from atop a 10-story building. I would see a palm-sized tile in the sidewalk; eagles would see tiny dots painted on it, and that some of them were moving.\n\nI've read anecdotally that elephants aren't \"afraid of mice\", but that they probably see mice as blurry, unfamiliar movement near their feet. If cantaloupes are clear and mice are blurry, then ants are probably \"microscopic\" to elephants.",

This is equivalent to having a camera with a tiny aperture. If you have glasses, try taking them off, making a really tiny hole with your fingers and looking through it - you'll see clearer. This is also why squinting helps you see - you're looking through the tiny holes in your eyelashes. This makes both near *and* far clearer - what photographers call \"increased depth of field\". The tradeoff is brightness - make the hole too small and not enough light gets in. \n\nOn the other hand, if you grew an eye, the iris would get larger, eventually it would be a gaping hole and the eye wouldn't be very functional at all. With a quarter sized iris I would guess you could still tell things like the direction of the sun and such, but not much more. \n\nThe size of the lense, on the other hand, makes no difference. It's the shape of the lense that determines whether the eye sees near or far, not the size. \n\nQuick visual explanation of pinhole effect: http://i199.photobucket.com/albums/aa90/kimsoonee/home%20video%20audio/pinhole-effect-on-eye.jpg",

                    "comment": "Wow, a whole lot of almost-right things here, but mostly very wrong.\n\nA smaller iris doesn't allow sharper vision. What is actually going on is that your eye's lens has aberrations that increase towards its edges. Block those edges out by making the iris smaller, and you see sharper (but less light gets in). So, what makes \"stopping down\" or looking through a small hole in your fingers work is simply that you are blocking the most blurry light rays from the edges of the lens.\n\nIn fact, a larger iris would allow a sharper image, if your eyes had lenses that weren't worse at the edges. This is limited by the Rayleigh Criterion, which in turn is due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The least-resolvable angle is proportional to the inverse of the aperture:\ntheta ~= 1.22 D / wavelength\n\n&gt; The size of the lense, on the other hand, makes no difference.\n\nDead wrong, as the previous paragraph points out. The size of the USED PORTION of the lens impacts both the aberrations allowed through (which, for simple lenses, increase with radius) and the Rayleigh limit on the resolution a perfect lens could achieve.\n\nNow, human eyes are very, very far from having perfect lenses. Obviously - there are animals with better vision than we have, and many of them (eagles) have smaller eyes (which have larger Rayleigh limits on their resolution - bigger openings allow finer detail through a perfect lens). And human eyes vary widely from person to person. I am diopter 12 nearsighted without correction, which means (in layman terms) I can't see shit beyond my nose (pretty much). The correction for this actually demagnifies (reduces) things on my eye, meaning what would cover two rods on your eye might only cover one rod on mine. Rods and cones are the two types of light-receivers in your eye; they are the equivalent of pixels on a camera detector. Ergo, my ability to see detail - even after I put on glasses to correct my vision - is half of a normal person's.\n\nNow, suppose an animal evolves rods that are one-half the size of human eye rod cells. That animal could, if its eye lenses were good enough (and the diameter of the eye wide enough), see things twice as well as humans can.\n\nOR... the animal could evolve eyes with more curvature. That's the equivalent of having higher-power binoculars. It would see more sharply... but less widely. Maybe it could see a mouse a mile away... but not a predator just to the right of its field of view. Pretty ugly tradeoff.\n\nHOWEVER... biological lenses aren't made of glass; they can flex. Muscles in the eye can actually change that curvature. Typically this is used to adjust focus - which is called \"accommodation\", something people under 40 have more of than I do (sucks to be me). But if used to an extreme, it can be used to change eyesight from seeing pretty much everything all around you (but not sharply) to seeing extremely well (but only in a small area). I honestly don't know if animals like eagles do this, but it would make sense. The odds of someone sneaking up on an eagle in midair are somewhat low, after all, and once it lands it can revert to seeing all around.\n",

Because of an aperture (pupil/camera objective) in the system cutting off some of the electromagnetic field of the source point, we cannot put it back together to a point. Part of the field gets lost and the result is diffraction at an aperture, with which a theoretical point on the object gets imaged into this so called Airy disk. This fundamentally limits the resolution of an image and if this is the only source of disturbance in or image, it's the best optical system we can have (a diffraction limited optical system). So, an image is made up of the sum of blurry spots and how blurry they are is dependant on the ratio between wavelength and diameter of the aperture. The more of the electromagnetic field from the object we gather, the less blurry the image of a point can become and the more detail we can resolve.\n\nSomeone hit me if I made a mistake as well.",

            "comment": "It really depends on the organism and the structures that make up their eye. Eyes have a lens to focus light onto photoreceptor cells that transfer that light into info for the brain. The main two photoreceptors are rods, which are good at seeing contrast between dark and light, and cones, which respond to specific wavelengths of light and give us color vision.\n\nThe ability to see something (called visual acuity) is measured as the smallest width an object can be and still be seen. To get a greater acuity, you either have to change the lens to focus the light better (like wearing glasses) or you have to pack more photoreceptors into your eye. For example, birds like eagles have similar sized eyes to humans but have about 5 times as many photoreceptors per square millimeter. Better vision is more common in animals that need to make out a lot of fine details, either predators that need to spot prey or nocturnal animals that have to see in the dark.\n\nThe issue with small organisms like ants is that their eyes aren't big enough to have a lot of photoreceptors, so they can mostly make out things like light/dark and general shapes and patterns. Some arthropods deal with this by having compound eyes, which gives them a greater area for photoreceptors, or simply grow massive eyes that take up a large part of their head.\n\nFor larger organisms like elephants, we can actually estimate their visual acuity by using a striped, spinning circle. Eyes will naturally follow movement, so if the stripes can be distinguished, you can see eye movement. If the stripes are too small, the circle will appear as one color and the eye won't track anything, so no movement. For Asian elephants, they found that at 2 meters from the eye, the smallest thing they can see is something a half centimeter across (about a quarter inch at 6 and a half feet, if you're an Imperial user like me).\n\nTl;dr, Vision depends on the animal's needs and its size. Ants are small and their eyes aren't big enough to be able to see fine detail. Elephants can see things about a half centimeter across if it's 2 meters from its face or closer.",

Of course that varies from creature to creature but... I'm pretty sure the smaller organisms in this world tend to sense the world around it quite differently than we do. Like through feelers instead and stuff rather than focusing on eyesight. \nEven cats don't exactly have the best eyesight. They cant see their prey unless it moves which is why when they are hunting something they will \"cackle\" and swish their tail to get the creature to move so they can attack. Their eyes are great for night time but daytime viewing is sacrificed for that ability. I can tell you when i feed my cat treats i have to make sure she sees exactly where i put it.

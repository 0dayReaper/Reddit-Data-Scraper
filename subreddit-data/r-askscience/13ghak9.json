Wax isn't a suitable molding material for casting, its a positive mold material for making complex 'lost wax' casting where the material around the wax is the mold, the wax is to make an impression in the mold material where it would be impratical to ever remove the object after making the mold before casting. (hence 'lost wax', the casting metal comes in and vaporizes the wax outta the mold, hence only good for 1 casting..)\n\nIts also why you see a lot of products claim 'die cast' as a feature. It means incredibly precise details and smooth surfaces can be made in one step. \n\nOf course, die cast also generally means they used some low temp allow like zinc based alloys, since you can't really cast steel/iron in a steel/iron mold. But zinc alloys are likely fine for transferring ink to paper.",

                    "comment": "Per the tediousness, I'm curious about the price of the early printing presses. Pre-assuming I won't find meaningful estimates for the first printing press as OP asked about, I *briefly* looked up the first presses in the British American colonies -- still (mostly) pre-industrial. [Mass Bay gets the first one in 1638, a basic wooden press worth 20 pounds](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/03/harvards-first-impressions/) (2023 US$3500) that shipped with about 40 pounds (money) of paper. [The Brits would fully subsidize each colony to buy a decent press, with South Carolina in particular getting 175 pounds](https://www.abaa.org/member-articles/the-first-hundred-years-of-printing-in-british-north-america-printers-and-c) (about 31k today) which presumably(?) would more than cover the capital for their first press in 1749 (regardless, the Early Modern pound value stays quite flat). This is the [CPI inflation given by the Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation/inflation-calculator), and having seen it the data are *extremely good*, but it's a general index -- likely grain-heavy at this time -- and not specific to the skilled metalworking required for typemaking, which I imagine would be paid at a significantly different scale. But as a baseline the 31k equivalent price still seems remarkably low for the labor involved. \n\nAlso I found [the price of paper would come down in the early 1800s with a new industrial process](https://guides.highpoint.edu/c.php?g=1213119&amp;p=8873594) -- this seems an odd time to me since pamphletting was huge in the late 18th century in part because of their relative cheapness, so there must have been a huge improvement in paper manufacturing prior to this.",

Since the FM radio frequency band was in the middle of the VHF TV channels, in between channels 6 and 7, it wasn't uncommon for cable TV providers to offer local FM radio stations and other stations not normally available locally, along with TV service.  MTV provided stereo audio service to cable provides to broadcast on the FM band to their subscribers.  All you needed to do to hear MTV in stereo was connect your home stereo receiver to cable and tune to the correct FM frequency.  This was called 'simulcast' and sometimes 'stereocast'.  \n\nMTV didn't originate the idea of providing stereo audio to accompany their video programming, but it was certainly better that listening to 1980s music videos on the tinny speaker of a TV set; and more importantly, Louder!\n\nI recall watching the premier of the music video for Dire Straits 'Money for Nothing' on MTV in glorious stereo (and recording it in stereo on my Betamax VCR \ud83d\ude06).",

Once you have your mold made, you can cast the type, often in lead because of the low melting point.  \n\nOnce you have the letters made, The type is set from 2 large cases.  The upper case, and the lower case.  Cold type is cast letters that are taken from the cases and set into a tray held in the left hand which is then set into the block which will ultimately be inked and pressed against the paper.  You can kern the letters using the edge of a knife to make the letters fit together pretty if you're being fancy.  You can increase the distance between the lines with thin sheets of lead.  Thus the term, \"leading\".\n\nOnce your block is set, you can tighten up the wood around the edges and can use that to print as many copies as you need.  If you are printing form letters, you would print them with gaps in the text as your stationary, then print over those templates for the final letter making it look like one print.\n\nYou may save the completed blocks as long as you need to, or break them apart and use the individual characters again.\n\nYou also have hot type which is done by a Linotype machine typically.  It can print complete lines of type using hot lead which can then be set in the block to print like normal.  When you're done printing, you dump the letters back into the hopper and they get melted for reuse.\n\nUltimately, the answer is that it is a slow process.  However, you'd be surprised at how fast typesetters are with a few years of practice.",

If an unexpected new ratio is needed, go back to step 1. Create a test product out of the master tools to ensure they work.\n\n3: copy a set of sub-master tools from the master tools. Ensure precision between them by using them to produce a test product. Engrave or otherwise record their physical dimensions on a hard medium, such as stone or metal plate. Retire the master tools to preserve them.\n\n4: use sub-master tools to create runs of copies. Test each set of copies in a production run before shipping for mass use. When the sub-master tools begin to produce inconsistent copy tools, permanently retire them. When you run low on sub-masters, make new ones from the master tools.\n\n5: if the master tool is lost- derive a new one from its recordings. If the recording is lost, derive one from careful consistent measurement of the highest quality example on hand.\n\n\nThis is a logical process of maintaining internal consistency- and does not necessarily need to refer to any centralized system of measurements or precision tools derived from them. So long as the ratios are set at the beginning and maintained throughout, the physical dimensions of the products produced might vary between production runs or other products, but those inconsistencies are of little importance.\n\nTypesetting is very meticulous work and likely used a rigorous process made from a more specific version of the general practice I listed above.",

Also i learned what a cornerstone actually was and why it was important for the future generations inheriting the building. \n\nStonemasons, carpenters, blacksmiths, tailors and cobblers were all using these methods long before the industrial revolution. The 'hickledy pickledy' nature of it all was due to incomprehensible local customs but an underlying logic was very widespread and sophisticated among craftsmen and severely underappreciated by the aristocracy who demanded simpler systems they could wrap their heads around.\n\nThe book \"Seeing Like a State\" by James C Scott layed out in detail the reasons why we ever started using non-trade standard measurements in the first place. The trend has only continued with the mechanization of production- leading to people that don't even understand the logic of units and measure. Its obscene.",

There was another important technique of reproduction that was invented long before moveable type and that is Wood block printing, a method still used widely mmmm Im op Think of carving a very intricate pattern from a block of wood.  Your block would be made of a very hard wood species. Apply ink to the raised portions of the wood block and press it onto a piece of fabric or paper. Now imagine carving letters and words into the block by gouging and carving away the wood and leaving raised letters. You need to be very skilled at carving. Now imagine that block being used to print a flyer or a page of a book.\n\nThink of wood block printing as a  bridge between texts being copied onto vellum by medieval scribes and Texts being reproduced on paper using moveable type.

            "comment": "You can basically do the same thing as you would with some questionable old food in your fridge.\n\n\nYou can smell things, and if they smell bad, then don't eat them. If they pass the sniff test, you can taste a small bit on your tongue, and if it tastes bad, you can spit it out. If it tastes okay, then you can try eating a very small amount, see if it makes you vomit or gives you diarrhea, or otherwise makes you ill. If it doesn't, you can ramp up the quantity eaten slowly.\n\n\n It sounds kinda barbaric, but nasty smells, bitter tastes, vomitting, and diarrhea are your bodies natural way of detecting and getting rid of toxins. Plus, most conventionally toxic stuff in nature isn't so crazy dangerous that a small nibble will outright kill a healthy adult.\n\n\nEven highly toxic plants like deadly nightshade aren't going to flat out kill someone who weighs 70+ kg if you just eat like half a berry.",

By elimination, they started to figure out what was safe and what wasn't, and became ingrained into that group's cultural knowledge.",

            "comment": "*Historically*, trial and error.\n\nTomatoes when introduced to the old world from the new world, initially were thought to be poisonous for a few hundred years and only grown as decorative plants.  Like, tomato sauce on a pizza is *only* 200 years old.\n\n*Modern* times we do toxicology studies on mostly animals.  Or we look at accidental exposure from workers or drug addicts or suicides and file case reports that go into huge toxicological databases.\n\nA relevant number is called LD50 (lethal dose, 50% of the population).  For food, better to use a LD5 (lethal dose, 5% of the population).\n\nYou take 100 rats and feed them X grams of test food.  Measure how many die.  Keep increasing the mass of X until 50% of those rats die.  Weigh the rats, weigh the food, and you can determine something like 0.5 g food / 1 kg of body mass is poisonous.  Historically, an animal population was about 20-50 for the test but in some situations it move towards a few hundred animals.\n\nNow we don't really do that anymore.  Instead, we do a leapfrog study with as few as 2 test animals, more typically 5.  You feed rat 1 X grams today and rat 2 gets X+Y grams.  You keep feeding them more each day until one gets sick.  Then you stop and you know the \"safe\" lower dose where rat 1 didn't get sick.\n\nThere are other animals models.  For instance, we know rats can tolerate a lot of garbage that humans cannot. \n Another example: grapes are great for humans but will kill about 30% of dogs and make the rest really sick.  So we may use sheep or pigs or horses for the studies.  Horses are easy because they are so physically huge that it's easy to detect a minor sickness early, they can recover fast, lots of horse medications developed for the racing industry, and people love to keep old horses as pets even if they have health issues.\n\nUnfortunately, every single animal that is used in toxicological testing is euthanized (almost).  Their insides need to be examined for non-obvious symptoms such as fatty livers or declining kidneys, but also it's cruel to leave them alive when potentially you have shortened their lifespan simply by doing the test.",

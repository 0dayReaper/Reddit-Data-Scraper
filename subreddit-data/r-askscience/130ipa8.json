    "postText": "So the oceans on our planet are salty because of the presence of dissolved minerals in the water, Including weathering and erosion of rocks, volcanic activity,  and the natural processes of the ocean itself. \n\nBut would it be possible to have alien planets who's waters are entirely unsalted? Like freshwater? I know we can't know cause we've never been to any nor in our lifetimes. But would it be possible?",

            "comment": "Certain chemical elements are highly water soluble. They are also reasonably common as the materials for a rocky planet to be formed from (things like sodium, lithium, chlorine etc). It would be very unlikely that a planet with liquid water on it would not have any processes in which these elements would end up getting dissolved into the water, especially so if there is dry land and an evaporation/precipitation water cycle that would cause water based erosion of rocks. Even without this, where the water meets the rock, over geological time some of the minerals from the rock would eventually leech out into the water.",

            "comment": "It depends on how you define ocean and the geology of the planet. Every planet with water that is liquid, will have some sort of water cycling.\n\nOn Earth, fresh water erodes the land and causes salt to dissolve and run until it collects in a location where it evaporates. Wherever water evaporates, is where it becomes salty on earth. Even water just sitting will absorb salt from the land, unless you feed in enough fresh water to dilute it, and water leaves with the salt (only possible in liquid form).\n\nA good way to frame this is, where does fresh water come from and can enough collect to create a fresh ocean? The only ways to purify salt water, and get fresh water are: osmosis, evaporation-condensation, and freezing.\n\nWith a normal evaporation-condensation cycle it's only possible with 2 oceans.\n\nA few ways it could occur are an ocean on a warmer side of the planet, which then rain on the cold side. Maybe a planet with significant axial tilt could cause this. Another option is a very shallow ocean in 1 spot, which evaporates due to massive surface area, and a very deep ocean but small surface area on the fresh side. You could also have a planet with little tectonic activity resulting in a wall between several bodies, allowing this unique formation to occur. The fresh ocean must then drain to the salt ocean, by some liquid flow.\n\nThe other option which could give a single ocean of fresh water, is a water cycle of  freezing, maybe with an elliptical orbit, which results in a glacial age, and a thawing age. This freeze would cause a concentration of salt water as the salt is rejected during solidification of the ice, trapping it below or pushing it into the ocean bed. Creating fresh ice on the surface, which would also melt first being at the top during the warming age.\n\nThere is also the possibility of a slowly rotating planet. Freezing on the far side of the planet, liquid on the star facing side. As the planet rotates, the transition point going from warm to freezing would be the salt ocean. The other transition point from freezing to warm would be the fresh water source.",

What makes up a typical rocky world planet, elementally?   Would you expect the physics of another planet in the goldilocks region to be the same as the physics that our planet has?     Therefore, salty liquid water in the deepest basins of that world would be highly likely.",

            "comment": "It would be difficult to do this, however, there are enough planets in the universe that its a possibility.  Imagine if a very large dwarf planet made of cometary debris were to be impacted by another cometary dwarf planet at the Kuiper Belt inner planetary speeds (50km/s).  The impact would be large enough to melt both bolides, and allow for differentiation similar to the Earth in its early formation. Then allow the bodies to coalesce. \n\nNow do it again, two, three, four times. Every time the bolides impact, and the bodies melt, further differentiation occurs, and the water that is ejected would become cleaner and cleaner.  \n\nUltimately, this ejected water would form a new bolide, and if there were enough cometary debris in the local area, you could conceivably create a water planet, with a fairly small core, that could be pretty clean.  Of course this is a hypothesis that can bear no fruit as there is no way to test such a thing, but in a Universe that is 48 Billion light-years across (at least), there is bound to be one fresh water planet floating around out there.  Now imagine if it were in the habitable ring around the sun....  No beaches, but a pool party to rival all pool parties.",

            "comment": "There are several factors you can consider:\n\n(1) The earlier in the Universe's history the planet formed in, the fewer heavier elements (and thus minerals) there would likely be in the planet's composition (because fusion hadn't created many yet).\n\n(2) The larger the proportion of water to rocky material a planet is made of, the less minerals there are to dissolve and thus the more dilute the resulting solution would be. This would favor larger planets, as they attract more hydrogen and thus can form more water.\n\n(3) The colder water is, the fewer dissolved solids it can hold and the fresher it will be. This favors planets far from their stars. This also favors very old planets as there would be less internal heat from their formation and radioactive decay.",

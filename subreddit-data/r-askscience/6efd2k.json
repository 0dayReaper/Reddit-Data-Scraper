            "comment": "To understand why not, you have to understand how a battery works. It's not a tank of electrons, exactly. A battery is a chemical reaction between an anode (-), cathode (+), and an electrolyte (or some form of conduit) which facilitates the exchange of electrons.\n\nWhen you discharge (use) a battery, a chemical reaction is occurring, moving electrons between the two chemicals (anode and cathode). So, don't think of a battery as a vessel which just holds a pile of electricity. It's a specific transfer of energy between two chemicals.\n\nNow, in a rechargeable battery, this reaction can be reversed by applying electricity using a charger. But, again, it's not adding anything, really. It's reversing the chemical reaction which is putting the chemicals back to their original state.\n\nWhen charging, it takes time for the reaction to reverse and at the same time, heat is created because the electrons are moving back across the conduit they travelled across originally. Electrons moving over a conductor meet resistance which creates heat, no matter which direction. Much like the battery heating up when you use the phone, the battery will heat up while charging for the same reason. If you were to throw a bunch of current at the battery, it could easily cause a thermal issue. Nickel-cadmium (NiCd: pronounced Nye-Cad) batteries had a problem called thermal runaway where the battery, if charged too quickly, the heat generated could induce a self-feeding loop where the battery could heat to a point of ignition or explosion. But that's not an issue with Lead-Acid batteries (like sealed lead acid batteries like in your car, which use a liquid electrolyte, also known as a wet cell [thanks to u/gilescoreywasframed for the correction below]). Also prone are Lithium Ion (LiOn, like in your cell phone) or Lithium-Polymer (Li-PO) batteries (credit to u/incrediboy729 for the correction here), but these usually incorporate circuitry to prevent this situation.\n\ntl;dr - it is dangerous, and modern cell phone chargers and batteries have circuitry to prevent too fast/overcharging which could lead to heat damage or fire.",

But essentially, there is a barrier between the cathode and anode. In order to cram more juice into the battery the manufacturer reduces the barrier between them. If the barrier is damaged, the electrons can flow freely between the cathode and anode causing a short circuit. This in turn creates an insane amount of heat destroying the barrier, and causing a more intense short circuit. The energy released by this takes on the form of an explosion. ",

These are little metallic structures the branch out from the walls of the battery. While these are dangerous, they are well understood and generally are accounted for when designing batteries. The problem with the Note 7 battery issue was two-fold: \n\n- One, the battery was too small, meaning the dendrites could form and touch, causing a short circuit. \n\n- Two: any thermal expansion that occurred was poorly handled as there was almost no clearance in the battery chamber to compensate for it. The combined pressure of the battery against the inside of the phone and the rapid formation of dendrites (and their eventual contact with each-other) lead to a really big short-circuit, causing rapid heating and ultimately an explosion.\n\nAdditionally, the pressure within the battery caused the metallic plates within the battery to fold inwards towards each-other at the corners, also causing an explosion.\n\nTechradar has a [reasonably competent article](http://www.techradar.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-battery-fires-heres-why-they-exploded) explaining it, but doesn't cover the dendrites.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about dendrites, specifically pertaining to rechargeable batteries, here is an [informative article](http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2013/12/17/roots-of-the-lithium-battery/).\n\n**EDIT: Fixed some grammar and spelling issues.

The inventor's explanation is that the layer on the other electrode is thin enough to not change the surface's fermi energy so that it still works, but other experts are still somewhat critical. The project is only receiving the amount of recognition it does because Goodenough is involved. \n\nIt's still very promising, but with how other attempts at new battery technologies flopped, a certain degree of skepticism whether or not it will be a breakthrough is probably still appropriate.

This is also why Lithium is regulated for shipment.\nUnfortunately, Samsung has gone to making their cases sealed, otherwise they could have saved a fortune in providing a higher quality replacement battery instead of an outright recall. It's also why I still have my Note4. I've replaced 2 batteries with it, and its still going strong. ",

For some stupid reason, marketing departments started pushing \"thinner is better\" so hard that it's now somewhat engrained in public perception. If this wasn't the case, manufacturers would be free to produce more resilient designs at the expense of a bit of thickness.\n\nI, personally, couldn't care less about a phone being thinner than, say, a centimeter, if it meant more battery capacity, fewer design issues causing recalls/issues, more RAM, etc. But I realize I'm in the minority :(",

Let's say you're aiming for 2000 mAh capacity, which is rather common these days for smartphones. That means your battery or capacitor can deliver, on average, about 2000 mA (or 2 A) of current for 1 hour (or 3600 seconds) before expiring.\n\nAssuming a lot of simplifying hypotheses, that's equivalent to 20 A for 360 seconds. Or 200 A for 36 seconds.\n\nBut charging is the opposite of discharging. So, to charge that thing, you'd need to provide it with 200 A of charge current for 36 seconds.\n\n200 A is *a heck of a lot* of current. It's what my TIG welder does. Have you seen the cables coming out of a welder? That's what you need to safely run 200 A to your phone. Multiply that by, say, 5 V, and it's 1 kW of power. Your \"phone charger\" now looks about as bulky as a TIG welder.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the issue of having cables inside the phone that can withstand 200 A, which is going to be extremely tricky at least. Maybe just expose the capacitor's plates directly on the outside shell.\n\nFor all these reasons, even when ultracapacitors will finally become a reality, you should probably not expect instant charge, or at least not any time soon. It's a pretty difficult thing to do, because, frankly, it's a big chunk of energy.",

The heat is also not necessarily just produced within the battery, but also by the regulation electronics that control the electrical energy coming in from the charger and going into the battery.\n\nHigher temperature (if it's not dangerously high), for electronics and batteries, translates to a shorter lifespan. Faster charging is necessarily a tradeoff between temperature/lifespan and convenience. However, fast charging is not in itself dangerous if the battery and regulation electronics support the current, and a properly designed fast charger detects when the fast charge rate is possible (communicates with the device to see if it supports fast charging, has safeties to detect conditions that seem wrong).",

USB provides 5 volts of power at up to 500mA normally; multiplying these together, you get a charge rate of 2.5W max. Now, plenty of chargers and phones bend the rules, and can get up to about 2.1A, for around 10W, but that's about the limit - higher than that and the resistance of the USB cable's wires becomes a real issue.\n\nTo work around this, some fast chargers support negotiating with the phone to provide a higher _voltage_ - often 9, 12, or 15 volts. This causes a corresponding increase in power delivered, as you can still run the same 2.1A but you're multiplying by a higher voltage; however it requires more expensive and complex circuits on both the phone and charger to handle the higher (and variable) voltage.\n\nNote that in all cases the phone is in charge of how much power it's actually consuming - the adapter merely sets the upper limit. If your battery is heating up, the phone will reduce charge rate, and likewise will reduce charge rate, often quite dramatically, when the battery is either nearly empty or nearly full to reduce stress on the battery.",

                    "comment": "More complex answer: First off, a rechargeable lithium battery comprises these parts:\n\nLithium compound (Anode) || Separator || SEI || Graphite (cathode)\n\nThe lithium compound can be a number of things, and has the biggest difference between types of lithium batteries.  Lets not worry about the specifics right now, just know that when you charge the battery, lithium ions move from here to the cathode.\n\nThe separator is a thin plastic film that the ions can move through, but electricity can't.  IIRC its usually polypropylene, but its the least special part of the battery.\n\nThe graphite cathode is a pulverized mix of small graphite particles, less than 150 microns across.  Usually a mix of synthetic and natural.  Lithium ions \"intercalate\" into the graphite somewhat like water into a sugar cube.  Incidentally, this causes the graphite to expand, so batteries need to be built very sturdily to resist this movement as much as possible.  It was once thought this action led to batteries degrading, but we don't think that any more.\n\nThe SEI is the solid electrolyte interface and is the most trade-secret-y part of the battery.  It's an extremely complex mishmash of junk that serves the same purpose as the separator but is even better at it.  It builds up over time and causes capacity loss.\n\nThe SEI is a mix of lithium and broken-down electrolyte, forming a compressed granular goop.  Heat and high voltage cause it to build up by breaking down the electrolyte faster.  Even at low voltages in the cold, the presence of lithium ions alone breaks down the electrolyte, because lithium is so reactive.\n\nFast-charging batteries use a thinner, wider spread of these layers.  That reduces the distance the lithium ions have to move, and the voltage they need to charge.  That's just a stop-gap.  In order to charge faster you need a higher voltage and current, and those cause the SEI to build up faster, reducing the lifetime of the battery.  At ~.7 volts higher than the battery, the most important components of the electrolyte start breaking down, and lifetime is reduced by over 20x.\n\nAll of that is even before heat production in the battery.  You can make the electrodes larger so they have lower resistance, but the chemical reaction itself will still produce an increasing amount of heat- those ions moving around make heat just like electrons moving around.",

The top comment discusses electrons, but the resistance due to electronic movement in a battery is far far smaller than that caused by ionic movement. The heating of a battery during fast charging is mostly due to ionic overpotentials.\n\nTo go back to OP's question, a simple hydraulic analogy might work. Imagine having a bottle (your discharged battery) and a bucket full of water (where water is electrical energy). Now, if you slowly tilt the bucket and let the water trickle in the bottle you'll have a full bottle with very little spillage (I.e. Waste), but it will take a long time. If, on the other hand, you just turn the bucket over the bottle you'll end up with a very fast charge, but a lot of spillage.",

Different metals react better to induction. It generally won't do much of anything to your hand. That's not to say that an inductive surface won't get hot since it's in direct contact with a heated material, but that's not the induction heating it up; that's conduction.\n\nFerrous materials (ferrous = containing iron) generally work best. Cast iron works better than stainless. Stainless works significantly better than aluminum. There is cookware that uses a ferrous base which will transfer its heat by CONduction into the rest of the material, which kind of gets the best of both worlds, if you will.\n\n[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_cooking) Wikipedia article explains it quite well.\n\nAluminum has been popular with pots and pans because it's an easier material to manufacture and it heats up much quicker than iron and stainless, but because of this, it also doesn't hold heat as readily. Copper is similar (soft and heats up fast), but it is an expensive material. Plus, it oxidizes and can be difficult to clean.",

AC magnetic fields will induce an electromotive force, i.e. something pushing on charges (electrons are the ones that matter).  But your hand is not a good conductor so not much current is generated---current is what makes heat.\n\nNow aluminium is a better electrical conductor (lower electrical resistance) than cast iron, so you'd think that it would work better than cast iron pans in an induction stove but there is another effect going on that's really important. \n\nCast iron, unlike aluminum, is a 'soft ferromagnet'.  This means that because of some complicated peculiarities of quantum mechanics in these atoms, some of their electrons like to line up their magnetic fields in the same direction and peer-pressure each other to do the same.  Think of a North Korean parade taking marching orders from the Magnetic Leader.  (Electrons always make their own little magnetic fields, but most of the time they are in random directions so doesn't add up to very much on the human scale, unless you have a ferromagnetic material).\n\nThe implication is that the AC magnetic field from the induction coil is greatly amplified within the cast iron pan (hundreds or thousands of times), and therefore the efficiency and capacity of the transfer of power through the magnetic field is much greater, so you can heat it up the pan substantially.\n\nThis is the same reason that purpose-built electrical transformers are heavy---they have iron/ferromagnetic loops to amplify and contain the magnetic field for maximum power transfer efficiency and capacity.  It isn't an exaggeration to say that modern electrically powered civilization depends on an accident of quantum mechanics. ",

For example, a 12V lead acid battery require a minimum of 13.5V to ensure a full charge (which take 12-16 hours at that voltage). A 14.4V is used (which give 5 hours). At 15V the acid start to boil, and at 16 your would cause the plates to corrode due to the overcharge.\n\nWith lithium, it is simmilar, the 3.7V need 4.2V and at 4.4-4.5 you damage the cells, which can cause a runaway reaction and fire.\n\nFrom what I understand from quickcharge is that they charge it with too much voltage and current, but carefully monitor the charge state and stop before the damage occur. But it still reduce the life of the battery, plus it don,t always work safelly.",

For a 1C battery, you can charge it in (roughly, omitting losses) 1 hour by putting in 1A for every Ah of capacity. So a 2000mAh battery would charge at 2A, and a 4Ah battery would charge at 4A - both are 1C of charging.\n\nIf you had a 20C battery you could charge it at 20x that rate - so in 3 minutes, you could put 80A into a 4Ah battery and have it \"full\" - again, disregarding losses. You could also use this battery at 30C perhaps - giving you the entire capacity of power in 2 minutes, which is pretty good if you're making a drone or quadcopter.\n\nInversely, you could take a larger battery and, with the same discharge rate (in A) get a larger lifetime, and a smaller discharge measured in C. This is both good for being able to use the device for longer, and having a longer battery lifetime. Downside is obviously cost, weight and size.",

As everyone is saying this process necessarily takes a while and is fairly inefficient, hence battery chargers getting hot, heat production=wasted energy. This is essentially the same difference between lightbulb types. Incandescents are very inefficient, so they get very hot, CFLs are fairly efficient so they only get warm and LEDs are very efficient so they barely produce heat at all.",

That's a pretty fixed figure, so with a constant voltage and resistance, the current will be constant - and not all flow into the phone at once (unless the phone was faulty).\n\nThe point is that if the phone was faulty and had reduced resistance, a LOT of current could flow VERY quickly - but this is the same for any device, a light bulb, food mixer, whatever, and is uncommon (and is always a big problem if it happens, which is why we have fuses!)",

Not just the surface, it needs to penetrate fairly deep although they do try to keep the anode/cathode thin.\n\nYou're not just moving electrons, like a capacitor.  You're pumping whole atoms from one side, through liquid, to the other.  There's no physical pump, of course.  The electric field coerces them to leave and diffuse on and infuse into the anode.  That's a slow process, relatively speaking. ",

            "comment": "I see a lot of good responses here, but didn't see one word in particular. Charging a lithium battery too quickly will result in the formation of *dendrites*, physical deformities inside the battery that look like little tentacles. These occur naturally during \"normal\" use and are part of the reason why no lithium-based battery is good forever, but their growth is exacerbated by very fast charging, among other things. These little tendrils inside the battery reduce how much charge it can store, reduce its ability to perform well even when charged, reduce how much longer it is good for (i.e. remaining charge cycles before the battery is useless), and are believed to increase the risk of a catastrophic failure of the battery.\n\nOne way \"around\" this (sort of) is the software-defined battery. A device can have multiple batteries of different chemistries that are exposed to its operating system as a single battery. The charging circuit intelligently controls charging and discharging in a way that takes advantage of these chemistries. For example, you can have a normal lithium-ion battery and a second one that is more tolerant to fast charging. The charging circuit would provide lots of power to the more tolerant battery initially to give you a usable starting charge quickly, then would slowly charge the second (presumably higher-capacity and longer-life) battery.\n\nIn short, with the types of batteries used in phones, it's bad for the battery and potentially dangerous to charge the battery quickly. We have ways of getting around it - to a point - but at some point we're probably going to need a change in battery chemistry to get the best of both worlds out of a single battery.\n\nEdit: italicized the word \"dendrites\" since that was the whole reason I made this post.",

It's not an issue of heat, or cabling, or wall chargers, it's an issue of our current state of the art in battery technology and charging-induced damage.\n\nEvery time you charge a battery, you damage it, permanently, irreparably.  The amount of damage you do depends almost entirely on the speed at which you're charging it, faster charging = more damage.  Different battery architectures/chemistries have different limits on the rate at which you can charge/discharge it with minimal damage, but unfortunately the chemistries which allow faster charging almost universally have a lower energy density.\n\nYou can ABSOLUTELY grab a lithium-based battery that can charge at 10C (dead to full charge in ~6 minutes) with minimal damage (eg: LiFePO4), but it has an energy density roughly half of what's in your cell phone, which means it would need to be twice the physical size/weight for the same capacity.\n\nThe high density batteries used in phones/laptops to make them smaller/lighter can really only be charged at a maximum rate of around 0.5C without causing TOO much damage, which means flat to full charge in ~2 hours minimum.  If you try to charge it any faster than that, you'll cut significantly into the battery's lifetime.  Instead of it lasting a year and a half before becoming mostly unusable, it might only last 6 months.\n\nThis works the other way as well, if you throw your \"ultra fast super charger\" in the closet and use an old 0.5A or even 1A charger instead, you can extend the lifetime of your battery significantly.  Reserve your fast chargers for when you actually need them, use a slower charger overnight and your battery will thank you.",

It's worth having a concept of Ohm's law as to why this is the case. Ohm's law relates voltage (volts), current (amperage), and resistance (ohms). This is [a decent picture to describe the relationship](http://imgur.com/SWwg7hP).\n\nEssentially, resistance limits the amount of current you can put into something (a circuit or even just a wire). Higher voltage will push more current through the same resistance (this is part of how the rapid chargers work, they use 9 volts instead of 5 volts).\n\nSo, getting a lot of energy into something really quickly means (by definition) very high power (power is voltage multiplied by amperage). Unless you have a superconductor (no resistance) you need very high voltage to push sufficient current through. High voltage and consumer electronics do not play well together.\n\nIn addition to that, some power will always be dissipated in a resistive circuit (non-superconductor). The amount of power is proportional to the current squared multiplied by the resistance. The more current you try to push through, the worse it gets squared. Dissipated power shows up as heat and heat gets things hot. Lot's of heat and consumer electronics do not play well together. ",

The only problem is that they just don't hold a sustainable amount of juice. Their discharge curve is measure in micro or milliseconds.",

            "comment": "You actually can charge batteries faster by applying more energy.  Too much and they explode.  Batteries are taking electricity and converting it into chemical energy, which is way better for storage.  Then converting that back when you want electricity.  Being a chemical reaction you can have some energy converted into heat.  Too much of that heat and it can react with the chemicals and start a chain reaction that converts all the energy into heat.  Then your phone is on fire, like a Galaxy note 7.  Shorts or other things that apply too much energy at once can trigger this.\n\nIn addition applying too much energy might not destroy the battery, but might slowly damage it resulting in lost capacity over time.\n\nSo most batteries have their chargers designed to charge them at a rate that doesn't risk them catching on fire or wearing out the battery to fast... unless you still have a Note 7.",

They don't have an infinite capacity for current and will blow up if you try this. \n\nWhat you're describing is only possible with capacitors which are purely electrical devices that hold power, but they have their own problems. Graphene capacitors look promising though.",

Lets take a typical phone battery of 3.7v/1 amp hour with 0.5 ohms of internal resistance and apply ohms law.\n\nIf we applied 4.2 volts to this to charge and the battery was already at 3.7 volts then the battery will consume 1 amp. (0.5 volt difference  / 0.5 ohms = 1 amp)\n\nIf the battery was completely dead at 3.0 volts then it would take up to 2.4 amps at the beginning. \n\nThe only way to speed this up is to increase the voltage which is dangerous for lithium or to decrease the resistance of the battery. Newer 'fast charging' batteries have a lower resistance and can charge/discharge quicker.",

            "comment": "No process is perfectly efficient, and batteries are quite bad about this. What this means in power technologies is that it creates unwanted heat with whatever waste energy it produces.\n\nWith something like a phone, the battery is designed to be small yet hold a lot of power. To charge it extremely fast would cause it to heat up very fast, faster than the phone can shed the heat. The heat then would damage heat sensitive components, or even cause solder to melt. It would destroy the phone.\n\nThe fact is, we have batteries that can hold a bunch of charge and charge/discharge very fast. But they invariably get very hot in the process, and with the kind of batteries used in phones, this can denature or even ignite materials inside the battery itself.\n\nLong story short, we COULD potentially charge a phone in a few seconds, if we could figure out how to make a battery extremely efficiently, or a phone (and battery, and hand) that could stand the extreme heat. Neither of these is likely so we're going to have slow charging phones from now till doomsday.",

You're dumping (electrical) energy directly into a fuel source under constraint (vastly simplified). I'm not going to cover dendrites or pits in the chemical makeup, as I'm not fully familiar with the topic.\n\nThe thing that makes current battery tech so static in evolution is that alternate solutions hold less charge, hold charge less well over time, or are more volatile (even more so than memetic Galaxy Note phone fires or firey vape rigs). Some awesome battery tech we've had in works for years like [glass batteries](https://news.utexas.edu/2017/02/28/goodenough-introduces-new-battery-technology) and [Li-S batteries](http://search.proquest.com/openview/584d3216ae339f6ce85edaa302164268/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=27576), but until they reach a comparable manufacturing process, prices will not be comparable (even if it's cheaper to source components).",

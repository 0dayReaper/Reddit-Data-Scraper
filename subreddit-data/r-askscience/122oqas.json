    "postText": "I'm wondering since during childhood your brain is developing and making lasting connections, if having depression problems during this formative time have lasting consequences for brain function that you wouldn't see so much in adults with depression (who maybe didn't as children). I'm thinking things like chronic fatigue, attention problems, executive dysfunction, etc. But I would be interested in seeing information on any lasting effects from childhood depression.",

But OP is asking a more targeted question, leading to something along the idea of whether or not evidence exists of childhood depression causing change in brain structure/chemistry/etc. that has effects in adulthood, and not necessarily just continued depression into adulthood (the example of a separate situation is given regarding the contrast to those adults who have depression but didn't have it as a child).  I wonder if there is anything in studies that can/has spoken to this.",

Like there are some basic developmental things that I had to learn late in life because of the depression (like learning how to talk to other people). And some things just never developed and I sometimes wonder if it\u2019s because my brain chemicals were out of whack during the time when the brain is typically learning that stuff (adolescence and puberty).",

Adverse Childhood Experiences cause \"toxic stress\" which leads to greater risk or incidence of poor physical and mental health.   I suspect that very few children suffer from depression that is not related to an ACE.  Children with a genetic predisposition to depression likely grow up in homes with high ACE outcomes, because their parents are likely similarly predisposed to depression or other mental health conditions.",

Ask a science question, get a science answer.

Rules:

Medical advice: Medical advice is strictly prohibited on AskScience. Asking for or giving medical advice are both against the rules.

Offensive or abusive language: AskScience has a strict policy against abusive and offensive language. Unless that language is in the context of research, it has no place here. We hold comments and posts to a high level of professionalism. We require our users and volunteers to always maintain a level of professionalism in order to participate.

Homework question: Homework questions are something that AskScience feels their experts should not be answering but instead should be answered by the person assigned the homework. While this is not always clear cut and is sometime up for personal interpretation, please report anything you believe to be homework.

Meme, joke, or just link: Memes, jokes, or comments consisting solely of a link are not allowed.

Top-level comment not answering the question: Top level comments (direct replies to a question, not a reply to another user's comment) must be an answer to the question posed, or a follow-up question to the post.

Nonreputable answer: Answers should be supported by reputable sources and scientific research. Do not cite yourself as a source.

Simple calculation or easily Googleable: If the question can be answered with a Google search, it is not appropriate for r/AskScience. Further, no simple calculations are allowed.

No bots, no AI generated answers:

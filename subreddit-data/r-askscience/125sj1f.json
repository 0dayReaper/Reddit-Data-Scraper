            "comment": "Dehydration synthesis and hydrolysis break down of muscle fibers uses and produces water. We aren\u2019t perfectly efficient and need the extra water. Additionally there quite a bit of waste produced that need water to transport it out. Ions like sodium, calcium, and potassium are also moving quite a bit and can dehydrate if you are pushing yourself.",

As your body replaces the fuels you depleted, water goes in with it to maintain the osmotic balance. Plus there are probably hundreds of other cellular processes activated that require water in some capacity.",

And then at higher doses more drug is available for it to bind to its next highest affinity the NET. \n\nYeah. K_i for SERT is 82nM, for NET it's 2480nM (2.48\u00b5M).\n\nThe story is similar for mirtazapine, except it binds to receptors rather than the reuptake transport proteins. Also it binds to H1 histamine receptors too, reminiscent of your quetiapine example, except even more potent (K_i of 0.15nM!). So very low dose mirtazapine can be used for insomnia the same way.",

            "comment": "Activity is entirely dependent on the concentration of free drug floating around in the synapse. If I have drug X, and it has activity at a dozen different receptors BUT a 10-fold greater Affinity at receptor Y compared to the other 11 receptors, than at a lower dose (say 10 nM) the only major activity observed will be at receptor Y. If I instead dose at 10-fold this (100 nM), there is enough free drug present in the body (brain if neuroactive compound) to elicit biological activity at not only receptor Y but possibly a handful of the other 11 receptors (imagine their Kd to drug X to be 100, 140, 165, 205 nM, etc.). Remember, Kd implies potency, or 50% of the concentration needed to elicit half maximal activity. You may not have half activity, but even 20% of the activity of additional receptors than Y may produce off-target effects in the brain.\n\nThis is why we do our best to make drugs selective. Many drugs at too high a concentration can result in undesired and even toxic side effects. It's also why you don't want to mix drugs that are metabolized by the same enzyme or impede the ability of that enzyme to metabolize drug X, even at 10 nM the extra time in the body might produce undesired consequences. We want to dose patients with just enough of the good stuff to produce the desired activity without undesired side effects o promiscuity in binding that could produce them. Hope this example helps.",

            "comment": "Mirtazapine does work on serotonin and norepinephrine, but through alpha2 antagonism rather than reuptake blockade like other meds you are likely comparing it to (NaSSA vs SSRI/SNRI). It is definitely considered unusual because lower plasma concentrations have higher affinity to histamine receptors (sedation) more so than serotonin (less sedating) and norepinephrine (activating), whereas increasing the dose causes the antihistamine activity to be overpowered by increased noradrenergic transmission. It depends on the person a lot too and the duration of use, since serotonin itself can be very activating for some, and after the first week people usually develop tolerance to the antihistamine effects. I can try to explain it in more depth or find you a research article if it still is not clear.",

            "comment": "Two main ways.\n\nConformational changes that cascade when there are higher concentrations. So if a certain receptor is constantly turned on, it will downregulate or upregulate other receptors using chemical messaging \n\nBut more commonly, some receptors only turn on at high concentrations. You can have receptors A, B, C, and D. A activates at the lowest concentration. D activates at the highest. Dopamine is a good example.

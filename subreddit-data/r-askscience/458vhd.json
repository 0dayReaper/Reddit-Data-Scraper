    "postText": "Hi everyone! We are *very* excited about the upcoming press release (10:30 EST / 15:30 UTC) from the [LIGO](http://www.ligo.org) collaboration, a ground-based experiment to detect gravitational waves. This thread will be edited as updates become available. We'll have a number of panelists in and out (who will also be listening in), so please ask questions!\n\n-----\n\nLinks:\n\n* [YouTube Announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7293kAiPZw)\n* [LIGO](http://www.ligo.org/news/media-advisory.php)\n* [Gravitational wave primer by Discovery](http://news.discovery.com/space/what-you-need-to-know-about-gravitational-waves-160210.htm)\n* [Gravitational wave primer by PhD Comics](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1853)\n\n-----\n\nFAQ:\n\n&gt; Where do they come from?\n\nThe source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). \n\n&gt; How fast do they go?\n\nGravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).\n\n&gt; Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?\n\nThe 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).\n\nIn 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.\n\n&gt; Does this mean we can control gravity?\n\nNo. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).\n\n&gt; What's the practical application?\n\n[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.\n\n&gt; How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (See limits on gravitons below!)\n\n-----\n\nStay tuned for updates!\n\nEdits:\n\n* The youtube link was updated with the newer stream.\n* It's started!\n* [LIGO HAS DONE IT](http://havewedetectedgravitationalwavesyet.com/)\n* Event happened 1.3 billion years ago.\n* [Data plot](https://scontent-yyz1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpl1/v/t1.0-9/12705573_10153931503438909_1455741693399938404_n.jpg?oh=ac0d075c0e24ade55e3c36b5aa89d681&amp;oe=57360AD8)\n* [Nature announcement](http://www.nature.com/news/einstein-s-gravitational-waves-found-at-last-1.19361).\n* [Paper in Phys.

The Michelson\u2013Morley experiment was done in 1887 to try and detect the differences in the speed of light in perpendicular directions, in an attempt to detect the relative motion of matter through the stationary luminiferous aether (\"aether wind\"). In 1905, Einstein published a paper first bringing up time dilation, which takes the speed of light as constant and deduces some weird shit that reality should conform to. During 1907-1915 he develops General Relativity, which explains how gravity plays into this. And now, in 2016, a 100 years later; the dude's scientific deductions are still coming true in exciting ways. And, hilariously, the idea of looking at light going in perpendicular directions is again the experiment being done, except with an entirely different outlook on what is expected. What's ironic is we can look at this now as \"listening\" to the \"ether\".",

To those in power the creation of gold was obviously the most useful element of alchemy so it was definitely the alchemist's meal ticket but for the majority of alchemists throughout history their motivations were much deeper. The creation of gold was a natural dual to the realization of gnosis in the spirit, a figurative gold (godlike) spirit from the lesser spirit of a human.  \n\nAlchemy is odd as it emerges in distinct cultures independently, and often shares similar themes that deeply tie into esoteric knowledge tracing back to the ancient Egyptians and beyond. Many alchemists (people like Robert Boyle, Tycho Brahe and Issac Newton are some ones you may know) gave us respectable scientific works on topics as far reaching as physics, mathematics and astronomy.\n\nIt could be said that alchemy *was* the science of the pre-scientific revolution era.",

The parallelism in alchemy has much to do with the European alchemists not being the originators. The name of the study and the names of some of our oldest chemical tools betrays this. The name alchemy is a combination of an ancient name for Egypt (khemi) and the Arabic word for the, Al. Like you noted the roots trace all the way back to experiments in Egypt. You can see a similar history in words like alcohol and and alembic. ",

The detector is designed to filter out frequencies much higher or lower that the expected signal region, so signals of this frequency are probably cancelled out by design.",

In the case of two inspiraling black holes, the amplitude is related to how hard they are accelerating in their orbit, and the frequency is related to the period of the orbit.\n\nThis is why inspiraling binaries have a gravitational wave 'chirp' - as they come closer in their orbit the frequency increases as they orbit faster and faster, and the amplitude increases as well. \n\nIf a wave passes through you, it will strain you a bit, effectively squeezing and stretching you. The amount of the squeeze is related to the amplitude, the frequency of the wave is just the frequency of the squeezing. It's this tiny wavey squeezing that LIGO was designed to measure.",

(Unless it can detect the miniscule acceleration of the airplane curving around Earth's surface as it cruises at constant altitude, or the acceleration noise of it moving through turbulence.)\n\nSo wouldn't this mean gravidar would be incapable of detecting things moving by at constant speed that most recently accelerated when they were a very great distance away, or accelerated very gradually?",

Imagine we have a very sensitive gravity wave detector and we place it near enough a tiny particle that it can detect it. Since it can detect it, it must be the case that the tiny particle is exerting a tiny gravitational force on the detector. But forces always have an equal and opposite! In this example the opposite would necessarily be the detector exerting a little gravitational force on the tiny particle, and hence altering the particle's momentum. \n\nOn the other hand suppose we have a detector that exerts no gravitational force... By the same argument of equal and opposite it follows that the detector will never be influenced by a gravitational field... And hence without any interaction will be incapable of detecting anything!\n\nThe principle of uncertainty can never be overcome since all interactions (things we can measure/detect) involve a two way influence between observer and observed.",

The machines have to be amazingly sensitive to detect even the most energetic events (such as the one presented today). The devices are huge, not because of any dissipation over distance, but because the scale of the wave itself is so miniscule. The larger the detector, the more amplified the signal will be. Kind of like how bigger telescopes see more light.",

The amplitude - the strength of the wave - comes from the masses, speeds, and Newton's constant G.  Mathematically, it's the rate of change of the quadrupole moment.  We can tell that radiation must be a quadrupole moment because changing monopole moment isn't allowed due to conservation of mass/energy, dipole moment can't change because of conservation of momentum.  So, we're left with higher order, and through GR we can find that it is in fact the quadrupole.",

Anything with mass/energy can create these waves, but since gravity is very weak only the most massive of objects produce detectable waves. We (currently) rely upon the fact that the speed of light is constant to detect gravitational waves on Earth. If a wave passes between our detectors, it will either stretch or compress the distance between two points, thus changing the total traversal time for a laser beam.\n\nThe detectors themselves are [laser interferometers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry) and are large L-shaped constructions with each arm extending for 4km. The US-based LIGO project has two facilities near Livingston, LA, and Richland, WA. The detector takes advantage of the phase change a gravitational wave will cause in a laser beam. ",

For instance, studying gravity waves from neutron star collisions can give us insight into the behavior of matter above nuclear densities-which only exists in their cores. This would in turn improve our understanding of the strong nuclear force- the only non-gravitational force that is currently not well understood at low energies. That would be huge! \n\nIn the future, we may be able to use gravity wave detectors like LISA to find out information about the population of more ordinary binary compact objects and single asymmetric neutron stars.  Future cosmic microwave background studies may find gravity waves that constrain inflation in the early universe (as BICEP tried but failed to do).",

General relativity describes gravity as a result of spacetime being warped due to matter. Gravitational waves are the ripples in spacetime that happen when you shake matter around. They are to the gravitational force what light is to the electric and magnetic forces.\n\nBut because gravity is much weaker than electromagnetism, we can see light all the time (just look around!) while we need to construct enormous lasers and incredibly (absurdly) precise detectors just to have even a hope of measuring gravitational radiation. Rumors are flying that LIGO, just such a system of lasers and detectors, has found a gravitational wave signal, probably coming from two black holes orbiting and falling into each other (because that's the sort of seismic event you need to make gravitational waves large enough for us to detect).\n\nThis would most likely confirm what we fully expect is there, rather than reveal something new and shocking about the Universe. Think the Higgs boson a few years ago. It would be a much bigger surprise if this radiation had turned out *not* to be there: general relativity has worked extremely well so far, and we have had indirect but extremely strong evidence for their existence since the 1970s, which won the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics. LIGO's *direct* detection would undoubtedly be Nobel-worthy, too; the only question is whether it would happen this year.\n\nThis is exciting because a) it's direct, rather than indirect, confirmation that these things are there, and b) they'll open up a whole new window onto the Universe. Pretty much the entirety of astronomy is done by observing electromagnetic radiation, from visible light to X-rays, the ultraviolet, microwaves, what have you. Starting now we'd have a whole other type of radiation to use to probe the cosmos, delivering us a brand new and pristine view of some extreme events involving ultracompact objects like neutron stars and black holes.\n\nSo all this will probably be announced at the press conference tomorrow, ushering in a new era of astronomy and physics. Or they could just be fucking with us.",

            "comment": "EDIT: Haha, I work at MIT and the professors who have to teach classes right now are really pissed, they want to watch the announcements!\n\nAs expected, there\u2019s already quite a bit of confusion and misinformation in this megathread, so I\u2019ll try to clear things up:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**What are gravitational waves?**\n\nIn order to understand gravitational waves, it\u2019s first important to have an understanding of how forces and fields work. We\u2019ll first take a look at something more familiar - the electromagnetic field. (note: this is simplified to avoid writing a textbook):\n\nThe electromagnetic field actually consists of 2 fields: the electric field (E) and the magnetic field (B). The electric field is generated by particles with *electric charge*, such as electrons (-1 charge) and protons (+1 charge). Here\u2019s a picture of the electric field generated by 2 such charges:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:VFPt_charges_plus_minus_thumb.svg\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs you can see in the picture, the convention is that electric field lines come *out* of positive charges and go *into* negative charges.\n\nIf you already have an E field and you put a charge in it, the charge will feel a force according to the simple relation (from Coulomb\u2019s Law):\n\nF = E*q\n\nwhere F is the force, E is the electric field, and q is the charge. This force has a direction - for positive charges it points in the same direction as the field lines, for negative charges it points backwards (since q is negative).\n\nNow, what does this have to do with gravitational waves? Well, let me ask you the following question: what happens if I have 2 charges, A and B, far apart from each other, and I suddenly move charge A?\n\n1) The E field changes instantly, with charge B immediately \u201cseeing\u201d the new position of charge A.\n\n2) The E field changes first at charge A, and then the change propagates outward until charge B \u201csees\u201d the change a while later.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nhttp://i.stack.imgur.com/gA6FS.gif\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAs you can see, the answer is 2. Changes in the electric field *radiate* outwards at a constant speed - the speed of light. In fact, this radiation IS light - our eyes are actually super-sensitive E&amp;B field sensors that pick up these ripples and translate them into images of the world!\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nMost importantly for our purposes, this principle of changes *radiating* outwards at the speed of light is **universal** for all fields and forces in the universe. Including gravity. The caveat being that the gravitational field is incredibly weak compared to the E&amp;B fields, so you need to have incredibly **huge** masses moving around extremely violently, and incredibly **sensitive** detectors to pick up their movements.\n\nThe biggest masses in our universe are Black Holes. The most violent events in our universe are black holes colliding with each other. And LIGO is the incredibly sensitive detector designed to detect them!\n\nWe\u2019re almost done! The last question is: what do we expect the gravitational waves to look like? And as a corollary, why do black holes collide in the first place?\n\nWell, most of the black hole collisions are going to happen in binary star systems - systems where you had 2 huge stars orbiting each other that at the end of their lives become black holes, still in orbit. But why would they collide? Why not just keep orbiting forever?\n\nWell, massive objects orbiting each other radiate gravitational waves. Those waves carry energy, and that energy has to come from somewhere - in this case, it comes from the orbital energy. So over a very long time, the orbits slowly collapse, the objects slowly orbiting closer and closer to each other. As this happens, the *orbital frequency* increases - the time it takes to complete an orbit gets shorter and shorter. This is a universal principle of gravity - if you look at our Solar System, you\u2019ll see that Mercury orbits much faster than Earth, while Pluto is much slower.\n\nSo, as 2 black holes spiral towards each other, we expect to see a **chirp** - gravitational waves increasing in frequency and intensity, rising in a final shriek as the black holes collide and merge.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**What is LIGO?**\n\nEven with black holes colliding to make gravitational waves, the ripples produced are still incredibly weak, requiring the ability to detect changes on the length scale of 1/1000th the diameter of a proton or less. So a very amazing detector is required.\n\nLIGO is basically an extremely sensitive distance-measuring device, called an interferometer. The way this works is the following:\n\nYou start with a laser beam, then you split it into 2 equal beams (typically using a half-silvered mirror that reflects 1/2 of the beam and lets the other 1/2 through) and send them down tunnels at 90 degree angles. When they get to the end of the tunnel they get bounced back by a mirror. When the beams return to you, you recombine them into a single beam and they *interfere*. Depending on how far each beam travelled, this interference can be either *destructive* or *constructive* - meaning the beams can either cancel each other out, or they can reinforce each other and get even brighter.\n\nAt LIGO, they designed the beams so that the interference is completely destructive, meaning that no light arrives at their detector. But, when a gravitational wave comes in, it distorts spacetime, changing the lengths of the beams, and they no longer perfectly cancel out! Thus, a light signal appears at the detector.\n\nI strongly suggest you watch the following video, which has a good visual representation of the process (around 1:30):\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzZgFKoIfQI\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**Why is this so damn exciting?!**\n\nSo many reasons! The incredible technical achievement - measuring changes down to 1 part in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. The long-awaited confirmation of gravitational waves, which is a HUGE deal in itself. Perhaps most of all, the fact that this opens up an entirely new method of astronomy, one that ultimately will allow us to probe the most extreme densities and energies that exist in our Universe! Finally, this result gives us some confidence that we\u2019ll eventually be successful in measuring the gravitational waves of the Big Bang, and learning about the fundamental origins of the universe.\n\ntl;dr - There are no real tl;drs in science, and why would you want one? It\u2019s worth it to try and understand cool things like this!",

As an analogy: if you used a microphone to record a distant gunshot's pitch and loudness, and you had a database containing the standard pitch and loudness of every bullet and weapon that could fire it, you could fairly accurately estimate the caliber of the bullet, the weapon it was fired from, and the distance away that it must have been fired. If you had two microphones, you could use the difference in time that the gunshot was recorded on each to estimate the general direction from which the bullet was fired. This is a gross oversimplification, but I hope it gives you an idea of how they came up with the figure of 1.3 billion lightyears.",

The set was part of LIGO's first observation period which continued until January 12th.\n\nIt's likely that they didn't even *get* the September 15th data (this event) until October 20th. They probably won't even budge on any information until the rest of the data comes in on Jan 12th and gets analyzed.\n\nIf it turns out similar wave forms come up every few weeks, it'd be a completely different finding. Best to wait until the whole observation period is up.\n\nOnce they get all the data, theres a lot of work to do just to get something useful out of it. Quite like finding a needle in a haystack, and noise filters are like magnets for assistance.\n\nOnce they have meaningful results, they still need to write the article and jump through the usual hoops for publishing.\n\nI'm actually impressed we're hearing about it this early.

By causing ripples through space time, aren't these gravitational waves not only changing the length of the metaphorical rod, but also *everything around it* including the very frame of reference of our reality? In that case, how did LIGO manage to detect the alteration in spacetime?\n\nFor example, looking at relativity and how gravitational fields affect time, there's a small difference in the passage of time between, say, a person on earth and a person in a satellite, but each of them perceives- and measures- that the same amount of time has passed, because their respective frames of reference are also affected, right? Why isn't something like that happening here?\n\nI feel like I'm doing a very poor job articulating my question here, but I hope one of you learned folks understand what I'm trying to say and answer my query.",

(The tumbleweeds should be mentioned [here](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/LIGO_web/98678news/98678han.html#Article_1), but the LIGO website is understandably under heavy load right now - Edit: [this article](http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0007050) is freely accessible and mentions them).\n\nSecondly, in the press release video, they stated they spent several months going through all the possibilities. So it looks like they've been thorough - it is a really big collaboration.\n\nI haven't been able to go through the details myself, because the paper isn't loading for me, but I feel I have a *lot* more reason to be confident about this result than I do about, say, the newly inferred planet.",

Most importantly, though, they have two sites, far enough apart that they can record the same event with enough of a time-difference to a) confirm the event was traveling at the speed of light, and b) get some idea of what direction it was coming from. The probability of seeing the exact same wave with the exact same waveform from random interference at two sites far away from each other at the exact right times for a propagating gravity wave is insignificant (you'll see such a thing once every 200,000 or so years, supposedly).",

The star would simply... disappear.  I know people at my department are/were looking for stars that did that, but I don't remember if they found any disappearing massive stars.  If that idea is true, it would provide a very neat explanation for these black holes being a few tens of solar masses.\n\nThere are a couple other ways you could do it too.  I know that models for very massive stars often involve the core collapsing to a proto neutron star, the star exploding, and then fallback later forming a black hole, but I think that usually just produces the 3 solar mass black holes you already mentioned.  Another way might be one star of a binary blowing up, and then the subsequent small black hole eats the other star, and then it meets up with another similar hole, but that's so wildly unlikely that I doubt it ever happens.  The LIGO finding would seem to indicate that these black holes are relatively common.",

    "postText": "This article about naval salvage drops a line about the quality of the steel in 1941 wrecks being particularly high quality in connection with the fact it was produced before nuclear tests and nuclear weapons use. Is there a scientific explanation to that or is thus just bad translation in and archaeological periodical?\n\nNot totally sure whether to tag this chemistry or physics since maybe it depends on the answer.",

            "comment": "As others have noted, it's not about the \"quality\" of the steel, per se, so much as its lack of exposure to (and inadvertent incorporation of) man-made radioisotopes spread by atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons. Steel produced from the mid-1940s onward is slightly radioactive. (Actually, all steel is very, very, slightly radioactive; there are some really trace amounts of naturally-occurring radioisotopes present even in pre-1940s steel.)\n\nThe steel from old warships isn't structurally stronger, or anything like that--it's just much lower background for certain very high-sensitivity scientific applications.\n\nOn a related note, we have techniques like [bomb-pulse radiocarbon dating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bomb_pulse), which dates biological specimens based on the relative ratio of radioactive carbon-14 to non-radioactive carbon-12.\n\n(Aboveground nuclear testing resulted in a massive spike in the level of carbon-14 in the atmosphere, doubling its concentration between about 1955 and 1963, when the US, USSR, and UK ended such testing. Looking at the amount of carbon-14 in tissues like tooth enamel can identify when the tissue was deposited.)",

            "comment": "The steel making process involves forcing air or oxygen through molten iron. The reaction between the oxygen and the iron produces steel. The air (in earlier production) or oxygen (in later production) comes from the atmosphere (i.e. the air around us), and carries along any background radiation. \n\nWhen atomic bombs were tested, they increased the amount of radioactive particles in the air for decades, and thus any air incorporated into steel also included radioactive particles. This low amount of radiation in the steel is not consequential for most uses, except when the steel is going to made into something like a Geiger counter (which detects radiation) or in advanced medical or scientific applications that are sensitive to radiation. \n\nSo this leads to your article. Pre-nuclear shipwrecks are often harvested (sometimes legally or not) because they are made of \u201clow-background steel.\u201d",

            "comment": "Okay so\n\npost-war steel vs modern steel there isn't really a difference anymore and the need for what is called \"low-background steel\" is rarely needed anymore.\n\nThe need for the two classifications came post atmospheric nuclear testing ban when the U.S., Soviet Union, and China tested nuclear weapons in the air using rocket-launched bombs.\n\nBecause steel at the time was manufactured using the Bessemer process which used raw air instead of the BOS process which uses pure oxygen. Because of the atmospheric nuclear testing radioactive isotopes contaminated the air used in the manufacture of the steel and so the steel itself was contaminated. \n\nmodern steel isn't at contaminated but still has a weak signature because some steel mills use cobalt-60 and thorium in welding.\n\nThe reason low-background steel was a necessity is that particle detectors not made with low-background steel were prone to false readings due to radioactive decay within the steel itself.\n\nit wasn't just particle detectors though, Geiger counters and radiation sensors were impacted also \n\nso it's not about the quality of the metal, just has to deal with contamination constraints",

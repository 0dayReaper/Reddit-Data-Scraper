            "comment": "The Oort Cloud is so far out that the Sun's gravity is extremely weak and the orbital velocities of objects are extremely slow (by orbital standards, anyway). This means that objects in the Oort Cloud can be easily perturbed by the gravity of nearby stars, and even tidal forces from the Milky Way itself. This keeps the orbits of bodies in the Oort Cloud from settling into a single plane.\n\nIt's hypothesised that there's another belt on the interior of the Oort Cloud, called the Hills Cloud. If this exists, it's thought to be much more planar.",

The mass density of the solar core is nearly ten times higher than gold. The distances being longer means smaller bodies are less-impacted, because they have less potential for gravitational attraction.\n\nYou can see this on a local scale pretty easily. Jupiter is huge. It has a lot of planar moons, much analogous to the planets of the solar system. It then has many irregular moons with orbits in any given direction and inclination. Those ultimately are close enough to Jupiter that they're highly unlikely to leave its orbit, but they're not close enough to the planet or other satellites to quickly planarize. That's our stand-in for the Oort cloud objects.\n\nAnd so when you take that cluster and look at the solar system as analogous to the Milky Way, it's easier to see why the Oort cloud doesn't become planar, and why the galaxy can be mostly planar.",

In the middle of that disc, net gravitational forces are such that anything that gets close enough will generally be stripped of its angular momentum (adding to the spin of the rest of the disc) and \"park\" there. And now with a roughly-stationary mass in the middle, more is attracted to the middle. And with more mass in the middle, *even more* is attracted inward. And so on.\n\nDark matter (whatever that term may mean, and possibly just gas or free particles) would certainly add to the mass, but it wouldn't change the core function.",

If dark matter indeed doesn't interact via collisions, then it should still be subject to basic losses of angular momentum via gravity. There's not a good mechanism to describe this.\n\nBut if it's the case that \"dark matter\" is instead the collective mass of a bunch of hydrogen molecules that are so distant (and impacted by net gravitational pulls from various directions) that they don't coalesce into clouds, then it could be an easy answer similar to \"it's basically like the Oort cloud\". And with the idea of it being just thin gas, it could definitely be that there's a significant mass of hydrogen or similar that stays roughly spherical and expelled far enough not to coalesce because of the aggregate \"stellar wind\" of star clusters and galaxies.",

                            "comment": "&gt; What are the tidal forces of the milky way?\n\nThe force of gravity depends on distance, it gets stronger the closer you are to the object and weaker the further away you are. The change in the force over difference is what we call a tidal force. In the Earth-Moon system, the Moon exerts a certain overall gravitational force on the Earth. However, the point on the Earth closest to the Moon experiences a slightly stronger force, which from the Earth's perspective looks as though it's being pulled towards the Moon, and the point on the opposite side of the Earth from the Moon experiences a slightly weaker force, which from the Earth's perspective makes it look as though it's being pushed away from the Moon (which is a bit counterintuitive since gravity is only ever pulling it towards the Moon, but since everywhere else on the Earth is being pulled towards the Moon with a stronger force, the *relative* force on that point points away from the Moon). The effect that this has is that it stretches the Earth slightly along the Earth-Moon direction (and conversely, squeezes it slightly in the perpendicular directions). This stretching, combined with the Earth's rotation, causes the tides.\n\nThe same principle applies to the Oort Cloud and the Milky Way. The parts of the Oort Cloud closest to the galactic centre experience more force than the rest of the Solar System, and the parts of the Oort Cloud furthest from the galactic centre experience less force, and this stretches the Oort Cloud slightly along the Solar System-galactic centre direction, and compresses it slightly in the perpendicular directions. It's only a very small effect, the Oort Cloud is still thought to be very nearly spherical, but over millions and billions of years this stretching and squishing is thought to be responsible for scattering objects from the Oort Cloud towards the inner Solar System, or out into interstellar space.\n\n&gt;Why is the hills cloud hypothesized?\n\nIt is only hypothesised, as far as I'm aware no objects in it have ever been directly observed, but the same is true for the Oort Cloud itself. We infer that it's out there by noticing things like comets whose motion indicates they must have come from very, very far out, but the sunlight out there is too weak and the objects too dark to be easily observable by telescope.\n\nThe idea with the Hills Cloud is that since the Oort Cloud is continually being perturbed by galactic tides and passing stars, it should be depleted of bodies by now. We don't expect this to be the case, because we still see objects that must've come from Oort Cloud-like distances, so the idea is that there's some inner cloud, and objects scattered outwards from this inner cloud end up in the Oort Cloud, and so keep it replenished. For this reason, you might think of the Hills Cloud as just being the inner part of the Oort Cloud, an inner, denser region that's close enough to not be depleted by galactic tides and passing stars, but far enough out that objects ejected from it might end up in the Oort Cloud. For this reason, you might think of it as just an interior part of the Oort Cloud rather than as a separate belt, and it is sometimes simply called the inner Oort Cloud.",

Also, because Fomalhaut is quite a young star, its rings are still I think largely comprised of dust, unlike the Solar System's belts. Over long periods, dust is blown off into interstellar space, captured by Poynting-Robertson drag, or conglomerated into larger bodies. Fomalhaut's rings are more like the protoplanetary disc that the Solar System had billions of years ago, from what I know.",

I haven't studied it for a while but I assume those get stripped out during the mergers etc. So you're just left with big clouds of stars that don't interact except via gravity, which I think is not sufficient for a disk to form ever again..\n\nI think with spiral galaxies the \"flatness\" comes first, similar to the solar system. I.e. you have just enormous clouds of dust and gas that slowly cool and collapses, forming into a disk. *Then* they start forming lots of stars, and become a spiral galaxy. Likewise the planets in the solar system formed from an already-flat protoplantary disk of gas and dust.\n\nI'll add though that I don't think these earliest phases of spiral galaxy formation have actually been observed yet, so it's kind of theoretical. I.e. there has been no observation of a spiral \"protogalaxy\", mostly because that is very far to look back in time. But if we're lucky then this is something that JWST might find! We *have* observed protoplantary disks though, there are some very cool images of those around.",

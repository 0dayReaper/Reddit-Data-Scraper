We have developed better ways of holding the \"active\" chemicals, and have improved the electronics and monitoring around the actual energy storage.\n\n*Humanity we - I have nothing to do with it!",

Small improvements in storage density and recovering or charging. But per weight it is like 18.6mah/gram on the Nokia battery and 22mah/gram on the iphone 13pro (rounded). Although the pro battery is a lithium polymer. So a dry gel coating on one of the electrodes. Allows odd shapes mainly.",

The expense and limited performance of earlier battery designs would not allow for the performance we see right now (yes cell battery life seems short as we're always charging our phones but that is because they use a lot more power now, batteries are better than the chonky batteries of early 2000s cells, for instance).",

New Li-ion packs have more capacity, weigh less, charge faster, and last longer.  Real world - driving deck screws with a Dewalt with 2 NiCad batteries, the batteries could not keep up.  New batteries last long enough/charge fast enough to do the job.",

Researchers are working on several battery types; faster charges, more storage and charge cycles, and lighter weight are all in the labs. \n\nindustrial scale will probably use different materials as weight isn't a problem.",

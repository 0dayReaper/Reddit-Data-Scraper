            "comment": "The CD4 site is a glycoprotein receptor found on the surface of some immune cells, such as T cells, macrophages, and microglial cells. It plays a role in the recognition of foreign antigens and the activation of immune responses.   \nHIV is not the only virus that can attach to the CD4 site. Some other viruses that can bind to CD4 include:\r  \n\\- Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), which causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and tropical spastic paraparesis. HTLV uses its envelope glycoprotein gp46 to bind to CD4 and also requires a co-receptor such as CXCR4 or CCR5. \r  \n\\- Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which infects various primates and is closely related to HIV. SIV also uses its envelope glycoprotein gp120 to bind to CD4 and a co-receptor. \r  \n\\- Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), which infects horses and causes a chronic wasting disease. EIAV uses its envelope glycoprotein gp90 to bind to CD4 and a co-receptor such as CXCR4 or CCR5. \r  \n\\- Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), which infects cats and causes a syndrome similar to AIDS. FIV uses its envelope glycoprotein gp95 to bind to CD4 and a co-receptor such as CXCR4 or CCR5. \r  \n\r  \nThese viruses are all members of the retrovirus family, which means they have RNA genomes that are reverse transcribed into DNA and integrated into the host cell genome. By binding to CD4, they can enter and infect immune cells and evade the host immune system.",

                            "comment": "Neither of the 2 active drugs in Truvada target CD4. Both target reverse transcriptase which is used by HIV to transcribe RNA into DNA, an enzyme that is not used by animals. All of these viruses do use reverse transcriptase though so the drugs do work on them.",

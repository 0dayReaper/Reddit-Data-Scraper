            "comment": "[Mid-ocean ridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge) are generally located in the middle of ocean basins because mid-ocean ridge spreading is typically symmetric. To back up, a mid-ocean ridge represents what originally started off as a [continental rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rift), something like the [East African Rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African_Rift) today. As extension continues, eventually the crust is thinned enough that mantle partial melting starts to occur, producing basalts and forming the beginnings of an ocean basin. This thinned crust, and the melting that occurs, tends to be broadly symmetric in cross section, e.g., [this diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-ocean_ridge#/media/File:Mid-ocean_ridge_cut_away_view.png). Thus, generally what we see at mid-ocean ridges is that the rate of oceanic crust creation is approximately the same on either side of the ridge. For example, if we imagine a north-south oriented, newly formed mid-ocean ridge, we would generally expect the rate of new oceanic crust being formed on the west side of this ridge to equal the rate on the east side of this ridge as well. So if this rate was X mm/yr, if we stand on the ridge, the plate to the west of us is moving away from us at X mm/yr and the plate to the east of us is also moving away from us at X mm/yr (and thus, if we stood on the west plate, the east plate moving is away from us at 2X mm/yr). With this symmetric spreading, geometrically, you're going to end up with a mid-ocean ridge that maintains a central position within that ocean basin as long as the only thing that is happening in that ocean basin is spreading (i.e., it's an ocean basin rimmed by [passive margins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_margin)). This broadly describes what we see in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nNow, if we look at [plate boundaries](https://geography-revision.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/plate-boundaries.jpg) globally, we can see that not all mid-ocean ridges are in the middle of ocean basins. For example, in the Pacific most of the mid-ocean ridge systems are more skewed to the east side of the basin. This reflects that the Pacific basin is no longer rimmed by passive margins, but instead by [subduction zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subduction) where the oceanic crust/lithosphere is returning back to the mantle. As a result, and depending on the relative rates of subduction vs spreading and the geometry of the margins, generally those eastern ridges are moving toward the eastern subduction zones over time. The evolution of these geometries and relationships since the break up of Pangea can be [visualized](https://portal.gplates.org/cesium/?view=AgeGrid), which can help kind of clarify what's happening in different places.\n\nFinally, it's worth mentioning that we typically consider mid-ocean ridges \"passive\" features in terms of their location. What this means, is that counter to kind of the common cartoon in secondary school Earth Science classes where mid-ocean ridges represent the rising limb of large convection cells in the mantle and subduction zones represent the downgoing limb of large convection cells, this is broadly not the case. Subudction zones are important in driving convection in the mantle and can be thought of as the downgoing limbs in a sense, but ridges are more passive cracks and the material sourced to form oceanic lithosphere through melting is quite shallow (effectively drawing from the [asthenosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asthenosphere) and very upper mantle), not deep upwellings (and thus their locations are not particularly fixed). If you want a deeper treatment, check out our [FAQ on drivers of plate motions](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/planetary_sciences/plate_motion_drivers/). As a result of their passive, non-fixed nature, ridges can also somewhat easily \"jump\", i.e., a mid-ocean ridge can shut off and reform in a new part of the ocean basin. There is a tendency (but not a strict requirement) for these to reform vaguely in the \"middle\" of basins, but really, where they form represents where the stress state in the plate as a whole favors the formation of an extensional system.",

                    "comment": "Ok this answer is amazing and it clarified a lot things to me and I realized that I have a lot of misunderstanding, but I have other questions:\n\nAs far as I understand, convection of the mantle is not responsible of the ridges, instead they create the subduction zones and crust at the other edge start to thin consequently until it's cracked and then new oceanic crust is formed, if this is correct, Why the subduction occurs is these specific places ? is it something related to the density of crust? I mean why for example there isn't covergent boundary in the middle of Africa? I don't if I'm being clear with my question.",

                            "comment": "Broadly only oceanic lithosphere is able to be subducted because of a density contrast. Specifically, subduction occurs and persists because a section of the oceanic lithosphere (including the crust and upper mantle) has reached a condition where it is denser than the underlying asthenosphere/mantle and thus starts to sink (in detail, the initiation of a new subduction zone is kind of complicated and involves a variety of processes, but the shallow level answer and reasoning is what I just went through). As another user indicated, density of oceanic lithosphere roughly correlates with temperature and thus age of that section of lithosphere (i.e., as a section of oceanic lithosphere moves away from a ridge, it cools, and gets more dense).",

I mean there wasn't continental or oceanic crust at thime or I think so, How subduction were originated the first time? Or we don't have information of that at present?",

                                            "comment": "The first crust/lithosphere to form was likely closer to oceanic than continental, but it was probably not what we would think of as oceanic crust/lithosphere today. As for how subduction got started, or more generally how plate tectonics got started, this remains a bit of an open question but there's some general ideas. Broadly, most models for plate tectonic initiation focus on convective upwellings and downwellings in the mantle as kind of an initial trigger either related to plumes (e.g., [Gerya et al., 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature15752)) or through more general mantle convection cells (e.g., [Capitanio et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0012821X19304479)) with both of these considering not just the induced horiztonal and vertical motions, but also the chemical changes imparted to the crust through melting and melt extraction (especially the Capitanio paper). Broadly, once you start to form, even discontinuous, pseudo- plate boundaries in the form of weak zones (that result from some of the processes discussed in those previous papers and others), models show that the development of a system of plates and full mobile-lid plate tectonics is not unexpected (e.g., [Bercovici &amp; Ricard, 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature13072)).",

                            "comment": "Density does play a large role in subduction. Typically as oceanic crust gets older it gets cooler and thus denser, not to mention it gets infiltrated with water and quite a lot of sediment is deposited on top (though the main factor is temperature). So dense slabs of crust have a far easier time subducting. continental crust is much lighter in comparison, and so while convergent boundaries between continents exist, the most famous being the collision between india and asia, they tend to make mountains as the crust piles up rather than sinks down.",

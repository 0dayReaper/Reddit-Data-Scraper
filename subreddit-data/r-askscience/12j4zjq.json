            "comment": "The radiated energy of a body depends on temperature.  In the simple black body radiation model there is a range of frequencies in a bell curve (like) shape.  As the temperature increases, (1) the central peak energy wavelength gets shorter so the photons have more energy, and (2) the total energy output increase so the the number of photons increases.  The bell curve moves to shorter wavelengths and gets bigger.\n\nA higher temperature star will look blue to humans, a lower temperature star will look redder.   Our Sun is in the middle so it's light is white.  This isn't a happy accident: our eyes have evolved here and are tuned to the available light.  If we evolved near a lower temperature star, our earth-human red might appear white/neutral and we might see into the infra-red electromagnetic region.\n\nGreen plants are a little weird. They use sunlight, but don't use all frequencies equally.  They tend to bounce out photons in the the central region of the spectrum, which is paradoxically at the energy peak.  That's photons that we see as green, so this rejected light makes leaves look green to us.\n\nThe reason plants reject green which is the peak energy has been a mystery for a long time but has been worked out recently.  Plants need to be extract energy in a low light conditions like cloud cover to survive.  However, they also need to \"make hay while the sun shines\" ie to work when the available energy is high.  This intense energy risks overloading chemical systems.  Their trick is reject the peak energy wavelengths, ie, green.  This keeps their systems stable in both high and low light conditions.    Life goes on.\n\nGetting back to stars, the wavelength mix that we see as green is not a black body color.  Green is white incident light with the central green area bumped up.  That's why there are no green stars: they are white.  Green light is a survival trick by plants, not a color of stars.\n\n\\[edit, missed part of the question\\] And the reason sunset is red is that the light has to pass through a lot of atmosphere to reach us at sunset.  The red light tends to make it through and the blue higher energy photons tend to get scattered sideways so less make the distance.  That's not really related to star colors.",

That puts out sun as \"white\" color.\n\nHowever, if you classified star colour based on their peak wavelength, our Sun is green.  If you collected a piece of our sun and put in a color matching machine at a paint store - our sun would be pop out a result of green.\n\nThe largest number of wavelengths coming from our sun are green wavelength. \n\nReason it doesn't look green to us is the sun also puts out other wavelengths, the atmosphere filters out blue wavelengths, and our eyes have 3 (or 4) color receptors that further filter away more blue light.",

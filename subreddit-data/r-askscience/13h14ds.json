            "comment": "This is ultimately a very deep question. The full answer requires you to get deep into the maths of quantum field theory, but as a rough description: particles are excitations in quantum fields, that occupy every point in space. Electrons are excitations in the electron field, and photons are excitations in the photon field. The rules of particle physics say that these two fields are *coupled*. That means that changes to one influence the other, and vice versa. Have you ever seen a [coupled pendulum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izy4a5erom8)? The motion of those two Creme Eggs is coupled - changes in one influence the other. That's why when you start one of them swinging, it causes the other one to start swinging as well. The same sort of thing is happening (but in a much more complicated way) between the electron field and the photon field. When the electron field changes, such as when an electron moves from an excited state to a ground state, it causes the photon field to change, and a photon is created. That photon can then go off, and if it finds another excitation in the electron field elsewhere, it will cause changes in that (which might mean e.g. scattering off an electron, or being absorbed by the electron and pushing it into an excited state).",

An electron changing energy levels doesn't really \"move\" in the classical sense. It's wave function changes, but you can't really assign a speed or acceleration to that kind of process in quantum mechanics. \n\nUltimately, spontaneous emission (like an electron absorbing and emitting a photon) is a quantum mechanical process (in fact, I believe you need the full field theory of quantum electrodynamics to completely describe it). Classical EM, like you described isn't able to describe that process.",

            "comment": "A photon is just a lump of energy, and the energy was already there.\n\nI don't think there is a good explanation for \"why are there photons\", but if you accept that there are photons, then they can come and go as needed, and that's just how they are. But this is not really satisfying to a curious mind. Maybe some of the mystery comes from not knowing what lies beneath the fact that there are photons, and I think I can help out with an analogy.\n\n\"Acoustic phonons\" are a kind of \"pseudoparticle\", which is, more or less, just a particle that we have some more insight into. We don't have to say \"it just is\", we can see why it is. Atoms in a solid act like masses connected by springs. If you wiggle some of the atoms, you can set up a wave of physical vibration, that travels through the solid. We know this wave as sound. However, the rules of quantum mechanics tell us that the total amount of energy contained in a wave is not continuous, it comes in lumps. Physicists have named the lumps of sound energy \"phonons\". On a microscopic scale, you really can count the number of phonons of sound energy in a sound wave.\n\nSo where do the phonons come from, when a vibrating object creates a sound? Well, they are just lumps of energy, and the energy was already there. Because we know a deeper theory of how sound propagates, that explanation is satisfying enough. But when it comes to photons, we so far believe they are fundamental particles, i.e. we have no deeper explanation of how they come into being. They just do.",

            "comment": "The photon is created. Particles can be created and destroyed. In these processes, energy conservation, momentum conservation, charge conservation and other things are all accounted for. \n\nWhere do the new particles come from? Well, that is kind of hard to say. I think that in Quantum Field Theory, each particle type is represented by a quantum field, and particles of that type are simply the excited state of that quantum field. But that does not really explain it on a physics level, it's just the mathematics behind it. The idea though is that the photons do not exist before they are released. You could say that the energy released during the de-excitation of the electron is converted into a photon.",

Are there any arguments against this?",

            "comment": "I think calling it an autoimmune disease is premature but there is an inflammatory hypothesis that says that most of the damage done is by chronically activated immune cells. In particular, the brain's resident macrophages called microglia. This has been gaining significant traction in recent years since we've been finding AD risk alleles in microglial genes (like TREM2). \n\nThe paper the article talks about postulates that amyloid beta is actually used by the body in response to infection as part of the immune system. It's definitely a possibility but we need more information before we can make any definitive statements. How come some people have essentially no amyloid beta detectable in their brains but are perfectly healthy? Wouldn't that suggest an immune deficiency? Why are neurons secreting this immune response instead of microglia or other cells?\n\nIts also important to note that this paper mostly used a neuron-like cell line derived from a cancer grown in a dish (SK-N-AS). It's a very useful tool but by no means should we be making field changing assumptions (eg amyloid beta accumulation can be good) without additional evidence.\n\nOriginal paper - [https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/trc2.12283](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/trc2.12283)\n\nOther hypotheses include the amyloid beta hypothesis which spawned the anti-amyloid antibodies like the recently approved Aduhelm (aducanamab), the tau hypothesis, the neurovascular hypothesis, the infectious hypothesis, and others. Most likely, none of these are 100% correct and none of them 100% wrong. The correct answer is somewhere in between but figuring out which pathway to target with drugs for therapies is really important which is why people fight over which one is 'correct'.\n\n**Declaring AD an autoimmune disease is premature** since we're still figuring out the role of inflammation in AD so its far too early to determine whether inflammation is being caused by autoantibodies, protein aggregation, neuroinfection, hERV reactivation, etc.\n\nNeuroinflammation and Alzheimer's disease: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-020-00435-y](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41582-020-00435-y)\n\nCompeting AD hypotheses: [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-019-0063-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-019-0063-8)",

It\u2019s an interesting article and it\u2019s great that we\u2019re looking beyond amyloid but I wouldn\u2019t call this article and the few papers it cites as conclusive evidence. \n\nConclusive evidence would be a mountain of numerous different types of studies done by different groups using different tools and methodologies showing the same thing. Think studies in model organisms, several observational studies showing lower/higher x measured at baseline is associated with lower Alzheimer\u2019s risk 10-20+ years later. Large studies in health record (e.g. medicare, VA, etc.) showing drug that does x is associated with lower Alzheimer\u2019s risk. The gold standard would be well run long lasting randomized clinical trials showing that drug or therapy x strongly lowered dementia risk years later in the entire overall treatment group and in treatment subgroups (e.g. people with APOE e4) without cherry picking and posthocing the data. Costly and time consuming, but we did this \u201call in\u201d for heart disease and cancer generations ago and made monumental gains.",

Well, humans have an enzyme called catalase that breaks down hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen. This is why you shouldn\u2019t put hydrogen peroxide on open wounds, because the bubbling you see is your body immediately breaking it down into water. In this circumstance it does nothing to any bacteria. \n\nHuman saliva does have catalase, but not at the same concentration as human blood. So this also decreases the anti microbial activity of the hydrogen peroxide. \n\nThere are some bacterial species that also have catalase, but *Streptococcus* doesn\u2019t. It does have different enzymes (varies by species) that do the same thing, so all or most species of Strep are completely immune to hydrogen peroxide damage. \n\nAdditionally, using very potent mouthwash (such as alcohol based mouthwash) is generally bad, because you need your microbiome to protect from the unwanted bacterial species. Your mouth is full of bacteria that is helpful or neutral, and you don\u2019t want to kill those off or else you make an environment that\u2019s even more suitable for colonization by the pathogenic species of bacteria. \n\nSome examples of this are *Streptococcus salivarius* or *Streptococcus sanguis*, which are both commensal species that colonize the oral cavity. They produce anti microbial compounds that kill pathogenic species. They also physically take up space and nutrients from the environment, which can prohibit pathogenic species from growing there. So you definitely don\u2019t want to sterilize your mouth by using an alcohol based mouthwash, because you need the commensal species. \n\nBasically, there\u2019s a lot of bacteria that are immune to hydrogen peroxide, and the human body neutralizes it as well to prevent cell damage. But even if it was adequately killing the microbes, that\u2019s generally not a good idea either. The best practices are to brush your teeth using fluoride toothpaste, as this can inhibit bacterial growth but doesn\u2019t attempt to sterilize. It also removed the acids that cause cavities. You should also floss to keep your gums healthy so that there is no direct passage from your oral cavity into your bloodstream.",

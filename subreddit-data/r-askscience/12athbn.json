            "comment": "Ice in vacuum will sublimate rapidly until it cools to about -70 C. There's still some sublimation (vapor pressure is never zero) but the colder you get the slower it is. This is how icy bodies in the outer solar system continue to exist. See also: the concept of the frost line in astrophysics, the distance from the sun where ice can exist in space for a reasonable amount of time.\n\n[Shackleton Crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shackleton_\\(crater\\)) near the south pole of the moon maintains a brutally cold -183 C. The moon has low axial tilt, and the sun is never high enough in the sky here to shine into a handful of dark craters. They are sometimes called pits of eternal darkness.\n\n[There may be some additional ice trapped in shadowed lava tubes.](https://www.space.com/39404-lava-tube-skylights-discovered-moon-images.html) Nobody has an equally ominous catchy name for cold dark lava tubes yet. Tube of eternal darkness?\n\nScientists know quite a lot about Shackleton from impact probes. The pits gather other materials that sublimate during daytime on the moon such as ammonia and mercury, and the ice is mostly covered by and intermixed with lunar soil.",

            "comment": "[Here is a calculation of the sublimation rate](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/PSJ/abb6ff). For a temperature of 110 K they get a sublimation of 144 kg/(m^2 * Gyr), which means the ice loses a thickness of ~16 cm per billion years. It's such a slow process that they couldn't measure it, they measured it at higher temperatures and then extrapolated.",

The vibrational energy of a material having *a* temperature is always a distribution of energies, and atoms at the surface sometimes fling themselves loose.\n\nRelated: in a vacuum, metal can grow 'whiskers' as atoms jump but don't quite escape their metal surface and recrystalize in new positions. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisker_(metallurgy)\n\nClean, bare metal parts will also weld together when they touch too firmly in a vacuum under some circumstances, too...\n\nThe silica gas from the vapor pressure of basalt on the Moon is trapped by the Moon's gravity and probably in equilibrium with the surface at the current 'pressure' plus solar wind probably adding and removing far more mass constantly.",

On one hand you don't need to weld on the other you have to be careful how you store your assembly components.",

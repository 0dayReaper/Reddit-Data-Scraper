    "postText": "My ex has depression and we broke up yesterday. I spent around 8 month\u2019s supporting him and told him a couple days ago if he didn\u2019t get help soon I would have to walk away. He outright told me he wouldn\u2019t get help and he doesn\u2019t want to speak to me anymore. We called and he didn\u2019t sound like the person that I fell in love with, let alone one that even cared about me. \n\nWhy would he avoid help if his depression has been spiraling for almost a year now? And I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019d treat me like this after all my support, even if he is depressed.",

            "comment": "Personal experience with my own depression. It can make a person doubt their self worth. It can cause severe guilt. Make a person feel like everything they have ever done is bad. Failing just once, in just one area can make them feel like a total failure. The negative emotions one experiences with depression are so powerful, much more so than the fleeting positive emotions a depressed person might feel. Those don't last, they fade quickly. The pain on the other hand, the darkness, is sure to return. It becomes its own drug. We know what to expect, and it never disappoints. It is always there waiting for us, a true friend.",

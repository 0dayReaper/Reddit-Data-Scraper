    "postText": "I have a beautiful life. I have a loving family, a good deep friend group, and a brilliant, wonderful girlfriend. I am successful academically and athletically. I have interests and hopes and dreams still, so I'm not so deep down as some. I love my family, and I turned down a lot of scholarship so that I wouldn't spend the next decade+ away from those I love according to that career path. I am admired and loved by people around me. But I'm so frequently miserable.\n\nAt the beginning of last year I started to get very anxious about college decisions and by the end of the school year I believe I had become depressed, getting to the point of suicidal ideation half a year ago. I have so much good around me and I just feel like I can't respond enough to it. I don't believe I can ever live up to my talents and all the good around me and what I want to achieve. I feel like I'm setting myself up for failure by constantly overestimating myself. Rest is not restful and I can't focus on anything I'm trying to do. I keep telling myself that I don't need to share how I feel because I'll be supported whether or not I do, but them knowing would have them concerned for me. I know it isn't rational, and this post feels so shallow compared to others, which is another problem. I cannot stop comparing myself. Last summer was hellish to me. I wasted so much time and I regret so much and I'm trying to make up for it, but this summer is already going in much the same direction. I'm just doing more so now I'm more anxious about the present than the future. And then I'm still scared for my future, overthinking my college choice and whether I can make it through if I keep going down this road. I'm ashamed for feeling this way among so much goodness. I don't deserve it and I wish I didn't have it. I loathe it and I wish I didn't exist like this.",

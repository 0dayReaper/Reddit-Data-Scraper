    "postText": "I can\u2019t help but feel cold, dark, and alone day after day. I can never sleep and at the same time I can never stay awake. Thoughts from the past keep coming back, and when I\u2019m on my meds my past invades my dreams and forces me to remember it when all I wanna do is forget. People always tell me the same bland things they always do to try to make me feel better and I\u2019m beginning to want the dead silence again. I\u2019m just exhausted. I keep thinking I have no more fight left in me, but I find myself still here and I have no answer for it as to why. I\u2019m just tired, and I wanna be done, except my mind won\u2019t let me. I\u2019m so emotionally absent I can\u2019t even relieve my pain through crying and I hate it. Nobody\u2019s ever really been there for me like I\u2019ve always been for others, in fact people are always doing me more harm than good and I know my judgement isn\u2019t THAT bad that I\u2019m seeing the good in people when it isn\u2019t even there. \n\nI can account for numerous times I was stronger than I should\u2019ve had to be, helped others, it once too me 9 1/2hrs to talk someone else out of suicide while I was having my own problems, I almost never think about me, but I always tell people \u201cthink about you\u201d, my back breaks for those I love and care about, and it can always break some more whenever they need me. \n\nI\u2019m just not sure what to do anymore, I\u2019m rotting from the inside out and letting it happen. And I unfortunately just don\u2019t care anymore\u2026I haven\u2019t cared in years.",

Weed suppresses dreams so I don't have to worry about waking up in a cold sweat anymore. Also brings down my anxiety so I'm not dwelling on things which helps to silence the voice of doom.",

But I\u2019ll definitely look for that book, anything helps right about now. I very much appreciate what you\u2019ve had to say so far. And I\u2019m happy to hear you aren\u2019t down in the dumps anymore.",

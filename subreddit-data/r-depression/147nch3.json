I\u2019m trying to cut down on drinking but every time I try I just end up back at it again, honestly I feel like it\u2019s become a coping mechanism because my life isn\u2019t so great. Any tips on how I can go about this?",

            "comment": "This will happen. Its alcohol's effects on the brain. Most doctors will assess alcohol when someone presents with depression because it is a leading factor. I would try to cut down drinking or speak to your doctor about help with cutting down. \n\nWhat else do you derive joy from? Try to replace alcohol with something else you enjoy. When you have a few weeks alcohol-free my guess is you'll see a difference in your mood which may motivate you further. \n\nAlternatively you could try reducing the amount you drink when you do drink. Try to alternate alcoholic drinks with soft drink. Have a beer, have a coke , have a beer, have a coke etc. This way you're still drinking but less and hopefully you'll notice a difference in your mood. \n\nThe most important thing though is really to reach out to your doctor and talk to them. You may be self medicating and not even realise it. Consider talking therapies if possible and don't forget to ask for further advice on how to cut down alcohol. \n\nFinally, you're not alone in this. This is a common problem. Please just give yourself that little push to help yourself before it worsens. \n\nTake care friend.\n\nEdit: typos.",

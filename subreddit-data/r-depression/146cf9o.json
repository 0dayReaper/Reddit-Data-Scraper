    "postText": "Well, to start off, my junior year of high school is over, which gives an ease on my anxiety so I\u2019m at least grateful for that. Of course, for me I will just be rotting away in my room for the entire summer. Obviously, this is the kind of quiet time I look forward too after a long ass year. However, there\u2019s the towering feeling of loneliness when my friends are all out with their girlfriends and I\u2019m inside trying to stay away from people at all times, which includes my parents but I\u2019ll get into that later. Anyways, being out in public itself just gives me an immediate anxiety spike. If you see those memes around that joke about people being afraid to even ask for directions or even pay at the cash register, that\u2019s me, I\u2019m one of those people. I\u2019m not schizophrenic or anything, but I can definitely tell people just take one look at me and are disgusted and laugh at me. I want to get a job this summer, which I\u2019ve already applied for, and I\u2019m already getting headaches about how the hell am I gonna do this when I\u2019m obviously terrible with people? Yet at the same time, I\u2019m 17, and by now I should have a job and with a family full of out of touch boomers and older gen x assholes I\u2019m always being made to feel like I\u2019m a weak sack of shit for not having a job at this age. My parents, whom wonder why I never want to be by them or talk to them, constantly spew racist bullshit and bigoted conservatism. Now, this only adds to my depression and anxiety because I am a very far left individual and they don\u2019t know that because I used to be a conservative like them and obviously I\u2019ve changed. What makes me upset the most is when they are racist/homophobic/transphobic right of front me as if they are trying to get me to say something. But I can\u2019t say anything because I don\u2019t want to be disowned. What other choice is there than rotting away and talking to myself? I can\u2019t just go to a therapist because my parents would want to get involved and berate me for being \u201cungrateful\u201d. Having to sit in silence and hear them say these hateful things makes me not want to exist anymore. I just want to know if somebody out there is facing a similar experience as me and would be willing to leave some helpful words please do because I can\u2019t take it anymore.",

Try to go outside and do something fun and be in an environment that you feel comfortable in and work from there.\n\nThis might be vague but it is what helped me",

I can recall so many times when I would just be minding my business and a grown adult would say something negative to my face or about me. Like for example, some friends were over at a neighbors house. They were having a pool installed. One girl stepped over a piece of equipment, I was literally about to do the same when the mom yelled \u201cno go around.\u201d I will never forget the look on her face when she said it I was horrified. Also to mention the other girl that didn\u2019t get yelled at for doing that was white. I am black. When she did that everyone looked at each other knowing that the only reason she did that was because I was the only black person there and it was wrong. A couple minutes later her husband comes out and he was always super nice to everyone. He just said that everyone try to stay out of the workers way. That should have been what she did but she didn\u2019t. \n\nYears later she wants to be all buddy buddy with me only because she learned that my dad died when I was young. Old rude women. That\u2019s why your super nice husband divorced you and your son wanted to live with him instead of you.",

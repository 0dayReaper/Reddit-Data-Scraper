    "postText": "I used to try to feel better by thinking of the things that amaze me when I had nothing left but this passion. I wanted to live to be able to create beautiful stuff, to enjoy what I made and what others made. For all the exciting books, games and movies that are out there and that I haven't yet discovered.\n\nNow I can't love people anymore, I don't enjoy their company. I don't want to live to see better days. I don't even want to lay forever. I don't want to exist at all.\n\nThe happy moments after I encounter a beautiful piece of art are fleeting. I drag myself through the day. I find myself scared to fall asleep because then another day will star and I will have to get up and do something all over again..\n\nI'm too much of a coward to end all of this. It's the only reason I'm still alive. I know it will never go away. So please, could you share what makes you live still?",

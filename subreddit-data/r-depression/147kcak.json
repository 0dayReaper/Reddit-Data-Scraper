    "postText": "I made this post before but not much has changed.\nLong story short. From about 17-18. Maybe 19 I became extremely depressed. \nI\u2019ve always felt lost and depressed but I had sixth form/school/university to at least keep some discipline in my life and socialise hence allowing me to feel better.\n\nI\u2019ll try summarise my situation/life as best as I can:\n\n1. I am not mentally strong. I try my best but somedays/sometimes I feel completely defeated and hopeless. I\u2019ve lived with my mum whom suffers from PTSD and severe mental depression.\n\n- can\u2019t cook for herself sometimes.\n- Randomly has outburst and can just overall be negative.\nLove her to bits but I\u2019ve told her obviously if this is what I\u2019ve been seeing for years it\u2019s going to \u2018rub off on me\u2019 a bit.\n\n\nI lost contact with my dad for a few years (they had a case together - both parents) it was overall just a bad situation and definitely affected me a bit.\n\nMother lost some benefits and privileges due to losing the case\n\nI am okay with my dad now but he can\u2019t see what he can do for me.\n\n\n\n* I feel I need to read or do things to build  mental strength and discipline. I know for a few months or years it may be a struggle or \u2018harsh\u2019 but I need to learn to be positive about that. \n\n2. Finances. Are poor. Don\u2019t have any real savings. Currently I\u2019m working a 39 hour job contract that pays about 10.52 an hour. \nJob is fine. But it\u2019s quite meaningless and I\u2019m not gaining any real directed / specific experience.\n\nHowever like I said I\u2019m trying to pull myself out of a terrible position and understand the importance and discipline of doing things I \u2018may not like\u2019 \nJust to be stable again. Like I need to work regardless whether I like it or not.\n\n* I do want to move out. So I\u2019m trying to use this motivation as best as I can to just constantly work and save.\n\nODD confessions: I also lied about getting a bachelors on my CV and still have some jobs I\u2019ve never actually worked in there. Should I remove these?\n\n\n\n3. Slight Insecurities: I lost hair badly around 16-21. I tried everything but to no avail works - I definitely don\u2019t care as much but it did strip a few years off of me.\nI stopped going out. Missed a lot of opportunities and friends birthdays etc.\n\nI DO regret this and do wish to get better so I at least have some friends left in my life (I don\u2019t know how important this is)\n\n- Physical Appearance. Don\u2019t really like it but I understand I need to get in the gym etc. \n- I\u2019m not fat or overweight anything but just don\u2019t like how I look. \nI understand I need to go gym but I have a slight anxiety about it.\nI do plan to go soon.\n\n4. Lack of direction and knowing what to do.\nAs mentioned before I haven\u2019t worked much jobs that are substantial or specifically targeted in a particular field.\nreasoning why is I still don\u2019t know what career path or profession i wish to take on.\n\nI somehow wander within the thoughts of being a therapist or counsellor.\nI may start trying to work jobs as careers etc or try find an trainee course / internship for this type of field\nOr don\u2019t know if going back to university would be a viable option.\n\nI already went university but didn\u2019t finish my course so would be tripling my debt.\n\n\nEmbarrassing (maybe) confessions.\n\nI\u2019m 23. And have PIED (Porn Induced \nErectile Dysfunction)\n\n- I use Viagra (100mg) to combat this.\nI\u2019m 23 and my self conscious has been eating me up about it.\nI have a girlfriend I love her but feel she\u2019ll definitely not be with me if I can\u2019t pleasure her in the long run.\n\nShe claims she doesn\u2019t care and can go years without sex / stay with me until I recover but I just don\u2019t believe women these days.\nThis isn\u2019t too important it\u2019ll hurt to lose her but if I better myself maybe with time we can be reunited / never know what will truly happen.  \n\nI\u2019ve seen a doctor multiple times. Said it\u2019s fine to use just not too often and try to stop in the future.\n\nRecently I got a UTI for the first time in my life and don\u2019t know if it\u2019s related to my use but I\u2019ve been using for years and haven\u2019t had this before.",

    "postText": "I feel like my depression took my entire teen years from me. I spent all my free time in high school crying and self harming at home while everyone else had friends and hobbies and went to parties. Then I did the same thing in college. I didn\u2019t even move out from my parents house because I was too anxious to stay in a dorm. My ex used to tell me about how much fun they had in high school and how they were in a bunch of clubs and how they had the most fun in college staying in dorms with all their friends and doing fun, dumb stuff. It always destroys me to think about how I missed out on all of that because of something I couldn\u2019t control. Now I\u2019m 21 and just graduated college and I\u2019m lost. I have no friends, no partner, no job, me and my family are on rough terms and I just got diagnosed with anorexia. It is just crushing me and idk what to do anymore. And I\u2019m afraid to tell anyone because I don\u2019t want to be sent back to a psych ward since I have no money to pay for it again. I\u2019m just so broken right now. Can anyone relate to this crippling regret of missing out on what were supposed to be the best years of your life?",

I kept telling my self that it would get better, but it has seemingly just gotten worse over the years. I don't know fam, going to a therapist soon... Fingers crossed. What's your plan?",

If you don't thinks it's helping, another therapist may be the solution? If that's a possibility",

It does what it does mostly by convincing you that it's not worth it to try, that failure is inevitable and you're worthless, so may as well shortcut past the trying and get right to failing. It's insidious like that, because it creates a self-reinforcing cycle that can be very difficult to pull out of.\n\nBut just remember - it's lying, and lies don't have power over you unless you let them.",

You have anorexia but you also have the potential to gain weight and to be a healthy person now that you know it. Understand what are your problems and why knowing them isn't going to pull you back but it is how you can see your potential and the things that you have to do now. See all the goods in your life and accept the bad things and the past. You are not alone we are here to hear you and i am ready to talk to you about whatever you want just look at your future for now you have so much to do now.  Leave the past in the past it is hard to say but when someone ask you how was your highschool years just say awful or say it is so far i barely remember it with a joke and that's how i deal with it so try it . Idk if my message was clear but all i want to say is give your present and your future a chance so they can be your new past.",

Early teens I was dealing with trauma so I dissociated a lot and isolated a lot, then later on depression creeped in along with psychosis and before I knew it, I was no longer a teen :/ it sucks I think about it a lot, I wish I could do something to change it but I can't. Trying to accept it is hard as well. I'm in college rn and it's corona time so I'm not making friends but at least I can blame it on that instead of social anxiety lol. Anyway I'm not in your situation but I can relate to it to an extent and it's hard. Idk if it helps but sometimes I tell myself that I also missed out on pretty bad things as well...\n\nYour life is not over and you're not alone",

Honestly I like to learn the hard way bc I have such a bad problem with fear of missing out. But I just don't have the energy to process everything the \"right way\" like I'm allowed to do things the easy way! Sooo I signed myself up for Thai boxing lessons, I went to bars by myself and concerts. It sucks and feels lonely.... But also, YOU can give YOURSELF the things you never had. And that was pretty empowering to feel. I don't have stories of those young years, but I've made it a point to try to do the things I want to do now that I'm in my 20s. It also helped to just wait it out. Some things just have to be healed by time and this sadness of missing out is one of them for me. I'm trying to be less judgemental, and to talk to people and not be jealous but to use it as a frame of reference for things to put on my bucket list. Also, people TOTALLY hit their stride in their thirties. I was worried I would be severely depressed for half my life and decided if I wasn't better I'd kill myself but like... My thirty year old friends have their shit together and my twenties friends are figuring out their shit and man I like these people more than who any of us probably were back then. I had issues, there's no way to deny that or change it, but I truly believe it's awesome to be an adult, and way better than to be a youth with all the personal development that hasn't happened yet.\n(Until the next time I'm particularly lonely or depressed. But my point still stands and I stand by it. So in the end, you just keep trying to build a life you want for yourself and wait it out \u2764\ufe0f)",

Although I feel I have overcome a lot I look at all my friends getting married, having babies etc and I know it could have been me too if I had just gotten my shit together sooner. I felt a disconnect with my best friends who I have known since I was a kid. So many relationships I fucked up bc I couldn\u2019t get my head right... then I saw a great post a while back, not sure if it was this sub but the gist was that you owe it to the different versions of your past self to live the life you deserve. \n\nYou owe it to that self harming teen to love yourself and take care of your body. \nYou owe it to that anxious lonely college kid to put yourself out there and make some friends and start dating. \nYou owe it to that \u2018crazy\u2019 mental patient to take your mental health seriously and really \u2018do the work\u2019 and/or ask for help. \nYou owe it to that broke loser to be confident and proud of your abilities and keep or start applying to jobs, even the ones you think you aren\u2019t qualified for. \nWhat ever horrible thing you think of yourself in the past, you owe it to that self to choose to be different, to build that dream life, that dream self that you think you would have been if only you shoulda woulda coulda. When you do you will appreciate and cherish every moment, even the drama and the pain that will certainly come with it. \nAnd I can confirm, that OP was right. I feel like it fixed that last part that was just knocking around in my head. After 7 years being broke and doubting myself and my choices, and 9 months of rejection I nailed an interview and landed a job making almost $100k/year. And I\u2019m moving in with my boyfriend and out of my moms now that I can financially contribute. I know that probably sounds too good to be true, trust me I could pinch myself. Whenever I get anxious they\u2019ll discover I am a fraud or I\u2019m going to find a way to let my depression fuck it up like I always do, etc I remember I owe it to my past self to be the person I want to be and live the life I want to live. The OP was much more eloquent, but hope that helps you like it helped me!",

Basically, the last 8+ years are like a quick timeskip or nothingness - at least nothing one is supposed to do, like getting friends at school and socialising... instead, that time was lonely... it's sad and it's a waste of potential.\n\nHey, look at the bright side. You are 21 and got a college degree. That is more than most have. I started uni when I was 19 and now I'm 23 and have written two exams so far, want to switch subject and my degree is far ahead of me still (I felt completely lost in life. Yeah, it's a shitty and diabolic little vicious circle...).\n\nYou're so young and have graduated. Now you can start building your life up from here on. Look to get a job in your field to earn money and gain experience whilst having something to do. Most other things will come with time. You still got your whole life ahead of you and so do I. I know this sounds easier than it will be, but trust me, just try to move on step by step for now and you will eventually get there, slowly but steadily. Try to not look back - because you can't change past now anymore, you can only change the future. And by looking back you have nothing to gain, but you have the potential of losing out on your current life. Try to avoid these sad thoughts and instead focus on the present and look forward to what lies ahead, then you will be glad to change your to-be-past for the better!\n\nAll the best to you, OP.",

I also feel like I'm \"past my best years\" so often, and for the love of god wish to not age any further, and then I suddenly realize that I'm actually not even that old yet. Even if my back tells me otherwise... ^^'\nI think we always criticize ourselves much more than others do. What helps me sometimes is trying to have a look at myself \"through the eyes\" of other people I know, trying to think about how they're probably viewing me and what they think about me. I tend to be an extreme overthinker of just about anything and sometimes this really helps realizing that mostly, thankfully, things aren't really as complicated as I think they are, and that others are probably judging me far less than I fear they do.\n\nOne of the good things that came with the last few years of loneliness for me was that I had a lot of time to think about things. Things like life itself, my life, the lives of others, people in my life, friends, family, careers, hobbies, relationships, expectations, interesting questions, purpose, what my plans and purpose in life are, science, philosophy, nature, the universe... anything, you name it.\nAnd one of the lucky discoveries I've made along that path (and also got that advice from other sources afterwards) is that one of the core things that make us sad is comparing our lives to those of others, and adopting someone else's expectations or following them. Everyone has their own life and the right to lead if it the way they want. Optimally, nobody should feel like a loser because they're not doing something that others are doing, or vice versa, but sadly, many people do. (Which is one of the ways of how social media can cause big harm to someone's mental health).\n\nFind something for yourself that makes you happy and don't listen to others telling you otherwise :)\n\nAt the end of the day the only thing that really matters is that we should do ot try our very best to enjoy every day of our lives as much as we possibly can, and if there are sad days among the good ones then that's perfectly normal. That's what makes life what it is. If there were absolutely no up's and down's then it would just be a flat line.\n\nNow I hope that this wall of text doesn't come across as annoying anything like that xD",

You can change everything around you and it starts with getting help. Apply to jobs, meet new people and that's the only way forward. You need to stay positive. That's the key and start developing a routine. Obviously, this pandemic isn't helping but stay strong and keep your head strong. If you were able to get through college depressed like I did then you've shown enough grit and preserance, now you just need to keep at it. Friends come and go. You'll meet new people and experience new things. Don't feel so down because of that. Lastly, let's be real here we all go through up and downs. For you and me we both went through depression throughout college, but college is only one part of life. There is still so much ahead!!!",

I was an extrovert so being stuck inside unable to work or socialize and in constant pain I became really depressed and suicidal. I'm 34 now still in pain and depressed. Thankfully the suicidal thoughts are gone after several years of counseling and medication.  My wife divorced me in 2013 because of it. I'm not as close to friends because I can't go out and do things. I missed out on my 20's and I'm missing my 30s. So yeah it's very hard knowing my life is wasting away. I no longer have confidence and my life is forever changed. My counselor made a good point that the way I was is dead so it's normal to grieve. She feels some of my depression now is grieving who I once was and the loss of all that time. I want nothing more to be normal. Go to work, socialize, get in a relationship again. I can't do the first 2 since I'm always in pain physically and mentally. As far as a relationship goes where am I supposed to meet someone since I'm stuck inside most of the time? No girl would want to date someone without a job, depressed, in pain unable to go out on dates or adventures. \n\nKind of went on a small tangent but yeah I do get extremely sad. You aren't alone with that. I wish you the best.",

I\u2019m 30 now, and can easily say my fondest memories started about the time I turned 21. I was old enough to drink, travel on my own and making my own money. High school sucked for me, I barely remember it, honestly. In college I was too stressed about school or depressed to worry about making friends. Working in restaurants really brought me out of my shell. Restaurant crews, at most places, are really bonded &amp; close. Now it definitely wasn\u2019t ideal for building healthy habits (partying, no sleep, work-relationships/drama), but it certainly is a place that brings together a lot of different ppl all with the same goals...To make money, get through the shift and blow off steam afterwards. I made some of the best friends and had the best times working in restaurants/bars after high school &amp; college. I\u2019m working as a full time RN now and I miss the restaurant industry so much. It might be worth checking out. Wishing you the best of luck. :)",

You feel like you have no future, the present overwhelms you, therefore you are playing out an imaginary world, in a \"what could have been\". This is what you are sobbing about, the grief of a life where you had all this potential.\n\nThis regret cannot be solved by dwelling on it unfortunately. The only way to salvage it is to take this fight one day at a time. Try to get enough sleep, try to get enough food, try to improve your social dynamics. Eventually, and I know this seems so far away right now, when you get that feeling of happiness again, this regret will seem like a dream.... as it really is.\n\nYou just finished college, you are only 21. You have a long life ahead of you. There is no \"right life\" where everyone has to have their best time. If it makes you feel better, my most enjoyable part of my life came after college had ended for me. And I am sure there are much more enjoyable moments in the future.",

At the time I didn't realise that it might be the beginning of depression. I'm 25 now and I'm still struggling with this illness. There are still some up and downs but I'm still trying not to give up.",

I think on this all the time, the things my depression has robbed me of, let alone other issues fucked up in my life. For example, all the time I could\u2019ve spent with my son but was locked in a dark room sobbing... now he\u2019s 18 and ready to move out. So yeah, this shit destroys lives. \n\nI posted here twice leading up to my suicide plan hoping for help and got 3 responses from the entire forum. I know no one gives a fuck about some 50 yo guy, but I wish I hadn\u2019t assumed this was a real thread for helping with depression, or at least labelled \u2018young depression\u2019 or something. I ended up on medical suicide watch and seeing my therapist. Get help while you\u2019re young... but from a professional psych",

Since then I've had a few friends here and there but I find it hard to form meaningful attachments to people and being depressed makes it hard for me to maintain communication - it's hard work just getting out of bed in the morning most days. I can't help but feel I've been lost of my adolescence and missed out on a lot of experiences. Friends and my boyfriend will talk of wild stories and all the fun they had growing up and it upsets me because like you said, I feel that my mental illnesses have robbed me of those and those are years of my life I will never get back",

I'm in a similar situation to you but I've never been kissed and I have no college degrees you're also 7 years younger than me. I can tell you from first hand experience if you can forgive yourself, if you can't move on from dwelling on the past you will have no future.  You're still very young you've got atleast 7-9 years in you before you should really start to worry.  You've put your best foot forward, you've had a bf so you're capable of having a relationship, you've been to college so you have a nice degree. You've still got all your best life ahead of you sure you've missed out on some of the schools days but they don't matter that much I would say life starts to get good from 18-25 then it's down hill, once you hit 25 something click inside a horrible sudden realization of getting old you know when you turn 26 you'll be closer to 30 than 20 it's like you can feel your youth slipping away.

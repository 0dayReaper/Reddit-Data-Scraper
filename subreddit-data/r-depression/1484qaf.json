I live my life trying to better the lives of others. Only thing that makes me feel like existing is worth it, if you can\u2019t live for yourself, try giving your life to making others lives better, you might find something you enjoy doing, and even if you\u2019re miserable everyday for the rest of your life, you can go to sleep knowing the world was made a better place because you pushed thru your pain. \n\nIdk if you\u2019ll ever get better, but one day you will become strong enough to bear this pain, and that\u2019s something worth fighting for",

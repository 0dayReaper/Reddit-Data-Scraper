I\u2019ll surround myself with artists who think like me as much as I can. Fuck the real world. I can\u2019t stand being a hair stylist and going home to write by myself is all I look forward to.",

Feels kinda weird to even be a real person sometimes. I just go into auto pilot mode for a while whenever i have to function in the real world. I\u2019ve always felt like a foreigner in this world, even before i got to explore fictional universes.",

I feel like i just wanna grind in real life.. even made me think about mini-marathons\n\nAnd guess what? Life looks easier now.. i was mind-blowing about it! \n\nAnyone who wants to try running, i am available 24/7",

The main thing that pulled me into fiction is that usually, the main character has a clearly defined purpose, whereas we don\u2019t. They usually instantly gain a big responsibility in a short amount of time, without them actively working towards obtaining one, whereas we must discover it on our own, with a shit ton of trial and error. I know it genuenly hurts to have to live in such a boring world, but who knows, we haven\u2019t seen it all. We can only derive that the world is boring based on our life experiences, but the future can change. We can change it. That\u2019s at least what keeps me going.",

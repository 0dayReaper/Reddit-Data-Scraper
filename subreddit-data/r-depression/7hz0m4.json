I guess we can run this marathon together if that's what it should come for. You lean on me so your broken leg doesn't hurt as much, and I'll lean on the second person, etc. Have a wonderful day \u2764\ufe0f",

Just think about it.\n\nThe other thing, I might be a pussy, but saying this, into the eyes of me when I told him something I have never told to anyone is just rude. I was like, yeah dude I'm fragile, I'm having problems, I need help because I might end my life and want to have someone who knows, just in case. \"Yeah stop being a pussy, idiot\". Does it feel like a normal conversation ? I mean if he said something like, \"Dude you might be too sensitive, try to be happy\" I would be angry and I would note to myself, that he won't and can't really help, fine. But insulting me for trying to find some kind of help ? Even if it's not the best option, but at least I tried, I guess. If you can't help, I'm good with it, but at least don't insult me, when you know I'm down. \"Don't ever kick a person, when he is already laying on the ground\".\n\nI hope I answered your question why I think it's not appropriate.

It warps your whole view of reality to make everything seem worthless, make you seem like a piece of shit etc. If it's an ongoing thing rather than just being sad when something bad happens, then it's probably depression. If you feel like you are literally trapped inside your own pain rather than just being upset then it's probably depression. It's almost impossible to tell the difference sometimes but it's there.",

This is the most frustrating thing I encounter with people without depression or some debilitating illness. Why wouldn't any of us want to be happy?

I saw the original post, and your follow up, and understood that, because they perfectly reflected the way I\u2019ve felt my whole life. But I also decided to share an expansion upon that, which reflects the realizations that helped me in the past year and a half.\n\nI know these realizations will likely not sound true to many, but they are true to me, and I can only speak of what I\u2019ve experienced. I don\u2019t care to promise lies to others, but I do like to share that I am getting better after a life of hopelessnes, that I am determined to work towards getting better, and that I firmly believe that I can do so, or at least try my best in the time I have. And it stemmed from saying fuck the marathon, fuck the pointless running, I don\u2019t want to run no more. And realizing that I could, that I could walk or even lie still, and focus on doing whatever it took to beat the machinations of my sick mind.",

So many of us-- myself included-- have either a toxic mindset, or people in our lives who have this toxic mindset, that being depressed is somehow a matter of WILLPOWER. It is NOT. It is a real medical issue for which treatment is needed. \n\nIt's such a shitfest that people with this have to deal with having the struggle CONSTANTLY invalidated. But you guys, let me just tell you, anyone who treats this or you like it's all on your shoulders is a garbage, toxic fool. It's not. MOST people in this thread probably cannot handle this illness alone. I couldn't... and it's ok. It's sooo fucking hard, but it's not your fault, and it's not on you to make it all better either. People need help. Most of us here need some kind of help. \n\nI am getting help at the moment, and I'm grateful for that, although I have to be honest that process is grueling and painful. Sometimes constantly talking to/ exposing your feelings to people is like pulling teeth... but... for me, it's getting somewhere. \n\nMy point is: screw the people who are trying to convince you that this is all on your shoulders, or a matter of willpower, or mindset. This is NOT \"mind over matter\". Anyone who suggests that lacks an understanding of what's actually happening in the brain. \n\nI hope everyone here gets the help they need. &lt;3 Good luck, guys.

If they even attempt it at all, it's a mark of serious strength. Even if a healthy person could do it in 20 seconds, taking an hour and running out of strength halfway up is still a mark of strength and bravery and it's no different from someone struggling with depression merely surviving - that takes more courage than standing up to a bear and more perseverance than running a marathon.",

That and the \"happy mask\" screwed to your face so that the others don't have to face the monster in you. The price for this power of endurance is a soup\u00e7on of hope for every step forward.

After that, you begin a journey of healing the leg which can have an indefinite time line. You may need a combination or medication, physical therapy, surgery, occupational therapy, etc. You will need assistance walking and getting around. Your leg may never be the same again. You were once able to walk without even thinking about it, but now you have a disability that makes walking much more difficult. Your first goal after breaking your leg wouldn\u2019t be to run a marathon, it would be walking again. This could take a few months or a few years. No two bodies are the same and no two bodies heal the same way. Were you in shape before breaking your leg or did you never exercise? Do you need to walk for your job or can you do it sitting? Can other people accommodate this disability including your family, friends, and co workers?  And once you can walk again, that doesn\u2019t guarantee that your leg will work perfectly forever. In fact, it may put you more at risk for further injuries. \n\nAll of us who suffer from mental illness can relate to the journey of healing a broken leg. Hopefully, by offering an explanation that others can grasp, it may make them understand just a little bit of what you are going through. \ud83d\udc95",

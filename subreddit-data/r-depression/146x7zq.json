All I ever felt was being emotionally numb. \n\nI would very much like to read your experiences with your medications and doctors. I have tried psychotherapy but that only triggered me more \ud83e\udd7a\n\nAlso, what were your panic attack symptoms and how do you deal with it.\n\n\ud83d\ude42",

It eases the symptoms but i don't think any medication can treat depression tbh or atleast for me it hasn't. Yea it works by reducing the symptoms but that doesn't mean depression is over. It's all in the head...",

            "comment": "I started seeing a therapist my first semester of college (fall 2020), who recommended that I look into medication to help with some of the depression-related symptoms I was having. I went to my family doctor, who talked to me about my symptoms and started prescribing based on that. I started with Lexapro. It seemed to help with my anxiety, but did basically nothing for my depression. The only thing it really did was make me super nauseous and forgetful. My brain felt really foggy and it was like I could never fully concentrate. I just felt sort of... numb, like my emotions had been flattened instead of lifted.\n\nThen, I switched to Effexor, which made me constantly exhausted but also made it impossible to fall asleep, so I did basically nothing for the few months I was on it. I just kinda\u2026 existed. I had suicidal thoughts while on both Effexor and Lexapro, but it was more consistent with Effexor. It gave me weird, vivid dreams, and my appetite disappeared. I was also really emotional all the time. \n\nEventually, I was put on both Effexor and Wellbutrin. The Wellbutrin made my anxiety practically nonexistent, but my motivation &amp; mood were still super low, so Trintellix was added into the mix. But that kinda stopped working after a whole, and I started Prozac. Prozac made me suicidal to the point that I ended up in the emergency room, which was when my family doctor told me she didn\u2019t feel comfortable prescribing for me due to how many meds I\u2019d already tried that didn\u2019t help and recommended me to a psychiatrist. \n\nI started seeing a psychiatrist, who prescribed me Buspar, Paxil, and Vistaril. All of that combined made me so tired that I\u2019d fall asleep an hour after I took it, so I stopped Vistaril. Then she increased my Buspar because my anxiety got worse, then increased the Paxil because my depression symptoms weren\u2019t decreasing at all. I\u2019ve been on those doses since April of this year, and honestly I still don\u2019t feel any better, but I don\u2019t see her again until July since she\u2019s on maternity leave. \n\nI\u2019m also seeing an endocrinologist and an allergist, who\u2019ve helped me get a better idea of some physical health stuff that\u2019s contributed to it and recommended things that can help besides medication. Overall, my experience has been good, everyone\u2019s been willing to listen to me to figure out what best fits and makes changes based on what I\u2019m okay with. And they\u2019ve all been good at referring me to someone else if they feel my issues are out of their depth.",

It\u2019s progress, try to let it out instead of numbing yourself. Identify cycles leading to this dissociation. Try and \u201csnap out of it\u201d more often Maybe call a family member and talk, sometimes you gotta reach out and feel something, happy or sad, and that can push those emotions to the surface. \n\nI was wondering why I was so numb for so long, then I started praying and talking to my family a little more frequently and it brought me crashing back down to reality. Its almost like we avoid the people we love in this state, because it\u2019s too painful to feel or easier to ignore. I can definitely say this, along with exercise and some social experiments and saying how I feel (happy or sad, saying it out loud makes the emotions more powerful/real) have recently snapped me out of that dissociation in the short term. Yes other forms of therapy and difficult emotions arise when you talk with your parents or siblings, same goes for personal meditation/prayer, but in the end I\u2019ve realized that it might be the only way. Better to feel something like the love of your family/parents/friends than nothing",

Or even just talked to me about how my life slipping away was causing him his to slip away too and brought to my attention/called me out on the things I was no longer providing in the relationship for him that he needed.  \n\nBut he just \"let me be me\". Even though I came to loathe and despise who I was and which I let him know. We went through Job losses, a pregnancy that did not come to fruition, and so much more together. But instead of even subtly ever reminding me of who I was or who I had become, he just continued to let me live my \"life\", not getting in the way, not ever trying to take away from my independence, even though he was watching it become a sorry excuse for one. I found out two weeks ago he cheated on me for over a year during the one of the darkest depths of my depression. \n\nI asked him what he enjoyed talking about with this woman (she's married with three kids) and he said ,\n\" it was nice to talk to someone with common interests...just small things like beer and biking and stuff\".  I used to run a bar. I know and love a thing or two about beer. I did more shit outdoors before him and when he first met me then we ever did together, especially after my mental health slipped.   That's why he fell in love with me in the first place. He talked to her about MY pregnancy. He talked to her about MY depression. But never with me. He \"didn't know how to help me and didn't want to say the wrong thing and make it worse\" and chose to disregard my feelings when I told him open and honest conversation is good place to start. \n\nSorry for the novel, I think I'm just trying to get at that had he paid attention, took notice, then actively worked to remind me of those things he loved about me and I loved about myself, it would have done so much for me. I am NOT saying it's your fault by any means so I hope you don't beat yourself up,reading that. People do change. I think we just need to make sure if it's someone we love they wanted and welcome the change. \nWhatever she's going through, I'm glad you didn't cheat on her because of it. For her, I hope she finds her way back to herself and you find a new way moving forward with out her. \n\n",

    "postText": "21, law student- used to be carefree before entering college (which is in a different state than mine and I absolutely hate living or being there) now I don\u2019t even feel like wanting to talk to people, always demotivated and lacking energy to do anything. Can\u2019t even sit and watch a movie completely (which is not how I used to be earlier) I put on a movie and shut my laptop within minutes of it. Don\u2019t like to go out at all or meet people. When I\u2019m around friends, I have to pretend to be a person I\u2019m not. Have got so lazy over the past few months. Used to enjoy dancing, stopped. Enjoyed doing small things during the day, stopped. Lately I feel like I don\u2019t even smile anymore. Do I need help? Am I completely burnt out?",

Everything in my mood changed drastically ever since I got here. Being the most unhappiest time of my life and I hate it. I think whatever depression I\u2019m feeling circles to where my education has led me.",

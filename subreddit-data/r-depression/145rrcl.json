    "postText": "every day is mundane, i find no joy in anything i do. i recently went to a concert and i felt like i was faking being happy and forced myself to mimic my friend\u2019s emotions. \n\ni\u2019m on prozac and felt like it was working for the first few months but now i\u2019m convinced nothing is capable of working long-term. i\u2019m constantly battling intrusive thoughts and the overwhelming feeling of being exhausted. physically. mentally. it\u2019s all so taxing. going to work is a drag and i\u2019m so irritable through out my shift; and i work 12 long hours. \n\ni talk to my friends about it but i think i\u2019ve passively joked about wanting to be dead so often they don\u2019t take it seriously anymore. the truth\u2014the honest truth\u2014 i do want to be dead. i\u2019m tired of existing. i\u2019ve come to terms that even the smallest moments of happiness were temporary but the moments where i was sad felt longer. \n\ni feel alone in this and i don\u2019t know how to overcome it. it feels like noone truly understands or can help. i\u2019m sure there is someone or something that can but i just don\u2019t know anymore. i\u2019m so tired",

Life can be so slow and mundane and yet so beautiful at the same time. Sometimes something like a concert can be so excessive that It just gets compressed into a big sausage of over stimulation. \n\nLittle things can be so great. Just the feeling of the water on your head when you are in the shower. Or  how your eyelids look from the inside when you have your eyes closed and the sun is shining on your face. \n\nRefocus. You will be okay. I promise. The universe loves that you are here. Show it some love back.",

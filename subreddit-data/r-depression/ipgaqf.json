I really feel the person who said they are their own caretaker. Managing my mental health really is a fulltime job. I've done lots of different kinds of volunteer work over the years, which allows me to ramp up my workload when I'm coping well, and quickly wind it down again if I start to get wobbly.\n\nI've been fortunate to live in a country that has the tattered remains of a social welfare system, so I've been able to at least keep a roof over my head and food in the cupboards (most of the time). I really feel for those of you whose countries let people literally rot in the gutter instead of helping them when they struggle with \"normal\" life.",

I burdened my family with the idea that I suffered chronic migraines when in fact it felt like the only way to make people understand that I was suffering. My college years I found temporary relief from my misery in drug use and reckless behavior which disregarded everyone around me. That only ended in me hurting people and losing almost all of my friends. \n\nI don't do these things anymore. I still don't want to exist every day and this has become more intense because of those mistakes. The addition of a guilty conscious makes day to day existence almost unbearable. I have found solace only in trying my best to learn more and have responsibility for people and things beyond myself. This keeps me alive. Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning is a book I can not recommend enough. \n\nI hope this helps. You're not alone and if you can find the strength to overcome the terrible burden that has been laid upon and to bear it, you will find that you begin to have some relief. Or, if not relief, the strength to bear your suffering for the sake of those around you. Everyone suffers, the key to a good life is to bear your suffering enough that you may be able to lesson the suffering of others. You, as someone who suffers a great deal, have a unique capacity to help others who suffer. \n\nTry not lying at all for one day. If you sleep better that night, try again. Etc, etc.",

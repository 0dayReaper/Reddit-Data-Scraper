    "postText": "So my family hired a house guard for night security. The guy is super nice and is a university student and he usually studies in his shift. So let me tell you what happened. In my house there is a room near the main gate of my house. In that room there is one A/C and my gaming setup. The outer part of my A/C or you can say the outer pipe where the water comes from the A/C is near the little guard house. So as usual i was gaming and the guard called me and said that all his books are wet because of the water. I said sorry but he was to nice and said no worries. All his books were wet and tearing a part. When i try to sleep his face is always in front of my eyes please help me what should i do",

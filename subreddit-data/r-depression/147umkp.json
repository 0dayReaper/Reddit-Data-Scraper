I find it quite difficult to put into words, but it\u2019s kind of an ongoing sense of \u201cI\u2019ve seen everything and experienced everything and nothing excites or interests me. It\u2019s all boring now until I die\u201d. This makes it difficult to engage in any new activities and I struggle to make new friends as I struggle to take an interest in other people. \n\nFeel like I need to discover some excitement and joie de vivre but I\u2019m increasingly convinced I won\u2019t be able to shake myself out of this mindset and am doomed to feeling bored, miserable and jaded \n\nI\u2019m on antidepressants and have tried different forms of counseling but nothing has really helped. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice?\n\nThank you",

What excites you - the unknown?\n\nBut maybe it's more that you are simply depressed - it sounds like you're not feeling any excitement in day to day life.\n\nI have this problem that whenever I'm doing pretty well, I develop existential anxieties. I don't feel it at all when I'm struggling. When everything is ok it's like the decks are clear and I can tackle the next problem - and that ultimate dread starts to sit with me every day.\n\nI wonder if you have a similar problem. Maybe you need a struggle; a vulnerability. Maybe you need to take a risk - start a side hustle, or a YouTube channel - put yourself out there with a chance to fail.\n\nAll I know is that the mind is kind of obstinate unless you change/add to what you're feeding it. Thought is good, but action can yield better results. Oh, and your heart might not be in anything you decide to try. But that's just at the start... Good luck.",

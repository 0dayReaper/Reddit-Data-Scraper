    "postText": "So I\u2019m 15m and I\u2019ve been so depressed recently because of lack of friends or relationship. I think there\u2019s something wrong with me but idk what it is. I\u2019ve tried so hard to meet new people but they always leave me. I feel hopeless that I will never find any connection at all. I\u2019m so jealous because I see everyone around me at school with their friends, or partner, and it just makes me feel so lonely. I haven\u2019t talked to anyone in the past two years. I just want someone to have a connection with, rather than be alone my whole life and pretend everything\u2019s fine. I need someone to talk to, and make me feel like an actual person. I\u2019ve tried everything. I feel like there\u2019s no hope for me",

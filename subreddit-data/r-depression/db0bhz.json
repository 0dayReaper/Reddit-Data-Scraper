I just can't stand to be awake anymore and even though just about everyone in my life says I need to fix this, I don't want to. Sleep is like a step-up from death. If I can't have death, at least let me have sleep.",

It's honestly probably a good thing because it's helping me lose weight, lol. \n\nI'm an adult and legally disabled, so I can't/don't have to go anywhere during the day except doctor appointments, which I usually end up cancelling. I get out of the house about once a month to get groceries (maybe... it depends because sometimes I can't muster the energy to get out of bed, so I just opt to not eat instead). I guess I'm lucky because I don't have kids -- especially since I wouldn't be able to take care of them when I can't even take care of myself.\n\nI honestly just sleep my life away, but I prefer it like that. My dreams are the only place I feel alive. I actually have emotions again and sometimes my dreams are able to motivate me (usually by dreaming of doing whatever it is I need to do) enough to get out of bed and do basic chores around the house or go grocery shopping.",

When I think back on who I used to be (so young and eager and full of hope), it's almost like I'm seeing an entirely different person. They no longer exist anymore -- and they never will again. I ruined my own life and mental illness and disability didn't help. I'll probably never be able to fix it because I can't stand to be awake long enough to even try. I just want to go to sleep one night and never wake up, barring that we'll see what happens next.",

So if I don't go to bed early I'll feel like its not even worth going to bed at that point. So naturally my only guarantee that I will actually be awake to tend to my responsibilities is for me to stay up the whole night. I have insomnia so I take meds reguarly. If I don't take them I almost feel half dead after the all nighter. Without taking them I feel really tired but even if I do decide to lay in bed I absolutely will not sleep. I laid in bed for 8 hours waiting for sleep, it never came. Anyways I try to have the best attitude I can have but it's damn hard. I hope you know that you are not alone. We're all trying to survive the best we can. It gets the better of me at tipping points sometimes. Regardless, I feel you dude. Everyday's a battle, sometimes people(like me) start to care less about winning. I feel like we're not working towards a destination but rather making the journey progress rather than trying to make it perfect. Easier said than done. I hope things get brighter for you.",

                            "comment": "Nah, it's okay. I don't mind getting messages when it's something I can relate to. There's something cathartic about talking to people that understand where you're coming from, especially on a topic that's usually scarcely talked about. So thank you for commenting!\n\nAaaa, I get that. I just don't function well without at least 10-12 hours of sleep. I don't necessarily sleep only at night thought. I have a horribly habit of sleeping during the day and being awake only at night -- or sleeping during the day and waking up at 5pm. lol. It's a bad habit, but I'll always opt to sleep over not. I don't want to be awake for longer than I have to be.\n\nDamn, I get that though. When I was a teenager, I used to have really bad insomnia. It sucks a lot. Even after my doctors gave me ambien, it still only helped half the time. If I took it and it didn't work, I'd just end up hallucinating (mildly) from it. I'm sorry you struggle with insomnia though. It's miserable and I'm so glad I've jumped from insomnia to hypersomnia. I don't know what I'd do if I had to be conscious all the time. \n\nThank you for your well wishes! I appreciate that, though I feel like I've largely given up at this point? It's been 15 years since I developed this mental illness and every year, it gets worse. I feel like I was born seeing the world in ravishing technicolor only to lose a color every year. One day it feels like I'll only be able to see the world in shades of gray and that's a depressing thought. \n\nI definitely relate with your sentiment about \"caring less about winning\". For me, I don't have a destination I'm wafting in the direction of anymore (that life is lost and I don't believe I'll ever meet those goals. It's just time to accept that for me.). Every day is a struggle to survive and every day that I wake up in the morning (or at night), it means I've lived to see another day.",

I can only imagine it's something like sleep, or just the simple vastness of nothing. We just dont exist anymore really, it's like the gaps of our dreams or the nights we dont dream at all, but for forever. Because once we die, we're gone and never coming back. Which can be horrifying and both wonderful in the end. Death is painful in the end really, all we feel in most forms of suicide is absolute agony and then- nothing. Darkness, no thoughts, feelings, or a chance to get up again and live. Were just sunken bodies that suffered immensely in life. \nHaving someone die is, life changing. My friend died 3 years ago yesterday and- the impact it left was astounding. You always think death is easy to outrun, but it effects everyone. I always think to myself, what is he feeling? But hes feeling nothing, hes gone. Hes gone and no matter how hard I scream and cry hes never going to come back. Death is horrifying, its irreversible and scarring to anyone involved. I miss him, so fucking much and someone will miss you too. Life, is not fair. It's not fair and we shouldnt have to put up with it, but the only thing we can do is keep going and try to get back up. We can escape the shit storm that is depression and mind crippling disability together, even if it takes us years we can feel good to be alive again. One day, even if it's so incredibly far away- one day we can be better again. Tell the world to go fuck itself and that we made it, because you're not alone. We're not alone- and we can do this no matter how draining and destroying it is.",

Every single time i'm going to sleep I pray I won't wake up again, i'm functioning, I wake up every day and go to work but I just can't stand my life, i've been like this for as long as I can remember. I feel like i'm just not meant for this world. I'm a complete introvert, I feel like people can't stand me. I've been battling with myself in my head with all this for years and years. I don't feel like I fit in with society, I don't feel I belong anywhere, and I hate myself. Nobody ever sees this though because i'm very healthy and athletic, you'd never know if you saw me in the street. I have a 10yr old son and a 4yr old daughter and I love them but the only reason I stay alive is for them but I just don't want to do it anymore. I just can't stand this world. But I keep it all a complete secret. I don't want to tell anybody. This has been going on for way too long now and I just put on a happy face, politely shake people's hands and smile and go through the repetitive motions of life and just say (Yeah i'm really good) like everybody does \ud83d\ude44. I think i'm borderline bipolar and I just have to fake my whole life and it's completely exhausting. I just don't know how much longer I can keep it up. I don't want to do this anymore. I can't I need help \ud83d\ude22. I just had to tell somebody.......",

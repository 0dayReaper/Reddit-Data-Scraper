    "postText": "Have been having a rough time over the past few years, almost 34 and the years keep going quicker. Not clinically diagnosed with depression but feel like it's pretty obvious at this point. Don't really want to go down the rabbit hole of dealing with doctors anyways, see too many of them already but it's crossed my mind.\n\nOn the outside I feel like people generally see me as independent and high functioning, i own my house and keep to myself and my schedule but everything seems so stacked against me. Have no real close friends to speak of, work kinda drains me and I have no relationship experience because I'm way too introverted and anxious.\n\nMy health kinda sucks as I was born with congenital heart defects and had a fontan operation which is also causing cirosis. I'm still doing ok and generally my doctors are pretty positive about all of it but it's definitely a huge uncertainty for me and really contributes to my anxiety and worry along with kinda making it hard to relate sometimes with people my age. Plus just going to random checkups every six months is a constant reminder I don't need.\n\nI live in a small town and it's impossible to meet anyone as you get older, feel like I'm always home by myself when I'm not at work and don't get out much just because work wipes me out and I have no one to go anywhere with.\n\nSeriously questioning what the point is sometimes, don't get me wrong I'm not suicidal or anything as I couldn't do that to my family but it sure be great to have more things in life to look forward to.",

            "comment": "I can symposize. I won't say I completely understand your situation. Mine has since Jan. Lost everything, not an exaggeration. If I didn't have family close I would be starving living my car. Even though don't like the living situation, I'm thankful for it. No one that sees me does not think I'm functional. Most days I can't find the motivation to get from the couch to the computer. Trying to say I get it. Up until 2 weeks my girlfriend was only source of any hope. Big mistake. Gone. I got extremely lucky or maybe the universe doesn't completely hate me. A person in that I didn't recognize as a resource may end being the only one save me. I so much wish that for. I spent days looking online for someone to talk to.. My findings\nUnless are actively trying to harm yourself or others or have insurance. I couldn't find anything. Reddit may have saved me. Only place that people reached out. Even today. I was on trying annoy people on here. Some stranger reached out in relation to something more serious I posted. Trust issues will not let share everything with anyone except this one person in my life. This person could be sounding board or another resources. I make no claims to help anyone but a sounding board I can be. If you have insurance I would look into online therapy. I am taking medicine for depression and anxiety from a reasonable priced place\nWish I could afford the online therapy. I have rambled way too much.",

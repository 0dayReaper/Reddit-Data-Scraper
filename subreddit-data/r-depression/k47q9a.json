Everything feels like a chore, and it's exhausting. \"Do things that you enjoy doing\" doesn't work, since everything feels like watching paint dry. Realising that you're slowly beginning to lose interest in the few things you enjoy doing and realising that there's nothing you can do about it is mentally torturing. It's like trying to catch smoke with your bare hands; it's hopeless. The only thing you look forwards to is death.",

It can be paying bills, doing a load of laundry, washing out the cat box, sometimes just making a single necessary phone call. Just one little step each day. Makes me feel like, even in my essentially emotionally paralyzed state, I am moving forward.\n\nAnd if you fail, no consequences. Just try again the next day.\n\nWhen I can do this, it makes me feel better; I don't feel like the day is a total loss.

I try to paint my nails because it gives me something to focus on and then there\u2019s long stretches where the point is to not do anything while they dry.

I fired a real stinker earlier in the year.\n \nI got the most out of structured programs based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy.. Not just an hour for me to bitch and moan, especially about the past; that got me nowhere. Those therapies focus on what do YOU do NOW when your negative emotions get set off, and you are spiralling down. \n\nYou learn to recognize your patterns, because if you can step back and SEE what you are doing- yet again- it makes it feel more like the depression/anxiety etc. Is something that is happening TO you, and not so much you are a warped, damaged person doomed to unhappiness. \n\nCheck out YouTube or other free platforms and see if there are any videos that go into the principles of these types of therapies. \n\nAnd Adderall helps me. Thank God I found a psychiatrist who agrees it has a valid antidepressant effect on some people. (I also tested positive for ADHA as an adult).  I suspected I was dopamine deficient years ago after all the serotonin reuptake inhibitors didn't do squat for me. \n\nSo keep trying. I've been battling this monster for decades, and have found some tools that help. There may be some amazing drug therapies on the way, notably Ketamine and MDMA.",

Not that you have asked for advice but sharing from my own experience, the one thing that has always helped me is to go to the edge of a body of water and sit. Listening to the sounds, watching the water, feeling the air...I guess you could call it meditation. Every sadness and awful feeling starts to drift away and I briefly find a peaceful state. It often goes away when i leave, but I've continued the practice almost every day and even if it only helps for a moment out of the day, that is still huge. If you live near a body of water-I imagine most people do- I will always recommend going to sit beside it. Maybe find a moment to shut your eyes and breathe. Water is the original source of life, so maybe that's why it makes me feel more present and alive. I wish you the best.",

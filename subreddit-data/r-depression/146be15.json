    "postText": "I have an apprenticeship (i think thats what it is in english. I learn the job fpr 2-3 years with lower salary and then work normally after) starting in august. \n\nRight now my grandmother told me again to finally do something useful until it starts. With this underhanded tone of disappointment disgust. \n\nPreviously i told myself that leraning how to better manage my depression is useful. That it is okay for me to try to stabilize as much as possible, in order to be as stable as i can get in august. \n\nNow i just hate myself and feel like the most disgusting and entitled human to ever live.",

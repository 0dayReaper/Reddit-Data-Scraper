    "postText": "This depressive episode is getting worse. I have no appetite. I'm not digesting the food I do eat. I am consuming less that 500 calories a day. I'm weak and shaking. \n\nI have nightmares every night.  I take my anxiety medication at bedtime so I can fall asleep. I wake up by 3 am. I am completely exhausted. \n\nI feel like I'm going to just disappear. And I am looking forward to that.",

Like another commenter suggested, smoking weed might help with your appetite. Also trying to regulate your sleep schedule might help, as sleep plays a huge role in our hunger related hormones. You\u2019ll be okay, have faith in yourself.",

    "postText": "I've been unhappy my whole life, childhood come straight up. My parents were never together, besides the one time they made me, I highly suspect my conception was not consensual, but that's a whole other story. I can safely say my parents didn't care for each other at all.\n\nMost of my earliest memories were of me being passed back and forth between my parents and they in turn would pass me off to other family/friends to look after me. It wouldn't have been so bad if some of those people weren't so abusive. Getting hit when I did something bad is one thing, but getting beat for no reason or explanation was another. Then there was all the sexual stuff. Learning about and engaging in sexual acts so young has definitely affected how I perceive intimacy as an adult.\n\nSo I definitely grew up with an unshakable sense of being unwanted and unloved. Except I thought those negative feelings and emotions were normal and everyone felt that way.\n\nIt wasn't until around age 12 I started living full time with my dad for school and made friends of my own I learned not every one felt all these constant negative emotions.\nMy life goals around this time developed into three distinct points: 1 migrate to a better country. 2 have a significant other I could love and trust. 3 have a child and raise them in a safe and loving environment.\n\nEventually I was in a long term relationship that I was convinced, without a doubt,it was going to last forever. We got engaged and I started attending university in another country with the eventual goal of migrating there. Unfortunately that relationship didn't work out and ended very badly and dramatically.\n\nAround this time I truly fell into deep depression. I would have immediately killed myself if it weren't for my elderly ailing father. Instead I made up my mind to take care of him then kill myself after he died. That was the mentality I had for years that allowed me to be an apathetic, unmotivated stoner that didn't care about anything.\nEventually he did pass and I had my suicide attempt. It was a feeble attempt that obviously didn't work but it did shake me out of that mentality for awhile. By this time I basically smoked and drank away my savings/inheritance. \n\nLife carried on, I did eventually seek professional mental health help. Even with therapy and medication I couldn't fully get over the mentality of \"I'm eventually going to kill myself\". \n\nThen COVID hit, I lost my job, people close to me died. Depression came back in full force and got worse and worse. The initial isolation of lockdown along with depression caused a kind of social anxiety I've never had before. Over the past year I've gone days to weeks without social interaction.\n\nI know the way I am now is not good or healthy. I know the things I'm supposed to do to get better; get a job, go back to therapy, start back medication , exercise, practice socialising. But I really don't care to be \"better\" anymore. Knowing that I can fall back into this mentality, what's even the point? \nFinally writing all this out, knowing someone might read this and relate does help.",

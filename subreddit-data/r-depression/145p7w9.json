    "postText": "Pretty plain and simple. I hate life. I am a sophomore in college and i wanted to kill myself sophomore year of highschool, I stuck it through, obviously,  it I have simply learned I hate everyone and every thing.  I thoguht things will ups get better, but they don\u2019t. Everyone I talk to is a total dick to me since I\u2019m overweight and stuttering (I lost 50lbs for a while and noticed a massive difference in how I was treated.) I\u2019ve had the stutter my whole life and nothing has fixed it, no one likes to talk to me because of how it takes me so long to talk.\n\nI thought college was going to be better, but it ended up with me getting left out of pretty much everything, even in a friend group that \u201ccared\u201d for me. I was robbed at gunpoint on my campus, and a girl I was talking to tried to control my actions by serving ultimatums of hanging out with other dudes or slitting her wrist to control me, and I would have to help clean up the mess. \n\nI\u2019m tired of it. No one talks to me unless I start the conversation, no one wants to hang out with me unless it is a common event (big party) or unless I try to make plans and stress over them.\n\nI have one good friend, they are amazing and I love them to the moon and back, but it simply keeps getting worse. If there were no consequences I seriouslywould roam around and tell everyone off and get really nasty.\n\nI\u2019ve tried therapy twice, the first one said I wanted to kill myself because I had a gluten/dairy allergy (news flash, I don\u2019t) and the one I\u2019m currently with is barely even helping because they are about to graduate and can fuck off and do whatever.\n\nI feel like shit all the time, my head is constantly running with thoughts, I can barely even enjoy being around other people like my family and I just finished a week at the beach thanks to them for taking me and i feel like a total dick for being irritable/distanced.\n\nI am in a fraternity, but will most likely go inactive at the start of this semester, which leaves me in an awkward spot for housing as I live with people associated with the chapter and kinda the \u201cleftovers.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve tried medication, but it makes me extremely angry, not in a violent way but I will start fuming over small issues when they shouldn\u2019t be an issue. \n\nAt this point I\u2019m about to give up, and it already feels like I have. I hate everyone, everything, and life. Nothing gives me joy besides getting extremely crossed and hoping something gets better. I\u2019ve even tried sobriety, and even 2 months of that has not helped.",

            "comment": "Man, the title is something I've said to myself so many times before. I dropped out of a community college I attended a few years ago due to simply running out of the energy to continue trying. I remember thinking that exact sentence to myself the day I dropped out. With enough time though I was able to move on with my life and find new paths. I'm 1000% sure you will do the same! An ex of mine used to tell me when I was feeling stressed or sad that \"you have a 100% success rate of getting through your problems.\" Naturally, this doesn't mean you get through every problem you encounter perfectly or even with grace. It just means that you survived and overcame the issue or chose a different path to go down entirely which is equally as fine as overcoming something directly! If you give it enough time, you'll get through this too. If you can do so, try to do something you enjoy doing to get your mind off the exam or maybe even vent to a friend or relative about the exam. I hope you feel better asap! Reddit is always here if you need a place to vent as well!",

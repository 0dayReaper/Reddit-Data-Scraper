    "postText": "I don't think I ever did anything right in my life I mean socially for example, I always end up losing people maybe not all of them but I do I lost so many because \"I'm wrong\" why is it wrong to talk to anybody I want ? Why is it wrong to talk to somebody when I have the least feelings for even if she is not the one ? And why do I feel like everyone is pitying me like I'm a sick person even if they didn't I have this feeling. The way I think is wrong so anything I do is wrong and people just don't get it when was I right about anything. Even the girl I think about is actually using me, we don't speak for a while so she texts me and then ghosting me for days and now I'm invited for her graduation party and after I told her I'm going \"because I'm respectful and thought to give a chance\" she still ghosting me, where did it go wrong with her too? Even my friends they are sometimes bored of me and I'm talking about everyone of them. I should be studying now or I'm gonna fail but I just can't stop thinking of me as a problem also I'm too scared to end it, living kills anyway",

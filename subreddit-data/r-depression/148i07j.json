    "postText": "I'm close with someone who has been depressed for awhile now and finally had a breakdown the other day. We are taking some time apart and I'm happy to give him space which I do think that's what he needs the most right now. But I don't want to leave him alone for too long. I don't think he'll try to kill himself but I'm worried the negative thoughts will overtake and make him worse if he doesn't have a distraction every so often. I also have depression so I understand on some level but what I need when I'm depressed is different then him so I wanted to see what are some good ways to help a man who is depressed? I have some ideas but I wanted some advice first before I moved forward with anything. I don't want to make things worse for him right now.",

I\u2019m severely depressed, I have a neurological disorder which isn\u2019t debilitating but definitely hinders day to day life, I have insomnia and I have these occipital migraines that make me want to sleep it off but I can\u2019t sleep. Sometimes I can\u2019t sleep to the extent where I\u2019m sleeping four out of seven nights a week. \n\nI\u2019m perpetually exhausted and my brain fog is bad. Yet, I get As in school and maintain a social life so my parents are perplexed as to why I\u2019m this depressed and I don\u2019t know how to tell them it\u2019s all a farce. \n\nI don\u2019t think I was meant to exist, it\u2019s not a cry for help or pity and I\u2019m not really religious so it\u2019s not an existential nihilism thing. People have it worse than me but right now and for the last few years this has been nearly more than I could bear. What kind of quality of life is this\u2026",

And surely your insomnia and migraines make your depression worse.\n\nIm not trying to say it's all in your head because your feelings are completely valid and I get it, but are their any logical reasons that you believe you shouldn't exist? Depression sucks so bad and I know that's what the root of my similar feelings and thoughts were coming from.\n\nIt's comforting to me when I start to think these things to remind myself that the reason I feel like this is because of depression and not because of me and thus I tell myself it isnt true. It doesn't get rid of the thoughts but it gives me a bit of comfort to know that my disorder/illness is what's causing those thoughts and it's not my fault.",

This feeling of inadequacy can come from a lot of places, maybe you are not studying in the right field, maybe you feel no real connection to your group of friends or even family. You have to find your tribe so to speak, the group of people to where you truly belong to, but this can be harder to do as you would have to know yourself very well. You could check your hobbies, desires etc.\n\nAlso, it could strictly be a medical issue due to the health issues you are already facing. I would be more worried that you hold this unrealistic beliefs which could be a serious sign of deep mental issues. I mean, next thing you might genuinely believe is that you were abducted by aliens, you get the idea.\n\nSo, I'm not mocking you or anything like that, just observe yourself and see where your thinking goes haywire. Also, a belief like this, will most certainly reflect in a bad way on your health, so I'd be careful holding it any longer.\n\nMost likely, your depression is playing tricks on you. Besides the medical help, I would say exercise daily, even more in your case cause when the body is really tired you will most likely fall asleep. Then get enough sunlight, find a support group and focus on learning a new skill, hobby. Whatever we focus upon, we become. Simple as that.\n\nTake care and just enjoy your youth. And if you really weren't meant to exist, well I guess this life is extra, right?  So why not make the most of it? I mean, the joke's on them. You're like a cat with 10 lives :))",

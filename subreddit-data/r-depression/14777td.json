    "postText": "I know Reddit is not the best place to look for help, but I'd rather see if anyone here can actually give me advice or whatnot before I try to go see a therapist.\n\nFirst a bit of background.\n\nI'm 19m and straight. I've grown up with the mindset that I should find a wife and have a family before too long, and I still have that mindset and won't be convinced against it (I know a lot of people here will disagree with me). I never really did well in school, I'm smart but I've got ADHD so it's always been a struggle. I graduated high school in '21 and I just finished my first semester of automotive engineering classes at my local community college. I passed all 3 classes which was a relief, I've just got 3 or 4 more semesters to go in order to get my degree and be able to get certified.\n\nIf it wasn't clear by now, I plan to make a career out of the automotive field, following in my dad's footsteps. He got his associate's degree from a community college and made his way through the field starting at smog shops, then as an entry level technician at a dealership, then as a fully-certified technician at multiple dealerships until moving on to teaching at the school that I now attend.\n\nI have only ever had 1 real job, and that was as a Loader at Lowe's. Minimum wage, 16 hours a week, not making much money. I worked there for a year until November of last year when I got fired for not showing up enough. I like to think I learned my lesson, but I really don't know because I haven't had a job since. I've been making all my money from DoorDash and Uber Eats, but it's not a consistent income and my car's V8 engine eats up gas and some weeks I will break even. In fact, I spend so much money that I am never able to save extra money, I've been sitting on around 20 bucks for months. I owe my parents thousands of dollars from my immature spending habits from the last 6 months, and my credit card is almost maxed out.\n\nBack on the subject of jobs though, I have been searching for a job in my city since the day I lost my job at Lowe's. I figured that since I am taking automotive classes and I know that's the career I want, I should look for an entry level job in that field. I have applied to every parts store, several oil and tire shops, and even took the opportunities that my college provided to apply to positions offered by companies in the field. Yet I've only had 1 interview from any of those places, a tire shop that I was confident in, but alas, I'm just some 5'7\" 120lbs kid who sucks at conversation, and I'm not the right candidate for that job.\n\nOh, but here comes some fast food chain that I happened to apply for as well, and they schedule an interview and YAY I get the job. Here's the catch. The building aint finished yet. The manager said \"oh, they just need the plumbing and lights, it's almost done.\" that was like 2 months ago. I keep watching for the email saying to come in for training, and I also keep driving by the unfinished restaurant to see the progress. It's been in the same condition the whole time and I never see trucks or tractors or workers there, or any sign of productivity. So I wait every day to start working at my promised job, while I make 0 money and get more into debt with my parents.\n\nAll of this is just the beginning. I don't think I would be nearly as depressed if I wasn't so FUCKING LONELY. I have ONE friend. He's not even my age, he's 14. The only reason we're friends is because our sisters are friends and we have some common interests. The biggest of these is guns. He's 14 so he's not old enough to buy guns, but his dad bought him a $2000 sniper rifle and all we do with it is target shooting. Me being 19, I am old enough to buy certain guns, so I have a .357 Magnum lever action rifle, and we go plinking with that as well. But what I don't like is that guns are one of the only common interests we have. He knows almost nothing about cars, and we have completely different opinions on which cars are cool. As a car enthusiast, he kinda frustrates me when he tries to tell me why he doesn't like my favorite cars, or why he thinks all 80s and 90s cars are ugly, and he instead likes how the (just a random example) 2018 Toyota Prius Prime looks. He will ignore me when I tell him that's regarded as one of Toyota's ugliest cars, and yeah, he can have his opinion, but when my favorite thing in the world is something he knows and cares so little about, it just makes it less fun to be around him. As a side note, we also listen to completely different music, I can't stand the music he likes, and he can't stand my music, so car rides (which are often because he lives out in the country and whenever we go anywhere it's a long ride) are either an absolute bore, or pain for one of us.\n\nTo add on top of all of this, I have never been able to make friend with people older than me, and I hate it so much. It's made me incredibly immature which makes it even harder to make friends that are older than me. Plus my height and looks don't help one bit. I want so bad to have a friend who 1. Is my age, 2. Has the same love for cars as me, 3. Has the same or similar musical taste to me, and 4. Has the same morals and political ideologies as me.\n\nThis brings us on to girlfriends. Here's a list of the girlfriends I've had over the years, and what made them unique.\n\nWait, I've never been in any close relationships with any girls.\n\nEnter my friend's sister. She is \n\n1. Close to my age. I am 19, and she'll be 18 later this year.\n2. Beautiful. She may not be up there by most guys' standards, but on mine she's a 9 if not a 10.\n3. Incredibly sweet. She treats me better than she treats her own brother, and she hasn't done one thing yet to make me upset.\n4. A good moral, traditional girl. I want a wife who can fulfill the hard working job of a wife while I go out and put in a day's work to come home to a beautiful family in a nice house.\n\nNow I haven't actually told this girl my feelings for her, but I suspect she knows. The other day I texted her to ask her something personal, and she said that if it's something about romance, that I should know she's not ready for a relationship. Well, I knew this. She'd had her heart broken by a guy who she found out already had a long-term girlfriend. I have known my boundaries with her and have never tried asker her out because I've been waiting for a sign that she's ready.\n\nBut what's this? What do we see? A dumbass? A stupid immature idiot? Oh, it's me. Here to fuck up everything.\n\nUnsatisfied with having to wait, I created a Bumble account and a Tinder account. At first I just wanted to see what it was like, but when I saw that I had been getting a few likes, I had to find out more. I spent money on the programs they had to see if I could talk to these girls. I talked for a few days to one girl in a neighboring town, but she stopped replying to me and I gave up. I decided that dating apps probably weren't the way to go. Back to waiting.\n\nThat didn't last long. 1 month later, I was back on Tinder. But this time was different. I matched with a girl who seemed like a good person. We'll call her Jessie. Jessie is just a year younger than me, she's pretty, she has similar music tastes, and she's pretty funny. We have been talking for maybe a week now. Even though Jessie lives in the same town as me, we haven't been able to find time to meet in person. We've Snapchatted, called, and even video called, but the whole time I've just wanted to meet her. I can't do texting, calling is better, but I'm not there with the person so it doesn't feel the same, and when we video call, it's always pretty laggy. I just want to be there with her to talk and spend time, even if we don't do anything special. I want to take her in my car on a curvy road at night and just enjoy the feeling of having someone beside me.\n\nBut something's changed the past 2 days. Yesterday, Jessie only texted me once after I'd asked her several questions. We had a Snapchat streak going but she didn't keep it going yesterday. Having never met her in person yet, I haven't really been able to get to know her enough to know what kind of person she is, and if she actually likes me. She also turned off her location on Snapchat, and IDK how to feel about that. I'm not the kind of guy to stalk, but just having the feeling of knowing where she is gives me a sense of comfort. Plus, I don't know if she did that because she'd seen me on the Snapchat map in her neighborhood for a DoorDash delivery and thought I was trying to find her, because she expressed concern when she saw that, even though I assured her it was a coincidence.\n\nIn any case, thinking about if I did something wrong or if Jessie has decided she doesn't like me is physically making me sick to my stomach. I took my best friend and his sister to church this morning and stayed for the service, but the whole time I really just wanted to go home and lay in bed. So here I am, alone in my room with the door locked, venting to strangers online. I don't even know if anybody will take the time to read every line of this, but if you have, thanks I guess.\n\nBut I think I need to get my point across, and I should probably summarize and conclude my situation here:\n\nI'm a short immature unattractive guy. I've got one friend who is 5 years younger than me and often annoys me. I want a better friend who I can spend more time with, but even more than that I want to find a wife. For the longest time I have liked my best friend's sister, who also happens to be my sister's best friend, but she's not ready for a relationship, and I don't have the patience to wait. I used dating apps to try to look for a girl, and it may have succeeded, but the girl I met hasn't replied in a day, and for no reason at all, I'm nervous. To add to all these things, I'm in debt, my car is not enjoyable to drive, I don't have a job yet because I'm waiting until they email me, and my life is going nowhere.\n\nBut the reason that my feelings make no sense, is that I'm not actually in as bad of a situation as I could be. My parents still allow me to live in their house, even while I owe them thousands of dollars and spend most of my time at home on my phone. I have my own car that is actually pretty nice. It's a 1995 Lexus LS400, which is one of my dream cars, and I bought it with my own money. I have a girl that is actually talking to me and I haven't been friend-zoned. I passed all my classes for last semester, which was incredibly hard for me, and my dad is paying for all of my college. I even have a locked down job that I don't have to worry about losing, I just have to wait for them to send an email to come in for training. This job also will pay more than my previous job, and since I'm already working for DoorDash and Uber Eats, I have a way to make extra money on top of my job.\n\nI should be happy. Why then, why the fuck am I depressed? Why am I never happy, why can I not just find reasons to smile and have fun? I don't want to die, I'm not even close to that. I know everything is fine, there's just something deep inside of me that won't let me be in a good mood.\n\nWhatever you folks can say to help me is appreciated. I'm sorry this was so long, I have even more I could've said, but I would've had to reorganize everything to add it in. But yeah, that's what I got.",

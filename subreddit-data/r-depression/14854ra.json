    "postText": "I want to preface by saying that I\u2019m not unfamiliar with mental illness and that I have my own struggles. So I am very lenient and accommodating when it comes to other people exhibiting signs. \n\nThere\u2019s just one thing I\u2019ve been struggling to understand for so long. I really want some perspective on it. \n\nMy friends who struggle with depressive spells bleed their energy into me whenever they are in it. I\u2019m not expecting them to think of other people when they are in a rut. But I feel that I shouldn\u2019t be subject to abuse/ maltreatment/ neglect every time. \n\nI always feel that I\u2019m on my high horse when I think this: when I\u2019m in a certain negative state of mind I try my hardest to not let it affect other people. Especially my friends. But I never receive the same grace. \n\nI feel like an a**hole. So just give it to me straight. Any advice to better myself?",

I\u2019ve had to cut a friend because they\u2019d want to be pos n just say \u201csorry I\u2019m just depressed blah blah blah\u201d but if I were to ever act remotely similar i wouldn\u2019t hear the end of it as \u201cI shouldn\u2019t put it on them just because I\u2019m in a bad mood\u201d. For the one I kept because they r relatively fair, I just remember how they are there for me and that they are my close friend so I should realize that they are down rn n it\u2019s not them",

Like I love them but they are so draining and not even that but they try to make feel bad and are mean to be. \n\nI know I shouldn\u2019t accept it because it\u2019s not all depressed people who do that. But I still feel conflicted/ tired of being taken advantage of.",

When they start behaving in a way you don't feel is acceptable, there is a kind and compassionate way you can let them know, \"I want to be here for you and support you through what you're going through, but it hurts me when you do x, y and z, and I cannot always put up with that even though I know you're hurting. Is it OK if we can give each other some space to cool off when we're not able to express our feelings in a healthy way?\" And then list some ways you think you and your friends might agree are less eruptive ways to be there for each other. \nBy consistently separating yourself from them during these moments, they might initially accuse you of abandoning them, but give it some time before checking back. The consistency will show them that your boundaries don't necessarily mean you don't care for them. They'll come around to see that you're genuine in your support while also not allowing them to deflate you during their bouts. At least, I hope they'll see it. More importantly, you shouldn't tolerate mistreatment, it's not good for you and it's not good for them.",

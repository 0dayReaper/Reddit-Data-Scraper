Tried calling a hotline for the first time for a bit (non emergency) and even they couldn\u2019t answer me, probably too busy I guess, don\u2019t blame them. \n\nFeeling like this all alone and still can\u2019t even get a single stranger to just please listen to me for a single minute if anything. Man, this feels so horrible. Worst part is I can\u2019t even cry even though I want to. I just physically can\u2019t.",

    "postText": "I lost my job a few days ago and I broke up with my ex a few months ago. I\u2019ve fallen into a deep depression I cannot get out of. I\u2019ve even thrown around the idea of ending it in my head, which has never crossed my mind before. Having no hope anymore and being scared of the future is a awful feeling. I\u2019m writing this mainly to see if can get any advice to feel better or people going through something similar because I have nobody at the moment.",

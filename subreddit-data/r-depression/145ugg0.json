    "postText": "I'm tired. So very tired. I've been fighting it for so long that I can't even remember why anymore. My own desire was completely crushed last year when my mom died. I was 19. And ever since then I've been living only because the alternative would crush the people around me. But I'm starting to think in the long run they would be better off. The sum of my existence is suffering and the person they think I am is a lie anyways, so what truly would be lost. I am hollow and empty inside. I feel almost nothing constantly. I have moments of distraction where I feel almost human, but those come and go. The messed up part is that I have an amazing partner who I love more than life(which I suppose isn't saying much coming from me). She is caring and supportive and I couldn't ask for anyone better. And yet I couldn't feel more alone. I have loving friends and family, and I still feel so devoid of anything. A lot of it is my fault. I mask my pain so they don't have to be burdened by it. But I've opened up sincerely and truthfully on a number of occasions, but it never goes anywhere. I've blatantly asked for help. I've told them exactly what I'm writing here. The conversations themselves feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle just to get them to understand how bad it is, and even when I think this time they'll finally get it, the conversation ends and I never hear about it again. No asking how I'm doing. No check ins. Nothing. So I've stopped bothering. Just put on a smile and they'll think it's all okay. I know they aren't trained to deal with this kind of stuff. I don't expect anyone to sweep in and fix my damage. But some help would make everything so much more manageable. But it doesn't matter. I'm alone. I've accepted that. \n\nI've tried booking therapy, but so many places were booked and it became impossible to find anyone that I didn't have to wait 3 months to see. I eventually caved last month and I have an appointment at the end of July. But I'm not sure I'm going to make it that long. Which is why I suppose I'm here. My own best friend stopped messaging me, and yet here I am posting to a bunch of strangers, asking for help. My last bit of hope I guess. It's a funny thing; I've never wanted to stop existing more than in this moment, and yet I've never had this much strength in holding on and resisting that urge. A funny dichotomy. It's miserable. I wish I could just choose between one and be done with it. I'm tired of fighting. I don't care if I win or lose this battle, as long as it ends. But for the sake of my mom and all those who I've made promises to, I'm giving the win one more shot. No one can say I didn't try.\n\nI also hope no one relates to this. I know it's inevitable, especially considering I've read other posts similar to this and related to them. But I'll still hope anyways. I wouldn't wish this kind of pain on any other person, and I hope I'm the only person in the world who ever has to experience it. Which is dumb to ever think would be the case, but one can hope right?\n\nI'm not even sure what it is I hope to get out of writing this down. I guess a record of my mental state in case something does happen. At least there's proof. Or maybe I'm holding out hope that someone will have some magical cure for my sorrows. Who knows. But at least I did it. I made an attempt.\n\nI'm going to go to bed now.\n\nThank you for anyone who takes the time to read this. It is very much appreciated",

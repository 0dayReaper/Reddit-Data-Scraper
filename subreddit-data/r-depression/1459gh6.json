    "postText": "I was always weird. Even as a kid.\n\nMy parents had me when they were just kids in their early 20s and having only known each other for three months. I was around them while they growing up too. Their young friends would come over to our house to hang out I would listen to them talk and watch them drink a lot. I picked up on very little of the meaning of their words, but the energy I felt was all the intoxication I needed as a little one. I vividly remember so many times these \"adults\" admonishing themselves after saying something inappropriate in front of me. They would say I was so quiet that they forgot I was there. They would say I'm mature for my age. They would say that I was a good kid. It felt good to be accepted and included by the adults.\n\nAfter the housing crisis we moved around a lot. I think it was our 4th house/apartment move, and 3rd school district change in 5 years when I was in 7th grade at a new school. I was friendless and didn't know how to socialize with people my own age. I didn't really understand social cues and was extremely naive because I was the oldest of three kids and was the most sheltered by far. I was bullied heavily and then would come back home to my parents screaming at each other. After they separated, I'd come back home to a violent drunk despite custody switching between them every week. I stopped depending on or trusting anyone. There were no more tears anymore, that was a weakness to be exploited. Everybody was now a threat first until proven otherwise.\n\nThe only people I really cared about were my two younger siblings and even then, I didn't protect them. I hid and blocked out the world around me. I wouldn't leave safety unless I absolutely needed to. Safety being either my room, a closet, or the bathroom. But I still had to go to school. I looked up online how to seem more confident, how to be likeable, how to not be weird (I was, most certainly, still weird). And I would don the mask of an abrasive person that doesn't care what anybody thinks and would say horrible things everyday for a laugh. I had a degree of separation from the bullying, from the broken home, and from my failures even outside my safe areas. At least that was the idea. In reality I was hyper-conscious of everyone around me. Making sure I left the correct impression, that I wasn't awkward (I still was and I hated myself for it), that I gave off the right \"vibe\", that people thought the exact things I wanted them to think about me. I was miserable, but the control I felt was was better than the turmoil the rest of my life was.\n\nTime went on, I found a friend group and specific people within the group that I truly love and cherish. I started to open up and show bits of my real personality to them and wasn't rejected. But I couldn't bear to get rid of the mask completely. I was convinced that the \"real\" me was unlovable and I was still scared to get hurt.\n\nMy parents got back together my freshman year of highschool and seemed to be doing a lot better. For the first in many years there was some peace in my life at home. But I had new lessons burned into me. So I still hid. But they were more insistent on being a part of my life, so I just went with their flow, whatever they wanted to do. Never adding my input or thoughts on any matter. Least of all on the matters concerning me. If I just agreed with them they'd leave me alone; as long as I didn't want anything, I could breathe.\n\nJunior year came around and this is when I finally felt like I was becoming someone I could like. I felt more secure in my real self. I felt like people could actually accept me. I was working out, playing sports, getting good grades, and even had some ideas for what I wanted to do for college. I finally felt like I found a lane for myself. I was feeling so good that I even thought I could handle having a girlfriend. Which helped me get over my weirdness when it came to touching people and letting people touch me. And yet, I was still miserable. I couldn't understand it, but I was determined to push through and really improve myself. Then covid happened.\n\nIf I'm honest, I don't know exactly what happened. I don't know if I got complacent after feeling like I finally belonged somewhere. Or if my whole goal was to fit into my school environment and nothing else. Either way, the isolation messed me up. I couldn't ignore the past when the only company I had was myself 90% of the time. I didn't want to confront it, I wanted it to be over and done. But the consequences still showed. I stopped really caring about school. I didn't develop my plans for college at all really, besides wanting to get out of state and do a smart-sounding course that people would think, \"that makes sense for him\". People thought engineer would suit me so that's what I told everybody I'd do. I took the path of least resistance again.\n\nSomehow I managed to balance having a new girlfriend through the pandemic and I graduate. I go away to the college of \"my choice\" with a scholarship. I get there and within three weeks I was back home. I have not made any progress with college since.\n\nI realized that I didn't want to actually do college because it felt exactly like highschool. And I didn't even realize how much of my motivation to do well academically was so that I could get out of highschool and go to a good college. I was told that it was completely different. The only difference between highschool and college was that I had the added stress of needing to keep good grades or I lost my scholarship and would go into horrible debt. I turned down all invites from the people in my dorm because I was so laserfocused on school. I was all alone, in a place I had no attachment to, studying for things I didn't care about, and the thought of unimaginable debt weighing on me. And it was then that I thought, \"Why am I even doing this?\". I hadn't thought to ask myself that question. I had done almost everything by following the path of least resistance. If I stayed for any longer I would miss out on the full refund the college would give for both dorms and tuition, so I had to decide if I wanted to finish out the semseter or go back home quickly.\n\nI came back home. My parents divorced for real this time two years later. And I've been living with my dad for 3 years working for his company. I tried to do community college in the beginning but couldn't muster the drive to finish even one class after 4 seperate attempts. Each time with a lighter load until it was just one class at the end and even still I didn't try. So I just decided to work after that. I've broken up with my girlfriend of 3 years a while ago (also my first girlfriend) because I couldn't handle the responsibility of caring for anyone else's mental health when I'm falling apart at the seams.\n\nI can't even share anything else that has happened because my life has been a constant loop of nothing ever since.\n\nThe more I reminisce the more stupid I feel because I realize that I haven't actually changed at all. I've stayed the kid that craves acceptance from the people around him but convinced myself that I wasn't. That I had grown. But that was never true, it was all delusion on my part. That delusion kept me stagnant all the way up until now.\n\nThe worst part is I don't know how to get out of this. I don't know how to want for myself. And instead of going with the flow again and doing what others tell me, all I \"want\" now is to be left alone to rot. Because I feel like that's the only thing I have control over. I hate myself with every fiber of my being and see no way out of this hole I've continued to dig. I can't even muster the courage to end it.\n\nThe only solace I have are my core group of friends because, coincidentally, they all ended back home as well. Either by their own choice to go to the local community college or after trouble at other colleges. But they're all going away so soon. I'll have nobody. I hate going out if it's not with my friends and I have no way of meeting new people. I can't go to bars, I can't afford a gym membership, I hate concerts and parties because I'm so socially awkward and anxious. This isn't just \"nerves\" I've had panic attacks at gatherings where I've known and was on good terms with basically everybody there.\n\nAnd yet people want to see me \"flourish\" and I hate them for it. I hate them for putting that on me without seeing that my back is already in splinters and the only thing holding me up are my friends who are all going to be gone soon. I can't open up to them because I am still terrified that if they know how broken I am that they'll hate me. Because I've lied for so long. I am not a good person. I've done horrible things to people that I can't forgive myself for.\n\nAnd I can't leave because I'm still afraid for my little siblings. I have to be around for them during this terrible time incase my parents decide to indulge their old habits again. I'm stuck.\n\nSo that's who I am. An almost 21 year old whose only prospect is to just accept that I'm a shut in until I get the guts to be done with this life.",

Now it's just rejections, ghosting and just straight up being ignored. While being in love with a friend I can never have.\n\nShould have clarified that but there ya go. She's a really nice and incredible person even though she and I barely hang out at all compared to her family and her boyfriend. I honestly just latch on to the suffering of being in love with my best friend who I can never have. Not that she was interested in me in the first place.\n\nI've been rejected and ignored for so long that I rather just die and not be a burden to everyone. I'm in massive debt and no energy or motivation to even work as an Uber Delivery driver. That's how bad of a pit I'm in. She knows this and she doesn't know how to help cause who else would anyways? It's a difficult situation to deal and help with.\n\nI just feel empty, happiness is extremely fleeting for me. I barely feel it. I can't even remember the good times I've had, instead I remember terrible things I've done and dealt with... I honestly would rather die alone, or just lie down and rot.",

It doesn't matter how you write it. Perhaps, you want to use audio to record. Just keep writing or recording, say for a month. After a month, read/listen through it. You will find a pattern in those thoughts. You will often find a loop in which you are stuck in. Identifying that loop in which you are stuck is important. You might find some initial solution to come out of this loop. \n\nI can offer no other solution for coping. Meditation does help (I am not talking about fancy religious mumbo jumbo, just its techniques). Finally, don't depend on anyone for your happiness. Good Luck and Stay safe!",

He does not help me either, because he is a miser.  It's a weird, mixed up fuck up of a family, and you don't need to hear the whole sad tale.\n\nIt's also because I point out my siblings' flaws and weaknesses, I think.  They don't dare say anything stupid, because I am so quick to nail them on their stupidity and selfishness.  But all they can say are stupid things, so they get my wrath.\n\nAnyway, he's my Dad.  I have always thought it was a miracle that he and my Mom got together and made me.  If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be here commenting.  If it weren't for me, my Dad would have been long dead by now.  (Mom died fifteen years ago.  the last thing she said to me was that she hated Dad, and wished to be away froim him.  He's not a nice man.)\n\nIt seems that my only escape from this is his death.  Meanwhile, my only desire and direction is to keep Dad healthy, safe and comfortable.  It's a conundrum.\n\nYou sure know how to ask a loaded question, you know that?  I don't want to give you the TL;DR, OK?",

To make a long story short, she's half the reason why I don't even have hope/faith in the future; especially for  mines. \n\nShe was always overbearing and old school southern stubborn. When her health began to decline drastically five years ago, it began effecting me too. Beside dropping out of college and working jobs I hate (financial aid issue), taking care her and her stubborn ways made things grim for me. I felt like she robbed me of my twenties and I felt like I was in my thirties when I was in my mid to late twenties. Now I'm 30 and same thing is happening; but worst. Now with the Coronavirus, no job, plantar fasciitis and being stuck at home almost everyday, it making me hate her more and more. I'm depressed, my skills are beginning to lack, more irritable, snapping back slightly and overall, I lost so much interest in so much over the years that I just starting hating everything and everyone around me.\n\nBut she's my mother, and I'm her only child and she's my room and board so. Even though I get excited when she have to stay in the hospital for several days, I hate seeing her in pain. I don't want to severe the relationship, but I am thinking about leaving her behind either method no use, she is draining me.",

To get accused of lying by a friend is adding even more stress and makes sense that she'd want to take some time from you. Regardless choice is entirely yours if you wanna reach out, but this sounds salvageable. Just be understanding and hopefully she'll understand you too",

I sort of had this, but in fairness I think I should\u2019ve dealt with it better.\n\nI can think of an episode before I hit rock bottom, but I was definitely on the way down. At the time, I didn\u2019t see it or recognise it, and even when I recognised my depression, it still took years to understand what went on. I only understood once I realised I had Aspergers.\n\nBut going back to the Episode, and this was about 20 years ago now. A friend at the time really wanted to go to this club, and was on at me to go, so I said I would. I was having a bad time and the energy was just draining out of me. On top of that I\u2019d been working all week in a job that was really hitting my mental health, and I got to the end of that week and I was burnt out. I didn\u2019t have the energy to get out of bed and communicate. I couldn\u2019t even really explain what was going on to myself, let alone think about it enough to be able to explain to ANYONE. I didn\u2019t have the energy to think at all. I was living at home. I hadn\u2019t told my Mam of my original plans, so she wasn\u2019t there to prompt me. I was scared because it was the first time I\u2019d experienced this. I told my Mam I\u2019d been drinking after work and had a hangover. So obviously I left my friend dangling outside this nightclub and he wasn\u2019t best pleased. My Mam took a message from him, he was angry and never wanted to speak to me again.\n\nI felt disgusted in myself. I felt embarrassed about the phone call my Mam had taken, but I had no energy and couldn\u2019t explain what was happening or why to myself let alone my Mam, or my friend or anyone.\n\nAs far as I was concerned I was a disgusting person, and a failure and I didn\u2019t deserve to have friends.\n\nWe never did speak again, and I still feel shitty about that.\n\nI know how to cope with depression now and that helps with my Aspie Burnouts - I do think the two are linked.\n\nI don\u2019t have a lot of friends, but I do have a couple. If we were going out and I\u2019d cry off, I\u2019d tell them and they\u2019d get a bit pissed off at first, and they\u2019d be \u2018 come out for a drink, it\u2019ll do you good!\u2019 or \u2018You need to come out of your shell!\u2019 But because I knew what was happening, I felt I was able to fore warn them, because I was managing my burnouts.\nAs time went on, I was able to explain a bit more. I still don\u2019t think they fully understand, but we\u2019re all in our 30s and 40s now, so they\u2019re more accepting - and when we do go out, it\u2019s a bit quieter. Not out as late and. one or two pubs and or meals rather than big pub crawls or nightclubs, which I find much easier.\n(That\u2019s not a hatred of large crowds by the way, I\u2019ve been going to Football matches since I was a kid without any problems and I\u2019m OK with gigs too. But I\u2019ve always felt lost and out of control in places like nightclubs, they have triggered one or two meltdowns.)",

If you don\u2019t take medication, you really should consider it.    \n\nI stopped taking a certain depression med a few years ago for blood pressure reasons, but I thought it was no longer working, and wanted to see if I could live without it. I still took an anxiety med, and I thought it would be good enough.     \nI didn\u2019t change all at once, but over the years my path felt darker and darker. I should have taken the hint something was wrong when I got fired from a job I was at for 15 years, because I abused Fmla. I 100% take responsibility for that. I just couldn\u2019t get out of bed hardly. And I have other health issues that make me tired on top of that, so I figured it was more due to that illness than anything mentally. I was wrong.    \n\nIt\u2019s just that my mind comes up with wack excuses to not do things when it\u2019s off balance. I just imagine the worst things right off the bat.\nI continued to struggle to survive, until a little while ago I finally had enough. I felt so despondent. I am lucky to have a few friends and a SO, but what was I to them but a fleeting face once in a while?    \n\nI don\u2019t like depending on others. Especially for depression issues, because I don\u2019t want to bring other people down with my brain\u2019s bs. Because to me, that\u2019s what it is- part of it is growing up in an unstable household, and part of it is genetics.     \n\nI didn\u2019t want to depend on meds either. But it was either that or drown in darkness. And I realized from taking the med hiatus for depression that I can\u2019t not have chemical help. And so be it. I deserve to be a whole individual, not a ghost.\n\nIt\u2019s been 3 weeks since I started on depression meds again, and I feel different already. Placebo or no, I don\u2019t care. I left my house for the first time socially in 8 months. It felt great. One small leap, sure, but a world of difference to me.\n\nNow I am thinking about switching careers too. Maybe I need to plug myself into learning something totally new and something that could benefit me in the future. Even if it doesn\u2019t work out, I\u2019m going for it. \n\nBecause now my thought is: it only has a chance if I give it one. \n\nThere\u2019s no way my brain could have believed that before. So I say to whomever is reading this: you CAN get help- something to give you a hand up and start helping YOURSELF. So you can really be present when you\u2019re with other people. \n\nSo you can stop struggling for air and finally begin to walk, so that yes- you can RUN!",

I thought this was to talk about the possiblility of looking for places to play.   \nthis wasn't the case, as soon as the 'leader' arrived he said that collectivly they where going to remove me from the band. The reason was that I was using depression as an excuse to slack off during the week and they couldn't rely on me. This was a huge blow to my self esteem. it took years to gain any confidence to play music again. I have only just started to pick my bass guitar up.   \n\n\nNeedless to say, I'm better off with out those people in my life. silver linings and all that.   \n\n\nSorry for bad grammer.   \n\n\nTLDR; got kicked out of band because depression.",

We've had more than one or two arguements regarding this very same reason. And even though they've told me the reason behind it, I didn't realize just how much until I saw this post.

I would call them up to vent or to say how horribly depressed I feel. They would try to give me advice but it never worked. It's not their fault. I didn't realise I was using them as a counselor. So they were obviously getting frustrated with me constantly being negative and no matter what they suggested it didn't work. Also me canceling plans didn't help. I realised what I was doing and went looking for professional help asap. My friends and family were still there to support me but I had a counselor to dump my problems and feeling on to.  It seemed to work. My family seemed less frustrated and actually understanding and same with my friends. They didn't quite understand what I was going through since none of them ever had depression. however they finally understood i was going through something that doesn't have a quick fix.   I've been dealing with depression for about 10 years. It's and uphill battle that sometimes you just don't care if you win.  Stay strong and don't be afraid to get professional help.",

I think a good step is to open up to a trusted, responsible( preferably adult) person, whether that be a counselor, hotline, or someone more local in your community (teacher, mentor, etc.) about what's going on so you can get proper care. Oftentimes,  family and friends don't understand, and they certainly can't if never told what's going on. I can't guarantee that it's easy or that they'll understand right away, but it's a good step. Only when you're down will you find who's really there for you and who you should keep in your life.\n\nAlso self-care! Drink water, sleep/nap, cry, distract self with music, there are tons of coping methods and they vary from person to person. Ultimately the goal is to improve your life, but it's a rocky journey that takes...your life (like years minimum to see big change). However that doesn't mean you have to be stuck here forever, and you certainly won't unless you choose the worst route.\n\nDon't wait for it to get worse!  You are all deserving of love, but you are the only one in your life who has your best interests at ehart. And can make the changes to walk a better route. Have faith in something, whether that's the future, God, or even a tree. \n\nThere's a lot we can't control, but there's also a lot we CAN do in our lives. Please find the things you can deal with, your actions, reactions/thoughts/emotions, bits of your environment, who you associate with, who you listen to. it might feel like no way out, but realize feelings are fleeting, and a deadly permanent solution to a temporary problem won't help. Once you realize you can change your life for the better, use that power to your advantage, however long or late in life it may be.\n\nMay the gods above bless you all. (You've all prayed to the homework gods at some point when an assignment is due late don't lie). As Anna from Frozen 2 would say, I believe in you, more than anyone or anything.",

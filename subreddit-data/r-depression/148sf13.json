            "comment": "Sounds like she might be struggling with postpartum depression.\n\n[https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/postpartum-depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20376617](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/postpartum-depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20376617)\n\nShe might *feel* she's losing *control*, and then *feel* guilty for bringing a child into the world, she *feels* she cannot take care of on her own child, and so she *feels* like a bad mother, and then *feel* guilty about being a burden to you.\n\nI would suggest to remind her that this is untrue. But not in a systematic way. Look at how she's behaving and what she is feeling.\n\nAsk her how she is doing. Ask her if she is feeling this or that... Be sympathetic - that sounds though, i.e.\n\nTell her that she's a good mom, and that you care for her, and appreciate her.\n\nAsk how you can help, and show her that you want to help because it makes you glad.\n\nTell her to take care of her self. Do stuff with her, that might bring her into a better mood.\n\nRemind her about all the good things about her kid. Like how they behave, etc.\n\nTry to get her to talk about her feelings, listen more then you talk, and see if she gets any help from a professional.\n\nRead a bit about maybe a famous person who had postpartum depression, and is a good mom now, so you have that in your back hand if that discussion should come up. Talk about people you know with mental health issues, who gets help, and has gotten better. Meaning she should not feel ashamed for getting help.\n\nDon't do this forcefully, but more or less naturally and genuinely. Of course it will be hard to get into it at first. And do not be overwhelming with either, gradually and step by step, so she doesn't feel cornered or suffocated.\n\nDon't do this all on your own though, so you should talk to the rest of the family as well. But if she senses any shenanigans, she might feel even worse about herself. \n\nI think women would be of most help, but not anyone who would shame her.",

It's something extra. Your responsibility is you first and foremost, and this is not your fault.\n\nYou should not feel alone in this, and you shouldn't be alone. \n\nYou should maybe try to talk to someone at school? Even if you're a minor, you should get support for your mental health. Especially in this situation. So try to find a person you can speak to outside this situation, who has a trustful character.\n\nYour sister needs to be open about how she is feeling in therapy - and you need to tell her that you love her and are concerned for her, but that you believe in her and that things will work out.\n\nYou need to believe it yourself also, okay?\n\nYour mom loves your sister, so I would trust her in that she is doing everything she can to her best ability, alright?\n\nBut try to get her to understand. Cry to her about it even, and don't give up on that.\n\nYou need to be patient in the situation, but you are very kind for caring this much.",

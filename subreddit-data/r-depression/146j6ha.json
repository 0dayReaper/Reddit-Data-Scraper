I haven\u2019t cut myself in almost a month and ive made a few friends but i haven\u2019t gotten better at all. now it\u2019s summer and i\u2019m probably spending it all alone. i\u2019m constantly dissociating. A few months ago i was so adamant about getting better but now i just don\u2019t care anymore. i\u2019m just a worthless, stupid, hypersexual whore. i wish that i\u2019d just stop having to experience everything and not have responsibilities. i wish that my parents weren\u2019t blind, bigoted, religious pieces of shit and they would just get me a therapist. I wish that i could just have a normal childhood.",

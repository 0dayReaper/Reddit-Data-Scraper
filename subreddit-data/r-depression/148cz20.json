    "postText": "hi, I've been taking antidepressants for almost 2 years now and still no progress. I first started with one drug and now I have three antidepressants. I feel sick when I swallow almost a handful of medicine in the morning. I want to run away from all the people and live in the forest without people. I don't want to live if my life looks like this",

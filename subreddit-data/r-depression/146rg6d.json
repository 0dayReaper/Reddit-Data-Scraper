    "postText": "Im 18. I have my life ahead of me but i dont want it. Ever since i got raped i cant get myself back together. I became a drug addict at 13. Just trying to cope somehow. I never told anyone and its been eating me up inside. I lost my father to cancer a few months ago. My girlfriend dumped me right after my father died to be someone else. I dont know why i deserve this. \n\nIv been thinking about ending it for months now. I tried and i couldnt. One day i know ill have the strength to do it and its getting closer everyday. I cant wait to perish from this fucked up hell hole called earth. I want to vanish.",

That may alleviate some of the shitty feelings. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry about your gf. Heartbreak will def make you question your existence.",

But since you are so young.. i hope better things are up ahead for you. \nI feel you should never end your life because of what happened to you..what people did to you. Because it will be you who is still paying the price. \nTry to share your feeling with a person..anyone ....trust me ..it helps. \nThe thoughts eating you up inside are fighting you to come out. \nSending hugs.",

You chest hurts..endless crying..constant thoughts. Even if you catch yourself laughing...or even smiling for a moment ..a voice in your head says you are not supposed to be happy. Every other persons life feels so nice..you think atleast they happy. \nI was going through this same thing a year ago. You just don't trust anyone or anything anymore. Anger..you feel betrayed. \nI was 26 ..like i thought that's it. A friend and love of 14 years ended. There is no point now. \nPeople keep telling me \" it's gonna be ok\" \"everything is a lesson\".\n\nThe biggest thing that helped me was time. And just sharing this with some other friends. \n\nI know therepy is very big..i haven't been to it myself. \nIt might help in some way. \n\nBut ya..the feelings of sadness ..it will surely dim with time. I can guarantee that. But it definitely changes you. \nHopefully for good.",

Currently I wanna die.. but this feeling will pass. The deep need to die passes. It\u2019s a lie from the pit of hell. Every time I wanna die I have to tell myself THE DEVIL WANTS ME DEAD. And I pray to God for whatever o need to get through the feeling.. I pray for the feeling to never come back.. but.. here it is again, I wanna die. I have a 1 year old and a 6 year old. A family who loves me.. nothing matters when you feel like this. It\u2019s so sad :,(",

It has helped me immensely to begin to overcome trauma. I can\u2019t imagine your pain rn but it is possible to overcome. My mom physically and sexually abused me and my dad just let it happen. I wanted to die everyday because it felt like my existence was meaningless and worthless and I felt alone in a cold, dark world. I have made it to a place where I am stable, but I still have horrible days that being suffering mentally and physically. Life really just screws you hard and having depression on top of that makes it hard to press on. If you feel you are completely alone push through the darkness even if you\u2019re doing it for yourself.",

If you fight back, life will get better man. If you\u2019re able to, please consider seeking professional help. I was stuck in hell for 7 years because I was too afraid to get help. Most of the doctors and therapists I\u2019ve worked with are genuinely concerned with helping me overcome the trauma, pain, hurt, numbness, loneliness, etc.",

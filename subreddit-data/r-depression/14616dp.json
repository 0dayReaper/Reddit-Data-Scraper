It sounds like an easy way out\u2026 but I assure you\u2026 Your body lasts way longer than you\u2019d expect\u2026and the discomfort will be unbearable. \n\nPlease find some help. Your cat loves you\u2026.",

All of this\u2026 is in your head. You are constantly telling yourself a story. And the more you repeat \u201cI hate myself\u201d the easier it is for your brain to find that thought path again\u2026 it\u2019s Grooved into our brains. Don\u2019t give up\u2026 **Learn to use your mind**. Force yourself to keep trying. \n\nLife gets easier. As you get older You\u2019ll be surprised how the things you thought mattered just don\u2019t anymore and you\u2019ll wonder why you even thought that way. \n\nYou can figure this out. Have hope. You have a purpose\u2026 you just haven\u2019t found it yet\u2026 and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone.",

When people stare and ask questions\u2026 keep telling them it\u2019s a dog. \n\nGo have fun. Life is about finding moments. It\u2019s never All bliss\u2026 it\u2019s not supposed to be. Happiness isn\u2019t a destination. Happiness is the way there\u2026 to me Happiness is \u201cgetting better at things\u201d. If I\u2019m not practicing something and getting better I slowly fade\u2026 \n\nWhat is happiness to you? Go figure it out. Go out and fail. Fail A lot. It doesn\u2019t matter. Learn and move on\u2026 it\u2019s what all those other \u201cnormals\u201d are doing. You just \u201cthink\u201d everyone isn\u2019t like you and they love everything and don\u2019t have regrets. That\u2019s just not true. The older I get the more I realize that everyone is so much more similar to eachother. I bet you there is someone Right now\u2026 talking to their cat\u2026 go find those people. They may have more in common with you than you think.\n\nStop being afraid. A suicidal person has literally nothing to lose. What are you afraid of? Go out into the world\u2026go help someone. Go find a person you can make laugh, or who makes you laugh. Killing yourself can always be a fall back plan\u2026 go force yourself to try stuff. Life gets easier. Don\u2019t give up yet.",

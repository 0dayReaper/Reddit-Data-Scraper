    "postText": "My husband and I worked all week, but we paid our necessary bills and now we are broke again; we haven\u2019t even bought groceries. Now it\u2019s the weekend and I have to Doordash. My 19-year-old daughter practically lives at her friend\u2019s house because the house is so cluttered we can\u2019t even function (or just barely). I don\u2019t blame her for not wanting to be here, but it breaks my heart. And I can tell the cat feels neglected. I\u2019m so tired all the time and depressed that all I want to do when I finally get home is collapse into bed. I feel like I\u2019m just working to survive. And for what? To live another day where all I do is work, never get to do anything fun? Never have enough money to travel or buy anything? Never have any money to go out with family or friends, buy clothes, get my nails done, take my daughter to the movies? WHAT IS THE POINT OF LIFE???? I would rather not be here, and that is the truth. I am spending every waking moment doing things I DO NOT WANT TO DO.",

            "comment": "You're going to get through this, and \"never\" is a long time.  As far as the clutter goes, don't think about how big a job it is.  Find something that seems easiest to deal with in bite-sized pieces (even if it's only five minutes at a time), and know that if you're consistent, eventually it'll change.  It doesn't have to be a lot - take out the trash, put some silverware in the dishwasher, find a couple of things that can be thrown away, etc. I'm sometimes in the same headspace, and I often have to MAKE myself do stuff because of the utter lack of motivation.  I've learned that I can only do what I can do, and to tell myself that I've done all I can for the moment.  Give the cat a bit of attention and let him/her know you still care - it doesn't take a lot, and it'll probably help you feel better.  I know it's really rough when you're exhausted from a day at work, so don't feel like you have to commit tons of time - every little bit helps.\n\nMost of all, try to keep in mind that just because this is the way things are now doesn't mean they'll always be this way.  It sucks feeling like you're using all your energy just to keep your head above water, so cut yourself a break - you've got the bills paid, and you're accomplishing more than you think you are even when it feels like you're working yourself to exhaustion.  It's hard to see that objectively when you feel spent all the time, but that doesn't mean it's not true.  Depression distorts how we see ourselves, and keeps us from seeing what we've truly gotten done.  You made it into work all week, and that's a pretty damn good achievement by itself.\n\nI hope this doesn't come across as seeming trite or not understanding of what that kind of bleakness feels like - I've felt it many times myself, so this is just offered as something that helps for me when it feels like I can't do any more and there's nothing to look forward to.",

I really appreciate you taking the time to write this to me. I\u2019m sure there are others like me who will also benefit from reading it. God Bless",

    "postText": "I know I'm depressed. Family will say no your not depressed your just being dramatic... Is it being dramatic when you always cancel plans with everyone and make up excuses when honestly your just gonna stay in bed with the tv on in the background hoping it can silence your thoughts. Is it dramatic to suddenly bust into tears when just a moment ago you were laughing. To fantasize suicide and feel worse because you honestly believe no one cares. To have a boyfriend who is soo in love with you and wishes to be intimate but your too depressed. Is it dramatic to say how stressed you are? How you haven't had your period for 7 months already cause of stress. How your mom ingrained into you to always care about what others think of you and now that your latest depression wave caused you to gain weight, you feel horrible.\n\nI know I should seek out help but honestly it's just hard getting out of bed.",

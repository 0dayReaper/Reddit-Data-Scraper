    "postText": "everyday I wake up it\u2019s a battle for me fight to stay here. Anyone else feel like that? I hate when the birds chirp because it reminds me of the when people use the morning to start their day for a fresh start, but for me it\u2019s another day I must face to fight myself from being here. I never realized how disconnected I am from being drowned in the mud of dark ness. I find peace in darkness and bad habits  to be able to feel I have some control. I know I\u2019m different from others, very different. I\u2019m 20, and still think and feel like I\u2019m a kid. A kid crying for help. A kid crying for guidance. A kid crying for sympathy. A kid crying for hope. Anyways that\u2019s my little rant of the day. I will be writing on here it makes me feel better to be able to express my thoughts and the way I feel. I hope everyone has a good day\ud83d\udc99",

What I mean is that I stay up as late as possible wasting time because I know that if I go to sleep, I\u2019ll wake up and have to go to school. I usually go to bed at around 3:30am and get up at 6am and it\u2019s destroying me, I\u2019ve been doing this for months and I\u2019m physically weak and exhausted constantly because of it but my depression and anxiety demand it. And they always seem to get their way. \n\nEdit: I\u2019m really glad that this spoke to so many people, it feels good knowing I\u2019m not alone. Sending lots of love to you all. This isn\u2019t easy but I believe in you \u2764\ufe0f",

Two months ago that was precisely my catastrophic perpetual cycle, I\u2019d keep trying not to fall asleep because of how annoyed and sad I am. I didn\u2019t want to face the day after, it\u2019s like staying up meant that I won\u2019t think about things as much as the day after, like even though I\u2019m still thinking about them, I\u2019m prolonging them. That would be sort of therapeutic and give me the slightest amount of piece of mind.\nYet whenever I told anyone who asked that I couldn\u2019t sleep, they\u2019d understand cause it\u2019s such a seemingly valid and acceptable excuse, but I would know, I\u2019d know that I\u2019m being an exaggerative retard that doesn\u2019t even deserve to have the luxury of their compassion. I lost 8kg that month I think and sleep was kind of a non existent commodity to me, still definitely wasn\u2019t depressed, I was probably just being a fucking baby anyway. \nI now have exams that will determine my future so even though I\u2019m barely studying, at least my mind is almost off the rest just enough to help me study (sometimes). I still hate waking up though, I\u2019ll have to face my responsibilities, which I most probably won\u2019t even fucking deal with. ",

When I graduated from undergrad and had a summer off, I'd sleep later and later each night until I got back onto the \"normal\" day schedule. When I finally got a job, it was on the night shift, so my nights were more people-filked than my days were (and even then, I had problems falling asleep on time so I could get up for work). \nAnd after working nights for a year, I really think that being awake at night is more of a hassle. Insurance office isn't open at 3a and I won't be clear headed enough at 9a to ask them a billing question, I can't have Chinese food delivered, I can't play a movie too loudly or I'll wake my downstairs neighbor... The list goes on",

Working shifts doesn\u2019t help either because I can never get into a regular cycle. Some days I don\u2019t work, some days it\u2019s daytime and sometimes I don\u2019t leave until 2am. \n\nTo help this I keep OTC Sleeping pills with me. Only use them 3ish times a week at most to avoid building tolerance and making them useless. Also smoking weed helps a lot if it\u2019s legal or obtainable in your state/country. But not drinking. Studies show it makes sleep worse and overdoing it causes hangovers. \n\nAlso if you need to use your phone before bed, using the night mode helps. Don\u2019t know if it\u2019s placebo but it feels easier on my eyes and helps me sleep. Some people find it easier not to use the phone at all but watching some mindless YouTube video or browsing reddit makes me sleepy. Staring at the walls does not (for me)",

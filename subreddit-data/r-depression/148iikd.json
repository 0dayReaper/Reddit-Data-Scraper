    "postText": "Since I literally have no one around me to talk to about this and any one else I've told this to refuses to understand or actually care, I guess this is the next place to go. \n\nDoes anyone else know of that 'spark' in your soul?\n\nThe 'spark' that you feel when you get excited for things? When you anticipate something? When something you are clamoring for is near its arrival and you can do nothing but feel that spark getting brighter and hotter until you finally have what you've been excited for and that spark becomes a flame of victory and fulfillment?\n\nI can feel the spark, continuing to click and attempt to ignite, but I can never make the spark become a full-fledged flame...\n\nThe news of a new video game realizing that I've wanted for years...\n\nClick, click, click...\n\nNews about a new addition to the family...\n\nClick, click, click...\n\nThe prospect of going on a trip or vacation...\n\nClick, click, click...\n\nGetting a raise at work...\n\nClick, click, click...\n\nThe spark keep trying to light the pilot, but no flames can be produced.\n\nNothing excites me.\n\nNothing makes me feel joy or elation or giddiness in any capacity.\n\nIt's all just news that's unimportant to me.\n\nI've told everyone I ever knew of this issue but everyone keeps on the the same refrain; 'you'll be fine', 'you'll get over it', 'it'll come back to you' or 'get over yourself and stop being a bitch'.\n\nI think I've heard it all.\n\nI've taken antidepressants. Loads of them. Probably 4 different pill combinations, all of which never worked and 1 of which almost killed me dead. Lol\n\nI've talked to psychologists, and they were no better than those telling me to get over it. They would nod and pry to get to the bottom of my issues but always came up short in every way.\n\nI've even gone the way of religion, thinking that if I could possibly hear something from God themselves, I could possibly find clarity and peace.\n\nNothing.\n\nWorks.\n\nIm not posting this for attention, nor is it expected for anyone to respond or try to understand my plight.\n\nIt's gotten so bad that I don't think I'll ever move forward past this deficit. I am fully prepared to live the rest of my life feeling 'mid' or nothing about anything.\n\nChances are, perhaps I'm the only one with this particular issue, but I highly doubt it.\n\nAnd forgive the edgy nature of this, its probably the only way to describe how I'm feeling.\n\nMy apologies.",

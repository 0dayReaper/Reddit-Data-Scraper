    "postText": "i cant help but feel like a fuck up every day. whenever i try to do something good for myself or someone else, it never helps. i like helping people and being compassionate, and i tell myself that i dont want the credit or the recognition -- which is true -- but it would still be nice if people noticed how much i try to do for them. whenever i mess up or cause a bad situation, i put all my effort into fixing it. if someone else is having a hard day or feeling depressed, i will always try to help them feel better and loved. but besides my family every once in a while, no one else does it for me. my friends dont check up on me. people that i've been there for in the past dont check up on me. i always feel alone even though i have people who care about me.\n\ni dont know how to help myself. i've been in therapy for a couple years now and i tell myself it helps, but it doesnt. i put on a face every day for people so they dont worry and i try to reassure them that im alright, but i dont know how much longer i can do that for. i've contemplated suicide and i truly dont care about my own life anymore. the only thing stopping me is that i know it will taint any and every memory that my family will make after me. i know that my parents and grandparents would be mortified that they outlived me. my mom would be mad that i didnt tell anybody. i dont want to be a burden. i dont want people to worry, but i want people to care.\n\ni havent said anything to anybody, nor do i want to. thats why im posting this here. nobody will know who i am. nobody will recognize me. none of my family or friends go on here. i know that no one will read this or care. i just needed to say it.",

    "postText": "My natural shyness has devolved over the years into legitimate reclusive behavior. I avoid my roommates at all costs because they are all so normal and you can tell that they have been socialized very well during their childhood with a strong support system to help them develop into a normal person. They can talk for hours about any topic, be it politics, world events, sports, the economy, movies, actors, etc. When I first moved in, I made an effort to engage in conversation with them. I quickly realized that all my conversations with them centered around me asking dumb questions about whatever topic we were talking about. I feel like I know nothing about anything - even the most basic of things that most people would deem to be common knowledge. As a result, I rarely have anything to contribute in conversations. All conversations with them feel dull, and uninspired. Being the overly-observant human that I've become, as a result of my long history of being the \"quiet one\" who just listens in on conversations rather than actively engaging in them, I quickly began to notice that all interactions with me started to become a mere chore for them; something they wanted to get out of the way sooner than later, but also something they would try and avoid completely if given the opportunity. I recall instances where they would scurry into their rooms when they heard me coming down the stairs. The ever-growing inferiority complex I've developed over the years has never been so strong. The shame I feel whenever I interact with them never fails to make me want to crawl into my bed and contemplate my existence. Alas, it has been 3 months now that I have restricted myself to my tiny room for all hours of the day, only leaving to pick up my Uber eats because I can't bare the thought of using the kitchen to make food in fear of having to interact with my roommates. This is what my life has come to.\n\nWhen I see people like me - the quiet, reserved type - I tend to envy them because, despite their innate shyness, they often have a range of things that pique their interest. They are able to engage in meaningful conversations on a wide range of topics **if** they wanted to. Their introversion does not inhibit their ability to be curious about the world and seek out knowledge about what they do not know. I, on the other hand, genuinely have no deep interests that I care to foster and cultivate to make me a more well-rounded, interesting person. I've never done a formal IQ test, but all throughout my childhood I struggled in school, even nearly flunking out of high school. I am beginning to think that all the factors that have culminated into making me who I am today (innate shyness, immense social anxiety in classroom settings since grade school, latchkey kid, addicted to video games from a young age, severe lack of socialization) were heightened by the fact that I suffer from low IQ. As mentioned, I feel like shy kids that suffer from social anxiety like me tend to at least have the capacity to learn about and understand things about the world, even going out of their way to do research about things they are curious about. This ability alone gives them a path forward in life via academics - they can become computer scientists or follow some other career path that may require minimal social interaction; a path that allows them to garner fulfillment from their joy of learning about things rather than interacting with people. I feel as though that option is not available to me. Is my lack of curiosity just a byproduct of having low IQ? Is my indifference just a guise over what is truly just low intelligence? Or is all of what I'm saying just an insidious delusion that comes with not having undergone formal diagnoses for a plethora of mental illnesses stemming from a young age?\n\n\nI worry that my way of living will continue long into the future and that my reclusive behavior will only get worse with time. It is already very bad, but I know it can get much worse. I barely see sunlight nowadays and I can't remember the last time I opened my mouth to talk to another human being. I am only 24, but I feel like a senile old man that has nothing left to do in life but to reminisce about a life they never had.\n\nI am just rambling. Not sure what I am looking to get out of posting this. I just feel empty.",

So talking is just me using all my brain power to understand the subject. Then it quickly fades away. I was also a shy kid but I had a small group of friends that I grew up with at a young age. Nearly every day I was hanging out with them. So i don't know what happened but pretty much since becoming an adult I felt \"dumb\". Seems my brain can only retain my negative self talk.",

            "comment": "Being a recluse is not a bad thing, but you need to find the right balance for you. You need to feel connection - that's why you're feeling empty.\r  \n\r  \nHave you ever considered that you might not enjoy these topics \"normal\" people enjoy?\r  \n\r  \nIf so, there are many people just like you, who would rather discuss life and what's happening to them. They can be a bit hard to find though. Many people are open to it when they have had enough with their games.\r  \n\r  \nYou shouldn't feel left out because you come with \"stupid\" questions, if anything it would be a good exercise for them to explain exactly what they know. My guess is that they don't really understand it that much themselves, but are more interested in the game of it, and you unfortunately \"drag\" them down. So, these are really not your kind of people. Friends accept each other and pick each other up.\r  \n\r  \nYou are too concerned anyways about other people. In stead of envying the functioning introverts, you should look within to see what you can offer. I'm sure it's something. Being an observer, you're probably well attuned to other people's need and emotions, in any case. That's something - just don't become a people pleaser or anyone's therapist. Be smart about it, in stead.\r  \n \r  \nFrom how you are explaining yourself, you seem quite reflective. But you lack feelings of self-worth, self-respect, and self-confidence. I do not think you have a low IQ. Although playing video games and being reclusive are probably not helping your situation.\r  \n\r  \nYou should try to socialize with people who accept you for who you are. You don't suddenly become social, so some level of discomfort you need to accept. Just be honest, and let go of people who doesn't care about you. You could look up your personality type, to see if you find any answers there.\r  \n\r  \nI'm a quiet introverted observer myself. I don't have any interest in surfacelevel topics. I didn't do well in school, because I was bullied and things were not great at home - but I got through it because I'm smart. Also I'm an INFJ, and I tend to be caught in what other people are doing from a sensing perspective, which only translates as noise to me. When I feel bad about myself in addition, I tend to translate that noise as something being wrong with me. But in reality, I just need to feel connected by deep and honest conversations.\r  \n\r  \nGet outside, and get some air and sun every day. Don't feel comfortable around people? Watch people, or animals. Do some charity work or something. Get a bit exercise as well. Reading books might help on feeling lonely, and you would have something to talk about.\r  \n\r  \nIt will get better!",

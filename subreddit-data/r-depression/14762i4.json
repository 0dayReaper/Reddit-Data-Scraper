    "postText": "Sorry if my english is bad.I (18M)am  just not happy anymore. I always have this felling that my life is worth practicly nothing. My friends dont even ask me to come out anymore, we dont even play videogames together (they do, just not with me). I am going to school for a kindergarden teacher and I realised that I started to disslike kids in general and that is making it a nightmare. (I signed up for that school because at the time I wanted to be a history and geography teacher and that was supposedly the easiest way to reach that goal.) But since then I gave up on that dream and I am reminded of that everyday that i wake up. \nI am also not really phiseacly fit for anything, I hardly even climb the stairs to my appartment. (I am actually not fat, just really weak). My father is just a piece of shit. He is a local heavy drinker you could say and my mother kicked him out when I was 12. He refuses to pay childsupport, which makes it so we hardly make it through the month. We dont really ever go to bed hungry, but if a car breaks down or rent goes up it becomes a big problem. I always fell like shit my friends are also very toxic, like that time i reached out to them they told me to go KMS and started laughing. I despise half of them but, other half are good people, but they still hang out toghether. I had also become very socialy akward. I have trouble meeting new people and even with the people i knew from before i have problems talking to. Then there was this girl I liked and we became very good friends and when she broke up with her bf she came crying to me. That was the moment i fell in love with her, since she gave me a purpuse. But of course it would not be my life without shit falling apart. She got a new bf and my life was misereble again. I miss those days, since that was the time when I was generaly happy for once. And also here is another thing, my younger brother. When he and his friends started to hang out with my friends (at that time we were good friends, all of us) they started to replace me with him. I despise him for that. There is a lot more but I dont wanna write a novel. Please I need advice on where to go from here since i am lost and very lonely. Please",

            "comment": "Feeling physically weak may stem from vitamin or mineral deficiencies. Get a blood test, and then take supplements if the results show you have deficiencies. This will help your energy levels as well as your mental state\n\nFind something to work towards that is meaningful to you. For me it's my study in an area of great interest to me, as well as my desire to travel to a particular city that I find fascinating\n\nIt's ok to realise that studying to be a kindergarten teacher is not for you, it's a journey and you're learning about yourself. Take this information as feedback, not failure\n\nStrengthen your social skills by either reading books or watching Youtube videos on the topic\n\nI find practising mindfulness to be very helpful, as well as writing my thoughts and feelings down in a journal",

I sometimes find it hard to say the right words and as a result i ofter times just say something that sounds like it would be Yoda from star wars speaking or a random guy trying to speak french without knowing a word. Otherwise those are great advises of yours and i shall reflect on them.",

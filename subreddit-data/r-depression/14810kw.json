    "postText": "Last winter, I planned to shoot myself the day after Christmas. \n\nI got drunk at my favorite bar, drove to a gun store and just sat in the parking lot trying to force myself to walk inside. Since that day I\u2019ve been self harming every other night. My left arm is getting covered in scars that don\u2019t heal.\n\nI believe that I\u2019m too mentally ill to have a spouse or be a mother. So I struggle to find solid meaning in my life.\n\nAll my friendships end badly. Every romantic relationship I have been in ends badly. I\u2019m very lonely and it feels like my life constantly follows this pattern of getting something and then it eventually goes away in the end.\n\nOther people can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m lonely. That I am single and have almost no friends. People will tell me that I\u2019m \u201cpretty\u201d, \u201chot\u201d and \u201csmart\u201d. To me those are the most vapid and shallow compliments. They only like me because they like what they see on the outside and I have no idea what I\u2019m actually like on the inside. Nor do they actually care.\n\n\nIt hurts knowing that nobody really cares and any kindness is on this\u2026fake, superficial level. Across the last 15 years I have written thousands of pages over my life. Poetry, stories, diaries. And nobody will ever read them. Because nobody even wants to get to know me well enough to reach that point of closeness with me.\n\n\nThe only things that make me happy are writing, reading books and cosplaying at events like ComicCon.\n\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough to keep me alive. Maybe the next time I get drunk I\u2019ll actually be so intoxicated that I can finish the job next time.",

Forget ur looks, forget how smart u r, etc that shit don\u2019t matter. You\u2019ve got further progress to make. Thousands of pages of writing is impressive. Have u ever considered trying to pursue writing? I\u2019d be interested to hear about the books ur reading and while I\u2019m not a big comic or cosplay person I\u2019d be down to listen if u have no one else",

I guess I am considered what may be in societies terms of \u201cattractive\u201d, and it sucks struggling so much and majority cant get past the depths of outward appearances. They will one day fade. They don\u2019t fill the void in me. I am lonely too. I desire a spouse but I too don\u2019t want children. I\u2019m here if you\u2019d like to talk.. no judgment. You aren\u2019t alone in your feelings.. this world and life can be rough, hang in there please \ud83d\udc96",

Best continue the things you love and stop hurting yourself. I know it\u2019s hard but try to join groups online to talk to others, there\u2019s loads of people all over the world who are lonely",

By sharing my authentic self, kids gravitated to me.  It helped give me a purpose.   That purpose continues today as I still communicate with many of them and we are able to share in eachothers lives via social media.  \n\nI encourage you to find something bigger than yourself to help give you purpose.   Volunteering is a great way to start.  I could forsee you teaching interested people about writing.  \n\nGood luck.",

And when your life is REALLY on the line you can take 1000 more steps than that. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s going to be okay. Just keep looking forward. Focus on when where you are going and keep taking steps. Even if you don\u2019t know where you are going just keep going. If you fall or back track that\u2019s okay. Just refocus and keep moving. Love you \u2764\ufe0f",

I don\u2019t know if you have ever seen that commercial (for an antidepressant) where a woman has a paper plate in front of her face with a big smile and I TOTALLY understood. I have fought it for years and became very good at \u201cfaking it\u201d in my youth because I didn\u2019t want anyone to think I was stranger than I already was. Ha. As I got older I realized that more people than I realized have this.. affliction(?) that we share.  It is not fun, it is not easy but there are good ideas out there to help yourself in life\u2026 and life can actually turn out to be kind of fun.  For us, it takes work, but nice when you do. You might possibly with help of a counselor, a playlist of music called \u201cFirst Aid\u201d with music that makes you happy and possibly a set of pictures that make you happy as well.  (This is what I do)    I\u2019ll be praying for you and know there are those out there just like you and wish we could give you a hug then tell you to go do your best.   I guess a long distance hug will have to do. \ud83d\ude01 {{{HUGS}}}",

There\u2019s no problems when your gone. When no one\u2019s around. There\u2019s nothing needing fixing or attention. There\u2019s just that peaceful nothingness.",

    "postText": "Had some hard partying nights and browned out last night. Lectured a friend on how they should go to therapy but feel bad like I was attacking them rather than trying to help. Also experienced what was almost a big bar fight and while nothing bad happened keep having intrusive thoughts over how it could have gone worse.\n\nEveryone I was with talked to me today and no one thinks I was sloppy/annoying. \n\nI suffer from severe depression and anxiety so I\u2019m sure this is just a regular spike. Just feeling extremely down right now.",

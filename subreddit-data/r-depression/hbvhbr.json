Go hiking, scuba diving, bungee jumping.\n\nI might not be the best person to be giving advice because I struggle with the same thoughts you have as well. But I've decided that before I make an irreversible decision, I'm going to do wild, fun and (probably) reckless things.

The wishing to not wake up, to be in a car accident, to be shot at a bank robbery etc. While it still counts as suicidal behavior, it is on the lesser end.

That fear of death is your own mind telling you that you\u2019re not ready to give up, you have the courage to find confidence again. The courage to live! I know this because i\u2019m fighting that fight too. \n\nAsk yourself this tho: where might these feelings that i\u2019ve lost confidence come from? ..Insecurities? Fear of failure? Doubt? Past trauma? Shame? \n\nWhat do I do when I feel this way? How do I cope? \n\nUnderstanding where you lost your confidence is the key to finding it again. You are worthy of so much. You are capable of so much. I know this to be true because YOU are YOU, and YOU are the shit. Try and find a way to tell this to yourself so you never forget.    \n\nAlso, what\u2019s helped me is Teddy Roosevelts \u201cMan in the arena speech\u201d. Maybe it\u2019ll help you too!",

You can find happiness as well. Maybe the surroundings are problem. Try to change that. But never do something final until you've tried. Because eventually you will fit somewhere.

I don\u2019t want to be having a conversation with death at the end of my life (or God, whomever comes first) and realize that I spent most of my LIFE wanting to DIE. This is the only life we get as far as we know. Depression is such a bitch that robs you of the quality of your life, I hate it. I\u2019ve noticed that I think the least about my depression when I\u2019m trying something new. Doing something that I\u2019ve never done before. Depression keeps you from the energy or motivation you need to actually get up and do something new, but when I actually do it and I tell my inner thoughts to be quiet for one damn second, I am grateful and I find myself thanking myself later for it. I don\u2019t know who you are or what your situation is or where you depression stems from (mine is childhood trauma) but we are all energies in the great big universe. Your life is not meaningless, and you absolutely matter. You are here for now, so make your mark on the world.",

When I have been really depressed I\u2019ve fantasised about having symptoms of cancer and how I could just not tell anyone and then I would get to die guilt free and nobody would know that I was partly responsible. Now I feel a bit better I feel extremely guilty for this, especially as both my parents had aggressive cancer and a close family friend who I loved dearly suffered and died from it. But then, when you are depressed you are mentally ill and suicidal thoughts are a part of that. Please get the help you need and speak to someone you can trust about this though. I wish you all the best in your recovery please stay safe xxx",

I received a kidney transplant from my sister so would never act on it as that is the biggest \"fuck you\" to her sacrifice but that doesn't stop my mind from going wild.\n\n Same with others who posted it's the not caring about living and that all filters into not looking after yourself.\n\nBest piece of advice I've seen was to aim for being a better you than yesterday and starting small. I spent days in bed, not washing, not eating, no contact etc. This helped me take those initial steps. One day I got out of bed. The next I'm showering. I'm contacting friends again etc. Give yourself these small targets and they will grow into more!\n\nIt's not smooth sailing and some days are rough but good luck on your journey everyone!",

Hell, is slipping back into clinical depression which may be influenced by undue stressors, lack of sunlight, physical illness, etc.  I am not clinically depressed at present. I am glad to be alive. I can do things. I have caught up on all the housework I neglected in the months I was depressed. I am more attentive to my cats. So, I will enjoy my life, and maybe I will never become clinically depressed again, but I doubt this. I only take 300mg of lamictal daily and I am wary of adding any other meds. Lamictal is my base medication. Sometimes I can prevent a prolonged depression by taking 600-800mg of lamictal a day for two or three days. I call this jump starting my brain, and it does work provided my fogged depressed state brain let's me think to do this.  I also want to mention that my Roman Catholic faith is absolutely shattered during depression, along with everything else that is good in life. I am alone. I take care of myself and my three cats. When you are clinically depressed, there is nobody to take care of you, even if you did have the comfort of someone to take care of you.",

I have never attempted suicide in a realistic way, but have definitely roleplayed scenarios, sometimes using props.  I feel like it's a demon in all of us trying to destroy our lives.  I'm also a believer in Jesus Christ, and keep waiting for a signal of his love.  I feel like I get little hints of it, but not the fireworks show I guess I expect.  Prayer works, unfortunately the monotony of life, along with constant stress can eat you alive.  I haven't had a drink in almost 8 years, but feel like I'm close to relapsing.  Glad I'm not alone, and I hope all of you that read this can find the strength to carry on and find enjoyment in life.  I have kept myself busy and have accomplished things financially that I thought would end these thoughts, on the contrary they have magnified them. True happiness has come to me through charity to others, if that makes any sense...God bless you all.",

    "postText": "So I have had depression for forever, I have both inherited and trauma based treatment resistant flavour. I have been almost totally shut off for nearly 5 years now. I had a very abusive relationship (you know the kind.. where you have flashbacks and you wish someone would just support you but it doesn\u2019t happen) I have no clue how to move forward, I feel like I am annoying. I have come to expect rejection. If I ask for help I know that there is no point they are so busy.  Is it wrong to wish that I could erase my memories.",

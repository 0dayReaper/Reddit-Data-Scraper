    "postText": "I\u2019m so tired of trying to hold it together. I\u2019m tired of going to work everyday and not being able to afford to live. I hate being alone but I refuse to try and develop relationships. The weeks I don\u2019t have my kids the silence in my house is deafening. It\u2019s just me and my thoughts. I hate it inside my head. I\u2019m 33 and the thought of living past 50 sounds fucking terrible. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been truly happy. I don\u2019t know that I know how to be happy.",

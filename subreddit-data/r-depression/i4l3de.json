I want to be happy and suicide is apparently the only way I will get out of the negative and at least into neutral so... \u2018happier\u2019 technically.\n\nBut part of me knows that happy still exists somewhere. Something bullshit good happens somewhere along the line and that gets absorbed by the \u2018don\u2019t do it\u2019 camp and it keeps me afloat for a bit longer.\n\nSo I\u2019m still afloat now, and a lot more buoyant than before i found a therapist / therapy that works for me, but I\u2019m starting to slip because I\u2019m just so bored and null and having bad days again. \n\nWhat\u2019s done it for me to actually force myself into working the shitty job of self-care was a small skit from Ricky Gervais\u2019 \u2018Afterlife\u2019 in which they interview a very dishevelled man who posts all his letters in a dog poo bin (the funny part). The educational part is when this middle-older aged man has never had a relationship because every woman will just leave him (i.e. everything in life eventually ends/dies. - as depression kindly keeps reminding me). Because of this he never cares for his personal hygiene, nor his health. And now he can barely see, barely walk, barely hold his bladder and really is just... pretty much an avatar for peak depression. But he\u2019s still alive? He\u2019s sad, sure, but not suicidal like the main character and it just made me think.\n\nIf you\u2019re going to wake up and drink your coffee each morning (i.e. not kill yourself that day) then you might as well just DO. Otherwise, you really do end up absolutely miserable and continuing to exist in a state of nothingness and each day you don\u2019t DO, is a step further into living as a nothing. That being said, the dishevelled man did find great pleasure in having a piss moments after the interview ended, so even as this husk of a man, he still had pleasure in life..... just not pleasures that will get him the things he wants.\n\nNot sure what my point is here, i don\u2019t think one can \u2018make a point\u2019 about how to \u2018fix\u2019 depression. You just sit and think (or meditate) and hope that one day you\u2019re going to make a connection between a thought and a positive/constructive emotion instead of the other way around. Drugs and therapy HELPS you do this, but they don\u2019t DO it. A lot of people struggle there too, I certainly did.\n\nSo i guess to make a point... just, observe the world around you. Try and see how doing \u2018stupid\u2019 things you hate and have no point work for other people or other things (a dog is just as happy chasing after a tennis ball as it is getting love and affection - why? How does it do that?!) \n\nAnyway. I hope things get better and I hope you can find strength to make today day 1 of doing. It\u2019s so, so hard to stop yourself from drowning and nobody expects you to. But keep trying every day and Quesadilla Quesadilla (yes, this is incorrect - but it\u2019s dumb and it makes my thoughts do a little tiny dumb bit of happy watching/hearing people figure it out)",

My brain is damaged, dozens of antidepressants, 18 sessions of electro-shock therapy last yr as a last resort. comorbid with many other ailments, every second is pain. It's very hard to get by the day minute to minute, second to second. my mind is constantly occupied with (sometimes) traumatizing racing thoughts, about the past, present, and future.\n\nI just turned 30, and have been dreading it for years, my entire 20s were basically lost to depression. I am only staying alive (which is very hard, relying on several chemical dependencies i've developed while the manifestation of my symptoms got worse.)\n\nI will try to make a post with more details but it is impossible to explain my situation. I am living for others, because I have empathy, (given if I were to die for some reason, my family would go through hell)  Would suicide make me selfish in this case? I feel the opposite. there isnt enough context, but they are forcing me to live for them to some extent, I've experienced emotional blackmail, and its ruined me. I want to get better, I want to live a good life, etc, but I dont see that happening, to start I dont even have the money to look into treatment/centers for people like me. I barely have the cognitive abilities to do research anymore. I think some of my only options at getting better might involve, ibogaine treatment, ayahuasca, microdosing psilocybin etc ?\n\nI am not going to make it through this month. I've always said if I turn 30 and still am spiraling downwards, suffering in misery and pain constantly, I cannot logically see any reason to continue living, just extremely empathetic towards my family and don't want them dealing with that, but I would be in a  better place. (My dad btw is the abuser who created all of this and continues to use his sociopathic tactics to thrive off of the people around him, while draining them.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI dont know what to do, i rarely have energy or motivation to make a comment anymore, I wish things could get better, but they are not, they are getting worse, rapidly. If I had the ability to save myself, I would save my siblings and mother next, they are all also mentally ill from this crazy upbringing/hierarchy that has been going on since my parents met, in Tokyo in the late 80s I guess. Since I was born 1990. Just had my 'golden birthday'. as well, I layed in my room in my sweat, suffering, starving, unable to get out of bed, as usual.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI cant keep going like this.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIs there help out there for people like me? Im extremely sorry if I hijacked anyones thread, I havent used reddit in ages",

    "postText": "I can\u2019t go to a hospital because I need to work over the summer and I\u2019m in school during the year so I can\u2019t waste any time. I\u2019m autistic and most therapist doubt my diagnosis and don\u2019t help me through my symptoms (which are among my biggest issues). It\u2019s difficult to find any therapist, never mind a good one who actually understands autism and me as a person. I can\u2019t find a good psychiatrist either. My depression has gotten so bad to the point where all I wanna do is sleep and cry. I don\u2019t even wanna be alive. But I have no idea why it\u2019s gotten so bad all of a sudden. I\u2019m afraid something is seriously wrong with my mind or body, but no clinicians are able to help. It\u2019s hard enough getting an appointment, but when I do get one, doctors act like they\u2019re in a rush and never thoroughly take the time to understand my issues. They just push medicine on me whatever chance they get. I might have a brain tumor and they\u2019d never know. Maybe whatever it is will kill me and then there would be no problem.",

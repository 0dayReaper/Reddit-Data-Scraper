All morning all I can think about is how badly I want to die.  I\u2019m ugly, stupid and unworthy of love at all.  I\u2019m sorry to vent, but I don\u2019t want to vent to people in my life who don\u2019t need to hear my stupid shit.  It never gets better and I don\u2019t think it ever will.  I hope I die soon.",

Yet, you still matter. Your presence still has an impact on the world. Small ripples are enough, it doesn't have to be sweeping waves of change.",

The truth is I'm young, still considered a child and apparently these thoughts aren't supposed to be happening to me. Anytime I try to mention it my oldest sibling just calls me an attention seeker and that I should do it already, is she right? Should I just end it now?",

Unfortunately, opening yourself up to people you thought you could trust only to be told something terrible like that is all too common. No, you shouldn't end your life. That said, do not feel any shame for feeling that way in case you are feeling suicidal! I was blessed with two amazing older sisters myself. I can't fathom telling your own sibling something like that under any circumstance. You posted that these thoughts shouldn't be happening to someone your age. Unfortunately, bad thoughts can plague anyone at any age. I was diagnosed by a therapist as clinically depressed when I was 8 years old and first felt suicidal when I was about 10. Do you have any hobbies or interests? Maybe you'll feel better if you focus on doing the things you enjoy. I know that may sound a little obvious but I feel that when I get depressed I tend to ignore the things I like, almost as if I forgot about them. I hope you feel better asap! Reddit is always a place you can turn to, never forget that!",

    "postText": "I can tell that he *cares* but he doesn\u2019t really *understand* my depression. Any time I reach out and am honest with my feelings he\u2019s always like \u201cyou shouldn\u2019t talk like that\u201d and the whole \u201clife gets better\u201d shpeal. Then eventually he just stops responding until the next morning hoping that I feel better by then.\n\nHe\u2019s a great guy but part of me feels like I\u2019m dragging him down/can\u2019t reach out when I\u2019m depressed. He\u2019s lucky enough to have at least a stable mom so ofc he\u2019s not gonna hate his life the way I do. I can\u2019t sit here and pretend that I\u2019m all smiles all the time.\n\nIdk if I should break up with him before he gets the chance to break up with me first.",

Talk to him\nand explain how you feel in the best way you can. try not to give up on him yet, just because he doesn\u2019t understand does not mean he will leave you or that you guys cant work this out. I hope you feel better overall.",

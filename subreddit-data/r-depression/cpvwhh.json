But I\u2019m also sick of constantly feeling like I\u2019m about to break. I hate nearly downing my pills each night only to wake up the next day to plaster a fake as smile on my face and go to work. Each night I think to myself I can\u2019t go on like this and each day I do. Part of me just somehow wishes I completely gave up and just hit rock bottom. I don\u2019t know. Anyone else feel the same?",

My motivation to do anything is rarely positive, it's almost all borne from anxiety. Or being chewed out by my mother I guess, who thinks she's compassionate towards mental illness but quite clearly isn't when it's not someone saying they want to kill themselves or having a full-blown panic attack. I think that's one thing those that are saying we should be grateful we're not low-functioning miss\u2014even if people weren't sympathetic, they can at least see there's something *wrong* with you. But if you're high-functioning people think you're fine when you know you're not and it just feels so hopeless. Reaching out seems pointless, because who except you (worthless) is it really going to help?\n\nI wonder if it's the anxiety + depression combination responsible for this kind of dysfunctional functioning. It's an ongoing issue with me, because I feel like I wouldn't get anything done if it weren't for the \"list of things I have to, should be doing, oh my god there's so many things why didn't you start this sooner also everything has to be perfect or you're garbage\" kind of thinking. I could just stay in bed, feeling bad but not in any motivated way. The dysfunctional functioning doesn't feel sustainable but I can't figure out a way to stop. It's like at some point I had to choose between fully feeling things and appearing normal and chose the latter without even realising because I couldn't ever process the idea of doing anything else.",

I'm not saying the result was good, but letting go of the daily grind of \"pushing through\" did come as a relief.",

Being stuck in these emotional and cognitive states is plenty awful enough without also having to hide it and perform as if everything was ok.\n\nAdd to that the fact that people with high-functioning depression tend to be at much more risk, partly because there is no release valve, but also because it is so much harder to get support when so much of the world interprets \"functioning\" as \"doing ok\" and \"high functioning\" as \"doing great\".\n\nI wish I had some useful things to suggest, but from my perspective, suggestions for ways to develop psychological safety valves, or even to learn ways to challenge harmful beliefs, would do more harm than good and cause more pain if made in this context - that sort of conversation necessitates knowing a person well, and being able to monitor how they are doing, rather than blurting out things on an anonymised forum. I realise that may seem cowardly, but it is more to do with not wanting to ride roughshod over your situations. So, because I can't do that, in the most loving way possible, I wish all of you a good breakdown, and the means to obtain the care and self-care that you all need.",

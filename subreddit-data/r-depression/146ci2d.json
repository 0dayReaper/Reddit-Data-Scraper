    "postText": "I\u2019ve been on high doses of Haloperidol, Clozapine and Abilify for 3 years after a breakup psychosis in the beginning of 2020 that sent me to a ward first time in my life. They killed my metabolism and I started gaining weight like never before. I don\u2019t experience psychosis anymore but depression is unbearable while taking these meds. I can\u2019t feel anything and my anxiety is over the roof. I am in a real hell and completely dead inside. My psychiatrist tells I will have to take these pills forever and always warns me that if I quit they will lock me up again. I am so drained that I want to call quits on life. I am in a loop. Nobody hears my voice. I want to be normal guy I once was\u2026",

If they\u2019re threatening to put you on lock down because you want to change meds due to side effects that are negatively impacting your life and livelihood then OP needs to find another care provider who will listen to them.",

There are many others. It\u2019s time for a detailed discussion about managing your symptoms but also helping you with your goals and improving your quality of life.",

I gained a lot of weight on them and was a total zombie, couldn\u2019t even read and remember page in a book. I echo what others have said, please find an other psychiatrist who will be willing to work with you and help you to switch to meds with lesser side effects.",

They don't do the ground work (therapy), they want you straight away to take meds and have you come for a check up of your symptoms, nothing more. They're assholes craving for money.\n\nIf your condition isn't as bad as having schizophrenia or dissociative personality disorder I wouldn't suggest psychiatrists.\n\nIf you're sad they don't look for what's making you sad they want you to take antidepressants. They suck ass.\nA good open-minded therapists is  a better idea.",

If you have only had 1 psychotic episode then I really would get another opinion from a different psychiatrist if at all possible. Clozapine in particular has a lot of side effects and is usually reserved for people who failed other treatments. Your doctor should be mindful of your concerns, not just blow you off or threaten you.",

She also says she have to take them all her life and if she don't take them, the doctors and her father threatning her about locking up her too, again.

    "postText": "Anhedonia/Apathy [space]\nI've been dealing with intense feelings of hopelesneess and a lack of motivation. I can't function properly, nor take care of myself to the extent I should.\nI've given up on easy fixes, because I know I probably have chronic depression, and my unsociable nature fucks with every bit of progress I make. My question is, how can I temporarily get the boost I need to talk about it with someone? I have severe anxiety and I've had trouble with people whom I've expressed my feelings to in the past, so it's always been a dodgy subject for me. I just want to feel motivated enough to be able to risk talking with my mom about it, and maybe get a psychiatrist if necessary.\nIf it's just a thing of willpower, then I might as well give up on it. It's not often I ask for help but please give tips if you have any.",

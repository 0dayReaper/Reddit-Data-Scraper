    "postText": "I just need to talk and get it out. I\u2019ve been drinking almost every night since I turned 19, about two months ago. It\u2019s the only thing that takes away the feeling of my OCD running through my brain all the time, and it has been helping ease everything. I recently started talking to a guy that I met on a dating app, and he\u2019s someone that I\u2019ve actually wanted something real with in about a year. After a week of talking we made plans to go on a date the following Saturday. \nOn Thursday, I was hit with the news that my Grandfather has cancer. I\u2019ve been staying with my Grandmother nightly, which is causing me to miss my zoloft some days which has been a whirl mixed with the fact that I am about to start my period, so I\u2019ve been very emotionally stressed.\nI went on the date with the guy, it seemed to have went really well but they days leading up, and the following days I immediately got a negative gut feeling that he wasn\u2019t into me. Every time I\u2019ve gotten this gut feeling, it has turned out right. \nIt went on like this during the week and was turning me into a nervous wreck, and causing me to be a little rocky with him but I did my best to push through. I finally mentioned that he seemed more quiet and he said that everything was good between us.\nToday I asked him on another date and he told me he just wants to be friends. I liked him a lot and it really hurt my feelings, but I thanked him for letting me know and told him that I enjoyed talking with him.\nOn top of this, my best friend got a girlfriend two days ago and she\u2019s spent the weekend with her, so tonight when I called her crying she was already a little busy and ended up dropping off when I texted her.\nI\u2019m just struggling a lot right now with everything and I want to feel better, I want to feel cared about and like I have a grip on my life. I haven\u2019t had much luck at all with dating, I\u2019ve never been in a serious relationship before.\nTension has been real with my family not only because of my Grandpa, but more family stuff that has come out, and it just feels like everything is going on right now.\nWhat can I do to feel better?",

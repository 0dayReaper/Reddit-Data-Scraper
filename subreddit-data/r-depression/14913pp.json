    "postText": "As the weathers been hotter i\u2019ve been really enjoying myself, getting a tan, working on myself, just generally feeling good. My brother just got home from uni a few days ago, and as of the last week i have been feeling complete rock bottom again, irritable, tired, just in a bad mood, constantly on the verge of tears. He\u2019s not being particularly annoying other than badly expressing his own problems, we\u2019ve had a bad relationship in the past when we were younger fairly emotionally damaging so i\u2019m wondering if purely his presence of being back home is just a huge trigger without me realising, or maybe i\u2019m just having one of those weeks. Anyone know anything on this?",

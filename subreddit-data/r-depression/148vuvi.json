    "postText": "Hi everyone,\n\nI know there\u2019s a lot of sympathizing/empathizing on this subreddit as well as the desire to find other in the same situation, but I\u2019m looking if anyone has found recovery after lifelong depression.\n\nI\u2019ve had depression since I was a child, I\u2019m 23 now, and I\u2019m just beginning to get treatment. My cognition is shot. My memory is pretty much nonexistent beyond simple survival necessities and I can\u2019t think or do much. I\u2019m wondering if anyone in their treatment journey was able to get their cognitive abilities back online and normalized after years or decades of depression.\n\nI\u2019m really curious as I really want to get better and if anyone who\u2019s reading this who has indeed been restored I beg that you respond. I really need to know that it\u2019s possible. \n\nTLDR: has anyone after decades of depression and cognitive atrophy been able to recover and normalize?\n\nThanks everyone. I pray all have you a bright and happy future.",

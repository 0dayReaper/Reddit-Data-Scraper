I've seen those places and they are truly awful for the most part as far as I can tell. I would tell them what you've said here! Say that you are okay now and explain that what you've said was different than what was told by others. Convince them that you aren't a threat to yourself or anyone else (as long as that's the case here of course which I believe it is). At the same time, you can feel free to be honest about what's on your mind. Explain to them what you posted here about wanting a therapist to talk to. I hope everything works out!",

They listened very well to my ex all three times and the one time I went for myself as well and they never made any notion of forcing either of us to be admitted. Remember to stay calm and you'll get through it! Everything will be okay!",

From your post I assume some sort of rumor was formed (or something like that at least) and it turned into something much different than the truth. There's a good chance the doctor sent to talk to you is a reasonable, decent person. I think this of course because after all, sending a doctor that's a complete ass to talk to people who are experiencing mental/emotional anguish is just about one of the worst ideas imaginable. Out of the four total doctors I've spoken with between my ex and I, all four were great people who genuinely cared.",

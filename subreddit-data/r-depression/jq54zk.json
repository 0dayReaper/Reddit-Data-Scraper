People will go on and on and on about how we should all reach out to mentally ill people then when you have the courage to reach out to them the same fucking people will tell you bullshit like \"man up\", \"stop being so sensitive\", \"hey bro at least you're not a starving child in Africa\", \"bro it's just your mindset you gotta start thinking more positively\", and so on. Like what's the fucking point. Whenever we do reach out we either get scolded or our problems get dismissed. I'm not trying to say this is how it is for everyone but this is just from my experiences. \n\nI just want someone to fucking listen just once and for once I want to be able to tell someone about this without fear of eventually getting ghosted. Is that asking for too much?",

One issue is that we\u2019re both recovering drug addicts so if one relapses the other does too. Obviously there are also just the issues with there having been deaths around both of us and the other person\u2019s deaths are too hard for the other to take (not corona, surprisingly). But it\u2019s the drug addiction that\u2019s the really big problem and it kind of goes hand in hand with any other type of negative emotion. In that sense we feed into the extreme negative parts. Apparently she\u2019s also been a bit uncomfortable with the way I express emotions too but hasn\u2019t said anything (like showing physical affection, she grew up with absolutely none at all or worse and I show lots of physical affection to everybody). So I feel that there is wiggle room for me to be able to feel she still cares for me, that there isn\u2019t just an easy answer. We need to work on ourselves separately but still discuss any and all happy news, make sure we don\u2019t lose each other. Life is complicated.",

She\u2019s fucked up her life so many times I\u2019ve lost count &amp; she always ends up staying with us yet she\u2019s almost 30 years old &amp; is **still** talking to her ex, so she\u2019s already pre-fucked up her life again. With 3 kids, it\u2019s really inexcusable why she\u2019s not gotten her life straight yet. She\u2019s being selfish af &amp; ruining their lives too all bc she thinks her ex is gonna change on the 10th try. I really don\u2019t understand why the rest my family keeps helping her, especially when it\u2019s causing problems for everyone, plus she has a pain pill addiction so when she\u2019s going thru withdrawals, she acts 3x as bitchy as she usually does.",

I was already dealing with depression &amp; anxiety when I was laid off from work in March, due to covid19. Up until August, my department manager reassured me that my job \"was waiting for me\" &amp; as soon as business picked back up, they would get me back to work ASAP. I work in retail &amp; had been there for 4 years. I talked to her on a Sunday &amp; once again, she told me to not worry &amp; AGAIN reassured me that they were going to get me back to work ASAP. The very NEXT DAY, the store manager called &amp; told me they were letting me go. I was full-time, had benefits, made decent money , &amp; at the time, I enjoyed my job. I was devastated. On top of my emotional problems, now I have to find a new job. My husband is only working part-time since his hours were cut , I still haven't found a job, we lost our car, we are in danger of being evicted, ALL of our utilities are behind, &amp; my anxiety is worse than it's EVER been in my life. I have NEVER been in such a dire financial situation. My unemployment runs out THIS WEEK &amp; we literally have $0.48 to our names. But you know what ? I NEEDED to get away from the toxic work environment I was in. I had no real friends there. The \"friends\" @ work who \"loved\" me ? I haven't heard from ONE - since March. I am SO pissed off that management lied to me &amp; I NEED my job...but not THAT job. I did a GREAT job &amp; don't understand why I was treated the way I was treated. I am DESPERATE for a job, but I'm SO glad that I don't have to be around a bunch of fake, hypocritical, conniving, lying, &amp; rotten people. Reading your reply helped me to see the light &amp; I am truly thankful. Maybe now I can get over just being SO angry, accept that I lost my job, &amp; let it go. I've applied @ a few places that are within walking distance from home, but other than that, I'm so depressed that sometimes I pray that I won't wake up. I have a panic attack when I have to leave home for ANYTHING. My anxiety is so bad right now, I can feel my eyeballs shaking. But I never have to see those a$$hats that I used to work with again...&amp; that is a comfort. I'm so sorry this is so long!!!",

At least when it comes to our close friends and family. People we reach out to aren't mind-readers. They are not competent mental health professionals. They too are imperfect humans going through their own struggles. \n\nWouldn't it help if we cut them some slack and just let them know exactly how we need to be supported? I am sure more people than we think would be willing to support us in the way that you have so beautifully shared here. But people can't give you something they don't know you need. \n\nIn absence of that knowledge, they can only offer the best approximation of what they think might help in a given situation, and sometimes, it is those catchphrases.",

Never tell them that someone\u2019s going through something worse or tell them to look at the so called \u2018bright side\u2019 because that\u2019s disrespectful and dismissive to the suffering that they\u2019re going through. Never talk over them, because when you\u2019re going through something you wouldn\u2019t want someone to be like \u2018Oh yeah I had someone die too\u2019, they don\u2019t want that... and they don\u2019t want advice. They want to feel cared for. They want how they\u2019re feeling to truly matter to you. You know when ur mad at someone ? (I\u2019m just using this as an example to demonstrate the concept of validation) You don\u2019t want someone to tell you not to be mad at whoever upset you. Often you\u2019d want them to be like, \u2018yeah that person is horrible! I can\u2019t believe they did that to you !\u2019 I\u2019d be upset if someone did that to me, too.\u2019 And a lot of the time people just want their voice to be heard, they need to vent to you and know you understand them. So always let them talk as much as they feel. That\u2019s how you show them you support them and that you\u2019re there, and that you understand how pain works: how their pain works.",

I encouraged you and said I'm here for you - that should be enough. well, I'm not your therapist and I'm not equipped to fix you.\"\n\nnot that I had ever asked to be \"fixed\" by a friend. I was just looking for some acceptance.\n\nI think there's a lot of value in just giving a person the space to feel down, unhappy, drained, stressed or otherwise not cheerful/upbeat without pressuring them to put on happy face or trying to \"fix\" them.\n\nI know it's unpleasant to be around someone who's depressed or struggling. but I also know what it would mean to me to have someone who was willing to spend a little time with me even when I'm not \"fun\" and can't put on the happy face.",

            "comment": "I'll play devil's advocate and say someone supporting mental health treatment doesn't necessarily have to commit to a lifetime of lending an ear to struggling people if they don't want to. Supporting therapy, medicine, research, government and societal support in forwarding these efforts, doesn't mean the person as an individual has to want to play therapist to someone who approaches them. Quite the opposite, if they're acknowledging that mental illness is a real thing and an undesirable state for someone to be in, that person would support you in going to get help more than they want to be locked into a conversation with you if they accept that you are an unwell person. Depressed people are constantly on this sub wanting to tell the rest of the world how to change but one thing depressed people need to accept about themselves is the over-thinking and over-talking and obsessive patterns they have, and one more person who sits and talks with you probably isn't going to do anything for you.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm more on your side than you will think after me saying that. I wish everyone would be a wonderful friend to you who would sit and listen rather than throw catchphrases at you. But wishing for other people to change is one of the least fruitful things you can do with your time on this planet. You can either take that type of behavior as a sign that the person is not actually a good friend to you, or that your desires for help and support need to be aimed in a different direction, or any number of other conclusions. But the least likely thing to happen is that you'll ever get what you want from people who aren't offering it, or change society or anything else. \n\nI always try to encourage depressed people to let friendships and the social contacts that you have be one avenue of life where you can escape your depression for a while, rather than use them as another tool for delving into the same depression topics that you are already doing every other hour of the day. Talk to a friend about something fun or suggest something to do together. Yes you should be able to vent to friends and receive some support in a perfect world. But maybe your friend sees more than you do that another hour talking about whatever is wrong isn't going to do anything better for you.",

I say this as someone who suffered from anxiety and depression for 3 years - even on the worst days, taking 100% accountability for our state of mind and doing one positive thing to improve does help a lot more than finding another person to blame and play the victim. And these catchphrases that people who suffer from depression hate - come on y'all stop for a second... sometimes all or at least some of them are true! Speaking from experience:\n\n\\- sometimes the truth was that I was indeed stuck in a cycle of overthinking. What I needed to do was just get out of my head, start cleaning my room and go for a run and engage with the real world. So when someone is telling you to not overthink, or get out of your head - there could be truth to that!!!\n\n\\- sometimes, knowing that others have it worse did help me. I could cultivate gratitude for my current state. I did a thought exercise where I imagined I could be depressed AND paralyzed right now. My therapist put forth this perspective and it helped. I realized I would much rather be just depressed than be depressed AND paralyzed and that acceptance literally lifted me out of the depths of depression by about 50%\n\n\\- sometimes, the answer is eating better, quitting alcohol, sleeping at a regular time, and maintaining a routine\n\n\\- sometimes, we do need to hold a more positive mindset and not let go of hope. I mean depression is a negative state of being ... only positive can overcome negative. Like only heat can counter cold. I do not understand why people get so up in arms and defensive when they are told to cultivate a more positive mindset. It has been proven scientifically to help.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nConstantly being stuck in victim mode and throwing ourselves a pity party every opportunity we get is not going to help anyone. I say this as someone who did all of these things before I realized how idiotic I was being how unhelpful this compulsive behaviorwas. These habits were literally perpetuating the cycle and keeping me stuck and depressed.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo folks, hold on to that hope, go out for a run and do it every day (for months) like your life depends on it, let those endorphins work their magic, do think positive thoughts, and nurture your body like you would a newborn or your favorite pet. It does get better but we need to take more personal responsibility and stop wasting our time demonizing the world for not understanding us. \n\nWhy even expect that the world understands us. How does it matter? The only thing that matters is that we dig ourselves out of the depressed state. \n\nEdit: Also, the people you reach out to aren't necessarily equipped with cutting edge knowledge of how to deal with someone suffering from mental health issues. They too are just human trying to do what they think might help in a given situation. So if someone tells you, hey you need to be more positive or others have it worse or drink more water or fix your nutrition... it is not an attack on your state of mind. It isn't in any way meant to minimize your struggle. They are just sharing what they think might help. And it is basic human nature to help when someone seems like they are in trouble. I don't understand why people on this sub get so upset when someone is simply trying to give them helpful advice from their perspective. We have to remember, the friends, family, colleagues, etc. we reach out to for support are not mind readers. They have not done a Ph.D. in our current pathology. They do not know what we really really want or need. Truth is, most times, even we don't know what we really want. So, as in the case of OP, a simple request stating that \"I just need to feel heard right now. So please don't give me any advice or try to fix me, just listen to me, let me vent.\" That is it. That person now knows what to do.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease stop expecting everyone to be mental health professionals who know exactly what you need. Depression distorts reality and makes everything seem much more negative than it is. Please be mindful of this the next time you go out to demonize random people in your circle for simply trying to help imperfectly.",

I had to learn this the hard way but expecting others to be there for you through something that they are not equipped to handle and deal with will only end up hurting the both of you. It is okay to ask for some help from time to time but expecting someone to be there all the time is detrimental to not only the other person but you as well. I am now in extensive therapy and working on it and I\u2019m hoping that I can mend my relationship that I am currently in a break on now. I am hoping to show him my ability to change and not call him during my panic or manic episodes and my ability to be independent but I\u2019m scared that he won\u2019t give me a shot. Hoping other people realize how unhealthy this behavior is before they end up ruining the best thing that came into their lives like I did.",

I am the typical person who will fake it in real life and even in DMs that they are fine, it\u2019s really hard for me to open and when I do ( like the last time) I got have you ever performed CPR on your family member? have you ever experienced what it\u2019s like to have an alcoholic parent? : I never speak about my traumas what participated for me to be like this, why do they assume I have never experienced terrible things? Plus what does it matter in the end who suffered more? I can\u2019t control my brain, I am glad you didn\u2019t suffer from your inner demons they way I do.\nIt\u2019s interesting how they are more understanding when it comes to other illnesses like my good example:\n\nIf somebody smokes they might end up having lung cancer: most of the lung cancer patients smoked but NOT EVERYBODY: some of them never smoked yet developed lung cancer : if we say traumas=smoking as we name them environmental factors should we judge or accuse non-smoker lung cancer patients : you didn\u2019t even smoke how dare you have lung cancer? There are other people in the world facing asbestos and 3 packs of cigarettes a day: you see how awful it is in this case to behave like  that, then why do they behave like that in mental health issues? \nOr asking a Diabetes patient: how dare you have high blood glucose level? You didn\u2019t even eat the same amount of food like us? \n\nIt\u2019s just creating in an already damaged person. Mental illness builds up on a lot of factors. Genetical predisposition+ environmental factors at the right time, in good proportions. \n\nIt\u2019s like the same with serial killers: you see like Ed Gein, Aileen Wournos, Jeffrey Dahmer ( I picked the ones where there were siblings and they got the same treatment basically because in Edmund Kemper\u2019s case his sisters were treated well) : so why is that these people\u2019s siblings never become serial killers? Though they were brought up together plus they even have genetical connection.\n\nExtreme examples need to be mentioned but they don\u2019t want to understand because everybody just starts from their on situation, own traumas and how they have a different life inside their head than you do.\n\nAnd I hate that the last time I snapped and everybody thought I am suicidal I was though but not brave enough. They wanted to call the ambulance on me, many people texted how I could talk to them. But it\u2019s just being polite. The ambulance won\u2019t save me. It will save me for like days, weeks, months but it won\u2019t save me. \nAll the people who said I could talk to disappeared or even blamed me how God won\u2019t forgive it if I commit suicide. How I should seek therapy: I have been to 5 psychiatrist, and 4 therapist and basically on 6 drugs since the age of 15. I am 25. And as I have mentioned I am really a shy person, the doctors and therapist see how I am smiling because I smile all the time the only way I can express my feelings are through forums like this.",

Well, yeah, and I know I have seen worse times. So don't give up hope. We can all work on this slowly and steadily.\n\nI think they also need help with how to deal with it. If you don't have experience with it you might feel overwhelmed, anxious and insecure. And some things can be really demanding, too. So there is just something to learn. \u2665\ufe0f Take care\n\n**Edit:** When you reach out to someone and you know they are inexperienced or you fear they might be insensitive, I would like to give you two tips at hand. Ask them if they feel ready for this. Tell them that you are really down and don't want tough love under any circumstances, but serious love and support. \nIf they don't feel ready for it, you both better refrain from. This can be a mood of the day or a general inability to deal with this. Talk about it. \n\nSecondly, if you meet someone, who is willing to help you and you once again fear, how they might hurt you  further, assure them, that you will help them to help you. If they do something that doesn't feel good, you will gently tell them and you will be open and honest about the kind of support that you really just need in this moment. \n\nA good, kind-hearted person will agree on this and be happy to not solely rely on their own inexperienced ass when helping you.",

I even supported his girlfriend in a very critical life or death situation and they both really appreciated me for it and I introduced 2 of my other friends to them, from the same fandom too.\n\nOne day out of nowhere they just both decide to block me and one of my friends with the reason being that I was being \"negative\" apparently and that I was the annoying \"toxic\" friend to them and they never want to talk to me ever again. This hurt me so much to wake up to that and it only substantially worsened my mental health and confidence for a few months at least because it was in such a bad time trying to deal with my family's toxicity abuse and stigma around mental health, especially in Eastern Europe where I live in, mental healthcare is truly horrible most of the time here.\n\nI've gotten much better again since then but I'm still mad over that even after 1,5 years, considering I didn't really do anything wrong and they even did enjoy me a lot in their company. \n\nOn the other hands, I've once \"turned down\" a best IRL friend that was extremely supportive of me and always tried to help cheer me up and prevented a suicide attempt, much better than my family has ever \"cared\". That still hurts after 4,5 years even though it somewhat wasn't my fault maybe while having the worst time ever but at least we've became good friends again but she is studying at uni and working nowadays so she can't always be there to help me but she still listens and tries whenever she can.",

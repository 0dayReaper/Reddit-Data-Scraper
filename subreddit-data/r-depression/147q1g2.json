Not that I'm doing great, I'd just be doing worse without their support.\n\nIf you feel like you have someone close enough to you to get them involved in your struggles, do so. You're going to be pleasantly surprised with how much energy even just telling them can give you, not to mention the energy you could get from their support.",

I found out for myself that talking about it works, atleast if they are actually listening, otherwise i would stop about it before it started hurting that they didnt want to listen. So only talk to the ones you know are actually listening.",

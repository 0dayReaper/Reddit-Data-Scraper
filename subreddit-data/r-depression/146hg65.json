    "postText": "I\u2019m 34 years old and I don\u2019t find any joy in most things. I used to love playing video games and watching movies. Now I find myself frustrated at every new game, and I lose enjoyment watching any movie after around 10 minutes. I find myself just zombie scrolling through social media. I\u2019ve been trying to find a hobby but I just don\u2019t seem to have a passion for anything. I thought it was depression but my psych suggested that maybe I\u2019m just aging and my interests are changing\u2026",

I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s depression or if it\u2019s because my interests are changing, but it\u2019s hard to determine because I struggle to find any interests. Not sure what you mean by considering options\u2026",

It\u2019s the death of creativity and motivation. \nI used to love reading but find it difficult to focus on reading for more than 5 minutes. I started taking long breaks from my phone and pushing through a book instead and it started to switch back. Sometimes I\u2019d have to read a page 5 times before my attention could focus, which is something I never had an issue with before. \n\nMaybe try taking a break from your phone and living in the uncomfortableness of boredom? It might spark something in you again. Don\u2019t give up if it doesn\u2019t work right away as well. Try it consistently for a couple of weeks and see if you notice a benefit. It definitely helped me a lot! I hope the same for you.",

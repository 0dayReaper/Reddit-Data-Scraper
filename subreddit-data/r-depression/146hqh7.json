    "postText": "I\u2019ve had a lot of episodes this year. Like, maybe I\u2019m in just one 4-month episode with days off here and there. It\u2019s awful - like, I don\u2019t want to be alive if this is what living feels like. \n\nThe ketamine (2.5 years almost) is helpful, overall. I wonder if it\u2019s made it harder to have an episode. As in, the lows now feel like a real dive downward because I haven\u2019t felt as low ALL the time thanks to the medicine. \n\nI had this big sob a few weeks ago and it maybe was a turning point. I cried hard for nearly an hour about how much agony I\u2019ve felt for 32 years and how much it\u2019s defined and fucked up my life. I had hoped it was pent up grief that I\u2019d let go but every time my insomnia kicks in the next day is depressive torture. And it\u2019s almost always a problem, my insomnia. I have a new sleep doctor appointment but not for a month or more. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s going to be more medicines. More SSRIs that were awful for all their side effects. I tried 6 of them and they all made me ill. I\u2019m afraid of weight gain, nausea, IBS, anxiety. I had it all and ended up off medicine because it was just as miserable. \n\nI\u2019m so fucking tired of feeling awful. This subreddit and my mental health support group are the only places I can say it. Everyone else incl my spouse are too upset by how miserable I am to listen. I had a new friend I was getting close to once introduce me as the saddest person he knows. That hurt so badly I have dreams about it 18 months later still. It still hurts. It\u2019s prob true. \n\nI always wanted to be rid of it. I thought when I started treatment 17 years ago I\u2019d find a way to beat it. But I never will. It will never go away. Endless therapy. A dozen of different medications. Mushrooms, ayahuasca. Nothing can shake it. I will never feel calm or joy or happiness more than I feel misery and self hatred. \n\nI hate myself. I have fundamental beliefs in my mind that I\u2019m a piece of shit. That I\u2019m a net loss in any situation. That the only people who love or like me just don\u2019t know me very well, including my spouse. Maybe that\u2019s ridiculous. But that belief is inside me. I believe it. I don\u2019t want to. But I can\u2019t make it go away. I can\u2019t move its foundations. It may as well be in my DNA. \n\nSomeone once told me a writer described it as a big black dog that always followed her. And one day the dog wasn\u2019t there. I had such hope that might happen to me. And I know now the dog will always be there. It will reappear. And I\u2019m too tired and too experienced at it to forget about it when it goes away temporarily. \n\nI do not like life. Being alive. Living.",

    "postText": "I recently just got my first job for the summer. I am a cook for a small restaurant, not a fancy one but a side place that people go to. I have taken up drawing and people say that I am getting good at it. I have been doing some independent studying for my two degrees and I am finally starting to see a little bit of gym results. \n\nBut it never feels enough, I am also going to therapy and so on but life itself is still a drag. There doesn't seem to be a real reason why I am doing any of this stuff, only for the hope that eventually something will come from it. I take meds but I am in despair, I feel lonely without a girlfriend, friends, and a community I can connect with. \n\nBleh",

Depression is a cold, cruel, and lonely illness. It covers your eyes to a lot of brightness in our lives, and it reroutes our self confidence into the ground slowly until there\u2019s nothing left. \nI am sorry you do not have any company you can confide in. At one point, I felt so alone and that I had no one on my side. It wasn\u2019t until I realized, after being briefly away from the dark crutches of self loathing and depression, i had seen all the messages my friends and family had left me. The thought occurred to me, that depression have blindsided me to forget the people that cared for me. There\u2019s someone out there waiting to hear your story. If not now, they\u2019ll be at support groups. Nonprofit organizations that focus on mental health resources, provide excellent help. Please reach out to them. You\u2019ll find people that can relate to you. \n\nThere are moments where we feel so lost, as if we\u2019re just trekking forward without a destination. Our destination is there, it\u2019s just foggy. You\u2019ve worked so hard to get to this point, if you feel like it\u2019s pointless, remember that how you\u2019re feeling does not determine the value of your hard work. There are days that it will be clear, although few, remember that feeling. Hold on to it. One day, with guidance, you will look up and see your destination, and waiting for you are the people that held on to you. Or maybe a person. Heck even a good doggo. But one thing is for sure, you are not alone. I walked in the same path, and although I haven\u2019t made it to my destination, it seems a lot less darker and the hard days are few. \n\nI\u2019m rooting for you!",

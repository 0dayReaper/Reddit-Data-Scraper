    "postText": "I speak with my therapist and they disregard everything I say, nod, change the dosages of my meds and send me back home. It happens so often that I just lie to them and tell them that everything is ok because I'm tired of disappointing them because I'm not getting better \n\nI post my problems online and I just get horrible anxiety about how my posts will be recieved since I feel as if my problems are nothing in comparison to others and that I'm just seeking attention \n\nI reach out to friends and tell them everything that's on my mind, I feel awful for burdening them with MY issues and when they start giving me obvious dumb advice (it's not their fault, I don't expect them to be psychiatrists) and then I nod my head, pretend that I hadn't already tried what they suggested and move on \n\nI reach out to family and they start telling me that my illness is exaggerated/an excuse or they give me obvious advice or they just tell me to get over it and on special occasions I make them feel bad for me so much that they cry. Again, I don't expect them to be psychiatrists and don't blame them at all for their reactions\n\nIt's not anyone's fault I feel this way, I simply don't want to hurt anyone. I have fully accepted my fate, I will never feel joy or relaxation ever again, but I shall never ever make it anyone's problem ever again, I'll nod and move on hoping to get run over by a car or shot in the head one day, since suicide will destroy everyone I care about \n\nWhy am I posting this? Isn't this hypocritical? I don't know what to do anymore, I guess it's my OCD making me post this or its just me being an awful disgusting attention seeker, who knows... I certainly don't anymore.",

    "postText": "I\u2019ve been good for a while after starting meds and therapy. Maybe a year now? My sense of time is not great today. \n\nIt\u2019s painful being here again, in this state. I\u2019m sleeping too much, no energy, I\u2019m snappy and defensive, paranoid and insecure\u2026comparing myself to other women just to tear myself apart. \n\nI\u2019m sitting here trying to figure out what to do with myself. Trying to find a scary movie and a good snack. Just get cozy and relax. Nothing sounds good to watch, or listen to, or read, or do. My boyfriend just left the house and now I\u2019m wondering if I should\u2019ve gone with him to hangout with our friends instead of declining and staying in. \n\nBut I know I\u2019ll be okay again soon\u2026 even if I have to claw my way back to myself. I just want my energy back, and the confidence I worked really hard on.",

            "comment": "After a decade of depression, I was actually depression free for 2 years. No reason. But in recent months, I\u2019ve been depressed again. Also no reason. And it\u2019s full on bad too. I can objectively tell myself that it literally got better to the point that it was gone, and so that can definitely happen again, and that I should have hope. But then I also just legitimately feel that I\u2019ll never be good again, like I\u2019m certain about that. It\u2019s an exhausting battle. I was more confident that it would pass earlier on, but week after week it\u2019s not been getting any better overall. I\u2019ll have a couple days that things feel normal again every once in a while, but then that\u2019ll be followed up with many more days of feeling super low. I do hope it gets better for you again. And myself. And that people here can somehow feel better too. It\u2019s tough though.",

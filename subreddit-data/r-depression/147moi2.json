    "postText": "I'm 26. \nI'm unemployed and I wanted to study further but I can't concentrate at all. \nI used to be so smart and so motivated. I got the highest grades in school and college. And then I got depressed. I can't function now. I just fail fail and fail at everything. \nI've wasted my 20s. I don't have a job. I have chronic health problems. My family has some problems that make it hard for me to be happy. I was suicidal for 3 years so I dropped out of grad school. I can't go back now and I wanted to but I can't concentrate and I can't study. \nMy family had high expectations of me. I too did. But I'm just a failure now. I don't know why they can't be happy with me just existing and not trying to achieve something big. It's too overwhelming for me.",

Believe in yourself and don't give up. The point of living is doing what makes you happy. Pursue your passions regardless of what life throws at you. You're not alone. Not giving up is what makes you exceptional.",

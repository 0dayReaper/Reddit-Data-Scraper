    "postText": "Nobody was ever laughing with me. They were laughing AT me. The only reason they ever wanted me alive was just to have someone to laugh at all the time. Yeah, like they were ever better than I was. I DIDNT SNITCH. I HAD A MAKE PARENTAL FIGURE. I WAS BETTER THAN THEM IN EVERY WAY. I AM BETTER THAN THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL FUCKING SACKS OF FUCKING SHIT. NEGATIVITY IS LIFE. LIFE US NEGATIVITY. CYNICISM IS THE NEW WAY. IT HOW WE WILL GROW AND PROSPER FROM THESE DARK AGES WE CURRENTLY LIVE IN. SOCIETYS WILL IMPROVE. I COULD START A HOLOCAUST AGAINST HAPPY PEOPLE IF I WANTED TO, WITH THE RESOURCES I HAVE. THE ONLY RESON I HAVEN'T COMMITED DIE YET IS BECAUSE I KNOW THINGS THAT THE FAKE FUCKERS DON'T. ONE IS THAT WORDS DO NOT HAVE POWER. TWO IS THAT POSITIVITY IS RETARTED. THREE MY WAY IS THE NEW WAY.",

I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve been through so much that you feel this way. I can tell you\u2019ve experienced a lot of pain.\n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an idiot though (like u said in part 1). You also talked about positive ppl trying to point out good things about you and you don\u2019t seem to believe them. I\u2019m really fucked up and broken myself but I still believe there are positives in most ppl. That\u2019s not to say society doesn\u2019t influence ppl and bring out the bad sides of them too but I do think there are positives in most ppl. I don't think you\u2019re excluded from that, so I think they were probably telling you the truth.\n\nI have a feeling that all this anger isn\u2019t so much about hurting others as it is about the pain you feel. I wish I could help but I doubt I can help anyone as I can\u2019t even help myself. Just know we are listening to you and we don\u2019t want you to feel so alone.",

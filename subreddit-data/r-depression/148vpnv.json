    "postText": "Well, when I was a junior I met who is now my first and only friend. I am a very shy person and he has been the only person to really care about me, he is amazing. The problem is that we recently graduated from High School and will be going to different universities. I will move approximately 2h 30min from where I currently live. I'm really worried about being alone in college and not seeing my best friend as often as I'd like. I feel very depressed practically all the time and I wonder if I made the right decision to go so far from him.",

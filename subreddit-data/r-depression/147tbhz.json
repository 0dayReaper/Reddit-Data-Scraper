    "postText": "I think I need help\n\nWhy have kids if you\u2019re not rich? Think about it\u2026 it\u2019s cruel. Because your parents did it? Because a book told you to do it? Because you want to compete with your other family members? Because that\u2019s what humanity does? You wanted to add another cog to the machine? That\u2019s stupid. If you make that decision, you\u2019re a piece of ****.\n\nMy old ass working class parents thought it\u2019d be a good idea to have kids\u2026 why? So they could struggle for the rest of their lives raising me? So they could divorce while I\u2019m in my senior year of high school trying to figure this all out?\n\nThey fight all day every day. Adults really only think about themselves, don\u2019t they? I\u2019m filled with hate.\n\nYour child is seriously considering the \u201ccoward\u2019s way out\u201d and you\u2019re okay with that. I\u2019m sick. Nothing matters.",

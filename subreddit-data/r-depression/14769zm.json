    "postText": "Hi, so I\u2019ll get to the point. I was diagnosed with \u201cdepressive disorder with visual hallucinations\u201d when I was 14, it\u2019s gone untreated ever since and idrk what to do, I\u2019m currently 16 (almost 17) and I\u2019ve been in therapy for about 3 almost 4 years now and it\u2019s not helped, I\u2019ve tried requesting meds and my doctors have refused, just wandering if there\u2019s any advice anyone can give to just kinda cope? Like anything that\u2019s been able to help them hold on to life at all? Any kind of thought processes, diets, natural treatments etc that can help numb the symptoms? I used to self harm but I stopped that and I\u2019ve abused alcohol pretty badly to the point I\u2019ve ended up in hospital, I just want some kind of healthy coping mechanism that could help",

It may also be the therapist themselves, perhaps it's not the right fit\n\nHaving vitamin or mineral deficiencies will make your mental health struggles more difficult, so try getting a blood test and taking supplements if you have any deficiencies \n\nI found practising mindfulness very helpful \n\nFinding something to work towards that is meaningful to you would be helpful. For me it's university study in an area of great interest to me, as well as the desire to one day travel to a city I'm fascinated by",

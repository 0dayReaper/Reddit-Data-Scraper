    "postText": "this would have been around 1990 or so, I was early twenties age.\n\nI was unemployed, living with parents, recently dumped by girlfriend. Just wouldnt' get out of bed. Parents dragged me to family doctor.   \"you have this new thing, Clinical Depression.  You'll have to take these pills for the rest of your life\"\n\nIn the ensuing years, antidepressants were a financial bonanza for the pill manufacturers.\n\nThe only possibly good thing to come out of that was, when I told people that I had Clinical Depression, they didn't look at me funny and run away. Everyone said, \"Oh yeah, my boss and my cousin have that too\"......the incessant ads on TV sledgehammered into shallow lazy minds that \"this is common and normal\"\n\nWell, you mileage may vary, but my opinion is that psychology, psychiatry and depression pharmacology have about as much scientific validity as phrenology or astrology.\n\nI think the practitioners are mostly quacks, and the methodology to compile the DSM is garbage.\n\nI am not big on tin foil hat junk, but did you ever stop to think.....poverty, overcrowding, pollution and other things end up causing a revolt.\n\nThe rich can numb up the workers, and even get the animals to pay for the poisons that keep them enslaved.",

            "comment": "It's true that psychology is open to interpretation which is a fancy way to say that we are guessing.  There is no lab where we can test our findings because of how complex the problem is.  They can make estimations and do things by trial and error.  At best we can give a person a pill that will let him\\\\her function at worse we can get the person killed.   I think its a bit unfair to compare it to astrology but that is your right. \n\nI sincerely believe that every person needs somebody to speak with, professionals are just better because they are neutral, and you don't have to feel guilty talking to them.\n\nI believe some need medication, but I also know that we are overprescribing medication partly because Doctors don't want to deny patients what they want even if it's not in their best interest for fear of being shamed or sued.  \n\nIt's a complicated issue with no simple answer.  I have no doubt that people are getting rich off the misery of other people. It's not a conspiracy it's just a fact.  I just don't think we are dealing with an equilibrium dystopian thing here.",

                    "comment": "So, when you see a new patient, the first thing you say is \"psychology is open to interpretation, we are just guessing\", right?\n\nWhere is your proof that \"everybody\" needs somebody to speak with?   \n\nProfessionals are anything BUT neutral.  I defy you to prove otherwise.  I can prove to you that a person saying the exact same thing to ten different \"therapists\" can and will walk out with ten different contradictory diagnoses.... because I AM LIVING PROOF.\n\nThey ask leading questions that will produce answers to make the patient fit the type of therapy they chose to train in.  It's all about the MONEY.\n\nNo therapist will ever say, \"There is a tiny chance these antidepressant pills will make you feel better, but there is a 100% chance that they will cause liver damage\"\n\nAnd what a scam it is!  Absolutely no requirement to produce tangible results. No other practitioner will ever testify against you, and the most vulnerable, desperate and malleable customers possible. \n\nIt is EXACTLY the same as astrology!  PSEUDO SCIENCE!\n\nYou are just as big a scumbag as televangelists!\n\n\"feel good, even though I will do NOTHING to solve your problems!\"",

                            "comment": "Yes, you are making a guess an educated guess. All you have is the word of the patient. There are no instruments we can use to diagnose patients so it's up to the patient and we know how dangerous that can be. That is why you talk to a professional so they can try to decipher your thoughts and symptoms.\n\nI am not saying everybody needs a therapist but that everybody needs somebody they can confide in.  It's just easier to speak with somebody you can pay because they can't flake out on you like a friend. Some people don't even have friends so who do they confide in? I don't have proof of this it's just human nature. How do I prove that we need a person to talk to about our problems or to help us through a difficult time?\n\nYou misunderstood me when I said neutral. I mean the person does not know you and won't side against you because of his\\\\her bias against you. For example, I can't talk to my mother about a problem I have because she will talk from her bias, and she will not necessarily give me advise that is good for me if it goes against her bias. That is what I meant by it. I understand that conflicting or different advice will be given from therapists, it's all subjective and differs from person to person.\n\nI am not sure why your therapist never discussed all the side effects with you but mine sure did.  He gave me the whole list and at the end he told me it's up to you to decide if the benefits outweigh the negatives.  If your therapist is leading you then the onus falls on you to tell the person \"That is not what I said\" and steer the conversation back.  Not justifying it but I have never had a therapist do that.  It also depends on which country you are from, I guess.  I know that America it's all about the money, so they are just trying to push the numbers but from where I am from, we don't get that and to be fair \"legit\" doctors also push medication on people for money it's not unique to psychology.\n\nPseudo means, sham or fake.  I just don't agree with that. We have mountains of clinical data pertaining mental health and the brain. These things are peer reviewed as much as it can be reviewed according to the clinical data. Astrology is nothing like that.  There is no peer reviewed, verifiable data on the subject. It's all just talking with no clinical data.\n\nI agree a pill does not fix your life. The point of it is to get to a space where you can rectify your life. No phycologist has ever told me that this is a permanent solution.  In fact, the last one I was at told me that he gives me a year on the pills then he is taking me off. So, I have a year to rectify my life, basically.  As we know some people will use it as a Band-Aid and never fix anything because it's the easier option.  There is a lot of corruption in the field that I will agree with but that does not make it a bogus field.\n\nI will end this wall of text by saying I am sorry you are going through this and that some snake oil salesmen sold you a shit bill of goods.  I hope you get the help that you need.",

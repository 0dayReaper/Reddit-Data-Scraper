    "postText": "I am such a scoundrel, I reek of a sickly pathetic sort of dramatism- as if I am my own self-made tragic hero with the amateurish script and stage, save the cape. I don't know what to do in life. I'm thinking of maybe volunteering, but even that feels like some dramatic overreach and not wholly sincere. I hate every part of my being. My voice, my height, my face, my very soul itself disgusts me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI hate to hear myself talk, to read my words. Even now, reading this, I am disgusted. I don't even know what I'm doing but I'm doing it all mindlessly. Maybe I'll figure something out. It's hard to think.",

    "postText": "I have been depressed for the last 10 years but have been decently okay at masking it with outbursts here and there. Recently after multiple head injuries it has become worse than ever. Now ex attempted suicide and later told me she would rather have been dead that with me any longer. Have seriously contemplated offing myself every day for the last few months but too much of a pu$$y to do it and I just can\u2019t see myself going any longer",

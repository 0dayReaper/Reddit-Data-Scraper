I don\u2019t know why the little things are are randomly hitting me so hard. Normally my suicidal thoughts are about things I find to at least be understandable (like loneliness, work, financial/housing insecurity, general boredom, etc). Now I\u2019m just genuinely confused about why I feel *this* depressed over not buying a pair of pants\u2026 I should *not* be considering suicide for this\u2026",

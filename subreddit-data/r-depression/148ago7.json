    "postText": "Gonna pour my heart out. Here goes nothing. Every single time I (20F) think about my future, I instantly feel suicidal. It\u2019s so uncertain and I don\u2019t have anything going for me, no matter how hard I try. I thought moving halfway across the country would help, which it did in a sense, but I still feel so pessimistic about everything. No matter how far I move, or try to turn things around, I will always have the \u201cnothing matters bc i\u2019m gonna die eventually\u201d mentality. I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m so uninspired. I want to get out of this loop, but I don\u2019t think I ever will. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder last year, and sometimes I feel like that information hasn\u2019t sunken in yet. I know it\u2019s true, I\u2019ve been depressed since I was young. It\u2019s the fact that this sadness will follow me around forever, and this is just how my brain is. That\u2019s so tough to wrap my head around. Seeing people my age being successful, or working towards their dreams really triggers these negative thoughts. Especially because I have zero goals or ideas in the slightest of what I\u2019d like to do with my life. I spent too much of my youth trying to not end my life, surving an abusive household, rather than focusing on developing hobbies or discovering my strengths. I\u2019ve tried college and it\u2019s not for me, but I also don\u2019t wanna work a minimum wage job forever. On top of that, having adhd, autism, and a learning disability makes everything feel impossible. I\u2019m not sure of what I CAN do. I try, try, try, and try again, but my efforts are not enough. I just feel so useless. Everyone always says \u201cit\u2019ll get better\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019ll figure it out\u201d. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever get better. I have to live with my defective brain forever, even if I find ways to manage it. And in terms of \u201cfiguring it out\u201d\u2026will I? I have all odds against me. I might just have to work a minimum wage job until I die. Today\u2019s world is not built for neurodivergent folks such as myself. My future is so uncertain and empty. It\u2019s so scary. Sometimes I wish I could just end my life, instead of living, achieving nothing but complaining like I am now. It also doesn\u2019t help that I don\u2019t have a support system or any friends at all. My experiences are isolating enough as it is, but it hurts to know that in the end, I really am alone in all of this. I truly don\u2019t want to be here anymore. I have no place in this world. I guess this is where my anxiety comes in handy\u2026I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever have the guts to end my life. For now I will just fantasize about it, whilst figuring out what I want from life, and who I\u2019d like to become.",

            "comment": "You mentioned being isolated. I think you should start looking for a support group. It\u2019s not easy, but it is oh so important. This sounds like it\u2019s out of a self help book but I\u2019m serious, people are not only there to be a friend, they can give you a whole new perspective on life. \n\nA friend could open the door to a different job, a cool place to hang out, a new passion, hobby, and any number of things you didn\u2019t know about before. Sure, friends aren\u2019t the all encompassing answer to every problem ever, but it sure makes things a hell of a lot better. \n\nIt may not feel like it, but there are so so many people in this world. And they are just like you. They\u2019re looking for friends, maybe a partner, anything. What I mean is that there ARE options. Plenty, you just gotta go out there and look. It\u2019s not easy but I can\u2019t stress enough how important it is.\n\nI couldn\u2019t really tell you some miracle fix, I often feel just like you, many people on this subreddit do as well. But friends, some kind of support. That is the best place to start in my opinion.\n\nAlthough I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with therapy, if you aren\u2019t I\u2019d suggest looking into it. I know it\u2019s a common suggestion but it can help.\n\nI hope that this was somewhat helpful, and I truly hope you find yourself, your passion. Because there\u2019s no doubt that you have a purpose, and that you\u2019re valuable. That\u2019s not just some throwaway line, it\u2019s factually true. I wish you well :)",

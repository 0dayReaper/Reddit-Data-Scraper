    "postText": "hey, i\u2019ve never posted on here but i\u2019m hoping to at least have a brief conversation with someone who actually understands. here goes\u2026\n\ni moved to the north of england (from the south) to be with my boyfriend late last year - hometown is now about 4hrs away. i have had depression since i was about 12 (i was diagnosed with a chronic illness that fucked me up when i was 10y/o), and i knew this would be difficult from the get-go. i told my boyfriend as much, and also asked if we could trial living together, but it was kind of brushed over as if it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal\u2026\n\nflash forward to 9 months down the line, and i am more depressed than i have ever felt in my life. like, i thought i knew depression pretty well, but my god. now i really know it. i haven\u2019t been able to go to work this week (a job that i genuinely love) because i just feel totally exhausted. i feel emotionally numb and physically sick.\n\nmy issue is that when i am having a really bad time with my depression, it makes my boyfriend cry and become very upset and quiet. of course this makes me feel totally awful, as i can see that i have upset him (a man that doesn\u2019t suffer with mh issues) too, leading to me becoming even more upset, mentally and sometimes physically beating myself up. i just hate that i do this to him, it absolutely breaks my heart over and over again every time this happens.\n\ni also feel that i really would like someone to take the reins when i am mentally drained but i often feel like i need to use what little energy i have to muster up a way to help him to feel better. often these conversations end with him saying \u201cthank you i feel a lot better\u201d after i have comforted him, however i quite often feel much worse &amp; like things are unresolved and carry that with me.\n\nwe have probably had at least 10 conversations that follow this format.\n\nthis has led to me feeling quite uncomfortable about speaking to him about the way i\u2019m feeling at all. i stop myself from talking about things because i have seen how much it can upset him, and how the conversation is unproductive in my opinion.\n\ni feel totally alone. i feel scared to say anything, to start any conversations about how i feel, because it is never helpful for either one of us, and just makes us both really upset.\n\ni have started feeling my depression physically - stomach pain, feeling sick, sleeping a lot, feeling exhausted, chest pain\u2026\n\ni just feel like i am getting worse and worse and worse, and that really scares me. i feel i am holding a lot in but i do not know how to feel comfortable enough to talk any more.\n\ni have a counsellor, who does help, but costs quite a lot, so i can\u2019t afford to see her very often unfortunately. i am also on mirtazapine.\n\ni don\u2019t know if this makes any sense or what i\u2019m asking for or what, i guess i just am making last ditch efforts to connect",

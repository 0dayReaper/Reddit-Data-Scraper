    "postText": "Already posted this in another sub but whatever. \n\nI had depression in highschool until the end of sophomore year. I got over it eventually, and I fixed everything about myself. I got good friends, I ate healthy, I exercised, I completely stopped self harming, I ended my pornography addiction and I am officially 1 year clean, I got a job, I bought all the stuff I wanted for art or D&amp;D and legos, I started writing, I started sleeping well, I got way good at drawing, I learned a second language, I improved my relationship with every single person around me. My parents, friends, extended family, everyone loves me and I love all of them. I have so much to be grateful for. Unfortunately, I am miserable, and have been for the past year. these past 5 months have been especially difficult. I am finding no joy in any of the things I do. Nothing I draw is good enough, I have severe burnout, no ideas for writing, there is nothing productive I can do that brings me joy. Sitting still and taking a break on social media or watching a movie or reading a book or sleeping just makes it worse. I'm absolutely stumped. I have never had a difficult life, and my life now should be wonderful given my circumstances. I've tried everything. Therapy, changing habits, diets, hobbies, hanging out with different people, literally everything I can think of, but everything just feels so difficult and fruitless. There is no reward that comes from any of the good things I am doing. I started self-harming again, the temptation to go back to pornography is growing, I've started having panic attacks, I am slowly withdrawing from my friends, although a large portion of them have already stopped talking to me for a reason I am unsure of. I mean, If theres a problem and I can do something about it, no worries, right? if there's a problem and i cant do anything about it, then there is no use fussing about it. But this is different, the problem is my own brain and how it is thinking, and there is absolutely NO REASON behind any of it. I should be fine. I should be more than fine, I should be jumping for joy, but its just empty. Nothing means anything to me. Last time I had depression I had created a plan to end everything, and now, I am facing my greatest fear again. I've talked to my parents about all of this, minus the self harm and suicidal thoughts portion. My mom would start crying if she heard anything about that. But I have told my therapist everything. I have another meeting with him on wednesday. I don't know what else to do.",

            "comment": "It just happens sometimes, I think you should talk to everyone you know, your mom would cry if you died, you should talk to her about your problems, start on a more light-hearted note, then tell her about your deeper problems. I am certain that she would be very supportive, if your friends don\u2019t talk to you because you have depression, you shouldn\u2019t think about them at all",

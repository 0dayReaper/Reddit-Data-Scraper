    "postText": "My bf is really depressed right now and he got so overwhelmed the other day he pretty much just cut me off. I really love him and I'm not ready to give up on him. I've struggled with severe depression in the past and while I wanted to be alone to rest deep down I wish I didn't have to deal with it alone I just didn't know how to communicate my needs at the time and the guilt was overwhelming I just shut down instead. Now that I'm not as depressed anymore I want to be there for my bf even if he needs space I'm worried about leaving him alone for too long. Should I reach out to him in a couple of days? Does anyone have advice on how to deal with this properly?",

I also hate life. but I also keep reminding myself that it will get better maybe its a false hope but at least it is what makes me wake up and go to this shit job that I don't like. just have hope and try to think what really makes you happy and do that, and try to go out instead of watching movies. I go alone outside all the time during my time off. it's just a  natural healing for me. all the best",

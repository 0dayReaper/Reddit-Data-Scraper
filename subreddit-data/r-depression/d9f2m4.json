Sometimes it's difficult to think there's more to life than just doing the mandatory things and then playing video games the rest of the time as well as quick exercise every other day. It makes me depressed to think that people are out there socializing and enjoying it, making meaningful connections with people and having romantic relationships. \n\nI think however, I have lots of time to myself, peace and quiet and I am quite comfortable when I get to just be alone and use my PC. But sometimes it feels like I might as well be hooked into a machine that provides me  a maintenance amount of joy for the rest of my life, without experiencing anything. In the past years that I've been depressed, nothing has actually happened and the years just went by. You'd think time runs slower when nothing happens. But it doesn't when you procrastinate everything. Maybe procrastination is a way to make time appear to be running quickly. Once you've suffered through that time you realize that every day is so similar that it all has just went away. Days you will never get back. But I guess everyone has periods of time like that at some point of their lives.",

My therapist says my life isn't as easy as my brain makes it out to be, and that depression makes it harder. I tend to compare myself who have it harder and yet achieve more than me, but my therapist doesn't like that kind of thinking. Something something, everyone has different sorts of problems and that keeping trying despite hardship like depression equals resilience.  If the things my therapist tells me are to be believed, from another perspective than the depressed one, fighting all this depression crap takes resilience.  Even if it doesn't feel like that from down here.",

I think I only have friends bc I\u2019ve spent time with them. But outta sight, outta mind and I struggle to change that.",

You see your therapist.  You do the best you can to take care of yourself.  You will have good times.  You will have bad and shitty times.  Most of the time you will have meh times.  That's what living with depression is.  It's a fucking nightmare.  Why make it worse by blaming yourself for a condition you had zero control or choice in?  Would you blame someone for their heart condition?",

Just like you don't ask for asthma or arthritis, you don't just magically conjure up clinical depression. Obviously you can make it worse (like if you smoke while diagnosed with lung cancer), but it's still very much a disease, an addiction.\n\nIt's not your fault you're sick. It sucks to put it that way, but that's where you can start getting better. Idk, it helps me to think about it like that.",

Throughout 3-13 was abuse and 13-15 was neglect since 3-13 mum was mad that dad left and blamed me and 13-15 mum forgot about me and left with step dad. I wouldn\u2019t say it is hard since I\u2019m not on the streets and I have two jobs meaning I don\u2019t starve or struggle much with bills",

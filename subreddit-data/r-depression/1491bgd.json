    "postText": "Why do i feel like shit every day? Why does everyone seem fake to me? Why am i wasting my time? What the hell am i supposed to do? Why am i so fucking insecure? Why? Why can't i focus? Why do i seek attention everywhere? Why can't I have normal conversations? Why is my mind full of bitches shaking their asses? Why can't I quit porn? Why can't I make meaningful relationships? Why can't I enjoy my life? Why am I this way? Why is the internet so addictive? Why do i still think about the girl who kicked me out of her life a year ago? Why can't I forget her? Why am i so poor? Why am I losing interest in my hobbies? Why does my body hurt so much? Why am i not happy? Why am I alone? Why does no one give a fuck bout me? Why do i have to spend hours on the phone and watch shitty things? Why is the world so distracting? Why does no one care? Why am i living this way? Why can't i wake up? Why doesn't the coffee taste same as before?",

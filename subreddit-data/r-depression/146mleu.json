    "postText": "Hi everyone! I think I\u2019m at a point where cognitive behavioral therapy with ssris has helped but I\u2019m at a stage where I just feel like it\u2019s not working any more. I\u2019ve been thinking about searching for therapists that specialize in dbt. I\u2019m hoping a change in therapy type will make a difference. I\u2019ve been in therapy for the last four years. Has anyone tried talk therapies other than cbt? If so how did that work out for you?",

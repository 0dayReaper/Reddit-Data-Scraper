    "postText": "I\u2018m 23 and I have depression. I wake up and go to work and do other things I\u2018m supposed to do. Often I notice in the back of my head, sad thoughts. When I sit still they come to me and I just feel sad and feel stomach pains. \nI\u2018m 4 years single and that long time being lonely is something stressing me. \nBeing depressed makes these lonely feelings more intense and I see no way out. \n\nI read in the internet that when you feel like that you should meet with people and do hobbys. I do that but my mind still can\u2018t be quiet. It\u2018s always in the back of my head. I want to not feel lonely but I don\u2018t know how. When nothing helps I start smoking weed that\u2018s my only escape. \nThe reason I feel more lonely now is that I got ignored from a girl. She\u2018s very pretty, we talked on ig, she wanted to meet me but somehow she ignored me. When I was in the city with my parents I saw her and I felt very uncomfortable. I just looked away, so frustrating.",

    "postText": "i feel like i\u2019ve tried everything and nothing helps. I\u2019ve been depressed with anhedonia, low energy, low motivation, and fatigue for about 2 years. I\u2019ve been trying to find something to help but nothing makes a big enough difference i\u2019ve tried 4 different ssri and Wellbutrin as well as tons of supplements, methylated vitamins, nootropics, lifestyle improvements, but nothing works. I\u2019m going to go to an endocrinologist to hopefully get my horomones checked out to maybe explain my situation but i know my thyroid is already good from previous tests. If this doesn\u2019t work i don\u2019t know what to do anymore or where to go. i\u2019m giving up and just wanted to check if anyone has any suggestions for reasons for my symptoms that i may not have expected or explored yet. thank you",

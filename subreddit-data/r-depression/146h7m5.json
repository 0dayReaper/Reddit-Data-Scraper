We have never fought this hard.  I don't expect him to pick me over his son.\n\nHow can I try to fix this?",

            "comment": "Sounds like a lot of communication is needed. I'm not making excuses for the kid at all, but from his point of view you're probably not his favorite human and teenagers are going through their own crap. Talk with the husband, write your feelings down and give him a letter, or send him a link to a video. Communication is key for any relationship. Then if that all falls through, try and get him into a couples therapy, or family with all three. You have eight years of together, if it was good at some point, it is probably worth fighting for. He should also be fighting for it, but may be oblivious, ignorant, or damaged in his own way. If the fighting is escalating maybe he has stress issues also and could use some therapy?\n\nGet outside professional assistance if possible if the communication fails. Above all, stay safe. If words turn to swings, bail. You are a valued person not an object for someone to relieve their stress out on. We all have our own struggles. We make commitments to help our partners bear theirs and them bear ours, but no one can handle it all alone. Good luck to you and take care of yourself.",

I promised myself that I would never do it again.\n\nMy current husband hit me once and I got violent back and made it very clear to him that I was a relatively tough chick, and I wouldn't put up with it. PERIOD!  (That was 7 years ago)\n\nI know he has a lot of stress on his shoulders.   He just lost his job.  His son got thrown into juvie and expelled from school.  I'm trying really hard to be here for him, but it's tough sometimes. \n\nEspecially when he is my main support system and he keeps dissing me.",

Sounds like you're trying your best and he needs a different outlet for his frustrations. There's no reason to dis you if you chose each other, remind him of that? Hope you figure this out.",

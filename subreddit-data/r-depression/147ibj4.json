    "postText": "I'm a few years from graduating hs, and I feel like I'm messing myself up for the future. I'm pretty sure I'm going to commit sometime in the future, but knowing me I'll freak out and not do it and then I'll end up in a future that I didn't want. I've already got sh scars that aren't fading anytime soon, and I've lost so many friends just by opening up to them. I'm not doing enough to set myself up, and if I look back in the future its going to be awful thinking about what could've been.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI barely have any hobbies, and the ones I do have are stupid and aren't really going to go anywhere in the future. I don't many irl friends that I actively talk to. I don't have anything going for me at the moment. I'm just a worse version of other people, with the added bonus of being sad looking and a high likely hood of ruining your day. Every talent that I have another person can do it 10x better and then more. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThere isn't a high chance I'll change either, its here to stay. There isn't a point in trying to tell people about it or open up to them, because I'll just ruin their day and possibly make them hate me even more than they already do. If I don't change something (which clearly I'm incapable of doing) I'll just stay like this until I die.",

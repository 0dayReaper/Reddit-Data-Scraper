I cause frustration and annoyance to my partner, my friends, and my family. I panic when I make people upset and I don\u2019t know why. I just want to be functional but I can\u2019t. I feel anger when I mess up slightly, I hit myself when I mess up. I want to die. I have a therapist, I have meds but I can\u2019t ever remember to take them. I can\u2019t remember to brush my teeth I feel gross and I don\u2019t know what to do.",

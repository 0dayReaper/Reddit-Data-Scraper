My parents convinced my grandparents I was a failing out of highschool and doing drugs (which I wasn't I was actually going to graduate early) so they would pay for a \"treatment program\" for me.  I even did a whole array of psychological tests at this place called \"Bodin\" where they said that I had depression and anxiety but didn't appear to have any of the markers for drug addiction.  Parent's were like \"nope he's definitely a drug addict.\"  So I got pulled from high school and shipped off to a different state to spend almost 2 years in various blackout programs (meaning they keep you very confined and bubbled in with no contact or information from the outside world... basically a cult.)  They hold you until you turn 18 and then tell you to fuck off and you have to go try and make it all on your own.  In a state you aren't familiar with with no friends or family and no support.  Make things even better I finally got out of that program in 2007... just before the fucking economic crash.  My life has been utter shit and I wish I was dead every single day.  My parents continued to tell the rest of my family I was a fuckup to ensure I got no support.  My whole family looks down on me as a piece of trash, and doesn't communicate with me all because I had parents who just didn't want to do it anymore.  I'm probably going to kill myself soon because there is just nothing for me to do at this point.  I'm pissing into the wind and howling at the moon.\n\nYou might say \"but all that sounds illegal.\"  Yeah... it's fuckin' supposed to be.  Good luck finding anyone who gives a shit.  That program gets shut down like every couple years and just opens in a new state under a new name.",

They were always pretty anti religious liberals which is why getting sent to a place that made you pray and go to church and shit was kind of a mind job.\n\nBasically the story goes like this.  My mom's husband died, and when she was still mourning she met my dad.  My dad was a drug addict from a wealthy family who knows how to put on a really good act for people and tell them what they want to hear.  He had been cut off from his family money at this time so he basically needed someone to use.  I have mixed stories about whether I was planned or an accident but it seems they decided to have me because they thought it would fix holes in their life.  My mom wanted me to take the pain of her dead husband away, my dad wanted me to legitimize him to his family so he could get money from them again.\n\nEventually they realize they never wanted to be together, and they never wanted me.  They were married at this point so my dad could use my moms health insurance for rehab.  He spent the next 8 or so years spiraling out of control and being abusive.  Finally he left and ended up on the streets for a few years.  Well I still thought that if he quit drugs I could have a dad so I was telling his parents he needed treatment... and they finally got him treatment.  Thing is after that he wanted nothing to do with me anymore.  He wanted a new life and I wasn't part of it.  That's when he started convincing everyone I was \"following in his footsteps\" with drugs when I really wasn't.  My mom just sorta went along with it all because she's pretty much been checked out since that husband died from what I can tell and never really wanted to do the work.\n\nThey were looking for hallmark child rearing moments and immediately got tired of the actual work that comes with it.  That's basically it.  They are very self absorbed people who just didn't have the natural instinct to be parents.  The two sides of the family hated each other and did not mix.  Dad's family didn't like mom, mom's family didn't like dad... neither family or parents like me.  I became the scapegoat.  \n\nI tried to tell my childhood story to people in the family but man if they don't all just treat me as if... well as if I'm my drug addict lying charlatan of a father so nobody believes a thing I say.  It's amazing how they so quickly accepted him back and passed his shit torch onto me.  So now everyone acts like I'm the big dead beat POS who didn't make something of myself... even though I literally wasn't allowed to graduate highschool.  My dad's mom recently called me a \"dry well\" the last time I asked for any sort of support or contact..",

This is my first post on reddit, after browsing along for a couple years now. I actually did this last september. Leave everything behind I mean. I also have nothing really that (no matter how selfish it sounds considering what I really have) I suppose I deem \"enough\" to keep me here. I have a dog, my parents, siblings, other family, a job, and in september actually I had 2 jobs. But none of this gave me any sense of purpose if that makes sense. In all honesty, it still doesnt. Nothing makes me happy, but happiness was off the table many years before this so that doesnt matter. So instead of happiness, I sought out a sense of purpose. After a few attempts at my life of course. I went on a couple years like this until I decided not to anymore, and unlike many others (I assume), I didnt decide to leave a note, because just the thought of writing another one seemed...unnecessary, because if I were to die, what would the reason matter to anyone? No. instead I just purchased a flight to the other side of the world to see if maybe leaving everything behind and starting a new life would mean exactly what it sounded like. A new life. One where I wouldnt be so damn miserable. Didnt work, and I argue with myself constantly on whether I was better...or more mentally/emotionally stable rather, before I had left. I purchased my flight 2 days in advanced. had enough time to really seal in my decision, and I did it. Didnt tell a soul. The morning of I recieved quite a few phone calls from my jobs, a couple confused voicemails, but I already made up my mind so screw it, right? I made a lot of bad decisions in my life, and that wasnt the worst, but it was pretty bad, and unfortunately nothing changed. Nothing got better rather, only worse.",

You took that step into the unknown and that takes courage. I believe that you should keep taking those steps, maybe not to run away but to face those demons that have been hurting you. Maybe somewhere in your life right now can be a purpose, a road to happiness that can fulfill you the way you deserve to be.

I had to go through 3 parental divorces and the replacements made it never be the same again.\n\nMy mom seemed to love me, until she met my step dad (aka no longer step dad, but brothers father) and that's when I was introduced into neglect. She divorced my dad when I was born and married this rich Persian man (best dad ever.. bought me presents and said...let her be a kid!!). Gosh dammettyttt take me back. \n\nMy dad got a whole new family after divorcing and met my step mom. It was good, then bad, then good (once I grew to the age I am now) with the relationship with her. But my God. Let's call my mom's ex bf/brothers dad X and my dad dad Y.\n\nMy mom lived in ga with X and I'm from California, but have stayed with my dad Y. For years, until I was 17 I moved to California for a year then back to Georgia. Eventually, things started getting bad at both homes. By the time I got to 13 I moved every 6 months. It took 6 months for them to miss me at my dad's and can't stand it at my mom's. Vice versa for my dad's and step mom and can't stand it at my dad's. Neglect is everywhere. Eventually, my dad got a divorce around 16 to 17. I have great adaptibility skills. But by God I hate my life. It's like, my adaptibility grew my Naivity and gullibility (if that's a word). Now, I believe everyone or every man that likes me, because of my skill of adaptibility as a child. I can literally adapt to anything quite quickly. So relationships with drug addicts ( I don't even do drugs) is like a moth to a flame. What a frickin hinderance and epiphany. I can't believe this shit. This also means I never got the support I needed or can remember it for a steady foundation, so I cant have/ don't possess an understanding of what a steady mental &amp; physical self feels like.",

If they didn't get it, I'd be treated like a nuisance. The pain when you can't react or break down and cry, cause you know they will only comfort you're when crying but return to themselves. So you can't cry. It's that moment i turned the tears in that make me feel sociopathic. So so so extremely desensitized cause the pain is so immense. Depression is all that's left over after that. \n\nMaybe I should pick up readings again. Idk why, anytime I give readings I can't seem to get the information for myself only others.

I could sit at the table there because it is where I used to study outside Swem in 2013.*\n\n\n# I ----\n\n\u201cIt got scary once the gaps started showing up. It was, and is  really, like I can only access certain segments at certain times; or I should say, in certain states. I know the steps I have to take to solve the problem, but I never follow through. The plans, the lists, the calendars, they all fade with the mindset which inspired them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cChris, I\u2019m gonna stop you right there. We are in Aromas, not a therapy room. Though caffeine is not the best thing for you, which I think we both know, it\u2019s a coffee shop; you\u2019re supposed to relax here.\u201d James said leaning back in his chair. \u201cHave a conversation about the things two friends have missed in life, shake hands, and go live our lives again for a year and do it again.\u201d \n\n\nChris, head propped up on his hands, replied \u201cYeah I know, it\u2019s just terrible this loneliness, this inaction. Escaping behind a wry laugh.\u201d\n \n\n\u201cContrary to popular belief, you can spend too much time with yourself.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPhh. Of course you can!\u201d Reclining himself James said, \u201cYou need to get out more. Hold on! Quick sip\u2026but we both know it\u2019s not so simple for Noah.\u201d\n\n\n\n# II ----\n\u201cNoah you\u2019re crying,\u201d James softly spoke. Chris leaned his chest across the worn wooden table, \u201cMaybe we should walk for a bit, leave him with his thoughts. The dissonance jsut faded slightly.\u201d \n\n\n\nJames replied tapping lightly on Noah\u2019s sweater clad shirt, \u201cNoah, Chris and I will return we are going on a brief walk.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cOkay. You felt the shimmer. Thank you.\u201d Looking up, a red palette patched his face, whispers of creases played, tugging at his lips. \n\n\n\nAll knew they stood at an edge and only one could take real leaps. \n\n\n\nJames extracted a smooth worn bill from his coat pocket, folded and creased it. \u201cA writer, a poet cannot follow his mind forever. He must welcome the mixing, the fixing, the making, and tears, the moisture you wick away with unconscious effort what you naively call control, and ultimately other minds. He can hardly contain it in the filmy undulating consciousness lit like a lightning storm. When other voices besides Chris, myself, and the girl, the woman you haven\u2019t named, attack lance into your storm, call with your voice, not for us, we\u2019re part of that clarion ring. Call for that which you love they, those, are my, Chris\u2019s and her reasons why. Call for the pain they invite, the embarrassment they levy, the sadness entombed within waiting to burst upon you, the anger smoldering latent, and the suffering, the purest suffering. Call for the elation, the spirit of happiness suffusing it, the joy leaping from particle to particle, the love morphing into a vortex, the compassion\u2019s promise: darkness roaring \u2018neath muted tears of indigo evenings poised to pounce, and light swelling from the belly of the night to recast with splendrous warmth, to evaporate the mists birthed from the maw of night. We, are so blessed to live days again and again, but you, you have the privilege to call dawn and she answers, to resist night and battles. We watch from the audience, talk with you, conversate to strengthen you, to be with you. Yet, we are also you. Laugh! Smile! But it\u2019s true! Call for the things you love, then for the strength to bring them into being again for that is why you live Noah, that is your reason why, to bring that which and those whom you love with you, and dance with them, lit by the fire you called, which they call too. In the darkness, at night, in pain, anxious, call for the things and those you love and dance with them in a field of lightning or under the weightless sublime stars if it\u2019s clear, or on the plane of consciousness if you can no longer dance in the physical world like me.\u201d \n\n\n\n\nTears danced down Noah\u2019s cheeks as he slipped his fingers on either side of the bill. He\u2019d spent a while in this particular coffee shop.\n\n \n\nNodding, Chris spoke, \u201cWe do only live to sound our soul in the face of the void. The void can do nothing, for it is nothing. Nothing is what threatens to devour us. It only envelopes when we stop singing.\u201d Standing to leave Chris let onto the thing he\u2019d placed into his lap hours ago: a notebook, one of those moleskins scuffed, crinkled and battered. \u201cYou\u2019ll see the writing, the wisdom when you need it. The pages are blank, but I filled almost every page. James squiggled some lines in sideways, literally, shameless, and the beautiful woman, soft she is, lithe, a great dancer, wove the final pages.\u201d \n\n\n\nRotating slightly, oriented to the exit, \u201cThe first words are visible now. Goodbye Noah, or, since we all hate goodbyes\u2026\u201d trailing off\u2026\n\n\n\nChris\u2019s eyes, his angled, proportional features, a mirror nearly to Noah; he\u2019d aged differently though. Many years wore on Chris. \n\n\n\nA tear? From Chris?\n\n\n\nThe hesitation before speech flees from grief,\u201d\u2026since we hate goodbyes\u2026until\u2026\u201d more firmly, \u201cSince goodbye tracks to finality, and this is as final as evening to dawn, as clouds obscuring the sun\u2019s reflection, [as the sun] behind night\u2019s veil, I say go forth. I will ride behind you at the brink of consciousness, at the instance of reflection in a mirror.\u201d\n\n\n\nNoah responded shakily, \u201cGood-bye, or should I say see you again, for that\u2019s how it always has been. Always will be. Thank you too. You, both you and James, and the girl too.\u201d\n\n\n\nChris maneuvered deftly tween the chairs, tables and patrons. Always careful not to interrupt the other conversations taking place here. At the door his eyes drove into Noah\u2019s: recognition, surprise and the colors brightened. He vanished behind the frosted glass door. \n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nicer isn\u2019t it?,\u201d James\u2019s voice turned and swept, fingers of a violinist, the smooth strong motions of his elbow, \u201cChris is a good man.\u201d\n\n\n\nNoah pulled the bill as James\u2019s fingers released it. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cYou asked for the secret to find it hums in the air around you,\u201d James laughed. \u201cThe void Chris painted grows small as lights glow together course, as the lights within coalesced.\u201d Patting Noah on the shoulder, James directed his eyes into Noah\u2019s, \u201cA word of caution, and a  word of hope: light consumes too, and the things you love will conceive a hell within them, within you. Calling for darkness, for nothing is foolish. Feeding the overwhelming light into your void will balance you and grant you the calm to walk again in light instead of running to caves ti seek shelter from the burn of radiance, of coruscating brilliance. That\u2019s where you sit now.\u201d Call for the things you love and bring them into being. What is uncertainty, fear and anxiety but the ghost of the things you love if they die haunting you for failing to bring them to life again. Weave them too into your void for the calm to bring the things you love into being, not alive, for they are always alive within you, you love them, into be-ing.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI must leave you now.\u201d James rose, scraped his chair into place. \u201cYou will do most of the talking next time, to us and our lovely guest. She\u2019s as a live as the things you love. You decided to love those things by the way, that way you know you, *you*, love them.\u201d\n\n\n\nBefore walking away James asked Noah, \u201cDo you want to leave?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to leave more than anything in the world.\u201d Tears again, Noah\u2019s voice laced with a torrent only contained by that shaking whisper. \n\n\n\nJames, smiling full on, began walking. Calling back over every conversation with every intent of interruption, \u201cGood! I edited that damn book too, didn\u2019t say a thing. I\u2019ll chase after Chris.\u201d\n\n\n\nOpening and half-closing the door, he\u2019d all but left, his hand hanging on to the door knob. He swung his head back, calling with a ringing voice:\n\n\n\n\u201cBring those damn things you love into being again and a-fucking-gain/ That\u2019s why creation is the \u2018sublime\u2019, \u2018essence of life\u2019 because it\u2019s all we can do against the darkness.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cGo! Or, really, come on out here!\u201d\n\n\n\nWith that James too vanished, but leaving the door ajar. An invitation to go. \n\n\n\nSore, exhausted really, his limbs could have creaked Noah thought, he rose. Walking to the register he tossed his coffee cup into an eager trashcan. \n\n\n\nBoy, the colors are brighter.\n\n\n\nNoah handed the cashier the bill. A nod and a smile; A handshake, firm and confirming. \n\n\n\n[Like the notebook, the bill was blank, yet to be read.]\n\n\n\n\u201cYou are free to go. This is the exact amount.\u201d \n\n\n\nNoah smiled, music swelled in his heart, colors danced  on the edges of things they coated, for colors are light too. We do walk in a field of light Noah wryly observed. He slipped over to the door and extended his arm, vanishing behind the frosted glass door. \n\n\n\nNoah lived.\n\n\n\nTo bring the things he loved into being again. The void shuddered.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am rising\u201d",

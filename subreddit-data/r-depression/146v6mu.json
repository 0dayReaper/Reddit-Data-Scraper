    "postText": "(vent) i went through a really hard breakup in january, a week before my birthday. (2+ years) and a week later he already started messing around with a new girl (who is a really bad influence on him.) i had to move back to my toxic home environment, and i got a new job that pays kind of well, but i am just so alone. i don\u2019t have a lot of friends anymore and the only reason i keep going is because of my mom. i dont feel like my dad &amp; stepmom really care about me and they don\u2019t treat me very well. i\u2019m thinking about going to college just to give me some sort of purpose in life and to escape my \u201chome\u201d. i don\u2019t feel like i belong anywhere, i feel unlikeable, and i just feel really lost. i dont know what to do anymore.",

Its also a good place to try and make some friends, date and get out of the house. If I were you, I would keep the job and do both (if possible).\n\nSorry about the breakup. That shit takes time. But he's not in your life anymore, so if he wants to be with a bad influence, let it be, right?",

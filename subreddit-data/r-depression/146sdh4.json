    "postText": "I am in a difficult period in my life and family and finances are a really big struggle. I've never had a good relationship with my family as they are very traditional South Asian parents. Whenever I come down mentally though, I fear they feel like they can't let me be independent even more and need to hold onto me. \n\nI just recently had a couple job interviews, another one coming up and I'm hoping to hear back soon. However, I am really stuck in my life and am scared that if I don't take action, I might do something horrible. I need to really change who I am and where I am in life and I feel like if I go to the psych, at least it gives me the isolation and time from OTHER factors to get myself started and figuring my own shit out. \n\nI desperately need these jobs as they will fund my apartment starting this upcoming Fall semester. I'm confident on hearing back from them soon so what should I do? I want to be able to start working when I'm not feeling mentally in a rut but feel worried about losing these opportunities so I need to not go.",

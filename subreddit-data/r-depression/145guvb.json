I will never be good or great, I'm not even sure that I'm average. I'm simply wasting time and not getting anything achieved. I'm a burden to my family and friends. I didn't get anything done for the last few weeks and I feel like I don't deserve anything. This weekend too I have plans to go out with a old friend, but I can't help but feel like I don't deserve to be there, my existnece is just going to a burden to my friend.   ",

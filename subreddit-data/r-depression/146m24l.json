    "postText": "Disappeared boyfriend update (max if you see this please reach out)\n\nI recently posted about how my boyfriend just disappeared off instagram, when you would go into his profile it said \u201cuser nit found\u201d well now his whole account is gone. It\u2019s now instagram user. I\u2019m hurt and I\u2019m so much pain. I have no idea why he would do this . How can someone make another person who already has so much issues, bpd, abandonment issues and get them to open up and disappear. I\u2019m alone again. I\u2019m pain again and it sucks",

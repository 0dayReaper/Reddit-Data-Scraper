    "postText": "Please excuse my english it\u2019s not my first language\n\nMy mom passed away a month ago and I just have so many questions.\n\nShe was a very loving person and many many people cried at her funeral but had 1 flaw, Alcoholism. \n\nMy parents never abused me.\n\nMy parents owned a restaurant( more like a diner??) in Korea and they had more than 1 bottle of soju pretty everyday for my entire childhood (for what I can remember when I was 9 or smth) after their day was done. Sometimes they drank alone and sometimes with their friends. I think she also had depression when I was 9 or smth too.\n\nWe lived in attached rooms next to the restaurant and they fought a lot. Thesedays I think it made me anxious and build complexes cuz it was a fine neighborhood. I went to my friends house to play a lot but I barely invited friends. When I walk back home from school with my friends I used to walk away from them and stuff cuz I was scared they would find out I live there. \n\nSo until I left my parents when I was grade 11 they drank everyday and there were instances I had to call for help from their friends or police(I can only recall like 3 times?)\n\nIn grade 10 and 11, cycling became my hobby and I biked a lot after school and \u201cafter school tutorings\u201d(can\u2019t think of a better way to say). I guess I wanted to run away. And after I\u2019m done grad 11, I tell my parents I want to study abroad. I wanted to run away. My mom begged me to not go cuz partly because she didn\u2019t have enough money saved up and mainly because she couldn\u2019t let me go since she loved me so much. \n\nThey got money from my grandparents cuz they have some money. Anyways I get there and I study pretty well and I end up attending the best school in the country for the major(math lol) I visit them every year (sometimes for 4 months during summer) They don\u2019t fight anymore as they find religion and get old. However they still drink alcohol.\n\nIn 2020, covid comes, and I find  girlfriend there, and live with her In 2020 fall, my mom\u2019s alcoholism gets bad and she gets sent to some kind of hospital cuz she drinks too much. She repeated getting out and getting into hospital for couple years but I never went to see her until this year feb blaming covid, job, and permanent residency. (I guess I was kind of depressed too I blamed myself and cried)\n\nWhen I went to see her this year she was sober for 4 months but she was clearly depressed. She NEVER walked out of that got damn fucking building except when she was going out to see a doctor.  I held hand with her when I sleep and try to tell her everyone love her and thankful for what she\u2019s done to people. She seemed fine. We called every 2 3 days and she seemed alright. I go back to the country for work. Then the third day of May my poor dad calls me she passed away. \n\n\n\n\nI know I\u2019m the reason for her depression and I could\u2019ve saved her if I just called it and went back to my country. Do you guys think it\u2019d be legit if I just follow her?  I will be guilty for my whole fucking life and I feel so sorry for her for brothers and sisters cuz I made them lose their youngest sister. I think about her every moment and she was the most giving person to fucking everyone.",

She loved you dearly and she would want that for you I am 100% sure.\n\nGoing forward, be a good child, find your purpose in life, be happy. Try to be the best you and maybe there will be dark days but such is the way of life. \nI wish you all the best",

And I'm the reason my mom thinks moving abroad is the devil \n\nYour life is yours and people's perspectives are theirs. You mentioned how loving your mom was. I don't see a loving mom holding her child guilty for her depression.\n\nThe only wrong thing you did towards your mom is blaming yourself for doing something ill against her. I don't think she'd like that as a loving mom.",

And when it gets too bad, it sure doesn\u2019t end well. Your mother provided the best she could, and you did whatever\u2019s best for her. \n\nShe is up there, watching over you, don\u2019t be sad and make her sad. Be happy, move on and create a good life and break the generational curses brother, don\u2019t turn into another depressed parent, rather try your best providing.",

Sure there's a chance that ad you gone back and stayed a while she's still be alive; but from what I see here, you'd both be depressed.   \n\nFrankly it sounds like she ALSO wanted a way out of the situation, but was bound by love or social expectations to stay. \n\nShe might have gone from sounding depressed to putting on the mask to cover that up.  I do that myself, and it's pretty common among those of us with depression as a coping mechanism. we dont want to bring down those around us, nor do we want to be asked about how we feel - when we know we have to lie about it. \n\nPlease - be kind to yourself.  You did not cause your mother's death. She loved you. She would want you to find some happiness.  And it's going to take time to internally deal with your loss.  See if you have anyone in your circle who's lost a parent to talk about it.  or hire a counciler so you can.  Bottling it up isnt going to help.",

Well-put. \n\nMy thoughts on Broken \u2014 We have to fight in this life, for what we believe in and also for our values. If we become depressed we lose our ability to fight and things slowly pile up. Nothing good comes from fleeing life. Fleeing makes the whys leave and causes the hows to become even heavier. I\u2019m trying to face fear and walk towards it again \u2014 to \u201cwalk towards Mordor\u201d \u2014 but it\u2019s a hard turn around for me, too. \n\nSpeaking of Mordor\u2026 Frodo was broken but came back together because of fellowship. Other people. Not just himself. So he (1) walked towards fear and (2) did so with others. \n\nThose are probably our two tasks.",

(Per Jung, 7 marks the beginning of consciousness.) A thing that could see both the great wonders of this beautiful world but also the great terrors and unjust perpetuities. That could see the sun piercing wisps of cloud, when in awe of the sky,  but could also see airplanes piercing buildings. \n\nMaybe depressives are unwilling participants in life, so consciousness brings terror, because we find ourselves in a room from which there is simply no key. (Unless one chooses death, as many do, but that isn\u2019t a key but is instead an abrogation.)\n\nAlas. \n\nPS \u2014 this subreddit is really depressing for some reason! \ud83e\udd14\n\nPSS \u2014 in all seriousness, I think anyone who thinks and feels deeply will question at some point whether they can bear the weight of it all. And I think more people are suffering than we all think, living lives of weary desperation, connected to one another only to the extent that their fear keeps them disconnected.",

Everyone has at least one dark night, and many have multiple dark nights, and the lack of a dark night isn\u2019t a sign of psychological health but instead is often a sign of a human who is still enchanted by status, money, power, or some other hollow goal. \n\nYour depression is speaking to you. Listen to it. What\u2019s it saying? Just be quiet and listen, because \u201cyou\u201d \u2014 ego \u2014 are going to try to talk it down out of fear of growth.

I always had dark under eyes from bad nights. \n\nMy first memory is waking up from a nightmare (ants in my bed) and crying for mom, and she came yelling at me to shut up and go back to bed. She was so, so mad. I never slept well since.\n\nWhen I was about 9 and had bad pneumonia that I thought was gonna kill me that night, (my folks were a doc and a nurse so never took us to a hospital),,, I told mom \"I love you\" when she was walking away, and she just looked at me then walked away.\n\nSo yeah, I've never been a happy kid. But I want to be happy now, and I'm trying to get into psychotherapy. I've forgiven mom after learning how difficult it was for her with a cheating husband and forced births back to back. I still hold some grudges against my siblings though but I'm about to buy mom's house and eventually they'll be history too lol.\n\nJust to clarify, I and my family are now living with mom in her house, she's dying so I'm helping her as much as I can, and my husband and I will buy her house soon so she can live the rest of her life not having to worry about the house or the bills or anything. She's happy and we all get along. It's just my siblings that are sometimes bothersome.",

Before that we lives with my grandparents from the time my sibling was born. When we moved my mom had less help so I became more responsible for things like chores, helping with taxes, watching my sibling and writing notes to give to the court to show how unfit my father was to be a parent and how he doesn't help pay for us. I still did a lot of children's activities but this is when the weight of the world started sitting on my shoulders. \n\nAside from the weight at home I was bullied by everyone at the schools I attended for my weight, the color of my skin, what my mom packed for lunch or what i purchased from the lunch counter when i was anle to afford it. I was also ghosted by the friends I made prior to moving, and when we moved back to the city I grew up in originally, they wanted nothing to do with me still. \n\nTo this day I don't have any real friends I can say I trust or that actually care about me. My father is still a deadbeat and sold me a bad car so i owe him money and still have to fix this car with problems. I still have to care for a lot of my moms responsibilities. I am a mother now and  feel I am failing my child because I am not strong or confident in what I do. \n\nI just want the hope back that I can do anything I want to do. The confidence to be in the spotlight. The ability to trust others won't hurt me like my parents did. \n\nMy advice: read \"Not Nice: *stop people pleasing, staying silent, &amp; feeling guilty... and start speaking up, saying no, asking boldly, and unapologetically being yourself",

            "comment": "I struggled with depression for 20 years. But then 3 years, ago, all of sudden and for no reasonat all. (Well.........maybe there were a few reasons) My depression lifted. I'm so happy!!! I'm like a little kid again. Everyday I thank the universe  that my depression is gone. I'm a lifelong, staunch atheist so I don't thank god or call it a miracle. But if I was a believer..........I would definitely call it a miracle.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen only thing I can say is that I joined AA because I had a drinking problem. I don't agree with a lot of what AA teaches. But they do teach that resentments keep us sick. There's a saying that holding a resentment against people is like drink poisionn a expecting the other person to die. It wasn't until I let go of my resentment that truly felt better. It was like a weight lifted off my shoulders. Now, I have absolutely no resentments. Someone does something that would usually set me off.............now it doesn't bother me. Or if it does, it just bothers me a little and then I let it go. Also, AA teaches that you should only worry about stuff you can control. If I can't control it, It's not worth worrying about. I'm severely disabled and when I was depressed I used to worry about all the stuff I can't do. But now that stuff doesn't bother me because I'm not God and I have no control over how my disability affects me.\n\nThen only thing I can say is that I joined AA because I had a drinking problem.

I\u2019ve always had trouble paying attention due to ADHD and other problems, runs in the family. Ever since I\u2019ve been in online it\u2019s impossible for me to focus so I always play games instead of class all day, I try to stop it but I don\u2019t have the willpower for it. I have no friends so I find no reason to go outside and I try to get back into working out but I can\u2019t get back into it. \nI\u2019ve dealt with bullying before but now that I\u2019m more self aware I\u2019ve realized that the situation is pretty shitty. I try to get into better habits like remembering to shower every day and brush my teeth but I can\u2019t even do that either, due to all this I am worried I\u2019m falling into a state of depression all over again and I\u2019m scared of that because I\u2019ve already had two suicide attempts before.",

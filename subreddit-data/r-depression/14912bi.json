    "postText": "A few months ago someone noticed me ranting on here and started talking to me, but it soon became apparent that he was hurting too, but now I'm genuinely concerned for him.\n\nI'm not concerned that he'll kill himself, he said that the idea doesn't comfort him, I'm concerned if he'll be able to live happy, because he said that I should \"join in on destroying him\" I would never do that and he thinks he deserves it and is a waste of space. I want to help him but I can't. I'm merely a teen while he's a grown adult across the world.",

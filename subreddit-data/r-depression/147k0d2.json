    "postText": "Yesterday I was in complete crisis. I chatted with the suicide hotline, which didn't help. Also first time doing it. I finally ate something and went to sleep. I did so some self harm to take the 'edge' off. \n\nBut now I woke up and I feel nothing is better. My situation isn't better. I'm still lonely. I'm still not welcome. If I die my friends still won't care. I don't know how to start my day.\nI cancelled my drivers lesson, because I just couldn't see myself driving a car today. I might visit my sister, but I can't pretend I'm fine. I don't want to tell her I wanted to kill myself last night. I cannot burden people with it. \nMy house is a mess, but cleaning once again seems so futile. Nobody is coming here. Nobody will visit me ever. Noone will text me to see where I went.\n\nWhat the fuck do I do. I officially have no reason anymore to be here.",

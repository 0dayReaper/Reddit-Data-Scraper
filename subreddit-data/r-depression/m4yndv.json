I thought my future was good and all I cared about was playing with friends and climbing trees. How things have changed\n\nEdit: I genuinely didn't expect so many kind comments even on a sub like this. I feel better and I have you all to thank for that.",

Some of us were best friends from the age of 3 all the way to college but we have now all gone our separate ways. I mean I cherish the memories with my friends and will forever be grateful but nostalgia hurts. Stay strong friend. Here if you need to talk. Sending good vibes your way.",

It's not that it was better then, rather it clarifies how I became such a miserable wreck, and I start to judge myself for being alive in the first place.",

I don\u2019t have any kids yet but is it bad that if I had high school age kids, I would let them go to parties and would let my daughter be a cheerleader and dress \u201cprovocatively\u201d and would want them to focus on being social and having a good time? (Plus schoolwork?) My parents were so strict and I was a dork and majorly depressed in high school. It was such a stressful time for me. I never had a boyfriend in high school, mostly because I thought I was ugly and unworthy of love. All I cared about were my grades and SAT score. Now that I\u2019m older I feel like all my hard work then didn\u2019t even pay off or reward me in the long run. I guess you\u2019re supposed to push your kids to succeed so they can get into a good college and land a well paying job. I went to a good college but now that I live in the real world, I realize employers care more about experience and your skillset rather than where you went to school. And even if you\u2019re lucky enough to have a job where you make good money, adulthood sucks all the way around. You have bills to pay and have to work to eat. The majority of your life will be spent chained to a desk working for a corporation that gives zero fucks about you. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn\u2019t worry and stress out so much over academics because I feel like I missed out on a lot of other things.",

Being forced to move on and being plagued by nostalgia just rips me apart. When asked if having a bad childhood was why I was depressed I have to correct people and say in fact no I had a perfect one-and that's the problem. Things were so good before-I never wanted to let go. \n\nNothing is ever as good as it once was and it seems to steadily be getting worse and worse and it breaks my heart. I hate seeing what I loved die, I hate losing everything I once treasured evaporate before my eyes, and I hate even more people saying things can and will get better. Because no...things may not stay horrific, and good times come I am sure, but my problem is-I liked what I had I didn't want this new stuff. It's not the same. I am not happy with it I am settling because its what's here. Nostalgia, though, constantly reminds me of what I had and I can't help but compare then and now and it makes the depression worse.",

You can ask someone to go with you, or just go by yourself, climb a tree, sit on a branch and enjoy the feeling. Unless there's pandemic restrictions, then there might be nothing stopping you. You can even call a friend while you're up there. Something my girfriend told me just an hour ago is that you're friends are just as far for you to reach out to as you are to them. So grab a phone and call someone, ask how they are, and just catch up.   \nDamn, I'll go climb a tree and think of you tomorrow when it's not 1:18am :D",

I guess that's what years of isolation does for you.\n\nIf anything anyone whoever tells me not to commit suicide, because it would hurt anyone I know is selfish, because why would anyone want to continue living a miserable existence that they have no control over?\n\nAnd the worst part is you have these imbeciles who come in sprouting off their nonsense saying that \"We\" have the power to change our lives. \"We\" have control of our lives. It's not relatively true in the slightest. It's just more bullshit that many people say to those with depression, so they can feel good about themselves about trying to \"help\" someone, when in reality it isn't worth a shit.\n\nThere are many things we cannot control in our lives, and guess what? Depression is one of those exact things that it is impossible to actually control, because depression is the after effect of years of pain, suffering, and loneliness.\n\nIt's like when people bring that whole \"Just be positive\" bullshit. How the fuck can you actually be positive, when there is nothing to fucking be positive about?",

I kept thinking people kept telling me to have control over my life, when in reality, they were telling me to try and focus on what I can do to change my situation. Unless you are locked in a prison, it's actually relatively simple to do. If your life isn't good where you are, go somewhere where life is better. I find that makes all the difference in the world.

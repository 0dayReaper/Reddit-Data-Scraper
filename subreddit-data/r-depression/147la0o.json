    "postText": "I\u2019ve been dealing with depression since 2011, have been on some form of medication since 2016. (Prozac had a horrible reaction, then Zoloft until my suicidal period in 2018) now I\u2019m on 40mg of Celxa.\n\nI\u2019m in therapy and deal with anxiety/panic disorder and emetaphobia. \n\nRecently I\u2019ve been feeling worse. (I\u2019m a a sub teacher, and I\u2019m on summer break). I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just due to circumstances right now: my grandmom (mom\u2019s side) who I was close with died Dec 2022, my papa( dad\u2019s side)died in April, which has led to a lot of infighting with family. I\u2019ve had some personal stress with trying to earn my teaching certification, had emergency hand surgery in Jan. Then my dad was hospitalized for 4 days 3 weeks ago. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m just overwhelmed right now or not. My psychiatrist feels like I haven\u2019t allowed myself to grieve the losses of my grandparents.\n\nMy dad mentioned to me last night that I may need to adjust my medication.\n\nI\u2019m so scared to go up on my dosage (I also take Buspar 30mg for anxiety). I don\u2019t want to go completely indifferent to the world and I\u2019m scared of negative reactions. Medication of any kind has always scared me.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I should try going up on my dosage or if this is just a tough time I can work through with my therapist",

            "comment": "Hi OP. Firstly, I\u2019m sorry to hear you\u2019re having a hard time. I am kind of in the same boat right now and wondering if I should also up my dose (have been on 20mg Prozac for over a year but I still struggle to do things like eat well, go outside, exercise etc). \n\nIt sounds like you have a lot going on right now and what you described would be overwhelming for anyone. Are you currently in therapy? Having someone to talk these things through / work through it with would probably alleviate some of this stress and lend you some support.\n\nSending strength.",

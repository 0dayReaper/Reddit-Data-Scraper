Depression and feeling hopeless. I also want to die, but could never do that. I have a family. I have a sweet young boy that loves me and I love my family to death, but escaping this pain feels impossible and therapy isn\u2019t doing shit. The loneliness is the worst. I don\u2019t feel anyone understands. \n\nSending you a big warm hug and a hot cup of hot chocolate and something to take the edge off. May you find peace and joy. May you be happy. May you be healthy, May you find the healing you deserve!",

A lot of the bad thought patterns that perpetuate depression can be changed so you can start wanting to take care of yourself. If you haven't tried medication I recommend doing it for a few months to see if it makes a difference but I'm sure you're aware of that option.  You have to want to want help, but it's so hard when you feel worthless :(",

Hold on to the hope! My life\u2019s been garbage for so long and bc I stuck w it it\u2019s starting to turn around (career wise) I still have barely 2 friends, 2 insane irresponsible parents who prob need my help, and not even one date in the last year. I\u2019m still optimistic I\u2019m fat as hell too, a broken ankle. Ngl it\u2019s the dumb bs that keeps me from ending it all what\u2019s really makes me happier day to day. I\u2019m sure that will run out but I can always count on a marvel, fast furious movie, maybe the new season of black mirror to keep me from ending it all. In a really dark time in my life it was Nicholas Cage\u2019s performance in Bad Lieutenant: Port of New Orleans that really made me keep going. I play a lot of NBA2k sometimes guys are funny, also recently got into Deep House Sets, Kaytranada, Ambient D&amp;B mixes. Doesn\u2019t fix what is a broken life but it does keep it Elmer glued together. Praise Allah, or not, life\u2019s a beach, but that beach sometimes sucks you off.

Everyone experiences low points in their lives, it's quite common to have negative feelings and bad days.\n\nI'm glad you are aware that you don't actually want to die. Not wanting to live through an emotion or feeling is different from not wanting to live.\n\nJust because you may feel this way now, doesn't mean you will always feel this way. There would be no happiness without having lows. Lows are temporary if you wait and see the highs.\n\n\rYou may have seen this as not having the courage to go through with suicide. However, I see it as someone having a lot of courage to process those negative emotions.",

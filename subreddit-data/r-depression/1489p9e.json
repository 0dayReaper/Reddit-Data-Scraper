    "postText": "idk I\u2019m here thinking ab life and it really fucking sucks. I just feel so empty. no matter what I do I can\u2019t get out of my own head. there\u2019s always this nagging feeling in the back of my mind like something is literally gnawing at the inside my head trying to escape. I\u2019ll have moments when I feel semi-okay and then everything just crumbles again. I feel like a freak. I can\u2019t talk about it with anyone. I have friends but we don\u2019t ever really talk ab anything important, even though most of them are aware I\u2019m depressed af. no one checks in, no one cares. If I disappeared would anyone even notice? Inside my head I feel like I\u2019m constantly screaming at the top of my lungs but no one can hear me. so here I am yelling into this void instead. I guess it also doesn\u2019t help that I can\u2019t really put my feelings into words. I just feel like shit. there\u2019s not really a particular emotions I\u2019m feeling it really feels like nothing but everything at the same time. I feel like it will never end, just an endless string of sleepless nights and unshed tears. I wish I could sleep but I can\u2019t. I wish I could cry but I can\u2019t. I wish I felt better but I don\u2019t. I need to go back to the doctor and get back on my meds but I\u2019m too fucking scared. I\u2019m also too scared to try therapy. There are so many things that have happened in my life that got me to this point and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to unpack all of that. So I guess I\u2019ll do what I always do and bottle it up. It will explode one day and maybe then someone will listen to me.",

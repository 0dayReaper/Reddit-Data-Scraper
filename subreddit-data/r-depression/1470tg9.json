    "postText": "I used to have the kind of depression where you feel hopeless and want to harm yourself. I don't have that anymore. Instead, I've developed a situation where I don't feel super sad, but my depression has manifested in a different way that's about to cost me everything. I lost the ability to do anything. I'm like a sack of potatoes, frozen in place. I can't move, I can't take care of myself or my surroundings. It can take me an hour just to get out of bed to use the bathroom. My skin is infected from not being able to shower, my food has to be delivered, my clothes are dirty from not being able to wash them, and my apartment looks like an episode of Hoarders (I don't hoard, I just don't have the energy or ability to clean it).\n\nI'm moving to a tiny tiny tiny studio that will be easier to take care of, but I can't fix the apartment I'm currently in. I have to leave everything behind, my belongings and the mess. My landlord is going to no doubt sue me for whatever thousands of dollars it will cost to dispose of my belongings and clean it. I don't have a way to pay them for it. I leave in a few days and I'm panicking. I want to get up and just throw everything away; it's a small apartment. It wouldn't be  hard for a normal person. But I've been sitting here for weeks begging myself to get up and do it. But I'm frozen with limbs made of concrete that won't listen to me. This is going to cost me everything and I don't know what to do.",

I'm not there yet myself, I don't have a purpose and my life doesn't have meaning, at least not to me...but I know that when I'm more mentally healthy, I can decide my own purpose and give my own life meaning.\n\nMotivation is a tough one. It took me a month between deciding I needed to go on walks to help my mental health and actually going outside to go on one. I had zero motivation and now that I actually did take that walk, I have zero motivation to go on another one. I'll just have to do it anyway. The motivation seems to come afterwards, sadly, so you'll have to somehow spend energy to do things that you don't really think you have.\n\nFinally, positivity. That too is a choice, according to my therapist. If you're anything like me you've got all these bad thoughts in your head, saying you're not good enough, or you're going to die alone, or why even try if you're always gonna fail anyway? The thing is, there are also good thoughts in your head. You *know* deep down you're good enough, that you also deserve love like everyone else, that you won't always fail and even if you do, it's okay. You know these things, but the negative thoughts are drowning out the positive ones. You need to actively identify and seek out positive thoughts about yourself. They're there, you just need to listen and actually trust that they have every bit as much reason to exist as all of the bad thoughts.\n\nAsking for help is a big step! I hope this helps at least a little. Keep fighting!",

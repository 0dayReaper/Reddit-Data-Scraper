    "postText": "Im trying to be anonymous, but I need help. Im not rich and my financial stability it\u2019s limited so I don\u2019t have money for insurance and I can\u2019t afford a psychologist or therapy but I want to know if what im experiencing is depression, anxiety or it\u2019s just hormones. \n\nThis is been going on for years but I feel every year is getting worse. I have trouble sleeping like there is some days I can\u2019t go to sleep because my brain thinks and over things a lot or I just can\u2019t sleep. Some days I can\u2019t sleep by the constant fear of dying in my sleep.\n\nI can\u2019t talk to people face to face I can\u2019t even look at them in their eyes. Only people I\u2019m close with I can. When I talk to strangers I feel like their are judging me by appearance or imperfections or my accent. When I have to talk over the fun with managers or stores I tend to sweat a lot and I feel colds and some extent I even shake. Etc.\n\nRandom hours of the days but specially at nights sadness just comes out of nowhere. I feel helpless I feel like my life I trash but at the same time my life is not trash. I hate meeting people with everything that I want and see them they are happy. Sometimes I been spacing out and tears just come our and I some times don\u2019t understand why I\u2019m feeling sad. Another things I feel sad is my appearance I feel like I\u2019m not a good looking and no one likes me and that\u2019s why I have spend all of my teenager years and most of 20s single. Never dated in my life. Is it because I\u2019m ugly? Idk. I hate my life but at the same time I don\u2019t hate it and I shouldn\u2019t hate it. At nights when I feel hopeless and sad all of my memories of past mistakes show up and I feel more sadder. My minds is constant thinking of the future to prepare me for the mistakes I\u2019m going to make. I don\u2019t see no success in my life and the fact that all my siblings and family and friends are living a good like and succeeding in life is making me feel like I\u2019m left behind. I don\u2019t have friends and watchinf all my coworkers that I have work for years are beinf best friends with the new people and never talked to me in a friendly way.  I like to be in my room by myself but at the same time I hate it cuz it\u2019s when I feel sadder. I have a constant fear for danger and my mind doesn\u2019t stop thinking of every dangerous situation I could be and it makes me more afraid to do things. I also have a constant fear of dying and anytime I do something my mind doesn\u2019t stop thinking of all the possible ways I can die In the moment. I hate my life but I love living and I\u2019ll never will think myself of kms. I don\u2019t have no one but my mind but my biggest villain it\u2019s my mind. I have short memory some days my min doesn\u2019t want to even remember things and to me it was normal to not remember anything from childhood because I can\u2019t remember not so much for my childhood I have some blurry memories but not a lot. \n\nAnd many more things but this is all I remember \n\n\n\nI don\u2019t think what to do. I wanna think that it\u2019s just because I\u2019m single I\u2019m feeling like this and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s love or how to give love or I have something. I\u2019m serious pls help",

            "comment": "100% you have mental health stuff going on. It\u2019s not normal to stay awake because you\u2019re scared of dying in your sleep. I listen to specific type of asmr to help me sleep and it\u2019s basically the only thing that allows my brain to shut up. There is info out there on things you can try to help you sleep besides medication. I think it\u2019s worth at least looking up what suggestions are out there if it\u2019s so bad.\n\nThe things you said about talking to others, even sweating and shaking with calls.. it\u2019s not normal either. It sounds quite severe.\n\nOp..\n\u201cand watchinf all my coworkers that I have work for years are beinf best friends with the new people and never talked to me in a friendly way.\u201d\n\nThat shit broke my heart. No one deserves to feel this way.\n\nBut yet you honestly surprise me by still saying \u201cI love living and I\u2019ll never think of Kms\u201d. I\u2019m not very optimistic and don\u2019t usually feel things from someone saying this but considering how much you\u2019re going through, all on your own, it felt really good to see you say that.\n\nBut yes. You have mental health stuff going on. Depression probably, anxiety it seems, and maybe more with the sleeping and perhaps other things. I hope you will be able to find help because you deserve to have support to help you get through this and figure things out. Stay strong.",

            "comment": "i don't want to lie and say i know exactly how you feel but i will say that i share a lot of those struggles which can be so hard. i think that what helps me get a little relief when i'm stuck between hating life and thinking i shouldn't is sometimes allowing myself to feel those emotions and then still trying to keep them in check and not hate life for the little reasons. that feeling of having your mind be your worst enemy is so tough i have the same thing sometimes and with an anxious mind like that staying active and occupied can be a good way to prevent those thoughts coming up, staying active can help put your focus on something other than your mind or your sadness. i know my words mean almost nothing coming from another anonymous user but hang in there, i'm sending good energy so you got this",

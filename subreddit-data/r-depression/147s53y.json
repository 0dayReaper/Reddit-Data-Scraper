    "postText": "For context I have major depressive disorder amongst many others (OCD, anxiety, binge eating, excoriation, HSP) I work for a non profit and I love my job and find great fulfillment but I\u2019m so depressed and burnt out I just want to sleep. All day. Every day. It\u2019s never enough sleep. I\u2019m tired of being strong. I\u2019m tired of not getting a break. I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m tired of people pleasing and being run dry. I\u2019m Tired of only being called when someone needs something. I\u2019m in therapy and meds and working on setting boundaries but my issue is- how the fuck do I get out of bed and work and do the things I need to do when nothing seems worth it? I have no desire to do anything except be alone and sleep. I have a plan everyday to tackle my work tasks and somehow every day it\u2019s pulling teeth to get me out of bed and I can\u2019t focus",

            "comment": "Hello, I want to start my reply to your post by pointing out that I am very impressed by your ability to fight back the mental suffering you are currently experiencing. You are trying so very hard with therapy, medication, working on your ability to build boundaries, and even making work plans everyday! That's fantastic! You should be proud of yourself for putting up such a fight! I hope the following questions help you. What do you want out of life? What makes you happy or at least content with your day? Maybe things will start to improve if you think about what you like and what you find happiness in! Then, continue from there! I, for example look forward everyday to playing with my cats and watching anime. Don't give up, you can do it. Always remember, reddit will be around whenever you need a random stranger to tell you that you are doing a great job and that everything will be okay!",

Maybe I can give suggestions (I watch a ton lol) and that can give you a headstart towards doing things that you like to do for yourself! Maybe starting out with bigger activities you like to do can seem too scary right now, and that's okay! Build up to it I say. For now, things like interacting with your cats and watching anime can be a way to build up towards doing activities like bike riding for example!",

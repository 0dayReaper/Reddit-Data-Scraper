    "postText": "I was sitting with my family 12 of us Me and my cousin were just ribbing each other as we do. I'm 21F and I don't look or talk 21 so I have trouble ordering drinks or feeling like I belong in adult places. Anyways I ordered a drink the same as my mom but mine tasted non alcoholic. The waitress had made a comment about how young i look and was hesitant to give me the drink. It was 14 dollars so I was like why pay 14 bucks 4 a drink that doesn't even have alcohol in it and my cousin made a super valid point that if I was gonna fuss about it I should tell the waitress to get me a new one. Then she went on to mess with me about the fact that I wouldn't. \n\nIn that moment I just broke down I mean I tried to hold my tears at all the facts she was hitting me with but tears started streaming down my face rapidly and they wouldn't stop. I kept trying to hid my face and stop myself from crying. I tried my damndest not to cry in front of people and not ruin a good time. But they saw me crying and I couldn't pull myself together. Once she saw me crying she was apologizing and I could tell she felt bad when in reality she hadn't really done anything wrong. \n\nI hated myself even more in that moment. I was so fucking embarrassed. I'm still embarrassed and it's 3 days later. I am a fucking pussy who can't send something back with a waitress if they get my meal wrong or if they get my drink wrong. I'm super fucking weak and I absolutely hate myself for it. My mom ended up getting my drink fixed and I couldn't even talk for like 5 to ten minutes while I tried to rein in my tears over fucking nothing. The drink was disgusting and still didnt taste or look like the one they made my mom, but i sucked it down as fast as humanly possible and will probably never complain about the drinks i recieve anymore. I hate how emotionally wrecked I am at this stage in my life.",

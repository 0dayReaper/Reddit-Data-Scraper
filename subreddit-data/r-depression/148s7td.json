    "postText": "I have some emotional baggage that comes along with me, despite how desperately I want to get rid of it. I\u2019m not trying to talk too high about myself but at first glance when some guys like my looks they fit me into this persona that I\u2019m definitely not and never tried to be like. For one guy I\u2019m the manic pixie dreamgirl who will give him the confidence and ego boost he needs after he just got out of a relationship. For another I\u2019m literally just my body, he\u2019ll \u201clisten\u201d to my genuine fears and worries but its always as an exchange. Explicit pictures and videos of me for his emotional support. Even when I think \u201cthis time he\u2019ll be different\u201d it always has to end in a sexual way. Maybe I attract these guys myself and am partially to blame as well. But I\u2019m so tired. They either don\u2019t care about me besides my body or they pretend to be nice while having a hidden agenda all the time. I just feel so lonely and don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever have or deserve a genuine relationship where he sees me for me, unconditionally and despite my flaws and without molding me into the role they want me to fulfill in their lives.",

I'm 39 years old and probably lost the best thing that's ever happened to me 3 months ago due to my brain thinking I couldn't love her child. Its been eating me up inside ever since.\n\n I know this doesn't really have much to do with what your issue is but I just wanted to tell you that you are not alone. Someone like me perhaps will find someone like you and love you for exactly who you are. She has issues with depression too and I treated her with love and understanding. I hope someone will do the same for you.",

    "postText": "Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the \"role model\" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.\n\n-----\n\nOur subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.\n\nWe also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the \"depression\" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.\n\nYSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:\n\n- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact\n\n- \"I'm here to help\" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The \"giving help\" wiki explains more about this.\n\n- Role modelling, i.e. \"achievement\" or \"advice\" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that \"internet culture\" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.\n\n- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).\n\n- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The \"what is depression\" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",

You know how Homer chokes out Bart in The Simpsons? I wanted to do that to her, but I didn't. \n\nI'm still angry at how she treated me but also angry at myself for allowing it for as long as I did. It also made me angry to see her treating her new girlfriend better than she did me. I don't understand why I wasn't deserving of basic decency or what I did wrong.\n\nI'm also feeling like a failure as my relationship ended a month ago, and I feel it's my fault. To make matters worse, I found out my ex and a (former) friend were seeing each other, likely while my ex and I were still together. \n\nAs pathetic as this sounds, I can't stop replaying a conversation a friend and I had yesterday. The conversation re-confirmed how I feel about myself, and I'm tempted to end the friendship. The way she spoke to me yesterday is the reason I have a hard time opening up and isolate myself as is.\n\nI feel like a fucking burden to others and all I want to do right now is sleep. I'm feel so fucking defective and broken.",

But I'll share that this time, it's because of a movie lol. \n\nBut I was also reminded about trying to use crisis text line. When I was feeling really low, I tried twice last month and didn't get any response at all, waiting for several hours. Both through text and messenger. I hope whoever was being helped, got the help they needed. But it's just something to think about. How many other people were crying and feeling extreme loneliness? I guess it's a lot, all the time... Also that we aren't alone. It's hard to muster up energy/courage to do anything now. But somehow we are not alone. I might lose the fight because of all my failures, and unwillingness.",

It has been almost 2 years since our last messages (and over 2 since i felt like the friendship wasn't there anymore). \n\nOur one remaining mutual (my only \"friend\" for the past two years, though we barely talk :/) thinks it isn't too late to try and rekindle things. I just think it had deteriorated so much in the span of half a year that i lost all faith i had in my ex best friend. And he has never once asked the mutual to talk to me, or sent a friend request, or emailed or even texted me after we stopped talking. \n\nTo me, it's over for good. But i fucking miss him so much it hurts so bad. He gave me hope and goals for the future - to meet up one day (online friends) and travel the continent together. I can't do it without him. I can't do *this* without him.\n\nAnyway before i make even less sense, [here is my go-to crying song that i feel encompasses my feelings about this situation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzWNnsmFGWI). Discovered it with barely over 100 views and i'm pretty sure all the rest are mine. Bawled my eyes out when i first heard it as i was thinking about him and the lyrics are my thoughts exactly...",

I am in a bathroom in a city I don't know with my father driving to my new job (his insistence that he come for a final goodbye and not mine...I would have preferred to go alone) and I am in shambles\n\nHe decided 6 hours into a 15 hour drive to have an \"adult conversation\" (where he mostly proceeded to demean me and make it about him) regarding my job, my relationships and my personality. To him I am a doormat and I need to toughen up. He told me he wished he could leave when I tried to defend myself, made fun of my anxiety, and said if I disrespected him or threw him under the buss he would never speak to me again. So...i am a doormat for him. But hey...I sucked it up and put on a smile to get us to our location with peace.\n\nI insist on stopping at earlier locations to get a motel or food and he stresses he wants to get to a hotel in our destination and he then proceeded to get mad at me for not stopping for food and not offering a protein bar (this is after I offered to get food for him even at the hotel). To hear \"you have pissed me off\" as I am apologizing and trying to offer food hurts.\n\nI have tried to think of everything, be happy and talkative and there and now...I sit alone in a bathroom I don't know and just feel... Alone and pathetic and like a child. I can't breath and I can't say anything and I just someone to hold me for a little bit.",

I know eventually I have to face a problem, big or small. But what can I do about not wanting to do it \"now?\" \n\nThere's always tomorrow. This is a mindset that I don't have a problem with anymore. Or at least less of a problem. For me, it's something that I really dread, to push a task to tomorrow.\n\n For example, I might need to go to the grocery store, which means I have to get up, get ready, drive there, shop, bag up my stuff, put in the car, drive home, etc. It's a lot of mini-tasks. I can't seem to consolidate these tasks to \"go to the store.\" Which is why I think I tend to push things to later. So far, I have gone to the store out of impulse. But it still has been successful overall. So I shouldn't be too hard on myself if I don't get everything done right away.\n\nBut I don't know. It feels connected to my depression/anxiety about having to go out. But yeah just wanted post.",

He only came back because his gf broke up with him and he was feeling lonely. I guess he found someone new because it's just crickets now. I have no one to cry to about this. This happened so many times already I'm too embarassed. I don't understand how someone could play with a person's feelings this way. It hurts so much. I need to block him. I know. I'm just so damn lonely and miss him. I wish I were just dead lol maybe then he would feel something for me. His indifference makes me want to die.",

            "comment": "It feels like I'm trapped in a rut that I can never escape from. I have severe depression, little connection with any of my friends, take terrible care of my hygiene, and I hate my parents. My parents constantly gaslight me and are terrible human beings who constantly voice out their horrific beliefs that they don't know are basically targeted at me. I feel so much hatred every time I pretend to love them, pretend that I'm happy being near them, pretend I'm happy as they constantly attempt to take the only time that gives me a sliver of what I consider \"happiness\" to be. I constantly sit there and listen as they say that something is wrong with me, or as my mom says she'll force me to a therapist if I don't talk or communicate with a random stranger I've never known. I constantly hate myself and feel like a fake, believing that I'm faking my emotions to get a reaction or attention from others. I feel disgusted every day that I don't brush my teeth or shower, and I feel like a freak every time I hear people talk about how disgusting that behavior is. I feel like a fake when I hear all those posts talk about how it's the people who're happy on the outside that suffer the most. I feel invalidated and feel that nobody will ever take my feelings seriously just because I'm not like that stereotype. Of course, most people around me won't even realize something is wrong unless you clearly say you have depression, and everybody jokes about it, so why would anybody care about me who is OBVIOUSLY just going along with it. I feel like I've spent my entire life researching ways to get better, from why someone might have depression and into the pros and cons of antidepressants. I really don't understand myself. I don't even feel like a human being anymore. How could I possibly be a normal human in a world where people are so focused on goals and happiness and the future? How is everybody planning on a stage of life that I don't even plan on making it to? How is my entire life spent on attempts to understand what's wrong with me while they're all worried about what college they want to go to? I feel even worse knowing that plenty of people in this sub have probably felt this exact way, yet are still alive, with it only being their first step into hell. I've really gone through nothing bad, yet I still sit here and complain about my life, acting like I'm a victim who's actually gone through something.",

It's really freaking discouraging. It's always scary meeting a new therapist, so I am kinda dreading whenever one is available. But I also feel very alone and scared so I want it to happen sooner rather than later.\n\nEverything seems so difficult for some reason and I feel ashamed for it. I'm too depressed to take care of myself most days. I've lost a lot of weight from not eating enough because I'm too depressed to tackle the ordeal of cooking. It's hard to remember to brush my teeth, I probably have cavities. I feel like a worthless lump. The world is hostile and I don't feel like I fit in it anywhere. I'm lost.\n\nI have constant anxiety weighing down on me. It's crushing. So much fear and dread. It's affecting my physical health. I am seeing doctors about the physical stuff, at least. But if the root cause is all the depression and anxiety and other stuff i was diagnosed with, it feels like just a bandaid seeing doctors for the physical symptoms. It feels a little like a waste of effort.\n\nI would feel totally alone if i didn't have my cat. She helps ground me, and if nothing else I can get the will to get up and take care of her. I'm so glad she's here. She keeps me here. She makes me happy. She's the best thing in the world. I want to get better and give her a good long life.\n\nI'm doing my best to hang in there. I'll keep trying. But it hurts and I hope it stops hurting.",

But from the looks of things, you seem to have some form of stability, or at least a roof over your head to lay around under, so it's not the end of the world! (Yet).\n\nYou are down on your luck, It's difficult to get up and face the world, but no one said you had to conquer it in a single day, what you need to do now is take little steps. Stop punishing yourself for not working out. If you really want to do some exercise, put the phone down and do 5 pushups right now. That was really quick, right? Doing 5 more next time you randomly decide to do 5 pushups will be a minute of your time at most.\n\nI have no idea what your job was or what level in your career you're at, but you can take little steps to improve that, too! Werther, it's a portfolio, a CV that needs polishing up, work on that little by little, make phone calls, and send in those applications. Try to think of contacts you may have who could know of an open job for you.\n\nLife gets hard on us sometimes. The last thing you need is to be so hard on yourself!",

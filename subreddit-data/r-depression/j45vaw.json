            "comment": "yes, I have a theory.\n\nI still live in the same room I grew up in, i'm twenty five and since the day I turned 18 I've been trying to move out. When I was younger I had money saved, had a job, and generally had motivation. My parents told me because they were paying my way through college I had to live at home while I wasn't there, so they knew they weren't wasting money. Well college took much longer than expected, add cocaine addiction to it and now I'm broke so I don't have anywhere else to go. (I stopped coke years ago but the money situation hardly changed) Depression hits hard often, so I  can never hold down a job for more than a few weeks. I really liked my last 3 jobs and I lost them all due to breakdowns keeping me out of work. Finally finished my degree like 3 days ago and had the feeling of : Holy shit I can move on now, the obligation is over and this house reminds me of so much trauma I'm going to improve vastly when I can sleep somewhere that isn't THIS room.\n\nWell, like every night in my room, I pop pills to fall asleep. I wake up depressed having forgot all about my ideas the night before. My room although it causes me anxiety it at least helps me get out of bed as the fear is less appealing the more I think about a shower. I think it had maybe been four days since I finished my degree. It's a funny thing being aware of the ability to move on and letting it wash over you as if it's closer to a dream. I want to move on from this place (but first school, now first my addiction, now first getting therapy, now first etc)\n\nEvery so often we can't escape the mental box we've created to keep us comfortable. I feel this in a physical sense as well as i'm sure you do. Escaping a mental place of comfort leads to growth, so it should appear. These physical places of comfort however, seem like a necessary bastion and without them we can feel so drained without a home base to let our gaurd down. Becoming uncomfortable in my room was the first step to doing something about it. So I'm working a bit, not much. I see a therapist, I look for new, better jobs. I think I will become mentally comfortable with this struggle until I consider my freedom. I can hardly sleep anywhere but this room and I can hardly sleep in this room.\n\nNo revelations, I think things will stay this way untill I grow up in a sense. I have scary responsibilities in my future. I think i'll find my own home when the time is right, It feel like the years passing me by tells the story of someone who can move on but is simply choosing not to. selfishly indulging in what makes me feel week and unable is a good way to avoid responsibility. \n\nThat isn't what I want, today like every day I need to pop a pill to go to sleep. So I guess today I stay awake. Maybe tomorrow when I normally lay in bed and feel sorry I will remember that I can do something about it.\n\nYeah, I wanna go home. I'm glad I found home within myself, I hope it gives me the strength to make the million small steps to finding my own place. I think I can do it, were humans feeling discomfort, so there must be something to be done.",

So moving a piece of furniture or two, changing where the table lights are (lighting is a hugger factor!), having specific scents, it all contributes to changing the feel of your bedroom. I used to have candles but now I rely on incense sticks (cheaper, more scent, and easier to space out), and one of those steam scent humidifier things. I got a cheap one (8 dollars the one time I used a flash sale on amazon) and slowly built up my collection of oils, and that has lasted soooo long. I dont use it every day. But it really sets the mood for relaxing into sleep or to get motivated and clean up my room. It just helps change the tone and feel of a room and my perception of it enough that I can move forward.",

But a home is also security - it is the trust and reassurance that your possessions and you yourself are safe and protected within those walls. A home is also belonging. It is the understanding that the space belongs to you and that you belong in the space. Sometimes that feeling comes from living with friends or family, sometimes that comes from buying your own place, sometimes it comes from just making it your own, but simply being placed in a building does not automatically make you feel at home. \n\nYou said that you haven\u2019t had a home for years despite \u201calways having a place to stay.\u201d This kind of sounds to me like you\u2019ve maybe around a bit? You\u2019ve maybe had a few different apartments/places, or maybe crashed with friends or stayed with family here or there? If that\u2019s the case, I can understand entirely why you wouldn\u2019t feel at home. Do you feel like the places you stay are just temporary? Like you don\u2019t want to really \u201csettle in\u201d in case you need to leave again?\n\nI really hope that things can turn around for you and you can find a place that you can truly call home.

I wasnt close with them, and I kind of felt slightly uncomfortable in their house (it was smaller, less entertainment options, and stricter than my parents) and I didnt really understand to connect with them. But that place was clearly a home. And the way I mourned them was from the loss of that place. My aunt owned it for a while and updated it to rent, and then the renters bought it. But through that I realized none of the three houses I had lived in as a kid were ones I was as emotionally attached to and thought of as a \"home\". It wasnt really quite *my* home, but it was the closest I had to it aside from my parents house. But my parents almost actively seemed to engender this idea that no place was a safe place, especially my mom. She loudly telegraphed her anxiety from her divorce, her lack of financial trust in my dad, and then eventually when I was a teen and not doing enough to cement my financial future, she made it very clear that i wasnt welcome in *her* house if I wasnt doing enough to contribute, but when i did, it was never enough. She was always projecting her own anxieties onto me and everyone else, expecting us to take them away. (It was \"our\" house when she was a stay at home mom, but when she got a job and dad was unemployed it was suddenly *her* house and still is even when everyone has a job and contributes financially and she isnt the one paying the mortgage atm). The only way she knows how to value herself is in the idea that our family would turn into apes if she stopped taking too much onto herself. \n\nAnd then i moved out for a while into sketchy apartment situations with sketchy people, and there were other people that were home. But they are gone now too. So now the prophecy is fulfilled, she told me there was no security, so now there is no security for me. You can't depend on other people? I didnt.  The only home and security I find is in stories, in other peoples heads.",

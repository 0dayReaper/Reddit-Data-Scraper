    "postText": "You know the feeling - you're hungry and open the friedge but everything in there looks disgusting. So you either give up and don't eat or force down something that is completely unsatisfying. That is every part of my life right now.\n\nI don't know how else to explain it. I have energy now (with my meds) and an urge to be doing something, but nothing seems appealing. \n\nWhen I do things, I don't feel good about it or pleasure. But if I sit around doing nothing, I feel the urge to be doing something.\n\nI don't know what to do or how to explain it.\n\nEDIT: Holy crap. Thank you everyone for the likes and awards and comments. It makes me feel connected and a little less alone. I will try to reply to all the comments.",

Being hungry and staring at a fridge where none of the food looks good is a shitty feeling. It sucks and there is no way around that. \n\nFor me, it has been so important to validate that feeling. Being hungry is miserable. Opening the fridge is miserable. Life is miserable and that is okay.\n\nI am not in direct control of my feelings. I feel like shit and that is a fact. But, I am in control of my behavior. Faced with my current situation - a fridge full of food that looks completely unappetizing - I can not eat, I can force down a protein shake, I can make my favorite food and hope it tastes a little better than the warm chalky vanilla they shove into a bottle and call a protein shake. \n\nAll of these options require a varying amount of energy and have a varying probability of helping in the long run. Some days, I'm lucky to even have the mental and physical energy to open the fridge. Some days, I can make a full dinner.\n\nThe most helpful thing any therapist or person has ever done for me is to just look at me and say \"that sucks. I'm sorry.\" Validation is key.\n\nThe least helpful thing any therapist or person has ever done for me is to look at me and say \"just do it anyway.\" To me, it dismisses how hard it is for me and how no matter how hard I try there is no reward.",

I would never use such blunt viewpoints in person but the essence of the matter is still such that instinctual emotions really do not matter. \n\nI should have clarified that cognitive FEELINGS about our lives and our hopes and dreams are the absolute most important things in life. But the instinctual emotions of fear, shame, guilt, regret and negative self talk, are completely wasteful and they mean nothing. \n\nOur brains like consistency. That's why it's so hard to break out of negative self talk and harm. Its literal self sabotage!",

It's something I struggle with a lot personally, especially the negative self-talk, but I'm taking baby steps.

So why bother eating, just to fill up for now so I can eat more bland food that I don't want to eat in the future? \n\nThere's nothing appealing in the grocery store of life. I don't want to have to buy all the ingredients and slave away in the kitchen to make a single satisfying meal. Especially when I don't even know what the meal I'm going to make is. There are so many outside variables and it's just so tiring. I'd rather eat the processed food of \"video games\" and \"drugs\" but I know it's bad for me. But everytime I start getting into good habits, I eat one \"processed meal\" and I'm back where I started.",

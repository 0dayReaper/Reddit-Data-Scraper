    "postText": "It\u2019s tiring. I\u2019m exhausted. I hate it because I feel like I\u2019m being so irrational. When I try to suppress it, I literally feel chest pains at a point I have to pause everything I do even if I\u2019m in the middle of work or a meeting. I hate it when I\u2019m in public because I hate explaining myself to everyone that probably don\u2019t even care about me. \n\n\nThis is why I chose to stay at home most of my days. I just want to be left alone. But being alone creates more void in my life and just feel stuck. \n\n\nI\u2019ve read many posts here and I know I\u2019m not the only one who experiences this. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s sadder that there are a lot of people out there feeling the same way that I do or should I be comforted with that fact?",

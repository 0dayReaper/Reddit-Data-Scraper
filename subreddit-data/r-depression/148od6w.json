    "postText": "I do talk to people in my life about my depression, but it can be hard to give them the full picture, as they often see me on my good days.\n\nI am 30. Since the age of 21, I have experienced bouts of depression. I went on Citalopram at 21. I have gone off it a few times, but I pretty much consider myself permanently on it now - it has never gone well to go off it. \nI probably haven't given therapy a fair chance - I did group CBT for low mood, individual CBT for anxiety (both through NHS). Then last year after suffering a breakdown (situational - accumulation of stressful events, couldn't cope, came out the other side with awful brain fog), I did Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for a few months.\nDepression has ruined parts of every phase of my life since I started experiencing it. At uni, I remember phases of not being able to get up out of bed, of cancelling lots of plans. At the time I wasn't good at talking about it.\nAt my first job out of uni, I kept ending up off sick. Lots of days of not being able to do anything other than be in bed, get up to pee and eat.\nThe same is true for when I did my master's after that, the PhD I started, the job I had after that (that was probably my worst bout of depression - I found it VERY hard to get out of), the job I have now.. The only thing that has changed is I find it easier to get out of a depressive funk - I'll be in bed for a couple of days, then, because I know it gets harder and harder to recover, I manage to get myself back into the world.\n\nBut my current problem is, the good days don't last. For months now, I've had trouble going to work and having normal days. I'll have a few good days, then back to bad. Dating and emotional stress that came from dating exacerbated it, so I've stopped. But that hasn't magically made me better. Now I'm just sad/distressed without dating to blame, and sad that I won't be able to get into a relationship, because I want a few months of being emotionally stable first.\n\nI am well educated, I have plenty of friends, I take dance classes. My job is well paid - I don't like my job anymore but I don't really think right now is a good time to be applying for other things. The city I live in is amazing. There shouldn't be anything wrong, yet there is. My life should be easy to live.\n\nYet every morning, I can't face getting up, I can't face the things I need to do, and a lot of the time, when I do manage to face things, I don't enjoy it at all. I don't know why I can't get better.",

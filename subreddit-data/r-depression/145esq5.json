    "postText": "Please help, someone's kind words, someone's talk about the weather, or a compliment, or what I can to help myself will really keep me alive right now.\n\nThings have never been this bad , I've never felt this level of empty and ready to just walk into a busy road and hope to God I get hit. I am so damaged, I am such a complex, vulnerable and sensitive character that nobody really under cared to ever understand, not even my own mother.\n\nThe greatest pain of my life is the acceptance and realisation that I am too ugly and that nobody will ever marry/be in a relationship with me. But the greatest, unbearable pain is surrounding the fact that I will never be a mother.  I am 25 and all my attempts at looking for my perfect ending has failed, I, have failed.\n\nI am on my period currently (day 2) and didnt have much of a PMS  stage ( unsure if this is hormonally related but I have honestly never been this bad and manage my depression well enough day to day). I have been up since 3am unable to get back to sleep, and have anxiety sleeping tonight incase it happens again. Unsure if this is hormonelly related?\n\nI feel like I've ran out of time. Everytime I get another period, my heart breaks. Another egg gone to waste, It hurts so bad seeing other couples, though nothing hurts more than seeing pregnant women, children, forumale milk, nappies, pregnancy adverts. I have cut so many friends off as I physically cant bear it.\n\nMy thoughts are scaring me so much right now , I really dont know what to do any more. ",

We all have our own struggles we have to deal with in life, some tougher than the others. I just try to not take life too seriously :). Take care.",

I can't even begin to imagine what it feels like, but, being treated for major depression for the better part of 20-25 years is a burden I've come to accept. Try to give yourself the grace and acceptance to get through one day at a time and don't be so hard on yourself. I know these are just words, but I've been to the suicidal ideation part a few times myself. Being somewhat of a coward and not wanting to upset my family and friends has kept me from the bitter end I thought I was headed for. I honestly hope you find some peace and happiness \ud83d\ude0a",

It's painful, it feels like you cannot regain that time, I guess you wonder if the wait is worth it at all. I personally think forming a connection with other people is key to getting the most out of life and if even your own parent feels distant there then it's that much harder, who do you turn to?\n\nI guess the problem with forming such a connection is the chance of finding someone who you can truly feel at ease with, someone to accept your struggles, even if they cannot take them all away, but someone who you can share the burden with.\n\nI think the best we can do is keep trying, even if it gets hard. By quitting we cut any chance of achieving that. I know it's hard to think of it like that and I don't like sugaring the words and making false promises but I guess it comes down to the question: are you willing to keep trying to maybe find peace one day? I don't know you personally but I like to believe you want to do good in this world, I assume maybe one day be a better mother than your own if you don't feel like she was truly there for you.",

My wife and I adopted our daughter last year, and she is amazing.",

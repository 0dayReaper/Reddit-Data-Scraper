    "postText": "I have this feeling of not wanting to be alive and the fact is, I\u2019m not even sad ,depressed or wanting to end it myself. The best way I can describe the feeling is that there is a feeling of nostalgia. I would see movies or hear music of the 90s and even early 2000s. For some reason it feel like I\u2019m out of place and I think I should have died in that era. I feel like I\u2019m in a different timeline or something and feel out of place or that I don\u2019t feel like I should\nbelong here. I have plenty of friends and family so im not alone or anything .Anyone know what this feeling is and relate or is there a word for it?",

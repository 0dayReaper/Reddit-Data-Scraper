If you can get a dog you should, it is a love-sponge you can just go all out on. Buy him nice food, like a juicy rib eye, take him for long walks in the woods, spoil him in every way.",

Their own story, own beginnings, own experiences, ect...\n\nPerhaps they never encountered someone like you, perhaps they lived a life of less empathy than you.\n\nWhatever the case may be, they most likely don't understand you, because most good people won't put you down because you have mental Illness.\n\nIn the end though, whatever they may say to you, understand that your depression is your responsibility.\n\nYou may say, \"sometimes I can't help it\" and that's fine. I've been there plenty of times and probably plenty more in the future, but nobodies going to fix me, but me.\n\nIf they want to help, then by all means, let them, but at the end of the day, if they don't want to be around you because of your depression, that's their choice to make.\n\nCan you truly blame them? You know how exhausting it can be, imagine someone else who doesn't understand it try to tackle it.\n\nThat's the cruel nature of it all. Those afflicted often don't know how to fix it and can't do it alone, while those who aren't often don't want to engage in it.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, unless they're being deliberately cruel to you, don't hold it against them.

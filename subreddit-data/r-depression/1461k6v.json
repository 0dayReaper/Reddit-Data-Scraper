    "postText": "Have lost my compass in this life. Cried out to God, no answer, pray every day for direction. Yet there never is an answer. I tell myself I should be grateful, I have a home, my health so i think. a job a vehicle I should be, but I have nothing that fulfills me brings me joy, so I'm angry cynical having hate and rage in my heart and I don't want to be that human being. Yet I can't seem to find my way nor are people hearing my cries for help. But there is no shortage of fuckfaces who want to help if I'm paying, what the fuck ever happened to likeminded people helping other's because they know what and how hard it is to pull oneself up out of that mind set.

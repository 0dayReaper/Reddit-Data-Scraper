    "postText": "The past few days I've felt like crap because of something I did and something I regret. Mind you I was very intoxicated and didn't know what was going on. Nor do recall anything from that night except for the parts I remember  I wish I could just take it all back. I puked on your bed and basically fucked up that whole night. I've been crying since I left your apartment. I feel so disgusted of myself. The fact I've self harmed so bad the past few days. But it's coming to the point where I want to die because what I did. I'm so sorry for what I did to you and I hope we can talk again someday. I didn't mean any of it.",

It often makes me feel like an afterthought; a courtesy invite. \n\nI don't feel a lot of meaningful connection with anyone and it feels harder than ever to connect.\n\nI used to have the capacity to meet girls but it just doesn't happen organically anymore, dating apps seem dystopian, I have minimal drive to even try.\n\nI have been successful enough with an office job (now wfh) but I don't really care that much about it and have been coasting on minimal effort for years. There's no progression, just going through the motions for a paycheck. I really dislike the corporate world.\n\nI've lost interest in most of my hobbies. I still game but it feels very hollow and pointless most of the time\n\nI've been in therapy for years and I keep going but I'm not sure there's much more to be gained\n\nAs soon as I wrap up my daily responsibilities I don't know how to kill the time. It feels almost impossible to not drink and smoke until I fall asleep.\n\nNone of this is new. I feel like a loser. I feel very hopeless.",

I wish I could offer something, but all I can say is that everything you just said is me, if the solidarity does anything for you.\n\nIt just really sucks because I keep trying my best. I\u2019ve done so much and tried meeting new people and stay connected with the old ones, but it\u2019s difficult. Like you said, everyone else I know has a family or is starting one, and it\u2019s like I\u2019ve just been left behind. Video games kept me going for a while, along with many other hobbies, but now l just don\u2019t feel anything, no matter how much time I pour into them.\n\nI swear my therapist is working against me, and the few people I can open up to just gives me the \u201cthat sucks, you need to try more\u201d as if I haven\u2019t been doing everything I can to help myself feel better. Sadly, hopeless sums me up perfectly.",

Unfortunately despite the best efforts of many wise and well-informed people (notably Susan Cain), there's still a prevailing assumption that extraversion is healthy and introversion is not.  \n\nDo you know about where you sit on the introvert  &gt; extravert axis?  \n\n(Personally I think introverts are more evolved and much less boring than extraverts but I'm quite sure I'm extremely biased ::wink::)",

Im comfortable being alone if I look past the moments spent ruminating about my life and scrolling on my phone after work or whatever. I don\u2019t like large groups of people and prefer a small handful of closer connections. Have a lot of social anxiety. It\u2019s hard for me to meet new people now. I got by when I was younger by meeting people through work, friends of friends, etc. Without that crutch I\u2019m so uncomfortable.",

It's much easier to bond over shared values and serious interests, in my observation, because those are the sorts of things that correlate with depth of rapport and quality of the interpersonal connection.  \n\nBut self-isolating because we're ruminating is still a bitch.  \n\n&gt;  Have a lot of social anxiety\n\nYeah, me too.  I was in grad school by the time I more-or-less stopped hiding in a storeroom, unused classroom, or even the bathroom (gross AF in retrospect) to each lunch because I couldn't face the cafeteria.  Now I've reached the point where connecting with people, including new people, is a strong skill of mine, but it's still draining if I try to do it too much.",

Despite how much I try and go out, I just end up feeling even more tired and unsuccessful, retreat to bed, and then wish I just would\u2019ve stayed in bed all day after work anyway. The emptiness is real. While I do hope you are able to find something that lights a fire in you, I can\u2019t blame you at all for just staying in. It\u2019s what I wish I did more. And it\u2019s something I still do quite a bit, since a lot of days I just literally can\u2019t do anything else but collapse into bed.",

That I can see in the lack of interest in old hobbies or dating. \n\nbut first, I'm going to suggest going inside yourself.  Quiet Meditation. (null mind meditation if you can get there - but just start by finding quiet.)  maybe some Yoga - but at home and alone. \n\nWhen I was at my worse place my mind was full of loud random thoughts and internal discussions; mostly going off about how much of a loser I was.  i couldnt make any progress untill I could muffle that. \n\nI did do some of the muffling by being responsible. Doing the work at work, the crap at the house. just focusing on that to shut the other thoughts out.  eventually thats been key to keep me alive.",

But i think that in a couple of years i might be in a very similar position to yours. And I would gome that someone would tell something like that. There is no point in suicide.

    "postText": "Hello guys, I'm feeling really overwhelmed by everything. \n\nThis is my last year of high school and it's been pretty alright until a couple of days ago. Halfway through the year I joined an afternoon study group and the last meeting was on Monday. I don't know how but in May out of the blue I fell in love with a girl in this group (she is one year younger than me). \n\nI didn't fully realize it until last Monday when it sunk into me that this was the last time I'd see her. I wanted to strike a conversation but she left early for good. I have now the finals exam and I'm going to college, never to see her again. When I turned to look at her and to talk and noticed that she was gone I felt ten times heavier and that feeling hasn't left me. \n\nI'm stuck in this awful mood now, i tried to contact her through social medias but I don't even know her name (we didn't speak a lot and when I figured out what I felt it was already too late). I'm here with just her face burned in my brain, trying to study for my exams but with very little motivation (I'm crying in the shower as I'm typing this). I don't really know what to do.",

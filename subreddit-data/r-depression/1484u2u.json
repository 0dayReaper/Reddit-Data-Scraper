    "postText": "I feel like something broke in me a long time ago. And now it\u2019s too late to fix it. Every time I think I\u2019ve gotten better it gets worse. Like, maybe if I had gotten therapy at a younger age. Maybe if someone had noticed. If they had noticed how self-aware I was at ten years old. How much I was aware of opinions and hatred and how I acted. Maybe I could\u2019ve been salvaged, glued back together while the cracks were all superficial. It\u2019s too late now. I\u2019ve been broken for god knows how long. All life lessons I\u2019ve learned have taught me that no matter how hard I try, I\u2019m just going to be broken. That\u2019s who I am. No matter how much I grow, there\u2019s always going to be something wrong with me. I\u2019m always going to hate myself.",

As I travel along this road I have to remember to try and be kind to myself, easier said than done most days. One day at a time. Right now, for the first time in several decades I\u2019m actually feeling lighter than usual, I\u2019m not sure why or what has changed but I\u2019m waiting for the heaviness to come back, I know it will, it\u2019s just a matter of time. I hear you.",
